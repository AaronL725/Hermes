**UPDATE 26 Sept 2011 : I used in past years this ea in real account and deplated it very fast after few consecutive losses occurred !!_So be advise that this trading system doesn't work in anyway under any market conditions and currency pairs used at least not in the long run (+2 years)_. Consider this thread only as a mere excercise to learn how to not trade forex market.  
I'll not remove this first post so that other newbie trader (as I was at that time) can learn something from my errors.  
**  
  
Hi Firebirders ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I started here a new fresh thread about further improvement based on Firebird EA v0.63G engine that seems actually the best version ever made with incredible performance tested by a lot of users in old post.  
I will try, as much as i can, to update regularly this first post so every news,settings,fix will be written here.   
I wish to thanks to all users that in old thread help to improve Firebird in particular **Mono** for testing and sharing his result and setting to FF users.   
  
**[How it works Firebird ?]**  
(taken from EA code)  
_Firebird calculates a 10 day SMA and then shifts it up and down based on a percentage to form a channel.  
For the calculation of this SMA either close (more trades) or H+L (safer trades) is used.   
When the price breaks a band a postion in the opposite of the current trend is taken. If the position goes against us we simply open an extra position to average (pipstep function).   
To avoid enter a trade while a strong trend is in place a divergence function is used that is calculated as difference between a Faster SMA (by default set to 23) and a Slower SMA (by default set to 84)._  
  
* **Firebird v0.63g** :   
\- Our loved EA ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) This version it seems to be a pips machine , implement pipstep to average position and divergence to avoid strong trend.   
  
* **Firebird v1.0a** :   
\- Based on Firebird v0.63g engine.   
\- Fixed bug that prevent to all JPY pairs to enter often a trade due to a calculation error on divergence function.   
\- Removed looping print about Account Equity on Expert tab.  
\- Deleted override settings if you use TF30 timeframe chart.  
  
* **Firebird v1.0c (modified by Wackena)**  
\- Average daily range calculated automatically using ATR on past 21 days, there is no more need to setup manually StopLoss,TakeProfit and Pipstep, they are all calculated automatically.  
\- Added Money Management routine. If you want to manually set lot size, set UseMM=0(false)  
\- Added MaxOpenOrders routine to add control as to max number of open orders at one time per pair. If not wanted, set MaxOpenOrders=10.  
\- Added Trailing stop function  
  
**[Firebird Settings (based on Mono's settings)]**  
\- Firebird_settings_v1.0.zip : Contains two versions of preset files that seems to works better :  
  
1) Mono's fixed setting (Mono_settings_fixed_v1.0.zip): Fixed tp=30, sl=300, pipstep=30 for all pairs   
2) Mono's variable setting (Mono_settings_variable_v1.0.zip) : different setting for each pair based on average daily range (in pips). Take profit (TP), Stop loss (LS) and PipStep are calculated with these formulas :  
_TP = Daily Avg Range*2/10 , SL = Daily Avg Range*2 , PipStep = Daily Avg Range/10  
_  
  
EUR/USD TP=22 SL=220 PIPSTEP=11 (Daily Avg Range = 110)  
GBP/USD TP=30 SL=300 PIPSTEP=15 (Daily Avg Range = 150)  
USD/CHF TP=25 SL=250 PIPSTEP=12 (Daily Avg Range = 125)  
EUR/JPY TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=10 (Daily Avg Range = 105)  
USD/JPY TP=20 SL=200 PIPSTEP=10 (Daily Avg Range = 100)  
USD/CAD TP=21 SL=210 PIPSTEP=10 (Daily Avg Range = 105)  
AUD/USD TP=16 SL=160 PIPSTEP=8 (Daily Avg Range = 80)  
EUR/CHF TP=10 SL=100 PIPSTEP=5 (Daily Avg Range = 50)  
EUR/GBP TP=9 SL=90 PIPSTEP=5 (Daily Avg Range = 45)  
AUD/JPY TP=15 SL=150 PIPSTEP=7 (Daily Avg Range = 75)  
  
* Mono's chart time frame : M1 (1 minute chart)

Hi Skyline,  
  
Thank you so much for your hard work with these forums and contributions to the Firebird community. This new thread is an excellent idea. The other one is just short of 70 pages. :-)   
  
I hope to be able to contribute test results, and thoughts and ideas, as I'm not at all as experienced as most here are on the programming aspect of it.   
  
Welcome to all the Firebird regulars, and Firebird newcomers.

Hi all,  
  
I did have a question regarding the Percent setting. What does changing it from 0.1 to 0.15 do?

It prevents less trade from opening because the envelope calculation that Firebird uses is a wider.

The problem is with the default 'percent' setting. Change the 'percent' setting to a value between .1 and .2 rather than 2.

What you're suggesting here is akin to the "UseCloseSignal" and surf feature we tried on firebird/phoenix.

Thanks Mr.Trader for sharing your ideas ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
This could be a great improvement but i'm scared about huge number of opened trades at the same time and possibility of a margin call.   
May be right strategy could be to start EA without hedging and when account deposit will grow , enable it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
Another possibility could be to use hedging with fixed settings (tp=30,sl=300,pipstep=30) and/or in chart timeframe higher than M1 where less trade are opened. Infact looking at latest Mono's statement with variable settings (when he achieved 9000 pips) , there is 41 opened trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)   
Btw, i'm a programmer (it's my actual work) but i'm not quite good with mql language to develop this kind of procedure. If we can find some well-written procedure for hedging may be i could try to merge it in latest Firebird version.

Hi Skyline,  
  
Thank you for your hard work and all the members of this thread (and its predecessors) for the valuable contributions in developing Firebird. Your results are really impressive. (I tested an earlier version of Firebird a couple of weeks ago with moderate results. Next week I will try with the v1.0a version in the hope of a great success.)  
  
I also think that building a hedging possibility in is a good idea.  
I am not a programmer though I think straddle EAs contain a hedging procedure so some of them might be useful. I do not think posting such EAs here would be nice but I am ready to send some by email or at this link [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...3&page=1&pp=15](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showthread.php?t=5913&page=1&pp=15) one can find a lot of them.

Wow, this is a truly impressive group!  
  
Where should I go if I have no clue how to load, set-up, launch, or adjust settings of Firebird?

Hello Moneybags:  
  
Are your results running the platform 24-7 for the entire two weeks and through all the reports? If so that is amazing.

We need to have a tutorial on how to install and operate and EA. Anyhow the .set file should be in the Experts directory folder. You can put one there manually by using Windows Explorer or you can save one from the Firebird settings screen. To add firebird to the chart from the navigator menu simply drag it with your mouse to the chart. A settings window will come up. Make sure that "Allow Live Trading" is set under the "Common" Tab. The other tab you can edit the EA settings.

Nice, tight float level. That has to be due to excluding cable.

skyline,  
  
attached is Firebird_v1.0c with a routine added to auto-calculate variable settings. I followed Mono's calculation as you posted above. Backtest results comparing v.10a & v1.0c is attached. v1.0c did much better with almost 4 times more orders, but had several loses. Even with the loses, the overall profit was up.  
  
This EA has 3 other routines added: UseMM which is a Money Management routine. If you want to manually set lot size, set UseMM=0(false). Another is a MaxOpenOrders routine to add control as to max number of open orders at one time per pair. If not wanted, set MaxOpenOrders=10. And the 3rd is a Trailing Stop routine. If not wanted, set TrailingStop=0.  
  
Maybe a few members can forward test to see if results are better.  
  
Also, I have posted Firebird_v1.0b on mr.trader's new thread at [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...33&postcount=8](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=86533&postcount=8)  
  
This EA has a hedging routine added to help control high float sizes.

Does anyone know how Mano got his information for "daily average range." I am interested in trying to get that for the GBPJPY currency pair.  
  
Any help would be appreciated.

Check the post again, because I had added 3 addtional routines, rather than 2.

Does anyone have a copy of the Firebird document by Traderseven newer than ver .27? I have ver .20 and .27 in MHTML and PDF. I don't want to post a version that is older than what others have. I would post the HTML version so we could edit it to match the settings options now available.

Yes, this is running the system 24/7 for the 2 weeks.   
Nothing was touched. No manual trade closing or anything like that.  
  
The 30-300-30 refers to the Take Profit - Stop Loss - Pip Step values.

That's correct. All currencies where on the 1 minute timeframe. And above you can see what 30-300-30 stands for. (TP-SL-PipStep)

That definitely helps. It was as low as -$160 Friday morning. And I had already booked about $1700.

Ok. I will list the steps and you can see if yours are correct.  
  
1\. close MT4  
2\. right click on start button left corner. left click on explore.  
3\. Scroll down until you find program files and click on the + sign.  
4\. scroll down until you find your [broker](http://www.forexfactory.com/index.php?page=forex_brokers) MT4 folder and click on the + sign  
5\. here in the experts folder is where you place the firebird EA. (not in the indicator folder)  
6\. Start your MT4 program back up.  
7\. Make sure you Navigator window is open on the left side, below the currency prices.  
8\. scroll thru the navagtor until you find the firebird EA.  
9\. Drag that EA into your chart window.   
10\. Right click in your chart window and select Expert Advisors and then select properties.  
10\. this will bring up the menu of settings.  
11\. You can adjust the settings to any that you have found in this thread or use your own.   
12\. select the common tab and make sure the Allow Live Trading is selected  
13\. press ok.   
14\. go to the top of the program and make sure that the menu tab for Expert Advisors shows a green arrow and not a red x. if the red x is present, just press the tab and it will go green.  
15\. You should now have a smiley face in the right hand corner of your screen.  
  
Please ignore the steps you already know. I have no idea what your level is...  
  
hope this helps...

I think i fried my brain reading the 70 pages on the other thread.  
  
question for ya:  
  
If i wanted to try this on a micro account.. say 300 bucks total. How many pairs can i trade? And what broker should i use? FXDD? InterbankFX?  
  
Would I need to adjust the lot size from 0.1 on a micro?   
  
I got version 1 running on demo on 4 pairs 30-300-30 setup. lets see what happens this week.  
  
Great thread!!!! VERY promising.  
  
Thanks... keep up the good work!

The way I did it is, got the daily high and low from july 04 til july 06, worked out the daily difference and then averaged it out.  
  
AVG * 2 = SL  
SL / 10 = TP & Pipstep  
  
For the more adventurous   
  
SL / 20 = pipstep

We have come to the conclusion that in order to trade this EA safely you need $1000 per pair on a mini account. On a micro account I guess that would work out to $100 per pair. So if you have $300 then no more than 3 pairs. You might even want to start with 2 if you want to be really safe.  
The broker is up to you. I use IBFX and so do many others. I have no experience with FXDD, but I've heard decent things about them.  
  
If you open a mini account then leave the lot size as 0.1 (regular acct the lot should be 0.01 for a micro)  
0.1 in a regular account is 1 mini lot, and in a mini account 0.1 is a micro lot.  
  
Hope that helps.  
Good luck with your test and live results if you go ahead with it.

so let me get this straight...   
  
300 bucks in a micro account. 3 pairs max.. maybe 2. eur/usd usd/cad example.  
  
set lot size in EA to 0.01 if in micro account.  
  
If allready in a mini account just leave at 0.1 ?  
  
So if i had 1000.00 in a mini account... i could trade with 10 pairs theoretically?  
  
Mono, what broker do you use?  
  
Thanks for quick response.

i have read and/or skimmed through most of the postings concerning firebird and thought:  
  
If a S/L is triggered then probably the currency pair is headed or in a major trend. correct?  
  
So if that is so, is there a way to change the code that automatically increases the width of the channel? does this make sense?  
  
After this if there is a profitable trade with the currency pair it slowly reduces the width of the channel back down to what it was before over a period of trades.

well on the original 70 page thread someone was trading with micro lots live.. dunno who it was.  
  
i really don't want to skim 70 pages again to find who.  
  
And i don't want to use a 1000 bucks live account to try it out either.   
  
Thanks!

Wackena, Hope you could give a little feed back on this system.  
Can you clearify how the system work when the trade goes against you.  
  
Why not use a set stop loss?  
  
Another idea I have considered is how about shifting the moving average forward so the price exceeds yesterdays value of the moving average not today mov value. todays moving average value is changing.  
  
  
In the current system is v1.oc does the have the seting for several currency or does the systme need to be changed for each currency?  
  
Thanks for you feedback

I just have 2 questions, I hope you will help me out.  
  
1- What is "pipstep" mean?  
2- I tried to open the attached new version of Firebird, but I cant open it, because there is no comparable programs to work with it, so I want to know what platform or what program do I need to get it read the codes of Firebird?  
  
My appreciation for your help!

I looked through the statements and the backtest results are very impressive.   
I'm planning to run two forward tests paralell on v1.0b and v1.0c with the same broker on the four majors. After a week we could evaluate the results.

Hello all, I am new to FF and have been going through the massive amounts of posts regarding this system for the last couple of days. I was just wondering if anyone could tell me the current flaws with this system, and why a lot of people here regard this early version of Firebird as the most profitable?  
  
I know there is a Phoenix 2.1 out there now as well. What is the main reason you have decided to stay with this version?  
  
I would love to help out with the development of this and am just trying to get to grips with the research that has already been done.. not an easy task. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I just tried backtesting this on GBPUSD, I ended up 20% less money after 5 months of data.  
  
I did not modify anything on the expert properties and used "every tick" data to backtest. Am I doing something wrong here???

Hi guys,  
  
I am a little bit confused. This Firebird EA does exist for years. As far as I know, no major improvment has been made to it, and it has been tested by many people in the past (including me), and it has always ended up blowing accounts, sooner or longer, after some wild ride.  
Can somebody please clarify if there is some major improvment in the current version that makes it reliable now ? I remember the 63G version, but I am not sure if it's the same...Are there just a new set of parameters that would make it successful now ?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

I think 1.0b is going to beat 1.0c hands down. Should be interesting. I cannot wait for the market to open.

You know, i do not mean to be mean -- but you guys asking the same questions that have already been asked and answered several times before really need to do some reading. It makes me a bit upset when people want to be spoonfed everything instead of just investing some time to read. If one cannot spend some time learning then they shouldn't be trading Forex --with or without an EA.

GBPUSD is the achilles heel of this EA. Try doing the backtest on EURUSD or USDCAD instead.

A few of us as been working on refining Firebird for a few months now -- Hendrick, Wackena and Skyline have done a great job with programming improvements and MOno is our master tester... So far so good.

Doc,  
Firebird was designed for slight trending, sine wave cyclic market. It is not that critical where order entry is made. It depends on the cyclic market going up & down. It makes most profits when it enter orders to go in the wrong direction. It uses the pipstep function to enter multiple orders with the assumption that market will retrace. The problem that has always existed with Firebird, is the big Stoploss needed to allow cyclic movement and the negative effect of news events. If several orders are open when news comes out, it's really a coin toss if the effect will be good or back. It is the concept from this forum that hedge orders (Firebird_v1.0b) and variable pair settings (Firebird_v1.0c) could help minimize news event effect. Time will tell with forward testing if these concepts are valid. What I can say for certain is, that you can't out think the market all of the time. If you are looking for the get rich quick scheme, in my opinion, this is not the way. If you looking to make a living or some extra money over the long haul, then doing your own Due Diligence is the way to go. Other people will not make money for you, only you will make money for you.   
  
StopLoss is most useful in short sine wave cyclic conditions such as with jpy pairs. With gbp/usd type pair and its wider cyclic waves, StopLoss can prematurely close orders and thus not achieve max potential gains. I personally, would reccommend to carefully use Firebird on gbp/usd. This pair seems to have the longest cyclic trends and this is where excessive pipstep orders occur. I'm trading Firebird with a mini Live account and with gbp/usd, lot size =0.01, remaining pairs, 0.1 and above. Over time and market conditions, gbp/usd has most of the loses. This is not to say the other pairs don't have loses. I've had ouch times with usd/jpy and usd/chf, just not as many times as with gbp/usd.  
  
Firebird_v1.0c can run on all currencies. Settings can be the same for all or individually set as per personal preference. Over the next few weeks, i hope feedback from members, who are forward testing, will report results to this forum. From that data, we may be able to determine if perferred settings for a currency pair is needed.  
  
I've been asked several times what pairs I trade. I trade 9 pairs. eur/usd, gbp/usd, usd/jpy. usd/chf, eur/jpy, eur/chf, usd/cad, aud/usd, gbp/jpy. No logic as to why these. I would recomment to demo as many as you feel comfortable with. This could 1 pair or all available.

Ok.. Just tested it on EURUSD from jan 1 to present. it managed to raise equity from 10K to 11200. $1200 profit?  
  
Umm.. I think the RSI+ATR was doing better managing to x2 equity in the same period.

Personally i don't rely on backtesting, for me it's not so accurate to valuate an EA. I remember an EA on forex-tsd forum based simply on ema cross that in backtest will turn your 10.000$ into a milion $ or something like this, well when i tried in forward test it was a loosing EA.  
Only forward test will tell you if an EA could be profitable.

In backtesting different pairs with v1.0b & v1.0c, I'm a bit concerned over the number of open orders at one time. For those of you that will be forward testing, please also report these numbers along with bottom line resutls.

The RSI+ATR EA has been a big dud for me thus far. Definitely cannot be compared to Firebird.

Hi everyone,  
  
I've been backtesting the Firebird versions a, b, and c, and definitely like versions a and c best. Vesrsion c seems to have a built in function to set the stoploss and trailing stoploss, however when I set them, they don't seem to work (yes, it's in the "Value" section of the expert advisor Input section). Even if I set the trailing stoploss to 50 (and even same with the plain stoploss), I still seem to have times when there is a much greater loss (say, 200 pip loss over many bars). I can't for the life of me understand what I'm doing wrong here. Is this a bug?   
  
I apologise in advance if the answer is obvious, but I'm about ready to pull my hair out on this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I hope these go through. The first is a file showing the backtest results, and the second file is a jpeg showing my settings for the EA. I appreciate any help you can offer.  
  
It would seem that there is a 200 pip stoploss looking at the results, yet I very specifically entered a 25 pip stop.  
  
Thanks again.

Hmm roughly 50% profit in 8 months using TP and SL 25. Not bad at all. I would bet your returns would have been much bigger with a bigger SL say 300 pips.

Although the trailing stop was added to version c, it will not work sometime since it is included in the method "EnterPositionBasedOnOpen". This method will be only invoked when if MathAbs(diverge)<=DivergenceLimit. I think, the correct way to implement the trailing stop is to move the trailing stop out of the "if (MathAbs(diverge)<=DivergenceLimit)".   
  
Thanks!

Yardie,  
  
I agree, if I could ever secure a 50% annual profit in a live account, consistently, I'd certainly be happy. However, my question/issue is that I set a stoploss of 25, yet if you look at the results of the backtest, the stoploss is clearly set at 200 pips. If I set the SL at 25 pips in the EA setup menu (under inputs), shouldn't the SL be 25 pips in my trading log? Yet it has a SL exit planned for 200 pips for each trade.  
  
How can I ensure that the SL set is the SL used in backtesting? Would I have the same problem when forward testing?

Yardie,  
  
In backtesting over 1 month july16 to aug 18, some pairs had 5-8 orders opened at one time. Float amount seems to be lower, just an increase in number of open orders.

Hi Guys  
  
OK, before you say it, i'll say it. **I MUST BE NUTS.**  
  
I have a task for for the people who have been testing firebird long term or those that have had a stoploss.  
  
Go through your statement and only look at your losing trades and check out the charts, to see if at the time of stoploss, how much further did the price move.

If you are using v1.0c, the stoploss is calculated by the EA. What is entered in the inputs is overwritten by the EA. If control over Stoploss is needed, use v1.0a or 1.0b.  
  
The descriptions of the EAs are on the threads where the EAs are posted,

Yeah, I had the same thoughts last week, and have a hedge version running for a couple of days, too early to tell if any good, needs to run a couple of weeks.

Mono,  
  
I appreciate your response, and your absolutely right about the fixed stoploss issue. However, the "c" version had the same problems with a trailing stoploss which you seem to agree could be of use. Have you had any problems setting a trailing stoploss on this EA?  
  
Thanks again.

I haven't used trailing stops on my tests, I like the trade to run its course and see where it takes me.

Hello wackena or skyline,  
  
Mono has put up a interesting thought. Maybe we should send a pending sellstop or buystop order that has 30x lot size and aim for 10PIP at the "stoploss" point of the normal order when the normal order was sent. Then kill it if the "normal" order reach takeprofit.  
  
However I have problem to do the later part - kill the pending order when the original order took profit. Do you guys have any idea how to do that??  
  
I do think Mono's idea is valid.  
  
Thanks.

I've only been doing my testing long enough to incur 2 losses. However in both, had an order been placed in the the opposite direction (bouncing off the stop as support), it would have negated them both. Actually it would have made money on the EUR/USD because I was using your adjusted setttings from the ADR.

This would be great if it's a buy order say 10 pips in the opposing direction, thus reducing the risk of a calamity if the price just keeps dropping (9/11 or the like that could blow the account). However, wouldn't firebird place the order anyway through it's normal logic?

Yes the concept is intruguing. But then the EA would have to keep track of the losing order to create the hedge...and what if the price goes the other way when the 30 lot order is filled?

I've noticed that Firebird v1.0b is only placing hedge orders on initial sells, but not on buys. I will look at code today to try to find out why.

One suggestion while your looking at the code. I think changing the 'string Name_Expert' to match the version number helps keep the results separate.

Wouldn't it have to be 3 standard lots instead of mini lots for 10 pips to make up the difference?

Hi Mr.Trader ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
How much is actually your negative float balance ? Had you got a lot of loss in a row ?  
That popup is written by EA in function LossCheck() when your loss is high so it alert you about that.   
It's displayed when Last Account Equity (red from log file) less Actual Account Equity is more or equal to PipLoss (usually set to 500) * Lotsize (usually set to 0.1) , try to check this value to see if this condition is true.  
  
hope this help you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I noted a few questions about micro accounts and IBFX. I am trading live with IBFX using firebird. If you have a mini account and set the lot size to 0.1 then it will open $1000 positions. You can even use $100 positions if you prefer by setting the lot size to 0.01  
  
I am still on the old 63G Live. Just started looking at the updated versions.

if you have a mini account in interbankfx (say 300 bucks).. i can use 0.1 lots on the EA to open micro lots correct?  
  
and with this i should not trade more than 3 pairs?

The "Excessive Loss" alert is when AccountEquity has loss value as set by the input PipsLoss=500 * Lot Size. You can turn the alert off by waiting and it will reset itself at end of day. 2nd by increasing the PipsLoss input value. Or, comment out the alert line in the code.

Thats a good question Yardie. Seems to work pretty darn good on demo. But unless we can see some live results, it really mean much. We all know demo's don't alwayswork the same as live??

Ver 1.0a is working on my live account with IBFX. Did you follow Wackena's recommendations? It should have fixed the problem. Personally I use 900 or higher for the 'PipsLoss' input.   
  
I do think there is a problem with the feature. I only need to alter 'PipLoss' when I am trading micro or double micro lots.

Yardie,  
I'm using IBFX for a little over a week - nice results. On Mono 6 pairs and 30-300 settings. Doing some intervention...results would be better if I hadn't...at least last week. All in all, it's performing nicely - no issues with broker.

Yardie, I have a mini Live account with IBFX. I've run different EAs for several months. Firebird and it's version for about 6 weeks. So far, no complaints on IBFX Live service. I do have complaints for their Demo service. I've lost 3 demos while running. For no apparent reason, it has "invalid account" in the connection status box. IBFX online support has not been able to correct the problem. I've had to restart with a new account and then it runs OK again. I just don't like losing the ongoing forward test.  
  
I put FB v63g-TS on mini Live account Aug 10 . 9 pairs and so far, 54 wins, 0 loses.

Wackena, I have had the same issue with demo accounts with MT4 itself. Now I am trading an IBFX mini demo with version 1.0c. I will publish weekly results - first 12 hours was looking good though - did not include GBPUSD.

With an initial deposit of $1000, I currently have $305 profit floating loss $43 currently. Position size is 0.1 on an IBFX mini account which is a $1000 position which gives me 3% risk per trade. Using 30-300-30. So far 1 loss which could have been avaided. I have had a few losses on my demo accounts over the past few months. I haven't tried any of the updated versions yet. So far 132 trades with 1 loss which was a manual close due to fear on my part. Market eventually turned so this loss would have been a profit if I hadn't bailed out early.  
  
I am following, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/CAD and AUD/USD (on 1min timeframe - EA set to 30min). I dumped EUR/JPY recently but still have 2 open positions.  
  
I am often tempted to turn off the EA when the float is reasonably low and close all positions and start again. I am managing to resist the urge and let the EA do its stuff. So far so good.  
  
Wiz.

I've been looking for :  
  
FB v63g-TS version of Firebird but can't seem to find it. Is it on this thread or another? If somebody could point me to this EA I would appreciate it.  
  
I've been running the non TS version with good success lately. Thanks for any help here.

Its true. Demo does not usually have requotes and all that stuff.  
  
All thanks for sharing your live results. It seems all the live accounts are with IBFX so far. Good to know they support the EA (maybe because they dont have a dealing desk)?. I am wondering about other brokers.

hi  
  
I going to demo this on a 1 min chart of euro, i've loaded the ea succesfully and turned allow live trading on, is that all I have to do to test upcoming trades?  
  
And is the strategy tester button, is that just for back testing, or do I have to have that on to test it live?  
  
Thanks for you guys patience with us newbies.

You should be set to go. Just make sure you toggled the "Expert Advisers" button on the main toolbar so EA's are allowed to run regardless of each individual chart's settings.

You've got it. It's just for backtesting, something that FB doesn't take too well to ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

It seems everyone is using 1min charts with this EA. Does that mean you also have to change the properties of MA_timeframe to "1" instead of the default "30"? I ask because I have had the EA up and running for almost 24 hours and it has yet to place a single trade.

i also noticed a lot are using 1 min charts. Any reason I should be aware of?  
  
Currently I'm trying it out on 1hour chart of USDJPY with 'percent' set to .05. Just started forward testing on my demo a little over 24 hours ago, so far its opened around 14 trades (i have max open positions set to 5), closed 10 of them in profit, the other 4 are still open but in profit, and will stay that way, thanks to the floating stop. so, sofar no losing trades.  
  
if this continues to perform in a similar fashion for a while (few months forward test). i may take it live to see how it really goes.

I just lowered my percent setting to ".05" after you mentioned it, and the EA initiated a trade almost immediately. As far as I know, the 1min charts seem to produce the best results so far.

glad it got you moving, just be careful to watch it. if its too small it could initiate false signals, so if it opens a lot of bad trades, try widing it a bit.  
  
and as for 1 minutes producing better results, maybe i'll try out 1min and 1hour on the smae pair and see how each perform.  
  
what is everyone setting the MA_timeframe to for their 1minutes, are you using a timeframe of 1? as that seems logical, but i notice that Sister said something about 30.. as for my 1hour i have the timeframe set respectively to 60. i guess i'll just set the 1min respectively at 1 unless using 30 is the best.  
  
thanks for any tips.

as time goes on with my original demo the EA is effectively setting up hedge trades without the need for hedge code. The float is up to 4-5k but the profits are rolling in more (about 10-15/day) as a result, with both long and short trades established on most pairs.

stricko - I think clever Wackena programmed 1.0c to auto-calculate TP/SL/PS levels so that will be why.

Version 1c overides the TP and pipstep based on a calculated 21 day range average. If you want to set the TP manually use 1a.

Ok cool, well it actually helped get the limits hit in this slow market, so i guess it's a good thing. 2nd trade opened, and it's 12 pips up already, I'm using ibfx, seems to work well, goign to try with live micro lots pretty soon, then keep getting heavier as the months go on if it stays successful.

IBFX using the original v63G with 30-300-30 settings. Nothing too fancy. Will avoid JPY crosses but think will keep cable for now since is providing a lot of good trades.

Cool, im using 1c, and only eur/usd, made 25 pips so far, and i only turned it on about 5 hours ago, very impressive for how slo the market has been.  
  
I can't see why overall this EA wont' be profitable with real money.  
I guess we'll soon find out.  
  
Maybe when we are both live we can see which settings and version produce the most live pips per pair.

Here are some demo results for FB_v1.0b (hedge version) from Aug 21.   
  
19 wins, 0 loses. Account Equity needs just $10 more to be in the black. Not bad for 1 day. On $5,000 deposit, net profit = $535 and float is ~-$650. The unknown and possible scary item is the ~30 open orders on 9 pairs. Even tough the float is reasonable now, I not sure how this will work out in the long run.

I think the float will take care of itself over time. I cannot see the float going larger than 30% of the account equity.

MOre trades will open on the 1 minute chart resulting in more pips being produced. Welcome to the forum by the way.

Really good result Wackena! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
May be we can code some procedure that prevent to open more trades if Free Margin or Margin Level is below a prefixed value depending on our broker's margin call rules.  
For example actually i'm using NortFinance as broker and it's margin call rule is to initiate to close positions opened when Margin Level % is under 10% so i'd like to code this into a little different version of Firebird but i'm not able to find a function in MT4 that returns to me that value ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
Do you know how Margin Level (%) is calculated ?

Hello.. I'm just starting with Firebird.  
I downloaded Firebird 1.0C, but compiling it gives error.  
  
[](http://img247.imageshack.us/my.php?image=compileerrorem5.gif)[http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/3...rrorem5.th.gif](http://img247.imageshack.us/img247/3132/compileerrorem5.th.gif)  
  
Did I do something wrong ?  
I'm using MT4 build 195, and I put Firebird in Expert folder.  
Please advise.  
  
Thanks in advance.

Hi Mietectec,  
look more carefull that images, it says **0 errors, 5 warnings** , so there is no errors only warnings.  
EA is working but it gives you some warnings about functions coded but not used , so nothing to worry about ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

My live account has been working fine. Yesterday my demo had trouble. There were a couple of threads yesterday about demo connection problems. The only live complaint I saw was this [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...39&postcount=6](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=87339&postcount=6)

Hi,  
I am testing Firebird from 2 days without problem, but today I' ve a problem with a comment : bad hours generated from this code :   
  
if ( Hour()<0 /*OpeningHour+GMT+DST*/ || Hour()>23 /*ClosingHour+GMT+DST*/ ) Comment("bad hours."); else { ......  
  
FXDD metatrader displays correctly the function Hours(), but the "OpeningHour+GMT+DST" is 6.  
  
I 've changed line-code manually with corret hour.  
  
Can you explain me this problem ?

giapel,  
This can be an annoyance. It does not effect trading at all. It was originally put in code to allow user to set a zone of time each day that was felt to be bad trading time and put this comment on the chart. If you do not want to use it , set OpeningHour = 0 and ClosingHour = 23.

FB v1.0a trades 24 hours per day. The first order was placed using RVI indicator and then next 2 orders would be Pipstep orders. This EA works on reverse trending. This means it almost seems to enter 1st order in wrong direction, because it makes money by placing pipstep orders as it trends in wrong direction. Then when trend reverses, the pipstep and hopefully the first order are closed with profit. So far, with present settings, this seem to be happening very consistently.

Hello everyone,  
I am new to this forum but while going through Firebird threads  
I am getting a little bit confused becouse of so many versions and test settings.  
That is why I want to ask everyone who is posting test results to include the following information:  
  
-Firebird version  
-Chart timeframe  
-Pairs used  
-Exact settings  
-File with test results  
  
This will cost you nothing but helps us all to find the information in so many posts and avoid the same questions over and over again.  
  
Thanks

Perhaps instead of asking the same questions over and over again those doing the asking should ask themselves this......is the time spent by those who are helping to turn firebird into such a promising ea better spent working to improve firebird.........or answering questions that have already been answered in the various firebird threads.  
  
If you think these fine people should spend their time doing what they do best, then read the threads through and through and do your research.  
  
Nothing in this world is free.......firebird is....so spend more time reading and answer your (previously answered) questions yourselves.

thanks RAven,  
  
The firebird world has certainly exploded in the last few days. All noobs have a duty to read through the original thread, to understand the code (it's not too complex) and look at the forward testing that has been done by Mono, Yardie, Wackena, Skyline, myself and others. Mots of your questions will be answered therein.  
  
My demo at 1 month looks like spaghetti junction now with TP and SL lines everywhere, and a float to match (5.7k), but the profits going to the bottom line are increasing daily, and firebird is really taking off with increased lots. THe USD reversal helps, but it's amazing to see how the EA has effectively auto-hedged itself and now whichever way it moves it'll take nice profits.

No problem cgldsmth i have enormous respect for you, Mono, Yardie, Wackena, Skyline and all the others that developing firebirds programing.  
  
The fact that you do all this work and post your developments for us all to use is truly amazing.  
  
As you say "The firebird world has certainly exploded in the last few days" perhaps the time is not so far away that some form of organisation of firebirds development, testing, noobs support etc is thought about.

Wackena. Thanks for sharing. The float is low. It looks like its the number of open positions which is the killer.  
  
I have just gotten rid of the slow moving pairs because of this. They just sit in float for hours and days. Now focusing on EURUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDCAD.

I agree with you yardie... i think we should code the hedge order with 10 pips trailing stop and 2 or 3 pips trailing step and a 25 pips stop loss... so the hedge orders if the hedge orders will go in the right direction (or also false) they will be closed very fast...  
  
My oppinion is to code the hedge procedere in the version 1.0c and use trailing stop for them (hedge only) how i write above and stop loss also variable for every pair (take sl from mainorder/10...) Also put the maxOpenOrders to 3 and hedge every main order, systemorder and the following pipsteporder....  
  
For counting the maxOpenOrders count only mainorders... so if you set the MaxOpenOrder to 3 there are maximum 6 orders in one piar open, 3 times mainorder and 3 hedgeorders...  
  
What do you think about... I think this way it works !!!  
  
Let´s try it...  
  
I tell it this way from the beginning but i don´t have enogh coding experience to code it...

I think we have already come to the conclusion that a 25 pips SL is too small for this EA. You seem to be suggesting that we should turn Firebird into a scalper. This may not sit well with some brokers.

Equity / Margin(used) = Margin Level  
  
IBFX liquidates you when you hit 50%  
FXDD when you hit 80%  
  
To be safe this number should be higher than 150%, imho.

Attached are modified versions of 1.0a, 1.0b & 1.0c with a new input called MinMarginLevel. Enter minimum Margin Level % where trading stops below this level. Enter percent as whole numbers; such as 100, 250, 500 & etc.  
  
I set the Margin Level equation as AccountEquity() / AccountMargin() and EA would not place orders. Journal message was divide zero. It took me a while to figure out that at the beginning AccountMargin() is 0. So, divide by zero error. I added 0.001 to AccountMargin() to get 1st trade and then the EA ran OK.

The point of this is to minimize number of open orders? Protect you from a margin call?  
  
As long as you are trading with excessive equity for the lot size, do you even need that, except as maybe a last ditch fail-safe?

Hagbard Celine,  
  
Yes, Yes and Correct.  
  
Most times, probably not needed.

I had the same problem Wackena ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I did resolve in this way :  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     // Calculate Margin Level    
    double MarginLevel()    
    { 
      double fMarginLevel=0;    
    
      if (AccountMargin() > 0) 
       { 
         fMarginLevel = ((AccountEquity()/AccountMargin())*100);
       }
    
      return(fMarginLevel);    
    }

  
Anyway good work as always Wacky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

hi, skylinedo you use the function's result "double MarginLevel()" to replace   
"extern double MinMarginLevel = 250;" ?

Hi Traders,  
  
  
I am new to the FF board, but not to Firebird. It has gone through some changes and I like what it's doing. I'm running 4 different variations of it and all are in profit. All are demo accounts.   
  
Sunday evening I started one and I'm over leveraged on it, and earlier today the margin dropped to 117%, but it climbed out of the hole and now the margin level is currently at 195%. I'm trading 10 pair. I suggest allowing $1000 per pair.  
  
So far the profit made is $2218. Equity is at $6375. I started with 7k.   
  
I think if one is careful, this script will make a lot of people very happy.   
  
The 3 other demos I'm running are much safer. I'm using the $1000 per pair rule. They are doing well, too.

ehehe Eureka, so you are broken your own rule. You have to trade 7 pairs not 10 pairs since you started an account with 7000$ ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1): ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I sure did, skyline, and I don't recommend it. It was kind of an accident. I was thinking I was trading with micro lots and it ended up trading mini lots. I should have been more careful. Glad it was a demo.

my v63G demo with 30-300-30 now at 4 weeks. Big float now but I've toned down the lot size to compensate and most of the pairs are well hedged by the EA. The TP trades are increasing everyday (about 25 closed today). If the margin gets below 200% my plan is to stop the EA to let some positions cool off. NFP is going to cause a lot of green on my screen whichever way it goes!

I noticed your lot size is constantly changing,  
Are you manually doing that, if no, how is that happening, is that automatic with the version of firebird you have?  
Oh and what timeframe are you using.

I use 63G, "Firebird 30-300" doesn't have the divergence fix, but "Ind" does.  
  
The settings are in the zip.

I began testing beginning of this week FB version 1.0a with Mono settings as indicated in first post, and on 1 min chart.  
So far 58 trades, all won, but equity is still in loss $4763 and I started with $5000.  
Monday, I had more than $1000 loss in equity when I checked it i nthe morning.  
  
Maybe, results are smoother with 30 min charts ?  
Also, my FB is heavily short on dollar, but some people here, like Mono, noticed a good hedging between different pairs.  
I wonder if there is a way to know at any moment the total exposure of the EA for each currency. If we can, we may be able perhaps to let the EA only open trades in order to reduce the exposure in the same currency.  
My apologizes if this has already been discussed before.  
  
PS: for some reason, it does not let me attach my result file

Hey folks,  
  
I just wanted to give one final update before I leave for a 25 day vacation.  
I almost don't want to go because I want to put Firebird to my live account asap ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
I'm using v63G with the default settings. The results have been amazing. Not a single loss in almost 3 weeks on 4 pairs (87-0). Float is nice and low.  
Keep up the good work while I'm away.  
  
Take care

Ind stands for Individual. Settings are configured differently for each pair.

are there any advantageous or disadvantegous to trading firebird with correlated currency pairs?  
  
USD/JPY and the EUR/USD ?  
  
USD/CHF and AUD/USD ?  
  
Trading so that there the same number of USD on left side of pair and right side of pair.  
  
thoughts?

I dont think there is any adv or disadv. What I do know is that the perfect pair is USDCHF. In the 3 months of testing, I have not had a loss with this pair (knock on wood). And it has a high turnerover rate.

No advantage, just that FXDD doen't have micro accounts. And yes $300 = 3 pairs. **

Yes, you could trade 0.3 lots on just one currency with $300.  
  
I suggest you do a bit of homework, and go though everybody's statement, before making a decision.

yeah it was more of a "what if" kind of idea.  
  
truthfully spreading the risk around in different currency pairs seems safer.  
  
i have literally looked at every posting of everyones statement and am still amazed after reading the original 70 page postings and this thread.  
  
can you explain why you are using the v63g version versus the v1.0?  
  
Thanks!

I dont want to switch EA's whilst testing is on going. (But, they should be the same).

Hello mono,  
  
I noticed that you have 2 more losses on your original 30-300 testing. Have you tried to "mentally" enter 6 lots trade with 10PIP at that time of stoploss?? I think I looked at the chart, it should be working on both instances.  
  
However I still have problem to code it into the firebird so can't put that idea into play.  
  
wish everyone has success with their firebird.

Hi mono, what is your advise before newsrelease?  
1\. Shut down the EA.  
2\. Let the EA run.  
3\. Exit all positions and run EA again after major news.  
4.....  
  
I hope you can help because you have been testing firebird for over 2 months now.

I am running tests on both brokers and the weird thing is that IBFX has better results even that the spread is higher! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)   
Maybe 2 weeks of testing doesn't give enough accuracy. But in the back of my head I am already thinking that maybe in this case, pay more spread is better. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)

Hi  
  
Ive been testing 1c out, with great results,   
One thing I noticed, the only pair it has changed the 30,300,30 settings on is euro, it changed it to 22,220,11, all other pairs, about 6 of them, all stayed on 30,300,30, as I read 1c changes this settings automatically, i figured it's a bit odd, anyone know what I might be doing wrong.  
  
I guess I could just manually change it if I wanted to.  
  
Any comments thoughts appreciated.  
  
Thanks

Well, I'm working on a Firebird EA that should handle news releases (just finding time to complete it is the problem). Ideally I would like to finish it before next weeks open so I could forward test.  
  
If its a live account and your happy where its at, shut it down before next weeks open (just in case) and restart after NFP or FORMC statement.  
  
If its a demo account then it really doesn't matter. Its just a test.

I have been testing Firebird along with you guys using various settings. Some to verify others results, some to see some new ones.  
  
I wanted to share the results I have gotten so far.  
  
This test uses Mono's individual settings (included) on the M1 chart for 9 pairs. I did mess up at first and made some trades manually in the wrong account before I engaged Firebird, but the losses were only around $30. I have removed those from the results.  
  
I also had the settings at .1 lot for the first few trades as you can see before I changed it to .05.  
  
Luckily, Firebird still impressed or I wouldn't post all of these blunders! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Close to a 50% return in only 9 days with a 142-1 ratio seems to somehow make it all better.

MOno why dont you contact Wackena via PM? Maybe he can help you put that news Firebird together. He has been making some great contributions to Firebirds development thus far.  
  
Anyhow I for one am looking forward to the news next week to see how my Firebird tests go. I want to make sure that when I go live I can leave it running with confidence. Since I am running the hedged version, it should really matter which way the market goes next week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).

Yeah, I've talked to him, and like me, he is busy at the moment, so when either of us get a chance we'll try to complete it.

For the second test, I only used the 4 majors and the original 30-300 settings. As with the other test, divergence was also fixed here.  
  
Not one to disappoint, I also goofed again near the beginning. That single trade for 1.00 lot, was made manually. I'm still in the "let's try this" phase, and wasn't really thinking about my actions were skewing my test results, I just wanted to play. I promise, I won't be so haphazard in the rest of my experiments.  
  
56 wins, no losses in 10 days. Over a 50% return. Though, according to Mono's analysis, trading 4 pairs with $3000 was too risky. Just got lucky this time.

Mono, to verify, the Firdbird Ind.zip setting you're using are the ones with pipstep set at 50% of the TP, correct?

This is very impressive for 4 pairs and the float is not only small but positive. It seems using a few pairs is the way to go to cut down on the float. My float in my test has been much better since I got rid of 5 slow moving pairs 2 days ago.

Couple of questions and thoughts.  
  
Has anyone yet tried running two indentical tests as far as settings and pairs are concerned, but allowing one to run while closing all open trades and resetting on Friday at the close on the other? I think Mono had suggested this, just not sure if he did it or not.  
  
I am going to do this with his individual settings with the 50% pipstep starting Sunday with the v63g with the fixed divergence (what is this one again now, v1.0a?). Anyone want to try it on the other settings/or versions?  
  
Also I was pondering using different lot sizes per pairs. Since the USD/CHF seems to be the most consistent winner, would it not make sense to increase the lot size? That would seem to me to make it more profitable while not negatively affecting the float or adding substantially to the risk. I plan to go back and check through the trades, but am I off in my logic here? I know you could do the same thing with the more winning pairs, but you'd be increasing the risk more too.   
  
I'm just wondering since optimizing the TP-SL-Pipstep for each pair was so effective, if doing the same for the lot sizes might be too.

A few people are. Read further into this and the other firebird threads. It was discussed a few days ago. They are using IBFX.

It's official, i'm no longer going to "Lurk" around the FB threads...  
  
I have read nearly every post and i'm impressed by the comradery (well what did i expect...this is FF !) and wanted to thank the FB thread-posting kings on a terrific job of maintaining a cool, calm, patient attitude toward the gazillion questions.  
  
I've read, reread, and read some more and will open a IBFX Demo account over the weekend and begin forward testing (haha. still haven't decided which of the EA versions to test, but i've got the weekend to dig some more and decide.) My goal is to forward demo test the month of September and then open a small $500-$1000 account at IBFX to trade micro-lots for use in October and beyond. This will actually be refreshing as my other live account is with a different broker (non MT4 platform) so i'll feel like i'm not placing all my eggs in one basket : )  
  
Thank you again one and all.  
Cheers,  
Thom

THeres only ONE BIG problem i find with the firebird EA. It overtrades. And when i say overtrade i mean it opens pointless positions based on nothing. IT has many winners, but the floating stuff is ridiculous. It will probably end up positive but really, to keep a realistic stop loss on this program you would get burnt so quick. I am going off someones recommendation of 120 pip stop loss. Now if i was to lose that trade, the win to loss is 6:1. Meaning 6 wins = 1 loss. Now its easy to keep this, but i mean 3 losses in a row = 18 wins. Which is pretty much al the profit. Seems to be a break even strategy to me.

Hi Skyline, you might have this above issue resolved by now? But if not, i believe the moderator of this area in FF can fix that 24 hr-max-edit and can get you into that to make changes. One solution i've found for such situations on my own server is to simply have the link point to a folder on my domain. If you don't have access to such, i am more than happy to have the Firebird files located on my server (i've got unlimited space) in a folder that any can have access to. That way the link would remain constant, but the data within the folder could be updated at will no problem.  
  
I've created a folder in my "FX-Mirror" area at my domain called "mt4-firebird" to house the files. I will promptly remove this from my server if this is a problem. The files are the original ones posted recently and are current. Let me know if this is ok. The link to place in a post to the mirrored Firebird files would be as follows:  
  
<http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/>  
  
inside are the Firebird Ind.zip, and Firebird v1 a, b, and c files  
  
If this is convenient, all one would need to do is to send the files to me via email in my contact link and i'll put it right in the directory usually within moments of getting it if between the hours of 6am PT and 2pm PT Monday through Friday, and at random times during the weekend. Obviously the files uploaded to this directory would only be "official" firebird files...only from the creators/maintainers such as yourself, mono, whacky etc,..you guys could give me a list of "ok to post from" nics and we would all be on the same page.  
  
One other thought as a PS. Other Firebird related documents could be in there also and organized in subdirectories such as trade results, how to set up docs and other stuff...it is up to you guys what you would want in there. Like i said, i've got unlimited space to load it up! It is just a tool...and a nice tax write off. hehe.  
  
Just here to help : )

I'm been using FB 63G for nearly a month on two real accounts. For example; For the past two weeks, 39 wins, No losses [to date] and the Open Trades are now down to $39 on 5 pairs with Mono settings [without Cable!!]. I have stopped the EA now because Fed Chairman Bernanke Speaks…  
  
Very pleased with the profit and all the help given on the FB threads.

A solution for this as already been presented. Change the PIPLOss setting to a higher number than 500...like 50000 or something. There was also a solution on how to remove the code from the EA itself.

yes, i´ve been using it on the latest news and have work fine. it opens 2 positions, with 2 sl. you should only put the time of the news according to you mt server, the day of the news from 1-5 and thats all 

Have a good day and a good trade!

Is this a co-incidence or what?.....Someone above is sending us signals.  
  
Ok, this is what i'm upto.  
  
We know that Firebird works great 90% of the time, but it needs assistance during trying times. (For the purpose of this explanation I'll call Firebird "Mr Firebird"). And in saying that I've got in the works, "Mrs Firebird".  
  
Lets assume we are looking at GBPUSD with the following settings.  
  
TP = 30  
SL = 300  
PIPSTEP = 15  
  
Mrs Firebird see's what Mr Firebird is doing and protects and cleans up after him.   
Basically she straddles him....(no pun intended)... when the price has moved TP in the opposite direction. As the price moves further away, she moves her SL to BE+1(no point in walking away with nothing).   
  
When Mr Firebird gets Stopped out, her SL moves to where he got stopped and her TP will move to price +/- 30.  
  
I hope your following me so far.  
  
So I'm looking at running 2 EA's on 1 Account.  
  
Also Mrs Firebird will be able to place BUY/SELL STOPS before news where MR Firebird is in a losing position.  
e.g. before news GBPUSD trade is at -250 pips. So Mrs Firebird places BUY/SELL STOPS at his -300 with tight trailstop.  
  
Any thoughts?

Mono,  
  
This concept sounds interesting. So what you would do would be to open up a 2nd chart (using your example of GBP/USD) and attach the 2nd EA to this chart within the same account. Am I correct? So this would essentially counter any negative effect/loss in the Mr. Firebird EA. Would this just counter the loss in Mr. Firebird or would there actually be a profit in Mrs. Firebird? By the way, thanks for all your hard work you as well as the others have done on Firebird. The concept and its continuing evolution is amazing!

What about Mr and Mrs Firebird EA (i.e version b?). It has hedge built in and so far I am getting the same results as you are getting on your Mr. Firebird with custom settings. Adding to this I am using only 6 pairs instead of the 11 I had before. Float since I launch the EA on the 22nd is about -1000 pips.

Hello mono (and all),  
  
  
OK i've just set up the firebird EA, and 3 trades are already open. I just want to be sure i've done it all correctly.  
  
How do i know that it is trading off of the 1M chart? (I attached it to the 1M each time i added a currency pair), but how do i confirm this?  
  
Thank you.

Hi,  
  
So if i change the timeframe of the chart i'm looking at, that will automatically change the timeframe of the chart it trades off of?

You would only need hedging on Mr Firebird, cause Mrs Firebird would cover for you.

So while Mr. Hedge Firebird is opening up trades in both directions at the same time, Mrs. Firebird will be opening even more trades?

No.... Mrs Firebird would only open up a trade when your Hedge order has opened and is in the negetive by a certain margin.

To run 2 EAs on the same pair do we need a user entered magic number? I don't know but over on TSD Newdigital says it is important so the EAs can keep track of orders.

mono,  
how do the pip steps come into play on this? do you do the same thing to each pipstep as well?

Your standard firebird (Mr Firebird) does the pipsteps, Mrs Firebird is just protection for excessive losses, with a bit of news trading on the side.

Mrs Firebird is still conceptual. Right now Mr Firebird remains a bachelor, but he's looking for his perfect match, yin to his yang. (And mono and others are thinking of coding her into existence for him).

Any current firebird version is being refered by me as Mr Firebird.  
  
Mrs Firebird is being developed.

The short answer to your question is yes. If you switch from 1 minute to 30 minute then Firebird will execute based on the signals on the 30 minute charts.

Maybe you should write ".... x pairs simultaniously...."  
You can monitor many pairs and only open trades in x pairs at the same time. That way you can trade with a small account but still get many signals. 

May the pips be with you.

i think the other settings which are used are this one of mono in the first post(which are different for every currency pair)  
  
i have run both settings on demo and it seems that the settings of mono (which are different for every currency) are making faster pips but they have also alot of float more.

Before today's news and after almost one week testing, my equity is just $ 4200 ($800 loss) and I am trading 6 pairs. Balance is $6880. Am I the only one that has such losses this week for those who started testing these last days ?

Hi kingforex,  
  
I have switched off my the E/A on my live account, but I thought I would run a demo thru' Fri/Saturday.   
  
In 7 hours this has chalked up 1 win for $32 [GB/Yen] and the Float is a positive $490 [in credit]!!

Is it hard loss or flaoting loss? If its floating then its normal. You didnt say how much you started with. but I suspect you would still be ahead even with $800 floating since your balance has grown.

Good work Mono, Yardie and everbody else here. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
Thanks TraderSeven for such an interresting EA.  
  
I went live using mini this week using 30-300-25.  
Using 5 pairs EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD and USDJPY.  
Added another pair GBPUSD yesterday.  
Floating loss is hugh. Don't know if pipstep is the guilty one.  
Can't think of something else because almost everybody here are doing just fine. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)   
Can the pipsettings make such a big difference?  
Or maybe I have chosen the wrong time to start...... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)   
  
I hope next week will turn this thing around.  
  
Have a nice weekend everybody and don't forget to GET THOSE PIPS!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

First of all as long as it takes to be sure it's bugfree.  
Secondly until you have seen all market conditions.  
Firebird loves sideways action. Success is almost guaranteed on such markets.   
When I tested on D1 things worked fine for 6 months.  
Then... one wrong trend....  
Bye bye 6 months profits.  
  
Shorter timeframes probably means shorter testing time; but the fact remains you have to withness all markets. With the same version.  
Coders can make mistakes too. When the hedging should start Firebird doesn't hedge but buys 100 lots in the wrong direction.  
  
If it looks like the Holy Grail it probebly isn't.... 

May the pips be with you.

Hi Yardie,  
My balance has grown from $5000 to $6882, but my floating loss is $2575. Therefore, my net loss (deposit minus equity) is $800. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)   
And I am running FB 1.0a on 1 Min chart, with Mono's settings (as indicated in first post).  
And if USD goes up later today, I guess I'd have many stop losses triggered...

anyone else getting loaded down by USDCAD? My float is massive now and I've halted any more trades hoping to let it settle. This may be one of those times that trades should all be closed, but I'm reluctant to turn a 15k profit into a 5k one.

Hi Humax,  
I also started this week (hopefully on demo...) and I have the same kind of results (please see my statement above). Thanks to report it, so people would be more careful if they want to go live.

I am loaded down by every pair I trade. Floating loss just keeps building up.  
Let us hope that next weeks newsrelease can turn the floating loss into winners. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f620.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f94a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f620.png?v=15.1)

It's a matter of view if floating loss/profits are real losses/profits.  
If things turn in your favor you will win big with so many lots.  
Afterall your other trades turnmed out fine too. And they didn't start winning right away either.  
  
Especially USDJPY looks bad.  
A little wider envelopes gives a more stable portfolio. And less trades...  
You could also lower ProfitTarget a bit. But settings ultimately depend on your own personality. Your money, your risk, your settings....  
  
A simple riskcontrol that the coders could add is stop adding other pairs if for example there already 2 pairs trading.  
Or if you already averaged 4 times over all positions. 

May the pips be with you.

I'm happy you guys are having a bad time!  
Not that I want to be sadistic but it's good you experience the risk of Firebird with your own eyes on a demo account.  
  
But now you know what to fix.  
Backtest the same period and see if it looks like the forward test.  
Print/keep the results.  
Now start working on a fix until this bad period can softened to acceptable levels.  
Maybe you just have to accept 30% drawdowns when trading Firebird.  
It's the longer term performance that counts.... 

May the pips be with you.

No problems here TraderSeven. I have experienced drawdowns of 50% using my own strategy. I am hanging in there. ( or could be hanged.....)  
As we all know, trending market is very very bad for firebird.  
Now just hope the market will retrace for us to profit. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

I know this drives you crazy and stops the EA from trading.  
What I did is, click to modify the EA and use find "excessive" and delete the whole line!  
Never "EXCESSIVE LOSS!" for me anymore. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Find below in the code  
  
if ( !(IsTesting() || IsDemo()) ) { if (LossCheck()) { Alert("excessive loss!"); PlaySound("alert.wav"); return(0); }} // included by Renato  
  
And comment it out with //.  
  
After you compile all your settings will be reset, so you will need to re-apply them.

Thanks TraderSeven for your response and this EA, as well to all the other programmers and testers. Your assistance and generosity is incredible, and truely appreciated.  
  
I am running 1a on a demo, and have been running about 7 hours now. Of the two closed GBPUSD trades, the first is for 30 pips, the second for 22.   
  
When I check the expert properties the sets for GBPUSD have been changed.  
  
How were they changed?   
  
I used Mono's settings originally. Now ALL currencies have been changed to the following sets: 22/220/11  
  
How?   
What happened?  
  
Any ideas?  
  
Thanks,

Replace  
  
if ( !(IsTesting() || IsDemo()) ) { if (LossCheck()) { Alert("excessive loss!"); PlaySound("alert.wav"); return(0); }} // included by Renato  
  
With  
//if ( !(IsTesting() || IsDemo()) ) { if (LossCheck()) { Alert("excessive loss!"); PlaySound("alert.wav"); return(0); }} // included by Renato

How did firebird 1a change the settings for all pairs by itself? Was originally using the MONO sets, now after about 7 hours of runtime all pairs are 22/200/11

There is no perfect software, even MT4 has bugs. I had simmilar case with another expert. In my case it messed up default settings with settings from *.set file. After I reset them again to settings from *.set file it showed all correct settings, but some of them it still took from default settings, like Lot size was from default settings.  
Please try to keep your MT4 up to date.  
This thing happened to me after I run optimization for several days.

You can't fix it. Try to restart it from time-to-time. I have noticed that after few hours of optimization process, its performance goes down significantly, after restart it comes back to normal. Try to do not push on it too much :-) and it will run smoothly.

No, I meant shutdown MT4 and start it up again.  
Do not close positions.

I believe this happenes very rare, because only you and me noticed that. If you run expert on real account, I would restart it at least once a week during weekend.

Hi all, so after reading the original and this new FB thread plus some of the others linked to other forum sites i downloaded and tested the version v1c beginning Thursday evening at ~Midnight Pacific Time and closed the only remaining two trades out Friday at ~8am that had been initiated early on by the hedge version which i accidentaly got on duplicate charts. Only the EURUSD and USDCHF on 1m charts were traded. ([see this link for statement](http://www.accrete.com/fx-posts/eafb-statements/2006-08-25v01c-Statement.htm)). The only thing i changed was the 30m to 1m in the MA settings.  
  
All in all these were the least "painful" 119 pips i've ever gotten on a demo account in 8 hours time even with the one loss on the hedge EA of -33 pips on the Swissy. So next Sunday will begin my demo in ernest and see if this will suit my personality.   
  
Have a good weekend all.  
: ) Thom

hi accrete,  
  
i dont think you have to change the ma setting. it should be left at 30, even on the 1m chart.  
  
anyone please correct me if i'm wrong.

Kingforex. Euro would have to go up over 1.3000 to have any SL triggered. I think over time your net profit will increase and back into the positive. Sounds to me that the EA is working as it should.

I've noticed that several people are getting similar yet different results from F.B. This difference at times may be attributed to the pipstep value. Can someone tell me what this pipstep value represents and what its function is with respect to Firebird?  
  
Thanks,

Pipstep is the value where a new order is opened if the trade is going against you. So if you have a pipster of 20 and the trade goes in the negative by 20 pips a new trade is open in the same direction.

When Firebird takes a position it assumes that the 'trend' reverses very soon.  
If it doesn't retrace with in PipStep pips then add another lot and average the position. When the position is averaged this way there is a higher probabilty that the ProfitTarget is met.  
  
So PipStep controls how soon/often a position is averaged.  
To small is your position grows very quickly.  
To small it averages to slow and reduces your chances. 

May the pips be with you.

My profit and my floating loss is the exact same number. The fact that it can open so many wrong positions at once is very upsetting.

Yardie/T7,  
  
Thanks for clarifying Pipstep for me. So should I assume that the larger the pipstep value, the more likely it is to hit without taking too many trades?   
  
I noticed one script taking a pipstep value equal to one half (1/2) of the T/P value. I've been running that value for the past week with good results but the number of open trades has been significant. Over 40.

After my 2<SUP>nd</SUP> week of live trading Firebird – here are some of my experiences and thoughts…. I hope they are helpful.  
  
My Experience:  
Last week – intervened in about ½ of the trades (closing early profit to keep my gearing light – I was too aggressive on the contract sizes). Generated approx. 250% return. However, after reviewing the charts last weekend and the USD retraction market open this week, I quickly realized that I could have cleared around 350% - if not higher.  
This week – (started 2<SUP>nd</SUP> trading day… I was licking my wounds the first night after realizing I was too hasty the week before) Lowered my gearing by half of a lot size. I added 4 lower range pairs for a total of 10 – with specific inputs per each pair. Firebird was activated for 2<SUP>nd</SUP> session of <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace w:st="on">Japan</st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace></st1:country-region> and left untouched (for the most part – I do generally shut down for news) till today NY close.  
  
<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
My Thoughts:  
The results for this week have been stagnant –apparently across the board. What I mean is, based on what I’m reading from everybody’s results, my foreword demo from last week and my live account – is that I find a consistency. Float loss and gain equilibrium.  
I believe this week was not a good one for Firebird due to the smooth momentum of market action (no crazy retracting spikes to capitalize on). It also appears that regardless of the different settings everyone is using the results are the same. Float and booked profits are proportional.  
  
If anyone here has experienced anything different this week, I encourage you to share. This way we can develop a better ideology towards Firebird.

If it was that simple I would set it to 9999. And then remove it completly... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Example:  
1] PipStep=30, ProfitTarget=30  
2] Enter Short at 1.0000  
3] Price moves up to 1.0030 -> add an extra lot  
4] Average price is now 1.0015  
5] Price goes to 0.9975 and then goes up to 1.2222  
6] That price passes 0.9985 (1.0015-0.0030) so there we grab profits.  
  
  
1] PipStep=50, ProfitTarget=30  
2] Enter Short at 1.0000  
3] Price moves up to 1.0030 -> no 50 pips so no averaging  
5] Price goes to 0.9975 and then goes up to 1.2222  
6] We need 1.0000-0.0030=0.9970  
7] No we are in big trouble because the trend goes up to 1.2222. A heavy drawdown 

May the pips be with you.

Hi all!  
  
I would need your help please i am running firebird live now on my mini account on IBFX. Everything seems to work good but there are no pipsteppositions opened on Yenpairs. I use version 1.A but changed the settings to monos settings (TP and SL) but with an higher pipstep. Others pairs open the mainorder and pipsteporder, but unfortunately YEN pairs dont. ANY ideas???  
  
Thanks for your help!!!!

TraderSeven,  
  
  
I get your point in that one has to find an equilibrium as there may be no perfect setting given changing market conditions. Guess I'm just trying to figure out how to keep the number of open trades down yet keep enough trades coming through intraday to keep the pips flowing. I know I can set the max number of trades to less than 10 which is the default but then I risk being locked out from additional trades while waiting for the earlier trades to hit.

Think carefully before you make a wish ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
**_For a 5 digit yearly income you have to work hard, for a 6 digit income you simply need an idea..._**   
  
The current EURUSD quote: 1.2754  
That's also 5 digits. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):   
  
  
_I use version 1.A but changed the settings to monos settings (TP and SL) but with an higher pipstep._  
  
If you set PipStep to high the price never reaches it. So no averaging takes place. 

May the pips be with you.

Alan,  
  
  
  
What's best I can't tell you. But you understand you have to find an  
  
equilibrium. So you know what to work toward.  
  
  
  
Take a look at:  
  
extern double IncreasementType =0;//0=just add every PipStep, >0 =OrdersToal()^x *Pipstep  
  
You can use that input to create variable PipSteps.  
  
Look in the Firebird document for more details but decreasing PipStep  
  
may help your cause.  
  
  
  
I don't have the same mind set as many here. I wouldn't even considered  
  
M1. For me preserving capital is the #1 aim.  
  
Some risk controlling things the coder may consider.  
  
  

  1. Run Firebird on 10 pairs but allow only 2/3 pairs to be trading simultaneously.  
  
  

  2. Use uncorrelated pairs. 

  1. [_http://www.mataf.net/en/analysis-correlation.htm_](http://www.mataf.net/en/analysis-correlation.htm)  
  
  

  2. When a pair average for the 3rd time set max open pairs to 1 and TakeProfit to zero  
  
  

  3. Waiting for a trade to go your way can cost money to. Say you earn $100/day. But you refuse to take $300 losing trade and wait 10 days to exit with a $100 profit. That trade earned you $100, but kept you out of 9 trades worth $900. So you 'lost' $900. My point is that admitting defeat _might_ be better.  

  
  
It's better to make 50% a month with little drawdown than 100% with more risk. Look at it with compounding.  
  
If you make a nice percentage your account quickly doubles with means faster profits etc.  
  
An added bonus you can sleep at night instead of worrying about DD.  
  
  
  
  
  
  

May the pips be with you.

TraderSeven,  
  
Was .27 the last version of the Firebird document you published? Have you seen a document anywhere on Firebird ver. 65?

Yes.  
  
But v0.27 of the document is also for Firebird v0.65  
The numbering of the document has nothing to do with the versions of the EA.  
  
All Firebirds have been the same.  
Most versions are just debugging, reming typing errors, cleaning code etc.  
So the logic never changed so the document is still valid up to Firebird v0.65  
But not for the versions >0.65 and all versions with a letter.  
None of them are mine. 

May the pips be with you.

Thanks, I am going to post a PDF of ver.27 in this thread. I think it would at least answer some of the questions about settings.

Trader 7,  
  
  
Thanks for the information. Yes I have noticed most are trading in 1M TF which I with other systems would have a higher statistical probably of success in higher TFs. In the case of Firebird, perhaps 5 or 15 min TF might help to reduce the number of open positions along with a 'reasonable' pipstep. Regarding MONO's setting, I've read nearly all of the Firebird posting but I think I missed his personal settings.

good evening folks  
  
i have attached the statements of all my demos which i run for ~2days.  
the normal firebird versions started i with 7 pairs and added the AUD/USD yesterday and the GBP/JPY today. the 1.0a with the settings of Mono are using 10pairs.  
  
the 1.0b, 1.0c and 1.0a Mono settings are the most proftable till now but they have also a lot of float more

I think I like v0.63 results best.  
  
v0.63: 522.29 profit / 138.84 float= 3.76  
v1.0c: 1 354.24 /1 472.16 float = 0.92  
  
Over simplified it means v0.63 is 4x safer.  
Change 0.1 in v0.63 to 0.25 lots and profits are about the same as v1.0c  
With a float of only $360 

May the pips be with you.

Trader7,  
  
  
Thanks great information you just provided regarding the profit factor comparison between V.063 and 1(c). I've been running vers 1(c) this week and while I've been impressed with the equity line (using the default settings), the float has been comparatively high. The .92 PF you posted sounds about right. I'll take a look at the setting you provide for vers. (G). I would consider going live in the next few weeks if I can determine the right combination of settings with a high enough confidence factor to trade on.  
  
**Added comment:** what is the length of time your PF values are based on? I understood earlier your comment about compounding and I'm fully on board with its impact. Do you prefer periods greater than 1 minute yet longer than 1H?  
  
Alan

After 4 weeks Firebird Ind has booked 13614 pips  
  
Win/Loss is 766/10  
  
And float is @ -$5800.  
  
Its really loaded up, so I'm looking forward to a 200 pip spike next week, to clear the float, one way or another.

I took the numbers from ART 1 a few posts above.  
Diffrent settings diffrent results. But it was just meant as a rough estimate.  
  
About the timeframes I can't really comment. I mostly used D1 but more recently I'm looking at M30. Never looked lower.   
Other timeframes, other problems I fear... 

May the pips be with you.

Great testing Mono. I'm not so happy with the float (but that's personal) but the overal results are promissing.  
  
If this is real life performance that last over long periods of time we have a very reasoneble EA I think. 

May the pips be with you.

Go to the first post of this thread. There you'll find the differences between the versions. 

May the pips be with you.

Firebird 30-300 has 1 setting for all pairs and the EA **has not** got the divergence fix, which affects the jappy pairs.  
  
Firebird Ind has individual settings for each pair, and the EA **has** the divergence fix.

Yeah, float is high. I think you'll find Firebird works best if you switch on after NFP or FORMC statement and let it run for 2 - 2.5 weeks, then switch off, closing all positions.

Why after news and not before?  
During news is risky. But before news the market can get nervous creates some nice spikes. It depends on the news impact but what about switching it of 2-3 hours before and after the news.  
US news affects USD crosses more than crosses without USD.  
So complete shutdown might be overkill. 

May the pips be with you.

Your losses are not created by the news, because divergence on the 1min chart keeps you out. The losing trades are the one opened a week before the news. The news just helps push them over the edge.

Hi all!  
  
I would need your help please i am running firebird live now on my mini account on IBFX. Everything seems to work good but there are no pipsteppositions opened on Yenpairs. I use version 1.A but changed the settings to monos settings (TP and SL) but with an higher pipstep. Others pairs open the mainorder and pipsteporder, but unfortunately YEN pairs dont. ANY ideas???  
  
Thanks for your help!!!!

If you were trading version b of Firebird you would have had profits this week. I booked 2580 the past 3 days and my float is about -1500 pips. I am trading 6 pairs EURUSD, USDJPY, EURJPY, GBPUSD, USDCHF and USDCAD. PIPstep, SL etc is same at Mono's original 30-300-30.

> After my 2<SUP>nd</SUP> week of live trading Firebird – here are some of my experiences and thoughts…. I hope they are helpful.  
>    
>  My Experience:  
>  Last week – intervened in about ½ of the trades (closing early profit to keep my gearing light – I was too aggressive on the contract sizes). Generated approx. 250% return. However, after reviewing the charts last weekend and the USD retraction market open this week, I quickly realized that I could have cleared around 350% - if not higher.  
>  This week – (started 2<SUP>nd</SUP> trading day… I was licking my wounds the first night after realizing I was too hasty the week before) Lowered my gearing by half of a lot size. I added 4 lower range pairs for a total of 10 – with specific inputs per each pair. Firebird was activated for 2<SUP>nd</SUP> session of <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace w:st="on">Japan</st1![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)lace></st1:country-region> and left untouched (for the most part – I do generally shut down for news) till today NY close.

>  My Thoughts:  
>  The results for this week have been stagnant –apparently across the board. What I mean is, based on what I’m reading from everybody’s results, my foreword demo from last week and my live account – is that I find a consistency. Float loss and gain equilibrium.  
>  I believe this week was not a good one for Firebird due to the smooth momentum of market action (no crazy retracting spikes to capitalize on). It also appears that regardless of the different settings everyone is using the results are the same. Float and booked profits are proportional.  
>    
>  If anyone here has experienced anything different this week, I encourage you to share. This way we can develop a better ideology towards Firebird.

Looks good. I think overtime Firebird 1.0b will be the winner of all the other versions. How can you lose with positions being opened in both direction? It should shine even in strong trends.

Hi Mono,  
  
The 63G file you attached to the results for the IND version, it has the divergence fix?  
  
The code looks identical to the 63G file you attached to the 30/300 version.  
  
Please advise.  
  
regards,  
forexpips

This is the Firebird document v0.27. This PDF file is the same as the HTML file posted in other threads. It was not written for the newer versions of Firebird but it explains some of the Firebird settings now in use. In this thread there are a lot of posts where people share what values they are using for the current versions of Firebird posted here. I think Mono probably has the most widely followed settings. This document helped me gain a better understanding of Firebird even though some parts do not apply directly to the Firebird versions in this thread.

Yardie,   
  
Thanks for the heads-up. I'm checking into ART1's statements as well. You guys don't have the full week (which might be skewing the results). What I am in the process of doing now is going through different results from different versions to get their float to gain ratios.  
  
Gain/Float (loss) = Ratio (1= equilibrium - any value above 1 is good and below...well you get the idea)  
  
So far from ART1's results (thanks ART1)   
V.A = 2.4  
V.B = 1.5  
V.C = .9  
63g _ TS =3.7  
63g (mono 6 pair set) = .9  
  
So my next obvious question would be...can someone post a functioning version of Firebird TS please?  
  
Thanks in advance.

Thanks forexpips and Yardie for the reply, though i've read through the original thread and this one i'm a serrious newbie when it comes to EAs! In my reading i had gathered the perception that matching the MA info up w/the chart's time frame was normal practice...my bad. But i'm suprised i'm doing so well mentally at this point after reading hundreds of posts in the last day and a half. haha. (oh yea, and all of the Phoenix thread! my eyes need a rest)  
  
Having fun learning and taking it all in. Will begin a forward test in at least a couple new demos this Sunday. Not yet sure of the versions or settings i'll run. More re-reading to do before then.

Hi,  
Thanks for great work by Wackena and others. In Post 91, Wackena mentioned a bug in version b as

> I've noticed that Firebird v1.0b is only placing hedge orders on initial sells, but not on buys. I will look at code today to try to find out why.

This seems not fixed in the newer version b. In this version b, hedge orders will still only be placed on initial sells. The bug is, in the code, the value of variable ret will never be 2 before "Go SHORT". so it will never place the hedge buy order for initial sells. I tried to use another two if statements after open initial orders (including sells and buys) before the return, the issue seems gone.  
  
Perhaps, Wackena already found the bug and fixed it.   
  
Thanks!

I tested Firebird v1.0b (settings: variable) and v1.0c (setting: 30-300) for a full week. I used M15 timeframe on the four majors only. Lot size: 0.1.  
  
Firebird 1.0b showed the better performance: 44 trades, all were winners. There is an xls file attached to this post with breakdown of the trades by currency pairs etc.   
  
The floating value is higher than I would like it to be. Almost 63% of the float in value has been given by USDJPY, this pair was trended up steadily last week. The period of one week is too short to draw deeper inference, though USDJPY seems to be the pair that most should improve its trading efficiency.  
  
I suspend Firebird 1.0c test from next week because of its poorer performance. Instead of that I am about to start a test with Firebird 1.0b on a mini account using M1 timeframe.

Hi all!  
  
I would need your help please i am running firebird live now on my mini account on IBFX. Everything seems to work good but there are no pipsteppositions opened on Yenpairs. I use version 1.A but changed the settings to monos settings (TP and SL) but with an higher pipstep. Others pairs open the mainorder and pipsteporder, but unfortunately YEN pairs dont. ANY ideas???  
  
Thanks for your help!!!!

I think what is being missed here in the ongoing discussions is what was posted earlier with ART 1 and someone else the results regarding Firebird V63g-TS (28,560 bytes).  
  
As stated this EA prior to the others has a gain float ratio of 3.7 as discussed below this is critical on a live account say of $5,000 because it may avoid 3 times as many open postions, I don't know if this EA is better than 1b, however it appears based on limited thus far foward testing that this may be the best EA of all the Firebird's Posted, any comments would be welcome. I don't know what causes this excellent gain to ratio basis, but this should be discussed more fully in the forum.  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------  
process of doing now is going through different results from different versions to get their float to gain ratios.  
  
Gain/Float (loss) = Ratio (1= equilibrium - any value above 1 is good and below...well you get the idea)  
  
So far from ART1's results (thanks ART1)   
V.A = 2.4  
V.B = 1.5  
V.C = .9  
63g _ TS =3.7  
63g (mono 6 pair set) = .9  
  
So my next obvious question would be...can someone post a functioning version of Firebird TS please?

For me the key is the booked pips and account growth...and MOno has proved that 63G with custom settings grows faster even with the ratio thingie you are talking about. Besides a few days of testing aby ART is not enough to come to a definitive conclusion.

Yardie I completely agree, will test this 24/7 next week using the Firebird IB and the Firebird V-63G-TS and post the results using the 30-300-30 settings, I think Float is important due to Margin requirements, as some of the guy's I would assume may be opening live accounts with less money that is needed to for success. Moneybags who ran (4) curriencies as discussed in this thread used V-63G-TS from August 7-23 (three weeks) had profit closed of $2,307 and at this point Float was $102.37 (EURUSD, USDCHF,USFCAD,AUDUSD). Skyline who ran with the 30 minute chart claimed total pips of 1,066 with Maximum float drawdown of about $300 as posted earlier. This still may have no merit, but will check it out anyway

You can have less float by using higher time fram charts etc... But you wins are lower and if your trades go against you with the 300 pip stop loss your gains could be wiped out in no time. Still it will be interesting to see how the different settings work over time.

Hello Firebirders,  
  
I have finally read all the posts in all the forums for Firebird and Phoenix. Let me say Fantastic work on the EA's. I have loaded and installed FB 63G and Mono's C variation. I only let the C version run for a few days and it booked quite a few pips.  
  
On reading all the treads, I noticed that one of the big worries is trading on News days. I know that The set up is on the 1 min chart with the MA of 30. It caught my notice that several people avoided the losses on the news were on the 30 min charts. What would the ramifications be if you switched to the 30min form the 1 min on the news day then back. I am not a coder and since I have other obligations for my time that I can not spend a lot of time on back testing, so please accept this humble observation and idea. I hope it has merit.

I think Mono explained somewhere that the news isn't what causes the problem, it's the open positions. They could be a week, two weeks old or more. You can't get rid of this without destroying profitability and probably the probability of it even working. It's inherent to the function of Firbird. It could probably just as easily go for you as against you, so I see no reason to change it during the news. Is there something I'm missing?  
  
You have to be willing to accept drawdowns in any system, but even more so in an entirely mechanical automated system. These drawdowns really only seem to signal "Profit!, Straight ahead!" to me. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) I think in the other thread someone described how to envision Firebird as something that takes advantage of the markets tendency to return to average, - like a stretched rubber band - the further off it is, the harder it will snap back. And snag profit along the way.  
  
Just to clarify Labrat, I'm not neccessarily directly addressing you, but the situation in general. Just don't want to come off preachy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

We have seen enough success from Firebird in several incarnations to warrent conducting some more standardized testing.  
  
We need to come up with all the different combinations of versions and settings that have been successful already, and those we deduce may be even more profitable still.  
  
We need to get people that can allow the EA to run untouched, 24 hrs a day from market open to close. After the variables are agreed to this pool of testers will be assigned a few (how ever many that they can handle, though will probably want to try and keep this number as low as possible, depends on the number of participants) differents combinations. Using the same setups accross different providers would also be neccessary as well. Hopefully there will be alot of volunteers who meet the criteria.  
  
The difficult thing is getting this organized quickly. We need to start them all at the same time. Considering the market open in less than 24 hrs, it will be challenge to accomplish it this week, but if not, we'll have to wait another week.  
  
Who's game?

I am using 63G - ie. the non-fixed version and have no problems with the pip step. Have you set the EA timeframe to 30min and the charts to 1min. For some reson the pipstep has problems if the chart is 30 min rather than 1 min.  
  
USD/JPY has indeed been the worst performer for the last few weeks.

A lot of my best trading days have been news days where the market spikes. My main concern is with the open positions. I think mono and some others have mentioned this also. Once the EA has been running for about a month, then you start hitting the 300 pip stop loss. It may be wise to close all positions every few weeks to avoid this problem. This is a challenge also because some of those floating losses actually end up profitable. So as yet I am not sure how I will handle this problem. My account is up 39% in 3 weeks with a 15% floating loss at this stage. So, do I close now or wait. What is needed is consistency and discipline. That is the difficult part. If I closed now I would lose 15%, but still be up 24%. If I let it run I will get more pips but risk losing more also. So it's a bit of a dillema.

I can't tell you which one is best. I am using the original 63g and doing well. I have only been testing 1b for a week so do not know how that will compare.

Thanks TraderSeven - I hope I get the zip-thing right now!  
  
Attached is Firebird 63G 1 minute chart with mono specific setting for each 5 pair majors. (Eur, CAD, CHF, JPY, AUD) Started with $5000 to test $1000 for each pair.  
  
The account ran for 5 days with no loss BUT...  
  
The free margin went into negative - now on -$567.21. That means margin call on a live account.  
  
FB 63G was started on 22nd and looks vwery positive - woll post next weekend. 63TS also positive, although a little less than 63G.

The one that Wackena posted last week does both.

The problem with organizing this is that people tend to test the same settings that others are havign success with (such as Mono's settings). No one wants to do their own experiments. I am not sure why people would want to demo the same settings that is already being demoed by someone else anyway.

Finally had time to review Firebird v1.0b1 to correct reason why EA was only placing hedge order on main sell orders. Attached is FB v1.0b2. This EA will placed 1 hedge order for each Buy or Sell main orders. Also to control number of open orders, this EA has input OpenOrders. This sets the number of main orders opened for each chart. Eaxmple if = 2, max open orders will range 0-4. If = 3, range will be 0-6 max open orders.

I don't think that having people using the same setttings is a bad thing, it provides confirmation of the earlier success and through a different time frame (it was started at a different period) with possibly a different broker.   
  
I was trying to draw up something last night to detail all the different version and combinations we need to test, but realize there is no way to finish it in time for this week. We'll need to get it all done through this week to be ready for the next market open.  
  
If everyone can help me come up with the different setups we need, I'll be glad to organize it into a list/spreadsheet to dole out to all the participants.  
  
I think we have 4 different versions at this point, 63G -TS, 1.0a, 1.0b, and 1.0c, correct?  
  
We'll need to test each with the 4 majors, top 6, top 8, and then 10. (Maybe even odd numbers if we have enough people testing, but this might be a little overkill).  
  
Then we need to come up with the variables worth testing that are applicable accross all of the versions.  
  
We need to set up variables that are specific to each version, I know that on 1.0b for example it needs to be tested with different variables to enter the hedge on. Right now I think it's at 5 pip retrace.   
  
Then we need to have two of every combination we come up with to have one set that will reset every week and one that will be allowed to run.  
  
I'm sure there's a lot I'm not even thinking about. This may take longer than week. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
I just need help coming up with the variables to test, then I'll draw up a chart and track everyones assignments and performance.

Here are the results from one of the tests I'm running. This is v63G with Div. fixed run for more than 7 trading days. I run it on the 5 minute chart with TP=42 SL=240 PipStep=50. Total wins=48 Loss=1 and I've never seen the float over $1100.  
  
It is too soon to tell with my other tests do to a lack of trades opened so far.  
  
I am running other tests with adjusted settings for - MA_timeframe, Percent, DivergenceLimit, PipStep, and IncreasmentType.  
  
Is anyone else testing these of other unusual settings?

Hey guys, I've got two domains with unlimited space, i mentioned this before but the post might have gotten passed over.   
  
For a glimpse and what i've thrown up for a test-of-concept for a Phoenix Resource page [check this link out](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-phoenix/). We can do the same for Firebird. No Strings Attached. Always Free access. No Advertising.   
  
We can have a live Java Chat room (or similar), a trading Blog or whatever. None of this would take away from what we have here at FF w/Firebird (or Phoenix), it is just a supplement and central resource page for ease of organizing all this info.

It would be 5 if you count the regular 63G version (Not TS).

THX Yardie, so if this in fact is a welcomed idea, lets get the info organized that we want on the page and i can put it up straight away. I'll be back from my shift today at 7pm PT and check in here then. I'll get a test page up before work.

You can start off with the stuff posted by Skyline in the first post in this thread. We may also want to do a write up on the requirements for Firebird and how to install in.

Hello Yardie,  
  
Do you know if 63G-TS has the divergence fix?  
  
If not, can you, or anyone, post the version of 63G WITH the divergence fix.  
  
Thanks,

Forexpips,  
  
yes, latest version of FBv63g-TS has the divergence fix. I never know which Firebird thread to post EAs. I try to post v1.0s here and v63gs on the other thread. I just posted EA and settings on the other thread. Here is the link.

Hi all,  
  
The set up for the FB EA has a parameter called MA_timeframe. When demo testing, I've never changed the default setting (30). I changed the time frame of the test by using the window (i.e. M1, M5, etc.). However, if I feel the best setting is with the M1 TF, do I have to change the MA_timeframe setting to "1" for forward testing? Do I leave it on default and put the EA on a 1 minute chart?   
  
Thanks.  
  
Doug

Hi Doug,  
  
I'm pretty sure you leave it on 30 regardless of the timeframe you're trading on.

New to the Forex in which I have learned the basics from Peter Bain's course from forexmentor.com/  
  
I have installed FireBird on a demo MT4 with 5k and have the indicator on for EUR/USD. Is there anything else I need to do? Do I need to load the FB indicator on the other currency pairs to automate the trades?  
  
If there is a tutorial, please post the link.  
  
Thanks.

I had tried to set up a test before but did not have the discipline to follow through. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) If I remember correctly the 2 losses realized were GBP/USD. Otherwise, it booked quite a few pips.  
  
The problem I see is in the floats; once it gets out of control, it can tank fast. I like the hedging idea but may not be too easily achieved. In the 1B version where Wackena built in a hedge position for each main order, it appears that the TP and SL are the same as the main order. This probably isn't going to mitigate the high float situation too much when we get into one, correct?   
  
  
Mono,   
  
Regarding your idea of Mrs. Firebird (quite a hilarious post, too!), if I'm understanding it correctly, it sounds pretty good and can potentially mitigate the high loss situation where a trade stops out at 300. My question is the oscillation in between when Mrs. Firebird hedge order is opened and stopped. For example: suppose main order A moves past TP in the opposition direction in which case Mrs. Firebird order B has opened. Then, A retraces back and B stops out at SL+1 (which if I understand Mono correctly is BE+1, still positive). Now, does Mrs. Firebird know when to open another hedge order? If not, then A can still reverse and move towards 300 SL??

Thanks Blewmoon. Geeze looks like I have problems again. Firebird is not opening any order for me and its not recording anything in the journal to indicate what the problem is. Anyone got any advice? I already tried the delting and reinstalling etc.

Yardie,  
I have not had any trades opening in three different accounts, 2 demo's, one on Alpari, one on FXDD, and one live account on FXDD. The one demo and live account with FXDD, are both running FB63H02, and the Alpari account is running FB V1(1).0b2. I just assumed that the reason was that it is stuck in a channel. My percent setting are all at .1.

I have tried to add the trace when open orders, and got following errors:  
  
22:18:41 FireBird_v63 USDCHFm,M1: Error opening Sell order (130): invalid stops  
22:18:41 FireBird_v63 USDCHFm,M1: Error opening Buy hedge order (130): invalid stops  
  
Do not know why the stoploss is invalid.  
  
Thanks!

Hi all, opened up two demo accounts w/IBFX this am and placed the 63G-TS with stock settings on 1m charts and it is showing 3 trades open (USDCHF buy, EURUSD sell, GBPUSD sell) at -55.86.  
  
The v1b2 with stock settings on 1m charts is showing 10 trades (hedging) 2 each (buy/sell) in EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, and 4 trades on the USDCHF at -28.76  
  
All settings are default this week due to my complete lack of working knowledge on these as i'm still reading through the original thread, though i have read all of the "fixed" thread.  
  
Next Sunday i hope to have enough knowledge so i can open a couple more demo accounts with settings more fine tuned. Just need to read, read, and read some more. Good thing i enjoy reading and experimenting!

Hey Great people, I knew one day I would have to come out of the 'lurking' closet. Seven or eight months ago I barely knew what a forum was now I have subscriptions to threads flooding my e-mail daily. 10 months ago I was totally clueless about Forex but I've been reading and reading and applying... then I read some more and I don't think it's possible for your brain to hurt but seems like mine does. This forum - ForexFactory and this thread in particular is the best of the best.  
  
Anyway I think you're all geniuses, I mean it. Half the time I don't know what the %&^^$# you're talking about and the other half I can figure it out given enough time.  
  
What I wanted you guys to know is that I applied the newly modified 'Firebird_v1[1].0b2.mq4' from Wackena to these 10 currency pairs on a demo account and most of them opened positions right away if the were slightly ranging.

Just an observation, but FB tends to make a reversal trade after a spike has retraced by about 10 pips. I wonder whether it would be worth lowering the percentage to try to get in earlier on the retrace and book the pips earlier.  
  
anyone tried this?  
  
nice day so far today for turning the float into pips.

Please tell me who is SBFX... I am with Interbank (IBFX) and this morning all my running demo accounts was not accessable. (2nd time now) I contacted them and they told me that Metaquotes updated their demo server - deleting all demo accounts.  
  
I need an account on SBFX to prevent this.

Currently, in all FB versions, there is no trace for error messages when failed in sending orders. So we could not see why there are no trades opening.  
  
To catch the error, I made following changes to the FireBird:  
  
1) Included the header file stdlib.mqh to the FB at the first line.<STDLIB.MQH>  
  
2) for Sell order,   
  
int ticket=OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,slip,Bid+(Stoploss*Point),Bid-(TakeProfit*Point),GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenSell); // modified by Renato  
  
if(ticket>0) {  
Print("Opened Sell order.");  
} else {  
err = GetLastError();  
Print("Error opening Sell order (",err,"): ",ErrorDescription(err));  
}  
  
3)For Buy order:  
int ticket = OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,slip,Ask-(Stoploss*Point),Ask+(TakeProfit*Point),GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenBuy); // modified by Renato  
  
if(ticket>0) {  
Print("Opened Buy order.");  
} else {  
err = GetLastError();  
Print("Error opening Buy order (",err,"): ",ErrorDescription(err));  
}  
After added such error trace code, we may see why there are no trades.   
For example, I got another error:  
2006.08.28 05:47:40 FireBird_v63 USDJPYm,M1: Error opening BUY order (4109): trade is not allowed.  
  
But I do not understand why such error would happen.  
  
Thanks!

No, for me with FBv63g-TS and all v.10 versions, these are the changes from the set above.  
  
_MA_timeframe=30_  
_Percent=1.0_  
_TakeProfit=30_  
_Stoploss=300_  
_Use_V63D_Divergence=1_

Just an observation here on backtesting EA's using different brokers. I use both SBFX and FXDD, and have demo accounts with both (live only with FXDD). Last night I was backtesting different scenarios using FB 1.0a on both, and noticed that I was getting VASTLY different results with only slightly different settings. I then set both EA's to _exactly_ the same settings, and for _exactly_ the same time period and backtested (using every tick option as usual). The results weren't even in the same order of magnitude!! I also noticed that FXDD used more than three times as many bars in the backtest than did SBFX. I checked and rechecked that everything was set the same, and it was. The only conclusion I can make on this is that FXDD has a better data set for backtesting.  
  
Any other comments on this??

Wackena,  
  
Shouldn't the Percent setting be **_0.1_** , not 1.0?

Greetings - I was wondering if anyone could tell me why one of my trades ticket #10625131 closed at -$7.80 GBPUSD...why -78 pips? I'm running FBv1.0b2 right out of the box at IBFX on $1000 demo. Also do I need to change percent=1.0 to .10? Or .05 percentlike goran said in post#418  
  
Thanks for your help!

I believe most are using Percent = 0.05 or 0.1.

I think we should move this forward testing...forward. Another question that needs answering is the MA TF and the percent value. My live trial is using v63G with 0.05 and doing nicely with 25-0 trades in 2.5 days.  
  
Count me in for one of the trials but best if it's one which is 0700-2200 GMT (which is atrial in itself avoiding the asian session)

I agree cgldsmth, I'm ready to start with the formal forward testing so who  
ever is taking the lead to divvy out various parameters just let me know b/c I'm ready to go!

Yes, ready to go. Had three MT4 IBFX demos running through the Sunday open yesterday running 63G-TS, FBv1b2, and FBv1c without a hitch. If there is going to be someone compiling a list of "sets" count me in on helping with one or two at least.

**The lastest "Draft" of the FireBird Resource page:**  
[**http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/**](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/)  
**This is a permenant link and will not change so it is usable in the forums here as a pointer to the EA Archives and files.**  
  
**This is a PostScript thought:** For myself, and i don't mean to be a pain, i would actually prefer is there was an actual list of "To Dos" that included the exact set-parameters for a given EAversion. That was i would know i had not thrown in any of my bias or goof-ups in setting the test up.  
  
**Maybe??? >>>** There could be a new thread set up by one of you FB-Leaders/Mods and in the first post you could list the posting rules that would make such a thread usable, i.e. keep all the general Q's over here? Then simply list each of the dozen or so "test-set-rules" and each of the indicators? Better yet, how about a zip file for each test that includes the exact EA with the settings for that test as the defaults? That would mean names like 63G-01, 63G-02, FBv1b2-001, etc??? But surely, if this was done we would have exact data to go by without the human factor involved? [and i am volunteering to do this last part also...so there would actually be a downloadable EA version with the name of each individual "forward-test-setting".]  
  
**Also?? >>>** Remember that there is a resource page available and all the files could be placed there for the beta test. I'll spend some time over there today and include the PDF file and such. It's fun for me, and a blessing to help in such a way. : )

Do I understand that you shut off your EA during the hours of 2300-600 GMT?  
  
How do you do that? Do you close all open trades? Or, do you leave open trades but allow no new ones?  
  
Thanks for any advice here, just trying to understand your methods.

A moving average is calculated.  
Then that average is shifted x% upwards and x% downwards.  
  
x=percentage  
Just like envelope 

May the pips be with you.

I'm still working on it.  
  
I really need help on coming up with the different variables. The people that have studied the statements can probably be of most help. I'm really kinda shooting in the dark with these, some may be unnecessary or obviously faulty. I need to know which settings logically have merit. Otherwise, I'm afraid we're going to have too many combinations to properly test.  
  
The global ones (accross all versions) I've come up with so far are:  
  
1\. Time Period (on the chart)  
2\. Pairs - Here's on I need help on.  
I think that we should use different setups with the top 2,  
top 4,6,8, and 10 pairs. I've ordered the pairs from 1-10 based on  
ATR, but is that the best way? Should we number them according to  
risk, win ratio, what?  
3\. Brokers  
4\. MA Length  
5\. MA Timeframe  
6\. MA Type   
  
With 4,5, and 6, we're talking hundreds, or maybe thousands, of  
permutations.   
7\. Percent  
  
  
Do we need to use different TP,SL,Pipstep settings too? Cause now we're talking even more. What about trading times? Do we need to set it to only trade in certain hours for some of the tests?  
  
There's a section of the code dealing with divergence, iFX Analyzer I believe, that has multiple settings too (fast period/price, slow period/price). Do those warrant manipulation?  
  
Then there are the settings exclusive to the multiple versions themselves, which shouldn't add too much to the complexity, so I've been saving them for last.   
  
As if this weren't enough, we should probably run 2 or 3 of each setup allowing one to run unhindered, one reset every week, the other reset every other week.  
  
I'm sure there are some more I haven't even come up with yet.  
  
I hope everyone understands the magnitude of this. This would be completely overwhelming to try all the permutations I've outlined already, much less the ones I haven't. People that have a better understanding of the code need to tell me which ones we can eliminate or at least narrow the range. Those who have more experience in Forex need to analyze the statements and try to determine which pair/settings deserve more attention and what we can eliminate.  
  
I think we just need to narrow it down a lot. I also think that the complexity of administrating this is so, that it's only going to happen once, so we better get it right.   
  
Like I've said before, I'm willing to dole out the tests and track them, I'll even track the performance, but figuring out what all to test is going to take some (read a lot) help.  
  
I've made several posts so far about the variables I've thought of and asked what people thought, but no one has really said anything. If everyone is content in doing their own thing, fine, just let me know so I stop wasting effort. Doing a test like this is hard work, but it's also necessary in my opinion if we want to determine the best way to set Firebird up and standardize it's performance. Otherwise, we'll all being doing testing accross different time frames, with different set ups (variables not under our control) and judging performance on what may be a fluke.

I just shut down my PC but all the open trades are left on the broker's server. there's so many variables we could test in this EA, and a decent test should be a month (at least).

I don't know. This requires a little bit of investigation.   
  
Can you determne if it was the order a main order or hedge order? In the Journal, was this order closed (close) or did it hit a stoploss (s/l)?

I think it will be very hard to decide what settings have merit at this point. You may need to limit testing to a few settings to start.  
  
I have been testing on mainly one version using different settings on each demo. None of my tests have come close to Mono's results but that is not the point. Between back testing and now forward testing I may stumble on to a conservative safe earner in all market conditions. It takes a long time to optimize one currency pair. I won't be able to tell if any of this has helped me until I can test for a few weeks with at least one strong trend lasting several consecutive days in the test.  
  
I hope a few people try settings completely different than what Mono and others have posted. On my live account my settings are close to Monos, but on demos I have been using v0.1a and adjusting the following settings on various time frames with most pairs:  
MA_timeframe  
Percent  
TakeProfit  
StopLoss  
DivergenceLimit  
PipStep  
IncreasementType  
  
Is anyone back testing and optimizing, and /or forward testing with adjustments to the more unusual settings?  
  
Hagbard, I'm not suggesting trying to add a bunch of seldom changed setting to your test structure at this point. Instead I am hoping that if some people try a few unusual things on one demo they will be able to report any unexpected improvements after optimization and forward testing.

hi nvwine,  
  
have you any suggestion what for settings i can forward test? i ask because i started today some platforms (17 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) ) with FB on my other notebook, but the only thing i have changed was the timeframe. i test now the 5 versions on the 1min,30min,1h and 4H chart with the 30-300-30, and monos settings.  
  
so if you can give me any suggestion what for for settings would be worth to test then i would start them today.  
  
thx

I would suggest helping out Hagbard when his testing program starts. I'm not trying to compete or steer people away from an organized forward testing program. My point was it can be useful to experiment on one demo with some unusual settings.  
You can try increasing Percent until you have far less trades or changing PipStep to get more or less trades. I think Mono was trying out the PipStep a couple of weeks ago. I can't really say for sure in this area because I am just trying different things. I take a setting and back test and optimize with it for a given pair. If it varies or improves the results I then try forward testing. You can be looking for improvements in the float, stoploss amount, how fast it earns money vs. how safe it is, how different pairs react to PipStep for example, or how it responds to different types of markets.

Thank you!  
  
Maybe right now the best thing to do is for people to try some truly different setups (that were at least attempted to be logically supported) so we can have an idea of what to do, or more likely and more importantly, what not to do when the time comes for an organzied test.

I have started to do forward testing 10 hours ago but no trade has been concluded. I am using v1c modified by wackena and the setting is model from Mono. The forward test is for 8 pairs of currency with MA_timeframe = 15, percent = 0.1 and lot = 0.2. The chart window timeframe is M15. Btw is there any different between MA_timeframe and chart window timeframe?  
  
The forward test will run for this week and I hope to report any result on next week.

I would also like to know the answer to **divinefund's** question: "is there any difference between MA_timeframe and chart window timeframe?". The Firebird 1.0a version I use has the MA_timeframe parameter defaulted to 30 minutes. It's kind of puzzling as to what setting should be used on the different window timeframes.  
  
Secondly, I too would be willing to run several demo accounts for the purposes of testing/optimizing FB. Perhaps a table/matrix can be set up once the parameters have been agreed upon, and people can sign up. A fixed start date would be mandatory, as you couldn't really compare one months' results with another month. We should _first_ determine how many people/demo accounts we have at our disposal, then set the number of parameters accordingly. There's no point in planning a trial with 1000 variations when we have 200 demo accounts available.

Also along this line, I think it's important to try to minimize as many variables. Just to give an example, all the tests should be run on one broker's feed, instead of mixing them up as has been the case thus far. We need to compare apples to apples, so to speak.

Yes, there is a difference.  
  
The MA_time sets up the envelope in which Firebird executes trades, some people like a setting of 30 others 15.  
  
Placing Firebird on the 1Min chart helps with divergence, in other words spikes. If there is a spike in the 1min bar, it will not open a new trade until it subsides.

Finally, I found why sometimes there is no trades (when it should be).  
There is a bug in this version caused by following code:  
  
double value = iATR(NULL,PERIOD_D1,21,0);  
if(Point == 0.01) value = value*100;  
if(Point == 0.0001) value = value*10000;  
TakeProfit = value*2/10;  
Stoploss = value*2;  
PipStep = value/10;  
  
Sometimes, the iATR returns value of zero, this results in the zero of parameters TakeProfit, Stoploss and PipStep.  
  
This can clearly seen when you add following Print statment to the code and recompile it:  
  
Print ("Value from iATR is: ", value);  
  
You will see sometimes the value is really zero. Certainly, it causes failure in OrderSend because of invalid stop, invalid price, etc.  
In my previous post, I suggested to add error trace for OrderSend, and I got various error such as  
Error opening Sell order (130): invalid stops.  
  
Please keep in mind the problem only happens when Daily True Average Range is zero. Because of this bug, the test of this version would be unrealiable.  
  
Thanks!

Thanks Mono for the clarification.  
  
So the MA_timeframe is used by firebird to determine envelope where trading opportunity arise when signal is out of the envelope. Whereas timeframe on chart is to observe the spike ( of course the higher timeframe the lessor spike to occur ).

why is my live version (63G) opening far fewer trades than the equivalent demo?  
  
also - is there any early data suggesting a difference in MA30 to MA15?

You mean the text in the top left of the chart?  
Some times are better than others for opening new positions.  
The bad times are "bad hours"  
You can configure those hours in the EAs input window. 

May the pips be with you.

I don't know why it did not open hedge order on buy eurjpy, because they are no pre-qualifiers between the main ordersend op_buy and hedge ordersend op_sell. op_sell immediately follows op_buy. A mystery to me.  
  
After the last line above, what did the next line in Journal state?

You mean the time between closing and opening hour TraderSeven?  
If that's the case, I shouldn't get "bad hours" right now.

There are 3 sets of hours.  
a] What you see on the clock in your home.  
b] Server time. -> What you see on the chart.  
c] Time of the market.  
  
a] is not relavant.  
  
You have to align b and c.  
13:00 NY 'stockmarket time' could be 07:00 broker time.  
Because MT4 uses chart/server/broker time you have to enter 07:00 not 13:00 

May the pips be with you.

It might caused by "Invalid reason". I added the error trace code and got it from IBFX.   
  
2006.08.29 00:35:24 FireBird_v63 EURUSDm,M1: Error opening Buy hedge order (129): invalid price  
  
Do not know why the price is invalid.

I want to say that it's related to slippage in a way. If I remember right, it's saying that it won't execute your order since it's trying to base it off of a price parameter that doesn't exist anymore since the price has moved even just a pip? I would think if you allowed a slippage of say two pips, it should work itself out? Bueller? Bueller?

Why, why, why can't the world just sell one kind of auto, one brand of cigs, and have server times set to some regular time zone? grrrrr.in  
  
So i'm looking at my MT4 charts, I trade manually off of the Alpari feed which is simple and sweet set to C.E.T. makes some sense. Then i opened three accounts for my demo test on 63G-TS, v1-0b2, v1-0c1, (all set to defaults) and reaslize this morning they are set to GMT-1 which is in the Azores. Why the heck would anyone set there server time to the Azores...it's nothing but a rock in the Atlantic with an air base! Silly.  
  
Oh well...the test goes on. As of 15:00ish EST (or noonISH here on the Oregon Coast) i have the following from my Sunday Open start:  
  
version___closed___float______net  
  
63G-T___456.46___(419.48)___36.98  
  
v1-0b2 __740.27___(618.24)__122.03  
  
v1-0c1___887.89___(201.14)__686.75  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

hi  
  
i have started yesterday 3 FB 63g-TS with some diffrent settings but i will stop now with testing of this three, becos since i have put them on my laptop its only lagging (maybe 13 MT and other stuff is too much ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) )  
  
i have attached the files. all three have now much less float as today in the morning. as i started them yesterday they all had float of 200-500 after a few hours, it was too much for the short time imo. however 1 day is too short to give an opinion about this settings...

The floating crap on this EA is so disappointing. Most ofthe time 90% of the profit is taken up by floating loss. There has to be a way to fix that.

I have heard that this system is good.. However, I could not seem to figure out the correct settings for a backtest. Has anyone been able to back test it with any success?

OK. Do not watch this EA on a daily basis. Set it up and let it run. Go play golf or watch TV. Leave the EA alone.  
  
Just run on USDCHF, EURUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD. Make sure $1000 account for each .1 standard lot. Just try the original 30-300 -30 settings on an M1 timeframe.. Let it set in for about a week or ten days and then look.

I was recently backtesting the FB EA in Strategy Tester, and settings that worked well the previous night weren't working AT ALL. I checked and re-checked all inputs and settings, timeframes, dates, etc., and everything was the same as my previous days' settings. Then I noticed in the Report section, that the "bars in test" was only 1681 !!. I was on 1M charts with the test period set for one month (there are 1440 minutes in a day, so this was only a little more than a day's worth of bars). I increased the the number of days in the test, and it zipped right to conclusion (with no results), and still only had 1681 bars.   
  

  
Thanks in advance for ANY assistance on this matter.

Hello all,  
  
I am running Firebird 63G TS on 5 pairs: GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, and USDJPY.  
  
Only ONE trade has been opened on the JPY. In the last 24 hours, no new trades have been opened.  
  
Any ideas as to why? (I have checked settings, the EA IS enabled, and everything else seems to be fine. Why only one JPY trade? It has been moving so many more should have been initiated. On that particular pair, my settings are 22/220/22 with a trailing stop of 17.  
  
Any help would be appreciated.  
  
  
best,

Hello,  
  
How does this EA work? I tried to drag the firebird v63 to the chart, but nothing happen.   
  
Does this need to be in live account or sth?

trituetrade,  
  
Once you drag the EA to the chart, there are two things (minimum) you need to do. First, right click on the mouse, choose 'expert advisors', properties, common tab, and check off the button to allow for live trading. Second, you have to hit the "Expert Advisors" button on the toolbar. At this point in time, a smiley face will (should) appear in the top right corner.   
  
This is the same process for either a demo or a live account. Once you do this, you can adjust the settings, or 'inputs' on the EA.

It looks like you have successfully implemented the EA, as I can see a trade has already been made (unless you did this manually). Do you see the smiley face in the top right corner of the trend window?

Just curious Taksid, when you say most of the time - what do you mean? I'm willing to bet that, at best you have dedicated no more than 2 days of forward testing to this EA... if that. If you're so dissatisfied with the float (apparently due to a lack of comprehension of the way Firebird works), then let me recommend some more profitable EA's like "MACD" and "Moving Average"...they come packaged with MT4 (FOR FREE!!!!!) <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

Hi Dcraig,  
  
Thanks for the response.  
No, I dont have any smiley face in that corner,  
Can you instruct me to make it work?  
Do I need to adjust anything in the MetaEditor or just drag and drop the Firebird into the chart? If it is, just drap n drop, I have done so, but nothing appear on the screen! ???

Make sure you stored it to the experts folder not the indicators folder. If it is in the experts folder is it the same color as the other experts?

OK.   
  
I read all the firebird threads, learned about 55% of EA lingo, downloaded one of the firebirds, opened an account with North Finance, made a deal with a mafia don, struggled with installing the damn thing, re-read all the threads, sacrificed a goat to the fell powers of the pit, read the threads again, and then took two hours figuring out how to make the &^% happy face.   
  
I am now ready for Firebird to make me millions. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):  
  
I still dont know how to alter the settings, or even really get which settings I should use, but hopefully, seeing it for real will teach me more than reading ever could.   
  
May I ask, how we are feeling about the EA overall?? Some say it's a pip machine, but Traderseven seems to think we need a lot more work. And also ( I think to myself) if Firebird is working, then why would we ALSO need a phoenix?

That's easy with Firebird.  
But don't be suprised that suddenly it takes back all those millions.

I would advise 2 hours looking at a chart with the envelope plotted on it.  
Set up a chart with a envelope so that 95% of the prices stay in the channel. Then look at the places where price breaks the channel and what happens next.....

I've been to long away from Firebird (and this thread) to know what changed in the code, but from what I've read Hendrick is aware of the drawdown issue and is trying to fix it.  
v1.x seems to have hedging. That's certainly a good risk control too.  
There are to many versions to judge but I noticed that the original rules are broken on at least one versions.  
When PipStep is reached a position is added but not averaged.  
Averaging makes the chances of winning higher/faster.  
So it will reduce the float.  
  
This is just demo trading but in real trading I would like to suggest some other way of burning cash ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Trade on as many uncorrelated pairs as possible (size down) trade on as many time frames/settings as possible. The aim is to get uncorrelated trades.  
Meaning that they move independantly. If all all pairs get hit by a drawdown the float gets high. When market conditions return to 'normal' all positions cash in. IF you didn't get a margin call.  
If everything is uncorrelated profit roll in gently and constantly.  
With correlated settings you build up a lake of _potential profits_ that gets cashed in one lucky day. The only profit is the one in your account. So I prefer the uncorrelated approach...  
  
That's are the reasons why I don't trade Firebird. (but still see potential for it)   
Rember we are trying to steal pips from the big banks with zillions of resources, 1000's of full time analysts and 100's of number crunching mainframes.  
It won't be easy! 

May the pips be with you.

Hi Forexpips, I've given the link here to the folder containing my most recent three statements which i began a new forward test Sunday afternoon. If you look in the folder please not the one with the 63G-TS. There you will see over a dozen trades taken for the GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD pairs. I never warmed up to the jpy in manual trading so i didn't bother w/fb.  
  
Not that the above will "help" but there were trades being taken by the default 63G-TS through my InterbankFX demo account.  
  
<http://www.accrete.com/fx-posts/eafb-statements/>  
  
Cheers,  
Thom  
  
PS, Oh Jason, you made my day with your witt and humor...glad to see you still have it after the usual EA-ramp-up.

So, let me tell you my scheme. It's classified, so you can't tell anyone.  
  
I have subscribed to James16's super secret-underground mystery lair. (Which is what he calls it behind everyones back ) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) Here, I will learn how to be the trader I want to be. I honestly believe that if I do my homework and play right, someday I can be sucessful at this thing we do.  
  
(All humor aside, I really do believe in this group, just from my limited exposure. They really seem to make it possible, as long as I am willing to work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))  
  
I was hoping, however, that in the meantime, a certain EA might make me some money, might get past the weaknesses that I have as a year-old trader. But but but..what settings would I use? How would I set it up? All mysteries. (Tomorrow, maybe I should print out the hundred pages on the subject and take them to a soothsayer...)  
  
So I thought that the EA might make me something in the meantime. It seems like many many people had a lot of luck with it... seventeen zillion wins and 0 losses, stuff like that. Even people who were trading live seemed to be making it work.   
Thats what I wanted. It wasn't until Traderseven came along that I really came to hear the drawdown of the EA at all. People had issues, but it seemed like they fixed them just as quickly.  
I began to suspect that perhaps I wasn't hearing the bad as often.   
  
I've put just a little ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1) time into reading. How many people are live with Firebird now? How many of those are happy with it?  
  
Thanks you guys. I really appreciate this community!!

Very, very early in the forward testing for me...but here is what i can say. Suppose i had opened up a 500mini account and traded it at the micro level. Tonight at 23:00ish Pacific Time, on the top performer (v1.0c1) of the three in my small test i have 917 positive pips closed, and no losses in the closed trades, and 232 negative float. IF, If i decided to close things out after only running this from this past Sunday at market open to tonight (a bit over 2 full day's trading including the UK holiday), i would have banked 685 positive pips or an average of over 340 pips each day. I have NEVER even dreamed of having a 300+ pip day! Maybe i'm thinking to small? But what if it was only half or one quarter this good in a live account? Anyone could/should be able to make a decent living (i know i could w/my simple lifestyle!).  
  
The test goes on.

Yes Accrete, it does work well during minor news weeks. I, like you, would be happy if it could bring in 50 pips a day. But to my surprise, when its doing 3000 pips a week, you have to take notice of its acheivements.  
  
There is also a downside, and it usually comes on NFP week and the week after, when major data comes out. Luckly the interest rate hike for EUR & UK happened last month, so its unlikely any major movement will happen (fingers crossed). So the 2 statements I'm worried about for September is NFP this Friday and FORMC on the 25th. In between those 2 dates should bring lots of pips.

To me and my trading style, this is why I opened up testing on 1.0A as it is the more "slow and steady" of the group of three Firebirds. I like having a limited float, especially if it is all encompassed by my total gains. That being said, I ran a demo of 1.0C and it did tack on some impressive results, but it made me uneasy having four trades float around at $-600 in my open trades by themselves out of a total float of $-900 compared to $950 booked gains. After removing the troublesome pair (GBP/JPY) from my trading, I have booked a solid $450 in the past 24 hours on mini lots on six pairs with a maximum float of about $-250. So overall, I would call that good progress ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). I give my humble thanks to mono, traderseven, et all who have put forth their time and effort into Firebird because I think that they really are onto something worthwhile.

Try a backtest to determine if the EA is placing orders. If not, I suggest downloading and reloading the EA.

hi chad  
  
i opened last friday or thursday a live account with ibfx. i am using v 1.a 30-300-30 but i think i will switch to 63g-TS becos on my demo account it has often a lot of float less then the 1.0a and the pips are nearly the same (atm has the 63g-TS more pips booked)

Hi Mono ( : and all : ), what is the general thought on NFP and other big "news" do you turn off the EAs? Just wondering with the big day coming up this Friday.  
  
_EA demo as of this post at 5am Pacific Wed IBFX demo all at default settings, opened this last Sunday:_  
_v1-0b2 closed +829 float -607_  
_v1-0c1 closed +1024 float -228_  
_63G-TS closed +587 float -417_

270 pips not much for 2 days trading?  
That's $27k/month if trading full lots.  
  
Even 10 pips a day is great. Think about the compouding effect.... 

May the pips be with you.

Thom,  
  
My oppinions are simply that. I am seriously considering closing all positions before the release comes out. In addition to turning off the EA. The problem is that noone knows how the market will react this time. It may be the best trading day of the week. So as usual I am hesitant. I think there is some merit in closing all positions after a period of time and starting again. Especially when positions stray too far. I have 2 EUR/JPY short trades that are getting close to being stopped out. USD/JPY has a few also. I think this is the hardest thing with this EA. It  
s hard to know when to take a small loss as the strategy depends on a large stop loss. The whole thing is so unconventional that it's difficult to know what to do. Do we step in and possibly ruin a good mechanical system with our personal flaws or just let it do its stuff. I would like to just let it run but the fear of a possible large loss sometimes gets the better of me.  
  
Wiz.

Yes it's like living in fantasy land. Just wondering when the storm will hit. When will the bird die?

I am beginning to think version b Hedge has flaws. I am booking a lot of pips, but a lot of it is being eaten up by floats. I didnt see this when I was using the non-hedge versions of the EA. What kind of results have you guys been getting so far this week with the other versions?

I'm running v63G_fixed. I'm using Mono's settings for the s/l, tp. I trading on a mini demo account with IBFX, using .6 lots on each currency. I'm trading USD/CAD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, USD/CHF. I started with $7000, on 8/22. The largest negative float I've seen in the week I've been running it is eariler today with -$422.  
  
Balance $8775.52  
Equity $8522.39  
Margin $510  
Free Margin $8009.39  
Float -$259.66  
  
I'm really pleased with how this is performing, but I think the key to trading FB is to close out all open trades periodically and start anew. It probably makes the most sense to do this a day or so before large news events. And stand aside for a bit while the market settles down and then start FB once again.   
  
I'm testing FB using different settings, but I think I like this on the best because of the small negative float. I'm preparing to go live with this one on Sunday.

Maybe we should do some historical float research.  
I have no idea how to code it but I would like the backtester to print to a csv file which can be imported into Excel. The EA should run on D1 because else we get a overload of data.  
The .csv file should contain:  
  
\- Date.  
\- Negative float.  
\- Positive float.  
  
Each pair it's own data .csv  
Plus a combined .csv  
  
Then locate the point with a high float and so some historical research.  
Things like:  
\- What day triggered the float?  
\- Was it related to news?  
\- Was it related to low volume? (holiday season)  
\- Are some pairs more resitant to float than others?  
\- Do the floats of certain pairs even eachother out?  
\- etc 

May the pips be with you.

Well, according to my back testing Firebird may not die, but it certainly may look like a lame duck for extended periods. Took me awhile to get around to it, but I've finally managed to test 3 of better performing pairs lately... EUR/USD, USD/CAD, and USD/JPY back to 12/1/2004. Not that back testing is everything, but I think the larger the time frame (due to more data points), the better idea how a system is likely to behave... at least as long as my test data is good, which I have no idea. (got it from <http://www.alpari-idc.com/en/dc/databank.php> )  
  
I did my testing with the current popular settings (T/P = 30, S/L = 300 on the 1 minute chart, etc.). The results show a slow bleed from 12/04 - 6/05. It may be longer but my data doesn't go back any further.   
  
I'm not sure what changed about the market conditions in June '05, but it must have been significant because results are definitely different from June 05' - present. And the difference seems to affect all three pairs similarly (probably because they're USD based). I'm thinking that whatever conditions contributed to Firebirds poor performance during that time are likely to come around again. Maybe soon.  
  
Right now, my opinion is that this is a good EA in that it doesn't seem to lose money when left alone (many do), but over the long haul it isn't going to take anyone from "rags to riches". I do think that returns can be improved with smart manual intervention, but those improvements will be incremental not exponential. I hope this doesn't pour cold water on anyone's party... And it is my hope that somebody can provide different/better back test results that will refute my tests.  
  
Edit: Got a little more data back to 6/04. Will add this to my testing...  
Edit # 2: After some more testing, I have a pretty good suspicion the test data from Alpari is FUBAR'd prior to 10/05, so forget I said anything. ;-)

hi  
  
mid week update of my 5 version which i am testing.  
  
up to now is my favorite the v63g-TS and the 1a, but the 1a has at the moment a lot of float but ~the half of it is only due to GBP/JPY. i have removed today this pair from all 5 versions.  
  
i also have noticed that the v1.0c had today 2 EUR/JPY losses. is anybody else testin v1.0c who can confirm those loosers today?

I've been lurking a little bit.  
  
I have a suggestion on the issue about closing down the EA before news, etc. The EA would still manage stop losses, so, your positions should exit if it goes against you. It would also manage TP as well, if the news is with you.  
  
It seems that the biggest concern about news trades is opening new positions either because of the news, or just before the news.  
  
Instead of closing everything down, why not just have a boolean flag that tells Firebird to not make any new orders. Turn the flag on a day before a big news event. Turn it off a day after the news.  
  
Anyway, I'm not sure if that would really solve the issue or not. I don't know enough about how the EA works to comment intelligently.

i think those open trades which will hit their SL during big news days are the one which are opened for about a week or so...

Assuming thats right there is no use closing positions (that are close to SL) just before news.  
The news will take the stops out or if you are lucky you catch a spike that hits your TP 

May the pips be with you.

Over time, the logic of Firebird should prevail - that a price will deviate toward the mean after a spike. FB needs to win 10 for every 1 loss to make a profit. My first demo (now just over a month old) is 308-7. the logic seems to be skewing things well in favour of take-profit. the probability of big news going against is 50%. therefore over time, it shouldn't make any difference. In fact, since FB thrives on spikes-retracements, this EA should work well on news days in the long run.  
  
demo statement attached.  
  
live account currently doing very well also.

Yardie,  
  
The same is here, concerning one of my tests on the 15 minutes time frame the negative float is greater than the profit having the test running for 1.5 weeks.  
  
I think the reason for this is that when hedging Firebird 1.0b versions open two _market_ orders (one buy and one sell) at the same time. So one of the buy _or_ sell orders will always go against us meanwhile the other goes to profit. But one of the two orders will remain there for long and increase the float, particularly in a trending market. According to the best case scenario first the first one then the other takes profit, but in the worst case scenario the first one then the other will stop out - depending on the market movement.  
  
Other strategies, such as news trading straddle EAs, open _pending_ orders both sides of trade (buy and sell). Once the first pending order has been activated the other side is liquidated and the positive is used to go to profit direction. This way _only one_ order will be activated and in a trending market it probably goes to the profitable direction and the float can be retain on a reasonable level.

This is a good point. Maybe we need to make a variation of this version and compare the two. The new version would close out or liquidate the other order once one side was activated. I think that this would help the float also. Any other thoughts on this? Is there anyone willing to program this change?

Alpari provides "bad" rates. They use "cheap" traffic. Some experts do not work with it at all.

ART,  
  
SO far the B1 looks the best in terms of how much your balance would be if all open positions were closed. The return since August 23rd would be over 10%.

You are using on the 1 minute time frame though correct?

There are some debate on whether FB can handle breaking news, if you look at the nature of FB is to take small profit during normal spike along the trend or ranging market. But breaking news may wipe out the gain profit in a short time of trading. Take for an example of setting 30-300-30 method with one currency.  
  
If there are 5 trades where 2 are closed trade with 30 pips profit, 1 trade with 15 pips in progressiive profit and the other 2 trades in 10 pips loss as float. When the breaking news come out, either up or down heavily with surprise to the market. That is the market may swing more than 300 pips.  
  
If the existing trade is in favor to the news, then the 3 trades will conclude with another 90 pips in total which give a total of 150 pips for 5 trades. But for the other way round, the existing 3 trades will give 900 pips loss and the nett loss is 840 pips.  
  
Hence my point is it may be good to close all the trades before the breaking news.

As I mentioned in my earlier post, FB is performing bound scalping for the small profit during the normal spike. It doesn't matter for the market in ranging but not for trend market.  
  
In trend market, the price can start from small pips until the top trend of say 400 pips. Take up trend as an example, if FB trade short when there is a spike for take profit environment in the initial trend. Then that trade will not close when the trend is heading upward until SL is hit. This is why some member do encounter a SL of 300 pips 20 days later.  
  
Hence my suggestion is 1:3 ratio or not more than 1:5 ratio should be used instead of 1:10 ratio.

Hi Wizard, thx for the insights. I think in a live account i might go ahead and at least turn off the ea during the actual announcement, and maybe even close out all trades if it is a big day such as NFP. This Friday? Well i'll probably let it just go since it is only a demo and i'm trying to get the feel of it all.  
  
Art1 hope you figured out those losses. I'm not trading that pair, but so far my 1c is the heads-above winner. The only losses i've incurred have been with the 63G-TS in my testing (but to soon to tell anything of real meaning). . .after NY close:  
  
EA demo as of this post at 6PM Pacific Wed IBFX demo all at default settings, opened this last Sunday:  
  
_v1-0b2 closed +859 float -797 net = +62_  
_**v1-0c1 closed +1165 float -439 net = +726**_  
_63G-TS closed +636 float -707 net = -71_

Yardie,  
I am running one live and one demo with Version b.2. I had no winning trades on the demo today while the float crept to 90% of the profit because of additional positions put on. The live account had one trade in profit but also increased float considerably. Perhaps this is just the market today. I have two trades that are six days old, the rest just a few days and newer.   
Any thoughts on my comment presented in my earlier post and the one prior to it in regards to closing out a pending order once order in opposite direction is activated, similar to straddle EA's?  
  
I'm also continuing to have problems with "Excessive Loss" Alerts even when line is commented out (I get warnings when I comment it out in V 1b also). Will this alert prevent orders from being placed. I get this alert in FB 63HO2, as well as 1b. Any thoughts on getting rid of this annoyance?   
  
Thanks Yardie. I appreciate your hard work on this EA.

I am not having the excessive loss error with Firebird at the moment so I cannot comment much on that. Maybe Wackena or one of the other coders can provide some more assistance.  
  
So far this week I have made over 1200 pips, yet I am in deficit for the week. I suspect that 1.0b doesnt like tight ranging markets. It likes when the market moves up and down. The past day or so the range in the eurusd has been a mere 50 pips..the same with the usdcad. I think things should be shaken up tomorrow with news and Friday with NFP.

INteresting statistics Accrete. Thanks for sharing. Other reports posted on the weekend showed that 1.0c wasnt all that hot...now its shining so far this week. Hmm. I think 1.0b will be the leader when we report the results on Saturday though...thats just my bet. A lot of the float will become booked pips with the news due tomorrow and Friday.

Yardie,  
  
Well, I also made lots of pips with version 1.0b but I think the issue is caused by hedging **market** orders instead of **pending** orders as I stated in details in my earlier post here: [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=510](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=92213&postcount=510)  
So, I think placing pending orders would - at least partly - be a solution for the increasing float.  
This way we would lose approx. 10 pips per hedge order but could get rid of the high float.

1trader2,  
  
Thank you for your reply. I am not a programmer but the routine for "placing a hadge pending order then liquidate the other once one side was activated" is ready and available since straddle EAs use this technique. I think the application of that routine to Firebird could be resolved by a coder.

I don't see how a hedge can cause a extra float.  
Besides the costs for buying lots needed for building the hedge everything should even out AFTER the building of the hedge.  
When the hedge is build when the float is -300 pips that float will never increase because the profit and loss from thereon will even out.  
But the situation can last a long time. Assume it takes 2 months to return to the right level. That would be 2 months of tied up money.  
Say the hedge saves you 500 pips in losses but also keeps you out of 800 pips of gains because it tied up all your funds we still are on negative ground.  
The only ways around that are no hedge or try to detect the reversal point.  
Drop the hedge (profit) then wait for the TP. Float increases again but you have profits also locked in.  
  
An aditional problem is whipsaws. Like always.... 

May the pips be with you.

TraderSeven,  
  
You are right the profit and loss from hedge will even out - but only till one of the orders reaches TP. After that the reamaining order increases the float for a while.

Well since i posted my test numbers at NY open and close here are today's NY open numbers:  
  
EA demo as of this post at 6AMish Pacific Thursday IBFX demo all at default settings, opened this last Sunday:  
  
_v1-0b2 closed +958 float -820 net = +138_  
_**v1-0c1 closed +1325 float -450 net = +875**_  
_63G-TS closed +635 float -683 net = -48_  
  
The numbers were actually adjusted while i wrote this...they went into more net profit. The largest being the b and c versions. Anywhoo like we all know, it's fun to track but to little info to call. For myself it will most likely be that i keep testing for several months before jumping live into this, or maybe just a very small expendable duplicate micro-lot account for the "fun" of it. I still must state mater of factly that those 800ish pips in the c version would have been the most stress-less pips in a live account that i've ever made _in a month_...and these are only after 3 trading days!  
  
One other little test i've had going is the v63G-TS default but on a 15m chart instead of the 1m. It finaly had some trades kick in after about 12hrs being on: closed +135 and -2 float. Very odd to me though is the closed trade log showing +75, +58.69, +7.81, and a negative -6.75?? on the usdcad. That must have been the trailing stop kick in at an odd level? Anyone else showing odd closures on the TS version?

I assume the hedge has no TP so it are the original orders that have the TP hit. If my assumption is correct I think dropping the hedge should be done more intelligently.  
  
Say we hit -300 and thats our point we build a hedge.  
We get hit by another 1000 pips but the hedge evens that out  
After that 1000 pips price goes back in our favour and moves to our TP of 30 pips. The hedge gets dropped. Is that how it works now?  
Ideally the hedge should be dropped at that 1000 pip mark. It cashes in 1000 pips. The float will suddenly jump 1000 pips. But in a way it's still hedged by the 1000 pips in your account so in a way it's still hedged. And more importantly it stops a margin call.  
On top of that we collect the normal profits.  
It's hard/impossible to detect that turning point but I think the aim should be cashing in on the hedge too. 

May the pips be with you.

Very odd to me though is the closed trade log showing +75, +58.69, +7.81, and a negative -6.75?? on the usdcad. That must have been the trailing stop kick in at an odd level? Anyone else showing odd closures on the TS version?

I am running forward test on v1oc1 since 29th Aug 2006 with 8 pairs of currency, the current status is nett profit of $10036 including the float of $5484. The initial depost is $41677 ( after stopping from other strategy ). There were 73 trades closed with postive profit and 23 pending trades ( float trades ). Hence in 2.7 days a nett pips of 1003 is gained or 371 pips gain a day.

I also notice that the float is maintained around 8 to 10% of the capital under the normal market condition. But it may go as high as 20% if the spike is against the strategy with a swing of 100pips on some pairs of currency.

I am going to let all 8 of my FB demos (various flavors) rip right thru the NFP as usual. That is what demos are for I think.  
  
By the way, my LIVE account on Firebird will be off until nest Tuesday! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

TraderSeven,  
  
Thank you for your reply, you have some very good points.   
If the hedging worked as you wrote it down, then the float would not increase. But I think now the hedge orders work on the same way as the normal orders, that is, using the settings of 30-300-30 and assuming the market goes to one direction for 300 pips, taking only one hedge order into consideration, there will be 30 pips profit and 300 pips loss, the balance is -270 pips. During the way to 300 pips, until we reached the first 30 pips the two orders even out but beyond 30 pips the negative float will increase.  
  
The ideal case would be if the market turned back right after 30 pips and would go back 60 pips from there giving us the possibility to take out the other 30 pips profit. So, a ranging market is advantegeous for this trading system.  
  
Getting back to the example above, in reality, I think (but am not sure) hitting the first 30 pips and taking profit initialises another hedge order and so on and so on. Consequently, when we reach 300 pips we will have 10*30 pips profit (leaving the spread out of the calculation) and 9 pieces of floating losses: at -30; -60; -90; ... -270 and a 300 pips loss. At this case the net balance is zero and the _negative_ float is 1350 when we reach the milestone at 300 pips.   
If I was right, a trending market would be disasterous with this model.  
  
Using pending orders instead of market orders when hedging and keeping live only the "right" half of the hedge pair and going along that 300 pips route we could reach 7*30 pips profit and would have 10 pips _positive_ float assuming the gap were 10 pips at each order (300 = 8*10 gap + 7*30 profit + 10 float).  
  
Any advice would be appreciated.

Hi Divinefund,  
Did you use the money management routine and MaxOpenOrders routine ? Did you use the defaut parameters ?

Just to tell you guys, that my FB 1.0a was beaten by all the negative swap last night (wednesday). I counted about 300 pips loss due to swap, cause the float was big. If ever I go live with this, I am thinking about closing all trades that would lead to negative swaps each wednesday, but I am not sure if this is not going to interfere with the way FB works.  
  
Any advice is welcome.

Although this wont affect some Firebird EAs, I wonder if it will affect the hedge version.  
  
Here's the email I received.  
  
**Dear Interbank FX Customer,**  
  
**We are putting into place some company policies that will directly affect your account. As of market closing on Friday Sept. 15, 2006 we will no longer allow any one account to have more than 100 open trades.

The MaxOpenOrders = 10 and MM is false until I changed it to true a day ago. I use Risk = 5, hence all my TakeProfit:Stoploss ratio are changed accordingly, that is if my Takeprofit is 20 then stoploss is 100.

Thanks for the info on that email. Yes interesting. I have yet to count the open trades, seems to be around 6 or so per traded pair at any given time?  
  
EA demo as of this post at 6PMish Pacific Thursday IBFX demo all at default settings, opened this last Sunday:  
  
_v1-0b2 closed +1152 float -757 net = +395_  
_**v1-0c1 closed +1620 float -345 net = +1275**_  
_63G-TS closed +1044 float -490 net = +554_  
  
_Not that i can directly compare the test cuz i only began this one 24hrs ago...on a 15m chart instead of the 1m charts above:_  
_63G-TS closed +272 float +47 net = +319_  
  
Wow what an interesting day for the testing here. The largest turnaround was the 63G-TS which added 600ish pips. Some of the trades are 50+ pips! I clearly need to study what is going on behind the scenes here. If one wishes to see the trading logs, [they can be found here](http://www.accrete.com/fx-posts/eafb-statements/), under the 08-31 date.  
  
Take care. Tomorrow is the big day! I'm leaving all the eas just a purrin', hey it's just virtual dollars anyway : )  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

What is the definition of an open trade? Is it the ones that reside on the IBFX server or does it also include the pending limits and stops?

I've had as many as 41 open trades on one FB account.  
  
I think they are trying to control some EAs that open tons of trades all at the same time. There are several floating around over on the yahoo metatrader group. (Farhad Crab etc.) Also there may be some grid traders that get a little unruly.  
  
I don't believe stops and limits would construe an "open" trade however.

Hi Fellow firebirders.  
  
Attached is my results for about 2 weeks.  
  
I'm using demo ibfx, with version 1c, no settings changed, just plain 1c and no time settings changed etc.  
  
I'm very excited about results, approx 2000 pips, with approx 140 pips floating, only trading micro lots so profit is not much.  
  
I plan to go live with these 6 pairs next week with micro lots,  
eur/usd usd/jpy aus/usd usd/cad usd/chf eur/chf  
  
I'm wondering if any of the people here that are familiar with firebird can tell me if I'm missing something and shouldnt' go live yet, I plan on leaving time on default as it's been trading awesome like that, I just wonder if I'm missing something in the excitement, any comments appreciated before I go live. I figure if I can get 1000 pips up live, then I'm up and away, I have alot of room to play with, then I can just let this thing slowly build a fortune.  
  
Will only be starting with $600 , $100 per pair, on micro  
  
There was about 3 trades in the report that aren't firebird, just so you know.  
  
Thanks to everyone for making this great EA.  
  
Please give me some feedback.

My self I think going live with Micro lots at least the first week is the way to go, since interbankfx uses two different servers on for demo and one for live, you will be able to see the difference. I recently signed up with Velocity4X they use one server for demo & live, however was only able to get 2 weeks on the demo with one extension, because of bandwdith etc. I will use them with mico lots the first week I live trade to see how everything works out.  
  
was your demo run on the One minute chart, and you did not add any set files and just put the EA on the Chart, and your posted results reflect that?

Opening a trade is done by either buying a lot or selling a lot.  
Everything else isn't counted.  
  
100 positions is quite much.  
If you are trading 100+ minilots consider playing full lots.  
Besides of that I'm pretty sure that buying 12345 lots just counts as 1 open trade. 

May the pips be with you.

Most people are using it on the one minutes chart. It would be a good idea to invest some time into read the whole thread.

Yes it's 1 minute charts, i just dropped the ea on, and let it go.  
If it works this well, I didn't see a need to change any settings etc.  
How do you find velocity4x, i've never heard of them?

I am posting a link to a thread about probability ratios posted by Silverpike. He may use different Firebird settings for his tests and the back testing might be suspect but the results are interesting. I need to re-read the thread after a break to better understand the whole idea.

Interesting thread, it seems firebird goes from a "marginally profitable" system over time under the "expectation" theory to a possibly "outstanding" one under the "sharpe rato" theory based on a win % of over 90%. To many variables for me to take it to seriously but interesting all the same.  
  
Unfortunatly i am still without adsl so am only launching fb for a couple of hours a day, but fb is still making good returns, i am running 63g, 1b and 1c, on 5k demos even running only a couple of hours a day 63g and 1b are doing well with 1b the best, yesterday it won 10 positions, overall from the 24th of Aug it is up $1284 with float of $416 1 c doesnt like only working a couple of hours a day as it hardly does anything.  
  
Im afraid its not very useful info but until i get my adsl back online (probebly another 3 weeks) i cant contribute any other way.

$100 per pair ? means 0.1 lot in mini account?

what's your strategy ??  
  
something cross my mind. I think there's no point to hold a losing position for 1 month, what would it be if all position are to be closed at the end of each week - thus help eliminates negative swap,   
  
any suggestions?

Just thinking out loud here.....  
  
Why don't we just pick the best performing two pair and double the lots?  
  
I don't see much reason to mess with stuff like EURJPY or EURCHF. I know next Tuesday I will go live with my favorite two pair only on 1.0c.  
  
Anybody see any major flaw that I am overlooking here? Thanks.

i think its up to you. but i think the same way. i am live now with 7 pairs but i will drop EUR/JPY AUD/USD and USD/JPY this weekend and stay with USD/CHF GBP/USD EUR/USD and USD/CAD. but i also know that this pairs are strong correlated so its maybe not the best way to trade live.  
  
btw which pairs are your fovorites?

Hi everyone. Let me just thank you guys for all the work you are doing and sharing with the rest of us.  
  
I have been reading both Firebird and the Phoenix threads and decided to do some tests. I started testing 1.0c yesterday with the default settings. I have had 15 trades, 13 - 0 winners and 2 are still open. I left it on right through NFP just because, and my trades came out ahead, but I'm not really giving that credence one way or the other since I just started testing this.  
  
My question is this. On all of my trades, it is opening the orders and only setting a target price of between 11 - 14 pips. If the default is 30 pips, and it is listed as that, why is it only stopping at such a small number? I looked back over the results from other people testing, and they have trades opening with target prices of 30 pips immediately, as would be expected, so I can't assume it's because I just started demoing. Any ideas?  
  
I'll try to upload my statement also, so you can see.  
  
Thanks

Hi,  
  
are you trading less than 0.1 micro with IBFX (0.01 or 0.05...)?If you are that is a reason.That happened to me before.

My demo with strategybuilkderfx has suddenly stopped working. I can login OK, but the price and the charts are stuck and won't budge. Do I need to reset something? I had an extended (about one hour) cable internet disconnection today which may have had something to do with it. My demo at Northfinance is working just fine though..even after the disconnection. Already tried opening and closing to see if that would help..still no dice.

Which version are you using? If you are using version 1.0c that may have something to do with it.

That's exactly my point of view too. I was trading live FB v1.0b2 for last seven days on my mini account 200$. I have been away of home a couple of days and today I closed all positions three hours before NFP.I got 62 wins, and booked 640 pips with around 30% of profit.I will start again on Sunday evening or Monday at 6am CET and run until next Friday.I will collect profit again or accept a loss whatever happens.I believe this could be a good way to manage the account

That happened to me twice.First with MT4 from metaquotes,after 3 days I redownloaded again and all data were still there.A couple of days ago the same happened with FXDD but I did nothing and next days was OK.I do not know what causes these problems.

I remember some people had played with the lots, and I wondered if I should have changed something, from .1 to .5 for example, but I didn't think that would matter because it should still see that the target price is 30. But, I'll be honest and tell you that the 100+ pages I've read are all starting to blur a little ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

The version set the TakeProfit dynamically using the following code:  
  
double value = iATR(NULL,PERIOD_D1,21,0);  
if(Point == 0.01) value = value*100;  
if(Point == 0.0001) value = value*10000;  
TakeProfit = value*2/10;  
Stoploss = value*2;  
PipStep = value/10;  
  
the value may be very small, sometimes, it can be 0. I have posted this problem for a few times but no one paid attention to it. If it is zero, it will not even open trades for you.

Ok,that was another thing I considered, I'm glad you pointed that out. I started running this last night when the market was relatively slow, so maybe it is averaging some low numbers or something. If there isn't a way to fix this by changing some values, I'll let it run until the end of the day and then reset the charts next week.

Thanks forex4sysg for pointing out this. But can some MQL expert confirm that, because, when with this code, there would be, for example, no open trade at all for GBP, since TakeProfit would be about 2 or 3 pips, and also very low takeprofits for other pairs ? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Hello all,  
  
I have just started testing FB...after having tried coding my own EA for about two weeks. It was fun but I could not turn any of my ideas into a profitable EA. (Backtester really sucks! if you know what I mean ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) )  
  
Anyway, after a day of demo trading with FB 1.0c1 with 30-300-30, I'm having a hard time figuring out what makes it place orders with arbitrary s/l and t/p.  
s/l ranges from 15 to 19 pips or so, and t/p 150 to 250 pips or so. My settings are as follows:  
  
MA_length=10  
MA_timeframe=30  
MAtype=0  
Percent=0.05000000  
TradeOnFriday=1  
slip=100  
UseMM=0  
Risk=5.00000000  
Lots=0.10000000  
TakeProfit=30  
Stoploss=300  
TrailingStop=0.00000000  
MaxOpenOrders=10  
MinMarginLevel=250.00000000  
Fast_Period=23  
Fast_Price=1  
Slow_Period=84  
Slow_Price=1  
DivergenceLimit=0.00200000  
Use_V63D_Divergence=1  
PipStep=30  
IncreasementType=0.00000000  
DVLimit=10  
PipsGoal=500  
PipsLoss=500  
GMT=0  
DST=0  
OpeningHour=0  
ClosingHour=23  
writelog=0  
  
Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with my setting?  
BTW, I'm using the FB downloaded from Accrete's website.  
  
Thanks. Spa

SPA, version 1.0c automatically changes the TP, and PIPSTEP in accordance with each different pair. For instance, it has been using 25 TP for USDCHF and 16 TP for AUDUSD. If you want the TP and Pipstep to be set only by you then perhaps use Version 1.0a.  
  
Heck, I've been running Hendrick's old Firebird H02 version and racking up major pips using Mono's settings for the pairs.

Hi ART. Glad to see which pairs you like. In all of my tests (11 platforms)over the last month to 5 weeks, the pairs which resoundingly score well are the USDCHF and EURUSD. I steer clear of GBPUSD because twice a year it goes on a 1500 pip march in one direction and that would be the end.  
  
So, I plan to load the lots on those two pair and let it rip! Tuesday 9AM CST.

A bit of a back flip  
  
  
**Dear Interbank FX Customer,  
  
Due to overwhelming customer response we have decided to modify our recent decision regarding open trade limitations.   
  
We announced yesterday that the open account limit would be 100 open accounts as of the 15th of Sept. That decision was ammended this morning. The new open account limit will be 500 at any one time. This will take effect on Friday the 15th of Sept after the market closes. At this time we have identified approximately 20 accounts that this will affect. If you are one of these accounts we will be contacting you individually to help ease you through the transaction.  
  
Remember, this change ONLY affects MT4 users.  
  
We thank you for continued support and involvement.   
  
Kind Regards,  
  
  
The Interbank FX Team  
  
  
**And to those who complained, **GOOD JOB  
**

I have had 15 trades, 13 - 0 winners and 2 are still open.

If the default is 30 pips, and it is listed as that, why is it only stopping at such a small number? I looked back over the results from other people testing, and they have trades opening with target prices of 30 pips immediately, as would be expected, so I can't assume it's because I just started demoing. Any ideas?

Alright...I took a nice long nap and came back and reread this thread. I realized that because I was using 1.0c, that my trades not always targetting 30 pips each trade meant the EA was working as intended.   
I guess it threw me off a little because I had loaded the EA the day before and turned it on briefly (I was making sure I could get it loaded and get a smiley face, etc). When I did, it actually opened a couple of trades with 26 - 30 pip TP's. It also opened trades in the GBPUSD. I turned it off for awhile, and came back a few hours later to start the test. When I left in on for the extended period of time, it only traded the AUDUSD, EURJPY, and USDCAD and USDJPY. I had it set up on GBPUSD, EURUSD, and USDCHF also but no trades were opened, which I thought was a little odd.  
  
I closed everything down, and am going to start testing in earnest next week, leaving it on 24/7. I'm also going to test 1.0a at the same time. We'll see what happens. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

I ended up closing all my live open positions before the NFP release. This meant taking a $120 loss from my $480 gains for the month. I guess that's only a weeks profits and given the possible risk it was probably a good idea. In this case I would have been better leaving it to do its thing.  
  
I'll start again fresh on Monday. Maybe with 1.0c  
  
Yardie, My SPFX demos all stopped just prior to the NFP release.

I have a demo with sbfx and mine has stopped working, too. The server time is stopped at 13:41...  
  
My first FB trade with sbfx using 63-ts was so memorable.  
With my $5 million demo account and MM function on, it opened a position for 250 lots! It went negative for like 10 pips and floating loss became more than $20k for that position only. I set t/p at BE and went to bed that day.  
  
What surprised me next day was that I had a swap loss of $1,500 with that trade and that was in just 2 and a half hours!

No with a mini account 0.1 is $1000, 0.01 is $100

I decided to leave my live account with FXDD running with Firebird 1.0b2 through the NFP report. There were no problems. I booked 360 pips for the day and cleared some of the float. There was no drawdown. My float = ~ 11% of my balance. I have been trading live since 8/22/06. My oldest open trade is from 8/25. My equity has increased ~52% in 9 days. Today, I also straddled the news using the Amazing EA, and made an additional 14 pips. However, I manually closed this prematurely (my demo accounts made 40 & 50 pips.) Needless to say, I'm very pleased.

If that's because of firebird then some people would be making at least a couple of thousands dollars each day!   
  
I wonder what happens if absolutely all the traders out there used firebird and all of them made good chunk of money..............any idea?  
I don't see any reason why firebird can stop making pips, except for strong trends which you don't get all the time, but forex market is supposed to be a zero sum game, isn't it?  
I don't think such a thing as every single trader out there uses firebird can happen but I just wonder what if it happens. Any idea?

This is my first post on this site and I wanted to use it to thank you guys.   
  
It is amazing to see a group of people with a common goal to work so well together trying to improve something like this program. I just wish the people at my work could collaborate on anything half as well as you guys do.  
  
I am new to FOREX trading but have learned a great deal from listening to you guys, and hope that soon maybe I can help you guys make this a better program.

Raven, your "contribution" is welcomed, we are all in this together. I for one am not going away. I've been bitten by the bot. After looking at over 3000 pips in the four demo tests i ran from last Sunday there is no way i can shake the idea that down the road this is doable...even if that means we somehow intervene and choose the trade times!!  
  
Your comment on v1c "hardly does anything" i can state that when i opened 6 demo accounts last nite (first day of a new month for IBFX demo account holders), the 63G-TS and v1b2 were all in trades withing the first 15 minutes, but v1c took two hours before taking it's first trade. Does v1c need to get a feel for the state of the market before initiating trades? I don't think it has that sort of siphistication? I do know that after the trade day was over my v1c accounts on 1m & 15m charts were more profitable and had lower floats than the other two versions.

The only feel an EA has is looking at history.  
No need for it checkout what's happening.  
It can get an instant feel by using the historical data.  
In Firebird that means looking 10 bars back.  
So if the setup is right it will be instand execution. 

May the pips be with you.

It's simply not possible; and very easy to understand.  
If everyone would use the same system then everyone would get the same signals. If everybody got a 'go long' signal on EURUSD who would sell that lot to them? If everyone gets an exit long signal who would take their lots?  
Everybody is long.  
  
If every one has the same opinion the markets would show a flat line. 

May the pips be with you.

I ran four different tests on Firebird this week. The variables were: version, broker, number of pairs traded. As for Time Frame I used M1 except for v1.0b at North Finance where I used M15.  
The tabulated results are in the file attached.  
  

Two short consequences from the table data:  
  

  1. M1 Time Frame gives better results than M15,
  2. v63G-TS beats v1.0b in terms of Equity/Profit ratio.

My phrase "hardly does anything" doesnt really say a lot so having reviewed the accounts i can say that; with 63G, 1B1 and 1c all being activated and deactivated at the same times, for probely no more than 2 hours a day have made the following since the 18th Aug  
63G $1006 with a floating loss of $717 although this is on a SBFX ac that is still frozen from yesterday at about 13.40 so those figure may vary.  
1B1 $1532 float of $556  
1c $184 float of $275   
I wouldnt normally have posted these results as the timeframe i am able to get online at the moment is way to small, but i thought someone who is thinking about going live but works and does not want to leave the ea on while they are at work may be encourged by at least the 1B1 version that seems to still make a reasonable amount given its limited on time.  
I also noted that when switching on both 63G and 1B1 both start trading almost immediatly but 1c can take hours to trade if at all.

I think you should run the EA full time.  
I can understand you won't have it trading unattended.  
Maybe just configure it to open no new positions during your working hours?  
Assume Firebird takes a trade. But it moves slowly and by the time you go back to work again it's still not closed. What will you do? Shut down with live orders that don't get managed properly? 

May the pips be with you.

forex4syg,  
  
I read your previous post when you posted it. I just got caught up in some other things and forgot to respond.  
  
I agree, there will be times when there will be error 130 (Invalid stops) due to calculated StopLoss being too low. If sl value is too close to or between the spread, server will not accept order. If StopLoss=0, trade will process OK. A 3-5 pips buffer could be added to Stoploss to stop this error 130. At this point, it does not seem to adversely effect the performance of the EA. I'm not sure, but it might even prevent entry into questionable trades.  
  
Sorry for not responding sooner.

Hi FB Family  
  
After Interbank cleaned out their demo server last weekend I started all over. I am testing 5 versions, all with different settings. The champ is   
63G Fixed - 1M chart with MONO's different settings. I let it run through NFP - and it handled itself very effective.  
  
Perhaps it is not wise to look just at profit. I would rather settle for less profit if it would mean I could grow old with Firebird - my new friend!  
  
A version to watch closely is Wackena's vers1.0b2. I ran this one on a 5min chart. Also watch 63G-TS...  
  
I will post the updated spreadsheet every week.   
  
I am going live this week on a $4000 standard account trading 4 pairs on 0.1.

Benna, Your presentation is nicely detailed.  
If you did not mind, next week I would also use a similar spreadsheet. It would ease the comparison as well.

Hi Wackena,  
Thanks a lot for your work.  
I have noticed that when Stoploss is zero, there will be error in opening trade. Please correct me if am wrong. In the code, for example,  
OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,slip,Bid+(Stoploss*Point),Bid-(TakeProfit*Point),GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenSell); // modified by Renato  
If parameter Stoploss is zero (resulted from the daily iATR), then Bid+(Stoploss*Point) = Bid, it is the same as the sell price. The order will be prevented. I think this is the reason why some people noticed that in the version c, there may be less orders opened at the beginning. Good or not, I do not know.  
  
Do you have idea why daily ATR would even return zero?   
  
I also noticed that in trailing stop, the fixed pips of 5 (below Bid or above Ask) in StopLoss would fail for some platform, for example, with NorthFinance, the trailing stop often does not work well because of invalid stop.  
  
  
Thanks

The possibility, but not likely, is the mathematical average of High minus Low over previous 21 bars (days) = 0. More likely for error 130, ATR <5\.   
  
I use the 5 pips gap for setting new s/l in t/s modify orders in EAs. Most other t/s codes that I have seen, set new s/l at the present s/l below Bid for Buy order and above Ask for Sell order. This sets the first new s/l from t/s function very close to order entry price. If price reverses and triggers s/l, usually it is very low profit. So I changed it to a fix 5 pips. This way if t/s is trigger, s/l is set nearer actual price to take more profit on reverses.  
  
I haven't been monitoring for invalid stop as a result of this 5 pips gap. So far, on IBFX live and demo, FDXX demos and North Finance demos, this t/s function has worked very well for me.

I think it was on the other Firebird thread. Accrete has it on his Firebird resource page <http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/>

I may be cracking up, but isn't there more than one version of 1.0b ? More than one version of the hedged version? I have been running the "b" version.  
Thanks for any advice.

Yes, Wackena released v1.0b2 on 8/27. It replaced v1.0b He said it fixed the hedge problems.

I know some of you are thinking about going live in the next days.   
  
But, when I look at the daily and weekly charts, it seems to me that the market has been in congestion since mid-may, and the ATR's are at the lowest range. In september there will be probably increase of volume, so possibly beginning of new trend ?  
  
So, how does FB behave when there is a big trend like the one we had last April ?   
As far as I know, nobody was testing FB at that moment ?  
And in another thread here, SM01 said he ran detailed backtests, and he said that April trend ate all profits since January 2006.  
We all would love to see FB working well in all market conditions, but, given all the wonderful results we had, we really have to consider if this is not dur to some specific circumstances.  
  
Any feedback on this please ?

KingForex very true.  
Therein lies my big concern over going live with Firebird.  
Take cable for example. Price is historically quite high at the moment around 1.9000 and the market has been fairly flat for a while.  
Say we start a trend south and price moves 100 to 150 pips in a day. Firebird will buy every 20 or 30 pips depending on your setting.  
Would you close all trades? Of course not. You would expect price to reverse (just like after NFP) and give Firebird more winners.  
But what if price goes south _again_ the next day and keeps going. OK max trades limits buys to 10 trades per currency but some of us are using 5 to 7 pairs. So you have 10 buy orders that stop out at -300 over lets say 5 pairs. That will give you a total of -15,000 pips.  
It has happened many times before - ask Traderseven the author of the EA. I myself have tested 63g since March and twice all my profits (and more) have disappeared when a major trend started.  
So just be aware before you go live. The old Firebird weakness is still there waiting to bite.

It's funny how many posts for fireBird, here and on other forums.  
  
Is fireBird the dream come true? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
How many accounts did fireBird wiped out?  
  
Is fireBird worth the time and energy?

Mike,  
  
We should be sure to talk about the same, can you post the version you have testet since march ? I can´t imagine that actual firebird can´t handle a trending market, especially the Hedge Version should protect us from the big loosers... Are you sure you use a version near the actual ones ??  
  
Be honest mike, the old versions can kill you also in short trending markets also, we all know that, therefore you need no long run trend... (i remember testing V055, V065tf and same stuff) my oppinion V63G-TS works realy good also in smal trending markets because this version is opened often postitons in both directions and save profits with trailing stops...  
  
However, we should compare it, than we can say more about it...  
  
So please post the version you used in this time, also a statement if you have. you write it happends to you twice, when was the second time ??  
  
thank you,

Mr. Trader,  
Please find below my statement. A couple of qualifiers: From 8/22/06-8/26/06 I was running FB63H02. I began to get alot of "excessive alerts" even though I had commented out the line. When Wakena posted the updated version of 1b2, I switched to this on 8/27/06 and ran it all day Friday, 9/1/06 thru the NFP, until closing.  
  
You will also note that I have highlighted in yellow 5 losses on 8/29/06. This was user error on my part. I had closed out Metatrader on this account and when I re-opened it for some reason it defaulted to the FB63H02 with the default settings of TP 18 PIPS and SL of 42. I had set it prior to going to work and was in a hurry and didn't recheck it! Learned a good lesson there...always double check your settings!  
  
The other highlighted area in blue-green was the the Amazing EA that I used for trading the NFP on 9/1. Here is the statement below. Hope this helps.   
  
P.S.-Wakena, if your reading this, any ideas on why I can't seem to comment out the "excessive loss" line or any other alternatives in FBH02? I have also been getting this on occassion with FB1.b2.

nvwine, thanks for reminding ppl there is a resource page for firebird, all the most recent versions and forms/manual are at the link you posted:  
<http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/>. I don't know if it is possible for a moderator to ad this to one of the opening page's links, or if it is even desired to do so, but it would probably help the newbies out if it was centralized. I upload every new important document and file as soon as it hits this thread. : )

I don't know about a "Dream come true" but one of my handful of [FB demo test statements](http://www.accrete.com/fx-posts/eafb-statements/2006-08-31accrete-FBv1-0c1defaults.htm) shows a whopping 1275 pips for four trading days last week. The account was cleared out at midnight Thursday by IBFX due to end of month so i could not continue the test through NFP on the same account. Not to be thwarted, i opened up 6 demo accounts trading the G-TS, 1c, and 1b2 on both 1m and 15m charts. Each went through the news much better than i can imagine myself doing with each pulling off an average of 140 net chart pips for the day after the dust settled.   
  
I think it is worth the time. And i intend to work this until i know everything i can about the EA and it's personality. I also believe that combining TA with the EA will benefit one's account. For instance, if we know that FB gets hit hard during trending markets, what is to stop us from doing daily homework and doing our best to determin the trend/mode of the market and act accordingly tweaking the EA's functions such as only entering trades in the direction of the weekly trend or similar? Or staying out of EA use if market is ranging in a trade range that is greater than XXX pips??  
  
Just rambling, but i think that the combination of intellegent homework/TA and use of the FBea settings can yeild consistant profits.  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

I was just curious, what do you guys put for this setting? I have just backtested it with two different settings GMT=0 & GMT=-8 (Pacific Standard) and I get two different results. Which should it be?

You just gave me an idea for trying to add a bit of a safety net to firebird. Is there a way to program it so that it can look at daily Open/High/Low/Close and then disallow trading to take place based on a certain percentage of shift in these numbers? Use four days of timeframe and have it measure a cumulative percentage shift either up or down in price each day to see if there is a definite trend taking place to keep firebird out of a suicide play until the percentage of daily shift comes back to a certain level. Questions, comments, complaints?

I curreny pair dont just keep dropping without doing some trace. otherwise the drop would be a straight lone down on a chart..and this does not work that way. Now the hedge version would do nicely in such a trend.

A real live account with real cash?  
Just checking if it isn't a forward test.  
It looks good. But float is a bit high.

You're trading .10 lots on 11 (or was it 12) pairs **and gold (???)** , with only a $1000 account. Throughout the thread it's been said you need at least $1000 a pair to trade that size. That means you're underfunded by at least $10,000.   
  
At almost 50% of your balance, I believe that your float is high. No offense, but if the float is causing your anxiety, it seems entirely of your own doing. Maybe you like to gamble? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Even through all this, if you were to close all open trades at a loss, you'd still have made around $235 gain on your account. That's nearly 25% in only 21 days as of your statement. That, is nothing short of phenomenal - consider yourself very lucky.  
  
That may be what you should consider doing too. I'd like someone to verify that what I'm interpreting is indeed true, but it looks to me that you are only a few steps away from a margin call. If that happens, you'll end up wiping out all of your gain and probably losing a significant amount of your initial deposit.  
  
With your account size, you need to trade only one pair or .01 lots (if you can do that).  
  
There is one thing that I am puzzled about though. Your loss ratio seems abnormally high. What version are you using and with what settings?

Mono's post [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=289](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=89601&postcount=289) shows how. Just remember if full line of code takes up 2 lines in EA, each line needs to be commented out.

So many versions around but if you want to reduce the float a bit and not by just taking the loss I think it may be wise to change the trading times to 24hours a day not trading.  
That setting only works for completly new trades. So it still averages and manages your open trades in the normal fashion.  
If things go right you float will gradually be turned into profits.  
Setting TP=0 will speed up that process.  
  
But I can't say for sure because I don't know what exactly changed in the versions floating around. 

May the pips be with you.

Thanks Wackena,  
I think that is probably what I did...not having commented out both lines. I will try this and see if it takes care of the problem.

Niponzz,  
  
In addition to being in agreement with the other replies on your post regarding margin & pairs trading, you could also reduce your losses if you used Mono's setting of 300 for your stop loss. Some of your stop losses are only 42 pips, although I saw one at 200 pips. Taking all the suggestions noted in the posting replies, would help your heartburn. Good luck!

What you're suggesting sounds very similar to the safepipdistance fix that some versions contain.

Is there a way to program it so that it can look at daily Open/High/Low/Close and then disallow trading to take place based on a certain percentage of shift in these numbers? Use four days of timeframe and have it measure a cumulative percentage shift either up or down in price each day to see if there is a definite trend taking place to keep firebird out of a suicide play until the percentage of daily shift comes back to a certain level. Questions, comments, complaints?

I don't know what version did Mike test. I can say, like some people here, that I tested 63G last June, and it wiped out my account (please see statement if it can help). Hopefully, this cannot happen with current versions ?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Kingforex,  
  
In reviewing your statement, your SL=200 pips. Most if not all of your losses were closed out (manually?) prior to hitting the stop loss. It's hard to say how many of these would have gone on to be profitable if they had not been closed prematurely. Mono recommended a SL of 300 pips and this has worked great for me so far. Its also the general consensus from my reading that it is better to leave Firebird do its own thing 24 hrs/day, while of course keeping a close tab on things. This may explain why your account was wiped out.   
  
Anyone else have a thought on this?

We really would need to see with which version Miked traded sine March this year. I really hope that he shows us the EA he used and informs us exactly about the drawdown he had. If i am looking on charts of April it could be that there was a big drawdown. I hope Mike tells us which Version he used and maybe shows us an Statement. We definitevely can need this information in order to understand and analize Firebird better in trendtimes, and use this information to improve firebird than and make it safe for trend times. Firebird worked great the last 3 months but we were in sideway market. Well we see what Mike shows us.

Once this TA is up and running? or the news/analysis is found we can post the data for all users to utilize, maybe on a seperate thread for use as a FB-TA database/realtime TA discussion.  
  
Hollis, i liked your idea. i'm not familiar enough at this point, but am diggin in, to know if the pipstep setting is the answer as was posted above.  
  
Cheers,

LOL I had a good time with the original b as well. Not so impressed with the "fixed b". I am going to try and find the original b again.  
  
Traderone the original b was not opening hedge trades for every position as it should. Wackena fixed it and now its working as it was originally intended in version 1.0b2.

Yes, I have been demoing b2 but it has not made nearly the PIPS that the other versions have. Maybe it is safer though?  
  
I'm afraid that I feel the big September trends coming on. Haven't had one during the summer testing of FB. Should coincide nicely with starting my live Firebird account and completely wipe me out![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Going on two pair only (EURUSD and USDCHF) on a $4000 account and .1 lots each.  
  
Settings will be 25 TP, 15 pipstep, 250 SL for both pair.   
  
FB 63G on M1 charts.  
  
Actually I was considering running H02 with the same settings and a safe area of 40, but I have decided to go Original 63G.

However, i see in your statement you turned the SL down, never set them under 300... this system needs place to breath... my oppinion is that also this SL is t close, maybe take 400 - 450 pips for some pairs... But don´t forget, trade max. 0.1 lot per pair and also min 1k $ account volume per pair.  
  
**That means:** On a 5k $ mini account (1:200 leverage, better more) trade max 5 pairs with 0.1 Lot, than you should be protrected from Margin calls and too big losses ! Note, 70% of time market is ranging so firebird will perform well, with SL 400 - 450 pips you will also alive big trends. A good idea is also to have a bigger pipstep, my pipstep amount minimum steted as high as TP.  
  
Hope this helps,

just for your info our multi controlled test starts tonight on demo accounts.  
  
also the settings i am using on my own live account are this - two pairs only eurusd, usdchf - target is $1000 for the week and whenever +$1050 is reached in equity (if!) all trades will be closed and possibly started again after 6pm gmt.  
  
the extra $50 is to account for the time it takes to close multiple trades (which the expert will do automatically)  
  
if friday comes along before the $1000 and is in profit then the trades will be closed at around 9pm if it's still in loss then the state of the float will determine my plan.  
  
  
here's a question for you - if i left the positions open over the weekend but had to close and reboot the pc would this have an adverse effect?, ie would the experts pick up where they left off for the pipstep etc etc  
  
ps, my settings are:  
  
eur tp22 sl220, ps11  
  
chf tp25, sl250, ps 12  
  
yes it results in a lot of float and trades - but also lot of pips. would have to lose 900 this week for me to start going into the red.  
  
I'm starting to be a believer in closing all trades regularly, ie weekly - whilst this may limit profits over the long run it will also stop the large losses at all and keep the float manageable. Yes i know that equity always rules, but it's quite possible that even if you had say +4k in equity but 30 open trades that in an instant that 4k could dissappear - hense the need to keep not so much the level of float down but the number of possible full stop outs.  
  
I know there is coding for this but i'd rather seek a target and close all trades before either the number of trades or the size of float becomes a problem. - remember this is real money albeit only around 10k

I have let all my demos run all week and never stop them until Friday night. Turn off the machine. Start them back up on Sunday PM before the market opens and off they go. I don't shut down any trades. I have not encountered any ill affects on either FXDD or IBFX by doing this.  
  
Now to see how it works live.

My experience running several Firebird versions thru NFP and all other news events has been just fine.  
  
It is the big, steady trend one direction that worries me.

It depends on your broker. It would be OK on IBFX, but not FXDD for instance.

Sorry. Don't know anything (good) about North Finance. I'm sure if you ask them they will let you know.

The account was cleared out at midnight Thursday by IBFX due to end of month so i could not continue the test through NFP on the same account. Not to be thwarted, i opened up 6 demo accounts trading the G-TS, 1c, and 1b2 on both 1m and 15m charts. Each went through the news much better than i can imagine myself doing with each pulling off an average of 140 net chart pips for the day after the dust settled.

Or staying out of EA use if market is ranging in a trade range that is greater than XXX pips??

good point,  
  
Just a thought, when trend is forming we could close all trades opened in opposite direction and disallow opening position in opposite direction.  
  
Cheers.

>  In reviewing your statement, your SL=200 pips. Most if not all of your losses were closed out (manually?) prior to hitting the stop loss. It's hard to say how many of these would have gone on to be profitable if they had not been closed prematurely. Mono recommended a SL of 300 pips and this has worked great for me so far. Its also the general consensus from my reading that it is better to leave Firebird do its own thing 24 hrs/day, while of course keeping a close tab on things. This may explain why your account was wiped out.

Look at the Kingforex's statement, you will see many lossing orders were opened at almost the same time. I think the FB should avoid opening multiple orders with the same price at the same bar.

You cannot trade less than 0.1 lots at Northfinance. I dont think this EA would work well with them anyway -- too many requotes and dealing desk messages when the market is moving.

Hi Guys  
  
Sorry I cannot post results of my tests, due to a hard disk problem (trying to recover as much as possible, before I chuck it).  
  
Anyway, What I know so far.  
  
**Firebird 30-300 test  
  
**Started = 18th June  
Ended = 2nd September  
Pairs = eurjpy, eurusd, gbpusd, usdcad, usdchf, usdjpy  
Using Firebird v63G original (with divergence error)  
booked = 9870 pips  
float = -1503 pips  
Final result = +8367 pips  
  
**Firebird IND**  
  
Started = 31st July  
Ended = 2nd September  
Pairs = eurjpy, eurusd, gbpusd, usdcad, usdchf, usdjpy, audjpy, audusd, eurchf, eurgbp  
Using Firebird v63G Fixed  
booked = 16292 pips  
float = -5759 pips  
Final result = +10533 pips  
  
I have started a new hedge test and I'll be post results when I can. And I will create a Journal Thread to track my Live System and thoughts. I wont be posting statements, just updated spreadsheets.  
  
Cheers

I know there has been some talk about currency pairs to trade, and in that discussion TraderOne (?) brought up the idea of trading non-correlated pairs. There was a new thread posted tonight over [at this factory thread](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showthread.php?t=7460) where they mentioned [this correlation tool](http://fxlabs.oanda.com/cgi/fxlabs.pl?id=4). It looks interesting, and i've seen others. My question is, has anyone forward tested and observed enough pairs to give us a run down on using correlation/non-correlation from actual test results?  
  
I went ahead and turned on a test for each of the 5 main FB versions tonight and all seem to be doing their thing. The pairs that i have up, which unfortunately are correlated for the most part, are: USDCHF, EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURJPY, EURCHF, EURGBP, USDCAD, AUDUSD. Those are just the pairs that i've dabled with in live trading and none are what i would consider currencies that i've come to know other than the EURUSD over the past year. Since this is just a demo, i don't mind running them all this month and see what might work, but so much of what i feel any of us doing is duplication. It would have been nice to get some sort of list of tests we could volunteer for and keep track in a systematic fashion.(?)  
  
_Another PS. I just added two more demo-tests. Both w/version 1vc on the pairs above, but this time one account is only opening shorts, and the other longs. I want to see if there is any value in doing some TA and watching the general trend, maybe from daily charts, and setting the EA accordingly. Just a ramble and doodle. . . may not be worth the while, but who knows if ya don't try it out!_  
  
_PS: edit; I would volunteer to create such a list but don't have the knowledge of what to look for or what would make for an effective test! I'm just using the 5 standard versions as is on 1m charts w/IBFX. But if it helps the gang i will do whatever i can such as creating a master excel sheet of pairs and trades etc from the test results?? I'll sure do my part in any testing : )_  
  
Cheers, and have a nice holiday those in the US.

thanks.  
I'm narrowing my live FB to USDCHF. EURUSD and GBPUSD today, using the fixed version. Account up about 60% in one week so far.  
  
still grappling with what to do in a trending market. I think there should be enough daily ranges for FB to do OK in a trending market, but we could lower the TP and up the pipstep?

That's one way to think of it, but I'm in the camp of only allowing FB to take trades in the direction of the trend to make sure we make our "proper dollars", so to speak. This would keep us from bleeding green, which is mucho bueno. Now to try and get that one girl that's been eyeing me for the past few weeks...Where's the TA in that one?! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Greetings Mono. Just so i get my lingo down here (yes i've read from 1 to 662! and the original thread.)  
  
1) In reference to the above versions. Is the first the 63G (or i suppose it could also be the v1a aren't they basicaly the same?)  
  
2) The "Ind" stands for individual settings and would be the same as our version v1c? "C" for calculate?  
  
Thanks for the clarification.  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Accrete version 1.0 c is suppose to be same to the IND from MOno but it calculates the TP PIPSTEP and SL automatically. It is not fixed like the IND. Version 1.0a i essentially the fixed version of 63G. Hope this helps.

we need a good indicator of when a currency pair is moving from a ranging to a trending market, perhaps williams%. then we could select the EA for only the ranging pairs. or maybe just using our eyes and drawing higher highs and lower lows. but it's supposed to be automated innit?

over on the other forum strategybuilderfx there is thread about a daily breakout system which probably work good when the firebird does not.  
  
why can't you just run both systems at once?  
  
when market is sideways firebird will do good and breakout not. when in a nice trend the breakout will work good and firebird not.  
  
makes sense to me.  
  
trying it on demo right now.

I was using an EA with that system until summer started. I only like that system during heavy trends. I don't think I would run both systems all the time.  
My real hope is one of the versions of Firebird with the correct settings or modifications will handle trends. Near break even or small loss performance in trends would be fine do to the great performance Firebird achieves the rest of the time.  
I might PM you in a few days about the other system. I don't want to get this thread off track.

Greetings all.   
  
Yardie; Thanks for the reply. Good info. I think that our resource page needs the "IND" version, so if someone wants to email it to me or post the post # i'll get it on [our resource page](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/)?  
  
cgldsmth,HAGeek,nvwine...yaya. I think this train of thought/experimenting could yeild profits.  
  
Question on v1c code: Scrolling down inside the code i see that each pair listed has an OpeningHours and ClosingHours set to i'm thinking the actual market of that pair. Does the global OH/CH settings, that i now have set to 0/24/running all day, override the individual pair's OH/CH settings? Or are these pointing to different chores (i think that is the wrong word, but you get the idea?)  
  
Thanks in advance.  
Cheers,  
Thom

hi,  
i am testing firebird with mono's setting and default-setting, and i see good result with large float. I think it' s possible find a time-zone in which EA con operate with stable result. We can considerate a couple of indicator to identify trend-market or manage (closing) the highest loss-orders after n-days without "tear up" the equity line.  
  
regards

it' s possible, but i think it is not the better solution, because we must protect the equity line. My idea is to accept loosing-trades to maintein a stable profit. In fact, in my tests EA collects only positive-trades.

Yes, I suppose so, I haven't checked or used the one's the guy's have created. I tend to fix my own version.  
  
I've attacted them on the bottom, the fixed version settings for divergence is in pips. (so a setting of 20, is the same as a 0.0020 for non jappy pairs and 0.20 for jappy)

Traderone,  
  
I have used 63H02 on a demo account for 16 trading days for an average return of 234 pips/day. My settings are Mono's 30TP, 300SL, .05 percent, with a Safe area of 40. This was starting with a $5000 account. I have gradually increased my lot size starting with .1 lots and increased lot size up to .3 based on their overall profitability and lower float. I will continue to do this as the equity increases and see wher it takes me. I use V. 1b2 on my live account but it carries a higher float. I may switch it to the 63H02 depending on how the accounts do next week. Also, I trade the 4 majors + Eur/JPY. Again, I will be evaluating these and may drop one or two.

A good idea is also to have a bigger pipstep, my pipstep amount minimum steted as high as TP.

Kingforex stated in recent post that he did not manually close out the trades, but all of the trades were closed prematurely, probably for the reason stated above...they were probably margin calls...

Traderone,  
  
Even in a steady trend there are always retracements as it works its way up or down. Probably the hedging version will work best in this market. We will all just have to experiment and go with the flow and make adjustments with the market. Happy trading!

I don't have the slightest clue of how to program this, but here's my idea for detecting a trending market in regards to firebird. Have firebird look at the past 96 hours in one hour increments and have it compare the highest high vs the lowest low. To get the answer to the question of if we're in a trend or not, we have FB compute the percentage change in over all price between the high and low. If the cumulative total is say +.75% from ninety six hours ago, firebird goes into silent mode not placing trades until the percentage differential comes back down to say .5%. If the largest deviation occurs in less than say thirty six hours, we let firebird roam, but if the deviation is taking place and growing between thirty six to ninety six hours, we have firebird dive again until the time is right to surface. This is obviously just a rough sketch so far, so please do give some opinions on the idea.

BurgerKing, i know your question is sincere...but i almost fell off my chair laughing. This thread has so many versions you've just got to laugh! Trust me i'm laughing with you on this. The [FB resource page](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/) has all the latest versions including those that mono just posted above.  
  
Hope this helps a bit and you are smiling : )

Hi all. I don't know how any of your testing went today, but wow, what an eye opener for me. EURJPY really nailed the ol'demo test today. Several trades were stopped out and closed for -150 pips each. I am wondering if there might be a way to let the hedges run the distance? Or maybe i mised this thought/post and it's been discussed before?  
  
What would happen if there were a trailing stop placed in the hedge version on both trades? I have no idea if i'm even thinking proper, but one might think that moving the hedge by XX pips each XX pip move against the original entry would help with some of the losses. . . then basicaly this system might include some sort of stop and reverse type intellegence. . . if all this is lame, just write it off as the rambles of a guy who spent the holiday looking at charts and currency books.

Hi Accrete,  
  
I still think the main issue concerning v1.0b2 version is that it places market orders so one half of the hedge always remains. Mainly in trending market the remaining half causes heavy float then losses in worse cases, I mean if the trend is strong.  
  
My earlier posts regarding this issue where I detailed my idea:  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfo...3&postcount=510](http://showpost.php?p=92213&postcount=510)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfo...5&postcount=522](http://showpost.php?p=92565&postcount=522)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfo...6&postcount=525](http://showpost.php?p=92576&postcount=525)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfo...1&postcount=535](http://showpost.php?p=92811&postcount=535)  
  
My point is that pending orders would be more advantageous than market orders because this way the EA would put orders only to the trend direction.

Seeing that a lot of people are "interested" in firebird. I dont think that all you people in here are in to firebird for nothing, so I decided to jump in.  
  
I dont know what firebird's logic is; I sure appreciate if there is a text describing what firebird's strategy is..

Go to Accrete's resource page. There is a good document there.  
  
It is good to know how the EA that you risk your hard earned money on actually works.

for my 1.0c demo account it was the same with usd/jpy today and last week eur/jpy had a lot of losses. maybe the settings in 1.0c are not the best for JPY? on my live account 63G-TS i had today 2 usd/jpy trades and they were winners. however i dropped the JPY pairs from my live acc.

I been reading the posts about possible changes to the v1.0b (Hedge) EA.   
  
Attached is v1.0b3 with following changes.  
  
1\. UseHedge- If=true, the hedge order is placed when pipstep step order is triggered. Separate inputs for HedgeTakeProfit & HedgeStoploss.  
if=false, EA is v1.0a.   
  
2.UseDayClose- If true, CloseLoosingTrades subroutine is activated to close loosing orders below input LossLevel on DayClose (0-sun, 1=mon, 2=tues, 3=wed, 4=thurs. 5=fri) and DayHour (LocalTime). For those that want to close loosing orders on Friday or before news events. To close all orders, LossLevel should be 5 pips above TakeProfit or HedgeTakeProfit setting (whichever is highest).  
  
3\. OpenOrders- Max open orders per currency pair. To trade as v1.0a, set this to 10.

Forgive me, my english is not so very good. I'm a newbie and admire this method very very much. I have tested FBv63G fixed and 1c.  
  
My problem is that the TP is not the same even set at 30:  
  
eg: AUD/USD take profit at 11 pips  
EUR/JPY take profit at 17 pips  
GBP/USD take profit at 23 pips.  
  
I have been searching from prebious pages for the solution but just can not find one. Anybody recall the page, pls let me now.

If your talking about 1.0C it is made to set TP on its own. The first post of the thread gives a general idea.

I had the exact same problem (actually it's not a problem) before.  
With 1c versions, TP, SL and pipstep are overwritten by the EA. I think it obtains these settings from the daily average ranges of each currency pair.  
Thus, it is totally expected and normal.  
If you prefer different settings, you'd have to go with other version of firebird.

Thank you, spartan.  
If I understand you correctly, the TP will be changing everyday according to daily average ranges, am i right?  
  
If I want to be fixed, what shall i do?  
  
Thanks again.

Wondering if we ought to start another thread related to this, or if perhaps it's too broad a subject to bother covering within the parameters of the Firebird EA...  
  
But the question is, how are we going to spot the big nasty trend? We all know it's coming, and that it is going to do serious damage to our Firebird accounts. This situation reminds me of watching those shows about killer asteroids... ;-) Except in our case, I think we can expect this scenerio to occur once or more within the next several months.   
  
With all that in mind, I am hoping to start a discussion specifically aimed at protecting our Firebird accounts from the "big nasty".   
  
Here is what I've observed so far:  
Through back testing, as well as a fundamental understanding of what it takes to "obey" a system, I do not condone closing trades early or arbitrarily closing everything on Friday. None of the testing I've done indicates this is a good procedure. I've tried closing everything weekly and monthly, but both yeild significantly less profit, and not much less in the way of loss. The manual intervention I've had the most success with consists of simply turning Firebird off occasionally and letting the floating trades play themselves out.   
  
But all this is a bit "nebulous" for my taste. We have a concrete ruleset in place of executing trades (obviously), so it would be great to have set rules pertaining to the management of Firebird in general. Perhaps trading pairs should be individually shut down when a certain fib level is reached, or when a particular candlestick pattern is observed on the daily chart. Anyone else working on ideas in this direction?

Thanks Wackena, i have the v1b3 up at the site along with the text of your post 690 to help explain things. I think that i might try to compile some sort of similar info for each of the other versions and have a similar link. might help a bit. I'll have to dig into b3 and understand more of what it is doing. Thanks again : )  
  
All links seem to be working. One thing on the manual, the original was in a word doc type format, but it will open fine in I.E. for me and others.  
  
sim31; good thoughts/ideas. I was doodling w/BBands during todays session and doing some back studies to see a correlation if any. I've been into BBs for about 9months. . . as nice as they might be, they are still just an indicator. It would be nice to be able to trade this thing naked as far as TA goes or some sort of BWILC median. With the catastrophic 300 pip S/L FB reminds me of BWILC to some degree if one was using a non hedge version and trading only with the fundamental, or longer term trend of a pair. Just rambling. But then with a more flowing hedge possibility, why not try to lessen the blow of not getting the entry pip-on?  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

I think in "nasty trends" a useful combination would be placing two (one sell and one buy) pending orders when pipstep order is triggered. This would function as a breakout system utilizing one of the two pending orders (and liquidating the other at the same time) and leaving to run with the trend.  
This system would be able to handle trend changes as well.

On the hedge functions, I'm assumeing that the HedgeTakeProfit is just that, again a preset of XX pips, be it 30 or whatever if price goes in direction of hedge. And the HSL is for breathing room of the hedge? But what if a trailing stop that moves the hedge to break even after XX pips, then trails the hedge at the user defined setting such as you have above were possible? If one had been available in today's example of the EURJPY, if a trailing stop of 30 to 35?? had been set one could have picked up quite a few pips on the hedge side?  
  
The rambles of a non-coder that needs to learn how to code!  
: ) Thom  
  
**PostScript Ramble and question in relation to a possible hedge version tweak(?):** Is there a way that (sorry for repeating myself) the trailing stop can bring the S/L to say entry +X pips (maybe even just 1 or 2 pips into profit so there will be no chance of a loss at that point?), then once the price continues in the direction of the trade it is then moved by the trailing stop setting?

I just run v63G and working fine. Suddenly I deicdec to rearrange the currency pairs. So I closed all manually. Then rearrange the currency to only 4 pairs. (previously 6 pairs).  
  
Suddenly no order were pick-up till now. It has been more than 12hrs already. Where did I go wrong...?

It seems like the last few pages of the thread has focused on the 63G versions. I've got a test running comparing 1c1 to 1b2. I have the same pairs/settings for each and it seems like the 1c1 version did a much better job both logging pips and keeping float down. Today alone I logged 455 pips on 1c1 vs 300 pips on 1b2. I think it has to do with the auto TP and SL calculations on 1c1 getting you out of trades sooner.  
  
So, my question is, is it now recommended to not use these versions and go with the 63g versions? Or, is it just that we haven't heard recently from those people (with the exception of Chad and the new 1b3 posts) working on the 1b2 and 1c versions?

I have no idea if i'm even thinking proper, but one might think that moving the hedge by XX pips each XX pip move against the original entry would help with some of the losses. . . then basicaly this system might include some sort of stop and reverse type intellegence. . . if all this is lame, just write it off as the rambles of a guy who spent the holiday looking at charts and currency books.

Thom,  
  
It's strange that you got stopped out on your JPY pairs, while almost all of mine cleared out and went to profit. I only have two EUR/JPY pairs that are about mid-way in the minus pips + a couple JPY pairs that were entered today. This reduced my float in all three of my accounts, 2 demo, one live.

Accrete, et al  
  
As I _also_ said before, I agree with this approach and think it's worth pursuing with V1.0b2. Maybe we could call it V 1.0b3.   
  
I also have another thought on this but with an earlier version. Hendrick in post #258 & #260 @ [http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...d-v63g-26.html](http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advisors-metatrader-4/2176-firebird-v63g-26.html) created Firebird v63H (with a correction in post 260) to v63H02. This may have also been posted @ FF as well, but I don't know where. Anyway, as is explained in the post quote:  
  
**"This setting is based on the idea that Firebird is doing well in a flat market, but could go wrong when the market gets volatile. The indicator (Firebirdv63H_IND) gives you an idea how this function works (you don’t need to attach this indicator to your charts for Firebirdv63H to work). The indicator is quite simple: it takes the values of the built-in indicators “ Bulls Power” and “ Bears Power” and adds them together. When these powers are in balance it’s safe to trade. When Bulls or Bears get the upper hand their sum crosses a certain level (until now I think levels of 40 and -40 works well) and Firebird isn’t allowed to place trades."**  
  
My understanding of this is that its' purpose is to prevent trades in volatile markets. My idea is to use this idea in conjunction with V1.0b2 while combining it with hedging orders but leaving them as pending orders to be cancelled once the trend is established. The "Safe Area" prevents orders during volatility and the "pending orders" go with the trend and are entered or their hedges are cancelled.   
  
Any thoughts on this. Anyone willing to program something like this...? Wakena, what do you think?

P.S. V 63H02 as well as the Firebird Safe Indicator are posted on the above web site.

I also forgot to note that I use 63H02 in one of my demo accounts started on 8/15 with $5000. It has almost doubled and today has a float of $488. It has been the most profitable of my three accounts with the lowest float.

To All,  
Didn't mean to lend confusion to the above post. I had not read through the whole thread and didn't realize that v1.0b3 had been posted. How about v1.0b4?

Thanks for your report 1Trader2. I too had good success with FB H02, even with somewhat changed settings similar to Mono's IND settings.  
  
However, this morning I still went live with FB v1.0a with slightly modified settings on two pair only. Still, I'm thinking H02 might be even better.

I'm running v1c1 too and not doing that well, yesterday with U/J and Today with G/U. Float on G/U approaching 700 pips right now.  
  
What are your settings, Stockwet?  
  
My settings are 0.1% on 30 min chart (changed from 1m chart last night).  
Are you doing anything vastly different from other people here?

Maybe I spoke to soon. I woke up today and found some pretty serious negative float on 1c. Here's what I'm testing:  
  
eurusd, 1m, .05%  
usdchf, 1m, .05%  
eurjpy, 1m, .07%  
eurgbp, 1m, .07%  
eurchf, 1m, .1%  
usdcad, 5m, .1%  
audusd, 5m, .1%  
  
I like the concept of having these on higher timeframes, so, I might start a test on 15m charts. I haven't analyzed which pairs are performing best/worst, yet. I don't think the last couple of days have been normal conditions, particularly with the EUR.   
  
Also, I couldn't find the H02 version. Can someone point me to it, or, did I miss a post somewhere?  
  
Thanks.

I was testing Firebird V1c so far there are losses so I am not that impressed, even though my testing isn't complete I don't like its behavior. Mono would you please be so kind as to post your settings and the version of firebird you are using so I can continue testing . Appreciate your diligence.

Thank you for posting your settings, Stockwet.  
I don't know how common it is but my float on G/U has exceeded 800 pips.  
I wonder how are people running hedge versions of firebird doing last couple of days.

I would encourage you to find his previous posts for those. He always put his setting file and the firebird he is using when he post his statements.

I heard there were concerns using GBPUSD aand USDJPY with this, so, I avoided those. I tried EURJPY just for fun.

I was using vc1 as well and found that the last two days profit has been waaay down... Previously when I used FB I had noticed that the stop losses were large at say around -200.. Now I am noticing that they are much tighter.. Could this be the reason there are more losses as of the last few days or simply because of market volatility?

Yup, i'm thankful. After last week's outstanding pinch-me-ive-found-the-holy-grail experience w/all the FB version tests, there is a week like this that shakes the heavens and places one's feet back on terra ferma. I am also thankful that the good news came to me first, as i believe that there great potential in EA trading. And if this week's performance had been my first taste of bot trading, it could have been my last!  
  
So bottom line? I'm a happy camper and am enjoying the time w/the charts, code, and experience gained. Back to the testing.

That's a smart move you made. I have been thinking it's kinda too chicken to avoid the currency pairs after only one failure but I'm gonna drop them right away! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I think it is...it would have been nice if we were trading with the trend last couple of days.

I started testing firebirds 3 days ago and so far the first taste has been quite bitter!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)   
I would consider this somewhat lucky that it did not happen after I started trading live though. Thanks to all the contributors to firebird, I know it can do a lot better.

First, thanks to Spartan for the version. I had glance through it and found the set-up is quite different from other FB version.   
  
Tradeone,  
What are the difference H02 with other FB version. I have glance through the pages but just can't find the info, thanks in advanced.

H02 has a "safe zone" area determined by Bulls and Bears. Default is 40. It won't trade if the price is out of the "safe zone". Might help on trending markets.  
  
Hey there fingotrader and spartan and some others..... the first week I demoed FB 63G I had negative equity of over 1200 pips! Now, 2 weeks later, the account is up 2600 pips. This is automatic trading and I think we have to let the EA get seated in to its' bands etc.  
  
Also, get rid of the JPY pairs right now! Also get rid of EURCHF and EURGBP. Don't mess with those. We haven't really found good settings for them yet.  
  
Trade these.... USDCHF, EURUSD, USDCAD. That way you can bump up your lots slightly and put your money where the best chance of action is.

I picked EURGBP and EURCHF because it was recommended to trade non-correlated pairs. If you trade USDCHF and EURUSD, you have a pretty high correlation and might as well double up on one or the other.

Thanks for your advice, Traderone.  
That's exactly what I was going to do...trading only those three pairs to see how it works out since they are the ones most people don't have much problem with.  
  
The result of my firebird demo trading after 2 and a half days has been:  
  
firebird v1c1 0.1% on 30 min chart(changed from 1 min chart 1 day into this test) ---- 24 win-1 loss 121 pips booked with about $1000 of float loss(0.1 lots)  
  
firebird v63-ts 30-300-30, 0.1% on 1 min chart --- 8 win-0 loss 240 pips booked with about $800 of float loss (0.1 lots)  
  
Please note that I got disconnected from the server a couple of times...and also I had forgotten to turn on the EA a couple of times for unknown amout of time so my data may not be that accurate and fair.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Greetings All : ) Great to be here among you all. Don't even want to imagine trying to come up with this on my own. I migh be able to [build wild and crazy bikes](http://accrete.com/p-tgl/hpv/index.htm), but this stuff here really stretches my noggin'.   
  
Don thx for the info on "H" and the reminder of possible best pairs for FB to date. Next Sunday, along w/my gazillion FB demos running, (ok, so there are _only_ 8 seperate MT4demo accts running 8FB versions on my laptop), i am going to include one w/H02 cuz my desktop is feeling left out. The idea of the safe zone interests me. This might help out answering some of the Qs in prior posts about determining when fb should trade as you mentioned also.

All my profits made by firebird starting august are wiped out today at IBFX.(by floating loss)  
Anybody else today? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1)   
  
Another account at FXDD is working as it should.  
Just a small setback.  
  
Can't believe what a small difference in spread and feed can do to it.  
So we keep on dreaming the FB dream....

Hendrick in post #258 & #260 @ [http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...d-v63g-26.html](http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advisors-metatrader-4/2176-firebird-v63g-26.html) created Firebird v63H (with a correction in post 260) to v63H02. This may have also been posted @ FF as well, but I don't know where. Anyway, as is explained in the post quote:  
>

The indicator (Firebirdv63H_IND) gives you an idea how this function works (you don’t need to attach this indicator to your charts for Firebirdv63H to work). The indicator is quite simple: it takes the values of the built-in indicators “ Bulls Power” and “ Bears Power” and adds them together. When these powers are in balance it’s safe to trade. When Bulls or Bears get the upper hand their sum crosses a certain level (until now I think levels of 40 and -40 works well) and Firebird isn’t allowed to place trades."**

My idea is to use this idea in conjunction with V1.0b2 while combining it with hedging orders but leaving them as pending orders to be cancelled once the trend is established. The "Safe Area" prevents orders during volatility and the "pending orders" go with the trend and are entered or their hedges are cancelled.

Trends are here I have no doubt about that. Both EURUSD and GBPUSD are bearish and there is no Firebird version that would be able to handle this phenomenon in a profitable way.  
  
I run five tests with different Firebird versions, different pairs and brokers and all of them show the same symptoms: increasing floating loss, decreasing or hardly increasing balance. I have even booked my first losing trade today.  
  
I still think **applying pending orders rather than market orders** when hedging and **liquidating half of the hedge pair** when the other half initialised is a possible resolution of trading a trend with Firebird. I hope this suffering of Firebird focus the attention of the programmers to trend managment.

For those of you testing and need some computing resources ...  
  
I signed up with VPSLand.com for a virtual private server late last week. I installed 4 instances of MetaTrader and have 3 firebird versions being tested on each one. You can connect using Windows XP's remote desktop connection. The first month is half off of $30. I figured it was a cheap way to get constant connectivity and free up a computer while testing the EA. I thought others might benefit from this info.  
  
Regards,

I have been testing firebirdind for 3 days with a U$5000 demo account. I have U$200 profit, but also - 1200 float orders. Some orders are open since day 1. The question is: will these float orders close someday?

I started testing 4 versions of FB just a couple of days ago. I wanted to get a feel for it by watching it. I was not going to post the results, because I did not use the exact same settings on each on and it's only been a couple of days. But, I'll go ahead and post what I have so far. You can do with it what you will.  
  
63G-TS - 1m charts on USD vs GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF/CAD/AUD and EUR/JPY  
1a1 - 1m charts USD vs GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF/CAD and EUR/JPY  
1B2 - 1m charts USD vs GBP/EUR/CHF/CAD/AUD  
1c1 - 1m charts USD vs GBP/EUR/JPY/CHF/CAD and EUR/JPY  
  
All accounts were opened this past Sunday, 09/03 and started running roughly when markets opened (some were within a couple of hours after). Not much rhyme or reason as to why I chose those pairs, just wanted to experiment a little.

yeah, it will close if it reached the t/p or s/l. and the worse case would be margin call.

Is there any profitable version of firebird? The float orders in all version that I tested is the double or triple than the profit. Why this?

FB can work but its brutal during sustained long term trends as we just witnessed. I am referencing version v1.oc...  
  
Now I understand the newer version v63HO2 is safer with currency pairs such as GU or any currency pair for that matter which is trending long term. What I found out today through experimentation was that you can apply the different versions of FB to the charts which you have open.. So what I did was apply the v63HO2 version to cable and cable only.. The other pairs I am using the v1.oc ver.  
  
In this way it is safer or at least it would appear.. FB did quite buying the cable which was what I needed to accomplish. Its too early to tell the overall affects of this manouver.  
  
When you say FB is hedging which version are you referring to ?

Guys, have somebody any longer experience with version 63GH02 ???   
I trade live account and like the low float of this EA... Moreover this version has a protection mode in stronger trends, like GBP/USD today... He saved much floating to me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I have been following this thread from the start and wanted to add my results to the mix. I started v1.0c1 on 9/1/06. I know, nfp day, but since the consensus was not much of a deviation I thought I would give it a try. I started with 3 pairs, the 30-300-30 setting with money management, all mini lots, eur/usd, usd/chf, and usd/jpy, but for some reason the ea would not open a jpy order no matter what the deviation. Anyway, the results:  
  
9/1/06 Starting bal - $3055.13  
Ending bal - $3182.68  
eur/usd 87 pips  
usd/chf 50 pips  
Total pips - +137  
Had 5 open orders for 139 pips, 4 negative and 1 positive  
My gross profit was $127.55  
My net profit was $56.83 or 45% which isn't bad. I wish my company made 45% profit on each sale, I'd be a billionaire by now.  
  
No trades closed on Monday due to the holiday.  
  
9/5/06 Starting bal - $3182.68  
Ending bal - $3290.34  
I added the usd/cad and deleted the yen as no orders were being opened even though there was good movement on the yen. Does anyone know why this would happen?  
  
Pip totals - eur/usd +48  
usd/chf +58  
usd/cad +14  
Total pips - +120, not bad for 1 day I would say.  
Gross profit so far - $235.21  
  
9/6/06 Starting bal - $3290.34  
Ending bal - $3381.16, added gbp/usd  
  
Pip totals - eur/usd +32  
usd/cad +57  
  
Total pips - +89  
Gross profit - $326.03  
Open orders - -$72.60  
Net for 3 days - +$249.83 on mini lots. Go to full lots and you're looking at $2500 for 3 days for doing nothing. I could live with that. I just wanted to share my tests with everyone.

yardie, I ran a few backtest to assure EA wa placing orders as intended. I did not produce reports. In these tests, the hedge option did improve results on eur/usd and gbp/usd. My FDXX demo froze up and I had to reload EA. For some reason the history data now is corrupt. I will update history data and run off a few reports.

I do have a Q on the settings. I'm using Mono's settings also [see below for a paste of them if you need them]. Under the pip step area, did you testers lower to match in that area also? (I did, not knowing any better. grin). Also, how about the stop loss setting? In the "H" version it comes default at 42 pips? Is that right? Again, due to my lack of knowledge on this one, i just went ahead and changed the S/L default up to the larger IND settings as shown below. I am only testing the top four currencies.

Accrete,  
  
I have run v63H02 for about a month with Mono's settings of 30-300-30, but when I saw his post on his latest results with the individual settings either on this thread or the original thread, I thought about doing what you are now doing. I think that this will give us the best combination of profit and protection. I will be switching to IND for the pairs I trade live (the 4 majors & EUR/JPY) and will let everyone know how it goes.

I setup v1.0c1 to go live on a small account last night and had some promising results for its first day.   
  
I am trading this version on three pairs (EUR/USD, USD/JPY, & USD/CHF).  
  
The only change that I made to the default settings was to change the Percent variable to 0.025. I had done a bit of backtesting and found this number to be very profitable. It places the orders fairly close together and seems to raise the odds of them hitting the T/P number.  
  
Today's (9/6/2006) Record  
  
19 Wins and 0 Losses  
Total Booked Pips = 238  
Total Floating Pips = -140  
  
So basically it is a +98 Pip day. Not bad for a first day.  
  
Tightening the band by using the smaller percent setting of 0.025 seems to also act as a bit of a hedge as their seems to be a nice balance of orders set on each side as the small swings happen.  
  
I will post an update on tommorrows progress.

Thanks for sharing the info on the VPS. I am sure a lot of people would be interested in this.  
I had seen your post in other thread before and got interested in it but I found that the RAM on the VPS isn't that much. If you buy a puter now, you would not put only 320mb of RAM on it for sure.  
Is there any reason why it is ok to have only so much RAM on the VPS?  
Please let me know. Thanks!

You seem to have a really good result with your settings. That's impressive in that your float isn't that high for the profit you are making.  
What's the time frame you are using?

Altapowder,  
Waiting for your promising result and see green pips..  
  
Anyway what is the difference between v1.0c and v1.0c1. If possible do you mind to attach the EA for v1.0c1.  
  
Tq.

I left it at the default 30 minute period. An I set a max of 30 open orders, hoping I could contain the float.  
  
Today was only the first day so we will see how it goes.

I honestly do not know the difference. I found it at this link.  
[http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...a-archives.htm](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives.htm)  
  
I was origionally testing the v63G-TS version but found through a little backtesting and seeing some of the results that were posted before that it can have a pretty high float. Dropping the percent setting on version c1 seems to put the orders close enough together that it gives you a good shot at knocking multiple orders out on a good swing.

mmmmm - my comment about hedging with 63G was along these lines, the EA setting up multiple trades either side of the price. I've been using percent 0.05 so maybe this variable is key, since a smaller rtetrace will activate the EA to place the "hedge" order.   
  
of course have to keep an eagle eye on margin and MM with this. I'm trading 3 pairs.  
  
nice work Altapowder

Altapowder,  
  
I had imagined that you'd have buys and sells alternately with your settings without having many positions stay open too long.   
Isn't that even more vulnerable than other settings in case of a strong trend?   
  
Did you set the MaxOpenOrders at 30? If that's the case, I think it will open up to 30 orders per currency pair. Is that what you intended?  
  
My result 3 full days into demo trading firebird is:  
  
v1.0c1 23-1 121 pips booked with $900 in float loss (0.1 lots)  
v63-TS 12-0 360 pips booked with $700 in float loss (0.1 lots)  
  
Currently I use the major 4 plus USD/CAD and AUD/USD.  
One thing I noticed now is that with v1.0c1 I have only one win and a loss (of 236 pips) with about $700 in floating loss on GBP/USD, whereas with v63-TS I have 4 wins with no loss and about $600 in floating loss.  
  
It seems that GBP/USD pair has a tendency of going one direction for several hundred pips many times a year. Looking at 4-hour chart reveals a good example of this - a hike of 1,600 pips in about a month from April to May this year.  
Like someone is doing, going with conservative setting or using a more conservative version for this pair may make more sense...but with a bit modified setting such as 50-300-50, or maybe 50-2000-50? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) Just kidding but it looks like it definitely deserves a different setting from other pairs'.

Well, they have to share RAM among clients. But, it's not like it's my work computer, so, I don't have a whole lot of apps running. I have 4 instances of MT4 up and running and it's using just over half the RAM with all the other processes going.  
  
If you want full hardware resources, look into dedicated hosting, but expect to pay 3 or 4 times more.

Thanks for the info!  
I was just concerned since we are so used to seeing like 1GB or 2GB of RAM on new puters of today.

I guess it is critical that you start out trading firebird at the right time. I almost pulled the trigger and started trading live, instead of demo, but I'm glad now that i didn't.  
  
It'd be nice to get ahead of the game by 1,000 to 2,000 pips before seeing first loss if sl is set at 300.  
  
Update on my demo as of now (3 days and 8 hours)  
  
v1.0c1 26-4 -553pips with floating loss of $1,200(0.1 lots)  
v63-TS 13-1 +90 pips with floating loss of $1,600(0.1 lots)  
  
Well, I guess bad things DO happen to the best of EA's! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

It is a sad day. I shut off Firebird on my live account about 2 hours ago. I should have shut it off at the end of last week. Well this is when I'm glad for micro lots! If things reverse now I have enough float to continue earning till next week some time. I am still ahead but if the US dollar continues to roll I'll have to close everything to still have my starting stake.  
  
My best demo is V1.0a with PipStep=50.

I feel for you, Humax. That sucked big time!  
I hope that GBP/USD will somehow rally 300 pips soon.

I'm only trading eurusd audusd usdchf and usdcad but still got hammered by todays move. My profit on live account is almost double after 2 weeks but float is now near 40% and margin level about 150%. I fear a margin call is on its way.

Hi,   
  
I though to give my sentiments too while watching my EA (Firebird v63g_fixed with variable settings) having major losses. Just started testing my demo account 2 days ago with $5000 - now having 5700 balance and -$2500 floating balance. Sinceraly hope there will be some way to turn this to a better EA.   
  
Per aspera ad astra.  
  
nchosen  
  
forgot to mention that a margin call was also hit.

The biggest loser for me is the gbp/usd. My 3 big open orders. I should have payed attention to the ea instructions which clearly states DO NOT trade the gbp/usd! I added the nzd/usd yesterday to see how it goes. This is a different account and I'm running v63g-ts. So far the results were good except for the gbp.

I too began Firebird v1.0a this week (Tuesday).  
  
I am fortunate I think in that I am only trading EURUSD and USDCHF on somewhat more conservative settings than some. Pipstep 16 rather than 12 and percent.1.  
  
I am now in negative, but since I traded only .1 lot per 2000 account I still have decent margin levels. I think when starting a new EA it doesn't always go your way so it is good to be a little conservative, especially at first.  
  
Not happy about my losses but I'm going to ride for awhile and see.  
  
Here's an interesting fact.... my hedge (version b2) demo on 4 pair (NO GBPUSD) has lost very very little at all. Holding its own. So perhaps it might be a more useful "all weather" EA than I had thought.  
  
Is anybody running H02 through this storm? How is it doing?

GBPUSD should be banned for firebird. If we look back at the 1hour and 4hour chart, there is no way 300pip sl can withstand the movements.  
GBPUSD is good pair for trendfollowers, a killer for who goes agains it.  
I was aware of this, but greed got in the way....

Besides the fact I was stuuuuuuuuuuupid and got hurt by the gbp, fb v63g-ts still closed 3 orders so far today for +103 pips, 2 trailing stops and one tp. I love the trailing stop on this ea.  
  
Did I say 3? I should have said 4 orders for a total of +153 pips!

Just reviewed my demo of the hedge 1b2 and actually it has lost nothing today, just slightly up on 4 pair. Hmmmm. I might have to seriously reconsider this EA version for long term trading plans. does not win as wildly as others, but obviously does not lose as much in trending times. Worth hard look I'd say.

Nothing fancy. There the old settings of TP 30, SL 300, PIPSTEP 30. Probably nowhere near optimum.  
  
Pairs are EURUSD (net 346 pips since Aug28)  
USDCAD (net 151 since AUG 28)  
USDCHF (net 258 since Aug28)  
AUDUSD (net 54 since Aug 28)  
  
I think perhaps the TP should be slightly lower on USDCAD and AUDUSD).  
  
Not shabby.

Not shabby? Those numbers look good as long as your open orders aren't excessive. I have considered just trading the eur/usd and usd/chf. These 2 seem to be the most profitable now. I have also considered just closing any or all losing orders at the end of the day and consider them the cost of doing business. I need to let this ea run for a couple of weeks though and see what happens.

A sincere though of best wishes to each out there trading this live. After last weeks wonderful success it was a very natural tendency to try live with this one.

Hi All : ) As of this post at 8amIsh PT my "H02" demo is running Closed +370, and Float -840. The other demo versions are running ~-200/-400 on some to +400 on others with most floats running well over -1K and some -2K. This is about the best thing that i could have gone through w/this EA as it is a real eye opener to the fact that all EAs must be understood as to the optimum market mood they need to be profitable. Get any kind of trend going with this one (even the "H" version with its safe zone) and it gets walluped.  
  
I think we really need to incorporate trend/ranging indication with this EA so we know when it is safe (safer?) to trade with it.  
  
I will not mention the other EA i'm testing here, but it has weathered this just fine (+650 closed / (from +100 8am to -125 as i post in float on retracements on my "Majors" test.) As i did not have it running last week there can be no direct comparison between the two EAs. Who knows, it could have tanked last week when FB rocked!). There is no HG in EAs. But then we all knew that. It just took a week like this one we are in to pop my FB bubble. BUT I am still commited to understanding how to tame this beast! Turn it on when market is ranging with the proper settings and i think it's a winner.  
  
Thom  
  
PostScript after reading the below post. I agree that the GBP can kill FB. Though in my current H02 test, GBP accounts for 240 of the 370 closed pips, and only -150 of the -840 float pips.

Just wanted to post a few thoughts here...  
  
I have actually been live with FB 1.0a for about 2 1/2 weeks now.  
Started with a $600 mini, currently just shy of $1200 account size with a float of just over $200  
  
Trading 0.25 lots on eur/usd, usd/chf, usd/cad and aud/usd (started 0.1 lots first week and a half).  
  
The last few pages have been everyone complaining about the recent "trend". Myself, I just see a half day spike that is already starting to retrace (and has banked 4 TP trades this morning). Now, if the prices continue for the next several days without any retraces...I'm in trouble, as is anyone lse running this live. But, as I said, all we have had is a spike. Maybe slower than a news spike, but a spike none the less.  
  
I have yet to have any trade hit a S/L, so I am happy in that regard.  
I was considering trying the H02 version, but after reading how it tries to protect from trends...it won't help much. From what I found, it will stop opening new trades if it hits a S/L. However, new losing trades will continue to be opened until that first S/L is hit. Therefore, with the seemingly popular 30-300-30 settings, you will still have up to 10 losing trades...  
  
Anyways...personaly, I have no intention of stopping the EA in the current market, and will ride out this recent market move. If things work out, everything will retrace and bank me a whole lot of pips...if not, then all I can hope for is some good fluctuations to at least make some pips on the way to a S/L.  
  
Just thought I would add my $0.02 (closer to $0.05...)  
  
Chris

All my major losses today were on the gbp/usd. I had one order retrace for +35 pips so I closed it right away. The other pairs have been great. I still could not get any usd/jpy trades. Does anyone have an answer for this?

Hi Coolhand.  
  
That is exactly what I have on my live account, two pairs. It's just a little in the negative right now, (whoops, just went positive) so far not disastrous!  
  
The float on the 1b2 is over 50% of the banked pips!! So the net of 809 pips is after the float has been deducted. (Actually banked almost 1700) I would think that the float would be higher on this method due to the hedged entries.  
  
Well, my live v1.0a shows about $140 banked and $104 negative float. But at least the equity is positive now! I think we just have to hang with this on carefully selected pairs and DO NOT overleverage the account to avoid margin problems. But, it is very early yet.

Chris, this is a great post and also reflects my findings. Are you using the original 30_300_30 settings or have you gone to the more aggressive IND settings? Thanks.

Well, I'm the one who suggested it, so, I'm also using it. They set it up within 48 hours, as they said. I sent a support request on Saturday (labor day weekend) and got a response back from someone soon after.  
  
I connect in using Windows Remote Desktop. I've had no problems so far. I have 4 instances of MetaTrader running with a crap load of pairs and it hasn't made a dent in my bandwidth utilization. I'm also running with about 55% of my memory with all of these instances and other services running on the machine.  
  
One thing for those of you new to VPS servers, you need to make sure you get a Windows, not Linux server. This may seem obvious, but, I just wanted to make sure you know.

I'm using a bit of a combination.  
All pairs have a 300 pip loss, but TP varies from 20-30, and Pipstep varies from 15-25.  
  
To answer Narc:  
  
200:1 leverage (Default IBFX mini)  
"PipLoss" setting in the ea is at 1000  
MaxOpenOrders has been hovering around 20-23 on all 4 pairs

The reason for the GBP performing badly over the past week, is the speculation that the British PM (Blair) is about to resign/retire. Like someone said (sorry I cant remember who that was) its a slow spike, based on rumour at this stage, and a retrace is currently happening.   
  
Hopefully everything will go back to normal, soon.  
  
I was worried just like all of you of margin call, but Im back to a safer level now.

I agree but 1.0c is failing the test miserably -- almost a 30% loss now. The hedge version is more stable. The C version works remarkably well in tight ranging markets though.

Hello Coolhand  
  
As I know there is an error in the EA codes for trading Yen pairs. Here is the fixed version v63g for Yen pairs.  
  
Seems that live trading with FB V63G-TS is the safer option if the USD/GBP isnt included in the trading.  
  
Can anyone please make a FB V63G-TS version for Yen pairs?  
  
Hope this can help and improve the trading with Yen pairs.

do you use fb 1.0b with safe zone, how do you manage hedge-positions ?  
  
i agree with you about large loss and float, i think that to introduce hedge strategies is reasonable to stable EA.  
  
what do you think about this and my previous post

Here's my updated testing result after 4 full days:  
  
v1.0c1 37-4 -343 pips with -$1,200 float(0.1 lots)  
v63-TS 17-1 210 pips with -$1,600 float(0.1 lots)  
  
As everyone can tell, this is not a typical result for firebird but I think I can say, relatively speaking, the more effective the version of firebird you're using in a range bound market, the more vulnerable it can be during a strong trending market.  
Anyone has the testing result for H02 version though? I don't remember seeing a lot of people experimenting with it.

I've been testing the H02 fro the last couple of days and would be happy to post the results, but don't know how to generate those statement reports.  
  
Anybody care to share how to generate them?

Open the terminal window if not open. Click the 'account history' tab. In the window right mouse click over one of the closed trades that are displayed. Select 'save as detailed report' from the right click menu. Last go to the directory where you saved the report and zip the files you want to post.

Thanks kihl! I tried everything and could not get any yen trades. I was disappointed as the yen made a big move down but I didn't get one trade. I'll load this one and see how it goes. Thanks.

I had 2 live account running - FB 63G fixed on 1 minute and v1.0b3.  
  
Today (Friday) at 9am EST I had to pull the plug on both. 63G fixed lost more than 50% of value and 0b3 about 25%. I could not stomack the losses any further. I am licking wounds now and will see what I will do next.  
  
The day that we all feared arrived sooner than I thought. I only started to go live on Monday...

Been live 3 weeks now with good ole' V63G, and I'm quite happy with the results. Like Cthauber, I'm running the 30-300 settings with % = .1. Even with the current conditions, none of my stops even look close to being hit.   
  
However, as many of us have commented in the past, I think this EA needs "managing" just like any trading tool, and that a traders success (or lack thereof) will be in line with their success as a trader in general.  
  
My management has consisted strictly of turning the EA on or off at certain times based on what I see in the market and the nature or direction of my float (not necessarily the amount of float...). I still think that closing any winning position early is a bad idea, and closing a losing position early is bad 99% of the time. The pairs I've chosen are EUR/USD, USD/CAD, and sometimes USD/JPY. I thought about including USD/CHF, but IMO it behaves too similarly to EUR/USD so I left it out.  
  
Even with the EA turned on 90% of the time, float has never exceeded 15% of my account. I'm currently @ +1140 pips (+27%) with ~340 pips float. Based on what I have ascertained from the market, I hope most of the float will be "flushed" out positively soon.

I have been trading for two years now. First year unsuccessfully, now I am scratching out a fairly nice profits. I have been a manuel trader this whole time. I have been reading and watching auto trading for some time now. What I am asking for is how to install firebird to test it.  
thanks in advance to the kind soul that helps me.

I still think that closing any winning position early is a bad idea, and closing a losing position early is bad 99% of the time. The pairs I've chosen are EUR/USD, USD/CAD, and sometimes USD/JPY. I thought about including USD/CHF, but IMO it behaves too similarly to EUR/USD so I left it out.

Good to hear that you're still in profit sm31. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
You have been using it long enough and made enough pips to withstand the DD right now.  
Those who has started using firebird this month, I am afraid all of them are losing right now.

up to now i think it was my fault those losses. becos i have known that cable is very very risky and doesnt fit to firebird. and the result of this was a margin call which was caused due to my GREED.

posted above were some numbers for v63H02 version.  
  
seems to be good during normal market volatility, but gets hammarred during highly volatile markets, and can whipe you out quite quick.  
  
for now it seems to be spinning it's wheels.

Greetings fellow pipsters. Some of what this post contains might be considered out of thread context so read at your own peril. I realy like what FB does in a tight ranging market. I think we've all come to the conclusion that FB rocks during such times. Several posts and thoughts have been suggested as to figure/determin when to use FB for max gain and minimal drawdown.   
  
This week i continued my tests on FB in demo on every version [at our resource page](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/). The test continues to run as i post here. the H2 version was added this week and is now +800 closed and a whopping -3300 on a 10k account. I must state that in real life i do not think i could handle such an occurance without a good deal of emotion! All other versions are running in either barely up (say 500pips) or down from -500 to -2000 with floats averaging -2000 at this stage.  
  
Now onto the read at your own risk part.   
  
Not to simply sit around and wait for the grimm reaper, in my typical fashion i kept studying and reading and there are a handful of successful trade-with-trend EAs. One of which i opened up this week on Wed and it has banked 1300 net pips this week with no remaining float as i closed it down for the weekend (float was at -25).  
  
So here is my thought on EAs so far. . .   
  
I am determined to understand and implement a trading style that will include the mind of the machine and the soul of man. To take a phrase from an old SciFi book, "The Voice in the Machine". This can be done and somehow i would like to continue on this line, and i know it might take another thread as i do not wish to hijack this wonderful thread on our beloved FireBird that works so well in ranging markets. That said, i'm not one for beginning new threads at the factory, but this might just warrant one. I'll do some searching to see if there is such a beast, and if not might just post something.  
  
Hope you all have a great weekend!  
Thom

This is the week for a trend EA!  
  
In true form for me, I STARTED Firebird v1.0a this past Tuesday AM on 2 pairs.  
  
very small lots. Thank goodness.  
  
At 12 Noon EST I am now down a net -582 pips.  
  
I'll keep hanging in there for a while though. Really thinking that the more conservative Pipstep settings might have been the way to go in long term trading.

agreed.  
  
Not hit any SL yet but margin is precarious. USD is at an outer fib level now so hopefully we'll get a reversal on monday. these massive slides are uncommon, the market ranges 80% of the time.  
  
lesson: use smaller lots and higher pipstep!

Accrete,  
It seems a very nice result you got there. Is it from firebird or some other system.

Hi all, i guess i might have opened a can of worms w/that prior post and i apologize. I am asking the EA creator if i can share it over here at the factory as it is at another forum. I'll update you all if he says i can share it here.  
  
Have a great weekend.  
: ) Thom  
  
_Here is the update that i got from the author of the EA that i've had good success with, the quote can be found[here for more info](http://www.forex-tsd.com/suggestions-trading-systems/1964-gridmacd.html): "Yes, this EA is still for Elite members only_ _". So there you have it. If you are interested check it out, but i will not mention it again here as to keep the integrity of this thread. Please don't PM me on this, you'll have to check it out for yourself if interested as it is in a pay-per-month area of the website. I think i paid $12 a month? Anyway the private area has forward demo results dating back to February 2006 on may EAs for MT4. Well worth the small fee IMO._

Here are my results from 8/13 - 09/08. This week my equity fell $450.00 but over all the results are still good. This test includes all GBP and JPY pairs. From the start of the test Firebird v1.0a has increased equity $1,800.00 trading 1 10K mini lot at a time.  
  
My other tests with other versions are not doing as well.

Has anyone come up with what they determine are the ideal pairs for firebird? I see a lot of posts where people are trading just one or two pair. What are your opinons on the ideal 4-5 noncorrelated pair?

I have picked up 88 wins and no losses [touch wood!] in the past 4 weeks with 63G TS with one of my Real Accounts with Interbank. The Open Trades are approx. $600 at present on a Mini account that has been using between 0.4 to 1.0 contract.  
  
The profit is down to under the 30pips [like 15] on average because I have set the trailing stop to 14, but it was with Mono's setting apart from that. 6 pairs are traded, Eur/$, OZ/$, Can/$, Eur/CHF, Eur/Yen, $/CHF [NO CABLE].

You should have given the hedge version a chance to correct itself... technically speaking it shouldnt hit the 50% mark like the 63G because its opening positions in both directions.

Hello Birders,  
**  
This week firebird show us his teeths....**  
  
I run firebird to on two live acounts (63G), one without GBP, means without a drawdown, the outher with GBP, so i had a sl. Two long positions are still open and near the SL... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f621.png?v=15.1) But my problem is not realy a big one, i hedged the GBP at 1.8780 with double lotsize from the 3 open buy positions... so i´m still in profit with the GBP... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
But we should fix the "trendproblem" from firebird if he should perform well on the long run... With the actual versions (maybe not "b" versions, but i also don´t trust them) this bird garanteed wiped out our accounts if a strong major trend starts !  
  
**So this is my idea...  
  
**Firebird is a counter trend EA, this means he opens positions when a long/short run is over in the outher direction... ok, that we know...   
  
**B U T (!!!)  
  
**we also know from all our Demo and Live testing that near 95% of all postions get a 2nd, 3rd or more pipstep order... ok, that also means when we change the entry direction we alsways (remember near 95% ) get minimum one winning trade in trend direction...  
  
I know, some of you think i´m a litle stupid, there are "b" versions what make exactly what i write, **and i say they are flase...  
  
W H Y (???)  
  
**Don´t forget, the main calculation for the entrys is still counter trend, so it´s not the same at all !!   
  
We should anyway test it. Just change the entry side, when Firebird goes long, the "Trendbird" should go short and vince versa. If we have an complete EA witch works that way we can test it and use different settings for entry in trend direction, so we can change MA-length, MA-type, Percentage, Trailning Stop... and so on, only for this EA who opens in trend direction....   
  
Think about it, if you let both EA´s run on the same account and the same pairs you will gain double in sideway markets and be hedged from the beginning when major trends starting....  
  
I hope somebody have enough coding experience to code this so we can test next week !  
  
Thanks for your help,

That's an interesting concept Mr. Trader. Any other thoughts out there?

I wish i knew how to code! Since this is relevant to the above question, i'm reposting a snip from something i posted on another thread:

THEN the EAM would turn on the respective EA for that type of market. The user could designate which EA s/he felt was appropriate for the type U/D/orS, after all there will always be arguments as to which is the best in any given market, so we would not have to force say a FireBird on someone for a ranging market, and your favorite EA for trending markets. . . I know this is e<DO do conditions.< market current the for tool proper off on turn to work its EAM let then and choose let?em Just market. trending a in similar or interested] if links follow google p>asier said than done. But in the end i believe an EA Portfolio of sorts will eventualy win the day. That is the direction i am heading and researching.

...and that's my 2 pips worth.

additional thought on FB testing. So what is the most popular flavor of the week beginning this comming market open Sunday the 10th? I've done so many tests (i should have listened to Mono's advice to simply "pick one"! LOL)... well with that in mind i'm trying to do just that. But with such serious losses last week, and that included the default "c" version, that pulled in a sweat 1275 net pips the prior week, i'm lost. I have read every post in this thread, and there are pros and cons on using each version.   
  
What will you start market open with and why?   
  
Cheers,  
Thom  
  
This is will most likely be quite a large PostScript thought but i didn't want to create another new post. I've been reading and testing a particular trend following EA that i found at another forum. There was a short discussion on how it might be safer when auto trading to have the TP and SL info hidden from the broker. Well i had not thought of this, and when i first ran this EA last week (in which it grabbed +1300 pips) i saw there was no data in the TP and SL columns. When i asked over at the forum i found that they were created dynamicaly according to the rules of the EA. I'm wondering if something like this could be written/utilized in FB to make it more invisible to the broker's prying eyes? If that would help in the long run for profits for us??

Hi all!  
  
last week was a really bad week for most of us...especially for the ones who put his or her hard-earned dinero to trade firebird.  
  
I know most of us prefer a fully automated trading, I do too!, and we should keep exploring for better solutions...but for the meantime I think we can make a good use of more manual means of protecting your account if it really works.  
  
For most with a lot of floating loss right now, open long GBP/USD positions are what is bringing the float up and also that is what is potentially really hazardous to your account. A coming move down South 100 pips should get you at least 500 to 1000 pips of loss, shouldn't it?  
  
Here comes the interesting part, **what if you could tell a couple of days ago there was a probable 280 pips move South coming after moving 130 or so pips move in the same direction?** Off course, you could bail out with a lot less loss at that point, could'nt you?  
  
In fact, we could predict the move and prevent the major loss that happened this week if we knew what Moutekitrader (one of our fellow menbers at FF) is generously sharing in his thread "Mouteki Trading".   
[http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=7883](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showthread.php?t=7883)  
  
I would recommend you to read his document thoroughly (this is very important!) and start applying it from the coming week.  
We already know how powerful firebird is and we only needed a means to predict a strong trending market, didn't we? I haven't traded yet using the method but it certainly looks promising and powerful! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
**Please make sure to take your time and read the document thoroughly**...I'd hate to see many people from this thread go there and start asking rather basic or stupid questions that can be answered by reading the document and the thread...**hmmm please read the document and the thread twice** to make sure that won't happen. Well, you get the idea! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
Cheers.

To our surprise, it might increase our profit by 100%!  
I was thinking about the same thing when one of my open position was floating around 5 to 10 pips below the TP.   
  
Different broker uses different server time hence different chart data but I feel some people get totally different result from using exact same setting on the firebird. I would not be surprised if that is due to the degree of manipulation on the brokers' parts...I didn't type it but my fingers did! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
But seriously, that can add more profitability to firebird but there's one problem with not setting TP and SL at the server. When, for some reason, we can't connect to the server...lost internet connection, virus attack, broker's server disrupted, for example...our accounts would be very vulnerable to sudden market moves. We cannot say with certainty the market cannot move 1,000 pips in one day in any situation...even with reasonable S/L that would be a margin call time anyway though ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1) .  
  
  
  
Unless brokers are manupulating manually, what can work would be something like this: 

Firebird initially sets T/P at 100 pips but when the price reaches at 30 pips in the money, it closes the position immediately.  
  
  
Firebird initially sets S/L at 350 pips but when the price reaches 300 pips againt the position, it closes the position immediately.  
  
  

It all depends on how brokers, potentially, manipulate the price but what do you guys think?  
  
Closing positions randomly depending on the momentum of the move may be more sophisticated solution if brokers can outsmart us using the above tricks.  
  
Cheers.

Here's the result of my demo after 4 and a half days:  
  
v1.0c1c 38-9 -1329 pips with $1,050 floating loss(0.1 lots)  
v63-TS 18-2 -60 pips with $2,500 floating loss(0.1 lots)

Now i'm really confused. LOL. I know of a trader that was using FB65 with a timefilter set from 7am GMT to 6pm GMT, basicaly this covers the entire Europe session and the first hour of the morning NY session. With the default settings he grabbed 900pips. So what are we missing? Does the filtering of time really help that much? Anyway, i'm going to give it a go with [this version of FireBird](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives/Firebird-v065tf.mq4) and see how things go this week on 1m charts for EURUSD/GBPUSD/USDCHF (I know Mono is shaking is head right about now. grin). There was only one change i made to the default settings. For some reason the MA_timeframe was set to 0 (zero), i changed it to 15. Would this original setting have some factoring in things? Or maybe it is left at zero and the user then sets the time frame they are placing the EA on? No further details were given.

It strikes me as funny, in a sad way, that something so obvious could have been missed. Just click on the "this version of FireBird" and the version available on the net copyright by TraderSeven with the same code we use in other versions to set the trading window... it will download for you with the settings used except for my note in the original post 838... haha. Sorry, you're gonna have to read the post to read my tweak.  
  
Come on ppl. Read! And Study.  
Sorry, don't usualy behave like this, but some times it's just to much.  
  
All that said i'm not near ready to commit any real funds to any EA, but they are fun to demo and test to see if they show promise, and some will.

Thanks Accrete! I have to agree with you a little, although there really is a lot to read and assimilate here.  
  
I would like to share one experiment I have been doing since August 10. I have been running 3 pair only on the original, not too zany mono settings of 30-300-30. Tha would be TP, SL, Pipstep.  
  
I am running on the 5 minute charts rather than the M1. Original 63G.  
  
These are conservative figures I know, but the account has been rather impervious to last weeks bad results. Far fewer trades than other settings  
  
As of this morning a net of 2215 pips (on three pair). Currently only four trades floating for a loss of -119 pips. (already subtracted from net amount).  
Never had a very scary drawdown yet. Just something to think about.

_**In a single word; "Helpful".**_   
  
In more detail? I have had a great time over at the tsd site and i've found the people to be courteous and generous with their knowledge. There are some real great coders over there such as CodersGuru who was featured in an article for the upcoming MQ contest. NewDigital that runs the Elite area is very gracious and knowledgeable. I just want to put on record over here at my "Home" forum, that they are a great bunch of fellow traders.  
  
=========end of ramble.  
  
**TraderOne, thx for the info.** I've found in my testing that running on a 5m chart is helpful in filtering out some of the noise, still don't understand fully why, something is going on that is helping though. I didn't have much action last nite in the FB test, but then i realized that i need to have another running along side to have something to weight them against, so i'll open up an original tonight and run'em both.  
  
Great to hear your account is in the black. You stated you are running the "original", am i to take it that it is the 65G without TS? The 65 does have the TS function, and last week i did note that the TS did help at times.  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Nope. The "original" I refer to is Firebird 63G. The one with no divergence fix for JPY pairs and no TS. Real plain vanilla 30-300-30 settings on M5 charts.  
  
It has never closed a loss in 1 months time now. 78 wins and 4 floating, two currently in profit.

OK guys.  
  
The point I was trying to make was that I am running the EA on M5 charts with the old 30-300-30 settings.  
  
You can run the EA on the very first message in this thread. Firebird v1.0a  
  
Run it just like it is and run it on the 5 minute charts.  
  
I am running it on USDCHF, EURUSD, USDCAD.  
  
My point was that it ran thru last week's disaster and actually made some gains. I attribute that to the more conservative settings and the M5 charts.   
  
I'm thinking about adjusting my live account to the M5 charts.

EA's simply do not work! They all seem to kick ass until one gloomy day and.... BAM!!!!! MARGIN CALL!!!!  
  
I've been there, done that... Dont take offense, just trying to help. EA's are the lazy mans hope for fortune... You know what they say about a fool and his money right? So dont be fooled into thinking an EA will work. I know by our nature that we really hope one day we will formulate the winning EA and our hearts, hopes and dreams trick us into believing we will... WELL WE HAVEN'T!!!! There are tons of them out there and they all suck!   
  
Please dont take this post wrong. I'm trying to help. Dont trust a computer with your money. It has no discretion!   
  
Here's an analogy... Ever meet someone who was nice as pie? Said and did all the right things? All the while something inside you made you dislike this person and you didn't know why??? All your friends and family said you were wrong about this person... Until one Gloomy day..... BAM!!!! His true colors showed! Same as trading with an EA! BAM!!! MARGIN CALL!!!  
  
I hope this helps some who still have hope!  
  
Thanks,

yes bago.  
  
I'm attaching Elihayun's Reversev63G from the TSD thread. Could we use this on separate charts within the same MT4 and thereby provide the perfect hedge?

Caution is a good thing. EA's are simply tools in a traders box of systems and strategies. Unless a trader can see that they need management (like any other system), then no, they won't be profitable.  
  
In my opinion, if someone is a poor trader without EA's then they'll be a poor trader with them, and vice versa.

Well I have to disagree. I am currently profitable on FB from last week I think by using conservative settings and an account which provided adequate "cushion" aganinst marging calls!  
  
EAs don't work when overleveraged, which I suppose is what many people do.  
They are several that can work however with conservative settings.   
  
For instance, I recently posted of my experiences with Firebird on M5 charts with the more conservative settings. It ran thru the big "bad" time last week and is still very profitable.  
  
I think that EAs probably don't work if you try to get rich in a month. If you set conservative goals of say 10 to 20% per month, I think they very well can work.

When i read the first 3 or 4 posts in this thread one thing that caught my attention was the stop loss/take profit ratio.  
  
To gain 30 pips you guys are willing to lose 300 pips!!!  
  
Which means you need 10 winning trades to equal a single loss!!!  
  
100 winning trades to equal ten losing trades!!!  
  
This is insane!!  
  
You know what this means, it means you could winning for 9 months and lose it all in one month.  
  
The take profit stop loss ratio should be at least 1 to 1 or 2 to 1 and not 1 to 10!!!

Thanks for the conventional wisdom.  
  
Actually the 300 stop loss works well.  
  
The EA wins about 30 trades per each loss when run on conservative settings. (30-300-30) I really like it on the M5 timeframe as compared to the M1 as far as reliability goes. A large enough account to withstand unexpected drawdowns when beginning the EA, then the EA will do the work. It needs room to breathe.

traderone - what do you think of using the reverse FB and normal FB on the same account (different charts) - wouldn't it provide the perfect hedge?

ok, guys. I have to say this.  
Many will disagree, many will declare me mad and some will even want to kill me...

I think using 60min timeframe on a 5min chart with 0.15 percent will filter out most noise to avoide being on the wrong side of the market.  
No losing trades starting 2004 July with these settings.  
I know backtest don't say anything, but it gives us a clue.

I guess somehow I have missed the reverse FB!  
  
I do know that I have run the 1b2 hedge version for the last two weeks and made 800 pips on 4 pair. That includes the bad week! I'm beginning to think that the previous wisdom of having $1000 in the account for every .1 traded is perhaps too aggressive for LONG TERM use.   
  
I am now using .5 minilots per $1000 account per pair and feeling much less pressure on the margin etc. I feel it may now be much more possible to weather the occasional storm. I'll look for the reverse version.  
  
As long as I can thrash the rates that the banks give me for my money, I'll be happy. I don't need to be rich by next month! (Wouldn't turn it down though)

I won;t call you mad!  
  
My Firebird 30-300-30 on M5 charts, .1 percent on EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD for the past 5 weeks has not lost a trade and shows only 3 neg floating positions right now.  
  
You must have a decent size account to start with and then just leave it alone . Interesting thoughts HUMAX.

Ok this is going to sound redundant, so forgive me, but i want to try it on my [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") demo.  
  
That FB thing on the 5 min chart with a conservative setting.  
  
How do i program my demo FXCM account to follow the instructions.  
  
Anotherwords how do i connect the metra chart with the fxcm demo account so as to trade automatically?  
  
An earlier post showed the steps but used search program files, then your broker MT4. What is that.  
  
My fxcm file in program files has no expert file.  
  
  
Its in my Metatrader file near indicator and i have downloaded some pivot files to the indicator list before. But can i download the fire bird to my FXCM demo?  
  
Plus what do you mean decent size. Say i want to start with 5000 on a mini account trading say 3 or 4 pairs.  
  
What do you mean .1 minilot.

It compiles OK for me. I get 5 warnings no errors. I have it running on one chart since last night but no trades yet. I am using the version you posted a few posts back.

What are your settings and currency pairs?

TraderOne,  
  
It's incredible that you had no loss for the entire last week...your setting is most likely one of the safest out there. Thank you for posting...you saved a thread!  
  
  
And now to all others,  
  
it's nice to see constructive discussion going here once again. I thought the thread was closed for the season!  
  
I think the setting TraderOne has is great. That will allow us to go back on our journey for the ultimate EA, that all the boys and girls out there sincrely desire, without the risk of giving up one day with nothing in our hands. After all, he has pretty good stuff already, we can always go back to what he has right now. That's a big advantage for us! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
I have a question to be answered regarding the firebird that takes opposite possitions mentioned earlier.  
  
I have one time spent a couple of weeks trying to formulate my own EA though there was one thing I could not understand.  
In the process of trying to make a profitable EA, I have come up with one that loses almost 3000 pips in a month in a backtest!   
  
I set its TP and SL to be equal and it was losing about same number of pips.  
I then coded the EA to take opposite positions...and the result came as a surprise. It still loses a lot of pips per month!  
  
My point is that even if you take spread into account, shouldn't it have backtested to make at least 50% of 3000 pips which is 1500 pips or so if the ratio of TP and SL is 1 to 1?  
  
I may have messed up something so I cannot know for sure why I didn't get the disired result by just reversing entry/exit criteria on the EA. That kind of threw me off and that was the end of my project.  
  
Someone with experience coding/backtesting please advice. Thanks!

MT4 build 196 contains a bug. 197 is out now. My broker doesn't have it yet, but there's a link on the Metaquotes site if you're just on demos. I think it takes a day or so for broker's to get the update.

Hi there, yes the bug on the "Reverse" FB is there, it happens to be a simple duplicate comma , ....that's it. So you can double click on the error line when you try to compile it and you will see the obvious error.  
  
Now, what you can do also is take your favorite version and just reverse it yourself. Very easy to do. Here is a paste of a post i made over at tsd this morning:  
  
After fixing the small extra comma error in the above posted reverse FB i went ahead and tested it in demo today on another version of FB head to head with a normal. They both tripped trades in opposite directions on the EUR in the normal, and CAD on the reverse in harmony on seperate MT4 accounts. Interesting to watch. The FBrev closed out 3 trades at 18pips with +1 float as i post, and the normal closed 29+ with -45 pips...funny stuff this FireBird. But at least we know a simple code switcherooo does what we told it to.  
  
  
snip of code change, just copy paste the lines from the "BUY" and put them in place of the "SELL" code. I just commented out the original lines " // " so the original was still there for future referrence. Remember you will do this switch on each area your version takes a trade. Some will have several, so look for them all. Here is an example paste from one of these areas inside the FB version i used for my test this morning:  
  
  
if((myMA*(1+Percent/100))<BID (Bid && Direction!="22">=(LastPrice+(CurrentPipStep*Point)) || myTotal==0) ) // Go SHORT -> Only sell if >= 30 pips above previous position entry   
{  
OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,slip,Ask-(Stoploss*Point),Ask+(TakeProfit*Point),"",MagicNumber,0,Blue);  
// OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,slip,Bid+(Stoploss*Point),Bid-(TakeProfit*Point),"",MagicNumber,0,Red); OrderWatcher=1;  
Direction=2;  
}   
if((myMA*(1-Percent/100))>Ask && Direction!=11 && (Ask<=(LastPrice-(CurrentPipStep*Point))|| myTotal==0)) // Go LONG -> Only buy if >= 30 pips below previous position entry   
{  
OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,slip,Bid+(Stoploss*Point),Bid-(TakeProfit*Point),"",MagicNumber,0,Red);  
// OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,slip,Ask-(Stoploss*Point),Ask+(TakeProfit*Point),"",MagicNumber,0,Blue); OrderWatcher=1;  
Direction=1;  
}

thanks accrete, interesting to see how this pans out. Now where is the double comma I have to delete? or would you be kind enough to post your mended reverse mq4?

If you are running an EA that can blow up on you in one day and create a margin call then yes, I would say that EA is doomed for failure. However, I have made up many EA's for myself and used them all profitably (some more than others) but in no way is any EA I use going to cause me a margin call in one bad day of trading.....probably not even one bad month. All an EA is supposed to do is help you "baby-sit" the market while you might be away and to say they will all fail eventually is to say that every traders methods here will fail eventually and I totally don't agree with that. An EA is a tool, that when used properly has no more success/failure rate than you do as a trader. My $.02

Hi,  
  
You CANNOT run the firebird EA on anything other than MT4, METATRADER 4. FXCM does not support MT4, so you can't use FXCM.  
  
You can try to go to any broker that has the MT4 platform, for example, interbankfx, and download it from there. Then you have to enable the EA.  
  
Hope this helps.

When you install MT4 remember what directory you installed it to and you won't have to search for it.  
  
The idea of decent size would probably mean take into account that Firebird can open a lot of positions. Start with 1 mini lot per position. This may vary depending on your settings.  
  
.1 minilot means one tenth of a minilot or a microlot or 1K lot. [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") did not offer these when I used to trade with them.

The M5 timeframe has been run as a test (demo) for the past month on FXDD.  
  
My live account is currently on IBFX, unfortunately I did not use the M5 but instead the M1. It is currently down a couple of hundred bucks.  
  
I will try to post this mornings statement on the M5 account. Soon as I can get it zipped up.

Well today has been a little somber for my hedge version but it is still positive equity for over two weeks now. The divergence is true.

OK. Somebody asked for the M5 demo statement.  
  
3 pairs only on M5.  
  
30-300-30 settings on .1 percent  
  
I have pushed up lots a little as equity increased, but started with $10,000.  
  
Wish I had started my live account on M5!!

Very nice!  
  
You have inspired me to post a copy of my results without GBPUSD, GBPJPY, and EURAUD. Those were the only pairs I had loses on. On Friday 09/08 I posted a similar report with the 3 pairs included which were a drag on equity. I used one minilot per position trading with v1.0a.  
  
I have been running all my demos and live account on 5min.. I think it is best. I had to shut off my live account and clear a few items do to low margin last week so I'm only showing a small profit there. I almost had that $200.00 account doubled before I got to aggressive.

I run 24-5 and have done limited testing on times.  
  
I would like to remind everyone that there is a lot of info about trading times in the original Firebird thread. Starting with aprox. post #200 Hendrick posted about tests he had run and created an EA to help Firebird's trading hours. This was before Phoenix. There was a lot of discussion that may be useful.

You're using 42 pip targets on this? It also looks like some of your trades were closed before hitting SL. Did you have much manual intervention?

Traderone, what have you seen as the largest drawdown with this? And it looks like you started with .5 lots, then moved to .3 and then around a bit. How did you determine your lots sizes? A few of your swaps are quite high, but not too high overall. Thx

I had zero manual intervention. TP = 42 on all pairs. It is a demo on the MetaQuotes server. It seems to mainly effect JPY pairs. I have no idea why unless it is those occasional 'trade context busy' errors. My live account at IBFX does not do this.

Okay, the reason I thought there was some manual intervention is I noticed a losing trade that closed at other than the stop loss.

I'm not quite sure what trade you are talking about. I don't think I have had any closed losing trades since I eliminated the 3 pairs as noted before. I might just be blind from looking at so many different statements tonight.

This was for EURUSD USDCHF USDJPY USDCAD AUDUSD EURJPY EURGBP EURCHF GBPCHF. On my live account I've eliminated EURGBP and GBPCHF and EURJPY as well because they hurt me last week.

Hey NVWINE that is a NICE statement.  
  
Glad to see that somebody else can help support my thoughts on M5 timeframe.  
  
Yesterday was a tough one for Firebirds. My M5 demo took a little over a 100 pip loss from yesterday morning. Now all three pair have almost the same pips!  
  
I started this account a little over a month ago on the EURUSD and USDCHF. It was on $10,000 and I used .5 lots on each pair. When I decided to add the USDCAD I lowered the lots to .3. Later when my equity increased, I raised the USDCHF back to .5 and the EURUSD to .4, since margin seemed not to be a problem for this M5 demo. Today's statement. I still like.

How did you decide to use 42 for a TP? Seems to work well for you! What are your favorite pairs now? I have considered adding back the USDJPY. Thanks for sharing.

The version 63G that I am using on the M5 test does not have the divergence fix for JPY pairs which 1.0a has. But since I'm not trading JPY at this time it doesn't matter.  
  
I would expect no difference if I were running 1.0a.  
  
If I do decide to add USDJPY then I will switch to 1.0a.  
  
At this time, I would not touch 1.0c with a ten foot pole. Those settings are too aggressive I think for long term trading. Might be great for the summer doldrums though! I'm gonna tuck 1.0c in the corner for next June, July, and August.

Read post #898 for version  
  
On an account that small, which is I suppose a mini account on IBFX, I would only run two pair and no more lots than .1 each. That would be essentially tencents per pip.

I think getting the reverse EA to work in tandem with the real 63G would be a winner, at least in theory. problem is activating both on the same platform. I think it may be a magic number issue.  
  
any bright programmers out there have a solution?

The reverse EA works with v1.0a for me. At least on EURUSD.   
  
I am not a programmer so it takes me a while to evaluate the code especially this much. It looks to me like the EA controls settings on EURCHF GBPUSD EURUSD internally. It looks like it sets percent, pipstep, and trading hours. It would be nice if someone smarter than myself looked at this.

Is there any way to fully automate the Firebird on the internet? I mean that, it will not need to work on our computer but it will be uploaded on a server and we will not depend on our computer.... crashes, power cuts, freezes and other problems will not be there... Do you know any service or broker that can do this?  
  
  
And anyone may open a managed account for firebird so people like me will join?...  
  
We know it is already automated, but shouldn't it be better be on a server so we will not need to maintain our computer all the times?.  
  
Thank you.

Hi,  
  
I have studied most of the FB code quite intensley. Doing that I stumbled over a bug in the trailing stop code in all known FB EAs (063-TS, 1.0c, 1.0c1).   
  
Since its only a tiny change I try to describe it here:  
  
First, find "TrailingStop" in the code. it should app. look like this:  
  
if(TrailingStop > 0)  
{  
if((Bid-OrderOpenPrice()) > (Point*TrailingStop))  
{  
if((OrderStopLoss()) < (Bid-Point*TrailingStop))  
{  
OrderModify(OrderTicket(),OrderOpenPrice(),Bid-(Point*5),OrderTakeProfit(),0,GreenYellow);  
return(0);  
}  
}   
}   
}  
the bug is the red 5, change it to "TrailingStop" on both places and you are done.  
  
Now the setting of trailingstop does have an effect.

Hi nvwine,  
  
To me this part of the code seems to be a residual from older versions. If you want to get control over all settings directly, you simply look for   
  
SetupGlobalVariables();  
  
quite shortly after start. Insert // at the beginning of the line to gray out the whole line and you are done.

Swissly,  
  
Both methods work. The reason the 5 pips is used is because when using TrailingStop (t/s) value, the first t/s trigger modifies the new s/l to within 2-3 pips of entry price. If reverse happens now, only 2-3 pips profit. When using 5 pips and t/s=30, the new s/l is set about ~25 pips from entry price. If reverse now, ~25 pips profit.   
  
The advantage of using the t/s, you can have many more t/s modification orders that increments the s/l 2-3 pips more profit each cycle.. This can be beneficial in long trends. In short trends, which FB likes, you can lose a good part of the +float.  
  
As always, I could be wrong. In my side-by-side forward testing and backtesting the 2 methods, the 5 pips method was substantially more profitable.

Hello I have a suggestion... This thread became lots of pages to crawl through.... Wouldn't it be great to edit the first post by putting a link to a latest version and a manual answering questions like:  
  
How it is installed, how microtrades are done, what are the settings and how they are set, which pairs best to use?...  
  
It would be nice to see that in the first post and the manual in the link can change as the project is improved...  
  
This way there will be no need for asking oer answering same questions? just a suggestion....  
  
60 pages and a thousand posts for people who just started to read this thread.... not so easy...

After getting blown out of the water by the gbp last week, which should not be traded with firebird at all, I reset my account. I'm currently using fb v63g-ts. I like the trailing stop. Closes trades in profit and stops the big losses due to major trends against your positions. I'm running this version on the m5 charts, 3 pairs, eur/usd, usd/chf, usd/cad, thanks go to traderone for the pairs, with a 50-300-30 setting, ts=20, 0.1 lots. So far over the last 2 days I banked 180 pips with -47 open. Not bad in my opinion. That comes out to be a 74% success rate. Hard to do better than that. I did notice that this version has a different ma timeframs than v63g. Does anyone know why?

THX NVWine, yup had read it all, just wondering if anyone had more updated info since a week with firebird can mean the diff between version g001v903j*^$*, and version g2ien98. LOL  
  
I'm mainly just back to the 63G-TS and 63G-TS(with TS off) to test apples for apples, seeing if the TS is a benefit or not. As i've stated, there wasn't a version in my tests over the last three weeks that was net-positive, but i'm not giving up. It all comes down to knowing when to use FB and when to turn it off, and maybe even lick your wounds and close some bad FB calls(?), and use FB as one of two or three EAs in a Portfolio of sorts with EAs for various market moods.  
  
Just rambling. THX again all.

Hi Benq.  
  
I have just started using a calculation of .1 standard lots to $2000 of account balance. Or essentially 1 mini lot per $2000.  
  
On my live mini account I am trading .5 minilots per $1000 balance. This is using the M1 timeframe.  
  
I just think this will really help avoid margin calls in those "dark" periods so that in the good ranging times we still have an account to trade with!  
  
I do think however that conservative settings of 30-300-30 or thereabouts on M5 timeframe should allow trading .1 standard lots per $1000 of account. There are just fewer trades with this timeframe.  
  
Hope that is clear as mud![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I have two demo accounts. One of the demo accounts is using FB 1.0a with five currencies. The five pairs were EUR/USD, USD/CHF, USD/CAD, USD/JPY and GPB/USD on M5 charts. I thought this version was a failure due to losses. However, on closer inspection of the trades, the first three pairs were making profits and the last two were making losses.. The profits on the first three pairs were over $300 in less than a weeks trades on a 5k demo account.  
  
How much capital can I get away to trade three pairs as needed? I have a live account with FXsolutions which does not use the MT4 platform to manually trade. I can not be at the computer all day due to a job, so I need to open at another account that uses MT4. Just wish FX sol would support Mt4. I will keep FX solution to trade the other pairs in my spare time.  
  
Thanks.

If, I up my micro mini account to $600, I can trade two pairs at .2 or 20 cents per pip? or maybe .3?

Well let's see. I'm running two pair and have 10 trades open right now on my live mini.  
  
What would happen if you had 15 trades open on 3 pair and .2 minilots?  
  
A little close for comfort I think. Right now I am thinking of adding more pairs and REDUCING my lots in order to spread out the risk/profit.   
  
If I were you (and I know I'm not) I would trade 3 pairs on no more than .1 minilots on a $600 account. Then, after you get some experience with how much cushion you have after say, 3 weeks trading, then you can decide if you can increase your lots or perhaps pairs.  
  
What is the hurry for bigger lot size? Do not even come close to overleveraging your account. Automatic trading works much better that way. After all, this is REAL money we are talking about, not demo.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1)

Wackena,  
  
Thanks for your explanations, I now see that you had very good reasons for coding like it is; sorry for calling it a bug!  
Is my understanding correct, that you actually didn't implement a classical trailing stop routine but code to catch positions very close (5 pips) to target and lock them in? If this is correct then I have one remark: the variable "TrailingStop" is actually a trailing trigger and not the stop itself. The trigger is a one time shot moving the SL to actual ask-5pips. This also means to me that "TrailingStop" does not come into action if you put it at the level of "TakeProfit", you need to have it some pips below. if for example the TP is 30, TS could be set to 25. This would move the SL to TP-10, as soon as TP-5 is reached.

im rather curious about 1 thing.  
why doesnt anyone consider using Mono's individual settings to do more test and confirm it?? it seems very profitable other than the gbp/usd currency..  
Am i not seeing something that everyone else is??

If this is correct then I have one remark: the variable "TrailingStop" is actually a trailing trigger and not the stop itself. The trigger is a one time shot moving the SL to actual ask-5pips. This also means to me that "TrailingStop" does not come into action if you put it at the level of "TakeProfit", you need to have it some pips below. if for example the TP is 30, TS could be set to 25. This would move the SL to TP-10, as soon as TP-5 is reached.

Yes, I think you're spot on with your analogy. That's exactly why I set my tp=50 when ts=30.  
  
Most other Trailing Stop routines that i've seen are based on, or slight deviation, the Expert Advisor Sample on mql4.com.

I have ran mono's individual setting for a month and it did survive the "disaster week".  
But the demo account has expired after 1 month so I can't continue.  
Details about the demo is:  
Traded 7 pairs starting account 50k usd went above 100k before the DD.  
DD made it go to 30k and went above 60k again just before it expired.  
As we all know, most DD comes from gbpusd.  
Sorry that I don't have more info.

Humax - actually very valuable info.  
  
The disaster would have been lessened with a combination of higher SL, lower PS, and avoiding cable. Just weathering the storm/trend by not over-leveraging would have seen FB through it as the USD is now retracing nicely.

Traderone,  
If I understand your posts correctly, you're trading 3 pairs, and you would trade 1 mini lot per 2,000. Are you saying then for a 10,000 account, you would enter with .5 lots in each of those pairs. A total of 1.5 lots if each had just one position on? If all three went to a pipstep, you'd have a total of 3 full lots on. Is that right, or am I missing what you're saying?

Firebird is an EA or Expert Advisor not an indicator. You need to store it in the Experts directory. One directory up from the indicators directory.

Hey coolhell, firebird is an expert advisor, you need to put them in the experts folder, not indicator.  
  
I wanted to update my trial with v63G-TS. So far for 3 days, +311, -80, for a 74% success rate. I don't know if anyone can beat that success rate trading manually. FB has closed 11 trades, 3 with trailing stop. A little bit better than last week for sure. The experiment continues!

coolhand,  
  
I added the trailing stop to FB to maximize profits out of trends. For example: t/s=30 is near equivalent to t/p=25. If EA only has t/p, it exits orders at this profit level. But with using t/s, the EA treats t/s as first takeprofit level and if trend continues, additional pips can be made. Using t/s with FB takes nothing away from EA performance, it just increases chance to make additional pips.  
  
Note: As discussed earlier with swissly, If using FBv63g-TS, set t/p above t/s. I suggest setting t/p above expected trends. I use t/p=50. I think setting at 100-150 is a good idea and could allow major pip gains from long reverse trends.   
  
2nd note: For recently started FB EA and how FB handles news events or long trend spikes is determine a lot by when EA was started. Over last 6 weeks, several times I have started same EA on separate Demos, with identical settings, on different days. The results on news event days and strong trends were almost 180 degrees different. For example, one will have sell loses and the other demo will make profits from buys. The longer the Demos run, this effect equalizes out and both perform nearly the same. So judging this EA badly because of short term loses, is not a true evaluation. For me, I critique this EA like I critique my 401K. It is the long haul gains that I want. The last few years, my 401K has seen equity loses of 15-20% during each year. But overall it has gains from year to year. If I can get similar results with FB, I will be happy. Sorry, I'm long winded today.

hey wackena, I love the trailing stop in firebird! I tried the other versions but settled on this one. I use a tp-50 with a ts-20. I'm not convinced yet that I should raise it. Now raising the tp is something I did not consider. I'll have to think about that. My goal for every trade is 20 pips, if more great. Today fb nailed the chf move which caught me by total surprise. 50 pips in the bank! I wanted to run fb for this month and see what happens. Like every ea, I don't think you can just turn it on and leave it. It still needs some maintenence each day. Even if it means closing some orders for a loss. I consider it just the cost of doing business. I have closed 1 trade so far for 0 pips because I did not like the direction of the trade, and because of the news release that was scheduled. I'll even turn it off for some news releases, just to be safe, and stay out of the market as I would trading manually. I totally agree about the long range view. If I can continue with this level of performance, I'll be very, very happy! Good job on this one my friend!

BenQ, if you don't mind me butting in here, we were talking about v63G-TS. I really like the trailing stop feature in this version. There is another one with a trailing stop option i think, but this one seems to work better for me.

I have tried out the original FB 63G. With Mono's basic settings.  
USD/CAD, USD/CHF, EUR/USD, GBP/USD. I used .02 lots per 100 in the account. I increased the lots on the best pairs, then on all others, until they were the same then increased agin like that as $ allowed.  
  
I have posted my results below. I have also included my settings and a template. I really got the EA to the settings I liked after the 19th trade. I also made one trade on the account by accident. I do not know if my results are typical. I took a $500 USD Demo up to $1650 in a month. I only had one real FB loss. The others were from my tweaking or tests early on.   
  
I did not really have a bad week in the last month. I hope this helps. I am using IBFX and this account expires in a day or two, so I am posting now while I can get a good report.

Wakena, thank you for your post 930, glad you were long winded today : ) great info you shared.  
  
Today i'm happy to say i re-read the entire original FB thread today, all 1136? posts, and this one to 934. Great info we've got here. And though the last couple weeks have been challenging for FB in certain ways, re-reading these threads has only strengthened my resolve to hang in here with you all and see this EA from demo to pips in a live account.  
  
=========  
  
On a seperate comment/Q; I have been also studying over at the fx-tsd site and there is info stating that the "ClosingHour" setting of say 23, will run the clock up to the last minute of that hour, i.e. 23:59 . And "24" is not used. Whereas "OpenHour" means just that, i.e. 00:00. These are the settings one would use if one wanted the ea to run around the clock for 24 hours uninterrupted. I looked in the manual for MT4 and did a search for "ClosingHour" but came up with no hits. Does any one here have a verification of this?   
  
Thanks,  
Thom

Hi there, one thing that i remember through today's reading is there are some that have fine tuned their trading pairs down to basicaly the EurUsd/UsdChf/UsdCad if only going with a few pairs on a smaller account. I am currently demo trading these and don't see any issues to speak of.   
  
During my reading tonight i came across a thread that mentioned [this article "Identifying Trending and Range-Bound Currencies"](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/05/062205.asp), and was wondering if there was data that would support trading such pairs as the crosses. One small snip from the article had this to say which i thought was interesting and maybe applicable for FB? ;

> **Crosses Are Best for Range**  
>  In contrast to the majors and commodity block currencies, both of which offer traders the strongest and longest trending opportunities, [currency crosses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crosscurrency.asp) present the best range-bound trades. In forex, crosses are defined as currency pairs that do not have the USD as part of the pairing. The EUR/CHF is one such cross, and it has been known to be perhaps the best range-bound pair to trade.

It is hard to fathom, for instance, that Switzerland would go into a depression while the rest of Europe merrily expands.

Comments? Observations in your forward testing of FB? My mind is mush after reading both threads today from beginning to end again, though i do remember someone stating one of these less traded pairs was a sleeper for fb??

>  If I understand your posts correctly, you're trading 3 pairs, and you would trade 1 mini lot per 2,000. Are you saying then for a 10,000 account, you would enter with .5 lots in each of those pairs. A total of 1.5 lots if each had just one position on? If all three went to a pipstep, you'd have a total of 3 full lots on. Is that right, or am I missing what you're saying?

Nope. On M1 charts, my thoughts are to trade only .1 standard lot per $2000 in account balance. Therefore, to trade 3 pair, I should have an account of $6000 minimum.  
  
I think with the more conservative M5 charts one could be OK with trading the .1 lot per $1000 account balance.

I found most of the crosses like EURGBP and EURCHF etc. to not be profitable at all . Probably have not found the right settings.  
  
So far I think the best five pairs are USDCHF, EURUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD, and USDJPY, traded on M5 charts on 30-300-30 settings on version 1.0a.

Another update? Sorry, but I can't help myself. Here are my results for the week using fb v63-ts.  
  
Total pips closed - 439  
Total open - 125 - all are negative, one open sell order at -96 from 9/12, opened just before the chf went wild high  
  
Success rate - 71.5% orders closed at the moment, but 3 of the 4 open trades could close early next week  
  
Balance increase - +13.74% total - +9.25% if I closed all open orders.  
  
Let's see what next week will bring, we have some big news events coming up. I tried this week to turn this beast off during news releases and turn it back on after the dust settles, such as today. FB closed 4 orders today for 99 pips after the news with only 1 order open. Not bad at all.

Here is my update for the last 5 weeks with a real account.  
125 trades, 124 wins with my first loss [Swissy]. Trading with 63G on Mono's setting except for the TS set on 20 now. My pairs are still the same [see earlier post]. Graph enc. showing the account from $5 K to over $6k in that time. BTW; If my S/L was 315 [instead of 300] I would have been OK in this trade. 5 mins after beeing stopped out, the market turned back down.... But that's trading!!

Well done,   
  
The swissy is the safest and most profitable pair with firebird, my live account is growing by about 10% per week trading just that pair.

PS; I have 2 live accounts using Firebird [spreading it around!!] and I find 63G T/S the best at the moment and my O/T are very small [at present].  
  
But this week on a DEMO I used the 'fixed' version of 63H03. From Wednesday until Friday inc, the results are pretty good including trading with Cable and its derivaties.  
  
About $4K nett with one contract [not mini] with 32 wins and no loss...

blewmoon, I noticed you are using the v63-ts version, so am I. I really like the trailing stop. Care to share your settings?

A little different than I have. Thanks. I have been using a 5 min chart this week. Seems to filter some noise. I noticed you lowered the tp from 50 to 28. Any reason for that?

coolhand,  
  
Now I can't think why I reduced it. Was it because Mono suggested a 30p target and I had seen the market 'struggling' around that level in obsevations? Who knows why a trader does these things [with out clear testing]....

Wow Mono.  
  
Wonder what I've done wrong. The last two weeks I've lost 12% of my live account mostly on the USDCHF! And you've gained 10%. Hmmmm. Even more to puzzle over.

My tests this week on FB were break even for the most part on 63g/63g-TS, up a couple hundred pips net for the week with all trades closed out on friday. The bigest looser for me was the H test with -600 pips. I was on 5m charts on the EurUsd/UsdCad/UsdChf.  
  
Crazy stuff. And you'll be happy to know that on my 63g 30-300-30 backtest w/Alpari 1m data from Fall of 2004 to present we'd only be down 3k in your original 10k account...haha. At least we could still trade another day ; )  
  
What to do, what to do.

Graph enc. showing the account from $5 K to over $6k in that time. BTW; If my S/L was 315 [instead of 300] I would have been OK in this trade. 5 mins after beeing stopped out, the market turned back down.... But that's trading!!

this is unfair, i were testing v1.0a v1.0c, had several loss the week after NFP.  
  
so, 63g-ts version is the best after all ?  
  
~Just a suggestion,  
  
could we make firebird increase it's lot size every 4 open trades?  
  
the most latter opened position would be the most possibles winning trades, right?  
  
anyone can make such version of firebird?   
  
  
Life goes on

Hello, I am using the demo, the firebird and will be live trading it in a month.  
  
I setup the demo account at $250, as I will go live with that amount too...  
  
Now, the question is: Is there a way to limit the number of open trades, or there is no need to do that?... As I saw in a previous demo, it always generates signals. Is there a need and way to limit the open signals, or let it open as many trades as it can?..  
  
What is the most beneficial and efficient limit?...  
  
I mean a money management (%) only for version 1.0a, not c or 0.63....  
  
Thank you,  
  
E Gw

Going over my statements of the last couple weeks using the 5m charts it appears there were no major bloopers/hiccups during any of the big moves. I am wondering (since i had no 1m tests open), if ppl in general are seeing a benefit (TraderOne thanks for your input and testing on the 5m charts!) to the slightly larger time frames? Wakena? Mono? anyone else have a feeling for them yet other than what has been contributed already?

Well, after losing 600 pips the last two weeks on my LIVE account on M1 charts, I am moving my live account to M5 charts today on the 1.0a version.  
Two pair, EURUSD and USDCHF. I will add USDJPY and USDCAD with smaller lots on M5 same version.  
  
I plan to begin testing of H03 on the 5 minute and m1 charts. I will continue my testing of the 1.0b2(hedge) on M1, and may begin M5 testing on the trailing stop version also. Good luck everybody, especially you LIVE folks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hello firebirders,  
  
Now i tested Version H02 (30 min timeframe / 5 min charts) also during the trending days last week. This one works great !!  
  
Now, can somebody code the trailing stop routine from V63G-TS into this Version ?? So we can maximise profits with more secure...  
  
If somebody can pls code it into verion H03 some posts above !  
  
thanks,

chad, I would say usd/cad or, and this is just my experience, the nzd/usd. You can some decent moves out of either one. Stay away from gbp or it's crosses, too volatile for this ea, leads to many open orders.

Wow, I'm completly baffled at the lack of trades taken when ur live verus demo. I've been live about a week now useing 1c tradeing the same pairs, same settings and the live account does not take a third of the trades as the demo. Does someone have a anwser for this odd behavior. I'm making quite a few live pips, but would of been lots more if firebird was taking the treades like in the demo?????????????????????????

Both demos take many, mamy more trades. Too weird. The broker should not be able to influance the MT4 can they????

I have been trading fb v1.0c and v1.0a (s/l 250 and t/p 30) on FXDD and Fibo Group. I started FXDD out at $500 and fibo at $300. They both were cut in about half due to losses on M1 charts. Once I switched over to the M5 charts, I have recouped my losses and then some. Now both accounts are above what I originally started with.  
  
It appears the larger your account becomes, the more trades are opened. However, my concern is when you hit a negative value for "Free Margin".  
  
For folks live trading on a live/real account using this EA: Have you ever had a margin call because Free margin hit 0 or less than 0? Or does it not work that way?

The ping failed is a connection error. Usually means nothing, unless that is all you see. Old tick, see [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=460](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=91487&postcount=460)

cgldsmith,  
  
I backtested v1.0b3 on usdchf and it did place hedge orders. Hedge order should be placed at same time as first Pipstep order.  
  
Do a backtest to see if you see hedge orders.

I am trading LIVE on IBFX right now on four pairs. The last two weeks were rocky but I'm now above my starting point. I have not had a margin call at all. I am also now running on M5 charts although I started on M1 originally.

Hello fellow fbers,  
  
I have the FB running on NF and activated however it has not taken a trade since inception..  
  
Expert Advisor is on and script has been attached to chart.. What could be causing this EA not to work?  
  
I am using North Finance as broker if that helps..  
  
Thanks,

Make sure there is a smile not a frown in the upper right hand corner of the screen.  
  
Check the 'experts' tab and the 'journal' tab in the terminal window. Any errors?  
  
Make sure the time frame on the screen is not too large. 4hr and daily trades a lot less.  
  
How long have you had the EA activated? Which version of FB? Is it one with money management?

Hi wackena,  
  
Thanks so much for the help.. I will check it out.. Two more issues which I have encountered  
  
1/ I get a donk sound ( windows sound) everytime the euro moves up and or down hehe.. The sound is very similar to the sound when a trade is entered or exited. Euro is the only pair which makes this sound.  
  
2/ A friend of mine is having problems with the EA as well Ver Firebird-v63G-TS.mq4 He has the file in the right folder I believe.. We are communicating via YM.. When he clicks on the EA in the left margin he gets the sub menu where he can click on " Attach to Chart" He says nothing happens when he does this..  
  
I have asked him to enable expert advisors at top.. Verfied that he has the script in the right folder " Expert Advisors"   
  
Cannot think of anything else for him to check.. Can you ?  
  
Thanks again,  
  
Sanchez

My brother had same problem. The dreaded "dong" sound. He was using a satelite dish to receive data and dial-up to send data. This generated a lot of dongs. I'm not sure, but I think the dong sound is result of a Ping failure. The ping is used by broker's server and your MT4 platform to determine good connection. If not, the server or your MT4 generates the dong sound. The FB EA does not have sound code in it. If the excessive loss is triggered, you can get an Alert box with the alert sound.  
  
It can be annoying, but the dongs do not interfer with trading.

Traderone -   
  
Thank you for your feedback. I am planning on going live with $250. May I ask what you started with? Also, are you running with v1.0c? I see in the code there is MinMarginLevel which is set to 250. However, I have also experienced changing those values under the "User Input" section of the code do not have any effect in v1.0c.  
  
My concern is having too many open positions starting out with a small account ($250) putting me at risk for my positions to be closed out if free margin hits 0. This could very well happen if say 3 or 4 positions are open and there is some kind of news release.  
  
Wackena (or anyone) - What does MinMarginLevel do and is it related to "Free margin"? Am I being overly cautious with my concern?

Hello firebirders,  
  
I ´m live with both of the versions (V63G-TS and V63-H03) and can say they are work realy very good. There is only one problem, a little bit safer and more exact trades the Version V63 H03 but i don´t want to miss the feature of trailing stop anymore...  
  
The trailingstop save the gain but there is also a chance to maximize the profit if price runs into your direction...  
  
_**So is there somebody who can code exact this tralingstop routine from V63G - TS into the version H03...**_  
  
Both verisions are attached !  
  
I would realy appreciate it !!  
  
Thanks for your help,

Thanks for your input..  
  
No errors.. What I found out was two things.. The first problem was I had the EA in scripts and not " Expert Advisors" Secondly I had to change the lot size because with NF as my broker you cannot trade micro lots.. Min is 1.00 pip  
  
Thanks for the reminder.. I totally forgot the smiley face in top right corner

To all programmers in this forum...  
  
just have a simple question. I would like to add money management features, TS features, and orders open features to one of the versions (63H03) that doesn't have them. My question is, can I copy and paste these features by taking them from the Firebird versions which contain them and then recompile the Firebird version I want to place them in? Is there a specific order in the program that they have to appear, etc. Any help is much appreciated.

This might be a nice EA if possible to tweak in such a way. Right now my 63H03 is running on the EurUsd/EurChf/UsdCad/UsdChf with the same individual settings that Mono is running on 63G. Just began the testing a few weeks back so nothing much to report.

I am running on v1.0a. started with a mini of $2200. Running the four pair at .5 mini lots. (Around 50 cents per lot EurUSD). My settings are conservative, not like v1.0c.

Hello Mr. Trader,  
  
here it is. As I'm new in programming, make sure that you are doing same tests before using this version of Firebird on your live account.

I thought that I should post some results of a test that I'm running at the moment. It is on M1 and on 12 ccy pairs running over the last week or so on demo account.

I'm not sure if everybody has the same or similar opinion, but I'd say that running FB on M1 charts is a brokers dream come true ... so many trades and so many times that they take the spread from you, and remeber that the spread comes both ways, on the entry and exit.  
  
On the other hand on the M5 charts it is significanlty more subdued and calm. Much less trades, but still appears to be profitable. Actually it may be even more profitable then on M1, but havn't done this comparison yet to hard evidence of it.  
  
Anyway, it looks likes this may be a candidate for putting down some real money behind this system ... maybe?  
  
The comparison posted above have default settings, nothing tweaked on my end for all ccy pairs.

your statement might look better if you drop cable and the jpy.  
  
just looking at FBb3 and 63G - why are the fast and slow period values different?

I've been reading through all threads about Firebird and I feel that I'm going nuts. I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish this one.   
Please someone tell me, what version of Firebird is the best so far? Is there is one which will not open countless trades?   
Thank you

None of them will open countless trades really.  
  
But I am live on v1.0a.  
  
Settings are USDCHF 25-300-25  
EURUSD 22-300-25  
USDJPY 22-300-25  
USDCAD 22-300-25  
  
So far so good. Percent is .1  
Divergence =true  
  
I am running on M5 charts. I think that could be very important.

Traderone:  
  
Are you getting pretty negative returns this week in USD/CAD on the 5 minute. Others are great but down on 0.10 lots over $128 currently on open float, very small amout booked profits on USD/CAD

I don't know if anyone else has run into this.. I imagine you have since there are quite a few folks using IBFX with firebird v1.0c. Here's my issue.  
  
I just installed MT4 from IBFX last night and loaded v1.0c EA using a mini account. What happened was it started opening trades at the micro amount (.10 cents a pip vs $1 a pip)  
  
I deleted that account and created a new account using a standard account type with 1:200 leverage. When the EA ran, it created .1 lot sizes and p/l was $1 per pip, but the margin was $100 per lot size. So I lost my 1:200 leverage.  
  
I then tried going back to a mini account using 1.0 as the lot size which created a margin used of $50 per lot size and $1 per pip. But the EA is coded to use .10 so the ea didn't work. I tried changing the lot size in the ea to 1.0 but it still didn't work.  
  
How do I make this work correctly?

Thank you, Traderone. I'll try this one. But I remember that many people run it on M1 charts. Does it make any difference?  
Another question, what is suggested minimum deposit? Is 3000 is ok? Do I have to change settings according to my deposit size?

The weeks of Sept 5-15<SUP>th</SUP> have been heartburn weeks for me. Out of my three accounts running Firebird, of course, my live account was the one that took the losses, first two stop losses in GBP, and then I had to manually stop out due to approaching margin call. The first demo account running FB63H2-3, which was started a week earlier and with more funds ($5,000) then my live account (~$3000) had sufficient equity but had floats approaching 50% of equity but survived without any losses and to go on to profit. The 2<SUP>nd</SUP> demo account running FB 1.0b2 was funded with $10,000 and it also approached floats approaching 50% of equity. Unfortunately, my timing was lousy in my live account (running mostly FB63H02-H3, but switched briefly to FB 1.0b2 during the steep trending of the Euro. I had doubled the lot size on the four major pairs I was trading the week before the downtrend in the Euro. This put too much risk into this account resulting in my closing trades when margin calls began to threaten. One thing this did do was to underscore the importance of money management! Instead of sulking too much and becoming depressed I decided to take a look and ask questions and see what I could do to improve the outcome of the EA. I first looked at how the EA works as described in the script noted below:<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
_Firebird calculates a 10 day SMA and then shifts it up and down 2% to for a channel. For the calculation of this SMA either close (more trades) or H+L (safer trades) is used.__When the price breaks a band a postion in the opposite of the current trend is taken.__If the position goes against us we simply open an extra position to average. <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>_  
  
**_50% of the trades last a day. 45% 2-6 days 5% longer or just fail. <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>_**

1) Why a 10 day SMA? Why not 15 or 20, etc? What is the advantage of a 10 day SMA?<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
2) Why not automatically close out trades held > 5 days; this would guarantee that most (90-95%) would close in profit, keeping down the float. Those closed out for a loss would be “the cost of doing business” and protect margin.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
3) In a trending market the V1.0b2, would seem to be more profitable because if the pair trends heavily, the trending side will go to profit while the hedged side will continue to move further away from profit. In a trending market, (how do we determine trending?...maybe by the number of candles in one direction?) the counter-trade should be hedged by less (rather than by an equal amount of the initiated trade.) The hedged part of the trade which should be determined by placing a pending order, should be triggered after the candle closes and determined by the direction or trend of the previous x number of candles. By reducing the amount of the hedge, say by 50%, we have a greater chance of it hitting the profit target. We know that in trending markets the retracements are less than in ranging markets. By limiting the number of days in the market and the amount of the hedge we increase the probability that our target will be hit. The way you could set the hedge percentage amount would be to wait until the initiating candle(s) was formed and then set the hedge amount by a percentage, determined by the strength of the trend…25%, 33%, 50%, 75%, etc., or as has been mentioned in a couple of posts, by fib levels, ie. 23%, 38%, 50%, 68%, 85%... <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
4) If the float is controlled by #3, margin calls are not so much of a problem. <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
5) How does MA Time Frame affect the EA?<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
6) It is absolutely imperative to control the number of open orders. By closing out orders that have not matured in 5 days and/or have gone in the wrong direction by 50% or X% of the stop loss, this allows more profitable trades to be opened up. Trader Seven talks about this in one or two of his posts.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
7) It is imperative to have money management set up. Human nature is to be greedy, impulsive, etc. A mechanical system based on a set percentage of risk…and I mean total risk…not necessarly risk on each trade is absolutely necessary to survive. If margin approaches a certain percentage, then the EA needs to start closing out the least profitable trades to protect equity! (based on #6.) <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
8) A note about Firebird v. 1.0b2.; the hedging version. When a position goes against you it initiates the pipstep function. Does it enter both a short and a long? Wouldn’t it be preferable to only enter one position, not both positions? If it does enter both positions, this only maximizes possible losses in the wrong direction. It does, however, provide for a profitable trade if the trend continues. Does the pipstep continue to run indefinitely if the position goes against you as more entries are made? If it does, maybe there should be a limit to the number of pipsteps.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

Yeah. USDCAD has been disappointing this week. But the USDJPY has been good.

>  I added the trailing stop to FB to maximize profits out of trends. For example: t/s=30 is near equivalent to t/p=25. If EA only has t/p, it exits orders at this profit level. But with using t/s, the EA treats t/s as first takeprofit level and if trend continues, additional pips can be made. Using t/s with FB takes nothing away from EA performance, it just increases chance to make additional pips.

>  Note: As discussed earlier with swissly, If using FBv63g-TS, set t/p above t/s. I suggest setting t/p above expected trends. I use t/p=50. I think setting at 100-150 is a good idea and could allow major pip gains from long reverse trends.   
>    
>  2nd note: For recently started FB EA and how FB handles news events or long trend spikes is determine a lot by when EA was started. Over last 6 weeks, several times I have started same EA on separate Demos, with identical settings, on different days. The results on news event days and strong trends were almost 180 degrees different. For example, one will have sell loses and the other demo will make profits from buys. The longer the Demos run, this effect equalizes out and both perform nearly the same. So judging this EA badly because of short term loses, is not a true evaluation. For me, I critique this EA like I critique my 401K. It is the long haul gains that I want. The last few years, my 401K has seen equity loses of 15-20% during each year. But overall it has gains from year to year. If I can get similar results with FB, I will be happy. Sorry, I'm long winded today.

Wackena,  
  
When you use the trailing stop do you set both the TP and the TS parameters, or just the TS? Say for instance that you want to set a TS for 30, insuring that you gain a minimum of 30 pips. Do you set the TP @ 0 or do you also set it @ 30, or above or below it? This has always confused me! Also, if I want to add a TS function to a Firebird EA that doesn't have one, can you copy and pastes this from another version and does it have to occur in a certain part of the program? Any help you can give is appreciated for us non-programmers. (I did go out and get a book on C++ today, so my education is starting!!)

1trader2,  
  
The first thing is NOT to trade Cable with any FB....  
  
Just my thoughts having seen some of the losses caused by that pair.

I have been trading firebird v1.0c using the M5 tf trading EURUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, and USDCHF and have had very good results. broker is FXDD. The first week I used the M1 charts and took some losses.  
  
I'll attach my statement. The one thing to pay close attention to is starting on 9/13 my account balance was about 221. Down from the original 500. Since 9/13, there were only 2 losses. Basically, I gone from about 221 to 954 since the 13th.

>  The weeks of Sept 5-15<sup>th</sup> have been heartburn weeks for me. Out of my three accounts running Firebird, of course, my live account was the one that took the losses, first two stop losses in GBP, and then I had to manually stop out due to approaching margin call. The first demo account running FB63H2-3, which was started a week earlier and with more funds ($5,000) then my live account (~$3000) had sufficient equity but had floats approaching 50% of equity but survived without any losses and to go on to profit. The 2<sup>nd</sup> demo account running FB 1.0b2 was funded with $10,000 and it also approached floats approaching 50% of equity. Unfortunately, my timing was lousy in my live account (running mostly FB63H02-H3, but switched briefly to FB 1.0b2 during the steep trending of the Euro. I had doubled the lot size on the four major pairs I was trading the week before the downtrend in the Euro. This put too much risk into this account resulting in my closing trades when margin calls began to threaten. One thing this did do was to underscore the importance of money management! Instead of sulking too much and becoming depressed I decided to take a look and ask questions and see what I could do to improve the outcome of the EA. I first looked at how the EA works as described in the script noted below:<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

>  3) In a trending market the V1.0b2, would seem to be more profitable because if the pair trends heavily, the trending side will go to profit while the hedged side will continue to move further away from profit. In a trending market, (how do we determine trending?...maybe by the number of candles in one direction?) the counter-trade should be hedged by less (rather than by an equal amount of the initiated trade.) The hedged part of the trade which should be determined by placing a pending order, should be triggered after the candle closes and determined by the direction or trend of the previous x number of candles. By reducing the amount of the hedge, say by 50%, we have a greater chance of it hitting the profit target. We know that in trending markets the retracements are less than in ranging markets. By limiting the number of days in the market and the amount of the hedge we increase the probability that our target will be hit. The way you could set the hedge percentage amount would be to wait until the initiating candle(s) was formed and then set the hedge amount by a percentage, determined by the strength of the trend…25%, 33%, 50%, 75%, etc., or as has been mentioned in a couple of posts, by fib levels, ie. 23%, 38%, 50%, 68%, 85%... <o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

By closing out orders that have not matured in 5 days and/or have gone in the wrong direction by 50% or X% of the stop loss, this allows more profitable trades to be opened up.

Human nature is to be greedy, impulsive, etc. A mechanical system based on a set percentage of risk…and I mean total risk…not necessarly risk on each trade is absolutely necessary to survive. If margin approaches a certain percentage, then the EA needs to start closing out the least profitable trades to protect equity!

>  8) A note about Firebird v. 1.0b2.; the hedging version. When a position goes against you it initiates the pipstep function. Does it enter both a short and a long? Wouldn’t it be preferable to only enter one position, not both positions? If it does enter both positions, this only maximizes possible losses in the wrong direction. It does, however, provide for a profitable trade if the trend continues. Does the pipstep continue to run indefinitely if the position goes against you as more entries are made? If it does, maybe there should be a limit to the number of pipsteps.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

tradeforone, I am to running version 1.0a on a 5k demo account with three pairs with great results.  
  
It's time to open a live account with Interbank which offers micro accounts.  
  
Going to start with $300 which would require a micro account to run three pairs. What variable settings do I need to change?  
  
Thanks.

I used the default settings ... didn't modify a single value.  
  
I ran it on all of the pairs listed with my broker for the M1 charts.  
  
For the M5 I took more of the majors (8 pairs as can be seen in the statement).  
  
I would caution anybody against trading on these numbers on live. Please remeber that these were DEMO accounts, and there is anight and day difference in terms of how brokers treat demo accounts.  
  
Personally I'd have to see a result of at least 100% return on a DEMO account over one month before plunging with REAL money, and then I'd be REALLY happy to see a 10% return in a given month. But that's my humble opinion only.

Great post!   
  
This particular statement stood out to me because I think it is *very* important. My live account has been profitable all the way through this difficult time, and float has never exceeded about 25%. I think the key has been to control the number of open orders. Personally, I'm using the old V63G and I have no interest in an automated form of control in this area. I keep tabs on the number of simultaneous open orders, as well as market conditions, and maintain a number that (if they ALL stopped out) would still not result in a margin call. I believe this is key to the survivability of my trading account... a primary component of successful trading is to "live to fight another day".  
  
This is also my personal opinion, but I think the best way to control the number of open orders is by stopping the EA and allowing existing orders to "flush out" over time. I've stated this many times, and continue to assert that manually closing trades is a bad idea 99% of the time. All the testing I have done indicates that arbitrarily closing all open trades once per week (like closing all orders on Friday), or even once per month, has a quite an adverse affect on profits. Obviously, controlling open orders might not get me the crazy profits we've been seeing in the 80% per month range, but 40% this month is quite acceptable. ;-)  
  
I do have a few "deadbeat" trades hanging around from 2 weeks ago, but they are in the -180 pip range. Still a far cry from the -300 stoploss. In keeping with the way this system works, and my results from testing, I plan to leave those trades out there until they close themselves... even if swap eats up the profits.

Please - I would like to hear from anyone running firebird v1.0c (or the other 2) live with a mini InterBank account. I know folks are running it. I have yet to find a way to do this. Please PM me if you don't want to use forum space. My yahoo id is dscott5912.  
  
I would really like to get a speedy resolution to this!

hi wackena,  
  
my journal says nuthing,  
  
"Expert Advisor_v1.0c EURUSD, M1: loaded successfully" that's it  
  
ehmm i've contacted my broker and they said it got nuthing to do with the platform on demo and live ..only the difference by the streaming by 1 pips difference if it do have a slight difference  
  
so i was thinking is it because of the settings on the EA itself?

Does UseMM=true or false?  
  
If false, try lot size of 0.01. This is just a test lot size. I wonder if the 1:500 would limit max lot size.

Hi wackena, I'm jus trying to understand about what you said below.  
The EA treats the trailing stop as a first takeprofit, does this mean that if trading mulitple lots it takes profit for first lot at 30 pips?  
I'm just needing help understanding this, as I thought if you set a trailing stop for 30, then after 30 pips movement in your favour, it will start trailing, and say you got 30 pips in profit, normally firebird would close if that was your t/p, but if you have a 30 pip trailing stop, if got in 30 pips profit, and then market turned against us, wouldn't it not take profit where as if it was a straight 30 pip t/p it would have. Sorry about this, just trying to understand it.  
  
If this is unclear i'll try again.  
thanks

You are correct. I should have said it locks in a profit by trailing stop, rather than actually closing the order and taking a profit at that point.

MM can calcuate odd lot sizes like 0.12, 0.23 & etc. Some brokers do not allow odd lot sizes. They need either 0.1 or 0.2 or mini accounts 0.01 type. My NF demo does not allow odd lot sizes. No problem so far with IBFX or FXDD. if your broker does not allow odd lot sizes, then UseMM=false is needed and manually set lot size.

Why turn off the EA just to flush out the bad trades? You can keep making good trades in the meantime and help out your account equity. There is not a reason to "control" open orders unless the account is underfunded for the lots size used in trading. Try to avoid overleveraging the account.

i will keep on posting further result on demo and live performance running and NF platform.  
  
it seems like the ibfx works well on all ver..havent test the a and b version on NF platform yet..will try it later...

I have an observation / question.   
  
Some brokers such as IBFX have mini accounts where 1.0 = 10k lot and .1 = 1k lot and .01 = $100 lot. Some brokers will not allow you to trade a $100. lot. Some brokers have you enter .01 = 10k lot because they base all entries off full lots. I think this combined with money management may cause some people problems.  
  
The money management code is  

Inserted Code
    
    
       if(UseMM==true) 
      {
       Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/1000;
     if( Lots>0.1)
     {
     NormalizeDouble(Lots,1); 
     }
     else NormalizeDouble(Lots,2);
      }

For trading micro 1k lots on a IBFX mini account with $250 in it would this formula end up being:  
250 * 5 percent /100/1000 which would equal .0125 this would become a $125 lot I think?  
If it was .01 would this become .0? If it became .01 some mini accounts would not accept it.  
  
I could be wrong. Someone explain to me where my logic has gone South. I know on one of my baby test accounts I take a zero out of the formula.  
  
Wackena where am I wrong?

The purpose of turning off the EA is to control the number of open orders.  
  
I never mentioned anything about "bad trades" in my post. In my opinion there are no bad trades until they stop out. They either stop out or limit out. Although the ones that hang around for awhile can get irritating. What I don't recommend is closing them before they do one or the other. Case in point, I'm sure some people besides me had some rather "old" EUR/USD trades hanging around. Was very tempting to take a 100+ pip hit and dump them 2 days ago, but today was a different story. ;-)   
  
Controlling the # of open orders is what risk management is all about to me. For my account, the number of open trades is equal to about 60% total account risk. In other words, if all my open trades stopped out (statistically *very* unlikely, but still pretty aggressive for me), then 40% of my account remains. Controlling open orders provides me an absolute guarantee that a certain portion of my account is safe at any given time. Reducing lot size is another method for managing risk, but taken alone it isn't concrete. No matter what the lot size, potential still exists for enough float to result in a margin call unless there is a cap on the number of open orders.   
  
Obviously, there is a balance between the number of open orders allowed and the lot size for a given account. We have to allow enough "space" for Firebird to work appropriately, but with guaranteed protection for a portion of our account at the same time. For me, this is where lot size comes into play. As I have it sized now, I can have approximately 12 open orders simultaneously across 3 pairs. This number goes well with my settings, which result in about 3 trades per day. So far it has worked well even though that is a substantially smaller amount than the floating trades I've seen on some of the statements in this thread.

**Max positions open**   
  
<HR style="COLOR: #d1d1e1" SIZE=1><!-- / icon and title --><!-- message -->Greetings, I have tested several versions of Firebird. I woluld like to know if any of the versions have a defult setting for **Max positions open**?  
  
Furthermore, is there a way to set a limit for the **Max positions open**?  
  
If not would be good to have a **Max positions open tab as a way to limit potential Draw Down.**

Is this affecting my EA? Because I have a few on my charts but nothing is going on. I been waiting almost 3 days.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
How can i fix this problem. I cant make the EA deal.

ncwine, sorry for late response. For some reason that I don't understand right now, the Normalizedouble function is not working as it should. If calculated lot size is over 0.1 the normalizedouble should limit lot size to one decimal place. If less than 0.1, then limit to 2 decimal places.   
  
Also, if Risk=5 and AccountEquity is less than 100, then lot size would be 0.00. At this point, UseMM should be false and set lot size manually.  
  
Can I assume the name ncwine has a North Carolina wine connoisseur definition. I live in NC and enjoy the wines also.

After changing my lot size from .10 to 1.0 in the user input window to attach v1.0c in each chart, I noticed, after several hours, there were 7 positions opened with an acct balance of only 535. Leverage is 1:200.  
  
It caused my free margin to drop down to -8.00 (see attached file)  
  
If this were a live account, I assume all my positions would be closed as a result of a margin call?  
  
I have not seen this same effect with FXDD where it was not necessary to change the lot size from .1 to 1.0. I am curious if this is related to what nvwine and wakena are discussing.

     if(UseMM==true) 
     {
     [color=black]Lots=[/color]AccountEquity()* Risk/100/1000;

Yes, default settings for v1.0a are 30-300-30 unless you have loaded the .set files. Are you using v1.0a or v1.0c? If v1.0a, did you load any of the .set files? Also, what time frame M1 or M5?

Hi, I'd say that the M5 results "appear" to be more predictable and certainly work to your advantage. They generate about 10% of the trades that the M1 charts do, which means 10% of the commissions or [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") that are paid to the broker. This can only mean a good thing.  
  
As far as which is more profitable, then I'd have to say that it is too early to tell. Unfortunatelly I had to cancel my M5 test because my broker demo account ran out of time. So I'd have to restart both again from scratch to get a fair comparrison.

The original settings for FB 63H02 were a TP of 18 and a SL of 42. These settings were not optimal if you go back and read the original thread. Mono's settings of 30-300-30 are what worked best for this version or you can set each TP & SL as set in the 1.0c Individual version for optimal results.

For my testing on the 63H03 i used the individual settings that Mono listed for each pair i trade. So far so good. In fact the only two losses during the week that were closed by the EA were when it was set at the defaults. This was before i realized that my original intent was to have the IND settings...just got it going without'em at first.

in my opinion ,only 300 is not suit for 1.0c,you can test it use a 1000 demo account . good luck

If you're going live, I would use three currency pairs max, on mini-micro trade sizes ($5 margin per lot traded) with $300. So I would load up EUR/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/CAD and set your lot size to ".1" on a mini account like yours. I wouldn't worry about adding another currency pair until you had $500 in account equity. Then at $1,000 I would think about turning up the lots setting to .3 and then to .5 at $2,000. I wouldn't think about going up to full mini-lots until you had at least $3,000 since you're on 200:1 leverage, and that's $50 per full mini lot traded. As well all know, Firebird 1.0C has a habit of running about four trades per pair (in my experience), more or less; so money management is of the utmost importance.  
  
Is big success doable? Most definitely. The trick is the patience and the small steps. You can try and hit the ground running, but I'm not paying your medical bills. That's my bartender's money thank you much...

At me question. How you think, whether will conflict Firebird 0.63G with other advisers? Other adviser watches only it positions.

My **SMART** _firebird v1.0c_ keeps opening positions all the time in the same pair **AUD/USD** , and these positions are **ALWAYS** a loosing positions . NEVER WINS .. it keeps opening **2** , **3** & **4** loosing positions one after one , it dosent even wait for a positions to colse .. No .. it opens 4 together .. !!  
last week it opened 4 positions ( one every 2 minutes ) , **ALL LOOSING** .  
  
And now while i'm writting i have **3** **pos.** open , and of course **ALL** **LOOSING** .   
The problem is that i have other indicators that shows bullish in the pair , while _FB_ keeps openeing SELL orders .  
  
I want to ask .. doesn't this version work with **AUD/USD**???  
OR do i have to edit something in the settings ??  
And what is the best version to use ??  
  
By the way .. i've tried _FB v63G-TS_ for 2 days and no single trade have been taken till now .. So is there any settings to be used ??  
  
I hope someone answer me plz .. and finally i would like to say **THANX TO GOD** coz all these things are in _DEMO ACCOUNT_ .  
  
Thanx a lot friends .

I'm live with V1.0a on M5 charts on four pairs for the last three weeks. I am just about break even (maybe a lttle more than that). Funny thing is that all my demos are making thousands. Hmmmm.  
  
I'm thinking of changing to F X D D from IB FX for live and using only the original 30-300-30 settings on EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, and USDJPY.

I have run various demo accounts with the same settings on both F X DD and  
I BF x,starting them at the exact same time and in each instance the F xd D  
ones came out ahead.   
  
I understand that data and servers may vary but will go with most of my bucks placed in the platform that performs best on demo and then carefully monitor the live accounts.

Thanks Gleneagles for this corroboration of what I suspected. My most successful demos have been on FX D D and of course my live is on I B F X and just a smidgen profitable.  
  
Now the chore of setting up a new account. But it might just be worth it!

Nope. Just minis. You can do mini lots on a standard though.

nvwine / wakena -  
  
I just spoke with both IBFX and FXDD. Here are their policies on getting a margin call.  
  
IBFX's Policy: If Margin level drops below 50%, IBFX will begin randomly closing open positions until Margin level goes above 50%.  
  
FXDD's Policy: If Margin level drops below 80%, all open positions will be closed.  
  
Now, with regards to fb v1.0c... is there a minmargin level that the ea will not trade below? If not, can that be included in the code?

One more thing to add on this... Margin level is caculated as   
  
AccountEquity() / AccountMargin()  
  
I would presume some kind of "if" statement would be in order to make this happen, I just don't know exactly where in the code to put it

Something to keep in mind...  
  
In my back testing a years worth of EUR/USD data with V63G on the 1 minute charts with limit set @ 30 and SL @ 300, maximum float was -1425 pips. So, if you're planning to "set it and forget it" then I would have in mind the potential for 1000+ pips of float per pair.

dscott5912,  
  
I got your PM.  
  
In v1.0c, you need to monitor Margin Level % manually to avoid margin calls from [broker](http://www.forexfactory.com/index.php?page=forex_brokers).   
  
In v1.0c1, the EA auto-monitors Margin Level %. will stop opeing new trades if margin level % falls below the Input MinMarginLevel setting. This does not eliminate the danger. If MinMarginLevel is set too close to Broker's margin call level (ie; FDXX 80%), then existing orders that increase in negative float, can still initiate the margin call. This is why, my MinMarginLevel setting is 250.  
  
v1.0c1 should work OK on standard and mini accounts to control margin level %.  
  
Wackena

While waiting for some capital funds to arrive in the next few days, I was set to open a micro account with IBF. Was planning to start initially with $300 with a micro set up.   
  
Have had great sucess with a 5k demo on IBF using FB 1.0a with the EURUSD, USDCHF and USD/CAD which resulted in at least a $1000 play profit for three weeks of trades.  
  
If IBF not good for low capital trading and that FXDD is more dependable, what have you atribute this to, just the servers?  
  
Thanks.

I cannot give you an answer or an explanation simply because I have no idea what the real reason is.  
  
There could be quite a few logical reasons but unfortunately I am not an expert and can only comment on what I have experienced with both platforms on demo trading.  
  
I have not traded the FB in a live account with either of them.....  
  
Not much help.....maybe some of the IT Einsteins can provide some insight.

That's cool...but I have reverted back to manual trading as when there is a strong trending.

I'm still using fb v63g-ts with good success. So far since 8/29 with a $5k demo at ibfx using 4 pairs I'm up a total of $1047.31 with about $85 in open orders. All trades are mini lots. This ea needs to be managed somewhat, you just can't let it run in my opinion. I'm also running another test on this ea on 3 pairs on an alpari $10k account. Banked 81 pips yesterday and all orders closed. I think the trailing stop is the way to go here.

Coolhand,  
  
what are your Takeprofit and trailing stop settings for the TS version?  
  
Seems like we would have to set the TP for higher than usual. Thanks for any advice.

Traderone, my settings for the ibfx test, 4 pairs, eur/usd, usd/chf, usd/cad, nzd/usd, m5 chart, tp=50, sl=300, ts=20 pipstep=40. I have money management set to true. On the alpari test, see the attachment, I'm using 3 pairs, eur/usd, usd/chf, usd/cad, on m5 chart not the m1 as suggested in the attachment, and money management set to true also. I should also mention that my ts is set tight here, 17 for the euro, 20 for the chf, and 16 for cad. I based these values on the tp -5.

I am going live with IBFX in a week or so with a small mini account. What pair, or pairs would be a good starting point. I am looking to start with 1 or 2,trading micro lots, and move up as funds increase. Should I use pairs that have no correlation, or does it not really matter. It seems that everyone is mostly working with EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, but what if the US$ started trending, wouldn't the 3 pairs I mentioned also trend?? Putting you and Firebird on the sideline?? Or worse, left with a blown up account?

Hi Rusty,  
  
A trending market will kill any firebird. The beauty of those three pairs is that even though they do trend, they don't hang around at the extremes as much as others, like the GBPUSD, do. They tend to return to the median, which is where your firebird will pick up pips.  
  
Right now I'm running two demo accounts. One is running 63G TS, the other 63G.  
  
63G TS is trading USDCHF, USDCAD, and EURUSD on a 5M timeframe. It has net profit of $1200, including a $700 floating loss. No losers, running for about two weeks.  
  
63G is trading USDCHF, USDCAD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, and USDJPY, on a 1M timeframe. It has net profit of about $1200, including a $800 floating loss. 4 losers, all GBPUSD, again running for about 2 weeks.  
  
Back to your question, I'd run firebird 63G TS on a 5M chart, with USDCAD, USDCHF, and EURUSD.  
  
Remember, always think safety first. You want to stay in the game, and the while the GBPUSD can give you a lot of pips, it also has a very healthy appetite for firebirds! Chews them up and spits them out.  
  
Just my 2.

forexpips,  
  
I am demo-ing 63GH03_TS on 1min Time frame, trading EURUSD, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF. It's not a serious demo, I have been messing with settings as it goes. But aside from loss due to incorrect SL, and too many open trades for my account size when things went a little wacky this past Tuesday (Margin Calls :surprised ) it has been a nice up hill climb ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1) . I think next week I am going to go for a more 'hands off' approach, as far as settings go. And see how the results go.  
  
As far as 1min vs 5min, many people talk about using the 5min. Other then using a different chart what other changes to the setttings would I have to do??

Yeah thats' the real trick. When to intervene, and when to let your firebird soar on its own. The real key I think, to having this EA work.  
  
As far as changes, using 1M vs 5M, all I changed was the chart. All other settings I left the same.

Horace, you nailed it! You cannot just start this ea and expect it to make you money without some management, such as turning it off during news announcements, or what I do is turn it off when I'm not trading, such as overnight. I never know what might happen during the UK open or what news will be released. Some have said to never close open orders, it results in lost profits. My experience is closing orders in the black now is better than hoping the ea will close them later in profit. That's one reason I like the trailing stop more than the fixed tp. I'm still researching accrete's idea of creating an ea that will determine market conditions and start the appropriate ea to meet those conditions. I don't think it can be done now, but maybe in the future?

I agree with you even though it is an ea you have to monitor it. I also close trades when they are of decent profit because I have seen it go from profit to a loss rather quickly so I beleive if it is properly managed this is a winning ea its worked for me rather well on certain pairs. just my 2 cents.....Valerie.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I traded live on IBFX micro 0.1 with 200$ only from 25.08 till 22.09 using 10 usual pairs (no GBP/USD). I used FB 1.0b2 on 5M chart, 1.0 percent.After one bad week from 4-9.09 I removed all USD pairs and GBP/CHF. I found that these pairs: EUR/CHF,EUR/GBP,CHF/YEN,AUD/CAD,EUR/CAD gave me the net 1820 pips with -310 floating actually around 80% of profit.These pairs as cross-currencies do not trend as the USD pairs,so most of time stay in range.As Firebirds is the best in range market I think this could be a good way for constant profit and safe trading without stress.  
I will be away from trading till 10th October and then I will add another 700$ and trade again only these pairs.Besides I will demo the same pairs using FB 1.0b3 and will post my results.

Goran,  
  
  
Despite the success with trading the cross pairs, isn't your bottomline ultimately affected by the USD (assuming your base currency is in USD)? So for example, if EUR/CHF ranges with a nice profit, isn't there the potential of that profit being erroded if the USD is falling?   
  
R,

Goran.... what settings are you using with FB 1.0b2 for your cross currencies. For example, TP, SL, and Pipstep? Thanks for any comment.

Hi Traderone,sorry if I am late with the response but I just got up now as I am on CET time. I used 30/300/30 but I will change to TP25 for EUR/CHF and EUR/GBP.I think as well about changing max order from 3 up to 5 for EUR/GBP.

I have a quick question about Firebird.  
  
If I think I have too many open orders for my account size, and my margin is dropping, how do I safely make adjustments to Firebird so it doesn't open anymore orders, but still 'manages' the open orders?

1820 net pips are generated without USD pairs.That's why I want to trade cross's only to avoid problems with long trends.

Thanks for your updates Goran. These are pairs I had not seriously considered, and a version of Firebird I had not seriously considered. Thanks for bringing them both to mind.  
  
My live account on IBFX and version 1.0a continues to be in profit now. Running on M5 charts. Frankly ALL of my demos of Firebird on EVERY version are profitable, one now for almost 2 months.  
  
Goran, would it be possible for you to detail the open negative trades by pair? That could also be quite illuminating.

Real vs. Demo ??  
  
traderone, and all others who have gone live with FB.  
  
Ok, the big question. For the people that have gone live with Firebird, any variation. Using the same settings, same broker, how different are your results from your demo runs??? I am impressed with the demos I am running, and with a watchful eye I feel Firebird will work well for me, but not yet having run it Live I am not sure how well, or not well at all. I am not looking to get rich quick, just a nice steady pace, and with good money management and that watchful eye I should be ok, Unless someone thinks otherwise, please share your experiences with FB Live. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

On the 22th September I switched off FB (I cannot trade for the next 2 weeks),but I left negativ trades opened.I get IBFX statement every day so I can see what happens.At the moment the float dropped from 310 to 250 pips:EUR/CHF -130 and -40 as well as EUR/GBP -80.

Question for the people who are running this on live accounts. Will you leave it on tomorrow during CPI and next week during big news events like NFP? Or will you turn it off, and if so, at what point?

I leave my live account on at all times. That is why I call it automatic trading. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I haven't seen Firebird necessarily hurt by news announcements. Often there is a retracement which seems to add some pips.  
  
I just figure the more I try to outwit the EA, the more I tend to skew the results (good or bad), and the less valid my experience with it becomes.  
  
I just let it rip live with smallish lots at first, until I get an idea how it really works. All my demos are run through all news events also, so I already had some idea of what to expect.

I've had good success with FB during news announcements. That's when spikes and retracements are likely to happen. For me, whether FB is on or off is detertimined entirely by current exposure and not related to news events.

SM31,  
Are you saying here that you turn your FB off if your open orders equity reaches a certain value? If so, what calculation are you using? And are you closing any trades manaully, or do you simply turn FB off and let the open orders sort themselves out?

Guys and Gals,  
  
Please be advised I've been testing v63H04[1] at the level of 1.0 lot (demo, SBFX) for a very brief time (6:35 pm est, Sept 27, 2006). Results have been most impressive. Thus far it's posted 8 straight wins and 144 pips. I revised the settings to reflect the increased risk-to-capital associated with trading full lots, TP is only 18. Weekend's upon us (darn!) so let me test a few more days and I will post the details.  
  
I will say that at 9:00 am est today, I had a negative float of $868 and change; as I write this post at 11:55 am est, today, that negative float is only $329 and change. Translation: trade FB through**most** news announcements (maybe not NFP?) as the counter-trending principle seems to bring trades back to equilibrium and beyond.  
  
If anyone else is testing or trading full lots "live", please feel free to post or PM me but I'm sure others would enjoy hearing of your success.

Thats pretty impressive MM. This ea along with a few others are very promising but I still beleive they need to be babysitted somewhat. So far I have had really good results out of the firebird and the new phoenix on the jpy pairs but I baby sit them to some degree. Of course I'm only on mini lots so I don't guess thats of any help but one thing you may want to think about is that I only go long or short on different pairs; which ever way that you collect positive interest from the daily swap because you can hold a position for awhile but while you wait for it to go your way you get an extra kicker with the positve interest. Just some food for thought. By the way I really enjoy reading your posts on some of the other threads. Have a good one....Valerie.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Left my LIVE IBFX Firebird v1.0a running all day today as usual. Did fine and even added a few pips to the fold.  
  
I don't have the kahunas (or the bank account) to run the lots that MoneyMaster is (he is the man), but my account is in good profit now after three weeks. Running on M5 on 4 pair.

For me it's just a calculation of risk based on the stop loss assigned to each trade.   
  
I never allow total risk from all open orders to exceed 60% of my account. Knowing that FB is a "counter trend" system, I know I have to allow it the opportunity to pile up a fair number of trades. With that in mind, I have to tailor my lot sizes accordingly. Right now I have my lots sized to allow for about 10 open orders, and I'm currently using 2 pairs (EUR/USD & USD/CAD). I don't interfere with # of orders per pair or anything, just total open orders... and I **don't** **cut profits** by closing trades early. ;-) As of this moment, my balance is up 82% and equity has never exceeded 20% since going live on 8/17, so I'm not in a hurry to make any changes.  
  
To me it seems the prime difficulty with FB is protecting profits. We've seen a lot of gold fever on this and the other thread and people have allowed FB to trade their accounts into oblivion without even encountering a stop loss. All in pursuit of 100% (month on month) rates of return. Personally, I think even the 50% I got last month is stupid high and it scares me a little. So probably even 60% total account risk is unwise, but I'm greedy too... ;-)

sm31,  
  
How are you controlling the total number of open orders? I just turned a $600 demo into $4 overnight when all my open orders got margin called, they just all fell like a house of cards. Thank God it was only a demo!!!! I knew I had way too many open orders and i turned FB off this morning around 10:00 GMT by 17:00 GMT the demo had only $4 left in it. All of this was my fault, I just wanted to see how far it would go. but seriously.... you said you don't limit # of orders per pair, just total order, how are you doing that??  
  
Thanks

Unfortunately, for me it's just manual. However, it must be my settings but I haven't had trouble with FB opening a large number of trades quickly. Usually not more than 2 or 3 per session, and only then if there is some volatility. I leave it on all night, and have never had any trouble. Although, if I were one trade away from my "max", then I would probably leave it off until I could keep an eye on it. I don't trust this or any other EA enough to leave them truly unattended. The way I see it, FB just makes things easier to manage by doing some of the "busy work".

You have to have the indicator loaded to see where the bands are.  
  
You can find it at Accrete's site. Look for his posts in this thread and he gives the link. A very nice site for all things firebird. And, you need to read trader seven's pdf on how this works.  
  
I must admit I have not loaded the indicator now for some time. Just let Firebird work slowly on small lots per balance and it seems to sort things out fine over time.

Don't run 1.0c. The pipstep settings are two aggrssive for the recent market.  
  
For starters run 1.0a and change take profit to 25 and pip step to 25 and SL to 300 and run it on the M5 charts.  
  
I think it will help a lot.

Maybe it is just my setup w/IBFX, but one thing that seems to be some what of a pattern in my FB demo testing is that 63Gs and 63Hs are making significant profits the first two days of the week (Sunday afternoon through pre NY market open on Wed) and giving the profits back Wed/Thur/Fri. Each of my [FBs](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") were well in to profits come Tuesday close, hundreds of pips each, then the gave all back and then some by Friday close. I've seen this situation the last three weeks where my most profitable days are Mon/Tue. If i had shut the EAs down they would have all positive trades and nothing in float.  
  
What to do. Well next Monday i'm going to run a parallel test w/a Mon/Tue run only and see what happens.

I've seen this situation the last three weeks where my most profitable days are Mon/Tue. If i had shut the EAs down they would have all positive trades and nothing in float.

you know i've noticed that too with 63G. when i first started testing 63g on a mini i was getting good results the first ~2days of the week, so i would actually just shut it down after that. but now i started letting it run the full time and it does great like you say the first ~2days then by fridays close i've got more negative float than booked pips..we'll see how they play out at market open next week.

thank you,  
  
i'll put 1.0a to running.  
  
my live account is currently down to $430, what is the maximum lot size to trade with ? how about 0.5 for 4 pairs ?

Criss,  
  
Can you tell me which post has the background info for Fb63h02 and how it is different? I seem to be overlooking it. Additionally, are you using MONO's 30/300/30 settings?   
  
I am currently using the original Fb63G with optimized T/P settings and getting very good results.

you know alan, i couldnt tell where exactly is the info. ive tried all versions of Firebird and this seems to work the best. what made the difference was not having GBPUSD in the mix. and yes i do use 30-300-30 settings

What Traderone mentioned some posts back:  
  
I'm live with V1.0a on M5 charts on four pairs for the last three weeks. I am just about break even (maybe a lttle more than that). Funny thing is that all my demos are making thousands. Hmmmm.  
  
I realize based on later posts he is now ahead, this should prove to us all that running Firebird may be iffy at best on a LIVE account. When I open my live account shortly I think after all these Demo's I have run, I will put the Bird to rest trying Cyberiatrader, Phoenix, and some others, although might be tempted to run 4 pairs early like from Sunday to Tuesday on a Live account and see if it matches a demo account, to see if this is the case. Velocity4x claim demo and live the same although when I put my account number in the platform colors look a little different, hopefull I will find out for my own soon.

Criss,  
  
I'll have to take a look at Fb63h02 and test it out. I've been using Fb63G original on a small live account. I've been running it 24hrs through reports for the past 2 weeks. I started with .10 minilots ($1000) and have gradually moved up to .50 as of Thursday night. The live account is up about 14% but based on using margin at about 5:1. I'm sure the gains would be significantly higher with use of more margin but then I have no need to take the extra risk. I too was originally running the 30-300-30 settings which were great but I noticed my payout ratio and profit curve increase when I; 1) adjusted the T/P setting which was a little more conducive with the movement of the pairs (EURUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD) that I was using, and 2) Increased the lot size from .20-.30 to .50. The increase in gain with increase in lot size may sound like a no brainer but I did so realizing that the pips per trade would be less than 30. A trade off I guess. But more trades fire off to compensate.  
  
An additional reason for wanting to optimize was that I took a 300 pip loss (fortunately on $30 on a .1 pip position early on) on one GBP trade which upon analyzing the loss, would not have occurred had I optimized the T/P setting for GBP.   
  
Just my two cents and certainly not scientific in my analysis!

I'm running live with 1.0a on EURUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, and USDCAD. Currently on M5 charts.

OK.... Your account is too SMALL to trade lots that big.  
  
Secondly, I noticed closed trades for losses that were only around 46 pips.  
Are you closing your trades manually for losses? That is a quick route to failure I think. You must let the EA have room to work. That is why the SL is large! Let the trades alone and cut down your lot sizes right away. Or, you can try trading only the EURUSD or ONLY the USDCHF on 0.1 lots. That's all.  
  
My live account drew down for two weeks on 0.05 lots on a $2200 account before it started to recover. There will be periods of drawdown or flatness (is that a word?). I should also mention that I let it run THROUGH news events. Usually good things happen then.

Hey Valerie,  
  
Thanks for the comments. And your experience with minis is helpful; I just hadn't noticed too many posts (if any) discussing full lots. Clearly, if it works for minis it should work for micros and standards. Agreed?  
  
I've not gone live yet as: (1) FB needs further testing for my comfort level; and (2) I've yet to do the math on standards, e.g., what is my potential profit and exposure for let's say 1 standard lots, trading 4 pairs with no more than 4 open orders per pair, tp=20, and a max stop loss of 150 per pair. Sounds like roughly an account of $10 - $15k would absorb the worse case scenario (all four pairs had four open orders and all orders hit the SL; please correct me if necessary).  
  
I digress. Thanks Valerie.

Hi All  
  
I am new to the programming side of the Firebird EA. Can any one assist me?  
  
I would like to ask a few questions:  
  
1\. How does one get a functional advisor for a live account?  
2\. How does one go about creating ones own, once one becomes more experienced?  
3\. Can i do the changes directly in the FXDD site under the coding section and how?  
  
I have been doing website building as a hobby, but this is scary knowing it will effect your capital and might make you bankrupt if you write the wrong code, unlike making a mistake with the web page and just fixing it again...

Maybe it's just my setup but neither FB (63h or TS) has initiated a trade this week. What about you?

MonyMa$ter, I have the same problem.  
In my statement you'll find 2 trades I made myself using my brain.  
But I love TS very much, this is my toy. On live i'm gonna play only SL and TS.

My FB H04 has taken four trades since Sunday evening. One closed in profit the other three are in negative float right now. Trading on M5 charts.  
  
My live account of V1.0a continues in profit. (Whew).

My FB TS opened a trade on GBP/USD about 2 hours before today's news. It was in profit and almost hit my TP of 30 pips before it started heading the wrong way. I manually closed it out after losing 50 pips. (ON DEMO).  
  
But that has been my only trade using FB TS since initializing it last night on 4 pairs.   
  
I am still trying to figure out the setup inputs to tweak the EA.  
  
Keep us posted on your trades.

I was wondering about this today.  
  
My demo account is set up for USD/CAD, EUR/USD, USD/CHF, and EUR/CHF and it opend 6 trades today. 1 closed already (hit it's target profit) and the other 5 are open. The demo has been running for the last 2 weeks using version 1.0a  
  
My live account trades USD/CAD, EUR/USD, and USD/CHF and did not initiate any trades at all. I started running this yesterday, about an hour after markets opened.  
  
Not sure what to think about this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Greetings fellow FB'ers. I'm running my usual gamit of FB Demos this week. So far 63H04 has closed 10 trades, w/two big loosers on the UsdChf and EurUsd, with balance now sitting just above break even, with float of -43 pips on the four pairs i'm trading.  
  
63G-TS2 has opened 7 trades and closed one of them in profit when SL was hit for +13 pips on UsdCad. The other 6 in float are at -150ish pips. Not a good start of the week for my bird ,-(  
  
Though one of my other EAs did score. A Buy on GbpUsd at 1.8720 and closed in profit at 1.8866 at 1.6 standard (demo) lots... To bad it can't be like that all the time!

Why did you close the trade?  
  
Just because it is going the wrong way now does not mean it will be next week. Or tomorrow. We will never know how well an EA performs unless we let it perform.  
  
Just a thought.

I'm puzzled. Your FB H04 had two trades of -300 pips today? Or were they old trades from a week or two ago? Hmmmm.

I had 5 trades open today on the USD/CAD. 3 long and 2 short. 3 trades hit their limit. As of this writing, one trade is slightly positive and the other is at about -35 pips. The EUR/USD did not initiate any trades but 2 closed at their limit, but I have 2 or 3 long trades out there right now, with some close by, so the pip step function didn't kick in. In total, my account closed 5 trades today. Since 8/16 my account has averaged approximately 2.5 closed trades per day...

Thanks for the responses everyone; I'll review my code but nothing opened Sunday or Monday.  
  
I had one trade open from Friday which was operating at a loss. Left it open over the weekend "just to see what would happen". Turned into a profit Monday. But not another darn trade opened. I'm trading [demo] all the $ pairs on TS and all else on 63H, but not a single trade opened. Must be something in the code, a tweak generating an inconsistent internal logic.  
  
But the last time I thought I was wrong, I was mistaken....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Have been demo trading sucessfully on IBFX using 5k play money with FB 1.0a on three currency pairs, which are EUR/USD, USD/CHF & USD/CAD.  
  
What setting changes do I need to do if my capital balance is....  
  
$300  
  
or   
  
$500  
  
And can I trade the above three currency pairs with a low amount at the same time?

New trades, initiated on 10-02. Buy of UsdChf in at 1.2499 S/L hit at 1.2457 for a loss, and a sell on EurUsd at 1.2689 and S/L hit at 1.2731. I am just running the defaults, but next week i'll switch over to the 30-300-30 to see if that makes a difference? Most of you running the 333 setup?

I'm afraid I wouldn't touch any Firebird at a 42 SL. I've changed my H04 to 300 for sure and am running on M5. I just haven't had any luck at all with less than 200 stop losses. You know, firebird trades against the so called trend, and I think for that reason needs a little room sometimes to work.

Quick question. For some reason, my live account is now giving me the Excessive Loss alert pop up. I remember that there was a line you had to cancel out, but when I did a search of the forum, I can't find how to fix this. Does anyone remember off the top of their heads, before I go slogging through a few thousand posts?  
  
Also, why would I be getting this alert only on one pair, and only my live account. My demo is with the same company (FXDD) and both are running at the same time.  
  
Just wondering your thoughts before I call FXDD and ask them some questions.

Hi folks,  
  
Here's my latest live statement, representing 2 months trading. Firebird still performing well. i have changed my lot size occassionally to reflect my account balance. i like to keep the risk at 3% per trade or 1:1 leverage - ie. for a $1000 balance my lot size is $1000 or 0.10 mini lots. i am currently running at 0.15 mini lots or $1,500 lots.  
  
Settings: on 1min 30-300-30  
  
trading with 63G began on the 8th of August. Apart from a few manual closes i let it run on its own 24/7. All my manual closes would have been profits if I had kept them open.  
  
Wiz.

Just open it in wordpad and edit out the account number from the text and title. Just use replace to replace the number with something else.  
  
Otherwise you can use a HTML editor.

hopefully this works. I manually closed the EURUSD trades when they got close as I'd wanted to cut down to swissy only. have also manipulated PS and percent to try to get a good hedge level either side of price.

Did you have a money management issue around 9/7/06, trades were going from .10 lots to .30 lots, and those were the big losers? Just wondering. other then that it looks pretty good. What version of FB are you using??

at the moment no MM apart from trying to keep margin level above 400% and a nice controlled float. I topped up the deposit halfway to allow more room for maneouvre. I'm using v1.0b2 and the aim is to have roughly equal TP levels either side of price. Will be interessting to see what happens this friday's NFP with about 10 trades each long and short.  
  
I'm sure the hedging version must be better to withstand trends but will still need a decent reserve for very big trends without reversals.

Quite right.   
  
After correcting the coding issue I experienced Monday, six pairs opened today (Tuesday). Four of those currency pairs were initiated by v63H[04]. As I write this post, the float is $1,193.43. Trading 1.0 lots (still demo). I also experienced a similar float on Friday, but each pair returned to profit, except the one I manually closed Friday afternoon.

8 week update with my real account. I am now on 192 winning trades with one loss [a few weeks ago]. The account balance has grown to $7,280 from $5,000 with the Open Trades about $430. This is one a variety of 63's, mainly 63G and for the past 2 weeks, 63H03. Upon using the latter, I now use 15Min MA on the 5 Min Chart. The Take Profit as been set to 25pips and NO other interferance is given. The pairs are; Eur/$, $/Can, $/Oz, Eur/CH. This is on Interbank, who seem to very good.  
  
That is more than I can say about FXDD. I have a few accounts open [being a trader for 8 years], but I thought another one for FB wouldn't do any harm.... mmmh..  
  
I filled in the forms and indicated that I would open a MINI account with $4,500. FXDD say that you HAVE to have a minimum of $5,000 to open a Regular Account.  
  
I started trading it on Monday last week, it made two trades [with 63H] both of them wins. Then nothing, no trades at all on Tuesday and Wednesday until I sent FXDD at email on Wednesday [the Interbank accounts and FXDD Demo were getting trades in this time]. All of a sudden, it started trading by having 4 trades in seconds at 8.30 [news time]. BUT, when I checked they were on a BIG Account, not a mini. I suddenly realised that I was -$770 in the red [negative/losing] and this was one an account that only had $4,500 in it.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
So I turned off the Auto 63H and manually traded the 4 trades. I worked out [on a 30m chart] where the Fibonacci retracement were and ‘sat it out’ To cut an even longer story short, I made money, closed them all in profit and walked away with nearly $480 for the nights work.<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>  
  
But it has left a ‘nasty taste’ in my mouth about FXDD. If I hadn’t seen the trades and it had opened the full 6 pairs, I could have been wiped out in no time. If I had a normal Stop Loss [instead of 300 pips] I would have been stopped out in minutes.   
  
BTW, FXDD didn't reply to the two emails I sent on Wednesday until the Friday, after I had logded a withdrawal form for all my money!! I did this for the way I had been treated AND also when reading this page; [http://www.forexbastards.com/Fxdd.shtml](http://www.forexbastards.com/Fxdd.shtml)<o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

This may have been answered before, and if so, please direct me to said answer, but here's my question. We all know that FB trades bounce around a bit, and trades rarely start in profit to steam onto closing in profit without rebounding about 20 pips or so to the negative (at least in my experience). So why not combine the hedge trading of 1.0b with the automatic nature of 1.0c? I am running 1.0c right now, and it is doing quite well, but several of these trades would have done really well in the hedge format. I really like the way that 1.0c handles orders (I am a bit more aggressively styled than most people I would say), but man oh man what wonders you could do with a hedging ability on there too.

NOt sure about all your questions but here goes:  
  
Use the FB v1.0a available in the first post of this thread.  
On a thousand dollar mini lot I would trade four pairs at .25 mini lots. I am using the USDCHF, EURUSD, USDJPY, and USDCAD to good effect.  
Use the M5 charts. I think 25-250-25 is good. Percent setting is 0.1.  
  
When (we hope) your account grows to $2000 in equity simply change the lots traded to .5 minilots per pair. I use the old rule of 1 minilot per pair per $1000 in account equity. (That would be .1 lot on a standard account).   
  
Be mentally prepared for a drawdown at first. Mine sure did! About 20%. But for the first full month of live trading I have now netted 1060 pips.  
  
Obviously you will not be rich by next year on this method but your risk of margin calls should be minimal I would think.  
  
Good luck.

Great news on the live account.  
Sorry about the FXDD fiasco....  
  
Do you feel like the 63G or 63H03 is working best?  
  
Did you say you don't do the Trailing Stop? TS  
  
Are you keeping them going 24/7?  
  
Are you still using risk of 5.0 and 0.8 lots?  
  
I am anxious to hear your reply...  
  
Thanks

Hi Piece of the Pie,  
  
Really don't know about 63G or 63H03, it's early days. G was/is good, but the past two weeks on 15m MA and 5 min charts were very good on H. The O/T were so low and the profits were excellent.   
  
I ran with the T/S on 63G in the end, but 63H didn't have one until today thru' Wakema. Don't know if I shall use it yet.... One thing has been obvious, is it's far better to leave the EA alone. So now all my winning trades get 25pips. I run it 24/7 now on 1.25 mini lot size and on two accounts with the 5 pairs.

I won't lie, after a few beers, that's something a bit crazy to look at. It might not help that I have "Flock of Seagulls" music blaring in the background, but we all have our comfort zones. Obviously best of luck to you, because that means best of luck to me too, lol. To show what I mean, here's my chart depicting my situation right now.

Blewmoon,   
  
What do you speculate the problem was, with no trades for those 2 days?

Hey everyone, I have a few questions about Firebird that I would like to figure out before I go live with it.  
  
1) how does it handle interuptions in: power, internet connection, EA being turned off. Will it pick back up smoothly? Or will it forget about the trades it has placed before the interuption.   
  
2) Do most people turn off their PCs over the weekend, or let it run?  
  
3) Why does it look like, on my PC, that when FB places a pipstep order it doesn't average the previous orders and adjust the new TP level?   
  
Thanks  
Rusty

1\. all trades are logged on the server. I switch my PC off at nights and weekends, all orders are kept and executed if TP/SL is reached during PC downtime.  
2\. Each pipstep opens a separate trade and is not designed to adjust the previous one.

Since Thursday, Sept 27th, FB has produced 18 winners out of 22 completed demo trades based on one standard lot. Using v63g (added Wakena's TS yesterday) and v63H[04]ts.  
  
Two of the unsuccessful trades stopped out because SL=42. Both trades continued into profit, so I've increased SL=100. The other two stopped out based on max draw down, risk of 2%, to the tune of $551 and $621 (demo testing, 1 Lot). Risk reduced to 1%.  
  
Expect to go "live" next week, after a few more tweaks.

I let my Firebird run 24/5 but shut off my trading PC Friday afternoon and turn it back on Sunday evening when trading begins. I've studied the percentages Firebird gets with settings like 35-250-25 and it trades just as well or better than I do manually so I just let it run, without trying to "outthink" the EA.

Fellow Firebird'ers -  
  
This version includes the added level of protection of MinMarginLevel. I feel this is important especially for those of us that don't have much to open with.   
  
MinMarginLevel is good because you can set it to not open any trades once it hits a certain percentage. Why is this important? If your account falls below a certain percentage, your broker will either close all your positions or randomly close positions just to get you back over the margin level they decide. Margin level was new to me coming from RefcoFX and [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") because they went strictly by available margin (or Free Margin). If you ran out of margin, you got an instant margin call liquidating all your open positions.  
  
Each broker has a different policy and you'll need to contact them. I have already spoken personally with both FXDD and IBFX. Here are their policies:

FXDD: If margin level falls below 80%, all open positions will be closed  
  
IBFX: If margin level falls below 50%, they will randomly start closing positions until your margin level goes above 50%.  

When I first started to demo fb v1.0, I noticed way too many positions were being opened for the amount of margin I had and knew I wouldn't be comfortable with seeing that on a live account.  
  
The first step was turning on money management using microlots (IBFX) since I was opening with $350. I also had to make one small change in the UseMM math to make sure I was getting 30 cents a pip for 3 micro lots vs .03 cents a pip. ;-)   
  
The other step was implementing MinMarginLevel. I found fb v1.0c1 out on forex-tsd included MinMarginLevel for MAtype 0, but not for type 1. I have included it for type 1 as well. It works for both MA types now.  
  
MinMarginLevel and Money management should be 2 key ingredients with any EA.  
  
Since v1.0a didn't include money management or margin level protection, I have taken the liberty of including both in v1.0a.  
  
One additional note under UseMM (money management):  
  
The original code uses Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/1000;  
In order to make this work properly with IBFX and miniaccounts, I changed it to Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/100;  
  
If you are using FXDD, you'll want to change it back to Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/1000;  
  
I have found this helpful in protecting myself, I hope others find it useful as well.

Post number 1 of this thread. Firebird v 1.0a. The JPY pairs are fixed and there is nothing fancy.  
  
I like it.

No. You do not need a magic #. I, along with many, have forward tested v1.0a and v1.0c with IBFX extensively and no magic number is required. It's all properly coded in the EA.

From what I have read in most of the FB Documentation, FB was supposed to average the TP level of the pipstep orders. So that the trend FB was stuck in would only have to come back a portion of the way to break even. All the pipstep orders I have seen leave the original orders as-is. By the 3rd pipstep the first order has to come back 90 pips, where as if it was averaged it would only have to come back 45 pips, after that the 4 orders are in profit (first order and 3 pipsteps). I am not sure if the bug has been fixed (check the last few lines of the EA code). Am I right in this?? Fixing this might help with large drawdowns, and old trades effecting our margins.

Thanks Bill but I should have been more specific. Just trying to find out how to do it in the Account History window. So that I can tally up the total pips profit rather than dollars.

M5 worked well on a 5k demo account.  
  
I am going live with a mini hopefully by Monday with InterBank.  
  
Need a refresher on how many pairs I can trade with a beginning balance of $400 and any setting adjustments for FB 1.0a.  
  
Thanks...

Hi sinclap -  
  
If you're going to run v1.0a with a beginning balance of $400, I highly recommend using v1.0a1 which includes money management and min margin level protection. You can find v1.0a1 attached to my post..

Just started testing 63G-TS2, wondering if anyone else running this version has had any trades placed yet. Mine's yet to place any though looking at the charts with the indicator, shows a few possible entry points. But it's still early into the market open so we'll see what happens later. Just want to make sure I don't have anything configured wrong..  
  
thanks.

can you please post your set file, if you're using one. or just all the settings you're using. mine has yet to open any, however standard 63g-ts has. so i think something in my stettings is holding it back.

also is there anything special needed if i'm using an ibfx mini? this is my first test with them. all others had been with other brokers in standard accounts (which is also where regualr 63g-ts is working). hmm.

Well, just fyi. If you trade .03 lots when opening a mini demo, you'll actually be getting .03 cents a pip (on EUR/USD). With money management turned on, your fb ea should trade 0.40 lots or sometimes 0.30 lots which equates to .40 cents or .30 cents which is safe in my book. Also be aware that the default for risk is 10%. If you want your risk to be less than 10%, you'll need to modify that in the user settings which you can do when you first load the EA... or you can do after the fact by pressing F7.

Because some brokers, including IBFX, use the suffix "m" on Mini Accounts charts, all Firebird Fixed versions probably will not place order on jpy pairs.   
  
The code on all Fixed versions should have this modification. These include versions v1.0a, v1,0b(1,2,3), v1.0c(1).  
  
Existing code:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    if ((Symbol()=="EURJPY") || // FIXED BY SKYLINE ON 11 Aug 2006
     (Symbol()=="USDJPY") ||
     (Symbol()=="CHFJPY") ||
     (Symbol()=="AUDJPY") || 
     (Symbol()=="CADJPY") || 
     (Symbol()=="NZDJPY") || 
     (Symbol()=="GBPJPY") ||
     (Symbol()=="SGDJPY"))

  
Change above code to:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    if ((Symbol()=="EURJPY") || (Symbol()=="EURJPYm") || // FIXED BY SKYLINE ON 11 Aug 2006
     (Symbol()=="USDJPY") || (Symbol()=="USDJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="CHFJPY") || (Symbol()=="CHFJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="AUDJPY") || (Symbol()=="AUDJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="CADJPY") || (Symbol()=="CADJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="NZDJPY") || (Symbol()=="NZDJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="GBPJPY") || (Symbol()=="GBPJPYm") ||
     (Symbol()=="SGDJPY") || (Symbol()=="SGDJPYm"))

and thanks wackena, i read about the jpy pairs over in the phoenix 2007 thread, however right now i'm not trading any of those. i'm currently set on usdchf, usdcad, and eurusd. chf and euro on 1minutes; cad on 5minutes. still nothing going on.  
  
i'm confused by it all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) any help is appreciated.

Wackena,  
  
Question:  
  
I've noticed a number of trades taking profits in both versions (v63 TS and v63H-ts) but TP wasn't reached. Shows as pink in the MT4 account history. Presumably, Firebird intentionally revises SL to a profit number less than the TP and exits early for profit? This morning alone, I'm showing more than $500 in profit on 4 trades due to these early exits. It cannot be the TS function since the SL is 100 or more pips away. Not complaining, just that in all my getting, I like gaining understanding.   
  
Please confirm. Thanks.

that is the TS doing that, looking at your setting above, your TS is 10, such that, when the price moves 10pips in profit your SL gets reassigned to breakeven, as it moves more into profit the the SL keeps getting moved up and up with it, so eventually if there is a reversal, it will hit the newly defined SL which is actually in profit thanks to the TS.

Thanks rideblitz,  
  
Obviously I didn't consider the change of SL to BE which certainly explains it because otherwise the SL is so distant, the TS would have no impact. Of the last 10 trades closed by FB, all winners, five closed due to the TS routine. Each of the trades I shared with you yesterday closed in profit this morning It works like a charm!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

No problem. Glad everything going good for you.  
  
And, I got one trade out of it finally for usdchf, but just the one, its currently still open. I changed percent from 0.1 to 0.05. though i usually like 0.1 but if it works on .05 i'm happy.  
  
oh whats the sound? just opened a new trade on usdcad![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) i think it's finally coming in to play, took it long enough, only 2 trades in ~15hours. hping for better things to come, also i just realized today is technically a holiday so market volume is probably pretty low right now.

Presumably, Firebird intentionally revises SL to a profit number less than the TP and exits early for profit? This morning alone, I'm showing more than $500 in profit on 4 trades due to these early exits. It cannot be the TS function since the SL is 100 or more pips away. Not complaining, just that in all my getting, I like gaining understanding.

MoneyMa$ter,   
  
t/s has a catch 22. The good point is that it can secure profits if price does not quite reach t/p. It does this just as you described above. The catch 22 is that after s/l is set by t/s, then price reverses a little before proceeding. the s/l can be trigger by the reverse and then potential t/p profit is not gained. With FB type EAs, I've found the s/l to be beneficial as many times price will reverse strongly before reaching t/p. Without t/s and s/l of 300, orders can stay open a long time. Using t/s closes many orders so new order can be opened.  
  
Just my opinion.

I had the same result when I switched from 0.1 to .05 - more trades. Also running everything on 1M charts, except cable and Euro both of which are on 5m charts.

Your opinion is always appreciated here, Wackena.  
  
Trading standard lots, I'd rather have more trades with shorter profit runs [it's the newstrader in me!]. Also avoids potentially huge losses. BTW, FB took the full 100 pip loss (Demo) during NFP (Euro; $/chf and Gbp/jpy). Just another learning opportunity see success (loss).  
  
By comparison, trading minis and micros, each trade would stay open a longer time and each trade would garner more pips so it probably works out roughly the same in terms of real dollar profits.

Hi dscott5912,  
  
I was able to go live today on three currency pairs using the 1.0a1. The pairs are USD/EUR, USD/CHF and USD/CAD which works best.  
  
What pairs work best for 1.0c?  
  
Thanks..

**Firebird October 3 to October 9, 12:30 pm est, on SBFX MT4** :  
  
A. 12 consecutive winners back to October 6, including five today  
  
B. Traded six USD pairs with v63g-TS and six non-USD withv63H[04]-TS:  
  
Usd/jpy Usd/cad Usd/chf Aud/usd Gbp/usd Eur/usd.  
  
C. Traded Six non-USD pairs with v63H[04] and TS added by Wackena:  
  
Eur/gbp Eur/chf Eur/jpy Gbp/chf Eur/aud Gbp/jpy.  
  
**RESULTS:**  
  
$7,273.36 Profit  
  
$5,769.23 Losses  
  
**ANALYSIS OF LOSSES**  
  
(a) $3,535.10 "NFP-losses" accounted for more than 60% of the loss, trades were open prior to NFP and itemized as follows:  
2 Eur/usd trades for -$1,000 each and one Eur/aud at -$742.90 one Usd/chf at -$792.20 all trades directly attributable to remaining in market during NFP. Conclusion: terminate FB 24 hours prior to NFP or alternatively, terminate trading the majors 24 hours prior.  
  
(b) -$851.14 gbp/jpy; this pair has been eliminated from trading  
  
(c) -$1,382.99 with 42 pip SL; too close; SL now set at 100.  
  
**Current v63g TS Settings** :  
  
Percent .05  
1 standard lot  
TS 10  
TP 50  
SL 100   
MM 0  
Max00 2  
  
**Current v63H[04]TS settings** :  
  
TP 25  
MaxOpenOrders 4  
Pipstep 40  
Everything else is the same as v63g.  
  
Perhaps I'll ask staff to determine the number of pips but right now, it's Time to go "live"!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi All ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
First loss trade hit today for me in forward demo test started on 1 Aug 2006 using Firebird v0.63g with 30-300-30 settings on USDJPY ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)   
Anyway my demo account starting with 10000$ is still good enough now at 13310$ with 141 consecutive winning trade (about 4230 pips) and as i said only 1 losing trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
I think it's really difficult to find a manual forex trader that can have these performance, am I right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Traderone,  
  
I'm leaning toward v63g-TS but I want to study the results to determine which performed the "better" of the two. Also thinking of switching EAs: H04 on US pairs; and v63gTS on the remainder.

how do you like .05 percent compared to .1, i know it gives more trades, but are the "quality of the trade" still good? as in not a lot of false signals?  
  
and how do you like the Euro on 5minute? i usually use 1min, but have good luck with usdcad on 5min, so am exploring the idea of trying the Euro on 5min.  
  
thanks for all the help the past day or so ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

**Percent** controls the quantity of trades because it relates to price action outside the band created by FireBird: further from the band, fewer trades. **Quality** is a function of the other settings, such as lotsize, TF, TP, TS and SL. Getting the settings right is akin to determining the combination to a vault - once all the chambers align the door opens and the vault yields its riches.  
  
So to answer your question, I think I've found a high percentage of quality trades because I've tinkered with settings, finding a great combination for standard lots. Fully sixty percent of my losses were "NFP induced"; another 20% or so were due to a tight SL of 42 which doesn't work for me. Eliminating the "NFP induced" losses and changing the SL significantly improved the trade quality.  
  
Highly volatile pairs I think should be traded on 5 min (or higher??) charts. That's explained in the thread somewhere and I think it's true. Some traders stay away from the volatile pairs (that's probably the longest timeframe ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)).

All you guys out there. I've done away with Money Management.  
  
I hope when it is turned off the TS and other functions still work.  
  
I put FB V1.0C1 on 3 currencies last night.  
In two minutes it placed 10 standard Lots on Euro/Chf on $10k demo.  
  
A 50 pip movement would wipe the account out at about $200 a pip.  
  
Phoenix on another currency with MM opened 0.5 Lots.  
\---  
I'm running:  
FB HO4 TS MM  
Phoenix 4.2  
FB 1A  
FB 1.0C1  
over 9 currency pairs.  
  
Too much concern with money management, so manual is easier.  
  
\-----------------------------------------------------------  
My account History never works. I need help.  
  
I used to use IBFX, and stopped months ago.  
Trades would finish and only about half turned up in Account History.  
  
I have been using FXDD demos ever since, but still 1/4 - 1/2 of trades do not go to Account History. And after a week no trades remain there.  
  
My North Finance live account does the same thing. It shows no account history after a few days.  
  
  
All you people keep putting files of your trades up, but i cannot even view mine. Are there setting i need to change?  
I'd like to share my trades as well.

When you get a new demo each month with IBFX the history is gone. On a live account or a demo that does not expire all history should be there.  
  
With the terminal window open select the 'account history' tab right mouse click over the trades in history and select 'all history' from the mouse pop-up menu. You should see all history including deposits. If you do not I would complain loud and long to the broker on a live account. When you right click there are other periods you can select including custom periods. When ever we start a new month my live accounts, by default, only show the current month until I right click and select a longer history period. It somtimes takes several seconds after you select 'all history' to display properly if you have had the account for a long time.

Hello to everyone  
  
Im testing FB v63H04, FB v63G and FB v1A all on 5min TF. I found different input values of MA_length, MA_timeframe and DivergenceLimit between them.  
  
Are you using the default value that comes with the EA?

For those of you interested in using money management and/or margin level protection with v63H03, I have included it.  
  
You have the option of turning either one off or on when you first load it (or afterwards by pressing F7) on the "Inputs" tab. One cautionary note under money management. If you are using a miniaccount with IBFX, the formula coded in the UseMM routine will work correctly. If you are using a miniaccount with another broker, like FXDD, you will need to change the following code from ...  
  
Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/100; // specific for minilots with IBFX  
  
to ...  
  
Lots=AccountEquity()* Risk/100/**1000** ; // other broker like FXDD  
  
IBFX calculates this a bit different on a mini is why.

Results for October 10, 2006:  
  
Trading 1 lot, demo. **Six trades closed, each opened today, for a total of 168 pips.** No losers. All six were v63H[04]-TS. Settings posted earlier in this thread.  
  
Interesting day in that currency pairs were trending, dollar strengthening. At one time, float was **-$3,800.00** ; currently **-$2,370.00**. Good thing is everything closing generated a profit. Several very negative pairs trading in the float but I expect this to turn around, as that's the general history of Firebird (although on several occasions, the full 100 pip SL was hit.

See my posts numbered 1186 and 1196 in this thread.   
  
And you're trading how many currencies? I'm trading 12 pairs, most on 1 minute charts. But read the earlier posts and you'll have the answers to your questions.

In two days only had 5 trades open, and none with Ho4 ts.  
  
all trades hit SL (phoenix), v10c1 manually closed breakeven  
  
FB 1a opened two trades US/Jap floating down  
phoenix opened Euro/Jap floating down.  
  
FB's running M5  
phoenix M15  
  
more trades should be opening i think, after seeing other's [FBs](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") trading...

My Firebird is stuck!  
  
Ok here it is, I had FB running on USDCHF & EURUSD, it went Long on EURUSD, and Short on USDCHF. The problem is that it there is 4-5 open orders of each. FB went chasing the trend on Tuesday Morning (EST), and I now have about 5% of my Equity in each of those pairs, so about 10% of it tied up at the moment. (this is on a small live mini account) Am I correct in saying that the USD got stronger , and until it reverses a bit I am going to be stuck with these open trades. Would it be better to close them out and start clean? How long before the $$ reverses a little? But more importantly, why did FB try to keep chasing the trend? And what can I do to prevent this in the future?

I was 100% up on equity on the franc before NFP, now 90% down. Would have all been avoided if i'd stuck to the rules and closed it all down last wednesday. an expensive lesson.

Well.... cgldsmth, I'm not down 90% but I must admit that the NFP dealt my account some pretty bad blows. Now showing a loss in equity instead of a gain. Doesn't seem to be coming around either!  
  
I'm thinking about actually closing all the trades made last week and letting things kinda start over.  
  
What do you mean about sticking to the rules? I hadn't heard of any rules about NFP. Hmmm.

Yeah I think that's correct. Either close FB 24 hours before NFP to prevent new trades opening OR stop trading the majors. My demo trading suffered two SL hits at 100 pips each, both in majors.

i stopped FB from enetering NEW trades 3 days before NFP but left open trades going - that's what killed it. Was using the hedge version so had 10 either side of price. Was also over-leveraged due to reckless enthusiasm.  
  
now converted to H04-TSMM with small risk.  
  
I'm sure there's a sweet-spot out there.

Demo trading, **five trades closed, all in profit, total of 45 pips.** No losers. All opened today, all closed today. Four trades through v63H[04]TS, one trade with v63gTS. Each trade closed via FB's moving SL to BE as opposed to hitting TP.

I only have one issue with FB - when prices steadily trend opposite the trade's opening price, it **may** continue until SL. I believe the divergence function is meant to protect against trending markets. However, I'm not seeing much protection as several currencies continued to my SL 100 (a loss of $1,000 demo using standard lot).  
  
I'm an old PL1 programmer (IBM 360/370 days) so my revisions below may be out in left field. Like to get your thoughts:  
  
extern double DivergenceLimit=0.001; // modified from .002 to .001 by MoneyMa$ter  
extern bool Use_V63D_Divergence = 0; // 0 - Use original method for divergence, 1 - use in iFXAnalyzer Modified by MoneyMa$ter  
extern int PipStep = 40; //if position goes this amount of pips against you add another.  
extern double IncreasementType = 0; //0=just add every PipStep, >0 =OrdersToal()^x *Pipstep  
extern int DVLimit = 5; // included by Renato modified from 10 to 5 by MoneyMa$ter.  
  
Thanks in advance for your time and input.

With that said, would I then be correct in saying the smaller the percentage the closer to the band.. hence more trades?  
  
For example: In v1.0c "Percent" is 0.1. In v63H04-TS "Percent" is 0.05.   
  
In that scenario, would a Percent of 0.05 execute trades closer to the band?

That's affirmative. Closer to the band, hence more trades.

Ah.. It would be interesting to do a direct comparison between percent=0.1 vs 0.05 over at least 1 month.  
  
Has anyone in the forum done that? Anyone, anyone ... (Bueller?) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

As others have stated, lowering the percentage generates more orders. This mainly applies to 1st order on chart. After 1st order, remaining multiple chart orders only trigger when price reaches PipStep setting. So, even if Envelope and RVI triggers are made, the order will not be placed until PipStep is reached.

Firebird closed 14 trades today, 13 were winners (+235) and 1 major loser   
(-100). Net 135 pips for today. Not too shabby but that minus 100 must go.

MOneyma$ter, how much float are you carrying on your Firebirds? I know you closed 14 trades, but are even more still open?  
  
I had to close down my live account for the first time in over a month. Was afraid I would lose my shirt, then of course the action turned around after I closed out. Sigh. Can't decide whether to crank it up again or not.  
  
By the way Moneyma$ter.... don't worry too much about that 100 pip loser. I had TWO for 300 pips each..........

I am fairly new to firebird and do not understand the intricacies of exactly how it operates under the hood like those that have been involved for a long time. I have found I have many questions that could be answered if there was a write-up or FAQ's page. I believe that would be helpful for many.  
  
I have read the top portion of the EA which gives the overall idea behind the logic. Some example terms that would be valuable to the user community would be ...   
  

  1. MA_length
  2. MA_timeframe
  3. Percent
  4. Slip
  5. DivergenceLimit

The more information the better. A value that was recently discussed was "Percent". I learned the smaller the value, the closer to the envelope trades would be executed. Hence, more trades. However, it would be valuable to explain the term envelope for those of us who are not up to speed and further explain if it is more advantageous to stay closer to the envelope.

Hi there !  
  
well guys ... this is question of the staring time of this bird... I also see it at my live and demo accounts, some of them are floating kings others close one order after the other...  
  
It´s a question of the starting time, i don´t think that we can fix this problem...  
  
Hope this helps,

If you can find Accrete's homepage he has a pdf file that discusses all about the firebird. Also, go to the original thread where Mono was most active for some more thoughts on settings etc.  
  
  
  
I think the name of that thread was "please test this EA (firebird)" . It is still active here farther down the page.

Wackena,  
  
As others in this thread, I was stopped out on two 300 pip trades in USD/CHF and manually closed out others (~600 pips additional) for a fairly substantial loss ($4000-$5000...fortunately demo).   
  
Lately, I've been thinking about automatically closing orders that are older than 14 days and/or x amount of pips away from TP (say 150). How difficult would this be to program in to 63H04_TS? In order for this to occur, both parameters would have to be met. In addition, I think that adding money management like v.1c would help to keep from being to aggressive with increasing lot size.  
  
I realize that adding the above may result in losses that may have reversed later to TP, but usually they don't after they are that far away. Any help in programming this would be appreciated.

Mr. Trader,  
  
Could you please expand on this? What do you mean by starting time. In relation to the trend of the chart, or time of day?  
  
Thanks  
Rusty

Greetings all : )   
  
WOW, i'm just back from holiday and came home to over 4,300 new posts! No way i can easily catch up with all that reading, but wanted to say that our resource page now has the 63H04 and TS versions up there. I didn't make time to upload them before my exodus last week but the page is up to date now.  
  
I'm glad to read of all the good trades our FB has given those in forward and live testing. I shut everything down before leaving, but i'm contemplating spending the few dollars a month for a virtual server so i won't have to bother with leaving a PC on at home when i go away ( : which i like to do often since my employer spoils me w/over 6 weeks of paid time off a year : )  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Traderone,  
  
My apologies for the late response. Just getting to a binary-based, table-top accessory (aka laptop); buying crude all evening! Russian D2 to be exact. But I digress.  
  
I was demo-trading 12 currency pairs on a standard lot so float got relatively high, like $2000-$3000. But that also included FLYER! test lots. Yes there were still open pairs trading that I manually closed. Trading universe now reduced to 8 (fib?) with a goal of 6 pairs for live trading.  
  
I've contributed (don't like the "L" word) as high as $16,000 in a single trade (live) so I'm not really concerned about 100 pips. I think it can be avoided however. **Those losses seemed to occur because the trade opened by FB never moved into profit which, had the trade moved far enough in profit, would have allowed a revision of the SL to BE. Major losses (100 pips in my test-cases) happened because the trade opened and went straight south (or north) to the SL.** I had numerous trades close in profit because FB moved SL to BE. Didn't make TP but made a profit. And that's the name of the game. Profit.  
  
**Possible solution:** if trade never moved into profit, or if entry price is never exceeded and current price hits a predetermined point defined by trader, like negative 65 pips for example (or less) from the entry, then program FB to liquidate the trade. Differs from a pure SL because in my scenario if prices did initially move toward profit, then there's a chance the trend will reverse and become profitable again. But when prices immediately move to loss territory, it seems to continue all the way unabated to SL. I'd like to liquidate before the full SL is hit.

No MoneyMa$ter, I knew you weren't worried about the 100 pips. I was just kidding a little. (If I can do that on a day that I lose two 300 pip trades![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)).  
  
I appreciate your thoughts on this and have often wondered about lowering the SL (why just hang around with a bad trade forever?). Also wondered about lowering the TP a little. Perhaps the TS versions are a good choice. If and when a start up again I might go with the H04_TS.  
  
And true to my usual style, after closing manually all my big losing open trades, the market immediately reversed and would have restored around half of my losses. Typical.

Just use 0.1 lot on a mini account and you've got micro.

Differs from a pure SL because in my scenario if prices did initially move toward profit, then there's a chance the trend will reverse and become profitable again. But when prices immediately move to loss territory, it seems to continue all the way unabated to SL. I'd like to liquidate before the full SL is hit.

This is an interesting idea

FB-TS and fixed versions has sub-routines that are not used, CloseTheseTrades() and CloseLoosingTrades() .  
  
CloseTheseTrades() will just close all trades. I believe this was intended to be used in an end of week or bad trading time routine to close all orders.  
  
CloseLoosingTrades() uses a Trend indicator based on H4 timeframe to exit orders when a strong trend is detected. This sub-routine could be modified to close orders that have been open for X amount of time and has X amount of loss. I'm not aware as to how to track if order was in profit at one time, but at some later time it is in loss. I could only code EA to trigger an action on conditions at one period of time.

Wackena,  
  
Lets try it and see where it takes us. I also like Moneymasters idea, but sounds like programming might be an issue. Thanks for responding.

Ditto. So all we need do is remove "void" before the appropriate subroutine, then compile and test.

Gico,  
  
No back test, this is a REAL account. The FB versions are all on this site and the other one. The latest 63H04 TS is [I think] by Wakena. And my settups are as posted before, basically the MONO setting but NOW on 5 MIN Chart with a 320 Stop Loss and with a T/S...  
  
I suggest you have a "Basketful" of pairs [without Cable] and try FORWARD testing on a DEMO will various versions..  
  
Good luck  
  
PS I have never tried/or used version 1a

Blewmoon,  
  
Simply outstanding results!! Congratulations. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
Now if I can just find the comparable settings for 1 lot trades. Can you imagine the float or the margin using a 320 pip SL on a standard lot and multiple open trades? Not a pretty sight. And definitely NO CABLE!

Thanks MoneyMa$ter, but it is all FB, I just watch the screen!!  
  
I am working up to 1 BIG Lot by having several Broker accounts all having a Mini account. I have 3 at the moment with various setting and I am up 1.4 of a Mini lot with them. Thinking about the 320p Stop Loss makes my eyes water, but it seems to work.   
  
I have been trading nearly 8 years [seaching these past few years for an auto system] and when it was first suggested [300S/L], I nearly flipped and I said "it'll NEVER work!!!" But 'Hats Off' to Mono and everyone in the FB Forums.  
  
BTW The start of this week was a diaster. As well as getting my second loss the O/T went ballistic [they have returned to "normal" now], but at the same time I opened my 3rd account.  
  
To make matters worse, PFG FX, opened my account with a Big Lot instead of a Mini [the same thing happened with FXDD last month!]. In a few minutes I was $1,100 down on $/Can... I quickly stopped the EA and I am trying to get it back into credit before opening the EA again... Such is life...

I posted this a few days ago, but haven't heard from anyone about this. Has anyone else seen this effect with starting times??   
After a so-so week I am hoping next week will be better.

OK. I will code EA with 2 new inputs. 1st to set elapsed time before closing order and 2nd to set loss level. Both will need to be made before closing order.

Wackena,  
  
Could you also include the money management routine like 1c has if possible and not too much trouble. Much appreciated. Don't know what we'd do without you...

OK, we need i think one more version of FB to make it a baker's dozen ; )  
Have wakena's latest version (from his post #1277) now up at our [FireBird Resource Page](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/).  
  
Have a good weekend all. I will also, as many of you will, begin testing FB2 at market open. This week my single day of trading (was on holiday) during Thursday with vH04TS brought in 200 pips with -40 pip float as i post this Friday afternoon NY time.

"Save the Wackena Fund" or "Fred's Labrador Retreiver College Fund: Fred is my Yellow Lab. Both shoud be fully tax deductable.

Great. Thanks for this Wackena.  
  
But................  
  
What are we going to use for the number of hours before close?  
How about a tolerable loss number for pips?  
  
I'm thinking 120 hours (5 days) and maybe 80 pips.  
Time enough to get over a few announcements and not enough pips to kill the account.  
  
Any ideas here?  
  
Also, has anybody here done anything really zany like run Firebird on a 1 hour chart or H4 or Daily? Weird, but what the hey?

I got a PM that pointed out a flaw that I missed in the UseMM routine in FB-v2.0. The previous EA posted will work OK, but can have problem with some Broker's mini or standard that do not allow uneven lot sizes. Example: 0.18 lot size is not allowed. It would need to be 0.2.   
  
I kept the same name for the EA.   
  
**SO EVERYONE PLEASED BE AWARE THAT THE PREVIOUS POSTED EA COULD HAVE PROBLEM WITH SOME BROKERS.**

Got family in Garner. We built the first school house and church for black folks back in the 19th century. Owned quite a bit of Raleigh's suburbs until the fifties when my uncle the lawyer sold it for subdivision. All that tract housing over there? Owned it.

Appleparty,  
  
_Give_ a man an apple to eat and he's dependent on you for life. _Teach_ a man how to plant appleseeds and he can feed himself, his family and his entire community.....  
  
Can you read at least **some** of the thread? That will _teach_ you and help you understand how the EA works. The answer to your question is not that far away.

tow weeks test,i think it's can tell us something.  
the broke is IFX,and FXDD have the same result  
the version is FB v63G   
the timefram is 30M (1/2 hour)  
Lot=0.1 ~ 0.2  
TP=24 (mabe some pairs can bigger)  
SL=300  
PS=30  
  
test is good,but it is not good for USDCAD,and it do not trde GBPUSD(mabe its not satisfy for 30M), i think it the reason is market news.i will wait last week.  
  
it takes 300pips in first week,but the 2nd week ,it makes pips hard.  
  
that my report.

I could not find the time frame in the thread for FB 2. I am currently using 30M for FB 1.0a  
  
If you know, please post. Would like to test on a demo account.

Allow me one point:  
  
(1) It's possible that **YOU** could discover something new. Use anything; play around with it and vary the timeframes. _That's why we call it "testing on a demo account"._  
  
Now to your question:  
  
FB 2 is the original FB, plus the addition of MoneyManagement and Trailing Stop, plus correction for the yen pairs, plus the new features Wackena just added. So whatever timeframe you used successfully in the past can still be used in the future.  
  
Works like this:  
  
(1) Shorter TFs result in more trades;   
(2) Longer TFs result in fewer trades.   
(3) Conversely, smaller Percents, more trades and higher percents, fewer trades.   
(4) Some traders use TF of 1 minute, others use 5 minutes, others use higher TFs like 30 for the more volatile pairs such as cable; still others avoid cable altogether.  
(5) For standard lots, I'm testing with 5m charts a 1m charts produced quite a few trades and a correspondingly high float. Definitely avoiding cable.  
  
Cheery-o. Good hunting and all that sort of rot.

Very True..Trial and error on a demo is the only way to learn to fit ones style.  
  
I made a mistake with the time element I use with FB on a real account. I use 5M not 30 M.

Is it possible to disable FB on one of the currency pairs while having open trades to run it's course?

Below is a 2 month forward demo test of FB v1.0a as well as the results for the first month. There has been an equity loss of about $800.00 over the last month but overall it is still profitable. I decided to stop testing it and quit trading it live in my baby account for now. I'll have to see if next summer is the same as this past summer. If it is I'll turn this EA back on from June to the end of August. During that period it did very well. This test was on 5min charts. After a month I dropped the some of the GBP pairs. The settings are at the end of the PDF file.

hi all,  
  
Look, i hate to be a damp squib for you lot on here using this, but i felt I had to give out a warning and maybe open some eyes.  
  
why? well i can see the same situation arising that happened a few weeks ago - everything swimming along nicely, everyone demo testing and making loadsa pips - gaining confidence, feeling invincible. The went on for about 6 weeks or more.  
  
just as everone started opening live accounts the market went trendy and lots lost a bundle.  
  
Now the reason i'm saying this is that thereare a lot of new faces on here and i don't want you to get burned.  
  
Now, for opening your eyes. - some will remain blinkered  
  
The reason you like this strategy and the reason it is so popular is this.  
  
You never have to take a loss. - thats why newbies and unseasoned traders flock to this like a moth to a flame.  
  
But it's not real. You do take a loss ..... eventually. and its a total loss.  
  
what happens is that as you are watching this you see lots of green on your account balance page so you feel invincible. - even seeing some people take 100 pip losers has no impact because you are making hundreds more right?  
  
well, ignore that page and concentrate on what has become known as 'the float'  
  
The account equity is the most important figure to watch when you are using firebird. - it's here that you will see your drawdown - how many of you would really play a strategy if someone said to you - you will have to put up with a 50% drawdown though"  
  
well thats exactly what happens with firebird - watch that float figure because that is your indcation of drawdown. and one day, it wont stop.  
  
Don't get me wrong, this is certainly intruiging and as a trader it's really interested me following your progress over the past few months.  
  
But i have to tell you it is fools gold and is not tradable.  
  
The second reason it seems attractive is that it appears to make hundreds of pips a week or day. The thing is that because you cannot play it at the same staking level as other strategies is that you have to account for this.  
  
For example. lets say that you have a strategy that makes 200 pips a month on a single pair - pretty low you may think but thats your inexperience speaking.  
  
However this 200 pips you can comfortably play at $10 a pip on a $10k account (thats 10:1 leverage).  
  
with firebird lets say that you are only comfortable enough to play it at $1 a pip because of the 'float' as you call it - drawdown as i call it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
well, that means that it has to make 2000 pips a month to give the same monetary result as to 200 pip strategy - see what i mean?  
  
If you could comfortably play firebird at $10 a pip on one pair then i'd say it was great - even if it will bite your bum eventually. But because you can only play it at flat (ie zero) leverage then i would plump for the 200 pip strategy every time.  
  
Now i know some have been on here saying that you should play $1 for every $1k in your account - but believe me, you will soon die if you do that.  
  
So, just a word of warning and dont come running to me when it happens.

Two Points:  
  
(1) Count it quite simply as the cost of doing business. As an entrepreneur, I understand and accept the costs and risks involved. For example, while SL 300 may work for micros and minis, I think SL 300 is an inappropriate risk for trading standard lots. So the obvious thing to do is reduce the SL for standard lot trading.   
  
(2) Understand there are many well-educated, experienced and creative traders at FF more than capable of first, identifying then second, overcoming FB's shortcomings. Consider the following example. Original FB could trend until it hit your SL; at 300 that could be a pretty good hit. Wackena modified the program to reduce such losses.   
  
It's rather naive to think you'll operate any nascent business without a loss. And an EA less than a year old is akin to a new business. The question cabletrader is how much loss is acceptable and how do you minimize those losses. Furthermore, none of us think this or any EA will always and forever operate perfectly without observation and modification, fine tuning so to speak, in order to derive maximum efficient operation.  
  
Don't ever give up; don't ever quit. Quitting is the easy way out and for some, quitting is simply not an option. Rather use your mind and contribute constructive criticism that will improve the project. That means highlight the shortcomings, then recommend a solution.  
  
Adapt, improvise and dominate.

Good post MM and i agree w/you. I've found that, for better or worse, and i'm still licking my wounds, that even the worst weeks of my EA portfolio does hundreds of pips more in profit than my only-human trading model. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the human heart in the mind of the machine, but that will come in time. . .and that surely due in part from all the great ppl i rub elbows with here at the factory.

This morning, as of 11:15 am est, FB closed 15 trades, all in profit, total of 154 pips, standard lots, using 5 minute charts, no cable. Current float approx -$900. Maybe I'll try 1M.  
  
IMHCO, ("C" is for conservative) a system generating $1,500 - $3,000 profit per day, against $900 - $1,200 in negative float is a winning system. Truth is you realize profit daily, while the negative float doesn't offset profits unless and until the trader decides to close those open trades at the end of the week or prior to a major announcement such as NFP. So conservatively speaking, 4 days at an average of $2,000/day is $8,000, less the closing day negative float of let's say $1,500, leaves a net of $6,500 for a week's work or around 25 large per month.  
  
Slow compared to newstrading but steady. And the name of the game is "profit"!!! Like I said last week, it's the fully loaded FB (MM, TS, Close Losers, Close open too long, Yen corrected), a virtual pip mobile, unstoppable, low on gas and environmentally friendly!  
  
BTW, the only reason I haven't gone live is because one of my brokers, my only MT4 broker, had issues, COESFx - SpotTrader. Can't wait to get this baby on the autobahn and let'er rip, wide open, mach 3, hair on fire and mind on Go FAST!!!>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Hi MM,  
  
Please post the version you are using, either name or file. I know it's an H variant, and I'm sure I have it on my HD, but I've so many versions it's getting a bit confusing.  
  
Thanks,

Right you are.  
  
I'm testing for standard lots:  
  
(1) the hedge version with trailing stop referred to as v63-H[04]TS and   
  
(2) the latest v63, now referred to as v2. See Wackena's post #1277 in this thread for v.2; this is what I refer to as the load FB and it's the version that closed most of the trades.

Thank you. And I have to apologize, after rereading some of your earlier posts, you do indicate the use of v2.  
  
What settings are you using for the new routines added by Wackena?

That's a matter of personal preference. If you employ SL 100, how far are _you_ willing to go before cutting losses? Similarly, how many days do _you_ think a trade should remain open? Personal preferences. Try various combinations while you test the EA.

Well, knowing that "50% of the trades last a day. 45% 2-6 days 5% longer or just fail." It makes sense to study the losers, and find a pattern, if possible, and employ settings that take advantage of any patterning found. You're right, personal preference and independent testing are required.

Hi cabletrader,  
  
Do you speak from personal experience in regards to firebird 'blowing up' ?  
  
If so, could you provide specifics?  
  
thanks,

Everything I touch prospers. Everything! Son, I know how to overcome adversity because success is what I expect. I have the Blessing of Abraham on my life. I've dropped more cash investing than you will probably ever make in your lifetime. But deep down inside, I know you wish me well. Deep down inside, you wish you could do what I do. In fact, you probably wish you were me!! **![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)**And that's a good thing!

Let's see if this works.   
  
Be advised the negative closed trades and the cable profit for $800 and change came from other EAs I'm testing on the same platform.

Actually Chad, I did. See my post #1292 in this thread where I reported today's morning results. But because you helped me with that simple solution of attaching results, here's what I said:  
  
  
I'm testing for standard lots:  
  
(1) the hedge version with trailing stop referred to as v63-H[04]TS and   
  
(2) the latest v63, now referred to as v2. See Wackena's post #1277 in this thread for v.2; this is what I refer to as the load FB and it's the version that closed most of the trades.<!-- / message --><!-- sig -->

To Money Master & Horace Kent, et al  
  
I took the v63gH04_TS version and added the MM & Closing features of the new v2.0, simply because I wanted to keep the Safe Area feature on H04 that Wackena didn't include in the new version. I have found that over several months that this version performed 30% better than the v1b3 I was comparing it against. Just a personal preference. I just did a copy/paste between the two versions. I just started a new $5000 account with all the new settings and will keep you posted.

Money Master,  
  
v63H04_TS is a non-hedging version of FB. The hedging version is v1.03b. You can refer to the following web site to learn the particulars of all the versions.

Excuse me Mike, didn't I say non - hedge??? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1) So what does the "H" stand for since it's not hedging? Inquiring minds want to know.

To Fellow Firebirders,  
  
Yes, your account can "blow Up." My live account went from a modest $2800 to $5600 in about 5 weeks. I thought FB & I were invincible and I couldn't lose. I began over risking and trading too many pairs. And of course at the worst possible time when I doubled all of my lot sizes, the summer ranging ended and the trend began. The float quickly ate me up, and I manually had to close trades to prevent a margin call with all trades closing. It took me all the way down to $1200 in about 4 days.   
  
I continue to believe in Firebird, but I have a new respect for it and have a better understanding of it. I will be "wiser" next time.   
  
I think it behooves all of us to **respect the market**. It has a life of its own. The market is the "shark" and we are the "prey." We have to learn to swim faster and smarter so that we can become bigger and survive within it. God wants us to succeed in life, but He has lessons for each of us to learn. Sometimes God humbles us through our pain (whether it be through loss of money, fortune or fame). One's life can change in an instant (through illness, death of a loved one or our own.) Remember, that God owns everthing including the money He has entrusted to you to use for your benefit (or if you choose your demise) and your family's. I have lost a lot of money in the markets (options, stocks, Forex), probably money I may never recover. But it has taught me lessons...a tuition of sorts if you may. Tread the markets with caution, tend toward the conservative side, think outside the box, recognize an opportunity when it arises, and on and on. Just a little philosophy for the day...

MoneyMaster,  
  
"H" comes after "G". HeHe. Actually, Hendrick added the safe area and he assigned this letter to it to differentiate it from the g version. Hendrick is the author of Phoenix by the way.

I'm sorry for whatever you've experienced in life Mike. However, and I can't speak for you good buddy, but I've been given dominion over everything in this earth....including markets and sharks. No victims here.  
  
God is good. All the time. Death, pain and toil entered the world because of a man's mistake through deception. Look it up; it says so in Genesis. The deceiver, not God is the author of pain in life... if God was then He couldn't be good all the time. Would leave me wondering, well what's He gonna do to me today?? What lesson am I getting punished for now?? Nope. That is _not_ God. He wants me to be in health and prosper, even as my soul prospers. Look it up.  
  
The only thing pain is good for to let you know you're still alive.   
  
Anyway back to FireBird and its iterations. I like it. It works. Just like anything else it requires continuous monitoring for adjustments as the market evolves.  
  
Adapt. Improvise. Dominate. As Darwin said, "Only the fit get outta here alive!" or some such rot.

>  Yes, your account can "blow Up." My live account went from a modest $2800 to $5600 in about 5 weeks. I thought FB & I were invincible and I couldn't lose. I began over risking and trading too many pairs. And of course at the worst possible time when I doubled all of my lot sizes, the summer ranging ended and the trend began. The float quickly ate me up, and I manually had to close trades to prevent a margin call with all trades closing. It took me all the way down to $1200 in about 4 days.

We have to learn to swim faster and smarter so that we can become bigger and survive within it. God wants us to succeed in life, but He has lessons for each of us to learn.

Remember, that God owns everthing including the money He has entrusted to you to use for your benefit (or if you choose your demise) and your family's. I have lost a lot of money in the markets (options, stocks, Forex), probably money I may never recover. But it has taught me lessons...a tuition of sorts if you may. Tread the markets with caution, tend toward the conservative side, think outside the box, recognize an opportunity when it arises, and on and on. Just a little philosophy for the day...

Hi 1Trader2,  
i think in your experience that Firebird doesn't fail, simply your money management fail. You said that you start to risky more than reasonable adding more pairs so your risk trading was not tollerable and finally market blow out almost your account. This could be happen with any trading system not only with Firebird, so learn from your mistake and continue to improve your money management ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
After 2 month since i started this new thread about Firebird my result in demo and live account are good and i'm actually in the 5% of winners traders in the forex market ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
  
My demo account started on 1st Aug 2006 (online 24/7 every day!) reached about 3800 pips with Firebird v0.63g , 150 win trades , 2 loss trades for a winning percentage of 98.68%, and with these performance this system will be profitable even if it uses a really bad ratio risk:reward=10:1. If performance will go under certain percentage (le't say 95%) then i will stop to trade with Firebird.  
  
On other hand in my live account started 1st Sept i collected 'only' 660 pips with a more conservative modification of Firebird developed by me called Skypips (may be i will post it in another thread if you wish) with 32 winning trades and 1 loss trade for a win percentage of 96.96%  
Obviously i'm monitoring every day how EA is performing and i'm also looking and testing in demo account different EA (like Phoenix, Fozzy) just to be able to switch to another one if my EA will start to fail.   
Infact i know that at some point in future Firebird/Skypips may not be more profitable and when this will happen i have to be ready to find another EA that could be comfortable for me trying to avoid that may account will blow out in few days.

Skyline brings up a good point, Out of the traders running FB live, how many are working on a backup plan as well, or have other EAs 'testing' the markets to see what works. I feel it would be unwise to put all our pips in one basket. For me, I am demo-ing 'Flyer', 'Phoenix', and occasionally use 'Amazing' around news time. Too bad we can't code them all in to 1 'Master' EA ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Greetings, on a "backup plan" i have been forward demo testing 4 different families of EAs since early in my EA experimenting. I have said in the past how important i believe it is to have a manageable EA portfolio containing a handful of potentialy profitable EAs for the different moods of the market.  
  
The number one priority for myself is determining the mood to determin which EA(s) will be used and when.

Precisely Skyline...  
  
Adapt. Improvise. Dominate.   
  
No EA will work perfectly forever and ever _ad infinitum_. It requires monitoring and tweaking for continued optimum performance so as the market evolves so does the trader's strategy.

15 trades closed in profit for 150 pips; 1 loss for 100 pips. GBP/JPY was the one loss **(-$842.03)** as it trended unabated to SL 100. I will review the code because this issue was addressed such that losses should stop at 65 pips. Still FB generated **$626.75** in net profit.

MoneyMaster,  
  
I agree with you totally. Man brings about his own demise, pain, suffering, etc. It does not come from God. There is nothing wrong with being strong, but it has to be tempered with humility. Those who are truly strong do not need to boast for in boasting one shows one's weakness.

I, like Paul (aka Saul), boast in the Lord. For it's in Him the I live, that I move, that I have my being. Without Him I can do nothing and with Him all things are possible to me. _That's_ Word; that's the definition of humility. I'm submitted to His way, not mine.  
  
And to those who say God should be kept out of forex, as far as I know emblazoned on the "almighty" dollar we find the words **"In God We Trust"**... but everyone else pays cash!!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Reviewed the code.   
  
The condition under which FB liquidates a losing trade is an "and" not an "or" gate. I thought it was an "or" gate in this instance.  
  
In other words, if a trade has been open for "x" hours [like 36] _**AND**_ pips lost exceeds or equals the designated "liquidate-point-because-of-the-number-of-pips-lost", then FB liquidates the position. Both the "x" hours and "number of pips lost" are trader-provided. The idea is to cut your losses and prevent FB from continuing to the designated SL which at 300 for micros and 100 for standards can be a decent hit. In my tests, that's been the most significant and latest (and last?) obstacle to results without spot or blemish.

Don't stop now. Sounds like you are just getting warmed up.  
I am with you on this one for sure.

Sure. Most traders at FF are willing to help to some extent. That's what makes FF such a positive and informative place for traders of all levels.

My FBv2 test has brought in $1003 closed trades and opened up two trades during this session's trading that are now showing -$417, time will tell if those two are bad calls by FB as it appears on both CHF and EUR they are breaking out of former recent S/R.  
  
MM, thx for the clarification on the AND not OR thingy, was wondering that myself but hadn't looked in the code yet. One thing i'm wondering. I may or may not end up trading FB on Fridays, but lets say the two above trades that (for simplicity) were opened at GMT 00:00 on Thursday, does this mean that 72 (default) clock hours later, if one or both of these trades have exceeded the preset $$ they will close Monday?? (00:01 / 72:01hrs later). Basicaly the Q is are weekend hours included in the close function. . . OR are these "Market" hours??  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Can I ask a simple question, first are you using IBFX or another broker and what are your settings, are they those settings which were posted earlier?  
Any other hints? I just want to try to duplicate your resultsd and then try improving them.  
Blessings  
Berdj :-)

**Berdj,**  
  
**Thank you for reading the thread.** Short answer. Yes, those which were posted earlier.  
  
Please see wackena's post 1277 (includes the EA with settings) and nvwine's post at 1286, especially the end of the pdf attachment. Both posts include settings that should work for the most recent FB v.2 and the earlier version v.01a (or something like that).   
  
Op-ed:  
Too many traders keep asking for the settings which indicates they aren't reading the thread. This happens in all the threads with EA testing. My point is reading and studying the posts is extremely helpful and will increase your understanding as to the reason for the settings. In all your getting get understanding thereby avoiding the temptation to just say "gimme the _blankety-blank_ settings so I can make money."  
  
My personal settings are totally different because I'm testing for standard lots, which obviously means a larger account that will accommodate an increased margin and higher negative float.  
  
Finally, you just need an MT4 broker to execute the EAs....the one I use is irrevelant to the success of FireBird.

Thom,  
  
Wackena just produced this modification last Friday I think, and that issued didn't arise over last weekend. I believe several trades opened that Friday and closed on Monday with a profit.   
  
Not to pass the buck but Wackena can answer that question from a programming perspective better than I can. Seems to me "hours" means "clock" hours. Otherwise wouldn't he have to establish something called "market hours" within the program? I didn't see it. Without such a definition what would differentiate the two (clock hours vs market hours) from a programming perspective? Unless mql includes a predefined term for market hours.   
  
Short answer: Over my pay grade!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

bac0n, it's all a matter of perspective.  
  
When I reported results this morning, I was in profit. I play the front nine, have lunch, come back this afternoon and at 3:30 pm edt, FireBird's showing a loss of **$140.80**.   
  
**The Good News**  
It's all a matter of perspective because that includes two setbacks for  
_-$795.86 and -$281.49_. So despite approx $1,077.35 in negative trades, FB is only showing a net loss of $140.80. I would say FB weathered the trends quite well.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thom,  
Yes, weekend hours are included.  
  
The CloseLoosingTrades works on Server time. In your example above: I use IBFX and server time is GMT-4. Order opened Thursday 00:00 GMT = 20:00 my server time. CloseHour=72, LossLevel=100. if OrderProfit() is below $ -100, then, if PC is running, order should close Sunday after 20:00 server time.

When running FB, what would you consider an acceptable float? My current float went from about 12% to about 30% of my ballance today when a few of my pairs went trending. Which wasn't cool, but on the bright side, the open trades I was carring since 10/6 finally closed out. Oldest trade I have now is from 10/12, about 7 of those, then it jumps to 10/18 for a few, then the rest were opened today, about 16 of them ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) when the markets took off. I think FB still has a tendency to want to be a bad bird and follow trends if you don't watch it. It looks like it will be another week or two before it digs itself out of this one... Again!  
  
I may be missing a setting somewhere, but how can I stop FB from following the trend once it gets in it? Currently using v2.0 and v63H03.  
  
Thanks

hmm, many of your are afraid of Float. i was once like that, cant bare my eyes to see -1500pips floating, i wished i could do something to keep myself safe in the game.   
  
soon, i come to realise that, -1500 pips is not looking good but could be interesting once the trend reverse. That's the point of firebird. trading reversal! When there is profits, there's risk.  
  
Even the creator of these EA is working on the high float issue. Well, to me it's nothing bad as long as the trades holds on. It's not the deep floats that's killling u, it's yourself, your patiency towards your tradings.   
  
let me tell u how bad i gone through, i'm trading 0.02 lot, GBPUSD & USDJPY at 0.01 lot. Since last thursday it's not making pips. Float is around -$18, highest -$25, the 'exccessive loss alert' (i didnt change piploss setting) is killing me. You know how bad it is when someone keeps telling u every 2 second : 'u're losing, u're losing, u're losing....' I woke up every day at 8am wished to see some miracles (i go to bed at 3am)   
  
19th Oct where history are made, half of the open positions are closed all winning!, float is back to -$11, I'm so glad that i finally made it. Thank God! what a grateful day.

Have lived the last 24 years of my life by those words (and the rest of the Good Book). Though i fall short daily, somehow He keeps picking me up and setting me back on the righ path. For me God is in, and part of everything i do, work or play. A really great read is the a book written long ago by a Monk called [Practicing The Presence](http://www.practicegodspresence.com/). He lived his life washing dishes and doing chores in a monestary and was one of the happiest guys on God's earth!

Thanks Chad,  
  
You've brought into sharp relief two of the several major philosophical points of Firebird as set forth below:   
  
(1) For those of you trading micros on FB, -1,500 pips should be something you can patiently wait out for days like Chad successfully did; SL 300 is easy.  
  
But   
  
(2) For those of you interested in trading standard lots, -1,500 pips can approximate $15,000 (for just 1 lot, forgetting multiple currencies and forgetting about margin requirements for now). For some, that's a lotta cheddar, jack. So SL is reduced to perhaps 100 (or less), with the 36 hour plus 65-pips-down-cut-your-losses option (although that didn't help today because the trends moved 100 pips in less than 24 hours; gotta stop that unabated run to SL somehow).  
  
Both approaches are legitimate trading strategies, investments requiring not only your time and money but also your emotional energy.   
  
**Always understanding there's a degree of risk as my friend TraderOne pointed out, always accepting responsibility for the risk you incur for the hopefully commensurate, profit, the question simply boils down to: "How much (pressure, stress, nail-biting, stomach-churning, gut-wrenching, teeth-clenching, sleepless nights, worrying, grayhair,) for YOU is too much?"**  
  
Remember, when the pressure comes, it will squeeze out whatever's deep inside of you.  
  
Just information; not a recommendation.

well, ive been working on a modification of firebird along with the help of my master Satan. He inspires me to have more greed and look for as many pips as possible. One sure fact, when i go to the altar tonight to praise my lord of darkness i'll have some great tales to tell.

Can anyone reprogram FB v2 to take reverse (opposite) trades on all signals (if it shows buy signal, it would sell and etc). I have a theory I wanna test, but unfortunately failed to make the right changes.   
  
Thanks in advance.

That feature is easy to code, and the code was posted by myself and others in this thread (or maybe it was the original FB thread?). But the wins/losses % worked out to be nearly identical in forward and back testing as the market still varies from TradingRange to Trending... you are still left with the same situation in that FB works in only one mode and not both. All the reversed FB did was now allowed you to be marginaly profitable in a Trend.

Skyline,  
Wackena,  
accrete,  
  
maybe one can answer my following question because  
its program related.  
  
First of all I must say, that I know that this is an ongoing  
process and I know that certain comments within the source code weren't updated to the latest version.  
But I found something that seem at least so strange  
that I can't help asking if this was indeed intended to  
be like this.  
  
I refer to Firebird-v63H04-TS  
  
(1) The property "percent" is stated in the comments  
at the beginning of the source code as 2 per cent  
and is initialized later with 0.05 and I use in my  
settings 0.02  
  
I assume that the envelope SHOULD be 0.2 per cent  
above/under the MA(10) ?  
  
(2) Later in the source code the value of the envelope  
will be calculated with:  
  
myMA*(1+Percent/100)  
  
This would result in an extremly narrow envelope  
since the setting is again divided by 100 .  
  
My question: is this narrow channel intended ?  
  
  
Anyway, great work! Keep it up! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi folks.  
  
I am trying to understand how the Trailing Stop feature works on Firebird. I am running 63H04-TS version on a live account, and it is doing fine. I have a lot of trades that are stopped out by the TS, which I am ok with. However, I don't understand at what poing FB moves the S/L up and to what point.   
  
For example, if I have a T/P of 50 pips, and a T/S of 30, when does FB move the S/L up and to where? Does it move it to break even first? My settings have smaller TP and TS, generally around 25TP and 18TS. But my trades are closing out between 10 - 15pips in the positive. I was considering using multiple lots, but I want to fully understand what's going on before I do that.  
  
Thanks for your help.

let say your trailingstop set to 30,  
  
once your positions is +30 pips  
  
then, your stop loss will move to currentbid-5pips for buy order, and currentask+5 pips ' for sell order.  
  
in wackena's firebird trailingstop code, after stoploss moved once, it will not move any further even your position is +80pips, or +120pips.  
  
i wished there's someone who can code the latter part of trailingstop, like in the next +30 pips, stoploss will move again.

I'm not too sure about that Chad. The way the TS has worked for me is in this sence, say my TS is 10pips, upon hitting 10pips, the TS moves my SL to breakeven, then every other equal move, it will again adjust the SL pip by pip, which is why i can close out in some positions with anywhere from 1-49 pips, even though my TP is 50, because the TS moved my SL to that point.

okay i was mistaken about the move to break even, it does do the routine you mentioned of bid-5 and ask+5, sorry about that. but it does continue to adjust it every chance it gets, not just once. it just the standard TS routine from 63g-TS2, thats what i'm using. I can't post it as i'm not at my home computer. hopefully wackena can address your issue of it only moving once, because as far as i know it should do it any chance it gets, assuming the qualifiactions are met, which is how it works for me..

Does any one have a problem back testing FB v2 with timeframes (openinghour/closing hour). Everytime I try I get no results (my timeframes are at least 12 hours)

What i can state, without hauling out copies of my demo reports is that my testing over the last several weeks on non-jpy pairs do best from European open (1hr before London open) through about 11am New York (just before their lunch time, and Europe/London bankers are closing shop.) Most loosing trades for my demo tests have opened in the Asian session.  
  
I have my to-trade hours set accordingly.

Hey guys and gals,  
  
I went live Sunday on IBFX. I am using the Firebird 63G-TS  
  
How do you get rid of the "excessive loss" alert?  
I will post results throughout the weeks ahead.

oh,   
  
it's '63g-ts2' after all. So, have u fully understand the trailing stop function in this EA?  
  
if u got time, mind to post your TS rountine of 63-TS2 ? I like to compare the results from both of the versions.

there's a 'piploss' parameter in the EA, default is 500, change to 5000 or anything higher.

Hi there, i am running 3 MT4 IBFX demo (GMT on server) accounts as follows on 5m charts:  
  
FB 63H04 defaults time to trade 0/24 on UsdChf, UsdCad, EurUsd, EurChf  
  
FB 63H04-TS defaults time to trade 0/24 on UsdChf, UsdCad, EurUsd, EurChf  
  
FBv2 defaults (except close loosing trades set to false**) time to trade 6/16 on UsdChf, UsdCad, EurUsd, EurChf  
  
**A note on the FBv2 "close loosing trades" setting. I noticed (and asked the Q last week) that if there are loosing trades going into the weekend if the setting would include the non-trading-hours of the weekend in it's calculations. Yes it will. So last Friday, with three loosing trades at -60ish or greater average, i decided to turn this feature to false in my default setting as i wanted to give the trades at leaset a day or two in the new week to see if they would recover. They did so in today's (Monday) trading session. All three closed out in profit. The CAD had S/L kick in and closed at +11, E/U TP hit at +25, CHF TP hit at +25. This was a case when closing out the trades would have taken a big hit on the account. Though i realize the market could have also continued _against the EA's entries_. Just typing that last sentence out is an interesting thought. I used to blame everything on my Mamma wearing combat boots, or the sun in my eyes...grin.

Out of curiosity did you ever compare "real time" results with backtesting?

Thom  
  
Of course being the **outstanding tester** that I am, I let my losing trades continue and did not turn the feature to false but left it on. And since I did the opposite of you, I had the opposite result.   
  
My two huge losers continued from Friday into Monday. Of note is that both trades continued to the SL 100 point. For example, FB opened USD/CHF short at the price of 1.2568 on 10/20 at 03:31; closed at 1.2668 on 10/23 at 10:00 (-$789.39). I admit the failure to close may be due to my code; I cut and pasted wackena's code to close losing trades into the v63h[04]TS version of FB (obviously it didn't close within 36 hours over the weekend).

As i'm not one for placing much value in the backtesting i didn't bother with backtesting. This was one of those no brainer calls on my part when i saw the weekend coming up and didn't want the clock to keep ticking without the EA to have it's full time alotment to do it's magic. Though i can feel MM's pain on what took place in his demo account (i hope it was demo MM !!), i am glad that there was someone keeping track of similar trades that could report such findings. This shows us that a bit of Human Heart in the Mind of the Machine is a good thing !  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Good work glenn. I think daily monitoring is the way to go, particularly if you're trading full lots.

Glenn, would you mind sharing your settings and pairs for your live account.  
  
I'm afraid I've lost about 25% of my live account in the last 6 weeks. V1.0a.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

That's good to hear MM on the demo vs live. A funny note your ending comment triggered; a pastor buddy of mine once told me the enemy of the "Right" is "Good". I think you are saying the same thing : )

**More than $3,700 in losses due to the trends on Friday.**   
  
Between Friday and today, demo account reduced by -$2,996.37. Pretty much eliminates the gain from early last week. Hopefully things are returning to normal as float is only -$936.19.  
  
It's noteworthy that some of that loss was due to me deciding to change EAs, using the H[04]TS version where I attempted to code the "closelosingtrades" feature, with obviously none too great a success! But I will try again....  
  
So I'm returning to v2 with all the bells and whistles expertly programmed by wackena.

though i'm not using the time function for my losing trades i do keep tabs on them in respect to length in the market and -float. i was actually about a to close a few week+ old trades that had where way down, but luckily for me, like with accrete, they straightened themselves out sundaynight/monday morning due to that trending market in the wee hours. imagine that, trending actually helped firebird, haha.  
  
and this is just a reminder to everyone to keep an eye on thier trades this week with the FOMC interest rate statement Weds afternoon (though its forcast to stay the same), aswell as the GDP release on friday.  
  
i may actually just ride the market a little bit more, as i'm up on equity compared to last week, then get out before all the news. we'll see.  
  
take care fellow firebirders.

Mmmmmm......  
  
Maybe I'll try SL 300 on the standard lost test just to see if it will reverse and return to profit, although it doesn't seem like something I'd do "live".  
  
That's why it's called "testing".....just try it and see.

i don't think you need to go for the full 300 SL. You're at what 100 now? Myself I use a variation of SL between 125 - 200 depending on the pair. 300 is too much for me. Even it it is just testing, heh.

Hi MM, this happened to me the first week in September after a couple weeks of nearly doubling my demo account. Then, in one trending week, all the gains were taken out and the account went down over 50%...all in less than four trading days! My FBv2 is doing ok, up just over 16% from last week's open to today with -3% float. 63H04 and TS are at break even closed trades and ~ -3% float each for same period.

For myself, my enjoyment of EA testing continues. I trade manually as most do in the thread on a regular basis. Testing these various EAs has added to my trading knowledge greatly. And hey, my EA testing still produces on average about 22-25% net profits per month. Sounds "proper" to me.

I started running the ea on a live account after testing it on a demo. I started live on the 2nd October with $275.00 and it now showing a balance of $526.00...  
  
I find it works best with USD based pairs. and i only run three pair at this time......so it has less chance of running out of control...  
  
I hope this helps you...

Awesome results!!  
  
Let me add that FB did return to the winning way grabbing 68 pips, valued around +$540.00.  
  
Winners tweak....we tinker....we adapt....yes winners overcome. But we never giveup and we certainly never, ever quit. Surrender??? **NUTS!!!**

yes iam pleased with the results so far...I must add that i have been trading for around five years and also trade manualy as most people in here do.  
  
Thats maybe why i am taking the ea slowly few pairs and low lot sizes, from what Ive seen a lot of people look at forex as the big money spinner and try to make millions in there first few weeks...needless to say they all lose there money.  
  
they treat a ea the same..thinking that they can set it up and come back in a month and theres a million in there bank account.  
  
then when they see its not like that they blame the software or indicator..  
  
Education is the key as well as money management.  
  
If i can help anyone with the little I know please feel free to ask...

seems you may have found gbp/usd sweet spot, if its woring the best for you. most of us have given up on gbp/usd as it was the pair taking all the losses.  
  
i aswell do 3 pairs (it makes it easier for me to manage, because i like to keep an eye on it at all times, except during sleep, haha). my pairs are eur/usd, usd/chf, and usd/cad. out of those i'd have to say swissy is doing the best.

hello mate,  
  
your settings seems a bit odd, can you post your statement ? i like to look at the trades percentage. i'm running v63 live too, results are not as much as you are. maybe you've got a better settings than i have.

Hi Skyline,  
  
I saw your performance and it's very good. Could you please answer some questions? Do you use v0.63G or v06.3G fixed version? Which timeframes do you use and which settings, and which currency pairs?  
If I compile the v0.63G and also the fixed version, there are always around 5 warnings, what can I do. I think I have all fb on my pc, but not everyone works, which version do you use, and where can I find it?   
  
I am relative new in fb, but not in trading.  
  
Thanks for your help.  
  
Kind Regards, Erkro

Hi Erkro ,  
I'm using v0.63G **with** jpy fix , timeframe is set to M30 , settings are SL = 300 , TP = 30 , Pipstep = 30 , other settings leave as is .  
Pairs are : EURUSD, USDCHF (the best!), GBPUSD, USDJPY (the worst!), USDCAD, EURJPY, CADJPY.  
Don't worry about those warnings they are referred to some function declared and never used inside code so nothing to worry about ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hey All:  
I have to say, Firebird is a great EA to have in your portfolio for ranging markets. I just shut down and cashed out all open trades. I've been running live 24x7 since Oct 2nd. Overall, profitable.  
  
Just my opinion, but the swings seem to to be getting a little to wide. I was down over 27% in floating loss at one point. Mono's 30/300/30 kept me in the game (Thanks Man!).  
  
My own 2 cents:  
1) Pick currencies that are going to range  
2) Position your lots accordingly. 300 pip swings with ~10 open trades will put the squeeze on your confidence  
3) Interest will kill you if trades sit for too long. (Almost 40% of my profits went to pay the man)  
4) Shorter up/down cycles are where this baby shines.   
  
Used v63h02 on USDCAD, EURUSD, USDCHF 30/300/30  
Started v1.0c on the 12th for NZDUSD  
  
Anybody have any ideas how to use this baby long term? I'm afraid a long term trend is about to hit the $.

I agree with you. I got the experiences and plan to close manually all the Open Trades while my equity come up to a certain level, especially before NFP (first week in a month). Otherwise I need another month just to recover from the injury caused by the trending market.  
And the success key of FB (just like trading with whatever system is used) is BOOK THE PROFIT. So I am very concern about the equity.  
Happy trading to all.

Hi Skyline  
  
Just to make sure: You said you are using v0.63G _**without**_ jpy fix - do you then still get trades opened in the JPY pairs?  
  
Thanks!

Sorry I was wrong because there is a lot of jpy orders opened ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)   
I forgot that when I found jpy bug I did fix it directly on demo running v063G , so i'm using v063G with jpy fix ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hey everybody,  
as we all know it is best to avoid the pair gbpusd with Firebird.  
However, when backtesting FB, gbpusd is the best pair if you use 3500sl or no sl at all.  
Result of backtesting for the past 2 years: 2619 wins/0 loss! (ok, none hit sl, just got stopped out at the end of test.)  
10k account using mini turns into near 40k.  
So I have been testing it for a month now live with microlots.  
Results are 16 wins/0 loss and 1 floating -36 pips.  
There should be more trades, but I had problems with the EA shutting down after reconnecting to the server.  
I didn't pay much attention to it because it is only microlot and the good part of that is that I didn't interfere.  
So now I am considering opening a swapfree acount to let the trades run without having to worry about the swap.  
  
Happy trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

I want to say yes, but I think the original users manual said it could be used on others. I don't have the file handy, but I did grab it from one of the firebird threads here at FF.

Glenn5t,  
  
How did you get your firebird to work so well with the USD getting beat up bad these last two weeks. I see it went well, but mine got hammered, getting stuck in the trend several times. I also use an Interbank, live mini account. Any help would be grateful!!

I saw the settings, I'll give them a try next week. Do you change anything else. Like I said my FB got stuck in 3 trends USDCHF, EURUSD and USDCAD. So right now I have a big hole to crawl out of. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) But by looking at your statement, I should be able to do it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

With 1min data criss! That the best you can get with backtesting. MT4 can not be more accurate than this. Unless we can test it with tick data in the future. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

btw. this backtest was done with Alpari. Alpari uses 70k instead of 100k for whole lot. Mini would be 7k instead of 10k. That's the reason that 35pips tp is not 35$ but $24.50. So compare this backtest with others using 0.7mini lot. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
  
edit: got confused with other backtest of mine. Correction. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1):

Hey glenn5t,  
  
Correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like you were able to do well because of Pipstep = 40. Myself, I had Pipstep in the 10 - 12 range and opened way to many orders. I also had 6 pairs running.  
  
I saw your earlier post about being patient and not trying to become a millionaire overnight.  
  
Great advice, and you are living it.  
  
I appreciate your unselfish help on this thread.

well thankyou Piece Of The Pie.  
  
  
yes I think that maybe the answer...the smaller pairs and staying with the dollar pairs is the key I think, I also belive runninig it on the 5 min time frame...I have tried it on the 15mins and 30mins time frames and the results were poor.  
  
I did try one order with a non dollar pair as you can see in the statement and it ran for several days going about 120pips down and then came up and i closed it manualy..  
  
In all poor result..again i say the GBP/USD pair have returned the best with the USD/CHF second....therefore my plan at this stage is to stay with the four main pairs all dollar pairs and increase the lots size as the balance increase's...  
  
the next step will be $1.00 a lot and I want a balance of around $1200.00 before I will consider it.  
  
I share the information because i belive this Ea is a good one and the only way to improve it is to share experinces with the other traders.  
  
I really like the way it perform's during news time.

hi glenn,  
  
adjusting the lot size, dont u think it's a bit too risky ?  
  
but your float is extremely lower that usual. Have you experience margin call before ? i think i need to follow your pathway. Trading GBPUSD with firebird in such a success, unbelievable.  
  
Thanks.

yes i am familiar with margin calls...i have been trading for around five years..let me explain my plan is based on a mini account and i have taken into account the cost of a lot x 12 and a surplus for the positions to move.So far I have been well within the amount required.  
Remember Iam running only 3 pair.the most positions I have had opened at any one time was 10....and that happened once.  
  
remember I have changed my pipstep..therefore I have reduced the amount positions the ea will open.

I forgot to add you can run three pair with two at 0.25cents and one at 0.50 cents therefore again reducing your risk. this of course allows you to set the pair with the best returns at a higher rate.  
  
I have run Gbp like this for a week now.

glenn5t,  
  
I think there is a version of FB that has Max Open Orders built into it. i am not sure if you have seen that, but from the looks of your statement, I don't think you need it. I do have to say that right now I am concerned about running GBPUSD on my FB, only do to the fact that I am in a small hole as far as float is concerned. Which I am hoping that this comming week will fix ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) , but we will see. Since you say USDCHF work well on the 5M I am going to start there, with small lot sizes, untill my account gets built back up. I have to thank you for the help, I agree I think FB is a great EA, and with some refining it can be even better. I have been fiddeling with a money management routine that should help prevent blowing up an account, but that is a slow work for me. (Right now day job comes first).  
  
Thanks again  
Rusty

Dont believe your baktest results..............anything lower then 90% accuracy is complete garbage......I used to backtest and compare results with a live account and most of the time the results did not match

As I said before, the highest you can get is 25% with 1min data. You can compare that to the 90% of 5 min data.  
But you want 90%, so this one is for you.  
  
Anyway, it is still a backtest. I only trust my own actual tradings. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

Has it been just a bad weed for my FB or is everyone else having a bad time of all this $ bad news. I know NFP is Friday, so I figured FB would love the ranging, but I guess it isn't ranging enough. So how about a little update, how is everyone doing this week????

Hi Rusty. I'm losing my A#$ a little at a time.  
  
Trading only the EURUSD and USDCAD and going down, down, down, but slowly. It will take me several months to lose my whole account at this rate.

I had different demo accounts running with FB with different brokers and there is a difference..at least on the demo feed.  
  
I tested with FXDD IBFX and Multibank and although the majority of trades came out within 1-2 pips difference,the final results all varied.

yes i have a indicator setup loaded on three different MT4 platforms and while two are close the other is miles away..on the signals..and thats what made me think that maybe its the trouble here with the ea performing differently...

I am also running live on interbank FX, and was doing pretty well, untill the last two weeks. The last two weeks have really burned up my account badly.  
Glenn5t, I have been running your settings on USDCHF, & EURUSD, with no trades the last two days. Sorry, 1 trade signal USDCHF, around 10:23 GMT on Tuesday 10/31, trade didn't go through do to a margin issue with my account (none left) but that is fixed now, but still no signals.

I also notice that skyline and genn5t seem to be doing the best using different settings. I wonder if someone could explain why people using the same settings are getting different results. It would be great if some of the people who are having success could share their thoughts on why it is working for them.   
  
Thanks to all.......great thread!

**rusty105**  
{table deleted, please repost as 600 max wide}  
  
this is the results for the last two days....yes I only had one USD/CHF order as well.  
  
Again GBP/USD the best reults.  
  
  
**berdj**  
  
I run Firebird V63G-TS  
  
**traderlismiss**  
  
I belive it has to do with the steppip setting. I have mine on 40 as you see it makes a few trades therefore not putting my account at risk.  
  
the point of the pipstep is to open a new position every time the pair move from the last open position.therefore if you have it at 10 it will open a new position every time the pair move 10 pips away from the last position it opened.  
Therefore if the pair moved 50 pips you are going to have 4 trades.thats ok if your margin can take it.  
And if your running 6 pairs well you could have at less 24 new trades .  
  
Also I run my charts on 5 min TF.do not change the TF in the ea leave it at 15min.  
  
A very good friend of mine back tested them for me and we found that the 5min TF gave the best returns.  
  
And again I trade the GBP/USD...I know some of you dont but as you can see from the statement it returns the most.  
  
I hope I am able to help in some way..  
  
Glenn

Thanks for your reply glenn5t. So if I understand your setup correctly, you are running v63g-TS. You are running with 5min charts and 15min timeframe, 40 pip TP, 300 pip SL and you are using a 40 pipstep.   
  
Your results are great and it is nice of you to share. I am going to use the same setup to forward test and see what results I get.  
  
Thanks

Do server time and _extern int GMT = 2_ option have to do with people getting different results with the same settings (S/L, T/P and etc)?_ extern int GMT = 2_ is this an important option, does anyone know what it is for?

Don't let anyone keep you from posting here. We need everyone's comments and especially those who are doing well. _I have started using your settings today and have already had some success without getting in too many trades._

Unless it is an admin, or moderator, ignore them. Yes FB can eat your account, and yes this all experimental, and everyone using it knows that!! I have used it all October, and while it almost blew up, with the help of everyone here, we pulled up, and did not crash and burn. It was totally my fault, but I was playing with the settings, and if it wasn't for all the info I got here I would have been lost. many more traders have done far worse trading manually, untill they learned how this is all done, I am still learning. While FB is not perfect, we are all working at it. I am learning, and hopefully in the next few weeks I will have a better understanding of MQ4, so I can contribute back to the cause.  
  
Long Live Firebird !!

Do you know how the time reflects on data, and yours is set to 2, is it your server time?

I setup my demo account yesterday using v63g-TS. It has entered me into four trades so far. I used the same settings as Glenn5T. I am trying to setup my demo the same as I would a live account. I am curious about two things. First, the TP is set to 40 and on both trades that closed I made 13.00 each at .50 per pip. Both SL's were red. I would have thought it would have closed higher. The second thing is I have not be entered into more trades. This is good in a way but based on what I have seen, I felt there would be more. I am trading three pairs, Eur/usd, gpb/uds, and usd/chf. It would be great to get some input.

Your trailing stop probably closed the trades on a retracement before the TP of 40 was hit.

Whats your trailing stop set at...reduce it if you want to take more profit but be carefull you dont reduce the trading room for the pair to much...  
  
  
take into account that the trading range for the GBP/USD for the last 32 hours has been 1.9055/1.9105.... ie 50pips if the ea is set at pip step![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) 40 then your not going to get to many trades.

I have just reread your post and I see you say the SL was red that means the trailing stop was activated...it should say what the trailing stop set ie the no in red.  
  
  
hope this helps.

I guess I don't quite understand how the trailing stop works in this ea. Does it activate after hitting a certain level? I have my TS set to 30 and my TP at 40.   
  
I do get why I am not in more trades with little movement and a 40 pipstep.  
  
Thanks for all your help.

Great results Wizard. Are you running Mono's varible settings or the standard 30-300-30, or something completely different?  
  
  
  
Great job and thanks for posting your sheet.

First day results for FireBird live, v.2. $53.00 profit.  
  
Trading mini-account, see attached for currency pairs. Yeah I punked out on trading standard lots but that will change to a standard account because I don't know how to count in mini-terms!!

**sm31**  
****  
Where it says pipstep= 35.........change the number if its below 35..  
  
40 for a slow gain and 35 appears to be opening a lot.

**Please see wackena's post #1277 in this thread**. It includes the EA and the settings for using mini-lots.  
  
If you read this thread, you'll see I've been testing and reporting results for "demo" accounts trading standard lots (100,000). On Tuesday Nov 7th, I switched from the "live" mini-account to the "live" standard account. So unless you're trading standard lots also, you don't want my settings. Use the settings in post #1277.

I let FB open two trades during the elections this evening....$58.00 in profit thus far, in less than two hours (0 float). Only two trades due to the unpredictablility of market impact from the elections. Think I'll shut her down now and await the election outcome.

There are several settings that are being used that are doing well. If you read back through this thread they are listed. You could look at posts by skyline, glenn5t, mono. This will give you an idea of what to demo. I am using glenn5t and skyline's settings on two different demos.  
  
Hope this helps.

Firebird is tough!!!  
  
Most of this morning I'd been looking at -$1,600 in float, using $5,000 in margin (trading "live", not "demo", standard, not mini lots), as the dollar strengthened due primarily to the election results. Now the float is approximately -$700 and, this is what I enjoy, trades turning to profit!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

FireBird is Tough! Part II  
  
See attached report for morning results....  
  
This is the first and quite probably the last time I'll post actual results. My word is bond so just take my written word for it in the future!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)   
  
By the way __the negative number (-$212) was not caused by FireBird__ but rather it's the result of a newstrade, something in Canada I think this morning.  
  
Correction: float fell below $300 during the time I was creating this message.

dswk,  
  
Page 92, post 1378 of this thread, has the settings, no need to post the same settings over and over again ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
On a great note! those settings are working pretty well, 8 trades closed today for profit. I'll post results for this week later today.

This weeks results.  
  
Some trades were manual. I think all the losses were from manual trades. The bulk of the float are 3 old trades from October.

I agree ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) Hopefully I can learn as FB grows my account, and maybe I can teach FB a few new tricks!

I am running live FB v2, which is doing ok...........  
Here is my dilemma, (please see attached file) i had a sell order open for eur/usd at 15:15 11/09 GMT at 1.2805, T/P was established at 1.2790.  
Well please have a look at the file, because it shows my T/P price reached, but order never closed. Has anyone seen this before, please let me know?

That's because the exit price is the ask (bid+spread) price not the bid. if you have a 2 pip spread then the exit price will actually be 1.2788 (bid) which is 1.2790 ask. The chart is showing the bid price or depending on the broker it could show the average of the 2. So it needs to go 2 pips lower to close the trade.  
  
Hope that makes sense.

All you fine people here in the firebird thread. Thanks for all of your input into making this EA. i appologise that I have not been more involved. Unfortunately i do not understand the programming side of things so cannot at this stage be very helpful.  
  
I am currently testing firebird 2 and pheonix. Both are doing very well.

as always, doing very well in ranging markets but can be killed in trends. Must avoid over-leveraging.

Hey all,  
  
Summary of Firebird 63g-TS. Placed on 5 minute charts.  
  
Live account on IBFX....Running 24/7 since 10/20.  
  
Depending on the pair, currently my settings are based on Mono's recommendations.... Take Profit is 16-25. Stop Loss is 160-250 (which hurt me while the USD pairs were trending more than 200 pips over the past couple weeks). My pipstep was increased to 40 last week after opening too many trades during the trend.  
  
AUD/USD 7 wins / 3 losses  
**EUR/JPY 6 wins / 0 losses (Not Bad)**  
**EUR/USD 2 wins / 6 losses (OUCH)**  
GPB/USD 9 wins / 5 losses  
**USD/CAD 23 wins / 0 losses (LOOK AT THAT)**  
USD/CHF 7 wins / 5 losses  
USD/JPY 11 wins / 3 losses  
  
14 trades in float right now.  
  
I am going to change to glenn5t's (and others) recommended 30 TP and 300 SL.  
By keeping the Pipstep to 40, I will open fewer trades and I think I can ride out long trends and not hit my stop losses. Over time, I believe most will come back to profit.  
  
Any other suggestions????  
  
Thanks to all for your help.

**FireBird v.2 Results for the Week**  
  
Trading live on 5 minute charts, with standard lots, 13 winners no losers, currently no negative float (all trades closed for weekend), 136 pips profit. This was a conservative trading week in that:  
  
(1) I disabled pipstep-driven increases and allowed trading one lot per currency pair at any given time;  
  
(2) I traded for only three days and five currency pairs (pls see my earlier post and report); and  
  
(3) Some trades were manually closed.  
  
**_My settings for standard lots are_ :**  
  
extern int MA_length = 10;  
extern int MA_timeframe = 15;   
extern int MAtype = 0;   
extern double Percent = 0.05;  
extern int TradeOnFriday = 1;   
extern int slip = 100;   
extern bool UseMM = 0;   
extern double Risk = 5;   
extern double Lots = 1.0;   
extern int TakeProfit = 20;  
extern int Stoploss = 150;   
extern double TrailingStop = 10;  
extern int MaxOpenOrders = 1;  
extern double MinMarginLevel = 250;   
extern bool CloseLoosingTrades = true;  
extern int CloseHour = 36;   
extern int LossLevel = 80;   
  
**WARNING:**  
  
Please note that based on these settings for standard lots, the worse case scenario is a **$1,500 adverse move** should any one currency pair move against your position by 150 pips within less than 36 hours!!!! That didn't happen to me this week but you should know the potential exists.   
  
I did see some pretty large negative floats. For example, cable alone at one time was -$300 plus, while total float was -$1,800 and more. I got on an airplane, left the trades open and eventually each negative position reversed to profit.  
  
**_Point is, if you don't have the stomach, personality trait and capital for this type of trading, my advice is that you stick with micro and mini accounts._**

**MoneyMa$ter**  
****  
I see your trailing stop is set at 10 pips. how do you find that?  
  
I am thinking that it would take you out at every little retrament and stop you from reaching your 20 TP....  
  
Also dont you find that with a trailing stop that short that when it takes you out your profit less pip spread would reduce your profits to only a few pips???  
  
I would have thought a better range would be more like 30 to 40 TP and a trailing stop of at the min 15.  
  
your risk reward would be high to with a take profit of 20 pips and a stop loss of 150 pips...  
  
Just a thought..

well another week has come and gone.....  
  
I started the week by changing the pipstep to 35. I did this to see if it would increase the return without risking the account to much.  
  
In all it was very successfull..  
  
last night we saw in the London session the sell off the dollar. this of course put pressure on the float. So I disabled Fire Bird for the rest of the night, counting on the NY session to bring strength back to the dollar..  
  
I will now wait till monday/tuesday trading to see if the market will return to the pervious range or if the GBPUSD has moved to its next range...  
  
I will then abled Fire Bird again when this is established...I think the GBP will move to a trending range for a while if so then the fire bird will be off untill this move ends...  
  
results for the week: balance $999.18......Float-$364.08  
  
have a good weekend..God Bless

Glenn,  
  
I have been testing FB for about 8 months. Went through a period in August and pretty much blew out a real account. I have been experimenting with different methods of money management, closing trades manually earlier, etc. I've tried being more conservative entering trades also. I've decided to revisit my thinking somewhat and let the EA do most of the work. I believe that the key is money management. My most recent experiment started at the beginning of this week. I took my trades from the past 8 months and analyzed them. The data pretty much agreed with Trader 7 statement in the beginning of the EA: **50% of the trades last a day. 45% 2-6 days 5% longer or just fail.** So the way I figured it was to close all trades that have gone longer than 120 hours. My data shows that the majority of those that go to the SL of 200-300 pips are those that go longer than 5 days. I am using FB 63HO4_TS_MM. I have a close trades feature in it that closes the trades after x hours. I believe that this was added to version 2.0. I just pasted it into this version as I believe it (63H04) is the most profitable version. My object is to open a fair amount of trades using the Major 4. I have set the envelope % to 0.05, pipstep to 30 and TP & SL to settings in version 1.0c as set up by Mono. It is posted in the first post of this thread. My theory is that if FB runs into a trend that the losing trades will exit earlier before hitting their full SL, and that the float will be lower because the trades open will only be 5 days old. We will see. I will post my results over the next couple months.

Glenn,  
  
Thanks for taking the time to give some thought to my setup. Let me say I agree with you....I'm just taking a conservative approach as described below.  
  
TS 10 can take me out at every little retracement and sometimes it prevents moving to the full TP, but it also produces a profit (albeit small at 7-8 pips). _I believe pigs get fat...hogs get slaughtered._ My little piggy approach is conservative and though the trade closes, it closes at a **profit**. FireBird can open another trade for that pair at the appropriate time.   
  
During demo testing I had set TP at 18 (_not_ a Fib number). Why? Because I noticed currencies seemed to often move to 18 pips profit, then reversed considerably to the down side creating a terribly high negative float. That's cool for demo testing and mini accounts but remember I'm trading standard lots live. So it made sense to me to take the smaller profit, close the trade and live to fight another day with a new trade. If anything, I may revert to TP 18.  
  
As to the SL 150, that was increased from 55 I think it was, because 55 was too close, came too quick and didn't allow room to breathe. That's getting stopped out at $550. I'm definitely not going to SL 300 for standard lots! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
Also, if a trade is losing 80 or more pips for 36 hours, FireBird will liquidate the position. I don't know if anyone else tested or traded standard lots so I was seeking a number acceptable to me and for now its SL 150. Could reduce it to the 100-125 range. Mathematically, there's a SL for standard lots that's the equivalent of SL300 successfully used for mini/micro trading and it seems to be in the 85-150 range. But it's really not a factor, unless the market enters a trend in which case I would manually halt trading.   
  
The risk/reward ratio bothers me not. I don't know how to spell "risk averse"! I'm either: (a) taking profit at 20 or (b) the trailing stop kicks in for the smaller profit. So I'm in and out at profit, maybe not for 50 pips but it's steady and consistent. This week I made 136 pips trading basically something less than three days? Doesn't pay for AvGas or JP-3 but I can live with those 136 pips. **Remember...pigs get fat...hogs get slaughtered!** I will continue tweaking the setup. Further, when I'm more comfortable, I can then increase the program to multiple lots with its higher margin requirements, higher negative float and most importantly the corresponding profit increase!

Hi MoneyMa$ter,  
  
Like your trading style by not being greedy.  
  
I want to try FB 2 on a demo account to trade on $400 play money. The demo account is $500, but want to tweak the settings were $400 is the capital  
  
I am currently using FB 1.0a in a real account on three pairs with limited results.  
  
What would be the ideal currency pairs and settings for $400.00?  
  
thanks.

Because I noticed currencies seemed to often move to 18 pips profit, then reversed considerably to the down side creating a terribly high negative float. That's cool for demo testing and mini accounts but remember I'm trading standard lots live. So it made sense to me to take the smaller profit, close the trade and live to fight another day with a new trade. If anything, I may revert to TP 18.

I don't know that there's any such thing as "the ideal currency pairs". ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) See my post #1198 on page 80 for currency pairs I was demo trading at that time. You can also review my trading report attached to my post #1476 on page 99.  
  
In this thread several traders (including glenn5t's post#1378 on page 98, wackena's post #1277 on page 86), have posted settings for accounts in the vicinity of $400. I opened my FB account as a mini but because my experience is in standard lots, I quickly opened a standard account. Margin requirements are $1,000 per lot on my accounts, so I'm probably not the guy to answer your question. Read ths thread and you'll find several examples of settings posted by traders similarly situated to your trading style.

Wakena, skyline, MM, I'd like your opinions before I go ahead and program a TRAILING ENTRY into 63G TS. The idea is that birdy would set its original place for entry, start a trailing count from there, if price continues rising, it doesnt place an order, it doesnt place the order until price has stopped rising and retraced, a buffer of 5-8pips should work sufficiently from what i have seen so far. I hope I have gotten the idea across, the other good thing is that with divergence protection on, if price continued on its way up, divergence would stop a potential order in a trend onset.  
  
1, Would this be a good idea in general?  
2, What version of birdy would be suitable as a base?  
3, Would you agree with the 5-8pip buffer?  
  
Regards,  
Sean.  
  
Lets give this birdy wingspan.

Hi MoneyMa$ter,  
  
I looked through the FB resource page and found no reference page to FB2. Looking for the FB2 reference notes, but to no avail.  
  
My question is, what is the difference/philosophy of FB2 over all the other versions? If you can link a page, that would be great. Also, I have seen no indications of currency pairs that FB2 does not like.   
  
BTW: Are you looking at Phoenix?  
  
Thanks.

Anybody know why FB doesn't average the opening price for a new Take Profit level, like it says it should in the manual. There is code in place for this to happen, but it seems it has either been commented out or the function isn't called???

The function is called, but does nothing for the TP because FB passes the "false" to the function as  
ChangeOpenOrders(false, myTotal, AveragePrice);  
  
As a result, it does not modify the TP. I have done a test to pass the "true", all positions can be modified for their TP to the same level. Good or not? When the TP is hit, all positions will be closed. Mostly, it needs to wait long time, sometimes, it just misses some good chance.   
  
Thanks!

All the more reason to read this thread so you can gain an independent understanding as to how FireBird works, in all its versions.  
  
Look again becasue Accrete has done an excellent job in summarizing each version, and clearly v.2 is discussed:  
[http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...a-archives.htm](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives.htm)  
  
Also wackena explained how v.2 works in his post that I provided you and the link he provided you. When you compare that with the detailed evolution of FireBird set forth in this thread, the original thread and Accrete's summary, you will have all there is to know about the philosophical and operational differences of each version. An investment of time and effort is required on your part.  
  
No, I haven't considered phoenix. If I did, I would read the entire thread in order to gain personal understanding for conversational and operational purposes, then demo test it, tweak if necessary, then go live if I thought it had merit, based on my research.

**FireBird begins its second week "live" on standard lots**.  
  
As of this writing three winning trades closed for 35 pips profit, no losses, beginning with the Sunday opening. Going back to last week, that's 16 consecutive wins for 171 pips.   
  
Of course a good newstrader can get 170 pips in one day trading something like the NFP, while cable traders can derive 120+ pips in a 24 hour period on cable's daily price movment, and techies can get hundreds of pips, albeit in typically a longer time frame. These various strategies, alone or in concert, provide the serious trader a formidable arsenal of trading tools.

Here is the EA programmed with features as described + my present settings (TP, TS, SL, as per Ver 2c...Mono's settings from 1st post + statement from first 5 days. Also see previous post.   
  
Also EA needs to run longer to see how it handles the closing of trades after 5 days (120 hours) and how it does in trends.

Thanks for the kudos MM. And here is an open invitation to anyone realizing that i need to include other FB links/items at the page. I would greatly appreciate a PM or email if something needs to be tweaked. It is difficult for me to keep up on some of the changes and i've gifted space to other trading models found here at the factory so your eyes and ears are appreciated !  
  
Cheers,  
Thom

Hi Skyline: (that's the name of the high school my son goes to here in Sammamish, WA)  
  
Thanks for sharing your results. What settings, pairs and timeframes were used to derive these results? This was based on forward testing on a demo account, correct? Have you tried backtesting over the same forward-tested period to see if FB backtests properly? Lastly, do you know what your max negative float has been?  
  
I've been looking through the thread to find what settings you use but I haven't found it yet. Would sure appreciate knowing that important bit of information.  
  
Thanks!

Thanks for the recap. And, to be clear, exactly which pairs are traded in this setup? I saw mention of cable and swissy, but, just want to make sure I understand exactly which pairs are recommended with this setup.  
  
Thanks!

Looking through the thread I've found post #1399 from glenn5t with a statement showing just the 4 majors. So, looks like that's the answer.

Nevermind. Found skyline's settings mentioned in post #1385.  
  
Bill  
  
P.S. I find it helpful in these threads to always include settings (including timeframes, pairs, broker used, live/demo, etc.) whenever posting results. That way all relevant info is contained in a single meaningful post.

1Trader2 - many thanks. I'll start forward testing it today.  
  
Here's my last 3 weeks since starting vb2 (hedge) live with IBFX mini. I've moving to a massive stoploss and lower lot size, along with pipstep 35 to protect from becoming massively one-sided during trends. At least when the trend develops the hedge version makes money on the way!  
  
Also M5.

Hi Glenn:  
  
Thanks for sharing. I've been reading through the thread trying to assimilate what is the ideal setup. And, you've provided some very informative posts. However, forgive me, but, I'm seeing lots of changes with respect to your recommended setup. For example, you had posted a statement and indicated that you trade the 4 majors, then mentioned USD is going well and you just trade 3 USD-based pairs, then mentioned USDCHF is going well and now I see swissy is no longer recommended.  
  
I'm beginning to worry that the ideal setup is such a moving target that at any moment one could claim its working great or its not working at all.  
  
I'm not looking for any handouts, just want to learn from the collective experience so that I can get a positive start. Then, I'll be in a much better position to adapt settings and contribute toward a greater collective understanding.  
  
So, my real question is, on what basis do you add/drop pairs? How often do you go about changing your setup? Do you perform backtests to derive at conclusions to change the setup, or, are decisions based just on forward-testing?  
  
Thanks much for sharing. And, pardon if it looks like I'm singleing you out. Well, actually I have been because my first goal is to emulate the nice success you've been attaining!  
  
Cheers  
  
Bill

Excellent. Thanks Melissa. To be clear, you're using Glenn's settings as posted in forum post #1378 on M5 timeframe but with the following pairs (taken from your statement): GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, EURUSD, AUDUSD, USDJPY.  
  
Is this correct?  
  
Do you know what the max negative float has been so far while running all 6 pairs?  
  
Thanks a bunch!

In the statements I see NZDUSD, USDCHF, GBPUSD, USDCAD used. Are those 4 the only ones used to generate the results you posted? And, I see your note about running on M5.  
  
Thanks

pig,  
  
FireBird produces those signals when it trades; that is not a separate indicator. Below the main trading window, you see a MACD indicator.  
  
Try adding the indicator attached below which provides the band FireBird uses for trading. This is an indicator not an expert, so save appropriately.

**billworld**  
****  
my setting are based on a slow growth, thats why my pipstep is set in the range 35-40.....  
  
yes my settings and pairs have been changing, I run several pairs on a demo account at the same time with the same settings as my live account therefore i am able to review at the end of a week/month the returns per pair.  
  
based on that information I change the pair mix the next week on my live account. however at the moment I belive I have the ideal three pairs and I have no intention of changing them.  
  
I only run three pair because of the possible negative float ( mine has been max at $657.00).  
  
In the early stages back testing was done mainly with the view to find ideal time frames.  
I prefer to forward test and run it on a demo has I believe backtesting will only tell you so much...and you cant beat live/demo trading.  
  
Because I now feel very comfortable with my setup any changes from now on will only be minor...fine tuning....to gain maximum returns per pair.

TF M5, TP25, SL300, PS35, MA15, percent 0.1.  
USDCHF, GBPUSD, USDCAD  
  
the NZDUSD trade was a one-off.  
  
cable is raking in the most profit by far at the moment.

Just my 2 cents. I have 2 firebird demo accounts and both are doing very well. I posted the results from one earlier today and we'll say that is my 1st account. My second account has been running for a few more days and has Skyline's settings of 30-300-30. This account while generating a bit more profit has a much higher float. With glenn5t's settings I have about a 10% of profit float, while the skyline settings have about a 30% of profit float. Bottom line is, neither account has had a single loss. Both accounts have a good profit. So i guess my point is, if you are not worried about the margin you could use skyline's settings and have just a bit more profit. If however like most of us you are concerned about the float, I suggest glenn5t's settings. With the small float that I have in account 1, I am thinking about trading an additional pair. Not endorcing anything, just my 2 cents.  
  
  
Thanks

Hi traderlismiss,  
i'm happy that you are enjoying 'my' settings (that are original Momo's settings) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
Anyway I didn't have a float loss so high with those settings 30-300-30, my Firebird float loss is about 1400$ (14% account) using M30, may be are you using a lower timeframe or a lot of pairs ??   
I only can say that using Firebird based EA that is a counter-trend system isn't so simple , we have to be trained because we have for long time those negative float number that hurts our eyes, hour after hour. But as far as I can see this system seems robust and affidable in the long run and I'd like to leave my Firebird demo running for at last a year to see how powerful could be in (almost) every market conditions.  
Only time will say if Firebird is THE EA ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

First, I took your advice and added the Aud/usd and that has worked out very well. I am also running usd/chf, gpd/usd and usd/jpy. I eliminated the eur/usd because it was accounting for a large number of negative floats. I have been running just three pairs for most of this month.  
  
Thanks

Hi Skyline and good to see you back in the thread. As I said in my post, your settings are yielding more profit but my float has been around 30% of profit , not 30% of the account. That is probably acceptable but I do think a little higher pipstep is better suited for me. I hope you will get back into improving this firebird ea, since you started the thread and worked very hard on the ea we all now enjoy. I know you have been working some on Orangeroshan's method and it looks quite promising but I do hope you come back and stick around here some more.  
Thanks

Thats intresting my Eur has been running ok..no losses....I have run the CHF and UJ...  
  
  
Chf was slow and because it ranges wide can run a big float...  
  
I have tried several JPY pairs both eur and usd cross rate with the JPY and i have found them all to be hopeless...even running the new V2 i have the pair GBP/JPY and again its out with the highest negative amount.  
  
I dont belive Fire Bird can run with any JPY pairs....  
  
Its now 6 weeks and two days running live all USD pairs and no losses thats 100% profit...averaging 460 pips a week.

I am going to take your advice again. I had just added the usd/jpy and it had only opened one trade. I had been running the Phoenix EA and got use to trading some yen pairs. Thanks again for the help.

I have now fine tuned my pairs to the following GBP/USD and AUS/USD the two main ones with the best returns they are loaded with the higest lot size. and to make up the three EUR/USD.  
  
I have tried many in demos and these three are the best for returns..I will not change from these three and my settings I now have appear to be working well so they will not be changed the only change from now on will be lot size as the account grows.  
  
so my final settings are TP 50..TS 15...and pipstep 37.  
  
  
good trading and God Bless

Interesting.   
  
What works for mini-accounts is the opposite of what works for standard accounts. Obviously the settings must change (SL 300...no way) but also trading FireBird with standard lots works consistently well **without** the majors. Cable and Euro demo-tested okay and then only intermittently so I excluded both from the currency mix. Loonie is just that: loonie. It will be eliminated from the mix as it's currently floating around -$600.00; it will probably return to profit by Thursday evening but it's an eyesore. Usd/jpy....forget about it. If anyone has a different FireBird experience trading standard lots with the majors [live], I'd like to hear about it.  
  
Aud/Usd works very well and seems to be the exception that proves the rule of good performance for those currencies not matched with USD.

Very intresting...well if it keeps going the way it is I will be trading on a standard account..So I guess i will find out...  
  
I have run the Fire Bird on my settings on a demo standard account and it worked the same but demo is demo and live is live...lol  
  
I have taken a copy of your settings for a standard account and well be looking very hard at them when the time comes for me to change....  
  
If you change them would you send me a copy of the changes..

Hi Daniel ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  

  
Just a couple of things, give your self about 2-3 hours or so and read this thread, and this one, [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=5012](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showthread.php?t=5012) from page one to the current post. There is SO much info, that no one could put it into one post. I am not saying this to be mean, but to help you. FB won't make you rich overnight, but it can make you poor really quick, so 2 hours or so is a small price to pay, and it will answer most of your questions you have, and many you didn't think you had. It has helped me more then i can explain. You will learn what works, and what doesn't, and why. In the 2 threads there is the original PDF document that explains how it works, or should work. You will find probably no less then 6 different versions of FB each suited to a different way of thinking, a few web pages with more resources, maybe 50 or so reports from different users showing the results they have had with FB, etc... There really is no other way to learn how to use this Script. If you want to start out on a demo, which you really should, you can find the version I am using on page 95 of this thread, using the settings from Glenn5t. His settings can be found around page 92 of this thread, I think. Good luck, we are all here to help ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Looks like Mellisa's much higher negative float using Skyline/Mono's settings is a result of running on M5? So, running M30 as Skyline does will yield greater profit with less neg. float?

> Hi Skyline and good to see you back in the thread. As I said in my post, your settings are yielding more profit but my float has been around 30% of profit , not 30% of the account. That is probably acceptable but I do think a little higher pipstep is better suited for me. I hope you will get back into improving this firebird ea, since you started the thread and worked very hard on the ea we all now enjoy. I know you have been working some on Orangeroshan's method and it looks quite promising but I do hope you come back and stick around here some more.

Mellisa, Glenn, cgldsmth...  
  
Thanks for responding with details on the settings/pairs/timeframes you're using to generate the results you're posting. Glenn, thanks in particular for your insight on how you've been going about changing/updating settings. Making wise decisions there comes from much experience and a keen understanding of how all of this works. I think this is the one area we testers and "live runners" of this EA can really help one another.  
  
And, Money Master, I'm sure there will be more standard lot folks jumping on the bandwagon soon to compare notes with you. Thanks for your contributions.  
  
And of course, skyline, thanks for chiming in and all of your contributions.  
  
And, I'd like to thank my mother and my father... (oops, haven't gotten the Oscar, at least not yet...) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I'll begin testing soon likely with some combination of these settings and will report back after having accumlated enough meaningful data.  
  
Cheers  
  
Bill (hot on Firebird)

Skyline, I'd like to get just a bit of clarification.  
  
You say you are using the M30, but do you mean that is the setting in the EA, or the actual timeframe of the chart you are running? I thought that Mono ran on M1 charts with M30in the code. Thanks for any help here.

I just want to take a moment and thank everyone posting in this thread. You all in one way or another have helped me fine tune my Firebird EA. I am grateful to Skyline for starting this thread and writing much if not all of the code on the EA I am now using. I want to thank glenn5t for giving me some great settings that are really working. There are great people here, some are teaching and all of us are learning. It is great to see MoneyMa$ter and others doing very well and freely sharing their results. Let's all keep it up and make Firebird the best EA out there.  
  
Thanks

Yup all the time. I spend aprox 6 hours each day studying, and that includes some quality time here at the factory. My wife is still pleasantly suprised to see her electronic wiz kid of a husband open EVERY manual and read it from start to finish before even plugging the gizmo in or turning it on. I do the same with research, I read everything presented, then ask if there are Q's. Always been that way. I just love to learn. The balance of all that is of course to not be so crazed about learning that you don't apply what you've learned. It is sort of like the people who ask me if they should by XYZ Gizmo or wait until XYZv2 comes out! At some point in time one must take the plunge and live with the decision. And realize that even in this choice you will learn something !!! It's one of those more fun cycles in life i so enjoy. Always something new to learn each day!

My bad ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) I am not sure there is a 'Best one' , I am currently using v63G-TS using glenn5t's settings, which are working well, Thanks glenn5t ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Is it the 'Best'? I don't know, but it is working. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of v2, but it does work. I am at my 'day job' so I don't have the file handy, but go back about a page in this thread where I told someone else exactly where to get the file, and settings, if you want to use them. I am using them on a mini account. GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD are the pairs, some odd AUD and NZD as well for testing. I do suggest demoing in parallel with a live account, that way you can try other pairs to see what is performing best as of today.   
I apologize if it sounded like I snapped

Earlier in this thread there was someone keeping track of all the versions and settings. I am not sure who it was, but I remember it was early into the thread. I agree with MoneyMa$ter that it is easier and better for an individual to read through. Lots of good reading from the beginning.

Hi Traderone ,   
I'm using Firebird v063g on M30 charts with M30 in code this leads as far as I can see to a lower float loss because less orders are opened ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Skyline, I am sorry but I have been mistaken about your settings. I was right on everything except I thought you were using 1min charts instead of 30. Sorry about that mistake and it explains the difference in the float. I am going reset my settings in my one demo to match.  
  
Thanks

Sorry Bill but I just noticed your question as I was reading backwards through the threads. I never ran 6 pairs at one time. I was tweaking my EA and only ran three pairs at a time and there may have been an overlap of the 4th at some point. Like glenn5t, I am running aud/usd, gpb/usd and eur/usd now. I think either using glenn5t or skyline's settings you will be fine. I think my maximum float has been at it's high around $60.00. This on 50 cent lots

Here is a report of what I thought were Skyline's settings. This is using a 1min chart however and he uses 30m. The float is high but it is still a good account and I have since changed to match what he is actually using and test that. I only ran 4 pairs on this account at any one time but changed a few of them. William is the name on the demo account but it is me. I hope this helps someone.

I think the GBP/USD is giving the best returns mainly because it opens more trades. You agree? I am really pleased with the AUD/USD. It seems to go the right way everytime......so far.  
  
You had asked about Phoenix before and I had forgot to reply. I thought Phoenix was the greatest thing ever when I first opened a demo. Big profits right away and not much float. But Phoenix does not play well (in my opinion) with a fast market and I lost my entire two week profit in just a few hours. The guy leading the big contest is using a modified version and he his kicking tail. He posted his actual contest EA and some people are having great success, not me. I will stick with Firebird for now.  
Thanks.....  
  
I already had 3 accounts with these guy and had to use some other names.

Excellent Skyline. Thanks for your reply. That was my original reason for dropping back to the m5 from the m1.

I see folks are running the GBPUSD and AUDUSD.  
I must admit I'm scared *&$#less of the GBPUSD. If you will study the daily charts for the past year you will notice that a couple of times annually the GBPUSD goes on a direct march for about 1000 pips or more in one direction, usually over about 4 weeks.  
  
I think that would pretty well wipe out many of our accounts!  
  
I have had good success with the the USDCAD on v63G_TS with only a trailing stop of 10. I think at this point I'd rather trade that one than GBPUSD.  
  
Also, I've been thinking a lot about MoneyMa$ter's use of 150 Stop Loss.  
  
I like it. If Firebird's reversal trades don't come back in 150 pips, then I say cut our losses and make more good trades. No reason to let it drag out to 300 slowly over time. That's expensive agony. But that's just me......![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

I'm not a very active poster here, but I have experimented with FB for quite a while now. Doing that I also analyzed the code in detail to understand its function. From there I can say that changing timeframes from 1M unto 30M does only change one thing: Initially done for backtesting, FB supresses new orders for the time of 2 bars after a trade has happend (open or close). This means that FB's running pure without TS should see smaller differences, if TS is used then differences could be substantial. Imagine a situation where price is above the channel and a order gets closed by TS, then with 1M a next trade could be opened after 2 minutes, with 30M only after 1h.  
  
Happy trading

I've only become engaged in this thread over the last several days (with many hours spent reading/researching). I've been keeping track of different people's settings along with changes that they've made. I'll probably post some kind of summary post soon as I'm about to deploy a number of demo tests based on settings from some of the more successful installations to date.  
  
The problem (or maybe the beauty, depending upon your perspective) with these long threads is that they meander and at times it's very difficult to piece together exactly what others are doing.  
  
These threads operate best when the first post points to an actively managed Web page which includes the following: FAQ, links to popular settings/versions/docs and/or key posts. Anything less than this leads to lots of folks wandering around asking the same questions over and over. (Hey, sort of like life huh?)  
  
I'm aware of the accrete's Firebird mirror site ([http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...a-archives.htm](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives.htm)) which has some versions but doesn't yet have v2.0.  
  
Maybe that site could be updated and we could all point to it regularly. Or, maybe if I really get going with this EA I'll just go ahead and create the kind of site that I think is needed. But, with any creation comes an obligation to maintain (sort of like raising kids!).

I inquired elsewhere about a tool to help track historical negative float. Viola! Some kind soul pointed me to the attached Equity Logger EA which tracks and logs to a CSV file changes to account equity. I think this is a perfect tool for testing/monitoring EAs such as Firebird where negative float can have a huge impact. I now have it installed on all of my systems which get into negative floats. Over time I may make enhancements to this EA in which case I'll be sure to share them here.  
  
Enjoy!

Billworld - where would you attach equitylogger? You say it's an EA but surely it cannot go onto a chart with FB installed?

Some kind soul pointed me to the attached Equity Logger EA which tracks and logs to a CSV file changes to account equity. I think this is a perfect tool for testing/monitoring EAs such as Firebird where negative float can have a huge impact. I now have it installed on all of my systems which get into negative floats. Over time I may make enhancements to this EA in which case I'll be sure to share them here.

My thoughts exactly.  
  
  
  
If you use it as a ea..would it not replace the Fire Bird ea.....???

Skyline a question...  
  
  
Would it be possible to add a feature where the ea placed several lots in one order with several different stop losses. therefore removing lots as it moved through the traded.  
The expert works by taking profit out of a trade at various take profit levels.  
  
I found this ea which works well on manual trades.

Select a Broker. Then register for a Demo account. Then download the MT4 Platform. Then install MT4 Platform onto your PC. Then click Help in top Menu Bar. Then click Help Topics. Then you have User Guide that explains how to get started. Then read Auto Trading section on how to use EA.

Yes definitely it's possible ! My friend OrangeRoshan called this method defensive trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I did that in my latest Skypips v1.5 with really good result (1500 pips since 20 Oct in demo forward testing) , but please at this stage don't ask me for Skypips version because actually is under test and further development.  
I will be happy to share it in this forum and I'm planning to open a new specific thread about Skypips but only if this board will enable author's thread to be able to change first post forever otherwise a lot of confusion will be generated like in this thread where new good modification was made but I cannot edit my first post to add them ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)

My brain is failing could someone help me.  
When using the Equitylogger EA the following lines of code   

Inserted Code
    
    
    double b = AccountBalance();
    double e = AccountEquity();
    double m = AccountFreeMargin();

Inserted Code
    
    
    datetime time = CurTime();

and then   

Inserted Code
    
    
    FileWrite( handle, time, AccountNumber(), b, e, m )

creates the excel file shown in the image below. I can't figure out the time which is column A I think. Is CurTime() in seconds from zero GMT plus date ? or not? If some one could tell me how the last entry in Col. A is read. It was logged at aprox 9:00 GMT and at 10:00 server time on Alpari and 01:00 my time.

Try to display A column as a date , excel should convert it automatically into a date.

I hope that everyone who has benefited from this thread will support Skyline in this proposal. This thread is responsible for the Firebird version most of us are using.

Thanks, I must be at a real mental block. I still can not view it. I placed the following test code in the EA  

Inserted Code
    
    
    Print( "time =", time ); // nv
    Print( "current time =", CurTime() ); // nv

and the info printed out in the experts tab agrees with the numbers in Col. A of the spread sheet. I decided to attach the spreadsheet this time. Could someone try to read column A. Maybe my excel has a problem. It is probably me though. Both excel files should be the same. Thanks

nvwine,   
They are identical in values. one has column A in scientific notation. Select all values in that column A and click Format in upper menu, then click Cells, then select Number tab, then select Number in Category pane, then set decimal to 0 and then click OK.

The problem with the date field is it that it is in unix format, or something. Google 'date/epoch converter'. The number you have is the number of seconds from Jan 1st 1970 00:00 hours. I have an excel formula that converts date to epoch, but not the otherway  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
     seconds from epoch = ((A3-25569)*86400)+(B3*3600)+(C3*60)+D3

  
where A = date in mm/dd/yyyy format  
B = Hour  
C = Minutes  
D = Seconds  
  
I think MQ4 has a built in converter as well, just have to look in the resource book.

cgldsmth, glenn5t  
  
This EA only looks up account info, you can slap it into any unused chart. Every time that chart recieves a quote tick it will check the equity and balance, etc... So pick a chart that has a good volume ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Money Ma$ter,  
Thank you for your kind help. However the attached indicator shows only 2 bands with very tiny arrows of position taken. No MACD or other indicator. Any possibility to change the size of the arrow and have the template that shows full detail on your trading chart.  
thanks again for taking time to address my request.

pig,  
  
I sent you two messages.   
  
In the first message (page 103, post#1531) I responded to your request for a chart. Thus the **FIRST** message contained a chart for the FireBird EA that shows "lines" representing market price (buy or sell) and profit level for trades executed by the FireBird EA. Also included with that chart was a MACD indicator that I use.  
  
You then requested an indicator. The **indicator** I sent you in the second message (page 103, post#1534) has 2 "bands" that FireBird uses for trading. You must apply this indicator to your chart that has FireBird running on it. Once FireBird executes a trade you will see everything on one chart (except the MACD unless you add it).   
  
Hope that helps.

You were right, my brain didn't function properly this morning. I'll add MACD to chart that will do the job. thanks

Hi Skyline,   
I support and agree with you 1000 percent. Even though I just start to forward test your system few days ago. You have big heart and trying to help others to succeed. Many of us will benefit from your system and enjoy Forex trading once again. For what you have given to us on this forum I for one can’t thank you enough and believe others will do the same. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)></o![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)>

Sorry, should have provided clarification. Just open up an additional chart and apply this EA. It won't interfere with FB. It simply logs account info (e.g. balance, equity, margin).

Hi  
  
1) With glenn5t's help, I have FB v63G-TS trading on a demo FXLQ (MultiBank Trader) which allows mini (1K) lots. It would not operate in FXDD 10K lots. Can this be achieved in FXDD for instance?  
  
2) When trading several pairs in the same account is there any special requirement, like a new labelling for the EA, or is it straightforward as is.  
  
I'm glad to see that skyline's request to edit details is being considered by Merlin. Up-to-date summaries can really help tired old eyes.  
  
Thanks

Hi, I am getting an error message trying to search the forum, please excuse if this has been asked before.  
  
I have a demo account with North Finance Co., and I did not find out what timezone they are in.  
  
How important is that setting, and how could I find out?  
Thank you so much. 

Steve

FireBird Results  
  
FireBird closed only one trade for 5 pips in the last 36 hours. Currently carrying a **-$1,600.00** float and $900 of that is the loon. I still expect each trade to become profitable.

Please understand that people on this thread get tired of reposting settings over and over and over again. There are settings on the 1st page of this thread. And if you will read this thread, you will find other settings and explanations.

My Firebird is running fantastic on my live account. I think there are several people here having success with a wide range of settings but here is mine.   
  
I am running Firebirdv63G-TS on a 5 min chart. I am using a 15 min timeframe. Stoploss is at 300 and pipstep is set at 37. I am trading AUDUSD, GPBUSD, and EURUSD.   
  
I had originally put Phoenix on this live account but it went down quickly. Firebird has almost made up my loss in two days. For me these settings are perfect because I have almost no float and right now the float I have is positive.

You are right and I have thanked glenn5t. His settings are working for me. I also have thanked Skyline, Mono and everyone else working on or testing Firebird. We have a good little community here. I am also looking forward to the new EA from Skyline which I think is based on Firebird. I am sure it will be great.

Well, I have tried out FireBird version v63G with a bit modification on my own, seems to perform well. So far, 2 trades win with live account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Since, I know programming and a bit of experience in trading forex, I also develop my own EA and also tweaked FireBird v63G with auto increasing lots.  
Thanks for having me opportunity to download the software. FireBird's algorithm looks reasonably good technical analysis strategy developed. I really admired the original developer of it. He must know a lot of stuff in forex and each currencies behaviour, I really salute.  
By exchanging ideas in this forum, we surely can develop a good and consistent profit of EA that everybody can benefit from, hopefully ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Glenn5t, I have been following this thread for a while, and also am running the EA on several Demo accounts, and I think I am going to open a live account. If I followed this correctly, your account is with NorthFinance, correct? Are you satistfied with them, and what leverage did you choose please?  
  
I wanted to thank you, and of course everbody here for the amazing information you provide.  
  
Does it help to fine tune the EA with my test results? I am not sure if you already have enough people 'helping' here. 

Steve

Traderone,  
I don't know if this is the actual reason, I posted this today on the Phoenix thread.  
  
  
As I feel most do, I use the present Strategy Tester and available data to help me develop EAs. Backtest bar data is basic OHLC data. LIve data would contain the interlace movements within each bar. Until LIve tick data is recorded, purchased or made available from Brokers, my confidence in Backtesting is moderate at best. As posted earlier, IBFX Broker plans to offer Live tick data in near fulture.  
  
As important as I feel about using Live tick data to backtest, it is not my only concern. I also see difference from my Demo to Live results on several EAs, including Phoenix and Firebird. I've seen and have been told that after Demo charts are checked to confirm good entry points, that in Live trading more bad entry points are seen. I feel one reason is that Demo order execution is instant and Live trading can have delays many times between order request and order execution. One delay can be whether your Broker is providing tick data feeds direct or through a Trading Desk, and how they filter the data. Another reason is on low volume pairs, Live trades are not executed until minimum volume is accumulated. I don't know what is the minimum volume, but I have manually executed orders and they did not go though and FXDD advise this was the reason.  
  
The slippage variable has no effect in Demo testing, but does on Live trading. Live trading can have either, if slippage too high, order execution to be many pips away from order request. Or miss the order completely, if slippage too low. You do not see these effects in Demo or backtest.   
  
To try to summarize, I think using Live tick data for backtesting is critical, and at present, we will not see identical results between Demo and Live trading.  
  
Everyone should ask their Broker if they have Live tick data feeds now for Strategy Tester. If not, do they plan to offer one soon. If someone finds a Broker providing Live tick data for MT4 Platform Strategy Tester, please post the Broker name.  
  
Well, enough rambling on my part. Everyone have a great weekend.  
  
Wackena

Another week comes to a end  
  
  
Firstly thankyou for the kind words. Melissa and dswk...Iam glad I can help.  
  
pipsteve.....my live account is with IBFX..I have a demo with NF..but you must realise that NF use different servers and the one they use for live accounts is more reliable.  
  
for the new people once again: my settings are.....TP 50...TS 20...Pipstop 37...5min charts on a 15 TF.  
Three pairs GBP/USD.EUR/USD and AUD/USD...  
  
Once again the week produced 450 pips...with 0 losses and as I write this the float is 7% of the account.  
  
I have now been running live for 7 weeks with no losses....  
  
As I have said before I belive Fire Bird v0.63G-TS has achived my aim which is to maximise returns and minimise risk...  
  
therefore I will stop tinkering with it and now turn my attention to Version 2 on a standard account.  
  
After all the way [FBs](/brokers/fbs "View FBS Broker Profile") going we will all be trading Standard accounts in the near furture...  
  
Have a great weekend   
  
Glenn.

Hi Traderlismiss,  
I am also testing v63G-TS and it works very well. Stop is also at 300 and pipstep at 40.   
My TP is 50 and TS 30.  
If you have TP 30 you don't need TS, so you can switch off TS. or do you use a TS lower than 30?   
I am also tested around 10 different versions of FB like v065TF from an other forum, but I think v63G-TS is the best one.

Thanks and you are right. My TP is set to 50 and I am sorry for incorrectly stating it was 30. I have answered that question too many times in open forum and in pm and made a mistake.  
  
Thanks for pointing this out and I will go back and correct it.  
  
Everyone have a great weekend!

Thankyou....I to have been trading for around 6 years so I guess its a matter of haveing been there done that....lol  
  
For me one of the big considerations is the range of a pair..and thats why I use the higher pipstep for the GBP/USD as we know the GBP can range up to 377 pips from a breakout where as the EUR/USD tends to trade in a smaller range up to 144 pips from breakout....  
  
Therefore it would be a possible consideration to reduce the pipstep on the EUR to a lower number...this may give a higher return...  
  
However Iam happy with the present setup and therefore Iam leaving it alone as I said above.

Glenn,  
  
You are right, Forex took me also a lot of time and money but now it works for me, and it's really a matter of beeing there and doing the work.  
Ok I will enlarge the pipstep in gbp. Thanks for your answer, you know I am a beginner in the use of ea's.  
  
Wish you a nice weekend.

Did you get these results by backtesting or with a live demo account???  
  
Backtesting doesnt work, I have compared real time results with 90% accurate backtest data, and they dont match at all. I think backtesting is useless.

I agree, back testing does throw up many "good' results that do not result in same % in live testing or on real accounts. Look at Phoenix. Harry Hendrick has done a fantastic job on his EA and is doing so well in the competition. But how many people can get the same result in a live account?

I can tell you that Firebird is performing well in live and demo accounts with the right settings. I had originally loaded Phoenix live after having success in demo but it performed terrible live and since then, my demo account are bad as well. I agree that Hendrick is doing fantastic in the competition but I tested with several of the people in the Phoenix forum and only a few that I know are claiming to do well in a live account. I think Hendrick's Phoenix does very well in a tight range market but very poorly in a trending market. I still am watching the Phoenix forum for improvements but right now Firebird is the one.  
  
Thanks

I agree Melissa , the main problem that I can see with Phoenix is SL too tight to be able to let EA (based on the same Firebird concept) to develop its trades. On other hand we have to be really really careful about higher SL and trade with lower lot to avoid big losses ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Somewhere there is a posting on how to acheive 99% quality backtesting in MT. They went ito detail about importing history from alpari, etc... I saw it once, but can't find it now. Anybody know where it is hiding??  
  
Thanks

ps FB up about 50% this week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Float is about 20% of Account Equity, working on a MM routine that will hopefully streamline out float issues.  
  
Another thing.. I was messing around with backtesting GBPUSD, and I was using different percents from .05 to .15 using a step of 1. and the proffit was not what I had expected. .06 had the best, then .09, and .08, .12, then .05. I might be new to this detailed backtesting and optimizing, but I thought it would be a smooth curve from the best to the worst, not jumping all around like that ???

Thanks for sharing Glenn. Excellent results. To be clear, last time I jotted down your settings (which was just a couple of days ago) you had TS=15. (I got that from the post where you stated "so my final settings are TP 50..TS 15...and pipstep 37".) TS=20 is your new TS, correct? You made the change due to volatility with some of the pairs?  
  
Thanks again!  
  
Bill

Depends upon the EA, how its coded and the nature of the strategy. It is possible (and not too difficult to do) to have backtest results match forward tested trades.  
  
Many people poo-poo backtesting. But, with all fairness, there's a lot of variables involved.  
  
I don't yet have backtesting vs forward testing experience with FireBird. So, I can't speak to its relevance here. Maybe that's the point you were making?  
  
Cheers

Yes the percentages are from the envelope settings, using v63g-ts.   
  
Are you refering to the optimizing results?

Not exactally, I have that document. But I remember seeing a post or a couple of posts regarding backtesting in MT4, and how to make it near 100% quality. It went on to explain how to import history, and how to make sure that the version you use for backtesting doesn't connect to any account, or it will over write the history file, etc.....  
  
Thanks

It's a .pdf document really usefull written by Hendrick (Phoenix's creator) , on how to have 90% modelling quality (max possibly with strategy tester) not 100%.   
It's located in first post of Phoenix 2007 thread.  
Anyway here's link to pdf [http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...chmentid=11627](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/attachment.php?attachmentid=11627)

But have you tested all versions with the different setups. The settings, to me, are as important as the version if not more so. I have tested a few versions and it seems the v63g-ts works best because you can set your take profit much higher and then let the TS take care of you if it does not reach the full TP.

so when you say "losses" do you mean the trade closed at the trailing-stop?

All my trades for this week so far are in the wrong direction. I know they will turn around but I am wondering if everyone experienced sell trades on the GPDUSD, EURUSD, and AUDUSD?  
  
Thanks

Melissa  
  
  
Mine are as well...all short...  
  
Thats why its important to trade only a few pairs so you maintain a good margin.  
  
Thats why iam a bit worried about **Piece Of The Pie** and his7 pairs..I only hope he has a large balance.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44b.png?v=15.1)

Yes, 740 pips.  
I am on a standard account trading 0.1 lots.  
As with most people on this tread, my settings have been changing, getting more conservative as I go.  
  
I am only trading 6 pairs now.  
Closed trades last week....  
AUD/USD 1 for 16 pips  
EUR/JPY 4 for 111 pips  
GBP/USD 8 for 248 pips  
USD/CAD 3 for 90 pips  
USD/CHF 3 for 106 pips  
USD/JPY 6 for 169 pips  
  
My float has been staying pretty constant since changing my pipstep from 10-12 to 40. All of my losses were from hitting stop losses from a few weeks ago when the USD was trending over 200 pips and my stop loss settings were in the 200 range. (See post 1495).  
  
5 trades have closed so far today for +135 pips.

Very nice ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
I wonder, could you tell me what settings you are using for USDJPY, I seem to not have any luck with this pair. I may close one trade once in a while with this pair, but not as many as you are. What percent, tp, sl, and pipstep. Are they the same for all the pairs you are trading? And if you are in a trade right now, is it long or short?  
  
Thanks  
Rusty

Hey Rusty,  
  
I am in one trade now, from about 2am Central Time today. It is a short. About 7 pips in profit right now.  
  
I am using th v1.0a for USD/JPY. Percent is 0.1, TP is 30, SL is 300, Pipstep is 40. I will probably change to the Firebird with the JPY fix so I can add the TS.  
  
I had one trade close today at 2am that was opened on Friday. It was a Long position for +30 pips  
  
Hope that helps.

re. all trades being shorts. This is why I switched to the hedge version, so at least FB makes money on it's way while trending. what I really want is some coding expert to be able to alter the TP level so that the hedge trade in the trending direction is greater than the counter-trend trade.

With all this talk of trading standard lots Firebird, I got to thinking... What is different? Isn't a standard account just scaled up by a factor of 10? If you have Firebird dialed in to where it is running good, really good. And you are happy with the percentages (float and drawdown) Then how is it anything more then just physiological having an extra '0' ? If you look just at the percentages and the pips it shouldn't be as tough on your emotions, yes, no??  
  
Having said all that, the one thing I could think I could think of that would mess it all up is not being able to trade fractional standard lots, which could mess your money management up. Any other pitfalls??  
  
MoneyMa$ter, any words of wisdom here?

You should be able to set HedgeTakeProfit variable in v1.0b2 and v1.0b3 versions to a higher value.

First off, Let me say thanks to all those whose time & effort have developed what we know, as Firebird! I love it! I have read this complete thread....and re-read at least 1/2 of it again.   
My question is this. I opened a $300. mini w/IBFX, running FB ver 2.0, percent=1.0, lots=.1 and MM on. It is trading ~ 1 penny per pip. I changed lots to 1.0 and its still trading a ~1 penny per pip. Which line do I change in order to change the lotsize traded to ~.10 per pip..or..1.00 per pip....or is MM overiding my changes due to the small size of the account?

When UseMM=true, then Lots input is not functional. You need to change the Risk input to change lot size. Risk is percent of AccountEquity you want to risk per trade.   
  
If you manually want to set lot size, then UseMM=false.

1) What 'Risk' are you using, and what is the lot size that Firebird is trading with. ('percent' has to do with the channel Firebird uses to produce trade signals, not percent risk)  
2) If you set MM to '0' or 'False' it will turn MM off, and then 'Lots' will be the number of lots Firebird will trade with.  
  
If you decide to overide the MM and manually set lot size, start with .05 lots, and watch how it works for a couple of days. Once you are familiar with it, SLOWLY increase lot size. I would set 'pipstep' to 40, that way it wont open too many trades if the trend goes against you. Float is the killer here, negative float that is. I would set 'MaxOpenOrders' to something like 3, instead of the default of 10. At 3 orders you are already 80 to 120 pips away from the opening of the initial order, assuming a 'pipstep' of 40. it couild take a while for that pair to turn around and move 80 pips in your direction, and that could take a while, all along leaving you with -float. With a $300 account, you wont last long with a high -float. What is a high -float?? that I am not sure of yet. I currently have about 15% of my Account balance as negative float. I am not sure if that is too high or not, I would like to see it lower though, maybe someone else can chime in on their Float?? Good luck, I hope this helps

My negative float is 21%. Probably too high.  
  
I will work on a more conservative firebird to get that down.

OK so MM is working... but I am not really fond of the way Firebird calculates lots for its MM routine. You could increase 'risk' to about 17 and it would then be trading .05 lots, based on a $300 Account Equity. And then your lots would increase or decrease based on your Account Equity.  
  
Rusty  
  
ps still would reduce the max open orders to 3 or so

Noel,  
  
There are many different versions as well as settings. You could probably get a good deal from reading the last 10 or 15 pages. I know there are some posted versions and settings. It couldn't hurt to read from the beginning, if you have time.  
  
Good luck,

Glenn, I don't think that is a hedge version. The H refers to a fellow named Hendrick who modified that version. It has a "safe area" calculated as another filter.  
  
The hedge version is 1.0b2 or 1.0b3.

Thanks guys...  
  
  
The 63H04-ts is doing well with a standard account at the moment...but will try v1.0.  
  
  
sinclap.  
  
I close my computer down for me on Saturday late morning and start it up Monday midday.  
No matter what the float is.  
  
With regard to changing the script/lot size....I dont know about anyone else but after all changes I have to close the browser and reboot the computer. then delete the charts with FB and open and reload them again if I dont the changes dont take place.  
  
And todate i have found v63G-ts better then v2 on a mini account...  
  
V63G-ts has run live without lose for 7 weeks.....V2 on a demo returns at best 60% .

I tried to make a search in the thread before making this question (I know how boring are always the same questions) but I did not find the answer, so I ask here:  
  
How pipstep works? I am using Firebird v. 065G TS with pipstep 37.  
I also have an open position loosing 51 pips. What should happen? When an opposite position should be opened?  
  
Thank you and sorry if question could be stupid for many readers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

with this ea it will add another position after 37 pips in the same dirrection as the last one.  
  
That is why you have to have a good margin and a nerve to see your float go out.  
  
That is why we all have the pipstep high. to reduce the float as much as possible.

Hi Glenn, This is about the most -float I have had since I opened my live account. I may disable the EA if it moves much further against the dollar. I have made a few bucks today in manual trades but I don't want this float to get out of hand. What do you think?

Hi Melissa  
  
  
Thats one option and if you recall thats what I did about a week ago just to stop the ea opening more positions then wait for the pair to come back.  
  
You have to feel comfortable with the float level and I must admit I was worried the first time I saw may float blow out , however to date it has returned to profit.  
  
Right now I have 7 open positions and they add to about -10% of float.

I have plenty of margin at this point, but I am concerned if the GBP/USD keeps climbing.....although it seems to be struggling at 1.9000. I have only had one trade hit SL in all my demo's, so I really don't think this is too bad.......yet!

IMO, not only is it OK to disable Firebird as long as the reason is based on a pre-defined rule, but I think this type of intervention is entirely necessary. I suppose most "rules" can be programmed in, but I lack the skills in that area. In my case, I stop the EA when the open trade count reaches 12 to protect my core account. Gotta live to fight another day...  
  
I've been trading a live account with Firebird since 8/15 using the "old" V63G and basic settings of SL=300, TP=30, Pipstep=40, on 1 minute and recently 5 minute charts with the following pairs: USD/CAD, EUR/USD, and USD/CHF (since 10/26). So far, the account is 131 wins and 3 losses, with 7 trades currently in float.   
  
I also make extensive use of the "only short" and "only long" settings. Newsflash everybody... Firebird WILL trade with the trend if you set it to. It takes fewer trades overall, but IMO they're more reliable trades.  
  
I never ever close trades manually, whether in profit or loss because I have not developed a good formula for doing so. I've done some back testing on the "close everything on Friday" scenerio and results were very bad. I also tested closing everything at the beginning of the month with poor results. The best results by far were when I never manually closed any trades. And I think manual intervention without a defined formula is a sign of undisciplined trading. I have a formula for stopping firebird (12 trades), and I also have formulas for setting the "only long" and "only short" functions based on trend indicators that I am still testing. I'm not trying to brag, just re-stating that discipline is the key to success in trading, whether it's with Firebird or some other system.

Thanks for the advice. I think what you have stated is very well thought out and obviously tested. I had not thought about the long only or short only option but I will consider it from now on. I would have loved to catch this trend long instead of short.

> With all this talk of trading standard lots Firebird, I got to thinking... What is different? Isn't a standard account just scaled up by a factor of 10? If you have Firebird dialed in to where it is running good, really good. And you are happy with the percentages (float and drawdown) Then how is it anything more then just physiological having an extra '0' ? If you look just at the percentages and the pips it shouldn't be as tough on your emotions, yes, no??

Rusty,  
  
The factor of 10 makes a considerable difference. Consider for example the capital requirement, the number of currency pairs in your trading basket, the number of trades open at one time which of course impacts the margin requirement. Currently, I'm working with one standard lot and up to five currency pairs which means as much as $5,000 in margin and as high as a couple of grand in float. Psychologically, it's easier to walk away because you don't want to keep seeing those high negative floats!!  
  
My theory is the settings we use successfully for mini accounts are in an inverse relationship to standard accounts so we would ratchet the settings down by some factor of "X". My current settings, posted elsewhere in this thread, return 90%+ success, but when a trade goes bad, it really goes bad.  
  
Also it may be that one of the earlier versions is better for standard lots (I don't understand why but it's possible), perhaps v.63gTS or even the "H" version. I'm currently trading with v.2 and have not used the hedge version as of yet.

Yes. Firebird is "out of the box" a countertrend trader. Watch your settings, pipstep no less than 40 will help some. Hang in there and it may reverse just a little off this big trend.

Do you anticipate more slippage or slower fills due to the use of standard lots? For my part, I plan to stay with a mini account until forced to change. I haven't checked with IBFX... With my other broker, mini accounts have a $50k limit.

Ok.  
  
  
Trending market combined with hoilday trading. gave me the first losses to the tune of 40% of my account.  
  
No pair was safe they all took losses....  
  
So after nearly 8 weeks of 100% profit I took losses..I belive thats still very good, now I know the downside of FB I will start working on reducing it.  
  
Iam allso running 63h04 and version1 (hedging)...I belive the answer is in the middle.  
  
my thinking is some pairs on version 1 and the others on 63h04 or 63G.....thats the way iam going to test.  
  
I have tested version 2 and my finding are not good so I will concentrate on the above...  
  
in the mean time my live account will still run 63G.....

isn't the problem with limiting trades that the trend will go way against your feew trades and take ages to come back, so balance stagnates possibly building up negative swaps?  
  
surely just not overleveraging and having a healthy margin is key? I also think a very large stop-loss is essential.

glenn, what was your total $ profit prior to the losses and how many $ did you lose?  
  
I would like to understand what portion of your profits you had to give back. Or if you lost more than you had made in those 8 weeks?

No I still have a very healthy account...I lost about 40% of the balance but that still leaves me with more then double the amount I put in to start with.

Glenn, Have you taken actual losses or just loss in float? I have had only one trade hit SL and that was on a demo account.

I think this EA is not suitable for implementing Trailing stop and only certain type of currencies pair are tradable with profits.   
As each currencies pair behaviour is different and has shorter exhaustion trend and might reverse. Others can trend up to very very long. If you want to trade it you must be ready with a big stop loss setting.

So, if Firebird is countertrend out of box, what seetings are making it to be less prone to those huge drawdowns?  
  
The hedging version I suspect might be less volatile..but maybe you guys have different suggestions...

Hey all....  
  
Been hit here hard as well. Went from -$35 float last night to -$165 as of now. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) Which is about -58% of my Balance . Very un-fn'-comfortable!!!! but it seems to have leveled off for now. IBFX is closed tomorrow 08:00-20:00 EST which will leave me at the mercy of the market for 12 hours. I was thinking about adding an opposite trade to my big losers to hedge them untill friday, or untill they start to move my way. I currently have about .4 lots short GBDUSD, 125 pips the wrong way. I was thinking about buying .35 or .4 lots. So that if it moved either way the float wouldn't change much, and as my original trades became less lossy, I would get rid of the hedge trades, which would have a net change of almost $0. I haven't done this before, So i am not sure it will work. I could also watch untill 2 or 3 am EST and wait to see what happens as Markets open . I was looking forward to sleeping in Thanksgiving, oh well... Does anyone have insight as to wether this will reverse??

The GBP/USD is in between the 233 pip fib 1.9111 and 377 pip fib 1.9255 from breakout.  
  
Now the 377 fib is usualy its max range. and its looking very over bought, however with the hoildays I dont expect any downward movement till next week.  
  
Thats why I closed my positions that where way out.  
  
Hope it helps.

I know, how you feel glenn5t, I am about to close out some losers to preserve what is left. Run and hide to fight another day. too bad though, 3 weeks ago the same thing happened, but I fought back. Guess I get to do that all over again. !!

Your right. but I never thought of FB as the Holy Grail. It was only a matter of time before it made some losses.  
  
I look at it this way. I was making 40% a week - The market took some back last night.  
  
But it still leaves me with a good profit on my starting balance, where else do you get a return of 100%plus in 8 weeks and thats after that loss.  
  
For me FB is great, I will keep the live account going on the same settings, and I will look into reducing any losses in the furture , maybe by running some wide ranging pairs on the hedging FB or FBh04 with the safe mode...  
  
Thats my project for the next month....  
  
But Iam not walking away or throwing it in the bin....I still belive It can work, but we all need to realise its life and nothing is perfect including ourselves....  
  
FB is the best I have seen to date.

Have no fear, I am not throwing in the towel, I am trying somethings in demo to reduce the loses, and keep FB on track ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I might regret this but it is premature for me to start closing trades. Since I have only had one trade stop out on three different demo and one live account. I think at most maybe one or two trades will hit stop. I understand protecting your accounts and I am speaking for myself only.  
  
  
Good luck to all of us.

As you can read a few of us have already closed some trades with the view of living to fight another day....  
  
I have made enough over the last few weeks to be able to and still have a good balance...  
  
Its always the million dollar question do you close and watch the trade go into profit or leave it and watch the trade go to the Stoploss taking your profits with it????  
  
I have been in this game 6 years and I perfer to exit with a small to medium loss as a large loss.  
  
  
theres always next week.

Can't disagree with that approach Glenn. I really was speaking for me and didn't mean to second guess anyone who closed trades. It is possible that this could run for another 150 pips and that would hurt. I have been following my vegas and moutecki charts and it could go either way. Vegas 4hr still pointing straight up. Again, good luck to all.  
  
BTW: If we did go much higher it would be a point we have not hit since 04 on the GBPUSD

If it holds 1.9067/1.9101 levels a violation of this zone materializes, its Aug’06 and Nov’06 highs are exposed with a break and close above these levels needed to resume its primary uptrend. If this is seen, its April’05 high at 1.9218 and its Mar’05 at 1.9327 are the next technical levels. A push beyond these levels should target its Dec’04 high at 1.9552.In addition, its daily studies remain positive supporting the above view.   
  
Thats why I closed to give myself some trading room..If however it goes into decline I have several trades lined up in the ea ..

I do agree that it is certainly possible and again I understand your decision based on your circumstances. You are a good trader and I know you have purpose and your moves are well thought out. I think my bail out spot was at 1.9200. I do however believe we are not going to break that high from this year....or maybe it is just hope. But if it is hope I did at least base it on some history.....lol.

sm31,  
  
This is my third week of trading FireBird with standard lots. I've not experienced any issues with slippage or slower fills.   
  
The issues have been:  
  
(1) large negative floats; and  
  
(2) one trade that hit SL125 after four days. (short CAD 11/13/06 at 1.1316; closed 11/17/06 at 1.1441).   
  
The closest CAD has returned toward the direction of profitability has been to 1.1382 on 11/22/06, still 76 pips in the red. Currently CAD is trading at 1.1417. So is this an argument for a larger stop loss? Perhaps SL 175? That's the issue: what settings for trading standard lots equal trading mini accounts.

Glenn5t, rusty,   
  
I know you guys will use the learning opportunity see success (L.O.S.S.) to your benefit.  
  
Chad,  
  
Tragedies are stuff Shakespeare wrote. We're traders and we realize you win a lot and sometimes win less often. But it's not a tragedy. You must always find the positive in every trading experience....even those that "go right"!!  
  
I didn't allow FireBird to open any new trades on Wednesday because of the trends. Currently have two trades open, carrying a -$540 float into the holiday, which I expect will become profitable. Most times, I get what I expect; the exception simply proves the rule.  
  
Happy Thanksgiving everyone!!

a few weeks ago I was in a similar position with a large neg float and bottled it closing many positions taking big loss, only for the market to turn around and go to all the TP levels that would've been.  
  
lesson for me: have plenty margin to be able to withstand the trend without closing.  
  
now I only would close if there is to be a large neg swap.  
  
this trend has a net positive swap so need to hang on.  
  
FB can make 100% in 2 weeks no problem, but 100% every 2 months is safer by far and lets face it still pretty amazing.  
  
It's a great EA long-term with great logic, just read any of the countertrend/contrarian investing books to see how powerful the philosophy is (when everyone's buying, sell etc..). Just needs fine tuning and debugging.  
  
there cannot be that many USD sellers left unless the CBs are really offloading but I doubt it this week.  
  
One option is to top-up the margin to weather the storm.  
  
BTW I'm using v1.0b2 so it has made money during the trend which helps.

Thank you very much for that. I will change over this weekend to the new version.  
Have a Happy Thanksgiving to all of you.  
My thanks goes to all of you here, that's for sure!! My virtual classroom. Amazing.

Why can't I find the v1.0b2 on the first post of this thread? It seems the only versions available are 1.0a and 1.0c.   
  
And in your opinion what makes the difference in the trending market by using v1.0b2. I 've been reading firebird threads for a few days, I noticed Hendrick did a lot of work in the earlier stage of its development, and he mentioned trying to use some filter to avoid big trending move. I am curious how his Phonex performed in the last big market move, I suppose phonex and firebird are cousins.  
  
Thanks

Dumped a few more this morning before IBFX closed for Thanksgiving. I still have a few left, my fingers weren't fast enough to close the 1 remaining USDCHF, but I this I will be ok. I am going to keep FB off Friday and let things clear out for the weekend, will restart on Sunday night.  
  
Happy Thanksgiving to all .

I 've been reading firebird threads for a few days, I noticed Hendrick did a lot of work in the earlier stage of its development, and he mentioned trying to use some filter to avoid big trending move. I am curious how his Phonex performed in the last big market move, I suppose phonex and firebird are cousins.

Ok, i found v1.0b2 posted on page 113, the thread increases its pages really quickly. Thanks.  
  
I read in other threads that v1.0b adds a hedge function. Although I don't really understand how it works, I think it is a good attempt to find a way to deal with the weakness of firebird.

Hello guy´s,  
  
I´m back again ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Last days was very terrible for our bird... mine on lost near 22% on live account, (use the H02 version with trailing stop on 5min TF, 2 minilot for every pair, EUR/USD, USD/CHF, CHF/JPY(best pair ever), EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF) but still up more than 120% since beginning in september...  
  
Well not the latest Version, i know, but for me it works best and i see much people here lost more...  
  
I thought long long times about how can we make this baby safer... In my oppinion the only way is to implement a slow martingale, not double every order but maybe encrease with the factor 1.5... so we can close all the orders at a small pullback and we don´t have to wait until price reaches the lowest TP Level from the first order...  
__**  
Examlpe:**_**  
Now price is 1.1500... Bird goes short, price runs up to 1.1740... so if we had a pipstep from 40 now 8 orders are open and floating makes us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)....  
  
So let´s say we start with a half minilot, open the next order with 0,75 minilot, next with 1,13 minilot... and so on. Reduce pipstep to 30 pips and increase lotsize with the factor 1.5 (see pdf attached)  
  
Only a 60 pips retracement are enough to close the orderblock postive (look pdf)...**   
  
_That´s the only way we can make this baby safer in trending markets _,_ now if the price runs 240 pips away it need a 240 pip retracement to close all orders, after 60 pips are enough...  
  
Maybe there are some coders who can code this into the EA... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks for your help !

That idea sounds like a combination of firebird and 10point3.   
  
mt.trader, i read somewhere that you said v1.0b was based on your idea. What do you think of the hedging function now? Thanks.

anyone has experience with openinghour and closinghour. I tried to set these up with openinghour=16 and closinghour=12 (gmt=0) but no trades were open for 3 days, i am using firebird v2. i am not sure what I am doing wrong. let me know if you guys have these 2 functions working. thanks.

Yes, was my idea, thanks to wackena for coding !  
  
Well, u are right, a mix between 10piont3 and Firebird, should work, regrading hedging, yes i still think it´s a good idea, especially in times like this hedging will protect your account and add profits, in the end the hedge EA will give better returns but also deeper pockets are needed in sideway markets...  
  
Hope that helps,

That helps a lot for me to understand v1.0b.  
  
Some of my thougts on firebird and 10point3.  
10point3 is supposed to follow the trend at the very first entry, but ironically it usually ends up counter-trend. These two EAs also increase their positions when against the market, the difference is 10point3 is far more agressive. They all work best in the ranging market.  
  
I think maybe the best thing for these two EAs to win, is to accept the loss at certain point in the big move, and start all over again. I read somewhere that trending market only accounts 30% of the time. The EAs will win as long as the profit made at 70% of market time exceeds the loss incurred in those 30% of market time by certain margin. I think some people have the feeling as well.  
  
Just my two cents.

Another thought, maybe it's a good idea to have a hybrid of firebird and 10point3.  
  
10point3 tends to buy at the top and sell at the bottom. At least firebird won't do this.

Hi,   
  
I put some new changes in fb63vf03.  
1) Add SerialNo. If you want to restart a new FB but don't want to touch the orders opened by the old EA, set the SeiralNo different from the old one.  
2) Add an advanced/regular trailing stop. The old trailing stop only sets the stoploss 5 pips away the current market price once the market price goes away <TrailingStop> pips from the open price. It would be easily hit due to the volatility. Choose UseAdvanceTrailingStop would set the trailing stop in the normal behaviour, i.e., trailing stop will jump in <TrailingStop> pips.  
3) Add Hedge option. Set UseHedge true for hedge option from v1.0b2.  
  
I really doubt how much the hedge can help. Can someone post the backtest result using hedge option?

First of all I would like to say many thanks to all of you who have been involved in developing process so far.  
I started to try out this great piece of artwork yesterday. Although I have a question about the system - What does the comments in upper left corner means (maxDrowDown; CurrentDivergence; Drending market down and up and a numbers behind those comments)?

Sorry to hear that. Is it real money?  
I would like to show some info from my test. I have modified the FB with:  
1). Hedge  
2). Increase position size by factor of 1.666.   
  
Initially, I though with such approaches, I could protect my account.   
But it went from about 800$ in IBFX MIN acount to about 30$ this morning in a few days. No meaning to show my statement, just like to warn that the suggestion of increase position size can not protect the account, it would blew out the account more quick. I think the important for the system is to pick up right ranging pairs.

Yes it was the real stuff. I think the hedge version would have to be tested for a long period before I would use it. It seems everytime I go live with a new idea or account, we see all time highs or lows or market conditions that never existed before. I will make it all back on the way back down though.

Don't feel alone Melissa. Just glad I had a 40 pipstep instead of the 20 I used to use for a while! Still I've lost 33% of a live account. Ouch.

I hear you traderlismiss,  
  
Ok, after grabbing +740 pips last week, this week I got bashed.  
  
BUT there is always a positive to learn  
..... The positive I can gain of this.....  
  
Since 10/20, running Firebird 63g-ts, live, 24/7, 0.1 lots  
  
EUR/JPY 12 closed winners / 0 closed losses / 3 in float  
USD/CAD 30 closed winners / 0 closed losses / 2 in float  
USD/JPY 19 closed winners / 2 closed losses / 3 in float.  
(all closed by Firebird)  
  
I have shut down the other pairs until I gain back some of the losses from this week.

Good post and I agree with you. I know that I will probably never activate the GBPUSD in EA again. But I will use it to make all my money back and ride it back down. This is Forex.....bad with good and all that.

GBPUSD wa a culprit for sure, but over the last few days USDCHF, and EURUSD both went 150+ pips the wrong way for me. We need to find a way to keep FB out of the trends, and once in a trend, get OUT. Maybe place a trade in the directin of the trend, and then wait to see what direction it will continue in. If it keeps going against us, close the original trades and keep the trades in the direction of the trade. If it reverses, close the trade we just placed. Maybe not as simple as that, but i hope you get the ideas.

Has any of the programmers here looked at some of the EA's that performed well in this trend? Pip_boxer is one that comes to mind. I am not wanting to quit Firebird, just gets some fresh ideas.

I switched to PIP_boxer, nothing but profits so far. I like FB, and I will wait for a fix.

Good Post,  
I was just hoping some of the people who worked so hard on Firebird could look at other code and come up with something. I will say that I did not have the exact same problems with my demo Firebird using 30min charts. Not as many trades opened but it did not get beat up in this trend.

Morning.  
  
Just a view of the next few days for us to think about over the weekend.  
  
EUR pushed to a high of 1.2975 yesterday before closing at 1.2947 forming a spinning top candle at the end of the day. It was seen heading towards yesterday’s high in early trading this morning. This suggests that upside gains and possibly a break and close above 1.2981/1.3000 levels could be seen in the days ahead.   
  
For all with shorts....Sorry....

I found this threat about a week ago and have spent some quality time with it so far. Since I am quite new in forex I do not know if my suggestions to improve the EA have any value at all. But since I do not want to be just a taker here it is.  
I noticed this Friday during that big fall (USDSHF) around 08.30 that in left upper corner there was a remark - Trending Market DOWN. And for pair EURUSD around the same time it was remark - Trending Market UP.  
So here is the question can we use those remarks? And the answer to I think we can since the remark was created by EA.  
So can we but a little code to EA that when the signal is:  
• Trending Market DOWN then the EA will initiate SELL trade  
• Trending Market UP then the EA will initiate Buy trade.  
Those trades would have two termination criteria:  
1\. Standard ST and TP (according to settings everybody use)  
2\. Trade is active until the signal about market trend is active  
Those trades will stay open until one of the parameters (witch ever comes first) mentioned before is met.  
  
So that was my idea how to reduce losses trending market.

The only trouble I see with the idea is that FB works of a price channel therefore any movement outside that channel by a predetermined percentage will trigger the ea.  
  
Therefore in a ranging market (70% of the time) it works well as we all know.  
  
maybe if we use the information in the top corner (trending Up) to close all positions untill the market starts ranging again.  
  
In my case FB made some 350% return in 7 weeks. if I had close all positions at the start of the move to a trend sure I would have lost some money but I would have been able to start it again when it returned to ranging.  
  
Just my thoughts....

I agree, if we try to make the EA do everything, it wont work best where it was designed for. The only thing I can think about changing to take advantage of a trending market is to extend the TP level as the market trends in our favor.. BUT when it goes against us, it really goes against us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) This may not be avoidable, but we neeed to minimize the damage some way. Maybe analyze CCI, and/or MACD, as the markets trend, and if it reaches and sustains a pre defined level, FB will close the trades. Maybe?? Just throwing ideas out right now.

Well I have to agree that if we change the EA totally it may not work in situations it should work.  
And there is always manual trading available in case we see the indication.  
But not to throw that idea away totally I have question about it – As long as I know there is not possible to attached two EA-s to one chart. Correct me if I am wrong! So, can we make a new EA to run it on parallel chart with the chart Firebird on it and the new EA would get the signal to initiate trade from Firebird. (Basically we would have two identical charts open:  
Chart A we could have Firebird on it   
Chart B we could have new EA on it).  
  
Is it possible?

That is possible but... well I do not sit in front of computer 24/5. So it would be good if that function could be automated

Since the Pip Boxer ea was mentioned in a couple of above posts, i'll chime in and say for my demo testing the ea has been averaging +500 pips each week since it's release, with rarely over -30 to -40 pips float at any given time after close of a given day/week. The other reason i "switched" was it works on breakout patterns which is how i trade manualy so it makes sense to me.  
  
. . . now back to our regularly scheduled program . . .  
What to do with a great EA (FB) that gets its butt kicked once there is any sign of a trend? That question has been asked since day one of this thread and still no solution found that i've seen/read.

I agree, since other ea's systems have been talked about I have been using OrangeRoshan's method for setting the days trends for my manual trading...  
  
Now If we can use this method whichs works of the daily candle from the previous day then FB would work within a 24 hour time frame.However the down side would be in a strong trending market we are still likely to get trades several days old that are a long way out, in that case maybe a close after so may hours...thus taking a loss but a managed one.  
  
Just my thoughts..

I have had a demo EA running of Orangeroshan's method, written by Skyline who started this thread. I have been running it for about 2 weeks with not so good results. I do like Orangeroshan's method and manually it works well. Problem for me is I am rarely up when it breaks the previous days high or low and it is designed to grab a few pips and run. I really believe that some of the programmers who have worked on Firebird need to get involved if they are not too busy working on something new. Firebird is worth being saved but it can not be trusted in it's present state. (0NLY MY OPINION)

I do not run the ea...I only use the method manualy...and inconjuction with other indicators I pick up quite a few pips, this morning it has broken the resistance and already iam up 15 pips...  
  
he also has a SRDC method two out where they discuss over filters.  
  
I raised the method from the point of view that its works of previous daily figures therefore moving away from the envolope/channel method.

Fadi,  
  
Not sure I agree with either of your assertions. First, I think we have all just proved that Firebird does not work well in a trending market and nothing including pip_boxer works well during news. With expanded [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") and whipsaw effects, I would never trust an EA to news. But bottom line it may be good for programmers to see what each do best and try to fix Firebird by using some ideas from other EA's.

First, i want to start backtest, then forwardtest, then live!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
FB is going smoothly when lot size is 0.1 (default), when i change it to micro lot (0.01) it's not working.  
Maybe i have to modify it from source code?  
  
I choose neuimex because it supports micro lots and allow deposit using e-gold. I love northfinance too, but it doesn't support micro lot.  
  
Still on my journey to find suitable broker and EA....

yes! I DO **READ** your post.  
It's not working.  
I'm connected to internet and neuimex server, I use the same TF, same start and end day, everything is same except LOT SIZE.  
Thx

Infact, Skyline, flew all the way from Italy just to meet me personally!! LOL Fired up. I mentored him personally up to level 4 and he said, he is going to do an EA on this method.  
  
I think he can do it because, he has been calling and emailing me, about debugging the result. He really wants to become a Jedi!!  
  
I dont normally do 1-1 in such a short notice, and probably i will not again for a long time.  
  
Good Potential!! LOL

Great! My question is for Skyline and probably should be addressed in a different thread but here goes. My problem with the EA you wrote for Orangeroshan is that I get loss in both directions. It crosses the daily high or lows, does not collect enough pips to TP and then stops out, then does the same in the other direction. This has happened several times.   
I really like Firbird and know that you were working on Skypips which I believe was to be based somewhat on Firebird. First, how is that working out? Second, have you written a new EA or fix for the Orangeroshan method.  
Thanks,

Hi Melissa yes i know, my first EA on Orange's method had a lot of bug infact as you can see I didn't post any other version because I'd like to learn as much as I can about that method so I meet Orange personally and he teached directly and I want to thanks him so much!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)   
Well it was expensive for my pocket (travel, hotel, and so on..) but it has been worth it ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) Infact from my first backtesting EA could double account in a week but i'm still developing it since it's not still completely coded full level 4 method ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Traderlismiss, et al:  
  
I have been testing FB for about 6+ months. Both live & demo. As we know FB does horrible in a trend and hits SL causing massive losses. I have found that v 63H04TS_MM, does the best job, but it needs to close trades after five days. As stated in the preface ~ 90+% of trades close in profit within the first five days. I was in the process of doing this and was making progress, when the latest trend hit over Thanksgiving. None of my trades was older than 5 days, most only 2 days old, but I still got stopped out during the night while I was asleep and lost about 30%.  
  
I have been reading about the Goblin EA on TSD Forex and have just loaded it tonight. It looks at Daily Trends and determines whether they are strong or weak and in which direction. If the trend is strongly up, you buy only on the dips; if the trend is ranging/weak downtrend/weak uptrend, you can buy or sell; or if the trend is strongly down, you sell only on the rallies.  
  
If something like this could be incorporated into the envelope of the EA, so that it would always be looking at the overall trend, it might prevent a sudden calamity. The other thing that might help reduce losses is that if the EA senses a strong trend, that it automatically closes all positions until the more ranging scenario returns, thus preventing the EA to run the full amount of the SL.  
  
This in combination with a reduced number of pairs open, pairs to be closed after 5 days, and then incorporating the ideas above. Any programmers game for tackling this?

Great idea. I agree 100%.  
  
Actually, I want to propose this idea to bluto, who created goblin on TSD Forex . But I am afraid he is too busy working on goblin at the moment. Hope some other code guru can work an EA out of this.

Firebird has one of the better trend analyzer (iFXAnalyzer) already coded in the EA. It is just not used. Using this trend analyzer can help to not enter repeated PipStep orders during wrong direction sustained trends. But also there must be method to exit orders that have been caught up in wrong trend direction before they reach max stoploss. This will reduce the number of trades and there can be several days of no trading during strong trends. While running Ea on M1, M5, M15 or M30, the trend analyzer should be based on higher timeframe (H1,H4 or D1) to better indicate sustained trends.   
  
I'm not aware of any trend indicator code that is 100% correct, or even near it. There will be occasional false trend indications that either prematurely exits existing order or does not enter order at an acceptable point. Overall, profit growth might be slowed down, but may be more consistent over time.  
  
Just a few thoughts.

is there a way?  
  
I have the EA on M1 charts:  
  
\- MA_length 10  
\- MA_timeframe 30  
\- Percent 0.1  
  
but I would like to draw the envelope it uses on another H1 chart for the same currency. Just so I get a better idea what it is doing.   
  
Is this possible?

Just wanted to say thank you for the Goblin tip, installed it a couple of hours ago, it started 5 trades, all possitive so far.

Wackena,  
  
I think you gave a very clear road map for the further development of firebird.  
  
By the way, when you say 'there can be several days of no trading during strong trends', do you mean 'there could be no rally in a strong downtrend and no dip in a strong uptrend'?  
  
Thanks  
Teamfri

Ohhh yes....  
FB is ok in a ranging market... but... This counter-trend EA is really dangerous during strong trend.  
  
Best config :  
Since you "feel" a strong trend:   
1- remove FB and accept your "losses".  
2- waiting for another phase of ranging market  
  
If not... the land is hard....

Wow, two weeks ago we were all singing the prases of Firebird. I think the bird is sick but it just needs a new influx of ideas and most of all programmers. Most of the guys working on Firebird are now working on something else. I agree that for now that Firebird is not useable. I say that because I had it on several different demos and one very sick live account with a number of different settings and all went down the tubes. I know some were testing the hedge version and maybe somebody is having some success. I hope so!

well I've tried lots of versions and settings, even with conservative ones it doesn't make enough on ranging periods without a largish float. so even if everything's closed at the beginning of a trend (which assumes we can reliably detect the beginning of a trend), closing the float removes the profit and more. very disappointing, since I had such high hopes for it.

Maybe not necessarily closing the float. How about borrowing the martingale method, as used in 10point3 and goblin.  
  
I think detecting the daily or 4h trend can help select better entry at least, reducing the chance of being against a big move from the very begining.

Fellow Traders and Traderettes,  
  
I think it comes as no deep revelation that FireBird is one of many trading tools available. It works best during ranging markets, not trending markets (again no deep revelation).   
  
If Forex is **alive and dynamic** , why trade with the same **static** strategy? When I terminated FireBird last week at the beginning of the trend, I initiated something else. For example, Sidus and Bagovino are both good trend strategies. So when seasons change and it's freezing cold/raining/snow, you don't dress in beachwear. You change clothes and dress appropriately for the season (if you don't then this message doesn't apply to you!).  
  
Ranging markets will return again, just as sure as the spring thaw comes every year. So cut your losses and shut 'er down during trends until we develop a trend-detection method, be it Goblin or some other tool. And don't cry over evaporated funds; focus instead on the profit you'll make next trade.  
  
Adapt. Improvise. Dominate.

I'm just a newbie, but i have an idea.  
Since Bagovino is good at trend strategies, we can set FB to allow **only short** position when bagovino says **bearish** , and set FB to allow **only long** position when bagovino indicates **bullish**.  
What do you think?

Yo MM  
  
I just started testing Firebird v. 2.0 AND the Fozzy Daily EA, both on same account and both only on Cable.  
  
I hope then Fozzy will catch the trending days and Fire will catch all in between ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)...  
  
See ya

Now let's do a comparison of goblin or and a potentially improved firebird.  
  
What is goblin? It is an upgrade of 10point3. It is a hybrid of martingale method with trend detection. Once the ea is launched, it enters a position in the direction of 1h trend, as long as the 1h trend is not against a strong 4h or daily trend.  
  
Suppose firebird is equipped with the same martingale method, and the same trend detection system, also follows the rule that positions are entered in the direction of 1 h trend, when 1h trend is not against a strong 4h/daily. But firebird is intrinsically more selective in openning a trade, it tries to buy on dip and sell on rally from its very birth. Therefore, in theory this improved firebird should be safer than goblin, supposing everything else is the same.  
  
Of course, goblin is subject to further test as well although seems very promising. My point is firebird still has a lot of room to improve itself. I might be right, and might be wrong.  
  
The above comparison is just for making a point. No disrespect to goblin and its author bluto at all. Actually I am very gratefull for bluto's kindness of sharing his excellent work.

teamfri,  
  
You make an excellent point and it seems promising (if not a complex programming question). I'm not up to speed on Goblin just yet but I know FireBird is outstanding in ranging markets. Many testimonials (live and demo) on micro and mini and standard accounts confirm this point.  
But...as you say Goblin requires further testing. That brings me to the Noob, demam_emas as set forth below:

Bagovino is a great trend strategy, again confirmed by many testimonials, live and demo yada, yada, yada. Using bags last week, you would have made hundreds of pips on the cable uptick. It's a simple ma cross confirmed by rsi(14), although Bagovino enthusiasts may insist on rsi(21) with fibs and retracements...kewl. In any event, it works in trending markets.  
  
demam_emas recommends incorporating bags as the lead signal so for example, when bags signals a bearish trend, FireBird would open only short trades. Recognizing full well that FireBird is a counter-trend system, we would force-feed the Bird, so to speak, to only allow shorts or alternatively establish a hedge, until we confirm the bear trend. Once confirmed (based on x number of candles) shorts are allowed and the hedge cancels the long. Moving SL to BE after perhaps 10-15 pips would lock in profit just in case bags gave a false trend signal. Just reverse the foregoing in case of a bull trend. Obviously the hedge would still cost a few pips but it would be much less than the cost we incur now going to SL.  
  
Collaborative effort ladies and gentlemen. Please criticize, question, tear this apart. But I think it makes sense and moves in the direction of the trend we want.

I've been following trends with Firebird in my live account since mid October. Given today's price action, I hope everyone has been applying some kind of trend analysis to this EA. It's not rocket science (i think I've said that before...). Just pick a few of your favorite MA's and make a decision when they cross.  
  
There has been a comment or two that "force feeding" (props to Monema$ter ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) for the term) Firebird might result in too few trades opening to cover the inevitable losses when a trend changes direction. My information indicates otherwise. For example, I don't think anyone would disagree that the USD/CHF has been in a bear trend since October. I began trading the pair in my live Firebird account on 11/6 with the EA set to "only short". Since then, 17 USD/CHF trades have closed for profit. No losses and no trades currently open on that pair. So, it seems that pullbacks during a trend are sufficient to trigger a reasonable number of profitable trades.

Nice to know. Now next steps are :  
1 - Are we able to detect the trend by programming ?  
2 - If yes, can we modify the code to execute FB only in BUY or SELL during the trend and return to FB original when the market is range...  
  
Any ideas ?

Currently my Firebirds are resting, after getting their feathers knocked off for the last 2-3 weeks. But "force feeding" them to trade the small retracements of the trends sounds promising, But what time frame for the trend, and how to define it in code? That is the issue! With the holidays comming up, and work, I am bogged down a little, and will probably just manually trade a little, and if I see the right moment I'll put firebird back on a pair, just to see how this will work. But right now I am just regrouping.  
  
Rusty  
  
ON EDIT: We may need a significantly smaller SL, so that if a trend develops while we have open trades, FB can close the trades, or wait till SL. Then open the trade in the correct direction.  
  
Does anyone know if this could still be considered Firebird??

I'm currently defining trends based on the 1H chart, but I don't know whether that is the best timeframe to use. I think I'll continue with the 1H charts for awhile... at least long enough to see all the different market conditions for sustained periods. I'm no programmer so I have no idea how to add this functionality to Firebird.

oK,   
  
Homework for all the long time Firebird handlers. We need 3 different modes: Trend up, Trend Down, and Ranging. Using the same envelope parameters, whiten what +slope and -slopes will Firebird, as it stands now, work effectively (in pips over minutes, eg 50 pip rise, or drop in 120 minutes maybe too steep, but maybe 5 in 120 minutes and Firebird still works well. hopefully we can take this slope over a longer period of time, maybe 8-10 hours. I hope I explained this correctly, I am just shooting of the top of my head while I am still at my day job.

Attached is Firebird-v3.0.  
  
In an attempt to minimize bad effect of strong up or down market movements, I have coded a new Firebird to use iFXAnalyzer as an up and down strong trend indicator. The EA will not place trades during strong up or down trends indicated by chart message "Market Trending up" or "Market Trending Down". I added a Hedge function option to place reverse trade when PipStep trade is triggered. Hedge orders have ability to increase lot size. I cleaned up the EA and now there are no warnings when compiled in MetaEditor. Other added functions are described below. 

  1. UseEquityProtection -if true, close all orders when negative Float is excessvie.
  2. FloatPercent –percent of balance for equity protection.
  3. UseMM-money management.
  4. Risk-pecent of account equity to risk per trade.
  5. MaxOpenOrders-sets maximum number of open trades at same time.
  6. MinMarginLevel-below minimum Margin Level percent % trading stops.
  7. CloseDays-number of days trade is open before auto closing.
  8. LossLevel-loss amount before auto closing after Closedays.
  9. UseHedge-if true, places reverse order with PipStep order.
  10. HedgeLotFactor-hedge order Lots will be increased by this factor.
  11. HedgeTakeProfit-
  12. HedgeStopLoss-
  13. AutoCal-if true, iRSI() calculation of TakeProfit, StopLoss and PipStep. (not hedge orders)

This Firebird, as well as most other versions, is very slow in backtest. I can assure the added EA functions work. In backtest with default settings, it performed well on eurusd. gbpusd backtest was a bit shakey, but still in profit. I have not tested other pairs. I hope it performs well in Demo and Live accounts. I found better profits when HedgeLotFactor is set between 2-4.

These two months, October and November are the best opportunities to test Firebird. With such a huge north trend in place it was.

wackena,  
  
Thanks very much for paying attention and responding to trader comments on the trend issues with the Bird.  
  
Question: The code reference in v3 for "CloseDays = 10" includes a comment regarding "number of hours order is open":  
  
  
extern int CloseDays = 10; // Number of hours order is open before auto closing.  
extern int LossLevel = 250; // Loss amount before auto closing after CloseDays.  
  
Does the numerical value for "closedays" represent hours or is that literally 10 days? Another way to ask is whether the comment should say "number of days order is open".

Cable sideways, perhaps awaiting ISM report at 10:00 am est? FireBird returned four positive trades and 50 pips as currencies are ranging. This will probably end at 10:00.

_US Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported manufacturing supply purchases were less then projected and inflation was up on what was purchased. This the reason for the Dollar spanking today and most likely could carry on next week._  
  
_This is today's Forex comment for eurusd from Mizuho Bank._  
  
_**Comment: The strongest monthly close since December 2004 with November’s strong rally taking many by surprise after the stagnation of the previous six months. The Euro is overbought but less so than it has been over the last week and bullish momentum is very strong. Our first upside target at 1.3200 has been met and there is a chance of touching 1.3400 this month if we hold above 1.3000.**_  
  
_If we could only have an EA retrieve trade formation such as this daily trade strategy for Dec 1 from Mizuho. Then use the data to calculate trade entry and exit points. I don't say they are always correct, but most times they are because they make big money by being mostly correct for their clients._  
  
_**Strategy: Possibly attempt small longs at 1.3250, adding to 1.3200; stop below 1.3100. Short term target 1.3300/1.3330 and then 1.3400.**_

This is another briefing for gbpusd from Mizuho Bank. It indicates that it is probably not a good time to trade cable right now.  
  
**Comment : The strongest monthly close since August 1992 and above two standard deviations of the mean since 2004. Scary stuff especially for those who remember Sterling exit from the ERM. This time it is a bit different as it is nearly all down to the US dollar rather then something specifically British. No wonder implied volatility has exploded from very low levels. Expect big price swings and lots of hype. Do as little as possible.**  
  
**Strategy : If you really have to: possibly attempt tiny longs at 1.9750/1.9700; stop below 1.9540. Short term target 1.9875.**

Code only says "made local function by MrPip". This probably a question for TraderSeven.

I 've been following goblin closely for quite a few days, and the discussion there really made me think a lot.  
  
Personally, I think goblin is still not a real trend following system, but very much an EA with martingale method playing the main role, and I made a suggestion to transform it into a true trend following system with martingale method playing a supporting role.  
  
I think for firebird, it would also be good to transform it into a daily trend following system. We could let it follow the daily trend by using whatever indicator we feel comfortable with. We only buy in an uptrend and sell in a downtrend. And in the daily trend, there must be minor trends against it, which firebird can take advantage of them by using its strength of 'buy on dip and sell on rally'.  
  
A daily uptrend and downtrend usually lasts a few days, firebird should be good in this period. The drawdown would be the potential loss incurred at the transional period, the period market changes from bull to bear, or from bear to bull, or in the daily sideway market. Shall we cut our existing positions when there is a signal of direction change of daily trend? I think only when the averaging loss reached certain level. If we cut them too early, we might suffer in a typical sideway market. If we cut too late, we will be against a big move.  
  
For this idea, I am really not sure about its possibility of success. Just for you guys to see if it is worth trying.

Glenn,  
  
How many orders were opened?  
  
If UseMM=true, the lot size is a calculation based on Risk% of AccountEquity. If lot size is larger than you want, reduce Risk %.   
Example:  
AccountEquity = $10,000  
Risk=10;  
Then Lots will be 1.0 for 1st trade. 1st Hedge trade Lot size is Lots * HedgeLotFactor. In same example, if HedgeLotFactor=3, then 1st Hedge trade will have Lots = 3.0. For same lot size on both normal and Hedge, set HedgeLotFactor=1.  
  
If UseMM=false, then you manually set the Lots variable to whatever lot size you want. Hedge lot calculation is same as above.

Wackena can you please look into adding time management for the new FB, so no trades will be executed during given time.   
  
I tried with this code, but it did not work right:  
  
if (UseHourTrade){  
if(!(Hour()>=FromHourTrade&&Hour()<=ToHourTrade)){  
Comment("Non-Trading Hours!");  
return(0);

As requested by Michaelw, I have coded a Trade Time scheduler into latest Firebird v3.0. It is a little bit of overkill. But, it will allow to schedule up to 4 "Trading Time" zones per day and a full week's schedule to be set at one time.  
  
If UseTradeScheduler=true, then the following applies.  
  
Each "Trading Time" zone 1 through 4 has a Start and an End for each day.   
To trade all day , set "day"...Start1=0 and "day"...End4=24. This is needed for each trading day.  
To skip a full day, set "day"...Start1=0 and "day"...End4=0.  
  
**Note: EA is coded to use your Local PC Time.**  
  
Here is a Monday example.   
  
MonTradeHourStart1 = 0; - _(Trading Time zone 1 start)_  
MonTradeHourEnd1 = 8; - _(Trading Time zone 1 end)_   
MonTradeHourStart2 = 10;   
MonTradeHourEnd2 = 16;  
MonTradeHourStart3 = 18;   
MonTradeHourEnd3 = 20;  
MonTradeHourStart4 = 22;   
MonTradeHourEnd4 = 24;   
  
In above schedule, EA trades from 00:00 (midnight) to 08:00, then from 10:00 to 16:00, then from 18:00 to 20:00, then from 22:00 to 24:00.  
  
**Non-Trading Time** is from 08:00 to 10:00, then from 16:00 to 18:00, then from 20:00 to 22:00.

BenQ,  
  
Developement was on M5. On previous versions of FB, there have had good comments on M30. It would be good if both M5 and M30 could be tested side-by-side for comparison. Another good test would be to demo on different Brokers at same time also.

Thx. I turned off MM, but kept the other defaults. The hedge is coming on too early. I have a .10 lot short on the eurusd at 1.3359, and a .30 lot long at 1.3363.

I had the same. EU short 1.3357 and long 1.3363. I also got short and long on cable. A long on UJ and long on UChf. I don't know why the hedge orders on EU and GU happened. Maybe a Sunday night thing.  
  
Turning off MM does not effect Hedge orders. They are turned on/off with UseHedge variable.

At 23:05 GMT Firebird v3.1 sold 2 lot at 1.9824 and bought 6 lots at 1.9832 five seconds apart. These were GBPUSD trades on a 5min chart with MetaQuotes demo. Is this caused by the market just opening?

Yes, I think so. The Hedge order needs LastPrice of previous order to calculate entry. On first EA start up, there is no previous order Last Price, so LastPrice=0 and I think the Hedge function calculates OK entry on invalid data. After orders have been opened, then premature Hedge orders should stop. I will investigate a fix.

For the 2 lots and 6 lots orders. You have either turned off UseMM and set Lots=2. Or, UseMM=true, and default settings, Risk=5% and AccountEquity equals or is near $45,000. In either case, the HedgeFactor=3 and that is why the 2nd order was for 6 lots.

wackena,  
Thanks for the reply. I am still getting my adjustments worked out.  
  
Can I run the FB v3.1 EA on 5min, 15min and 30min charts on the same pair in the same account without having magic number problems?  
  
Keep up the good work.

Just had another double order on usdchf. Reason unknown, still investigating. It may not be a prolblem . Time will tell.  
  
I started my FDXX $3000 demo 2006.12.03 on 4 pairs-eurusd, gbpusd, usdjpy, usdchf. EquityProtection was set at 10% of balance. This only allows a $300 negative float. Last night had 2 orders closed for loses when negative FLoat was more than 10% limit. EquityProtection feature works. On my $3000 demo, I have now set FloatPercent=20 (20% of Balance=~$600 for negative float limit). Users should periodically re-evaluate their FloatPercent setting to assure, based on your Balance, you allow enough negative float for Firebird to work. While if EA is profitable, adjust FLoatPercent down to protect balance.  
  
Another suggestion is to turn Equity Protection off and let EA run for awhile to see average Float p/l and then set FloatPercent accordingly to level of protection you want.

nvwine,  
Yes, I think you can. This is the code and it seems to assign unique   
MagicNumber based on chart (Period()) selection.  

Inserted Code
    
    
     
    int MagicfromSymbol() { // included by Renato 
    int MagicNumber=0; 
    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) { 
     MagicNumber=MagicNumber*3+StringGetChar(Symbol(),i); 
    } 
    MagicNumber=MagicNumber*3+Period(); 
    return(MagicNumber);

Hopefully, this version of Firebird will handle the Hedge orders as designed.   
  
The 2 loses I've had, and they were big ones, have been OrderClose call from exceeding equity protection level. I have changed the default to PercentFloat=30. You may want to turn off EquityProtection=false. Then monitor Float p/l over time, and set PercentFloat accordingly.  
  
In this version, the following these variables will have the biggest effect on positive results.  
  
1\. PipStep   
2\. MaxTrades  
3\. HedgeFactor

I don't think so. It seems your History data may be corrupt. The EA does not calculate Ask or Bid price. It only uses price quoted from backtest data file or if demo/live from server.

I think you're right. I backtest start from 1 Dec 2006 and FB is fine. Maybe i should download history data from alpari.

Attached is report sorted by pairs for 1st week of Firebird 3.2. Early in the week had 2 loses due to PercentFloat for equity protection set too low. Turned equity protection off and had no more loses for remainder of week. could be just pure luck, but FB 3.2 handled OK the US non-farm employment report at 0830 EST.  
  
Broker FXDD - eurusd, gbpusd, usdjpy, usdchf  
Deposit $3,000  
Timeframe M5  
Balance $3,511  
Equity $3,221  
Wins 31 - Loses 2  
ROI 7.4%  
  
I believe FB 3.2 does trade slower then other versions due to no trading when trending up or trending down. There were several hedge orders that closed for profit.

FireBird v3.2 compiles fine on IBFX but on StrategyBuilder, I'm getting an error code for TimeCurrent and TimeLocal values : "function not defined". Is it that SB's version does not support those functions?

Here are my results. The changes I made to the set file seem to be in the wrong direction. I ran the EA on 3 time frames for each pair. They all had the same settings except I changed the Name_Expert string and saved the EA to 3 different names so the comment for each time frame would be distinguishable. I now find it is not easy to sort the report but anyway here it is. I ran the EA 24 hrs a day starting Tuesday through NFP.  
  
Did anyone trade 30min charts and get trades. The only 30min trade I got was when I first turned on the EA and nothing since. There may be some conflict between time frames on my demo.  
  
The hedge function seemed to work. I don't understand why the hedge trades are placed at the same time. This only seems to be the case some of the time. What causes the EA to open an immediate hedge or none at all?

MoneyMa$ter,  
Just recently, MetaQuotes (MQL4) made CurTime() and LocalTime() obsolete and replaced them with TimeCurrent() and TimeLocal(). <http://docs.mql4.com/obsolete>  
  
I think the MetaEditor in your SB account is an older version and does not have these changes in the Compile reference. You could try to update to build 200 and hopefully these errors will stop.  
  
**NOTE: To All:**  
****  
**Please make sure you use latest MT4 Platform build 200 with this EA. If using older version, EA time routines could fail to function.**  
  
MoneyMa$ter, thanks for the heads up.

nvwine,  
I see similar hedge order openings as you report. This is the way I hoped this EA would work. The Hedge Order call is controlled by PipStep call and MaxOpenOrders setting. On call for PipStep order, a Hedge Order is also called. The number of Hedge orders is controlled by MaxOpenOrders setting. Example: if MaxOpenOrders=5:   
  
1st order is normal EA call.  
2nd normal order and 1st Hedge Order are on 1st PipStep call.  
3rd normal order and 2nd Hedge Order are on 2nd PipStep call.  
  
I think what is happening is if 1st Hedge order closes before 3rd normal order is open, it throws the complete sequence off. I will investigate the sequence this weekend.

FireBird took winter holiday some days ago. South for the winter. Look for a return between January and spring, when FOMC reduces rates in an effort to spice up the recessed US economy (or awaken the lethargic economy, for those who don't see a recession).

Firebird 3.2  
  
[Broker](http://www.forexfactory.com/index.php?page=forex_brokers) FXDD - eurusd, gbpusd, usdjpy, usdchf  
Deposit $3,000  
Timeframe M5  
Balance $5,120  
Equity $4,779  
Wins 72 - Loses 7  
Open Orders 4 (Float p/l $-340)  
ROI 25.9 %  
  
Started test on 2006.12.03.  
  
I had 7 loses, that were my fault. They comprised of 2 groups, 1st for 2 loses and 2nd for 5 loses. 1st group was when I started the test and had PercentFloatLevel=10. This only allows negative Float to be 10% of Balance before it closes all orders. 2nd group of loses was when I broke a basic rule of never working on a code if EA is running. I set the equity proctection level again too low and it closed all open orders again. you can see none of the loses were sl loses. If I hadn't made these 2 miistakes, I should be up even more by a few hundred dollars with no loses.  
  
This doesn't it mean that Firebird 3.2 won't blowup sometime in the future, but it survived the NFP news on Friday. The Hedge orders seem to be very useful in making profits during both trend directions. We will need to wait and see a few major trend spikes before we know if this EA can play and not get hurt too bad in the real world.  
  
Firebird is a counter trend EA and needs a range of negative float to perform as designed. I suggest that PercentFloatLevel setting be set to allow ~$1,000 per each lot for negative float. Example: 1 lot = ten orders of 0.1 lot. To protect equity, PercentFloatLevel needs to be adjusted as equity increases. On equity increases, PercentFloatLevel can be set lower to maintain necessary amount for negative float.  
  
I can not over state the importance of protecting your equity when running Firebird EAs. It's history has been to make real impressive profits over time, just to see it quickly get wipe out in only a few days. Use the equity protection, trading time filter, manual observations or whatever it takes.

so how are you testing firebird and getting results with the settings you posted if your broker doesn't support Mt4?

HI all ,  
  
I began a demo account with NorthFinance with 5000 USD ,   
and launced the FB v3.2 on it with these pairs , EUR/USD , GBP/USD , USD/JPY and USD/CHF   
all on M5 Charts .  
  
you can see the report at this link  
<http://www.forex.gogohost.com/detailed/>  
  
It is auto updated each 5 minutes and you can filter it , and take a look and sort for the time Diff for each deal ( time toke per deal )  
  
Hope that could help :-)  
  
  
I got some problems in the code and I had to open a new dedmo account , and it was good time to change some settings in FB ..   
  
so it is a new fresh statment now but will not be deleted again , so if things went well I could then tell that the settings I made in the FB went good.

Great looking report format. If you launched FB3.2 with default settings, please set input UseEquityProtection=true; and PercentFloat=30;

I have not seen this before. I agree this does not seem to be hedge orders. Why it sent 2 simultaneous same type orders is a mystery. Were there existing orders on chart or were these the first to open. Can you please post one of the charts.

The forex.gogohost detailed report is good. You can see that the usdchf closed order was still open when these 2 trades opened and was triggered by the PipStep routine.

Wackena,  
  
I am experiencing problem with hedge feature. I change settings a lot, but to my knowledge i did nothing to turn it off. When the hedge worked it always lagged, activating 7-10 pips after the postition was hit. I had two instances when hedge should have been activated, but nothing happened. I was using settings below.

The hedge orders should be triggered along with PipStep orders. For some reason, part of the original Firebird code that tracks open orders gets confused and loses track sometimes of 1 to 2 orders. As stated this part of the original code and I will investigate possible fix.  
  
The concern I have had with all Firebird versions is its inability to handle long sustained trends. It likes long ranging markets that moves within a 300 to 500 pips range, It's true that FB3.2 with the hedge feature does better, but it also has this same problem. When we have long sustained trends like we are having now on the 4 major pairs, FB is going to get caught with open orders that keep drifting toward the StopLoss. This is usually seen after a few days and you see 1 or 2 orders on a chart that has been open for a few days. The Stoploss could be set at 500 and this would only delay the inevitable loss.  
  
Well with that being said, I think FB needs a routine to close all orders, on a pair, when the sum of all orders are in profit. With FB3.2 present default settings, Hedge orders lots are 3 times higher than standard order lot size. This should allow a point in time where the Hedge profit minus all open orders is still a profit. I think this should be a turn on - turn off function and it will be up to the user to determine if in long trending or long ranging market.

Heder,  
  
I had the same problem.  
  
Use CurTime instead of TimeCurrent and LocalTime instead of TimeLocal. Then compile again. TimeCurrent and TimeLocal are not recognized in the version of MT4 you are running.

Heder,  
You must be using an older MT4 platform. It does not recognize new code names.  
  
<http://docs.mql4.com/obsolete>  
  
You need to update your MetaTrader to build 200.

Thanks, Wackena.   
A suggestion is that the Firebird puts hanging orders against its initial position of the following one forms:   
TP: 30  
PipsStep: 30  
First to order 0,10 Lots (Stop 300 Profit 30)   
second to order 0,20 Lots (Stop 300 Profit 60)   
............ 0,40 Lots (Stop 300 Profit 60)   
If profit last order, closes all.   
It is possible

I tried the same thing and got the error. Then I checked the box 'Ask Manual Confirmation' on the EA. When the alert sounded for confirmation I noticed the volume for the order was 0.00 This is why it is saying invalid lots. The market price, SL and TP looked correct. I trade on IBFXm platform. I have not looked at the code yet but a zero lot order is causing the error. At least on my platform.

The steps are :-  
Download the FB files and put them into the exprets folder  
Attach it to the chart  
enable the Allow Live trade ( and if you like to allow the manula confirmation )  
  
if you did all that you shoud see a smily face at the right top corner of the chart..   
if that face is sad then you didnot enable the Live trading ,   
if it is happy ( smile one ) then it is working ,   
and if you dnot see it at all and just see a letter x , then click on the Expert Advisors buttom in the metatrader window at the top ( the biggest one )

Just wait .. it should AUTO sell/buy ( but hope you are in a demo account since you are new in the EA in general )

Your broker does allow you to trade .01 lots?   
  
I'll probably have to let Wackena look into it. I don't really know how to program either. More interesting I can't seem to duplicate the problem. I just turned the EA back on and it placed an order for .01 So I don't know.

Willy, what pairs did you get the error on? Did you have open trades for the same pairs on your platform?  
  
I changed my mind again. I got the lot volume = 0.00 again a couple of times in the last hour. It was on GBPUSD and then EURUSD. Firebird v3.2 placed .01 lot orders fine for GBPJPY and EURCAD during the last 2 hours. I wonder if the problem is only on XXXUSD pairs? A couple of days ago when I had the error it was on EURUSD each time. The XXXUSD pairs backtest OK. I have had other XXXUSD trades on the same pair open on the platform when the errors happened. The other trades were opened manually or with PipBoxer.  
  
In the zip file is the *.set file in use on GBPUSD and a picture of the volume=0.00 I have made no real modifications to the EA. The other picture is EURUSD which uses the same EA so same *.set file. I only added 5m to the name and changed the name_expert to show 5min inside so I could tell the testing time frame.  
  
Wackena,   
I hope this helps. Disregard half of the PM I sent you. We have an error some of the time.  
Thanks for your work

Hello willy,  
  
I checked your statement that you are using North Finance, however I don't think they support micro lots. That's probably why you got the error.  
  
Hope that helps.

nvwine,  
This is a good mystery. I've tested FB3.2 on IBFX mini and it placed orders with lot size of 0.01 on all four major pairs.

Ok , its working now anddid opened one trade for me with USD/CHF and i gained $20 from this trade on my demo account.However its not working for any other pair though i loaded the eur/usd set file in the preset folder into the firebird properties.  
Could you tell me what setting i should do to make it work with any other pair and make it work on frequent basis as it worked only once with usd/chf the whole day and could someoned tell me what triggers the firebird to open a trade?  
Thanks a lot

How many charts did you attach the EA to? You need the little smiling face up in the corner of one chart for each pair you want to trade.   
What time frame charts are you using? The closer you get to 1min charts the more trades you will get. More trades is not always better. You might want to try 5min charts to start with.

i attached it to 2 charts and i have the smile face there for both pairs.  
I am using northfinance demo,   
1)do u mean that i should just click on 5min button at the top or change the setting in firebird properties?  
2)Also is there any other variables that i need to change?  
3)How much pips should i gain with this system on daily basis?  
4)Do you think it will work differently on real account on northfinance if i deposit $800 there?  
Sorry for so much questions but i was searching for answers all the day.  
thanks

Set the chart to 5min not the properties. Things always seem to work different on a live account. At least for me. I don't think you should trade this or any other EA on a live account until you test it for quite a while and understand how and why it works.  
  
Hopefully someone else will give you their ideas and answer the rest of your questions.

1) Chart be 5M ( in the MetaTrader it self ) and donot change it in the FB properties.  
2) FB got alot of variables .. but you can begin testing it with basic settings and then deside if you will need change any of them or not.  
3) all depend on market ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) ( in one day I got 192 pip , second day was almost dead day so only got 25 pips )   
4) even if it went so well in the demo , do not go live untill you understand the FB very well , coz in live alot of things will be different ( specially your own fearing and worry about each deal you see )

**RESULTS**  
  
Today, Dec 22 at 05:05 GMT, FireBird v2[1], with MM, TS, the version just prior to 3.xx), hit TP on Eur/Aud trade opened Dec 21 at 21:45 GMT at 1.6789. TP was 18 pips, $141.70.  
  
**Here's the Good News...**  
I used cable's ranging tendency today, after the news, as the greenlight to use FireBird. Cable on the 4H is mirroring last week's behavior, which if things held true to form, indicated a relatively mild ranging market between 18:00 GMT and 00:00 or just beyond.   
  
So if the trader can determine with relative certainty that cable will "behave" (i.e., not enter a trend), then that trader can launch FireBird. This is the second time I've tried it and while 2 robins don't make a spring, we're at least getting warmer.

I have been using Firebird 3.2 on the 5min charts on the Frank, Euro, Yen and the Canadian Dollar for the last two weeks with good results. Each pair has slightly different setting regards TP, SL, Hedge TP and Hedge SL however I have noticed an interested trend.  
  
Overall, I have made ~1500.00 on the 4 pairs this week (in Demo)however I have noticed that my float is ~1500. Is there a way to profit my profit or lower the float without affecting open trades. Also if I change my presets on any pair, do they affect open orders or just new order? I assume I would have to manually adjust my TP, SL, etc.. on open trades.  
  
BTW - this forum rocks!

This may not be the appropriate place to say this, but to anyone looking at this EA who doesn't have a significant amount of Forex experience, please be careful!!   
  
Firebird in the hands of a new trader is like a 600 HP sports car in the hands of a kid. It'll go like hell for block or so... till it hits a pole. But try telling a kid they're better off with an econobox... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)   
  
This EA is *FAR* from being a fully automated system that you simply set and forget. Regardless of version, it is a tool that requires a great deal of caution and market savvy to use correctly as many people on this thread have learned over the last 2 months.  
  
Good luck and Merry CHRISTmas everyone!

iFXanalyzer is written by Renato dos Santos.  
It has been slightly adapted and put in Firebird.  
Mr. Pip reorganized the code a bit.  
  
I enclosed all iFXanalyzer related stuff.  
Also take a look a Relative Vigor Index (part of MT4 standard indicators.  
Currently I'm looking at 'Fisher transform' indicators. Beware of backpainters!

I agree with you that risk can't be totally avoided and is part of the game.  
But my personal opinion is that float should always be kept at a minimum.  
1] Because it gives a better starting point for conditions when trends really get out of hand.  
2] Even when the huge float turns into winners it doesn't mean it's very profiteble. If the money wasn't tied up you could possibly have made several winning smaller trades.  
3] Huge float earns less when you follow RM/MM rules.  
4] The money you set aside to buffer the huge DD that occure once every 100 trades means that that money isn't earning in 99 trades. But smart MM/RM can improve that situation to some extend.  
  
More on Risk Management and Money Management.  
MM/RM is no fix. It's a magnifying glass.  
It fools you when testing. It hides the real system performance.  
A system should be profiteble without MM/RM. Only then start using RM/MM  
  
MM/RM is not just scaling a few lots as seen in most EAs (but soem MM is a very good start). It's a real art that can get very complex. But it has great advantage. Not only safty wise but also speeding up portfolio growth. There is a lot of info to be found on MM/RM. If you can't find any you can start looking here <http://www.adaptrade.com/Articles/article-op.htm> Also play with their program. It's awsome.  
Also read a bit about Sharpe and/or Sortino Ratio.  
It will learn you that decent MM/RM punishes you for having a system with a huge DD. It cuts down the max. allowed lots because it keeps being paranoid about the possibility of the DD.  
As an example a huge DD system (with massive gains if it reverses) is allowed to trade 5 lots and and a system that just keeps collecting a few pips in many short lasting trades may be allowed to trade 15 lots just because it feels/is so safe.  
So the 'smooth system' collects 3x more $ per pip earned. 

May the pips be with you.

Wackena,  
  
You and the gang have done some great work since I last checked out Firebird. Firebird was so great up till the big bull move of a month ago. Do you see it being able to handle the next big move in the market?  
  
Thanks,

FB 3.2 with the hedge orders seems to be handling the market OK last few weeks. Although, holiday weeks is not a good time to critique. Whether it will survive large DD and sharp markert moves is still unknown. I agree with TraderSeven's comments on MM/RM. FB runs best when DD is low. When DD is high, probability of large loses is also high. So I'm coding next FB to close all symbol orders when min profit level is achieved after account equity is above starting deposit.  
  
Willyhopa has been demo testing FireBird V3.2 and this is his link to his auto updating Statement.

Thanks Wackena,  
  
Some very promising results here. I agree very much with the approach you and others have taken. I look forward to the Firebird future.

Hi all ,   
  
Wish you all a happy new year and alot of pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I noticed something in the FB .. and wanna you think about it ..  
it is allready coded that it close the deals if it take more than 10 days active .  
  
but why not also change the TP point when it take long time ??  
  
for example .. if the deal get normal 30 pips TP .. so FB check after 2 or 3 days if it didnot get that limit then chage the TP to 20 or breakeaven .. so it give some equity to new deals ..   
  
I guess that will be better than just wait 10 days and then close it with BIG negative pips.  
  
That is what I do in my real account .. when the deal take SO long .. I try to close it with less porfit or with breakeven to give a breath to my balance and also donot pay alot of swap with no use.

I've been running Firebird v63G-TS for just over a month now and it's going great, but just this past week it stop making trades on one of my charts (eurusd). ->This happened right after I deleted all the objects on it from the object list.  
  
I opened a new eurusd chart and applied the ea but it still doesn't work. It currently still works on my other pairs though.  
  
Has anyone else run into this problem and or know how to fix it?  
  
Thanks!

You should look in MT terminal submenu "experts" and see if there is a problem with initializing firebird.

Today, January 9, 2007, FireBird v2[1] with MM, TS generated 37 pips profit in Eur/Aud. I initiated FireBird today because cable was ranging, just as referenced in the post quoted above.   
  
Perhaps too simplistic but this is the third time, and while still statistically insignificant in that 3 robins don't make a spring, we're still getting warmer. Theory is as long as cable is ranging, then it's **safer** to use FireBird as you're less likely to see those strong market trends that kill the bird. I've only applied this theory to Eur/Aud but it should work for the majors also because if cable ranges, the majors should follow.

Well, I kinda lost interest when I lost 40% of my live account in about a week. That was after three months of testing to gain confidence.  
  
Looking at other methods now.

Hi  
  
I am studying FB. I found a document at [http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...ird-doc027.mht](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/Firebird-doc027.mht) that describes the theory behind the EA - however when I download the document the pictures in the document does not display. Can someone maybe convert the document to a .pdf or post a .doc file here - with the pictures.  
  
Would be greatly appreciated

I posted one back in post [#344](http://www.forexfactory.com/forexforum/showpost.php?p=89855&postcount=344)  
  
This was the last document written by TraderSeven for the original Firebird EA. Note that it was written for a MUCH OLDER version of Firebird.

Most of the firebird EAs in this forum does not perform averaging for those losing open positions.   
  
I understand from the document is that the EA should modify the TP and SL for those open positions for any new position purchased. Could this be the reason for the large draw down ?  
  
Just wonder are all these EAs consider a true firebird EA ??

Thank you for pointing out the post wher I could find the document - I can now see the graphs!. Will remember that it describes an older version

Today, January 15, 2007, cable again is ranging and FireBird is working fine. This is the fourth time. Until I see different, I'm of the opinion that cable's performance is a good signal (perhaps one of many) as to whether it's safer to run the Bird.

Currently I have 2 open orders using Firebird v.63 (with a few mod of mine in the code). The weird thing is that one order is a sell, and one is a buy. Which I do not think FB does on its own, I thought it goes only one direction, long or short, until the trade(s) are closed. They only think I can think of is that I adjusted the settings before the second order was placed. I increased the risk percentage. Am I correct in thinking that every time you adjust the settings, it restarts the EA?? If this is the case, should we fix FB so that when it starts up it scans the open orders to check if it has open orders, and what direction? Wouldn't this code be placed in the 

Inserted Code
    
    
    int init() {

portion of the EA?? Just wondering.

I just finished the whole thread and I have one question:  
  
What is the difference of changing the TF in MetaTrader from changing it in the settings of FB3.2.  
  
Thanks for any replies.

In my opinion:  
  
EA's are trading tools. Firebird is a great tool for a specific set of market conditions. I wouldn't use a wrench to hammer a nail... I increased my live account 50% with this tool, and I held on to my gains. Not bragging... I'm sure many traders did better with it than I did, but they're probably tired of hearing the same old complaints after repeated warnings. Anyone who studies this thread will see that it is rife with cautionary posts about the fact that this EA is not for inexperienced traders. Does that make it a "bad" program? No.   
  
In fact, I don't believe new traders should waste their time with EA's at all for at least the first year or two. All the same rules apply to profitable manual trading. Learn to trade manually (and profitably) before working on anything like this. Retail Forex vendors don't provide Metatrader with it's automated trading capabilities because they think it will make traders more money. Going back to the tool analogy... if someone hasn't learned to effectively use a hand saw yet, then they'll make a bloody mess with a power saw.

What do you think about using it as an indicator, basically, in a ranging market, manually executing the orders that it takes on a demo from the same data feed? I've been considering it, since I've seen how successful it can be in a ranging market where trend reversal methods don't work...

I haven't tried it, but I bet it's worth a try. I think my primary concern would be getting "overloaded" with trade signals. This can be a busy little EA! But for an experienced trader, that's probably the best filter of all.

On the 10th of December I decided to start using Firebird 3.2 in a $200 account. From my perspective, after some demo testing I considered that EURUSD and USDCHF were the best performing pairs, so I let run this baby 24 hs. a day in my little account. Today my account balance is more than $1000, an equity almost the same.  
I want to say thanks to Wackena for this excellent version of Firebird (and also TraderSeven), which is think is the most stable and well performing of all. You have my admiration and gratitude for your disinterested effort and help. Keep up the good work!  
Below I atatch my account history.  
  
Best wishes!

Hi, this may be a silly question, but I downloaded the Firebird 3.2, compiled it and tried to backtest. But, I don´t get any signals! Is there som adjustment I´ve missed?

I left the settings as they were, I just compiled it and placed it in Experts. It doesn´t produce any signals on GBPUSD or EURUSD, the ones I usually try.  
  
Default setting is 0.1 lots.

I tried a combination of different versions for the last 4 weeks, I got 60% profit. awesome!!!!!  
The most aggressive is the original version V63g. which produced the higher return but sometimes seems out of control.   
The only pair that went negative was GBP/USD twice (I cut losses to 100 pip each, but could have run to 200 pips loss which would have hurt my acc harder) This pair was dropped for next week.   
In addition, when I saw a couple of trades stacked from one day to the other I cut it to allow the program to start another trade and avoid the waste of time.   
I am working V63-TS on EUR/USD and USD/CHF for this week starting today, not a signal so far...  
I think this EA works great but requires a close vigilance and active participation to be alert to cut excessive losses if you consider the market is trending to the wrong side (based on the news or other indicators) or to release stacked trades, I consider better to accept a small loss and enter a new trade than being involved on the same trade all the week blocking the way to a potential profitable trade (but this depends on every trading style)   
  
Hope this helps someone.   
  
Thanks to each and every participant in this thread for your disinterested collaboration and help.

I agreee 100% with you on that. V63-TS is a great little EA, but it does need supervision. It has poor open trade management. There have been attempts, by others, to impliment some sort of trade management that would close lossing trades if they were x days old, and too far into the wrong side. Firebird has a routein that averages the take profit level when it opens more then one trade. This is so that when the price retraces a little all the open trades close at once, then FB can open a new set of trades. I haven't seen this implimented yet, so I am not sure it is profitable, or if it even works. I have looked at it, but I am not up to the programing task.

Has anyone come up with any good ideas for hedging Firebird's trades? For those times when Firebird gets away on a strong trend, I'd like to enter an opposing trade. Just not sure where to enter it and when to take profit. Woud it be better to take it on the first entry, or wait for the first pipstep and tp on the next pipstep. Any ideas? I know there is one version of FB somewhere that included hedging, but not sure of the logic behind it. If anyone knows, please share. Thx.

Firebird 3.2 includes hedging, but I don´t know the exact logic. At first I couldn´t get any signals from it, but I came across a set-file and it then worked in backtest. Unfortunately it doesn´t seem to work in forward test.

Yes, Firebird 3.2 includes hedging. To know the logics, just read the comments inside the code when you open de .mq4 file with the MetaEditor.  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    UseHedge = true;  // Places reverse order with PipStep order.
    HedgeLotFactor = 1;     // Hedge order Lots will be increase by this factor.
    HedgeTakeProfit= 30;
    HedgeStoploss = 100;

In your experience, what time frame has produced the best overall results with v.3.2? I understand that EA makes more trades on shorter time frame but more trades is'nt always better. I'm doing a backtest for 2006 EUR/USD on a 1Hr. chart and account is up 5% through Jan. 20th. Also ,what are your guidlines on adjusting the float percent during a trade. Should the float percent be left at 30% or changed during a trade to protect gains ? Thank you Wakena for this fantastic looking EA.

The last version that I coded is Firebird 3.2 and is attached. Other versions are located here.  
<http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/>  
  
I've found out the hard way that Firebird (any version) will lose money if not manually controlled when needed. FB is a reverse trend EA in that it waits till price reaches either upper band and enters sell order or lower band to enter buy order. The concept is that the price will eventually reverse to take profit. Before it reverses, PipStep orders will be placed while price continues to move up (Sell PipStep orders) or down (Buy PipStep orders). If the trend continues, the 300 pips Stoploss gives possibility of many PipStep orders. This can lead to high DrawDowns. You much decide if trend is worth staying in or manually close order/s for small lost. Also, in most instances, the price never reverses enough to close all orders in profit. So you much also decide when to close a long term open order.   
  
This is experience only, no set rules. If you can learn when to stay in and when to get out, this EA can make profits as I have run 3.2 in profit for several months.  
  
The hedge function places both Buy and Sell orders when PipStep order is called. I've found this improves profits, but will also have more occurrences where manually intervention is needed.  
  
The MA_timeframe=15 and I have not changed this. On M5 chart selection, you will have more orders and higher DrawDowns. Lately I use M30 chart selection and it seems to slow down number of trades and reduced high DrawDowns. I think M30 predicts trends better.  
  
The EquityProtection feature in 3.2 is not the best code. Setting the Float Percent correctly needs to be constantly changed in relation to Account Balance, and so, I don't use it.

Could you tell me what time frame you were trading your $200 real money account on ? I'm guessing it was the 5min.chart. Are you still trading this account and how is it doing? Thanks

Hey guys look at this account statement, this is an Real Investment Company account statement performance. I guess they are using firebird, but i have no idea which version and settings they are using.   
Does any one can help to take a look of what they are using, because i think if we can get to know what they are using its gonna be great.   
This is a real investment company that have thousands of retail investor, i think they manage around $100.000. I think they wont be stupid enough to open a company and their ea doesn't work well, so guys check it out!.

Hi,  
  
I think they are using Multilots EA or DLMv EA which can produce high return in ranging markets but also huge drawdown when the trend is strong.  
See the following link

To determine entry points they may use any EA which exist, because statment result has pure Martingale money management system.

I am currently running this in a demo account $10,000 1:100 (similar to what I would open, after some more demo, micro, mini) on the 6 major pairs it is + $1,962.67 as I am writing this it has traded all the pairs throughout the week. It did not take one losing trade so far. Of course I would expect it to do so. I am prepared for that happening. My question is this-there is one trade open that it neglected to modify order and place a trailing stop like all the other trades.....is that somewhat common? If it hits the initial hard stop it will take back half the profit. Any input\suggestions always appreciated.

for the first statement, $106 for a $1000 balance in two weeks, is not quite impressive;  
  
for the second one, i don't really get, it how can it be: $6 profit out of 15 pips @0.04lot trade![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)

After considering this a little more carefully I am reasonably new to trading. I (attempted to on paper for some months but gave up) and only recently decided to stick my big toe back in the pool. Seems the EA actually placed the modified order to move the stop to break even and for some reason the broker didn't accept the request, is this common with EA's and brokers? Or is it just a demo thang? If that were not the case the account would be up to around $2200

I just discovered the Firebird thread - yeah I have been out of it for a long time, but trying to get back into self trading forex.  
  
I read on the previous to last page that the author of the EA believes it will eventually lose without manual intervention, which is fine as I am not looking to fully automate trading. The question is what version of the EA is recommended to use and who has some of the latest forward testing results?  
  
Cheers

I have demo tested many variations of firebird as im sure many have, the only version that did well for me was the original 63G version, but watch the market and turn it off as soon as you think its trending otherwise you're gonna have a massive drawdown even if it doesnt wipe you out.

Thank you for the reply Raven. I am very far from an expert, but I understand that Osciliator signals (Stochastics for example) are used to identify pivot points and they signal when a trend is about to change or end. Whereas trending indicators are reactive and slightly delayed in identifying the end or change in a trend, Oscilitator signals can be used to "predict" and be proactive. I will have to take a look at the firebird EA and indicators. Maybe adding an indicator or two will help in determining when the trend is over.  
  
Cheers

Hi,  
  
Do you want some more action? try V63g original version...and fasten your seat belt...  
but please be cautious, it can give you great returns, but in a matter of hours it can blow out your account also...  
I posted my conclusion on FB...see post 1955...  
  
Hope this helps...

Hello firebirders,  
  
I had just finished to read some threads about firebird, here in forex factory and at forex-tsd, where many people from here also post messages and contribute for our EA.  
  
I was working in firebird since 04/2006 alone (just with a friend of mine). A month ago we decided to look at the firebird community's work. We are very happy about so good work we found here. Congratulations people.  
  
About the development of the EA and the tests done untill now we consider that there is a divergence compared with our work. Since fiorebird is conter-trend strategy, we think that is just possible to talk about trend in a 1 hour (60M) timeframe.  
  
We have much more to share with the community, but let's by step-by-step. We would like to hear you about the timeframe divergence.  
  
One last statemente: the post 1506 is simply amazing, but it was not commented by the community. We would like to ask you to consider that again.

Well, the post #1506 by ptangbizkit really contained great ideas. Here is the post quoted:

> Wakena, skyline, MM, I'd like your opinions before I go ahead and program a TRAILING ENTRY into 63G TS. The idea is that birdy would set its original place for entry, start a trailing count from there, if price continues rising, it doesnt place an order, it doesnt place the order until price has stopped rising and retraced, a buffer of 5-8pips should work sufficiently from what i have seen so far. I hope I have gotten the idea across, the other good thing is that with divergence protection on, if price continued on its way up, divergence would stop a potential order in a trend onset.

My opinion:  
1, Yes, it would be quite a useful idea.  
2, Probably 63G TS or 65tf.  
3, Both the delayed (trailing) entry and divergence protection idea are great.  
  
I can imagine that ptangbizkit has already implemented his ideas...

The concept is that the price will eventually reverse to take profit.

I'm using this version but all of a sudden yesterday it placed two orders of 1.28 lots. I have the EA set for 0.01 lots. Something I've set wrong? Also how is v0.65 doing for you guys? Not to good for me. What are the best settings?  
Thanks

Hi Wackena,  
thanks for your EA. I'm testing it and made about 450 pips in one week. I open the platform at 08:00 CET and make the EA running until 21:00 CET without closing any position. I use 30 minute charts. So,the only problem is that we should close some positions wich could give us large losses?so, we should use our discretion?

Just keep running it.  
  
You'll see. Hope you are using very small lots.

My advice would be: Don't trade with Firebird.

Just when you're all comfortable trading Firebird, he will reach around and grab your wallet when you least suspect it. Many have been burned by Firebird.

What does the Float percent and Loss level do/mean? FBv3.2  
  
Can someone PLEASE explain to me how the SL works with this? I have it set with a SL of 15pips but it did a trade and SL went to 140 pips. I don't know why the EA didn't close the trade at 15 pips SL ????

In Firebird 3.2 if I have MaxTrades=1 will it still allow the Hedge order to place? If it doesn't and I set Maxtrades=2 it might open two initial trades then Hedge still won't open when needed. Is it easy to code to have the Hedge still open if I have Maxtrades=1?  
Thanks

Hi Matrixebiz  
  
I'm testing it but only for 2 days now, so far looks good. I see a lot of people says that it looks good for some time and then it wipes the account. I can see how this can be possible but I tend to manually close trades when I deem necessary to protect my capital. I will see how it goes. I do not worry too much about the EA having bad days as this happens in manual trading as well, but it is amazing to see this EA perform. I'm not an expert at all on Firebird and try to stick to the default settings. Hope this helps. I wonder if there are people trading this EA successfully on a live account. It might be inspirational if they can maybe give advice if such a person exists.

I am trading live with it and still seems good. Wins 8 of 10 times. What version are you using?  
It does make money and as long as you set MaxTrades like 4 it can't blow your account trading 0.01 lots. I am winning this week except Ausie is loosing for me this week.

I'm using V1.0a, V3.2 and V1.0c. I'm testing each one on a separate demo account. I agree with AUD loosing so far, but I have a system in place of watching the trades. After the trend has started to reverse I check for TP levels being more that the 0.618 fibo retracement level and then move all the TP levels to the 0.618 fibo level. I don't know if this will work, but I do this as I saw somewhere in the forum that people said that one has to manually intervene.

I noticed that all other Firebird versions except v3.2 has this comment for SL;  
Stoploss = 300;// **total loss on all open positions in pip** s  
  
Firebird v3.2 just has Stoploss = 300  
  
I haven't noticed v3.2 close out all positions all at once if that's what that means ?? It just sets a SL and TP for each individual trade.  
  
Was the code changed in v3.2? I noticed that Trailing Stop and Hedge doesn't seem to work all that well either in v3.2. I haven't needed it but I've seen it do it and seen it not do it when the trade is loosing.

I have also been forward testing last 2 weeks using IBFX and have only had one loss on the GBP/JPY. But have since removed that pair and have had zero losses. This EA still seem to be a winner except in a heavy trend. The GBP/USD I am also forward testing and is becoming a bit of a concern. Not sure if a trend is developing, because my largest negative trades open as of today remain in that pair...hmm I guess we'll see. Still only halfway through reading this entire thread but have learned alot since starting Firebird in the last 2 weeks.

I dont' think there is one single person who runs this thing live over long period that is successful, I could be wrong tho, anyone out there, I wish it worked long term without taking on and off, but I think it might be to much to ask of it.

This EA still seem to be a winner except in a heavy trend. The GBP/USD I am also forward testing and is becoming a bit of a concern. Not sure if a trend is developing, because my largest negative trades open as of today remain in that pair...hmm I guess we'll see. Still only halfway through reading this entire thread but have learned alot since starting Firebird in the last 2 weeks.

Hello jkdon,   
  
I am using version 63G-TS. I'll need to get back to you as far as the settings go but I did get the settings provided on a previous post. While reading this thread i've been taking notes and I can tell you that Accrete offered a link to an invaluable resource dedicated to the Firebird EA on post# 228. Im not sure how much of this thread you have read, but I strongly recommend going back and reading as much as possible from the beginning of the thread. You will learn almost everything within the first 500 posts. Or atleast enough to choose which version suits you. I personally like the trailing stop function that is in the 63G-TS Version. I hope this helps, Take care.

You can include the set files using the manage attachments button below the text entry window when making a post. Since you can't attach the *.set extension you can either change the extension to *.txt or place the *.set file in a zip file. The *.txt file is confusing to some people so be sure to point out they need to change the extension back to *.set in order to use it in the preset directory.

Hi jkdon,  
there's a live forward test performed by Newdigital in private section of another forex forum and usdchf performed more than 40000 pips starting from jan 2006 since today using original v0.65 :  
  
**1\. Firebird v0.65 with 42633 pips. (since January 2006)**  
  
Even if the result could be impressive there was a starting 4000 pips drawdown on jan/feb 2006 !!! This clear out that _Firebird EA is really dangerous because the drawdown sooner or later will eat all your account/profit in no time_.  
I replied above statement everytime people ask me by pm/email about Firebird.  
  
Just forget it and move on...

vtecbesaq it's only a question of time, you will lose everything using this EA.   
Do a favour to your hard earned money, don't use Firebird EA in a real account. I learned this on my skin and I was lucky very lucky because I exited just before it burned all my real account. Backtest means nothing.

Thanks skyline for the useful information.  
I think the most important thing for those newbies who wants to try firebird is to know that "THERE IS NO MONEY MANAGEMENT BUILD INTO FIREBIRD" and I think that's the killer. People play big with firebird in the hope to make massive money (but they most likely lost the account).  
Take example that you only want to try one pair USD/CHF and get those 40000+PIPs over last 1 and half year, what's the money management you should use?  
The drawdown is 4000PIPs, so to be safe, we double it to 8000PIPs that the pips you need to survive the drawdown. Then say your maximum tolerance risk for your account is 20% drawdown. If you have US$10000 on "mini" account, then you can only risk $2000 total for that 8000PIPS - that translate to 0.25 lot per trade. Then those 40000 PIPs profit would translate $10000 profit over last 1 1/2 years which is pretty good. It is just not matching the "NEWBIE'S EXPECTATION"~~  
Then it is the question of "diversification" - people expected that diversification is good and think it can "minimise" the drawdown. However it is not true for firebird~~ The drawdown are more severe with diversification and believe me it eats all your profit before you ever noticed it. Therefore if you really want to diversify, you need to reduce the trade size further.  
  
By the way, the backtesting using firebird gives totally different result to the live trade so don't backtest it and think you got the holy grail.  
  
Hope it helps everyone.

I totally agree with Skyline.  
  
I also traded this EA live . You can see my results earlier in this thread. My risk per trade was 3% and the EA gave great results for several months. Then I lost most of my account in a few weeks during a strong trend. I nearly lost the lot but manually bailed out with 50% or my starting balance. before this period i was up 70%. So starting with a $1,000 account I ran it up to $1,700, then lost $1,200 in a few weeks. Not good.  
  
Do not be decieved by good results for a period of time. 30 pips profits with 300 pip losses will nuke your account sooner or later.   
  
I actually tested this EA with great results for a few months then went live thinking I was now on "easy street". trading this EA went against all that i had come to believe about a good system - but the results were great so it must be good. Certainly this EA give periods with great results but the inevitable losses will wipe you out.  
  
I have attatched my statement as proof. Please refer to the first half of the atatched graph. This is not my only trading account. I mostly use this one for testing, but it's clear that this EA has some serious problems.   
  
Learn to trade properly. Do not waste your time and money with this EA. If you want to trade EAs find one with better stats. personally i would rather learn to trade the "hard" way.  
  
I gave up on EAs after this one, and am slowly rebuilding my account.  
  
There is no easy way. I have certainly learnt that lesson after 4 years of trading. The lessons I have learnt in that time cannot be taught in any other way.  
  
Please do not be deceived by EAs like this. I don;t know what else to say but I feel for people who get caught by in the trap of what at first appears to be "easy riches" only to lose everything in a matter of time.  
  
I am no expert but I am still here after 4 years trading live. So I must be doing something right ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

Kudos go to TraderSeven for his well thought out Expert. And without second guessing, where would we be as a people? Dwelling in caves, probably. So more thanks to the modifiers who have tried to offset the excentricities of the market and are making real progress.   
  
I learned some helpful things as I start to demo trade on my 10 IBFX platforms, now on Build 210.  
1\. Do not trade GBP/USD.  
2\. OK to trade GBP/USD.  
3\. Do not trade any of the JPY pairs.  
4\. OK to trade the JPY pairs.  
5\. Firebird will steal all your money and your self-respect.  
6\. Stick with Firebird and you will do well and be admired.  
7\. Never interfere with an Expert or it will not work right.  
8\. You had better supervise the animal or you know what!  
9\. Do not quit your day job, newbie.  
10.Do not quit your day job, Senior Member.  
11.Be sure to include the entire quote of the post you are replying to so the thread can set a new record for length and redundancy. (Is there an Opthalmologist on the Forum?)  
12.Do not go to the [www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird) resource for all versions of Firebird, lest you miss out on making new friends on the forum by asking lazy-boy questions.  
13.Once on the **accrete** site, do not read the FireBird Manual, version 0.27, or you will appear too smart and shame your fellow posters.  
14.Be sure to ask others what parameters they are using so you can blame your poor results on someone else.  
15.Forward testing is for dummies, avoid it if possible.  
16.Do not spend any more time than absolutely necessary in your quest to be the new George Soros. It is inevitable.  
17.Pray non-stop to your personal divinity, but please, do it privately. This is not the opening kickoff of an NFL game.  
18.Do respect those who patiently help you. Do your own homework before asking "Do you have an Expert Advisor that can make me rich?"  
19.Do continue to post your results in terms of money rather than in PIPS, so it will disguise your results and make others add even more posts to the Forum trying to find what it is that you really did.  
20.Please realize that FOREX for individuals is the greatest opportunity you will ever have in your, hopefully, long and happy life. Respect it and take it seriously. Dude.

Hi all  
I am currently using Firebird v63H04-TS and I'm wondering if it is possible to amend the EA so that it sounds an audible alert when the EA places the trade? Thanks all!

Open EA in MetaEditor. Find this section and add changes below in Red. You can use any sound .wav file that is in the Sounds folder or find .wav file on internet or make a new .wav file and add to Sounds folder.

Having tested v1.0a, I would have to say it was luck based on the market conditions. Be very careful. In a ranging market you will take profit on a few trades every day with almost no loses. The float will get large but will not be a problem because the larger the float the more you gain on a retracement. Then if the market starts trending a bunch of open trades will hit the SL. Look carefully at your float and count the possible loss if the market trends strongly. I would not recommend trading with real money. As far as trade size goes it would depend somewhat on how many pairs you trade and what you have the EA's parameters set to. I would test at .1 lots if you are trading a number of pairs.

i've noticed that programmers are often judgmental and much too serious. must be all that black and white binary code.  
  
but you guys Do have a point. i just did not realize that i had such _wonderful_ fans that read _everything_ i post on _every_ thread. wow! do you have an EA for that? do you ever turn off your computer?   
  
so no more dumb humor. i need to get serious like greenspan and bernanke and you guys.   
  
since i've now accomplished my 15 post goal with your help (thanks guys), i can now pm you direct with my serious insights, _which you_ _can use_ _as trade advice_!  
  
i am predicting the low of the year on the s&p right around december 10th. watch citi tomorrow, nov 20th. if it breaks 31 it will go to 25 and take the market with it. then a rally for the rest of the week prior to a collapse into december.

good one skyline, but i am not funny like eddie murphy anymore. i am a serious guy. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) with serious predictions. i predict a us bear market for the next 9 months with 25% off the high. look for a big bankruptcy in early december, maybe freddie, fannie, countrywide, or washington mutual.  
  
yesterday's rally was engineered by fidelity getting into low-beta exxon after selling off their other holdings. and since the spider puts are getting crushed, expect a rally in the index names on friday.  
  
right??

SuperNova used with a reasonable reward:risk ratio could be a good EA.   
Firebird is a really dangerous one and it should be used only on demo account!   
Oh btw I'm not using any of them in my live trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Because I experienced that on my skin ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Btw I'm not the repository of the Truth , try it in your live account for at least 6 month then come back here and tell me how it performed using 300 pips stoploss and 30 pips takeprofit ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)

I will be continuing my demo of it until the end of January with my settings...if my results remain consistent as they have been for the last 3 months I will be going live with it  
  
using a stoploss of 300 with a take profit of 30 IS suicide with firebird....that much I will agree with you without testing it on those settings  
  
I will keep you posted

OK, coming back to this...  
  
Has anyone been able to get this EA to correctly use the subroutine that averages your open orders, then recalculates the stop loss and take profit points?

I work with all the firebirds versions for almost a year. Firebird 63g original version is the best. I open a live account with $500 and in 5 days i have $932, no losses. The key with firebird is not be "greedy". I work with GBP/USD and USD/CAD in a 5 minutes chart. tp=26, sl=300, pipstep=30. Never work with USD/JPY. EUR/USD have big downdraws. Just open a maximun of two pairs and you will be alright. If you open four, five or six pairs at the same time your account will be destroy. Remember this is a reverse EA you will begin the trade losing points. Don"t be greed. Look at me. $432 in 5 days. Not bad.

I tested in demo all the firebird versions (1.0a, 1.0b, 1.0c, 63g, 3.2, etc...), one month per version.. Firebird 63g was the best. Small downdraws,won 53 trades, no losses. I don't espect that in my live account, but until now i like what i see. I trade 0.5 lots, now that i have almost $1,000 i will trade 0.7 lots. When I have $1,500 i will trade 1.0 lots.  
Take profit=26  
stoploss=300  
pipstep=30  
MA_timeframe = 30

Yeah, $1000 can become $60 a lot quicker then you think. (don't ask how I know ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ) Watch out for the trend, it will ground a Firebird quickly. A while back I used it, and 63g was the better. At least I thought so. Haven't used it in a while. It works great in a ranging market, but you will lose your shirt if it hits a trend. Eventually it recovers, but not unless you have very deep pockets. Trading 1.0 Lots (mini) with $1500 is still too much!

I'm sad for you losses Rusty , this is why I'm thinking to ask moderator to close this thread because newcomers jump in and still don't understand how much Firebird could be very very dangerous for their account. I was lucky because I did quit it before my account was cleared by Firebird, so finally I did exit with few gains.

Thanks for the advice guys,i will stay with 0.5 lots. It works good til today. i Have $986.80 I will make a withdrawal today of $500 to recover my inversion. From this point i have nothing to lose. If i lose a trade (300pips) i will stop trading with that pair until stabilize again.

I think this is a great EA if you would constantly withdraw your profits and let the Marginal Call become your stop loss .... With proper profit management, you can make some serious $$$ ...

Don't be too sad, Most of that was gains from Firebird ! It needs a strong hand to tame it, I wouldn't give up, but maybe refine it from the ground up. i have been working on it on and off. but NOTHING ready for the public. Just something gto do in spare time

I believe that 99% of all Ea's created will blow the account lolz , that's why my trust and use of ea's = 0  
  
I never used an EA before, i still prefer to manually trade, but hey if it works why not give it a shot, maybe allow it to trade using 1% of my account per trade.

I use 7 ea's in my two live accounts to make a very well rounded portfolio. I have not had a losing month yet by doing this. There are some terrific ea's. Now is every ea profitable every month no, they are not. Except one that I know of but for the rest of the ea's that is why I run a portfolio of them and it works for me.

Hello,  
  
The ea's that I use are commercial ea's and a couple of ea's from a private forum. FF will not allow me to mention these. For those people that are sending me a private message. Unfortunately, I do not reply to private messages. All I can say is keep a look out on different forex websites and you will see some good reviews of a few profitable commerical ea's.

Jeff

No worries. Can you run multiple EAs on the same account? If so, how would one do that?

Hi,  
  
I have used the Firebird EA v1.0c with great results. I used the original settings in the first post, with TF 1M on E/U.   
  
I gone through several posts in this thread and it seems that many traders prefer the original 63g version better than other versions. Didn't this version have problems such as multiple orders?  
  
Traders also seem to prefer G/U and USD/CAD with other timeframes than 1M. Some mention that U/J is good as well, but others say that the JPY-pairs doesn't work well.  
  
It would be interesting to know what versions of the EA that people prefer, on which pairs and timeframes? It would also be nice to know how profitable this EA has been for traders in this thread?  
  
This can be a very profitable EA, but it is aggressive, so it would be nice to hear different opinions of how to tweak the settings. Hopefully we can all learn from each other and earn some extra pips!  
  
Happy trading!  
  
Archie

I did the following change in the Settings   
  
Fast EMA original 18 changed to 5  
  
Slow EMA original 24 Changed to 10  
DivergenceLimit .0002 changed to .0005  
  
The above changes are made duing my back testing process and I have found the number of loss has reduced after the change in the settings  
  
My other observations are  
  
Avoid EA during news time  
Avoid EA during market change over like Japan to UK& Europe ad the last part  
of US market

I used this EA in the early days, with some degree of sucess however it only works in a ranging market and will blow your account in a trending market.  
I thought this thread had been closed.  
  
All I can say is move on, dont waste your time with it...

The key with firebird is not be "greedy". I work with GBP/USD and USD/CAD in a 5 minutes chart. tp=26, sl=300, pipstep=30. Never work with USD/JPY. EUR/USD have big downdraws. Just open a maximun of two pairs and you will be alright. If you open four, five or six pairs at the same time your account will be destroy. Remember this is a reverse EA you will begin the trade losing points. Don"t be greed. Look at me. $432 in 5 days. Not bad.

How often does this EA trade? I'm running it v3.1 on EURUSD and USDJPY on M30 timeframe. I left it running overnight but no trades. It does fine in backtests, over 500 trades in a 1 month period on both pairs.  
  
It has the smiley face in the corner so I know its working

Hi guys,  
  
This is my first post on FF, although I’ve been lurking on FF forum for about a year, I see that this thread is freezing, so I just wanted to share my thought hoping for good feedbacks from all you guys. So here’s my thought,   
  
I’m busy doing my job since I’m an employee, so I wanted to have a minimum control of my chart, I just want a daily control, secondly there is no EA that works forever since the market is changing overtime so I have to “drive” the EA manually ( set the EA “Long only” or “Short only”), I’ll show you how.  
  
  
  
1. Put the EA on **5 Min chart**   
2. Put the template and indicator on your **daily chart**  
  
  
**How to start and “drive” the EA**  
1. See the trend on daily chart just like the pic below,  
2. When you see the trend down on daily chart, “Drive” the EA “Short only” on your 5 min chart, and vice versa  
3. When you see the trend is changing on daily chart then you have to “drive” your EA on 5 min chart accordingly  
  
  
Maybe theres a question, if you see the trend is clear so why you have to use this EA? My experience is that this EA can catch pips more than the market pip range , for example from January 1st Jan to January 7th the price move down for 500 pips, then this EA can catch more than 500 pips from the price retracement, just try this EA on back test for 1 month on Aug 2008 you will see that.  
  
  
Less stress because you don’t trade news and not sit in front of your computer for a long time, just check it once a day.  
  
  
I used GBPUSD and EURUSD or you can try another pair, just look for the pair that shows a clear trend in mid or long term  
  
Default setting for the EA is set to 5 digit broker platform, you can change it, and also the TP and pipstep as you feel comfort.  
  
  
I know there’s gotta be a negative side from this “EA drive” thing, I know some but I prefer to hear the feedback from you guys.  
  
  
English is not my default language, so…sory for my bad English.

sory hard to write on PDA,   
ok SL is 300 but it save as long as you go with the trend, the problem is when the trend is changing sometimes it still profit for the day, but when the price moves more then you might get minus for the day, but overall the loss still can covered by few days profit, for now I set TP to 100pips becouse the market moves in large range, the rest setting is default according to ea i attach, got 200 pips today till now. But dont try this in real acc before you understand everything bout this setting, try this for a month, you might get 1000 pips, happy to recieve feedback from you guys.

what do you mean for daily trend?  
daily trend is where u determine the trend, thats where u put the indicator and the template  
when you open MT the candle you see?  
i confirm the major trend first from the daily chart and then i move to 5min chart where i put the ea and then drive the ea according to the trend on the daily chart  
the candle of the day before?  
just see the arrow up or down confirmed by the color of the candle from the heiken ashi indicator, that where u see the major trend.  
And for day do you mean the day of the market you are workin with?  
yup

200 pips again for today, TP is 100 pips, for newbies just becarefull to use this setting, it might be dangerous.use money management according to your budget,use small percent of risk just incase drawdown happens in early live trading becoz that what was happens to me, blow my account twice, dettach your emotion is very important becoz u might get a differet result by checking your chart every hour, just check it one or two per day, but if u doubt so dont trade, thats the point of this setting, less stress right? dont think the money, just think it as number. demo it for minimum 1 month.  
  
  
just to let u know that its difficult to write on the pda in the midle of annual meeting and training with lots of job request from the boss.  
  
wish us all the good pips in this universe

This seems to work well for me SamuraiPower whenever I point in the direction of the trend.   
  
Great profits so far on my demo.   
  
I watch the COT reports and do some basic trend analysis to see if the pair is going in the direction I want and then I set the EA to only trade that direction and it works great ;P gratz on the Firebird EA and Indicator and thanks for your input SamuraiPower!

if u notice the plain candle u will see that the trend was about to change, and also confirm with the indicator,at that time its risky to trade, spescially when it moves more than 200pips against u, u might blow your account, just trade when the trend is clear, and trade just several days a week, u still can make 1000 pips a month, dont over trade. as i mentioned this setting is less stress, if u trade against the trade today then u will know how to use this setting. Btw the pair that i research is gbp usd, learn also the candle stick pattern, its very usefull to determine when the major trend is about to change.  
wish us all the good pips in this universe.

Thank you SamuraiPower, this is great....but ea opens many many positions, I have 20 opens at the moment, is this normal?? Can number of trades be limited??  
  
Tnx  
  
P.S. Nevermind....I was (am) playing around with ''pip step'' function and trying to understand it.

usually 20 open position at the same time is not normal, maybe u should check the setting for the pipstep.  
lets me show u this,the default setting for pipstep is 40 pips, then when u open buy position and then the market goes against u for -40pips, then the ea will open another buy position, it will do the same thing when it touch -80pips and so on. so check your pipstep and adjust it to your broker platform, the default is for 5 digit broker platform.   
so according to SL for 300 and pipstep is 40 then maximum open position at a time is 300 devide by 40 is 7 maximum open position at a time.

Yes...that was it, I was playing with it and set it for ''2pips'' LOL ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
I understand now... I guess price action will be needed here, to determine trend changes on daily.   
  
Thanks again Samurai and happy pippin mate![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Guys, I am trying to add this to my completely automated trading strategy, I.e I ONLY trade EA;s. I am after some feedback on the drawdowns required for this EA ?  
  
Cheers

Guys,  
I think there is no EA that will generate profit last forever since the market is changing overtime.  
  
"EA IS TO MAKE YOUR TRADE EASIER, NOT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER",   
so dont put all of your life on it.  
  
  
Here is my illustration,  
  
let say you set your EA to open position when the market form this condition  
  
(I ilustrate the market condition = sequence of numbers, just like below)  
  
5-4-6-8-9....   
  
when this sequence of numbers forms, the EA will open position and expected to be profit next, let say at this present this market condition generate 80% profit and 20% loss, and you happy  
  
but the market is changing soon or later, and this sequence of numbers no longer profitting, and you pee in your pants.  
  
I think the goal is how to make profit with minimum control and less stress,  
even the best strategy like 4H MACD from Phillip Nell is not 100% win, still need brain to manage money management, but with 70% probability of winning the trade.  
  
the basic of my firebird setting (see post 2090) is no different with 4H MACD P. Nell, you still need to:  
  
manage money management,  
look for a good entry setup condition,  
stay away from the unpredictable, market,   
and bla...bla...  
  
the only different is that there is one hard part from the trade that automated (so I use this EA), I say hard becouse I still pee on my pants when I open position and the market against me (can't control my emotion he...).  
  
so "DRIVE" the EA and enter the trade when the market shows a good entry setup, that's how to avoid a huge drawdown.  
  
any other suggestion? or any demo result to post?  
  
  
regards,  
SamuraiPower

Well I'll post then  
  
Just like I told you on post 2090 that this setting can catch more than the market range,   
  
in 4 days trading the market move down for 1243 points and I got 1296 pips till now, it means that this setting dont waste the momentum  
  
I'll show u the detailed statement, see th aattachment  
  
Note: this result is the perfect condition for the setting.

hello [SamuraiPower](http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=74031),  
  
I have been testing this EA recently and had a question. When you see the daily trend change do you let the current trades that are in play ride out or do you close all trades even though they maybe negative and then drive the EA in the correct direction?  
  
Kind Regards  
Justin

HI jdogg4000,  
  
It depends to the market,I usually look for the daily candle pattern as my other indicator, but when the market is about to change I close all the opening position of course. This is what I do when I notice that the market is about to change:  
  
1\. Safe way, not trade when the market is in the midle of changing direction, and continue to ride the market when the trend is clear, this avoiding drawdown, just take 7 days trading in a month and you probably got 1000pips. Strongly recomended to use this way.  
  
2 Still trading when the market is about to change, I use this just to confirm when the market is about to changing, when I see the frofit for the day less than 100 pips or even negative (but often still profit but minimum) that means I have to Drive the EA accordingly. But I dont recomend this, I only use this way on the demo.  
  
Hope that help jdogg4000

Important thing u have to know guys  
Maybe there is a question why do you have to use 300pips for the stoploss?  
  
from what I know that it is still save as long as u still follow the daily trend, when it's negative dont worry becouse the market will recover it (as long as u follow the daily trend), its normal to have negative open position becouse this EA will open the position on retracment. Let me show u  
  
Lets say the daily trend pointing to move down , but the price dont moves smoothly down right"?,it retrace (against the daily trend for temporary), when it retrace the EA will open position, it means that it will be negative for a while but soon the market will recover your position to positive becouse you follow the major trend.

You're trading only short or long based on the trend. There's lots of indicators that will tell you what the trend is. My biggest question on trend trading is how do you know when the trend will end, and how much of a loss will you incure with this ea if the trend reverses? What method(s) do you use to determine if the trend will continue, and what session do you enter at? Finally, can this trade at smaller amounts, such as 10 cents, 20 cents?

I have been toying with this since Samurai's Post and this EA does seem to work really well when trading with the daily trend.  
I have been trading (on a demo of course)  
TP: 200   
SL: 200   
PipStep: 50   
  
The EA is able to make quite a few trades and maybe fails once or twice at the end of the trend (So Far).   
When the trend changes quickly against me I am usually able to get out before any trades or executed or at a small loss.  
  
An idea that I have been toying with is closing all trades on that particular trend after I make 500 Pips. Takes me out of the market early so I don't have to worry about the bounce at the bottom but means I could miss out on a lot of pips if the trend continues for awhile.   
  
Anyways it was a great point to make. Thanks again SamuraiPower!!

Hi Paradoxical,  
  
well one thing for sure I dont know when the trend is change otherwise im a pipslionare by now, im sure u know better than me to recognize it, me myself only using the indicator i attach on post 2090 and candle pattern, I like simplicity.  
how much loss incure when trend changing? well my answer is big enough if the market change to the opposite direction suddenly more than 200 pips, so i strongly recomended not to trade when the market is changing, continue to ride when the trend is clear, im not gonna stop saying that. I think what maxss280 says is definitely correct, just get out the market early when u feel doubt about trend direction even if u miss lots of pips then, much better than enter the market and then loss, knowing when to stay out the market is one of trading skill right?  
i control my chart once a day, usually after new daily candle shows, so i can analyze the yesterday daily candle.  
i dont know if this EA can use the unit in cent, never try that, but u can explore it by yourself.  
i think maxss280 knows really well bout this setting already, thanks for sharing your idea. Maybe you can help me answering question since its hard for me to find a correct focabulary coz english is not my default language. SL 200 TP 200 is quite interesting setup maxss280.  
Btw I got another few hundreed pips for total 2500 pips from 16 Jan (9 days trading). cant post u the detailed statement since i write this from pda. ill attach it as soon as i can.

Samurai Power

Hi Samuri, First, the zip file was missing the second part of the EA. I really would like to see how it works. There's another EA I've tried by a guy named nanningbob who has a thread here called Trading the AUD/NZD successfully that will buy and sell and take profit every 30 pips, or how many ever you want to set it. He has made other EAs that can be used on other pairs that will buy or sell every 60, 90 or 100 with the subsequent trades increasing in lot size by whatevre you want. Without reading the whole thread (I know I should), it seems this EA is a lot like it, except you are using it only for either a long or short position based on your reading of what the daily trend is. But, isn't the issue the RETRACE and not the trend? Let's say you buy or sell the EURO, because your chart says it's trending long and it steadily climbs up 300 points, and the biggest retrace was 25 pips in that whole move. You already have several positions at increasing lot sizes, so you really can't buy anymore. Because the pair is now 125 PIPS above your last trade, you need a retrace of 80 PIPS to close all trades either even or in profit. What if it never does? What if it just keeps trending up another 400 points? That's my main concern.

I saw your statement mate..., zero drawdown??, zero losses, 100% wins...  
Sounds like a ''magic''.   
I guess it really needs all the skills to determine when trend turns other way, close all moment negative trades (as low as possible), wait for trend to establishe and drive again EA on that way.   
I still use 4H TF, to se whats happening...only daily is not enough.

hi paradoxical  
  
i dont know wether i get your point or not, but when the market move up or down smoothly or steady in a huge range (almost no retracement) then this Ea wont open position.  
  
For gasgas  
  
this is not magic, this is demo, in real trading the result might be different bcoz emotion will involved. No drawdown? not yet my friend, it is not statistic if i mention 9 days trading only, but the point is positive result in a month for at least 500 pips.   
i can see the trend clearly from the market character recently, i think it will be changing direction to move down in a large range in the next several days, that time it will be huge loss maybe about 400 pips if i dont drive the ea, but 9 days profit will cover it loss.  
Btw using 4h chart as your major trend is a good idea. I was using it but not continually since im busy and back to daily major trend. maybe it will work better for others.

I have read somewhere that this Expert is very good on ranging market, with your way we are trading big trends...And after big move many times it goes a little ranging. Do you think, after good move, could we change mabey on a lower TF and set Long&Short...Well for that time only to trend start moving one way again. Just thinking...

gasgas,  
  
yes ive tried that setting for a while and it seems still make profit, but the other way i use when the trend is changing is to set the SL and TF lower around 20 to 40 pips on the running position just to take the small profit and drive the ea again. btw that is a good point gasgas. this is not a fix setting, all of u can change the setting as u feel comfort but the point is that i informed u about the major idea, just try to share good thing here sincirely to have more pips in my life he...he....  
  
see post 2090 for the setting

I just came across this thread the other day, and see this EA has been around for awhile, and a lot of people were gung ho about it, and apparently got killed in a heavily trending market when the pair(s) just kept going up or down. There hasn't been much posting sine about September of last year.  
I've put it on 4 pairs just to see how it works. Samur, I admire your statements and that you've been able to get 100 pips consistently.  
  
On IBFX, the standard setting of.10 is ten cents. On a $3,000 account, that's good to start with. I like your idea of going with the current trend only. I suppose if you're in a trade such as the GBP, and the trend changes overnight, you can always just close that trade and go the other way. When I look back at the first post here, I see very low take profits and pipsteps. I gather someone decided those should be changed, because the v63 EA has default settings of MUCH higher pips.  
  
Does anyone know these were changed? Was it to eliminate too many trades?   
  
In future posts, I'll talk about an EA created by a guy named nanningbob that is very similar, and a new concept of opening trades at extremes when the pair exceeds it's 40 Moving Average by 80, 90, 100, 120 pips (whatever you want to set it at). This goes against the trend, and opens additional trades at whatever distance you want. It's the opposite of this EA. It's a counter trend EA.  
  
I don't see how people got busted using this EA. If you use a stop of 300 pips, you can simply calculate how much % of your account that is, and set the EA to trade only the amount of lots that would equal 2-3% of your account if you were stopped out.  
  
One of the threads nanningbob has posts on is "100X80 EA oh boy" for anyone that is interested.

Not sure what you did. Possibly didn't load the MQ4 file in your experts folder? This is the one posted on September 28. I made that mistake, too, and the EA didn't even appear on my experts folder until I loaded the MQ4 file.

Hi everyone  
  
1st all many thanks to those that have contributed to this post particulalry Samuraipower and others that are sharing their system with us and are trying to improve it for the benefit of this community.  
  
I would to ask people in this thread a question, yes I know yet another question and I am sorry if you have abswered it already. I have read the first few pages and the last few pages of this thread and have not found the answer to my question, so here it is.  
  
I have loaded the v 1.0c to my MT4 platform, I believe that I have loaded it correctly, I have a little <http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif> indicating that the sustem is working. I have left it overnight to test on a demo account and it does not appear to have made any trades, also there seems to be no indis in the chart etc.  
  
I have then gone back to the very first post for further instructions and couldn't find any, so I loaded the firebird indicator and I now have 2 MA lines but thats it, no indication of when a trade should be entered (manually or automatically.  
  
Sorry about the long winded question/explaination, but any assistance will be appreciated.  
  
Many thanks  
Ezzy

hi pradoxical,  
  
yes i saw many people trade this EA of course their blow they account bcoz they set long and short, in trending market one of the opening position either long or short will generate huge loss, and acctually my idea came from those statement, like i mention b4 "EA IS TO MAKE YOUR TRADE EASIER NOT MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER" so dont put your whole life in it, I call it driven EA and it still needs our brain to meke it succes, it is a semiautomatic EA not fully automatic, only part of trading is handled by this EA.  
im not a programer so yes i did change the EA a little bit but only the general setting like TP, SL just to make it as a default setting. Absolutely zero knowledge about programing.  
  
iopoipoi  
hi i saw u quite often on this thread, i see u very intrersting on it.  
ok maybe this can help.  
just put the indicator on the indicator folder  
put the expert on the expert folder,  
and restart your paltform.  
u have to know wether your broker is 4 or 5 digt platform.  
5 digit : value 10 means 1 pips  
4 digit : value 10 means 10 pips  
so set your TP and SL and pipstep accordingly.  
  
Hi Ezzy,  
My setting and the EA is in post 2090, just few pages from here, start read from there it will helps u a lot understanding this setting.  
  
just sharing my idea, u guys are my partner on this outside real worl, not trying to be your mentor coz there a lot of great profesional trader here, feel free to ask bout my idea.  
regars,

Was scalping yesterday late US session, and was killed on E/US, pair fall down for 130pips in few minutes. Saw the news today, and big thinks happening these days. I think is about global crisis and recession. So market could be very unstable and very volatil for a while.   
In daily E/U turn down again, I guess it was only retrace or news pushed thinks down. Gbp/US is in down trend from July last year, things must hit the bottom in some time.  
  
Samurai thanks for your contribution here...and for general idea that we can test and discuse....

Just out of interest, how many trades does it make per day on one currency.

thanks for your info  
finally i made it works  
  
it was better not however  
  
only losses  
deep losses  
  
  
The big problem I am finding is that it is hard for me to estebilish a trend  
  
last night on my daily chart e/d it was short  
this morning long  
  
Ho can you understand it is ranging on daily chart?  
From the MA?

hi junglelion,  
i think what makes your result amazing is becouse you backtest it on 4H TF. Btw thats not how to backtest this EA. please see post 2090 for the setting.  
  
  
Gasgas  
I really really really apreciate your comment, that makes my acc today from -200 to -400 and now end up with +500 pips, i understand why it goes like that.  
3100 pips total in 10 days trading. still cant attach my statement coz i write this on pda.  
  
  
Ezzy  
well it depends on the market behaviour, for my setting SL 300 and pipstep 40 maximum open position at a time is 7.  
  
iopoipoi  
hi i admire your effort to learn this. i think u are in the correct way of being pro trader, but one thing for sure the process might be hurt and might be long, so keep learning to senior trader to avoid the pain. thats what im doing also.  
  
KEEP REMEMBER THAT 95% TRADER FAIL, EMOTION PLAYS CRUSCIAL PART,EVEN THE BEST TRADING SYSTEM IN THE UNIVERSE WILL FAIL IF YOU CANT MANAGE EMOTION, PICK THE SIMPLEST TRADING SYSTEM FITS YOUR RYTHM AND MANAGE YOUR EMOTION THEN SUCCES IS IN YOU HAND.  
  
DETTACH YOUR EMOTION, THINK IT AS A NUMBER NOT MONEY

Hi all,  
  
Got 3100 pips in 10 days trading, it means 310 pips average/day.  
  
See the attachment below  
  
please analyzed each day profit, and compare it with the market range at the same day, you will notice that this driven ea setting can generate profit more than the market range.

So how do you know when Trend is Down or UP? Down when colour changes to Red and is above the yellow line? Up when colour changes to White and is below the yellow line? So you would wait until the bar closes to make sure the colour change sticks, correct? then open trade on the next bar  
  
What settings on the EA do you use? Are you manually opening the trade? What functionality is the EA providing?  
Thanks

Samurai Power,  
  
Thank you for your application for this expert.  
  
I have tested the ea using your settings following the daily trend as you suggested but I could not get the same results.  
  
For example on your statement a SELL ORDER is entered on Jan 16 at 02:26 but the trend is clearly LONG on H4 and daily charts, so how you did it ?  
  
Could you please explain in detail how to drive the expert in order to get positive results exactly as you got.  
  
Thank you.

No u didn't miss someting, remember its just only 10 days trading, lets analyze it and make a conclusion after 1 month ok, and continue to demo it (6 month) until we can say that the result of this setting is verify and validly profit.   
Please see post 2090, start to read from there to understand the setting.

HI matrixebiz and alfa99,  
  
I see the trend direction from the indicator I posted at post 2090, but also consider the candle pattern, when those indis is not in the line it means I have to becarefull. Just like yesterday daily candle it forms a spinning top candle, so that I know that maybe today the trend is reversing.   
  
Here is what I do when I start to assume that the major trend is running out of gas:  
Unload the EA and put SL and TP lower (20 - 40 pips) on opening position, or close all of the opening position even if its negative, and start to load the EA again according to the major trend when I see the major trend is clear.  
  
  
matrixebiz  
What settings on the EA do you use? Are you manually opening the trade? What functionality is the EA providing?  
Thanks   
  
  
for the setting see post 2090  
I dont manualy open the trade of course, thats the EA job description, our job is just to load the EA and drive the EA according to the trend when u see the major trend is clear.

Hi  
  
samer960**no trades**  
hi samurai   
i attach it en alpari demo and no trades since yesterday is that normal ? i left the settings as default didnt change anything   
regards   
  
if u adjust the EA with the broker platform already then sometimes its normal to have no trading in one day, but have u check this:  
  
1\. do u set the EA to "allow live trading"?   
2\. check the internet connection becoz the EA needs a very good up time internet connection.

Samurai Power,  
  
Thank you for your reply.  
  
I still don't understand why you set the ea on 16Jan at 2:26 on SELL when the D1 and H4 pattern bars were indicating for that time a clear BUY. I don't see nothing else indicated by any other indicator.   
Finally you did ok but I don't have clue how you did it.  
Am I missing something ?  
  
Thank you

Hi SamuraiPower,  
  
still trying the EA  
  
I think it is very good  
  
even on my account there are no trades since yesterday night  
  
quite strange  
  
yesterday during day few trades but good  
  
just the first were in loss,  
and touched the stop loss set on 200 pips  
  
  
the biggest difficult for me now is to understand the daily trend  
  
there is a precise time in the day you refer at for this reason?  
  
maybe the morning?  
  
I live in GMT + 1  
  
I thought the morning was no good,  
because euro session is just opened  
  
but with this time I took some good pips  
  
  
another things,  
  
in the EA you can choose the hours in which to trade  
if I put everything to 0 I see no stop?  
  
I tried, but not understand yet  
  
  
the last thing,  
why are you not using it on live account yet?  
You are having some great results it seems to me..  
  
  
thanks for all your efforts  
there are great potentials in this EA  
  
  
thanks

Hi Samurai   
  
Just a quick note to let you know and others that even though I have been trying it on demo since yesterday, this EA is working great!  
  
I left it on for a while yesterday and again for most of the day today......and I tell you what....it has given 5 from 5, 50 pip trades, how good is this!! I tried it once on my live account and got an easy 50 pips.  
  
I am worried about the 300 pip sl, so I will continue to demo to see at what conditions is it likely for the trade to go against you.  
  
Cheers   
Ezzy 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

I've been trying this EA also, and had it set for LONG on the EUR/USD and had trades opened. Then, the trend changed. The question is at what point do you close out these losing trades? Do you hold them & hope the trend will change back the next day? At what point do you look at the trend? New York session? Tokoyo? London? If you don't close out trades, and the trend reverses, you can have quite a few trades open that would each lose 300 PIPS. Haven't given up on this EA yet, though.  
Why is it used like it is where it opens additional trades, each subject to a 300 PIP loss? Has anyone ever tried it with 50 TP and a 150 Stop Loss? I think this is probably why people lost interest in this EA. The possibility and even PROBABILITY of huge losses when th etrend changes and you don't know whether the trend may come back to you, or not. In the meantime, you're stuck with trades that each hit a 300 PIP stop loss.

good question,  
  
this is the point  
  
it works very well when you catch the trend  
  
maybe some study about it is necessary  
  
  
maybe there are 2 times in a day to look at  
  
and check  
  
maybe it depends on the session  
  
for the eu session midday london time  
or 8.00 london time  
  
  
really don't know

Well I tried and tested with lower SL, and there were more looses though. I guess 300 pip stop should never be hit. Here still is needed price action reading or some good daily system to recognise change of a trend and to close all loosing positions as soon as possible so some profits from before are still kept. The thing is longer the trend, more profits we have, and more left when we loose some pips at trend change. ''HOPING'' is not an option, in forex anything is possible. We are in the global crisis and market might move very differently than past year. Hell I don't know, mabey market will trend very good, or we will have a lot of sideways moving...

Hi,  
Yes I guess u missing something, since I post my first post I became intensively demoing this again. When I start demoing again at 16 Jan I analyzed the market character from the history and conclude that the market will fall extreemly again in the next few days, confirmed by the daily candle pattern that up move is not strong and I assumed that if it still move up it will not be more than 300 piips, so I drive the EA short, I consider that this up move is a retracemnet and the EA will open many short position ( of course negative for a while) and soon my expectation is right.  
  
But of course this clear mind and brave decicion will not happens in real trading, maybe I'de rather wait till the trend establish and start to ride it.

Hi Samurai,  
  
I think you are right, it is needed some knowledge of the market for well understand were it is going..  
  
  
You delevelop a very good EA  
just it is a little difficul to understand the first direction  
  
do you think we could add some new indicator to the daily chart in order to better understand it?  
  
One thing still cannot clear identify is when you say:  
"maybe I'de rather wait till the trend establish and start to ride it."  
  
  
How can you determine this in one moment of the day or of the night?  
  
  
Once we can get this information, we have done almost the most part  
  
  
thanks again for all your work Samurai  
really really great

couldnt be more agree with u gasgas, 300 SL is to give space for the retracement, once I tried 200 but it hits sometimes even when it still strong trend in daily chart, but i think the point is just dont jump when u feel doubt, jump when the trend is clear, so the probability of winning the trade is high, and litlle chance for drawdown to happens.

Simple test, why I see potencial in this EA  
  
Start today at 7.00AM GMT+1 till now.(Eur/Usd)  
  
(EA trading)   
\- EA opens 4 positions and close all with 50pips TP. Together +200 pips  
  
Straith down, market went only 100pips from 7.00am, but EA catch twice that pips overall.  
  
So if we would open manually one position we would get half less pips.  
  
* But again *   
Tricky things is when to start and when to shut down EA. So to pause it or to change direction, I guess we may not rush into trading with it. There will be days, when it won't be safe trading, and we must be avare of that, and take a day off to spend money that Robot won for us![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

good point iopoipoi,  
Here is what I mean with clear trend   
  
_Clear down trend_  
when the chart turns red and the arrow pointing down and the candle pattern confirm it ( I suggest U to learn candle pattern, I got this suggestion from Phillip Nell with his great 4H MACD strategy), thats where the high probability of the next daily candle move down. if one of this indis is not in the line it means that u have to becareful, or much better not to trade, trade 7 days a month is enough to have "maybe" arround 1000pips.  
U can use your own indis as u feel comfort iopoipoi.

Personally i really like this EA due to the fact that it does work good in trending markets. I like to determine the trend for myself based on breaks of highs, lows, candle stick patterns, current events and other things. I also like the level of customization that any person can do with it for there own style of trading as well as different currency pairs. I have not driven this ea any direction the last few days because i am a bit unclear right now but early this week and last week i did manage to bank a few hundred pips on the EUR and GBP on my live and even more on my demo. Thanks Samurai for helping out.

Hi  
  
I'm fairly new to this forex game but I love Firebird and believe it's one of the all time Great EA's. I think you're really on to something with this "Drive the Trade BUT I don't see how to do it the way the EA is writen. Can you please explain how to do it.   
  
Thanks in advance.

I want to verify your EA setttings...  
  
I determine trend and only go long or short trades based on trend...no problem.  
  
You are using a 100p pip take profit, a 300 pip s/l and a 40 pip step, is that correct?  
  
Are you leaving all the other EA settings to default at this time?

I have the other kind of fire bird, but I ever got loss too  
I still use this EA with add manualy indikator in my chart I add Std Deviation  
and I just switch on this EA when Std Deviation beetween 0,001 - 0,002  
The Weakness is when EA make new order ( max order =6 ) the 1 until 6 using 0,1 Lots. I prefer when this EA open order, the first order must the smaller lots (mini=0,1 and micro 0,01) and the next open use 0,2 /0,02 (always increase the lots to hedge the price in the next new order)  
  
I can't modify this EA because I'm newbie  
  
someone please help me

Hi guys,  
I'm aTOTAL newbie at this and TOTALLY ignorant. I downloaded firebird v.1.03 yesterday evening on my Demo a/c and just added SL function @25 pips. No other changes. Today morning I find that I have $1000 in profits but, the amount of trades this version enters is phenomenal. It takes on 7-8 trades in a total of 3 pairs i.e. Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd and Aus/Usd. It opens up 2 to 3 trades in each pairs, sometimes in one direction and sometimes in opposite directions.   
My question is how do I control this? Making profit is fine but if the market reverses I may get a margin call. Demoing is fine but if I'm to use this EA on real a/c I may land in big trouble.  
Any ideas on this?  
I have put MM on so it takes on fractional lots but the sizes start increasing after some profit so now it is becoming dangerous it seems.  
Any feedback from experienced users is welcome.  
Because of SL function activation the profit is limited but drawdowns remain big.  
  
Vinesh

Firebird v 1c  
  
Does the Pip, DVlimit , Pipgoal or piploss setting need to be changed????  
  
  
for v3.2  
Does the Hedgetakeprofit, hedgestoploss, hedgelotfactor, slip , DVlimit in addition to above need to be changed??

I would like to try it out, but it is not clear which version of Firebird you are using. Can you clarify and if possible supply links where to download it together with the necessary indicators.  
  
I have been testing Firefox 63G for some time have have been having trouble with excessive drawdowns. I have also been trying opening two charts of the same pair, one using the EA on "buy only" and the other on "sell only" hoping to produce a hedging effect when the market is trending. So far, not too successful.  
  
Many thanks in advance  
  
Cheers

Samurai,  
  
I have been studying yr drive system.  
  
From my understanding, Firebird is built to profit from trades in BOTH directions, opening trades when it feels the trend is changing.  
  
By driving the EA in a single direction, say we drive long in a DAILY CHART UPTREND, we will be missing out on profitable sell trades in a retracement in a 5M chart !!  
  
Will our overall profit be lower compared to leaving the Firebird to open up trades as it sees fit???

The attached indicator is to help those who have been looking for a single and simple way of knowing the trend across all timeframes. Even by operating on a 1min chart, you'll be able to quickly figure out whether the 4hr and Daily charts are trending up/down so as to launch the Firebird EA in the right direction. Same applies to when the trend is beginning to change.

Check out this page... scroll down a little, and youll find the indicator that this is based on. Its a Guppy MACD setup.

Hi Glen  
  
I have been reading everything I can on Firebird EA and of course it goes back to 2006 and markets change too. I have only been involved in FX for about 3 months and I too live in Auckland. You mention we should move on from FB but prior to reading that I started up FB v3.2 (5digits) on an Alpari UK $5000 demo on Monday morning 10 August NZ time. It has done 40 completed trades with no losses and total profit $2103.94. It has 6 open trades showing a total float (hope I am using the right term) of -$1293. I am trading it out of the box with no settings changes on M5 charts with GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF and EURUSD.  
  
My question is, how can I make this less aggressive if I want to run it on a live account with $2000 starting capital? It seems a bit too good to be true. I would like to contact you sometime but I can not do a PM because this is my first post and I do not yet qualify for sending PM's.  
  
Cheers  
John

Hi Wackena  
It was a long time ago when you wrote the above post with the Firebird 3.2 attached. I am running Firebird 3.2 (5digits) on a $5000 demo which after a few days, starting Monday August 10, is up to $2180 profit and a negative float of about -$1350. Is this EA still a serious contender? Is there a later version? If I go to a $2000 live account, should I make it less aggressive? Cheers JohnRW

Here it comes, I have been trading FireBird v63 "LIVE" ) for almost 9 months so far with 300% profit with 72 trades and 1 loss (not too bad, right). My thought is the program I trade doesn't increase lot size as you progress, I have an idea to as you move on with let's say 10% risk involved your lot size increases or decreases as your Margin changes.  
  
Now, if you are a computer gig, help me out to stick it into program. That;s what I have so far. It doesn't work though for some reason, but it will, it is just a matter of time, I will make it work. Need a little push ))  
  
CurrentPipStep=PipStep;  
if(IncreasementType>0)  
{  
CurrentPipStep=MathSqrt(MyOrdersTot al())*PipStep; CurrentPipStep=MathPow(MyOrdersTota l(),IncreasementType)*PipStep;   
}   
LogWrite("CurrentPipStep="+CurrentP ipStep);  
}  
Comment("");  
if (PipStep) = PipStep;  
else = AccountFreeMargin() / 1000.0 * (RiskPercent / 100.0);  
  
Do you have an idea why I doesn't work, you are more when welcome to stick your ideas in to in. ))

I have been Strategy Testing a program unrelated to Firebird that increases/decreases lot size based on % of changing account balances. Good idea but hard to administer. Get the lot size a little too large and margin out. Take a loss when the account balance/lot size is large and loose nine months of gain. Double ouch.  
  
The solution? Not sure. Be very conservative with the percent of lot size changes? Drain off profits all along the way, (best choice of the two) in which case the account balance does not get dangeriously high?  
A great and reasonably priced, (Euros) fast programing service that did my code was Witold Wosniak at [vitovd@gmail.com](mailto:vitovd@gmail.com). Witold is in Poland and has perfect English and amazing knowledge of Expert Advisors. He is a rare find and will help you endlessly as you progress in experience. Good luck in your trading.

well, 9 month and 300% I will take a risk, reasonable risk. 10% is a reasonable risk, isn't it? You cannot make money, and (I am talking about MONEY not penis) do it without increasing the lot size. It just doesn't make any sence to me.

Today morning I find that I have $1000 in profits but, the amount of trades this version enters is phenomenal. It takes on 7-8 trades in a total of 3 pairs i.e. Eur/Usd, Gbp/Usd and Aus/Usd. It opens up 2 to 3 trades in each pairs, sometimes in one direction and sometimes in opposite directions.

I don't consider penis to be a type of currency either... But everybody to their own I guess!

Hi Sam,  
How exactly do YOU know when the trend is "clear", would this mean when (on short for example) the candle turns red again that you start EA again or is there something else you do to, reason i ask is because of ranging markets at the time, you might end up losing what you just gained

Good day everyone!  
  
I have correctly loaded the indicators, the template and the EA yesterday. The smiley sign appears on the topright corner, which means that it was loaded correctly right?  
  
I also followed the step by step instruction of Samurai on post 2090.  
  
But my EA is not making any trades!  
  
I am on IBFX Metatrader.  
  
I would appreciate suggestions on what's wrong. Has any of you experienced this? How was this solved?  
  
Thanks!

Trust me, that is the biggest BS he could have told you.  
  
My advise: go to another broker, they are around on about every street corner nowadays, so be careful you pick a reliable one.

Or Skyline can you edit your first post and add the most recent version?

There seems to be mixed reviews on this EA. I noticed on other threads discussing firebird that for some traders it is profitable and others who used it for a while noticed a large drawdown. Maybe a poll on this thread or another showing how many traders find it profitable or not would be a good indication.

Not much sense in taking a poll. The firebird is legendary. It has been around for a long time, and many many people have tried to make it work. EVERYONE WISHES it would work, since the concept is so elegant and very profitable when things are right.  
  
One thing for sure, Left to its own devices, it will make you rich, and then make you poor even quicker.   
  
I know a few guys who have done just fine with it, by intervening a managing it, turning it on only when market conditions are right, turning it on only on certain times of day. I hope someday, someone is able to make it work.  
  
Look for the "Driving the firebird" thread. It may have had the best success so far. It's an old thread, and I don't know how active it is.

Has anyone been able to test this on a live account? I've tried to get a few versions to run live but all failed. They only seem to work in backtest.  
  
Versions I have tried but do not work live  
v065tf  
v63G  
v63H04(EA) 5 digit platform  
v1.04a  
  
I am currently testing v3.2(5 digits) on a live platform but have not had a trade in a few hours. I've even changed the MA timeframe to 1. Anyone manage to test any version of this live. I am using [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") MT4 platform.

You probably know this, but just in case...Smallest lot size on Oanda MT4 is 0.01 STD Lot, 1000 units. Is that the lot size you really want? May be a bit much with Firebird...

Yes I know that's the minimum. Right now, I can't even get Firebird to even open 1 trade...

Hello everyone,  
  
I'm new to this thread and I was impressed about this ea,but I'm a little confused about the version and the settings I should use. Can anyone give me the best version and settings for a 5 digit broker(Alpari) that really works on a live account?
