Brief Story  
  
After 3 years of development of my EA, MQL5 Ltd decided to remove my seller account along with the [product](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RJX7r2VACBYJ:https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/10868) right after I've reported scam brokers appearing on their CDN and app with no possibility for negotiation. Therefore I've decided to open source and give my EA for free.  
  
I'm releasing it as it is, without promises and warranty. It is a very complex project and due to serious limitations of the MetaTrader 4/5 platforms which I've learned during development, and due to an unfortunate MQL5 decision, I've decided to not use the platform as the main one and move on to other interesting projects.  
  
To clarify, the free code doesn't mean that scammers (which are everywhere) can steal the code and re-sell it. The code is enough secured to prevent that happen. If you decide to distribute copies of such a program, 'you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received'. Otherwise, expect some troubles.  
  
Furthermore, I won't take any criticism or get into long opinion-based argues without any claims to support (as I've learned it's a common vibe in trading communities), so don't be surprised when you'd be ignored. If you believe you've found the bug, just raise the issue, and I'll try to help in my spare time. Any contributors are welcomed.  
  
Due to the complexity of the system, don't expect to just work right after placing it on some random account, then being surprised after few weeks it doesn't work as expected without any effort to understand how the EA works. Please read the documentation thoroughly, get familiar with all the params, make some [valid backtests](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Backtesting-in-MT4), and adjust the params according to your needs.  
  
EA Intro  
  
The **EA31337** trading robot is taking the currency trading on the next level by providing coordinated multi-timeframe algorithms which makes the trading 24/7 very simple experience.  
  
EA Features

  1. Over 30 optimized strategies to choose from, coordinated and working as one single algorithm to analyze market on multiple timeframes at the same time (M1-M30).
  2. Over 30 major technical indicators analyzed in real time (on every single tick).
  3. Risk Ratio manages automatically your risk given your current equity/balance and the market conditions.
  4. An exceptional number of customizable user parameters (over 300).
  5. Task scheduler which queues and re-trades the rejected trades due to high volatility or broker requotes.
  6. Trade prioritiser aims to prioritise trading according to high demand or market limits.

EA Basic Params  
The EA provides the following basic params:

  1. **Trade**

    1. **Max orders, Max orders per type** \- Sets the limit of total or per-strategy orders to open. Set 0 for auto, so it knows exactly how many trades to open given your balance, a number of trades, Stop Out levels and market conditions (see: Risk Ratio).
    2. **Lot size** \- Sets a lot size of the order to trade. Set 0 for auto calculation based on your equity/balance ratio.
    3. **InitNoOfDaysToWarmUp** \- A Warm-up period in days to reduce lot size. Helps to protect balance against unknown market conditions.
    4. **Max take profit/stop loss -** Limits when to close the order with profit or loss.
    5. **Trend method** \- Method of calculating the current trend for the trades.
    6. **Min pip gap** \- Min gap between trades per strategy.
    7. **Tick ignore method** \- Sets method for ignoring certain ticks.
    8. **CloseOrderAfterXHours** \- Sets a number of hours after profitable trades are closed (negative number includes non-profitable trades).

  

  2. **Profit and loss**

    1. **Max Take profit/Max Stop loss** \- Limits when to close the order with profit or loss (in pips).
    2. **TrailingStop/TrailingProfit** \- Extra trailing stops
    3. **TrailingStopAddPerMinute** \- Decrease trail stop per minute (pip/min)

  

  1. **Risk**

    1. **Risk margin per order/in total** \- Limits trade risk in %.

  

  1.     1. **Risk ratio -** If set to 0, it automatically calculates your risk given your current equity/balance and market conditions.
    2. **Risk margin -** Sets the risk of the margin in percentage which you want to risk per each trade. Set 0 for auto.
    3. **Min/Max profit factor per strategy** \- Sets min/max required profit factor of strategy to trade. If the limit is reached, it disables non-successful strategies.

  

  2. **Boosting**

    1. **Boosting: by trend factor, by the best daily/weekly/monthly strategy** \- Activates lot size boosting by its profit factor or the most successful strategies over a certain period.

  

  3. **Account conditions** \- Invokes condition-based user configurable actions on certain account or market conditions (e.g. close profitable orders on high equity or before margin call happens).
  4. **Strategy-based Signal Methods -** Unique filtering system which enhances technical indicators and trades only on successful market conditions.

and many other params (over 300), for more details, check the [documentation page](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki) .

Please refer to the _Journal log_ for details. Make sure you have got an uncompressed version of it (e.g. EA31337-Lite-Full, [v1.075](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/download/v1.075/EA31337-Lite-Full-v1.075.ex4.gz) at the time of writing) as GitHub doesn't allow .ex4 release binaries anymore.

Thanks for the advanced EA. Trying to figure out why most of the trades are being closed at a small loss. Not so easy because there are so many trailing options.

Due to limitations of MT4 platform or lack of data, EA automatically disables strategies which are not able to read the data. The EA tries to trade on multiple timeframes at the same time as best as it can, given the limitations of the platform, so it's doing some initial checks and automatically disables strategies which failed to initialize.  
  
So basically:

> Cannot initialize indicator for the Envelopes M15

  
means that Envelopes technical indicator which trades on M15 is not available during backtesting for some reason. In other words, [iEnvelopes()](https://docs.mql4.com/indicators/ienvelopes) function returned zero, instead of proper data.  
  
This may happen when you don't have HST files for all the timeframes. Sometimes it's because of the MT4 bug, where backtesting on lower timeframes, higher timeframes aren't activated for some reason. But based on the screenshot that all M1, M5, M15, M30, H1, H4 and D1 are on the list, could be a missing HST data for M15 for given period. For easier understanding the code, error number corresponds to line number from the [source code file](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/EA31337.mq4).  
  
You can bypass the validation checks by disabling ValidateSettings param, but the results could be not as expected.

The EA has been optimized for EURUSD only, in unknown market conditions, the default params would need some tweaking.  
  
For easier understanding what causing specific trades to close, hovering on the buy/sell arrows, or checking the comments of trades or the _Journal log_ , should give you the indication which strategy was responsible for the trades. Another way is to run the full backtest and check the report (either in _Journal log_ or text file which has been generated in _files/_ folder). Then identify the losing strategies and consider tweaking them or disabling. For simplicity, it's also good to backtest few strategies at the same time and choose the best. For optimization tweaks, it's good to focus only on one strategy at the same time.  
  
In the recent version, I've also activated the condition ([CloseOrderAfterXHours](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/lite/ea-input.mqh#L52)) which automatically closes trades after 24h. This is due to fact that normal market conditions on the next day are completely different from the technical condition (e.g. daily pivotal points, etc.) which were used to open specific trades so they cannot be taken into the account. In other words, profits from the trades which were opened for few days are merely a luck. Since EA opens the trades based on the technical indicators, the trades need to be closed after 24h to provide reliable trading results especially during backtesting, otherwise, one few lucky trades could pollute optimization results by tweaking the params based on few lucky shots which would never happen again (that's the main problem of many other EAs which are showing great results, but only during backtesting). I hope that makes sense. This is, of course, my point of view, feel free to disable _CloseOrderAfterXHours_ , if you think that's the reason for trades being closed at a small loss. But it could be also something else. I could activate _CloseOrderAfterXHours_ by default only during optimization or backtesting, but not for release files, but small changes after heavy optimization tests could have some drastic effects, so you would be using something that was not tested using the same params.

You're posting something random without any context or support. I've invested some time into ZuluTrade and I wouldn't recommend to anybody using this service unless you want to blow your account, no matter how good is EA.  
  
The facts are:  
  
\- This was barely an experiment in 2015 for the sake of curiosity how it goes using v1.061 and v1.062 unreleased (anywhere) versions. The first official release (~v1.066) was in 2016. And comparing to v1.075 is not appropriate, as it been changed over hundreds of times since then, and you may check the revision history.  
\- ZuluTrade is not designed to run high-frequency robots due to limits (such as opened orders per day, updates per minute, TP/SL updates per day).  
\- For example, ZuluTrade limits 30 orders per day for demo accounts and there is some limit on updating the trades as well. And the EA was generating at least hundreds of them per day at that time.  
\- As far as I remember, there were up to 1000 updates per day, which EA used the limit within first few hours as the early version of EA was generating around few thousand order modification requests per day.  
  
Therefore, due to limits, 80% of the trades were rejected by ZuluTrade system causing it to fail. Even after some tweaks (as I was attempting to create a separate ZuluTrade-friendly version), there is no way that EA, or any other high-frequency can work there. I've invested enough time into their service and after some learning, I have not used it anymore since then.

Unfortunately, some SET files aren't back compatible. Most of the time the default settings included with the release files are the best.  
  
To find the compatible SET files, you may go to [_EA31337-Lite-Sets_ repo](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets) and dig for some _.__set_ files (hitting _T_ on the repo and typing ".set" can give you some list). The compatible version should be visible in the first line of the file after opening it. For SET file for the specific version, you may check the git history. As generating them based on the optimization tests costs a lot. My usual process was to execute hundreds of instances on AWS each testing headlessly certain components of EA, however to generate a reliable SET file for one configuration (pair+spread+year) costs over few thousands of dollars per release version and one tiny modification, mistake or tweak doubles the amount. That's the reason I no longer provide any SET files for the latest versions, as the process is a bit overkill.  
  
You can always compare two files using some diff utility, check the differences and change the settings manually.

These are the best to my knowledge, however, each version could generate a different result.  
  
To see how the result was generated and against which version, click on the image (at the repo page) and zoom in. Each chart should have the details how the test was performed. These results were generated by fully automated systems, not by manual means. That means there were generated by using repeatable/reproducible environment. Some of them could be out-of-date, so they need some work along with the EA while it evolves.

Hello all,  
  
I think we just need to be appreciative that people come on FF to share hence, should thank people like Kenorb just for sharing.  
  
Please remember those people that are busy making money in Forex will never reveal their skills, knowledge and strategy on sites like FF.   
  
So when somebody does come along to share ideas, whatever they maybe, the least we can do is look into it to see if we can learn from it and help towards our own development/testing/strategy on Forex.  
  
Because of the complexity of the EA it is sensible to back-test on low spread currency pair ranges. So if some of you can do this and report back would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Raf

I didn't say it can work. Depending on the market conditions, it needs the right settings. The EA is fully customizable by the user with over 300 params. The challenge is to configure them right for the given market conditions. In the end, I'm not selling it anymore, and it's up to you if you want to use it or not.

A lot of parameters for optimization.  
Tell me please, is there any advice on the initial choice of optimized parameters?

Backtest allways provide very good results. Do you have forward test results? Myfxbook?

Here is my suggestion. Run the backtest with the default settings for some longer selected period. Check the final report at _Journey log_ or generated text file in _tester/files/_ folder (you can access from: _File, Open Data Folder_ in a top menu bar). The file will given you the profit stats per strategy. Choose the most profitable strategy which you like, then set all Disable all _Enable for xxM_ params apart from the strategy which works the best for you given the dataset. So you can either decide to enable one timeframe for the given strategy or group of timeframes for the strategy.  
  
Then start by optimizing specific single strategy, depending on what's the problem. Describing the optimization process is a topic for a book. But here are some hints:  
\- If the strategy doesn't trade often, reset filters: 'Open condition' all to 0, re-test, if it's still the issue, reset 'Signal Method' to 0 as well.  
\- If the strategy trades too often, do the opposite, so optimize 'Signal method' (which acts like the 1st layer of filters), then 'Open condition' (which acts like a 2nd layer of filters).  
\- When optimizing 'Signal Method' or 'Open condition', check for the ranges which strategy supports. If it's too much, do step on every odd number (like 3, 5 or 7).  
\- If the amount of trades feels right, but there are some misses, then adjust the standard technical settings such as period, applied price, etc. depending on the params supporting by the strategy.  
-If you test one strategy across multiple timeframes, and one timeframe is profitable, other not, try optimizing Period/Deviation ratio. This is kind of multiplier between timeframes.  
\- If the profit takes of the strategy aren't feeling right, optimize only 'Trail profit method'.  
\- If the stop losses of the strategy aren't feeling right, optimize only 'Trail stop method'.  
\- You may optimize both trail profit and stop methods at the same time, that would be an ideal, but it all comes to the power of your machine and size of the dataset.  
  
It would be worth to write some optimization guide, but at the end, it's not a fixed process and there are many variables to take into the account.

Backtests provide good results when you limit your optimization on a fixed dataset (it's kind of play and rewind button, so it doesn't really take into the account what-if you would start at the specific point of time). My approach was to optimize against 2-3 years only (2014-2016), then run the backtests against all years separately using the same parameters, this way you know it works in the new market conditions.  
  
Most of EAs run optimization process on the same fixed period as they do backtesting. So when they run backtest for 5-10 years in a row on the same dataset, they look very smooth. Also, it looks smooth because authors usually set low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") as 0 or 10 and usually hide that information from the screenshots, or it looks smooth due to the long period of testing and you don't see most of the problems which they're struggling with as they're managing the account with a large unreal sum, secondly tiny change such as a starting date could change the results dramatically, so it doesn't really take into the account what-if you would start at the specific point of time. Therefore I've tests run for 2010,2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016 separately each using the same parameters. I'm not claiming it works perfectly, but I've tried my best.  
  
I don't have any 3rd party providers as everything takes time and money to maintain. I had once VPSs where Windows was constantly restarting, or MT4 was disconnecting or updating for unknown reasons, or some other MT4 common anomalies, so I was working on the reliable environment where I can run EA in the isolated environment on Linux for stability reasons, but I didn't have time to finish it.

Manual backtesting of EAs is a very complex process, especially this one due to trading on multiple timeframes at the same time, and the results from other people may be not always reliable as around 80% of people who will share the charts, will get it wrong. There are too many variables that could go wrong. Here are few common errors:  
\- Using _Birt's CSV2FXT_ old script to convert their CSV data into FXT. This script is old, [no longer maintained](https://eareview.net/tick-data/faq-troubleshooting) and [buggy](https://github.com/EA31337/Birt-CSV2FXT/issues/3), so the dataset could be not reliable as you would think.  
\- Setting FXT files to read-only. What happens when you don't set it? It's going to validated by the platform and most likely wiped out (zeroed) as invalid and your test won't proceed. That means your dataset was never reliable and by setting it read-only, you're forcing platform to accept it. That's why I've written my [own tools](https://github.com/FX31337/FX-BT-Scripts/blob/master/convert_csv_to_mt.py) to convert the data, so the files can be validated (checked for data errors) by the platform itself and accepted when the files have the proper write permissions.  
\- Using so-called 99% quality data. Such thing doesn't exist. It is a myth sold by scammers and other people still believe it. The 99% _modelquality_ is nothing more than a [single, hardcoded number in your FXT file](https://github.com/EA31337/MT-Formats/blob/a44e5192a0eeacdf218c6264b7f250e5a3255fdb/fxt-405-refined.mqh#L53), that's the reason why scam people advise you to set your FXT files read-only, to perform tests on fake 99% quality data which in reality the dataset can be non-reliable not at all, not accepted by the platform, but you're basically forcing the platform to accept it.   
\- There are many other factors which could go wrong, converting FXT, but missing some HST, or polluting the data with current data of your broker, etc.  
  
Based on above, when you optimize your EA on not reliable data, guess what would happen. There is no evidence that's the results what you see are reliable at all. No matter whether they're smooth or not. In the end, it's just chart on the screen.  
  
For example, when I've found few bugs in scripts which were converting CSV data into HST format miscalculating OHLC data, guess how the charts looked after the optimization. They EA didn't have any struggles to generate smooth charts. After fixing the issues, I had to spend several weeks to re-optimize everything from scratch and generate new reliable charts.   
  
So, most of the backtesting that people perform, usually are based on some old non-reliable steps. Therefore I've created some [guide page how to backtest the EA](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Backtesting-in-MT4), I'm not claiming it's a perfect method, but given the platform limitations and based on my understanding, it's much more reliable test that other people will perform using old, non-reliable scripts or datasets, which they believe it works without validating the results for them-self.

I would like to see longer time frames than 30 mins in the strategies. I also find it problematic to configure how the EA closes trades. A basket TP feature would probably also work well.

Kenorb,  
  
Thanks for laying out a comprehensive check list...  
  
Could you please confirm if understood this correctly. Are the above pitfalls laid out by you, are overlooked by most if not all? So in general the Test Results for any other EA floating in the forum could potentially be wrong?  
  
Thanks

It's possible to add H1 and more custom timeframes such as M2,M3,M4,M6,M10,M12,M20,H1,H2,H3,H4,H6,H8,H12, but then the params would be too difficult to manage. The EA needs the heavy refactor first before that happens.

This is the platform bug, you need to upgrade your _MetaEditor_. That's the thing, every platform version they change something in the language syntax, and code either breaks or not.

EA was developed in the isolated environment, the idea was to not trust anything 3rd party, so everything (every utility involved) was developed fully from scratch apart of obvious dependency which is the platform. The MT4 platform doesn't support forward tests, only MT5. EA has partial support for MT5 platform, but it needs some further work. I never run in the long term, because there was always something to improve, so the results would be mixture of different version running on the same account. I wanted to run it somewhere, but it never got into a perfect state where I was happy to run it. I only once run some old version which I don't remember, which from $350 it get into $2200 within few weeks, then forgot about the account and lost it due to some bug which I believe I've fixed it later on. But it's a matter of the right configuration.

Most of the people who were sending charts which looked very bad, they were performed in the wrong way without being aware of it. So I had to spend a lot of time explaining how to do the backtesting, most of them gave up after that since it was too complex process. Since then I've added many checks to babysit the wrong backtest, but still, you can backtest in the wrong way (old methods, wrong converted dataset, see post #22).  
One of the checks is to make sure all indicators are initialized properly and not returning any rubbish, post #5). Secondly, any performed backtest is also accompanied with the text file (generated by EA at the end of the run) such as [this one](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/blob/59cac57bcce1efef5f389a0bfb7ef8311c8853a2/EURUSD/default/2000USD/20-spread/5-digits/2015/_test_results/EURUSD-2000USD-2015.01.06-2015.12.30-20spread-\(5\)-M30-report.txt) (also attached). So so-called 99% quality test, could be the very worst.  
Things to note during good backtesting is Ticks per min and bar, Total ticks and bars.  
  
\- If 'Ticks per min' are lower than 60, then it's like one tick per second, so it's not a really good simulation. Good tick data has few hundred of ticks per minute. This relates to your FXT data.  
\- If 'Total ticks' doesn't sum up, like one tick or less per second for the whole period, that means the dataset is rubbish or consist huge data gaps. For example, large price gaps are reported at the bottom of the file, however, still the price gaps are not the same as data gaps.  
\- Normally, a year test should have at least few hundred millions of ticks. For example, for 2014 year I have over 73mlns ticks, for 2015 - 80mln. So if you run backtest for multiple years with less than 100mln of ticks, there is something wrong with your data.  
\- 'Total bars' needs to sum up to what you're testing as well. This relates to your HST data.  
\- The general rule is, if ticks are not right, check your FXT data, if bars are not right, check your HST files.  
\- Furthermore, the report file shows the calculated real 'Modelling quality' (see: [CalcModellingQuality()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/master/Chart.mqh#L592)), not the fake/hardcoded one, and it's calculated based on the official docs from MT4. This value is more like bar quality between timeframes, nothing to do with your tick data as the percentage changes based on the timeframe you run. In the end, it still doesn't tell you whether you tick data is good or not. The more important is to how many ticks and bars have been processed during the period.  
\- Hint: Never use Control points, at least for this EA, always All ticks, as the results can be completely different.  
  
So if somebody post some chart without sharing how the test was performed, such as real modelling quality, total bars, ticks, spread, period, how HST/FXT were generated, whether files were read-only or not, input params, it may suggest that was performed in the wrong way. In this case, I'd request sharing the report file which gives more info how the test was done.  
  
Another way to test that the dataset is reliable is to do:  
\- Convert CSV into HST and FXT using a script (convert_csv_to_mt.py). Only 1 or 2 days is enough.  
\- Consider checking HST and FXT data using the script to read binary data back to CSV (convert_mt_to_csv.py) and compare.  
\- Run EA with the option to export all ticks back into CSV (RecordTicksToCSV) on this short period (1 or 2 max).  
\- Compare original CSV data with the one generated by EA.  
Last time I've checked and the data was 100% accurate. However, this only applies to ticks data and it doesn't validate consistency of HST data (technical indicator data). For example, miscalculation of OHLCV values in HST files could produce different results. I don't have scripts to validate HST, but not setting HST files to read-only, you're allowing the platform to validate it for you.

No set file for the latest version. The latest SET file generated by optimization bots has been translated into the default settings and it's part of the release file.  
  
Basically, EA learns on losses and improves over time, but it can take days or weeks. The challenge is to understand the cause of the losses, whether they're just temporary, or long-term, which is not easy. By default, EA got 21 days to warm up (InitNoOfDaysToWarmUp) to allow minimal losses. During that time it prioritizes which strategy is better than the other, so it manages and prioritizes them according to the settings (such as boosting) so it slowly increases lot size for the strategies which were proven to work in the current market conditions or disable (temporary or permanently) certain group of strategies which doesn't work at all (ProfitFactorMinToTrade). But this process can take time and cannot be guaranteed to work without spending some effort into the proper analysis what's going on.

\- EA Order Comments  
  
The comments are implemented (see [order_comment in ExecuteOrder()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/2d3f14053fa44c62492e734bbd31ce65caee9124/src/EA31337.mq4#L1074)), I'm not sure why they won't work, could be a platform or EA bug. The comment should contain which strategy opened the position, on which timeframe and the spread. When the position is closed manually by EA, it should also include the reason for closing.  
  
\- Close all button Profit/Loss  
  
There are conditions and actions for closing all profits or loss (like ['Close all in profit', or 'Close all!'](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/2d3f14053fa44c62492e734bbd31ce65caee9124/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L363)). The missing part is to have the account condition on EA exit. I've added a new [feature request](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues/20).  
  
\- Profit/Loss and Pip Counter  
  
All stats are calculated and shown in the chart (profit/loss pips per hour), further stats are generated in the text file which is generated in files/ folder. Check the file, and if anything is missing, please elaborate your idea.

Thanks for doing this. Are you only testing v1.072, or v1.075 as well? Each version is progressing with fixes and logic improvements, however, after the logic changes, the optimized settings could be behind. So I was curious whether you found v1.072 better optimized than v1.075

Sorry for not being more clear. My thought was that, if the user sees a satisfactory running profit even before the preset targets are met, he/she could click a button to close all trades and retire for the day/week etc. This is what I did - Used an external "close all" script to close all open positions and disable the EA.

Only 1.072. Because somewhere in this thread, i read that this version is functioning without issues, so, I chose to run it. Next week I'll run test on both simultaneously.

You can play with conditions, so like:  
  
\- when either account Equity is higher than 10% or 20%, or 'Max. daily balance > max. weekly', or 'Current day in profit', then 'close all profits' or/and 'suspend all strategies' (then another to unsuspend in the new week)  
  
It gives some flexibility, it's a matter of testing and clarifying, which conditions or actions can be improved or added.

Yes of course. Anyway, my idea is only cosmetic. Not functional. No worries.

Main EA is made of 3 versions (4th is on the way). The one on Zulu was experimental Rider version, not Lite. Secondly, as already mentioned in post #12, Zulu couldn't handle hundreds of trades per day and 80% of trade updates were rejected causing different results on their side.  
  
Would you like to learn what EA in Rider mode can do? My backtests showed on broker data, starting as low as $1000 or $2000 deposit to over $100000 profit in first 6 months, then few million in a year, even on a high spread. It's a risky mode, but very powerful. Data accurate and directly from the broker.  
  
Here are the different backtest stats using different configurations and it was back in 2015 (v1.062) before hundreds of other improvements:

Any hints of how to optimize a stratgy that overall loses?  
  
Eg. GBPJPY 2014-2016:  
  
Profit factor: 1.34, Total net profit: 55.27EUR [+217.46/-162.19] (2876.73pips), Total orders: 548 (Won: 67.2% [368] / Loss: 32.8% [180]) - CCI M15  
Profit factor: 1.32, Total net profit: 26.15EUR [+109.16/-83.01] (1444.02pips), Total orders: 60 (Won: 63.3% [38] / Loss: 36.7% [22]) - Envelopes M30  
Profit factor: 1.11, Total net profit: 185.85EUR [+1952.74/-1766.89] (25831.79pips), Total orders: 2068 (Won: 77.8% [1609] / Loss: 22.2% [459]) - WPR M15  
Profit factor: 1.06, Total net profit: 105.27EUR [+1966.44/-1861.17] (26013.05pips), Total orders: 1674 (Won: 71.5% [1197] / Loss: 28.5% [477]) - WPR M30  
  
Total net profit: -203.68 EUR  
  
Seems MT4 optimizer doesn't yield any results during optimization so maybe it has to be done by hand.

Please include one version of EA and one set of files that are profitable. Without that thread it makes no sense.

Would you like to learn what EA in Rider mode can do? My backtests showed on broker data, starting as low as $1000 or $2000 deposit to over $100000 profit in first 6 months, then few million in a year, even on a high spread. It's a risky mode, but very powerful....

Hi Kenorb, thank you for sharing your system.  
**Do you have in Zulu or Myfxbook or elsewhere an audited forward test?**  
In Zulu you have an experimental version, ok. Where we can see the results of the good version?

Please re-read posts #12 and #44 about Zulu, the service is not compatible due to their limitations and it's not going to work as I've already tried. For forward results they were shared in this thread, check post #36.  
  
I didn't run any forward tests, during constant development. EA needs at least few weeks to warm-up, so when next version is released, then I'd end-up maintaining multiple versions, and I don't have time for this. I'm a Mac user for 20+ years and it's not going to change, and running EA under macOS/Linux (such as wine) is troublesome for me and platform is really not compatible with my everyday stack which I'm using. Once I find some time, I'll publish.

You posted all results of all profitable strategies. That's good for you. So if you found at least 4 profitable strategies (based on 3 indicators CCI, Envelopes and WPR and 2 timeframes M15 and M30). So why not to disable the other losing one, and focus your optimization process first on these 3.  
  
Optimization is complex and time-consuming, not really designed for humans. Since you've got a good starting point, focus on profitable CCI, Envelopes and WPR-based strategies, make them better by tweaking/optimizing only 1-2 parameters at the same time (with only 2 timeframes: M15 and M30 which worked for you). You may consider running optimization only for one strategy at a time, by disabling the other one. During optimization, consider disabling boosting (to have more reliable results). After optimization of one strategy, test them together (the selected one which are good). After that find another good strategy candidate. Focus optimization on one strategy and make it good, then re-enable all selected one. Repeat the process. After you found group of strategies which meet your needs, final optimization stage is to optimize non-based strategy params (such as boosting).

You're missing the include files. So you need to solve the dependencies. Make sure you're using multiple repositories across includes which are created for the same version. Classes from the other repo are also progressing, so not every version of classes are compatible with the main code (classes repo is not versioned using the same method, but main repo has specific submodule references to it, which points to the compatible version). Check the [Compilation](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Compilation) guide. To see which version is compatible with which files, on the main repo switch to the specific tag and browse the files (next to the folder you should see git's SHA1 hash). On macOS I do symlinks across repo which was cloned recursively, so everything is consistent, on Windows, good luck.

I run mt4 under Linux/wine.  
  
The prefix32 directory is 1.5 GB so I could upload it to Mega, if you are interested. Then you only need to install the newest wine and then run mt4.

Thanks,  
  
I just wonder why the strategies are shown as profitable but overall net profit is negative?  
  
So difficult to know where the source of loss is.

Probably you've copied it from the _Journal log_ which may drop some line. Check for the text file which was generated in the _tester/files_ folder, the summary of profit/loss should match. Consider posting it.

Wait then for others to post it then, as I don't have anything up-to-date for the reason mentioned for few times already. Keeping it maintained and babysit not-stable platform takes time and I'm not using the same tools as others do.

I've got 20+ MT4 platforms and few MT5 on my macOS, so running platform it-self under wine is not the problem. Availability is not the problem either, as I've got hundreds of platforms since build 200 (even some MT3 files) which I can run under wine. It's the question how bad it is. The versions are not consistent and easy to be broken. Due to the complexity of the code, the EA may not compile (as per post #27) on one version, but works for newest version which comes with MetaTrader 5, because MT4 is no longer maintained and cannot be downloaded from official sources anymore, so it's a bit unmaintainable mess. What is worse, most of the brokers don't provide up-to-date version of the platform. Another example, the older code needs to be compiled with older compilers, newer with newer versions, sometimes specific part of the code needs to be compiled with the [specific build](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48301425/55075), or needs to be refactored to babysit the MQL language changes. Of course, I've reported hundreds of bugs to MT, most of the bugs never been fixed, either for no reason, or reason that MT4 is no longer supported, or they simply don't care, or they do these problems deliberately to make it difficult for people to create something fully working. Another thing which breaks, the wizard, not every wine version can handle the installer (like this [issue](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/issues/113)), so you end up with [fixing and hacking](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/pull/39/commits/a569b2d9a5425c91d3f8c9f937e335d123d303d9) more libraries to make it work, and at the end, next version pop up and you start again. Another thing is how to perform the proper backtest, half of the time you're doing [reverse-engineering](https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/q/8003/12021) of the formats which were deliberately created this way, to make the trouble for you, than focusing on the actual backtesting. So instead of doing proper backtesting, you need to hack into many file formats such as FXT (now HCC), HST, [SRV](https://github.com/FX31337/FX-BT-Scripts/issues/64) (where some broker values are hardcoded), some of them are heavily encrypted, in order to modify the values to simply run the backtest exactly how you want it (otherwise the result aren't reliable). You think it's easy? I can pay few hundred bounty if you write a Python script to [read and modify SRV file](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/34678520-script-to-read-srv-format) (especially a lot size value), good luck. And finally, MT4 is no longer supported and going to be dropped soon. Furthermore, MQL deliberately removed MT4 installer last year from their site, including [command-line compiler](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32459182/55075) which I was using, and compiling files using MetaEditor is a [nightmare](https://stackoverflow.com/q/41580912/55075) (like the [exit codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Windows) are not consistent, and they clearly said they're not going to fix it). So trust me, running under wine for such project is a huge problem. Therefore, this is not the platform which I want to work with.

I understand.  
  
You could port your ea to QuantConnect lean, a c# trading engine.   
  
<https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean>  
  
Mono works fine on Linux. Probably also on Mac.

The '_variable already_ ' is another problem how platform handles the includes. The compiler inclusion logic is bad designed and works differently on different versions, so I usually do #ifndef FILE_MQH, #define FILE_MQH, // main code here, #endif, to babysit the compiler flows, unless MQL is going to fix this properly. Check [Chart.mqh](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/488c10c210802985dd6c6fe4afa852ed264fc1ba/Chart.mqh#L39) file for the example.  
Then S_BANDS is defined in [ea-enums.mqh](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.076/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L171) (check for [v1.076](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/tree/v1.076) tag). In master branch, it's commented, as I did start some refactor, and it's not finished and it may take awhile, or not at all.

The line  
_trade_params = _params;_  
  
should be replaced with the line  
_trade_params.slippage = _params.slippage;_

This is what it says it is. Your timeframes aren't active. Either you lack necessary data to perform your backtest (check your HST files) or it is related to a platform bug (so try on M15 or M30 instead as it may activate timeframes differently). This was also already mentioned in post #5 and post #7.

This may break the code. What's broken, is the platform. If you upgrade to at least MetaEditor build 1745 it may just work as it is.

Release files with the date got the expiration date, it may work, but only for the backtesting, not for the demo testing.

The latest MetaEditor build is **1601** while the latest MT4 build is **1090** both dated **19.05.2017** ...  
  
MetaEditor build **1745** is not available yet, it should come with the MT4 build **1118** dated **20.04.2018** which some guys tell about it, but not yet available for MT4 community ...  
  
Do you have a MT4 build later of build **1090** ?

Each broker got their own "latest" version (e.g. different version for Windows, Linux and macOS), which practically they got old buggy builds, because they're not updating it very often and MT4 is not much supported now (latest official MT4 installer removed from MQL CDN servers, and the brokers doesn't update their platforms often, or not at all). So you can either find the broker which got their "real" latest version, or just copy MetaEditor from the MT5, it's the same thing. I had ME build 1745 working with MT4 and compiled MQL4 code successfully.  
  
$ wine filever metaeditor64.exe   
\--a-- W32 APP - 5.0.0.1755 shp 37,719,192 03-12-2018 metaeditor64.exe  
  
For example, ME build 1755 should have been released on 18.01.2018 as far as I know.

Recently I've lost the infrastructure which I was using for backtesting (german servers, AWS+Jenkins), so it'll take a while to do it again (as I was on holidays and bill didn't go through on-time). The latest EA version could have the latest fixes in place, but it doesn't mean it has been optimized as good as the previous ones, so it's a matter of testing it.  
  
However, if you're on Linux/macOS, I've automated backtesting using scripts. So, using this [repo](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM), you can run like:  
  
./scripts/run_backtest.sh -v -t -M4.0.0.1010 -d 10000 -p EURUSD -m 1-2 -y 2017 -s 10 -b DS -D5 -e EA31337  
  
Where -m 1-2 is the range of months, or drop the -m param for the full year. The _.ex4_ you can place somewhere in the current dir.  
  
See these CI [builds](https://travis-ci.org/EA31337/FX-MT-VM) for the example and expected behaviour.  
  
If you're on Windows, you may consider Vagrant approach (see [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/blob/master/Vagrantfile), Docker support is on the way).  
  
If you're on Linux/Unix/macOS, this should be straightforward. If you're testing this on Windows and struggling with setup, I won't be able to help much (unless you're doing this within VM after _vagrant ssh_ command).  
  
Note: One challenge which I got with backtesting recently was, that when running MT4 in off-line test by default platform is forcing the test with Lot step 0.1 for 5-digit symbols (which is wrong), where EA is more designed to run with _Lot step_ _0.01_ on 5-digit pairs, unless the balance is huge. Larger lot steps don't give EA much flexibility and not enough time learn about the market conditions, so backtesting with lot size of 0.1 isn't expected. The only workaround is to connect to one of the brokers which support micro lots (but at the same polluting the existing settings with the specific broker's settings), so I don't know how to enforce this _Lot size_ manually (it requires a lot of hacks). So if you're lucky, when you run with _0.01_ lot size, that's great, otherwise, the backtest could be not as expected.

That's exactly I don't like it, different trade sizes 0.41 , 1.05 , which brings me an air of Martingale schema ...  
  
I agree with entering multiple times with a fixed size to build an aggregated position ...

I had reports that EA sometimes doesn't close huge profit on time (but it depends which version), so you did a good decision. Take profit is something that needs to be more optimized (but there is always dilemma like what-if you could get more). However, you may also setup the condition, to close the most profitable trades, once equity is above 10% or 20%

If you don't like different trade size, you can disable boosting section. However, boosting is another feature of EA which gives certain priorities to strategies once they're doing good, and minimalize lot size for strategies which are bad. It also gives EA to take short high-chance opportunities where given the past scenarios, it knows about good deals so it can trade with higher lot size than the average. It's good to compare backtesting results with boosting enabled/disabled and conditional-actions enabled/disabled.

As like now it closes a lot of trades with losses balance reduced by $200 or more   
  
YET the equity is $300 more than before. ( i have a feeling that it will go way higher ) lets see

In my case, I have disabled already the boost section and the back-testing took much good results than with the boost section enabled, less drown down and better profit factor ...

Something to note, that v1.072 is a bit riskier than the next versions, as v1.073 and beyond got new params such as RiskMarginPerOrder and RiskMarginTotal which limits a lot size to maximum % per order or available margin, which makes it more safer. v1.072 is good but in the long run, however, certain edge-case scenarios make it not able to handle big spikes. The workaround is to disable boosting, but then you may not have the same good results.  
  
Practical scenario, for example, RSI, CCI or any other strategy starts to produce good results making it profit factor above 2.0 (based on the perfect market conditions), and as result promoting it as the best strategy of the day, and of the week, multiplying your lot size based on the given settings (BoostTrendFactor/StrategyBoostByPF/BestDailyStrategyMultiplierFactor/BestWeeklyStrategyMultiplierFactor). Then, if something bad happens (like news report), you can end up with higher not expected losses. With RiskMarginPerOrder/RiskMarginTotal params (introduced in v1.073), the lot size is never open higher than your configured safety limits (like 1%-5% of your margin per order), no matter how good individual strategies are.

There is no single mq4 to download, it's a complex project with hundreds of files spread across multiple repositories, and it requires some effort and technical knowledge in order to compile it properly (this was all shared in this thread). I prefer to not attach any mq4 files, as they get quickly outdated, secondly, in order to avoid any abuse by potential scammers. If you can't download from GitHub, or you're not familiar with Git, you need to use provided EX4 files (which were already attached to this thread).

Of course not, it works for any broker. OANDA was just in my case, and OANDA can be replaced above with any other MT4 broker...

not a complete instructions. i figured if you changed it to portable you also need administration privilege everytime you need to open mt4 otherwise you cannot create any charts.  
  
now i cannot attached the ea. nothing happens. i wonder what more modification to mt4 needs to do first in order to attach the ea.

**/portable** means you can launch the MT4 app even from the **USB stick** , so no administration privilege needed at all ...  
  
In the **Experts** tab and additional in the **Journal** tab you can read the reason something is wrong ...  
  
  
So, I think your MT4 is installed in the **C:\** partition, the same partition as windows operating system. In this case, just copy the MT4 installation directory from **C:\** to **D:\** i.e.  
  
C:\Program Files (x86)\OANDA - MetaTrader\  
to  
D:\Program Files (x86)\OANDA - MetaTrader\  
  
OANDA can be replaced above with any other MT4 broker...  
  
and edit the **Target** entry field from the MT4 shortcut icon from the desktop in order to change only the first letter from **C** to **D** ...  
  
  
  
PS. In general, third party app should not be installed in the **C:\** partition, the same partition as windows operating system ...

Both. The main logic is based on the technical indicator data, however, there are some params which can adjust the logic on the tick level (such as TickIgnoreMethod).  
  
One of the problems with backtesting is that technical indicator data (OHLC) is already stored in HST files for the given candles (I'm not sure whether it is re-calculated on the fly during backtesting/optimization process per tick, or it is just read from HST per bar), in comparison when doing real-time trading, the technical indicator data (OHLC) actually changes on the fly multiple times for the same bar, which may generate not consistent results. By ignoring ticks with mentioned param, you can feed EA with some consistent OHLC values. But it's a matter of heavy testing whether it can improve the results or not, or whether backtest results are reliable at all.

No need to compile the **mq4** file, MT4 app compile it automatically if the **ex4** file does not exist (or it is old than the mq4 file) when launched ...  
  
You attached the **ex4** file to the chart, so the compilation process was successful ...  
  
The attached mq4 file skip the obsolete **CheckSettings** license validation and fix the Error (5053): InitStrategy: Cannot initialize indicator for the Envelopes M15 strategy!  
  
Just replace the old **EA31337.mq4** file and restart the MT4 app...

Edit ea-mode.mqh file and uncomment the line with __nolicense__ to activate the full mode.

To skip the startup validation, you can simply disable 'Validate startup settings' param (set to False). But it's there for the reason. If it fails, that means your indicator data is not there, so your backtesting result could be not reliable. Another workaround is to disable the strategy which fails.

Currently, v1.076 is not released yet (no ex4 files yet), so the code tagged with v1.076 is basically the same as v1.075. The tag was created for pre-release, so, for now, I've removed tag v1.076 to avoid confusion, but left branch v1.076-dev for the active development towards the next release. Therefore the current latest version is v1.075. I hope that makes sense.

So you say, that the technical data could be not available (yet) during _OnInit()_? From my experience, It is always available when I'm testing it. Almost never got these InitStrategy errors when all data is in place.

InitStrategies call skip all subsequent InitStrategy calls if a certain strategy fails during OnInit(), so the the _Envelopes M15 strategy_ which fails is the first and the last one which fails during OnInit() ...  
  
The next step for me is to obtain the full list of strategies which fails and after that to look if or not _the technical data could be not available (yet) during OnInit()_ for each strategy which fails ...  
  
Just checked, the _Envelopes M15 strategy_ is the only one strategy which fails ...  
  
Now look if or not _the technical data could be not available (yet) during OnInit()_ for the single one _Envelopes M15 strategy_ which fails ...  
  
envelopes[index][CURR][MODE_MAIN] = 0 is a valid value during _OnInit()_ so the _Envelopes M15 strategy_ also succeed (the technical data is available) ...

I don't think 0 value for [MODE_MAIN for iEnvelopes()](https://docs.mql4.com/indicators/ienvelopes) is the valid value. If it's zero, you can't be sure it won't be a zero during the test.

Given this [TestEnvelopes.mq4](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/blob/master/tests/TestEnvelopes.mq4) test which I've created, I've run [iEnvelopes()](https://docs.mql4.com/indicators/ienvelopes) during OnInit() in the container on [M15](https://travis-ci.org/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/jobs/370750572#L2880) and [M30](https://travis-ci.org/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/jobs/370750574#L2880) timeframes with all modes: MODE_LOWER, MODE_MAIN, MODE_UPPER, using MetaTrader 4 build 1010, and all return positive values (which I believe is correct). It is possible that MODE_MAIN was removed in [MT5](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/indicators/ienvelopes), however, I think it could the side effect after you've replaced the MT4 terminal.exe with MT5. Replacing just metaeditor.exe only for compilation purposes is enough. Although I haven't tested this in the latest build, but I think this should be back compatible as I don't think they can just remove MODE_MAIN from MQL4's iEnvelopes(). And I think the mentioned [article is mistaken](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1496) about not including MODE_MAIN.  
  
Result of printing MODE_LOWER/MODE_MAIN/MODE_UPPER (for M15, and same for M30):  
2016.01.05 01:00 TestEnvelopes EURUSD,M15: Envelopes M1 : 1.08147/1.08255/1.08363 => CORRECT  
2016.01.05 01:00 TestEnvelopes EURUSD,M15: Envelopes M5 : 1.08168/1.08277/1.08385 => CORRECT

Difficult to say, as EA is in active mode and it should work. Not sure how long you're running it, but the market pace is slow (40ticks/min), and not much is going on, so nothing is triggered. Another thing is to check, how many strategies were enabled during startup in your _Journey log_ , and make sure some weren't disabled due to some initial problems. Also, as far as I remember, v1.075 has fewer strategies enabled by default than previous versions or some of them could have too many bitwise filtering layers configured (such as _SignalMethod_ and _OpenCondition_ , but if you set towards 0 or 0 - it'll trigger more frequent trades) and it may not work for the current market conditions. This is due that I couldn't find the ideal optimization settings for some after some fixes and logic changes (as it takes a lot of effort), so I left for others to decide which they want to enable. If that's the case, enable more strategies (or play with SignalMethod/OpenCondition), however, it's worth to backtest them first. Otherwise, previous versions were configured differently.

Not normal for this EA when it's running in the healthy state, however, I already explained this in the simplest way as I could in post #123, but I think you didn't read it, as you're asking the same question in a different way. I've suggested you some actions to take, but it seems you come back with no further details. Have you checked the _Journal Log_ , how many strategies were activated, and so on, as I suggested? What else have you tried? Without full troubleshooting of the problem which may take some time, I cannot help you. Secondly, the project is provided as it is, however you are free to configure it according to your needs. Alternatively, you can always download the previous version's in EX4 format and try them instead and check the difference.

The ratio system uses M30 timeframe as the baseline, and it calculates different periods for different timeframes according to the provided ratio parameters (such as _Envelopes_MA_Period_Ratio_ & _Envelopes_Deviation_Ratio_), one reason, to avoid an overkill in the number of params (different period per timeframe). In order to fix the problem and use the same ratio for all timeframes, change Envelopes_MA_Period_Ratio & Envelopes_Deviation_Ratio to 1.0 (healthy range is 0.5-1.5). The reason why it has been set so low (_0.1_), was the result of the optimization system which for some reason "decided" it's better to set it so low, but couldn't predict the problems with the EA initialization. There could be two reason why the optimization system set extreme ratio values of ratio params for some strategies, either that configuration worked the best, or the opposite, to suppress the low-timeframe strategies from trading due to not able to find the ideal configuration. So if low ratios as 0.1 for Envelopes breaks the initialization process, the fix needs to be applied to the rules files used by the optimization system such as [Envelopes_MA_Period_Ratio.rule](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules/blob/master/Strategies/Envelopes/Strategy-Envelopes-All-Envelopes_MA_Period_Ratio.rule) and [Envelopes_Deviation_Ratio.rule](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules/blob/master/Strategies/Envelopes/Strategy-Envelopes-All-Envelopes_Deviation_Ratio.rule) (these are the rules used by other scripts). I'll apply the fix for the next time (e.g. to not go lower than 0.5 for Envelopes), when I'll be running the optimization process. I hope that makes sense. To summarize, you need to reset these ratios to 1.0 and re-run optimization which ratios would work the best for you.

It is still a low number of trades compared to previous versions. In the latest version (branch), only 11 strategies have been activated out of hundreds, because the optimization system couldn't find the settings optimal for the disabled one. So this is something that needs work. Not necessary the logic (which needs to be refactored soon), but the challenge is to find the best optimal settings (I'm using EURUSD 2015-2017 with spread 20 as the baseline)  
  
Unfortunately, I can't provide the best settings for the latest version (the default are the best to my knowledge and aren't perfect), as each change to EA's logic, all the tests need to be re-run and it requires enormous processing power to find its best configuration (at least few weeks with hundreds of instances running against different components/strategies, then running dozens of final-stage tests on top of that). For the optimization system, the following [rule files](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules/tree/master/Strategies) are used, around 200 rules, each testing different components of EA, sometimes running for days in a row, sometimes some needs to be re-run multiple times to re-adjust with other params.

1.072 is making lots of trades in my demo account. 2% plus in one day so far.   
  
In the backtest it only loses - equity curve going down to zero - which I don't understand.

Idem. More good results in back-testing when boost is off (fixed sizes 0.01 lots for example) ...  
  
The back-testing run with fixed spread, but the real/demo run win dynamic spread, so the results will be always different ...  
  
In the Asian session we have a huge spread, a case ignored in back-tests ...

To my understanding, backtests are very not reliable in MT4 platform by design. I think it's just broken on many levels and cannot be trusted. It requires a lot of hacks, but still, I couldn't find the reliable method.  
First, MT4 doesn't support dynamic spread by design (there are some hacks, but they may not work). For example, backtest result will get you smooth huge profits when the market is violate (that's the reason why this EA closes trades after 24h by default as for workaround to not rely on any advantages/lucks), in real trading, the broker will kill your profits with very high [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), or will keep re-quoting your orders during that "lucky" period.  
Secondly, when you set the current spread which is selected by default (it's not the same as dynamic, but fixed along the test), you'll get different results at the different time when you run it, so set it to 10 or 20 instead as for workaround.  
For the third, I still don't understand the significance of HST files during the backtesting, if this data is re-calculated during the test as the ticks flow (related post #110), but I believe they're not. If the technical data during backtesting is fed from HST files (technical indicator data) for the current bars (for "performance" reasons), that would be the worse (that's why I've implemented param to ignore some ticks to do some experimentation). In real trading, technical data changes as the ticks go.  
For backtesting and optimization, I'm using my own scripts for backtesting which aims to run backtest using more reliable methods, but still could be not reliable. It still needs some debugging to get more facts whether MT4 backtesting can be trusted or not at all.

Thanks.  
  
I know Steve Hopwood and friends make profitable EAs with no backtesting at all, they only use forward testing.  
  
Your EA with the set for 1.072 seems profitable so far on EURUSD.  
  
I have seen so called perfect backtests for EAs with 99.9% data and when put live they lose all the time.

unfortunately the EA does not work for me yet.  
  
But before I continue my search for errors ...  
  
Has the EA already been tested for several days on a demo / live ??  
How is the result?  
  
As already said, backtests can be a lie! I already had EA, which ran perfectly in the backtest. She had not survived a week on the demo ....

Good performance until now.  
  
I have it running on two different demo accounts with close at 1% with a basket manager.  
  
On the big account (~ 6000 usd) it was in a bigger drawdown but closed negative trades this morning and came out in plus. Very clever.  
  
On the smaller account (~ 1000 usd) it has given approx 2% per day.

Yesterday the profit was 703 USD on a 8000 USD account.  
  
Maybe the 1% close by the basket manager can result in a higher profit.

Can we compile the Advanced and Rider versions with the released source code?

Rider and Advanced modes got a bit broken along with improvements for Lite and the code needs some work. The idea is that Lite consist lighter/compact version of params included for simplicity (but it was changing, for example, v1.067 Lite got actions dropped, but at the end put back in v1.068, and other params were moved around to make some balance), another example, OpenCondition and MaxSpread values are hidden and hardcoded (based on some initial optimization tests) for Lite (see: [lite/ea-input.mqh](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/lite/ea-input.mqh)), but fully configurable for Advanced (see: [advanced/ea-input.mqh](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/advanced/ea-input.mqh)), Lite got up to 5 condition-actions, where Advanced got up to 30 along with some [Custom conditions on buy/sell and market condition](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L445). Advanced also introduces [CloseCondition](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/advanced/ea-input.mqh#L222) where you can decide when (under what conditions) the strategy orders should be closed (e.g., closing trades when RSI/CCI is low/high), where Lite doesn't have these features. _Advanced_ got also options to configure to not trade on high-spread market conditions (e.g. not trade on given timeframe like M1 or M5 when the spread is above XX). But given the fact that MT4 doesn't support backtesting with dynamic [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), there is no way to backtest these params. Then _Rider_ mode, is basically the extension of Advanced with the idea to trade long-term and share certain params for simpler optimization processes, like replacing _TrailingProfitMethod_ /_TrailingStopMethod_ in favour of _CloseCondition_ across all strategies, so strategies can react on certain market events, instead of using just trailing stops.  
I've been focused only on Lite version to make it polished (which isn't yet), and that was the only version which was released. There are some older version of Advanced and Rider which were compiled as working (e.g. v1.069). In terms of the recent code, these modes need several code fixes to keep up with them main code changes (for _Lite_) and need to be run through the optimization processes.

The current timeframe isn't taken into the account and it shouldn't affect the EA's performance, so you can run on any timeframe. EA is automatically operating on multiple timeframes between M1 and M30. However, for better visibility (and for backtesting), the suggested timeframe is M15 or M30

Hi kenorb, warm up period of 21 days, reminds me on neural networks ea. Is this the case here.  
  
PS. after dashboard eax this is most complex ea i have ever seen. Compered to this eas which are used in my ex company for portfolio management look simple.

Warm-up period is just to prevent large loses (especially with larger deposits) when EA is started on the unknown market. It is done by lowering the lot size to the minimum and slowly increasing, so it can give EA more flexibility. Secondly, in order to prioritize the strategies according to their success rate (profit factor). For the third, it shows whether the current settings work or not without risking more than needed. However, when started with a small deposit on a micro account, it doesn't make a big difference. Warm-up period is useful when the auto lot size is calculated higher than the minimum.  
The EA doesn't use a neural network. There are too many params which need to be optimized manually, where ConvNets should find those params for them-self. I'm aware there are already some EAs which are using it in MQL, but personally, I think the platform and its language structure isn't flexible enough to implement neural network purely in MQL (it's unstable, not open-sourced and too buggy). So I was thinking to use this EA only as a data feeder, then write some ConvNets in Python (or Rust), or/and make it talk to [Zenbot](https://github.com/DeviaVir/zenbot).

EA has not been tested with balances over 100k, like 4mln USD in your case, so it's just internal check. Although it should allow in demo, but not on real, so it's kind of bug. So please test it on the demo with less than 100k in balance. Otherwise, you'll have to modify the source code.

Based on your screenshot, you lost less than $5 out of $50000 balance in your demo account, so not big deal. Given the number of trades, that's actually a good result. You should wait a few days to see what happens.  
  
In your screenshot, you cut the second half of the screen (below "----" line), you should see which strategy generates the losses. However, it's best, if you wait few days. If one strategy get out of the control with loses, it should be suspended after a while.  
  
The behaviour sometimes is very inconsistent as some people report that v1.075 (see [post #122](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10996448#post10996448)) generate trades almost none, sometimes few trades per day ([post #128](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10996448#post10996448)) and you're reporting that it's generating too many trades. Unfortunately, I don't know the reason for that.  
  
Secondly, @chrisdk2017 and @shiva, are testing v1.072, you're testing v1.075, so the logic, optimized settings, SL/TP, and amount of trades, can be different.

Hi, can you send me settings which you are using? Please send it like *.set* file.  
I thing that there will problem with another parameter.

I just tried setting up 1.072 with correct set file at FXOpen and there I also get very small SL and bigger lots.  
  
Not sure why the SL is set so low when using FXOpen?

Small SL could be related to a low balance available (which is $1k in your case) given the calculated lot size (e.g. 0.03/0.05) and it is based on the calculated risk. For example, if your [RiskMargin](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/3fa8a7e67b6e8285c099f414daffeb8ecc13036e/src/include/EA/lite/ea-input.mqh#L46) is set to 1% (which is by default in v1.072), for the given lot size such as 0.05, EA overrides existing strategy stop-loss value with the "safe" limit (which can be too low for low balance accounts), in order to not risk more than 1% of your balance. You can increase RiskMargin to 5% (or 0 for auto) and see if that helps. Normally EA should first lower the lot size to the minimum, then calculate the risk, so that [logic for RiskMargin has been already fixed](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/commit/8f61d5628cdea6b9c58700b2bbb21b34d82aaec6) in the latest version which is calculated differently, so the old _RiskMargin_ was replaced with [_RiskMarginPerOrder_ and _RiskMarginTotal_](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/rider/ea-input.mqh#L52) (which can be set to 0 for auto). So as already mentioned, the workaround for older version is to either increase the account balance or risk margin param, or disable _boosting_ section for low balance accounts, or use the latest version which includes the logic fixes for better risk management.

The FXOpen account balance is $1k.  
  
Ironfx $1.5k and using smaller lots.  
  
Minimum stop is different (FXOpen = 0 pips, Ironfx 3 pips I think).  
  
Maybe the small lot at ironfx is caused by the minimum stop?  
  
The Ironfx performance is excellent, by the way. Maybe just pure coincidence.

It is also worth to note, that each magic number corresponds to the different strategy. So if you compare the same numbers, they usually share similar SL/TP values, so 31352 corresponds to (31352-31337=15) 15th strategy from the [ENUM_STRATEGY_TYPE](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.072/src/include/EA/ea-enums.mqh#L56) enum (counting from 0) which is most likely ALLIGATOR30, so comparing SL between two screenshots (200 vs 5 pips for the same strategy), these small stop-losses for M30 doesn't really make sense, so I believe the value was cut by risk params (most likely, not related to the different minimum stop). So, that difference of $500 in balance (and calculated lot size) in overall could impact the risk management logic how stop-losses (SL) were calculated, unless it's some other bug or factor which I'm not aware of.

The compiled version would work the same way. You need to read the error and post it, also make sure you're using _Full_ one, since _Backtest_ is only for backtesting purposes.

Thanks so much for sharing this EA, I'm having fun letting it run on demo for a few weeks here and trying to figure out how it works.  
I did have a quick question for you. How would I go about figuring out which trade method is associated with a certain magic #?  
I can view stats by magic # on fxblue, and would like to remove the only poor performing trade method in the near future.  
Thanks for any help!

Normally EA should report on the screen which strategy trades with (and daily/weekly/monthly stats which are the best and worse), sometimes it shows associated strategy to the order when hovering on the buy/sell arrow (MT4 is not always showing it for some reason), or comments (which is also not reliable).  
  
Otherwise, if you'd like to convert the order magic number to strategy, it's a simple math: _MagicNumber + sid_ , where sid is the strategy ID (sequential number starting from 0) defined in ENUM_STRATEGY_TYPE enum which can be found in [ea-enums.mqh file](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L41) (change tag according to your version in case the list is different).  
  
So AC1 is 31337+0, AC5 is 31337+1, AC15 is 31337+2, AC30 is 31337+3 and so on (despite AC is not implemented yet, but it's on the list).  
  
Basically, the magic number is assigned when the order is open for the given strategy (the signal is based on the bitwise filtering conditions which were matched), so EA knows how to manage it according to the strategy-specific params (even after restart it can continue where it finished). For example, when RSI30 is opened (31337MagicNumber+95sid=31432OrderMagic), based on its order's magic number EA can identify different strategies, so trailing TP/SL can be managed differently for each order accordingly to the associated strategy (e.g., what you've set for RSI and RSI30 specifically). Furthermore, each strategy knows on which timeframe it operates on based on its magic number (so it can view and analyse the market from the different angles), therefore each order can work independently and have its own logic when to open and close the position.

After each run (on exit or restart), EA generates TXT report file (this is also printed in _Journal log, but MT4 drops the lines_) in your _tester/files/_ folder (open via menu: _File_ , _Open Data Folder_). Once you open the file, it'll give you the list strategies and their success rate (profit factor). Based on this information, you can then decide whether you want to disable some strategies or just tweak/optimize them.

thanks for the quick reply!  
I have them all written down however I see some trades for strategies that I wasn't aware I had enabled?  
for example, I have magic numbers of 31381,31382,31383,31384 which appear to be 'Breakage m1, m5 and m15 and m30'  
also have 31407,31410,31412 which is gator and ichimoko  
How did those get enabled? my text file shows 17 strategies enabled, which I count correctly in my set file, however these aren't ones that should be trading.  
A little confused now ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I've checked and v1.072-v1.075 have the same list and numbers. So given this [link to ea-enums.mqh](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L41) , note the line numbers and that list starts at line 41, so:  
31381(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=85(lineNo)=(DEMARKER1); DeMarker-based strategy on M1  
31382(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=86(lineNo)=(DEMARKER5); DeMarker-based strategy on M5  
31383(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=87(lineNo)=(DEMARKER15); DeMarker-based strategy on M15  
31384(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=88(lineNo)=(DEMARKER30); DeMarker-based strategy on M30  
31407(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=111(lineNo)=(MA15); MA-based strategy on M15  
31410(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=114(lineNo)=(MACD5); MACD-based strategy on M5  
31412(OrderMagic)-31337(MagicNo)+41(start-line)=116(lineNo)=(MACD30); MACD-based strategy on M30  
  
I'm also attaching the list as the image (along with the line numbers in the file).

One of my accounts is currently sitting in 40% drawdown so I wonder if that is considered normal?  
  
It has reached the limit of open orders, so cannot trade more.  
  
This is the 6k account I mentioned before which is approx 10k now (in balance).  
  
Weird thing is another account with another data feed (different account type, but same broker, max orders 80 in chart) did not suffer from this drawdown, only 5% dd so far.  
  
The preset and ea is the same (1.072).  
  
Account with 5% dd has balance 1.6k now.  
  
Could be a broker thing (max orders=15 in chart), or because of the data feed, or a vps issue?

I know, it would be too good to be true to have 20-30% per every week.  
  
I think today something is going on. All cryptos went down for 10-20% within last 24h, see on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) (I'm mentioning cryptos, because this is what I trade currently). Probably everything else is also affected. For EURUSD I can see that the main trend changed (see H4).  
  
In terms of EA. It basically doesn't monitor for breakages from support and resistance (yet), but it tries to calculate the current trend in order to avoid for some strategies to not trade against the main trend.  
Trend detection has been introduced in v1.072 and since it's the new option for this version, could not work well. This feature can give the overview what's the current trend and how to trade with it. Although it improves performance comparing to the older versions, I've found later on that it really not work as expected and it doesn't adjust quick enough on trend changes, so this feature has been refactored in the latest version. In v1.072 version, the TrendMethod param is 113 set by default, but can be optimized (basically the higher, the lower timeframes are taken into the account, so the quicker EA can adjust to the trend changes, but you'll get more false-positive). The logic of [GetTrend() can be found in Trade class](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/488c10c210802985dd6c6fe4afa852ed264fc1ba/Trade.mqh#L399). It basically counting pull and bear candles and decides whether the trend has changed or not (it should be reported on the screen what the current trend is according to the calculation). This can affect all strategies since v1.072 as by default all signals method only trade with the current calculated trend unless signal method param for the strategy is negative. So most likely now EA trades against the trend because didn't notice the change yet as per current value for TrendMethod (it could think it's still bearish trend by comparing the whole branch). You can try to optimize _TrendMethod_ and find the optimal value, so EA will react quicker to the main trend changes. Code logic in v1.072:  
curr_trend = Market::GetTrend(fabs(TrendMethod), TrendMethod < 0 ? PERIOD_M1 : (ENUM_TIMEFRAMES) NULL, _Symbol);  
  
Based on above logic (counting the bars), I've found trend detection logic in v1.072 not working well, especially on trend changes (_TrendMethod_ param), therefore it has been rewritten completely to use just RSI method which is more reliable. Current code logic:  
double curr_rsi = iRSI(chart.GetSymbol(), TrendPeriod, RSI_Period, RSI_Applied_Price, 0);  
curr_trend = fabs(curr_rsi - 50) > 10 ? (double) (1.0 / 50) * (curr_rsi - 50) : 0;  
  
In addition, TrendMethod has been replaced with TrendPeriod.  
  
I'm not saying these DD/losses can be caused by only trend detection, as there are too many factors which can play role, but this is my first guess. Also, this can give you further details how EA manages the trades. I hope that makes sense.

Ok, makes sense - maybe the war in the middle east is causing this.  
  
Sitting on a lot of trades and then the trend changes, the account will go in big dd, a common ea problem.  
  
I tried to compile 1.072 with the current classes but some files are missing, Arrays.mqh, Backtest.mqh etc. Do you have a copy of the old files? I couldn't find them in github either.  
  
This was just to backport newest code to 1.072 to see if it behaves better with newest trend detection.

Each strategy trade function (Trade_X) got this line:  
result &= signal_method <= 0 || Convert::ValueToOp(curr_trend) == cmd;  
so when X_SignalMethod is 0 or positive, it only trades with the current trend. Otherwise, when negative, it trades all the time. The easiest would be to run optimization and find the better TrendMethod which works for the current months, as EA was optimized using older years (and the market is always changing). If you'd like to compile v1.072 (tag), you need to clone the main repo recursively and find the right HEAD for class repo. For example, if you go to [GitHub](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/tree/v1.072/src/include/EA) and you click on [public-classes @ 93f39c2](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/tree/93f39c2ce97364df221d981c4a4cba5d7e0504f6) folder, this is the version (93f39c2) of EA31337-classes files to use. Using git, you just checkout to that version (git checkout -f v1.072) and you should have the right files. But I don't think backporting will help, it could be not a simple change, but you can try. I think the easiest is to optimize the params one by one (starting from TrendMethod), or per group of params, so they can work better. Or find signal method values which can work despite the trend changes.

Unfortunately, losses play some role as well. So from 6k, you get 10k within 2-3 weeks with a bit of luck due to joining at the right time and trading along with the trend, only to prepare for the switch (or bad market conditions), so you can afford the losses which comes to the trend change. The risk is that the EA doesn't know whether the trend changed (nobody knows) as it also could be a false-positive. So by trial and error, the losses needs to be taken into the account, in order to adjust to the new market conditions. In the ideal scenario, you want to earn 2-3x more, then afford to lose less when the market goes bad. Successful trading comes with the right trend detection logic working well, otherwise trading lower timeframes against the main trend could be a suicide. Normally EA should detect the losses and take into the account, and lower the lot size to the minimum when the market conditions are bad (based on the profit factor per strategy), but it can take some time to adjust.

Thanks,  
  
It sounds a little complicated, maybe I can do it with a little spare time.  
  
Yes, I wasn't expecting the EA to handle a big dd with the current profits which was 70% in less than 3 weeks, which is pretty crazy. Once in a while I have no problem closing trades on a EA due to trend changes or market changes. It is just knowing when to do it. I closed the trades on the smaller account and it is up 42% including losses which nobody can complain about ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I wasn't expecting 70% in the first 3 weeks on the forward testing, that sounds very promising, so thanks for testing. Even with the loses, this still shows a great hidden potential. I hope it's going to continuing like that. I was mainly focusing on the backtests which didn't perform so well and they looked very unstable and didn't know exactly how to approach the problem due to limitations. As far as I remember, v1.072 was heavily optimized (update below), but my understanding is, the latest version of EA has been optimized only to its ~20-30% full potential and also needs some heavy optimization work, that's the reason most of the strategies were disabled by default. This month I can introduce to the method of backtesting using _Docker_ in order to attempt the optimization of the latest version.  
  
Here are the optimization results which were used for the EA, so it can give a brief idea how complex it is:  
\- [v1.072 part 1](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/pull/317/files) (combined results from 1084 commits) + [v1.072 part 2](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/pull/319/files) (combined results from 2281 commits)  
Assuming each commit approximately is one optimization (~few hours run each) or backtest run (~1h), it took over 3365 tests (the number could be doubled as not all were accepted to be merged, failed or needed to be re-run) to find the right parameters for it. Let's assume each run is around 1h (in reality, some runs took days in a row), it makes over 140 days which is like running optimization tests constantly for over 4.5 months in a row (24h/7).  
And here are the results for next versions:  
\- [v1.073 RC1](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/pull/320/files) (1508 commits/tests)  
\- [v1.074](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/pull/321/files) (327 commits/tests)  
\- v1.075 got only fixes and some manual optimization runs, no further optimizations are done yet.

I tried v1.075 with default settings for 1 week. I only changed trailing stop to 0. But there was only to much trades with bad results overall. Some part of history on picture. Next week I will try v1,072. Can you publish setting which you are using as *.set* file. Please !!!!!!!!

I looked in the commits for the optimization of v1.074 and CloseOrderAfterXHours is now set to 24 hours rather than 72 hours like in the set for v1.072. I am going to try that for the next weeks of forward testing.

The EA has been optimized only for EURUSD, it seems you're testing it also for GBPUSD and USDJPY, so I'm not surprised about the losses (looks like stop losses are too tight for GBPUSD). Currently, EURUSD is still the challenge, in the further versions I hope it's going to be optimized for other. So you'll need to optimize params for each pair separately, till then, try or post the results for EURUSD.

The _CloseOrderAfterXHours_ is a very speculative param. On one side, during trading you want to keep your order as long as it's necessary till you hit your stops (e.g., just in case the order gets better, or you get attached to it), on the other hand, during backtesting, you don't want to keep your orders too long to avoid few lucky trades poisoning your overall results.  
  
In general, the [optimization results for v1.073](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/blob/67b9680288fed9a145d7eccabfb5cc20608a9f18/EURUSD/default/10000USD/20-spread/5-digits/2014-2016/_optimization_results/All-CloseOrderAfterXHours--EURUSD-10000USD-2014-2016year-20spread-DS-test.txt) shows, the longer you wait, the better.  
Period 30 Minutes (M30) 2014.01.06 00:00 - 2016.12.30 21:30 (2014.01.01 - 2016.12.31)  
Model Control points (a very crude method)  
Initial deposit 10000.00; Spread 20  
Pass Profit Total trades Profit factor Expected Payoff Drawdown $ Drawdown %  
1 5963.88 4302 1.04 1.39 12027.22 72.10 CloseOrderAfterXHours=0;  
4 4548.52 5783 1.03 0.79 9646.13 65.65 CloseOrderAfterXHours=72;  
6 3970.98 5695 1.03 0.70 7842.83 51.07 CloseOrderAfterXHours=120;  
3 3285.71 6511 1.02 0.50 10278.19 66.28 CloseOrderAfterXHours=48;  
2 1001.18 8141 1.01 0.12 9911.01 70.30 CloseOrderAfterXHours=24;  
5 314.52 6091 1.00 0.05 10293.47 71.50 CloseOrderAfterXHours=96;  
  
And [another one for 2016](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/blob/67b9680288fed9a145d7eccabfb5cc20608a9f18/EURUSD/default/10000USD/20-spread/5-digits/2016/_optimization_results/All-CloseOrderAfterXHours--EURUSD-10000USD-2016year-20spread-DS-test.txt) (missing other values probably means they failed to provide positive profit):  
Period 30 Minutes (M30) 2016.01.06 03:00 - 2016.12.30 21:30 (2016.01.01 - 2016.12.31)

1 17370.37 1727 1.27 10.06 8451.76 44.77 CloseOrderAfterXHours=96;  
  
So for the forward trading, I think it's probably better to keep it 72h or 0 (for none), for optimization tests, to find the best technical params, it's better to keep it tight (like 24h) as the technical indicator conditions which were used to open the trade are no longer relevant the next day as support, resistance and pivot points changes, so the profit results from the next day should be not considered. On the other side, when you optimized params using 24h closure, you don't know whether you will improve or worse things when you change it during forward trading, because the change will alter the logic which hasn't been tested.  
  
Here is another [optimization results for v1.074](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-Lite-Sets/blob/59cac57bcce1efef5f389a0bfb7ef8311c8853a2/EURUSD/default/10000USD/20-spread/5-digits/2014-2016/_optimization_results/All-CloseOrderAfterXHours--EURUSD-10000USD-2014-2016year-20spread-DS-test.txt):  
  
Period 30 Minutes (M30) 2014.01.06 00:00 - 2016.12.30 21:30 (2014.01.01 - 2016.12.31)

2 -54.77 221 0.95 -0.25 338.19 3.36 CloseOrderAfterXHours=24;  
3 -54.77 221 0.95 -0.25 338.19 3.36 CloseOrderAfterXHours=48;  
  
So what's the best value for it? I don't know. But it's good to find out on the forward testing.

You don't know when the trend is reversed unless it's too late. Usually, it's done by checking whether the support/resistance is broken, but EA doesn't have such feature. So the only way is to optimize _TrendMethod_ and find the optimal value for the current year or months, so EA will react quicker, or as you say, close the trades manually.

There are results for EUR USD. Tight SL and extremely tight TP.

You've got like ~50/50 wins/losses with minimum lot size, so that's not so bad. Assuming these losses belongs to the specific strategy which doesn't work for the current market conditions, once it hit profit factor below 0.5, they will be automatically disabled, so you'll be left with the one which works. Try for another few days on the same run and share how it goes. The tight SL/TP depending on the strategy params, they usually depend on some other technical indicator values so it may vary.

With optimization on Main trend method I get 112 instead of 203. It goes from loss to profit in period 2017-present date. I used Alpari data which is supposed to be better than usual MT4 historical data.  
  
(this is for v1.072)

I have tried to optimize GBPUSD using v.1.075.  
  
Very little profits in the last few months, maybe that is just the nature of GBPUSD.  
  
But overall nice profits :-)  
  
from 2k to 48k 2013-present.

For CCI, is there a maximum value for the signal method?  
  
It just says "0-" with no maximum in the inputs. I looked through the source and couldn't find the information.

CCI was added in the recent version. The range for the signal method is between 0-63 as per the following code (in [Trade_CCI()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/EA31337.mq4#L2071)):  
if ((signal_method % 1) == 0) result &= cci[period][CURR] > cci[period][PREV]; # 1  
if ((signal_method % 2) == 0) result &= cci[period][PREV] > cci[period][FAR]; # 2  
if ((signal_method % 4) == 0) result &= cci[period][PREV] < -signal_level; # 3  
if ((signal_method % 8) == 0) result &= cci[period][FAR] < -signal_level; # 4  
if ((signal_method % 16) == 0) result &= cci[period][CURR] - cci[period][PREV] > cci[period][PREV] - cci[period][FAR]; # 5  
if ((signal_method % 32) == 0) result &= cci[period][FAR] > 0; # 6  
The conditions are implemented [bitwisely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) (logical AND operation). For example, CCI has 6 main 'if' conditions, so by checking 0-64 range, you can basically test all the permutations. So 0 (for CCI*_SignalMethod) means no filter signal conditions (that is every trade will be executed; high volume trading), '1' value means execute only when 1st condition is matched (CURR>PREV - current CCI value is higher than from the previous bar for buy, opposite for the sell), '2' - execute only on 2nd condition, '3' (1+2) - execute on both 1st and 2nd conditions, '4' - only on 4th conditions, '5' (1+4) only on 1st and 4th, '6' (2+4), '7' (1+2+4), '8', '9' (1+8) and so on, and '63' means all 6 conditions needs to be matched to execute the trades. This is very powerful, as you can test all the combinations for each timeframe and set the unique conditions for each strategy and each timeframe which works for the given market conditions (pair). In the later versions, new conditions can be added or the weakest conditions can be replaced with the better one.  
  
Based on above logic, here are the hints to troubleshoot the volume of trades for the given strategy based on its signal method (filtering system):  
\- if the strategy trades too often: increase or optimize its corresponding _SignalMethod_ param;  
\- if the strategy doesn't trade much or you want it to trade more often: decrease or reset _SignalMethod_ to 0, then optimize its value.

Thanks for the info.  
  
I think I am getting the hang of the optimization of the EA though the way I optimize is of course much simpler than the months of testing that you have described for the EURUSD set.  
  
I am first running it from 2014-2016 with everything enabled, then optimizing each type of signal (bands etc) and then combining everything to one set finally.  
  
The GBPUSD set took roughly one day of work so I guess you could find even better sets with more optimization.

Few hints on optimizations:  
\- I usually disable boosting (Boosting_Enabled=0) and actions (Account_Conditions_Active=0) when running optimizations, so you've pure technical results. Boosting and actions can be tested at the final test, whether they add some value on top of it or not.  
\- I also use CloseOrderAfterXHours=48, LotSize set to 0.01 and ProfitFactorMinToTrade/ProfitFactorMaxToTrade=0 specifically for the optimization tests (see [ea_default_sets()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules/blob/102493bd571deba7047f7223213ff98b10603017/Common/.init.rules.inc#L41)). So profits for orders opened after 2 days are not taken into the account, and lot size is not automatically increased with the balance, so you're relying on the very strict rules (all trades should be equal as possible, not dependent on the previous success or current balance).  
\- Above strict rules will not always give you the good results, only the right direction, but combining them with some later-stage params, they can hugely improve.  
\- Another benefit of setting fixed and minimum lot size (0.01), is that you want to open as many trades as possible (>1000), so you can optimize params based on the large dataset giving as much possible scenarios and different market conditions.  
\- I usually optimize each strategy on its own, then merge it with the others at the final tests when optimizing params which affects all strategies (see: [optimization tests for Strategies](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules/tree/102493bd571deba7047f7223213ff98b10603017/Strategies)).  
\- SignalMethod should be optimized only for the given strategy and its timeframe (in the isolated run, so every other strategy should be disabled), it's quicker and more reliable.  
\- If SignalMethod is too much filtered (less than <100 trades), that's sometimes bad, as you don't have enough dataset to optimize other params (in other words, the optimization results could be not reliable).  
\- Strategy-specific multi-timeframe-shared params such as Period_Ratio, SignalLevel, Applied_Price are tested after optimization of timeframe-specific param (such as SignalMethod).  
\- For very slow optimization tests, I use Control points to have some rough idea which value is better, but the results could not always be reliable.  
\- At the final tests, I test boosting on/off or/and actions on/off (or few specific actions), CloseOrderAfterXHours, RiskMargin, RiskRatio, RiskRatioDecreaseMethod/RiskRatioIncreaseMethod and similar.

Actually, the range for CCI is -63-63, similar for every other strategy (that is, not from 0, but from the negative corresponding value). So as [already explained](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11060574#post11060574) the 6 conditions, negative and positive numbers are basically the same conditions, but positives values trades with trend only, and negative values trades ignores the trend check. So 63 value means all 6 conditions need to match as well the trend need to match the type of order (buy for bullish trend, sell for bearish trend), where -63 will execute trades for all 6 conditions including trades against the trend. The trend logic is controlled by _TrendMethod_ param in v1.072 (based on bear/bull candles), and _TrendPeriod_ in v1.075 (based on RSI).  
For example, some strategies aren't really good at trading against the trend (such as Fractals, despite the conditions), so positive values should be set, some other strategies can work well when trading against the trend (like RSI). Including negative values, makes the optimization process twice as long.

Hi,  
This was the error encounter with V1.075 BackTest.  
There was no error for V1.072

There is some initialization bug in the latest version (related posts: [#126-127](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10996649#post10996649)) related to wrong default param values, to fix it, change _Envelopes_Deviation_Ratio_ param to 1.0. Alternatively, you can make Envelopes M15 not active, or set 'Validate startup settings' param to _False_. This is going to be fixed in the next version.

I notice you have -35% drawdown, about the same as I had on the [Ironfx](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile") stp account.  
  
I also suspect now that I have found the reason for the 200 pips SL on one account and very low pips SL on another account. I think it has to do with the minimum stop and the way trailing stop is set.  
  
On the ironfx abs zero account (minimum stop 3, no commissions), the account has a drawdown at 10%, profit 49% in about a month (1000 usd account). This is due to the 200 pips SL issue + basket closing at 1% that I have setup on that account. The EA is running with 0.01 lots.  
  
On FXOpen ECN + STP accounts (minimum stop 0) I had only losses with out-of-the-box v.1.072, so now I have disabled trailing stop and put the basket manager at +1%. And now it is making profits, though I will wait a couple of weeks to see if I can replicate the profits at the ironfx abs zero account.

The v1.072 needs some work on when to close the trades, as it could have over 300% in a week now, but it seems can't find the good opportunity to close the good flying trades. It had over $20000 of equity on $5000 account and could easily close it, now dropped to ~$17000, hopefully, it'll bounce up and close on time. Finger crossed.

All credit goes to you man! This is your EA. I've just loaded an optimized set file from the previous post and watched the magic unfold.  
  
Thanks again for sharing kenorb!  
  
Notes:  
1\. In backtest, EA blew the account in 3 months.  
2\. We can get a lot of rebates with this EA.  
3\. I'll post set file when I get home.  
4\. In live account tests, we might want to reduce the "minimum volume to open".

v1.072 is risky, as it has some trouble closing good trades on time, and managing a lot of open trades at the same time can jump your equity up and down. Huge drops when having too many trades opened at the same time can kill the account. That's why further versions got better risk management logic (such as _RiskMarginPerOrder_ and _RiskMarginTotal_ params), but not optimized so well yet.

Yeah, I also see the floating P/L is wild. I avoid meddling with it so that we can have better assessment of the EA's performance. We should give it a couple more weeks of testing.

Huge drops when having too many trades opened at the same time can kill the account. That's why further versions got better risk management logic (such as RiskMarginPerOrder and RiskMarginTotal params), but not optimized so well yet.

I really can't help with optimization as I have a crappy internet, so my data history is poor, but if it comes to forward testing, you can always count on me.

Orders closed with balance $17954 ([previous balance](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11068546#post11068546) when you posted: $11712). Looks good. Despite they charged you a lot of commission from these trades.

@kenorb  
are the changes you have already made in version 1.72 in Version 1.75?  
did you have a optimized set file for Version 1.75?

Would it make sense to add candlestick patterns as entry signals to the EA?

You can read [release notes](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases) for each EA's version what was changed, fixed or improved. Usually slight changes in logic (like adding params which affect all strategies) requiring re-optimization of the whole EA. Didn't have time to do this for v1.75 as it's requiring a lot of effort. I'm improving the optimization system, so it can make the optimization process easier (I'll share it soon). Basically, what was in v1.72, it's also in v1.75, improved, but needs optimization.

Make sense, added to the list. EA still got over 18 not implemented strategies in the code, such as AC, AD, ADX, ATR, Awesome, Bulls and Beare Power, Force, Gator, Ichimoki, MFI, Momentum, OBV, OSMA, RVI, StdDev, Stochastic, ZigZag and so on. Once they're finished (anybody can help, like finding the right conditions for them), candlestick pattern would be great to add as well.

Hi guys,  
  
Here is set file for EA31337 ver 1.072 Lite Full. I found this from the previous posts in this thread.  
  
TF = M15 / Pair = EURUSD  
  
Cross-checked with virtual hosting log.  
  
Only difference is that I set Risk Margin = 3.0

To use as comparison to others.

Thanks for adding, I've linked your explorer to this thread as well, hope that's fine. It's still not so bad after the hit last week, it's on the 5th position of the month (almost 4th), although 15th for this week, in comparison to 1st position of _zeramlakireg_ 's run (it hit the other competition very hard). Very interesting, wasn't aware of this _Leaderboard_ before. If _zeramlakireg_ 's explorer would be included on the monthly list, it would be on the 4th, but he joined too late.

Anybody could suggest me some good EAs with which EA31337 can compete with? So I can compare the results on the backtest results and have some point of reference when optimizing the new version. Ideally, something that can work for spread 10pts and above. Can be free, or not free, whatever.

Also, I've got some question about the commission, whoever can answer.  
Commission: -$5640.98  
Balance: $16319.80  
Deposits: $5000.00  
Does it mean EA suppose to earn $21319.8 in total, but out of which $5640.98 took broker? So it charged like over 25% of the earnings? High commission then. Wouldn't be more profitable to run with the spread broker? Or not? What do you think?

Hi ken,  
  
My broker offers 2 types of account:  
1\. No commission = 1.2 pip spread on EURUSD average  
2\. Commission = 0.2 pip spread on EURUSD average  
  
For 1 standard lot, I have a pip value of USD 10.0  
  
Since the EA traded 749.16 (crazy!!) standard lots this week, the total commission my broker took is about****:  
USD 1,498.00 due to spread (estimated)  
USD 5,640.98 due to commission  
USD 7,118.98 total  
  
In comparison, if I used the no commission account, my broker would get USD 8,989.92 (estimated)  
  
I used formula (spread x pip value (standard lot) x total lots traded)  
  
Cheers

I know of some good EAs with verified myfxbook performance:  
  
1\. MomentumEA - available in mql5 market, very expensive (USD 2,000), multicurrency, price action strategy, verified myfxbook  
  
2\. Filter Grid EA - has a free version, can work with single / multiple pairs, grid, verified myfxbook  
  
3\. You can also check Magix's thread (Lost Sock) here in FF, but please don't post backtest in his thread as it will definitely draw his ire.  
  
I'll try to look for some more.

I tested this strategy for this week on 50000 demo account. Open trades profit 4035 USD and closed trades profit 4393.  
Only I can say **_REALLY GOOD!!_**  
but only some problem with SL and TP, which are not the same on settings and on some open trades.  
Overall strategy looks very good and I am prepared to help with backtesting and forward testing if anybody needs help

Take profit/loss params could be confusing at the beginning, but most of the time these values are not taken into the account since each strategy has its own dynamic profit/loss param (it's overriding these defaults). So these params are only used when in strategy section you set _TrailingStopMethod/ProfitMethod_ to _Fixed_ or _Bi-way_ _:Fixed_. Basically, this acts like a neutral fixed starting-point which reads what-if profit/loss is 120/60, but at the end, the strategies find it least profitable so they override its value by its own thing. In general, each strategy has its own logic (controlled by params) when to set take-profit or stop-loss and they're not fixed, but dependent on the other technical indicators. For example, MA-based strategy can open the trade based on the value of _Moving Averages_ indicator, then take the profit when the price hits the upper line of Bands indicator, or hit the stop-loss based on another indicator like SAR or RSI (this is just the example, and this logic is fully configurable). There are over 55 combinations (each different method or indicator) how you can set your stop-loss or take-profit value dynamically, which makes 3025 (55*55) combinations in total how you can configure your stop-loss and take-profit per each strategy.

The first line of SET file should give you a clue for which version it's suitable. SET file can be loaded from the EA's settings by choosing _Load_ option in EA's _Inputs_ tab. You can search for it. Here is the [example](https://www.earnforex.com/blog/how-to-save-and-load-indicator-settings-in-metatrader-tutorial/).

Kenorb,  
Thanks for your EA. I would like to know what TF we are supposed to run the EA on, and what currency pairs are the best to run the EA on.  
Thanks

You can run on any timeframe, it should work the same way, as it's basically working on multi-timeframes at the same time. For backtesting, the suggested timeframe is M15 or M30 due to platform limitations/bugs. Currently, it has been optimized only for EURUSD (for now), but you're free to optimize for other pairs as well.

Check the [Installation of EA](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337#installation-of-ea) steps. If you got any error, check the _Journal log_.

You need to make sure you've tick data (FXT files) at least for M1 and historical data (HST) for all timeframes (at least from M1 and M30). See: [Backtesting in MT4](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Backtesting-in-MT4). Then use M15 or M30, as platform could not activate all timeframes when you're running on low or high timeframes due to limitations/bugs. If you still got the issue, post the error.

Maybe you should force load history or wait for market open.  
  
Not quite sure what that error is. Haven't encountered that either.

I believe you're using v1.075 (based on the Error 5006 which belong to the latest version). So if you're trying to load v1.072 SET file into v1.075 (based on the fact that posted SET file which you quoted was for v1.072) - it really won't work as the params are slightly different between the versions. In that case, you'll get the partial load breaking the whole logic. Secondly, when using v1.075 and you've got initialization issue, I've added a note to the [release](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/tag/v1.075) which params need to change (this was already mentioned few times).

These are just info messages, not the errors, they basically say the order suppose to be executed, but it didn't, as it would be too close to another one triggered from the same strategy (the safe distance is controlled by _MinPipGap_ value). Otherwise if _MinPipGap_ is set too low, you'll end up with too many similar orders. You can suppress these by disabling info messages. As far as I remember, I've lowered this kind of messages to debug type in the latest version.

It seems EA v1.072 isn't well optimized for the profit-takes, so if I were you, I would close in profit manually. Or at least few trades as you reached the maximum orders what EA can open. Otherwise, if you're just testing EA, leave it open.

Any time eurusd makes a move upward, the current setup on v1.72 takes a hit. So as long as the pair moves down with the trend all is well, as soon as it moves against the trend it takes a beating. From my observations for the last 30 days anyhow.

The problem with the older version v1.072 (such as _zeramlakireg_ account which got a lot of losses today) is how the boosting is applied, and not lowering lot sizes based on the risk and some flaws, which has been improved. One week was not enough to learn about market conditions and EA get too confident with its success rate by increasing lot sizes too much (I've described this in [post #85](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10990723#post10990723) and [#155 about warm-up period](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11028805#post11028805)), that's why warm-up period has been introduced to test the market conditions for longer period of time with minimal lots. Most likely, the perfect market conditions last week, set too high boosting values for successful strategies which didn't work this week. The secondary problem, lack of optimization of take-profit values. So v1.072 showed some power, but it seems it's not so optimized, and needs some work (ideally done on the latest version). Last week was exciting, but this week showed some flaws and just demonstrated how much further work needs to be done in order to find some balance. Most of the params are customizable, so it's a matter of time and good optimization.  
  
Another issue now is that the auto lot size is re-calculated based on the current balance at every week (see: [StartNewWeek()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.072/src/EA31337.mq4#L4118)). Since the big loss happened today on Monday, now EA will use larger lot sizes to recover the funds, so it's got a challenge now.  
  
For people, who would like to run alternative forward testing, you may run v1.072 without boosting feature enabled.  
  
It's also worth to mention, that each run is very unique, it has its own stats, progress and learning ratio. The longer EA runs, the stats are more balanced. For example, _zeramlakireg_ account was run only for one week, progress was too good, then next week was very bad, which was not expected. Where _tazmaan_ account suffered a bit fewer losses, since it was running for the whole month, so the stats are more balanced.

Thanks for this utility EA, it opened many positions which shows it is very active given the variety of strategies. |however, it closes 95% in loss as little as £0.02 (2p) which I find strange. Is is possible to program this EA to wait 10 pips in profit before trailing and this first trail to give 3 pips profit and lock this? If this can be achieved that means it'll close in profit no matter what.

Looks like some anomaly, didn't see this error before. Code logic is at: [GetAccountStopoutLevel()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/488c10c210802985dd6c6fe4afa852ed264fc1ba/Account.mqh#L411). The error doesn't make sense since your mode is 0 and there is a condition for that. I've added this to the bug list. This is related to [AccountStopoutMode()](https://docs.mql4.com/account/accountstopoutmode) MQL function (it's either 0 or 1). No idea. Could be also some platform bug, so try to restart it. Also, are you running it on the right currency pair?

The best is to identify which strategy is misconfigured via the order's magic number (see [post #174](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11041150#post11041150)), or stats, or by checking the generated report file. Then check the value of trailing stop for this strategy in the appropriate section, and re-optimize it.

Since most of the trailing stops rely on indicator values, in some cases when calculated values are too close to the price, the fixed stop is set (as far as I remember). In other words, for some trailing methods, the price needs to move up in order the valid stop loss can be set.  
But I think I've slightly misunderstood your question, so I'll answer it again.

If you wait for 10 pips in profit before setting trailing stop, that means you won't have stop-loss set till then, so it's introducing the risk whereas EA has the policy to always set a stop-loss, no matter what. In most of the cases, setting stops (SL or TP) too close to the price will generate the losses due to broker's [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") or commission. The EA aims to not be a scalper, but generating larger profits, but it's possible to optimize it as a scalper.  
  
If this didn't answer your question, please elaborate.

Thanks for your swift reply, would again look into this. I have an EA that sets its stop loss a bit wide to pave way for price flunctuation, it then waits for the price to move 9 or 10 pips and subsequently moves the stop loss from 200 points behind entry and place it 3 pips ahead of entry which secures 3 pips even if the price returns. This style wouldn't deplete your equity. Your EA is an advanced EA with user defined strategy. Please see if this style if possible for fine tuning or I would have to figure out what to do. I have disabled them on other pairs except eur/usd and gbp/usd. It is being used on my live real account while testing other pairs on my demo.

Now I know what you mean by locking. The EA has two type of trailing types: one-way (locked) and bi-way.  
  
Example 1:  
T1_10_BARS_PEAK = 5, // 10 bars peak  
T2_10_BARS_PEAK = -5, // Bi-way: 10 bars peak  
The first method will move trailing stop by a distance of highest price from last 10 bars, but only one way (along with the price, securing the profit). Bi-way is opposite, will move two ways (without locking).  
  
Example 2:  
T1_MA_S = 19, // MA Slow  
T2_MA_S = -19, // Bi-way: MA Slow  
The first method will move trailing stop by the value of _Moving Average_ indicator and will use the locking (can move only one way along with the profit), the second will move both ways (exactly how _MA Slow_ indicator will move).  
  
Each trailing method got its corresponding locked version. See: [ENUM_TRAIL_TYPE enum](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/blob/v1.075/src/include/EA31337/ea-enums.mqh#L273). I'll add _Locked_ term to the opposite methods of _Bi-way_ , unless you can propose the better naming to differentiate these two.

I have seen this before on FXOpen ECN and STP accounts. On one day the EA gave 10% loss out-of-the-box.  
  
Not sure why, it seems the feeds for EURUSD are very different on all the brokers I have tested on.  
  
EDIT: double-checked on two different accounts, one with lower balance gets higher lot size with same preset. I would call this a bug but hard to debug. <https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues/50>

The magic broke. It was very exciting last week, we beat all the competitions, unfortunately, I think the risk was set too high.  
  
You mentioned that you've increased _RiskMargin_ to 3.0, I think that's the main cause of the loss on your account.  
  
I've checked and v1.072 by default has _RiskMargin_ set to 1.0 (1%), and you've increased to risk by 3 times (3%)! So the risk was set way too high therefore the EA's lot sizes were calculated too large, and things went out of the control.

I guess risk margin 1.0 is per trade so actually the risk is 1.0 x number of strategies active. So basically risk is more like 7% when risk is set to 1%.  
  
Approx 1 month performance with 0.01 sizes on a 1000 USD account with basket manager closing at 1% attached.

You mentioned that you've increased RiskMargin to 3.0, I think that's the main cause of the loss on your account. I've checked and v1.072 by default has RiskMargin set to 1.0 (1%), and you've increased to risk by 3 times (3%)! So the risk was set way too high therefore the EA's lot sizes were calculated too large, and things went out of the control.

I will load the set file I shared as is and will replenish the demo account.  
  
Please let me know if there is another version optimized that is up for testing as I have one more free slot in my VPS.

Many thanks for your help, I have done the trailing stop but this ea is losing 98% of the trades, please check the two log files (21st May & 22nd May attached. Maybe it'll give a clue as to where the problem lies.

It is the standard set file for 1.072 but I suspect the lot sizing could be caused a bug  
  
<https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues/50>  
  
You could try to set lot size to 0.01 to replicate my results

I have attached the log files for yesterday and today in the attachment.   
I was also reading somewhere about set files, I am using version 1.75, do I need set files, and if so, where can I get them? Maybe that's why its losing the trades.

You should use it only on EURUSD, as it hasn't been optimized for the other pairs. As far as I understand from your logs, you've tried to run it on over 10 different pairs. For different pairs, you'll have to use different SET file (alternative one were shared in this thread). Or generate and provide your own, so other can test. Currently, the EA works per single pair which was optimized to. And all existing versions and their default settings were optimized for EURUSD only. Maybe in future versions, we can make it work on multiple pairs, currently, it's designed to work only one specific one. Basically, the settings need to compatible with the market that you're running on.

No other set files apart from the default settings which have already embedded the best-known settings. You can optimize it on your own, or wait for the new set files, or next versions, to test the new improvements.

Thanks for the logs, I'll check them in details. However, there is not really any problem, the EA logic works as expected according to the configured params (which you haven't change I guess). I'm not advertising it as profitable (it all depends how much it's optimized for the given dataset, how you're using/running it, on what market, what broker, [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")/commissions, leverage plus your trading knowledge, luck and hundred of other factors). In general, your outcome is tied to your time and effort you put into it (every run is unique and without understanding all the factors, you'll always fail). For sure it requires some work and optimization (as everything else), so please use it at your own risk. It's basically not perfect and it won't be. It's a powerful tool given for free (including the source code; it's one of its kind) with billions of billions of combinations and permutations fully controlled by the user according to his needs. The only missing part is to understand how it works and the ability to optimize it well (this is all that you need). You can also use it as the engine or framework, so you can configure your own unique way and/or develop new strategies which can be managed by the main algorithm.  
  
I'm aware that people expect something profitable and working out-of-box, and for free, with their minimal effort spent. That is not the case. The EA basically comes as it is, and it still requires a lot of work which can take further years (it's basically ongoing never-ending development process). In other words, there is nothing to blame, you just need good settings for the given pair and market conditions that you're running on and some awareness what's going on, so you can keep adjusting it to your needs. If you find the perfect configuration that works great for you, that's great, share it. But you need to put some effort into configuring it according to your needs. Therefore I won't be able to help with the losses when running on some random pairs unless you find some specific errors/bugs or logic flows within EA itself or propose the new improvements, so they can be considered.  
  
That's how Forex works. As one week you can win 250%, another lose (as we've seen). The challenge here is to find the balanced params. Nobody found the holy grail yet.

Thanks bruv, I've always appreciated your benevolence at giving away such powerful tool. We'll together share knowledge about settings and issues and hopefully get it perfected soon. Would continue to tweak and revert with progress. Many thanks.

I am still trying to figure out how to use this EA. It would be very nice if someone could just post one mq4/ex4 of latest version along with OP recommended settings. From there further testing would be much easier.   
  
I know this have been asked and provided before but I tried that method and didnt work for me. Guess I am just a noob.

I agree with you, we can always improve on someone else's success. Everyone needs to post any preset which they have successfully tested and others can improve on their success.

Possibly, does it work for EURUSD pair, not EURUSDc? Can you reproduce this issue constantly? Does it happen only on the cent pairs? I've created [a bug here](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues/49), but I need more details. Can you attach your log file or report file? Can you test whether any other EA can work on the same cent pair?

Can you post the report files instead? These are text files generated after each EA run, so you should have few of them in your files/ folder within your platform. These can give more details about your trades.

The files which you're requesting were already posted few times. You can always click on the attachment icon of this thread on the top to see all the files that were attached. For EX4 files, check the [post #6](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10981835#post10981835) (v1.075) and [post #9](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10981913#post10981913) (v1.072), for MQ4 files check the posts [#91](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10991367#post10991367), [#112](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10994888#post10994888), [#118](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10995368#post10995368), but if you're a beginner, this will only trigger more questions than it answers. Also, saying something didn't work is very ambiguous as you didn't share what you've tried so far and what problem you're having. If you've got any specific issue, please post the details.

Hi everyone first post!  
  
I just wanted to say thankyou kenorb for all of your complex hard work that has gone into this project.  
  
I've had a little play and today dove straight in!!  
  
$1100 loaded into a live trading account with the files and version from this [post #9](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10981913#post10981913) (v1.072) on MT4 latest release.  
  
It's been running 1 hourish so far current result is -$32 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f605.png?v=15.1)

For anyone interested in it's progress i've linked Trade Explorers to the currently running live trading account with **EA31337 ver 1.072 **under my profile.  
  
I'd link it here but unsure of the code to use like others have above.  
  
Also, is this error an issue?

Which broker?  
  
Try turning boosting off.   
  
Fxopen has this issue, I solved it turning all trailing stop and trailing profit off. Not sure why, but eurusd is not just eurusd. Eg just because an ea has been optimized using dukascopy eurusd data doesn't mean it is profitable on all brokers.

This is the information message, not the error, telling that you've reached maximum 'open and pending orders', based on the calculated limits for your balance. So the EA is driving on the full force. In other words, EA would like to open more orders, but it would be too risky given the calculated risk (such as balance). You can disable info messages if you wish, but it's not recommended.

I wish you luck, however, if you're running v1.072 with the default settings, it's a bit unpredictable, as we've seen on the demo accounts. One week could go well, another not. Secondly, your performance also depends on the broker. If your [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are too high, EA could generate the losses instead, so you should investigate first on the demo. It would be good if you can backtest it using your broker data for the latest few months and adjust for your needs.

Which pair you're testing on? Can you post the report file from your files/ folder of your MT4 after EA run? Can you paste the screenshot of the EA screen while running?

Thanks for the reply kenorb!  
  
Gotcha regarding the system message!  
  
1.072 has been a wild and wooly ride for sure!   
  
It tried all manner of things to tweak the settings, the main issue i couldn't work out is that it would buy and or sell positions but never close them, ever! Hah, my screen looked amazing i gotta say!  
  
What version would you recommend and appropriate set file?  
  
I could give back testing a go why not.

If you disable trailing profit you need to close manually or use a basket manager to do so. Without boosting closing at +1% works.  
  
With boosting I would close manually since I have seen +50% profit in one go :-) Pretty crazy, yes.

Your calculated lot size 0.04 is higher than the minimal one due to your account leverage (the logic of [lot size is explained here](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues/50#issuecomment-391126755)). Since the market isn't in your favour, you get losses.  
  
Another thing, we can read from these lines:

That you didn't have enough trades to calculate the proper _profit factor_ (all are 1.0), you need at least 10-20 for each. So each strategy just barely traded, so EA doesn't know which one is successful. Secondly, it seems that you're like restarting EA every day, as you've send the report files for every day (whereas this file is generated only on restart/quit), with different amount of strategies enabled each time, so I think this is not going to work well. Currently, EA doesn't support loading the previous stats from the previous run, each time when you run, you start from scratch.  
  
If it's not you who restarting it, maybe your VPS keeps restarting?  
  
My suggestions: You need at least one week of the constant run, to know whether EA works for you or not, so the stats for strategies are populated properly and their profit factor (success rate), so it knows how to prioritize them. Since your account leverage is high (1:400), especially for such low balance, you'll see more losses in shorter amount of time if the market conditions are not in your favor, so you either need to lower your leverage (on your broker site or by contacting them), or set the lot size manually to 0.01 (instead of 0), so you can give more time for EA to adjust to the market conditions with lesser losses. If after a week, you still got the losses comparing to the other accounts, share the report files again, so we can see what we can read.  
  
\----  
  
Also, you've very low ticks per minute on your broker.  
Ticks per min (avg): 105  
Ticks per min (avg): 47  
Ticks per min (avg): 37  
Like something is wrong with your broker data. Not sure why. These values are usually over 200 on the demo/real run, especially on high-volume pairs such as EURUSD.

first thank you!  
reconnect:  
Can it be related to the fact that I once swapped the version or changed in the EA settings! Will these logs be created as well?  
Unfortunately, I can not comment on the number of ticks. ... I will do this for a week now with these settings and then we'll see!  
Many thanks for your effort!

Using zip alone, you won't be able to compile. Ideally, you should clone the repo recursively, then those submodule folders would be populated. See also [post #91](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10991367#post10991367) and [Compilation](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Compilation) steps (you need to install Git first). If the steps aren't clear, raise the issue at GitHub, I'll try to help you.

So I just placed v 1.075 in experts and started it and it gives below error, Am I missing any files? Sorry if this is a repeat question but I would really like to test this EA but I am having hard time starting it. Usually one just needs to place EA on chart and done, I am not sure what am I missing here.  
  
and 1.072 errors attached as well.

Yeah, your EA is crazy!  
  
I think I'll look for an EA to lock profits like what chrisdk2017 is doing to prevent profit leak. E.g. When Floating Profit reaches 10%, EA will lock 5%.  
  
I will do this test in another account; won't touch the TE Account to further evaluate the EA.  
  
Cheers!

Yes, this makes the profits more stable as you can see from this screenshot where it is closing at 1%.  
  
(I closed manually once where the red bar is shown).  
  
I am testing in another account where I manually close once in a while at a profit level a bit above 1% because boosting can give crazy profits in one day to see if there is a level above 1% that is more optimal.

The v1.075 version doesn't support balances above 100k, as it hasn't been optimized, so try with the lower balance please. Initiation error was mentioned a couple of times. It was mentioned a few times already here, I've increased now the size of the text note on the [release page](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/tag/v1.075) , I think I can't make it bigger now. I'll try to re-compile the older version with the param fix, but it won't happen soon. If you've got another issue, please raise the ticket.

Phenomenal EA. I started it on 21.5.18 with 1,000 on Demo and so far I'm 50% in profit with 475 in floating profit. Initially when it started, it was down to 800 but then recovered and looking positive so far. Great job on the EA. Hope to trade it on a live account after I test it for a month or so.

Everything is in the git repository. This was explained already in the first couple of posts, so please re-read as people had the same problems. If you carefully follow steps from [Compilation](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Compilation), and you clone the repo with \--recurse-submodules, you'll get all the folders populated, then checkout the v1.072 tag (git checkout v1.072). Then create symbolic links or copy these folders into appropriate places (MT4 include folder). If the steps aren't clear, create a new GitHub ticket. I won't be able to upload, as these files are constantly changing depending on the version you're trying to compile, so it'll be just more confusing and I'm sure you'll get into further problems, so the only way of managing these files is using Git. Secondly, the full sources were already uploaded into this thread, including these folders, so just check the attachment list of this thread. In case you've got these folders right, and you're missing only a few files, then you need to make sure you're using the right version of the class repo.

There are no settings for the specific timeframe, EA works on M1-M30 at once. When backtesting, you need to provide HST data for M1-M30 timeframes as well. Backtesting and forward-testing could produce the different results. Can you share the report file generated by EA in tester/files folder after the backtest results you've run, so we can troubleshoot? And I can compare with my results.

Can you share the report file generated by EA in tester/files folder after the backtest results you've run, so we can troubleshoot? And I can compare with my results.

That's the one, but it's between 2018.04.12-2018.05.24, not 2018.03.01-2018.05.31, still fine. I can't see any issues at the first glance.  
Few notes, you've got 66 ticks per minute in average, so it's like one tick per second which is low comparing to the data which I've used for optimization, but probably it shouldn't matter, not sure.  
Another thing, your account has quite low leverage (1:50), especially for such small deposit, so $2468.14 is required to open one lot (which is a bit high), therefore after calculation your account could only open 2 orders per strategy (25 in total), which is not a lot and could affect the results. Basically, EA was optimized with the minimum of $2000 deposit with at least 1:100 or 1:200 leverage. So having low leverage for such small deposit could make the negative results especially for such leverage, as EA didn't have enough flexibility and opportunities to open the successful trades (by trial and error). My suggestion is to try to backtest it again with the higher leverage (like 1:100 or 1:200) and see if you'll get the different results.  
For the next versions, I'll have to test the accounts with different account leverages and see how can affects the results. I'll compare your results with my configuration this week and let you know.

and another is 1 :200  
but stil negative result >.<

Hi there, i'm new to forex, just started like 3 months ago, i'm testing your EA version 1.072 today with the optimization given from this thread (EURUSD), looking good so far . I've been trying out the latest version, 1.075 but it wont trade, for hours the indicator appear but haven't been able to trade, do you know why? and my question is, is it safe to just use the version 1.072? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Some stats from different brokers and account types:  
  
FXOpen STP: 38 ticks per min  
[IronFX](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile") standard: 87 ticks per min  
IronFX Abs zero: 516 ticks per min  
IronFX STP/ECN: 478 ticks per min  
  
I don't think there is a general correlation ticks per min with performance (IronFX STP/ECN has 43% max dd) but maybe it does factor in some how. Best performance so far is IronFX abs zero (10% max dd).

From 10k to 30k with only 34 trades in 4 days? Lol.  
Consecutive wins 17 vs only 1 loss, secondly first time I see such a high profit-factor: 1913.

My FXOpen STP account was blown today.  
  
Though it could be because I set trailing stop and profit to None (otherwise it would just lose 10% per day).  
  
So the EA doesn't work there with the 1.072 eu preset.

With Dukascopy dataset, I had 570 ticks per minute for backtesting. Lesser tick data theoretically shouldn't make the difference, but it could be actually opposite.  
There is a _TickIgnoreMethod_ param (logic in ShouldIgnoreTick()) when it is set to a positive value (range: 0-5), it ignores certain ticks. The results should be similar, but they're not.  
  
For example (full test results in the attachment):  
Profit Total trades Profit factor Expected Payoff Drawdown $ Drawdown %  
10616.63 959 1.25 11.07 6384.50 43.76 TickIgnoreMethod=0  
7434.37 805 1.29 9.24 5797.92 42.78 TickIgnoreMethod=1  
2688.45 584 1.12 4.60 6466.84 49.67 TickIgnoreMethod=2  
2620.59 558 1.12 4.70 5892.46 42.23 TickIgnoreMethod=3  
  
Where 0 value means all ticks, 1 - ticks on open bar, 2 - open, low and high ticks only (OHLC), 3 - one tick per bar. So higher number of ticks can produce 5 times better results for backtesting. Why is that, I'm not sure. Possibly EA can catch more opportunities/trades earlier when there are more ticks (as indicator values can be wilder), but this needs some analysis. So for further versions, it would be better to get away from relying on ticks data, but standardize the input by going towards candle analysis (HST), so the input data is more consistent and easier to optimize.

That means you're lack of proper data for these dates. Testing on the broker data isn't reliable, as there could be too many gaps and low-quality data. You set testing from 01.03, but your data starts from 12.04, you want to end on 31.05, but your tick data stops on 24.05, so you can't rely on this.

1.075 got fewer strategies enabled due to some optimization issues, so it trades less often compared to 1.072. You can always try re-enabling strategies which were enabled for 1.072 and see if that helps.

Based on the feedback so far, I'll need to carefully review all the changes done to the further version to make sure the logic hasn't been broken, to make sure the issue is only about the optimization.

You can lower _RiskMargin_ param to _0.5_ (0.5% per trade), alternatively _RiskRatio_ to _0.5_. Also, try to lower _BoostTrendFactor_ param to _1.1_ or _1.2_. Another way, to keep the lots to the minimum, is to disable _Boosting_ section. These changes should generate smaller lot sizes.

Yeah, Im also just holding back from going live until I have a few months worth of data. Will probably test first on a live micro.  
  
I'm using the default settings on my multicurrency TE but reduced the riskmargin = 0.1 per pair so it trades lower lots.

Lol, crazy. Did you change any settings? You trade also manually or leave it full auto? 

Anything above the line is an uptrend, below the line is a downtrend.

It's running on full auto, but will probably look for an EA to close all position every Friday as I'll be changing my pairs every week.

I see everyone is posting nice results but when I do back test it blows up in the dirt. I can't figure out what am I doing wrong. I used the Set file shared by Impash. Below is 1m and 15m test on EU since January 2018.  
  
Settings I used are same posted by impash

In my opinion, all 90/99% backtesting (where data is converted using old unsupported scripts) provides just fake and unreliable results (used commonly by people who're not aware of wrongdoing or by the scammers) and I believe most of the EAs are backtested in the wrong way, but the majority believes it's the right way, that's why all of them struggling to be profitable despite showing the perfect curves. In one screenshot you've got 22 mismatched charts errors, these are the data errors (this should not happen), and since you've set the files to read-only (I assume), the platform doesn't have the ability to correct the errors. What you see in nice green bar - 90%, it is the fake value hardcoded by the script in FXT file (that's why you was asked to set the file as read-only, I believe). If you drop the read-only flag, most likely the files would be wiped out by the platform and marked as the corrupted and platform simply won't run the test. Same for the screenshot with _n/a_ (platform is confused by the invalid value which you're trying to force). These all forward-results just showing it's most likely the truth. For more explanation, check [post #22](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10982286#post10982286). Basically, I'm using completely different scripts for optimization and backtesting on which I'm relying on (which now I'm convinced even more, that my method is more reliable than the common FXT-read-only aka "99%" modelling method). Check the steps described on '[Backtesting in MT4](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Backtesting-in-MT4)' page which I've written which uses the more reliable method (which uses ready-made FXT/HST files or use the Python scripts). I'll soon share the easier method for backtesting.

So in short I should forward test and nope I didnt select any read only option but okay will test forward on demo. Thanks

The EA is using different approach for TP/SL comparing to other EAs which is by using dynamic indicator values per strategy-basis (e.g., see: [post #258](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11083366#post11083366)), so there is no auto, or single TP/SL param to change, but multiple places. TP/SL are set in form of trailing stops per strategy. The default settings are the recommended one unless you can optimize the better one. To change TP/SL, you need to find the strategy of your choice in the list of params (grouped by sections), then adjust it. If you need to set the fixed one, there is _Fixed_ value as well (but it's not recommended). So there are no auto values for TP/SL, just default settings based on the optimization results.

I've already shared the set file for EURUSD only TE. Just look it up in the attahments (paperclip icon on top of the page).  
  
The mql market has a lot of EAs doing 1,000% daily in backtests but will blow your account in a couple of days (even hours)!  
  
So, don't trust your backtest/optimization if you are not kenorb. XD  
  
Just forward test the EA.  
  
Also, don't expect other account's performance to be replicated in yours. You will start forward test in a different market condition and your account history (where the EA bases its lot sizing) are different.  
  
Cheers!

Yeah I am not expecting same results right of the back but I did not expect this big of a open loss and it was even bigger than that. I think I am gonna wait until someone finishes proper forward testing and author makes necessary changes after feed back. For now this EA is not ready for live account and others are doing forward testing already so I will just wait.

Personally, I forward test an EA to be familiar with how it trades. Especially how it opens the lot size in relation to my account size. We have different brokers, leverages, capital, risk tolerance, etc.  
  
IMO, if you have not forward tested an EA in demo using your prefered broker, leverage, and capital which you plan to use live, don't even go live with any EA.  
  
Edit:  
Regarding backtesting ver 1.072, I was not able to find any range of date where the EA was profitable in my backtests. It always blew up the account. I used 90% data quality with no mismatches. Yet, the result of the TE is drastically different.

I don't think you can get a low open dd with this ea due to how it trades many strategies at the same time.  
  
So yes, it is risky, big reward means big risk, which so far cannot be avoided.  
  
If you want low dd means you need single trade eas IMHO.

Your lot size is way too big.  
  
Set it to 0.01 for per 1000 USD / EUR.   
  
The problem is that the initial lot size calculation is using the account leverage.  
  
Maybe also turn off boosting.

I think people are too much focusing on the old version, keep running the same default configuration over and over again without changing anything, then they see the first week to be very profitable (then other people are panicking to follow the same), then the next week goes wrong and everybody is blaming EA. Unfortunately, the v1.072 with its default settings isn't balanced out, and it's not suitable for live and it was already mentioned (at least not with the default params). If you'd like to avoid high lot sizes, try at least turning off the boosting, then try again.  
There were several fixes improved in the further versions, it may not give you 100% a week, but it aims to be more balanced.  
  
For example, can anybody test the next version, which is the v1.073? It trades over 10 times less often than v1.072, but the logic should be very similar. Also, v1.073 was optimized and tested on the larger dataset (2014-2016, instead of 2014-2015). I'm attaching the backtesting results to compare v1.072 vs v1.073.

Note re above chart: Before you say there is a drawdown in the middle, it is not exactly, as the equity graph rocked up (the ticker line) and the EA could potentially hit the higher balance, but it didn't close on time.  
  
Here is another chart for v1.073 with spread 10:

\----  
  
Few notes:  
\- v1.072 got max 9401USD (30% DD) in the drawdown in 2 years, and v1.073 got only 4601USD in DD in 3 years, which is two times less (so safer to use).  
\- v1.073 trades 13 times less per year (642/3y=214 vs 5829/2y=2914.5), so that means you don't waste your money into broker's fees/[spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") or/and commissions.  
\- [Expected payoff](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1486) is 2 times higher for v1.073 (6.71 vs 3.25).  
\- Please note that above 2 charts are for spread 20, which is very high (most of EAs are tested with 10 or less). If you've got lesser spreads with your brokers, profits can potentially double, as you pay less to the broker.

All release files, like v1.073 got all the latest optimized params embedded into the source code, so the compiled version comes with the default best-known params out-of-box. So I don't have any extra/better SET files on top of it, than the default params.

Isnt latest version 1.075 ? Why do you recommend 1.073 over latest?  
  
Also the back tests you ran were those on Mt4 ?   
  
What settings you used in your backrests was it standard or did you change a single thing then we must know it to test it.   
  
Thanks

The v1.075 is trading even lesser, as it only few strategies enabled as it was aiming for the tests with even higher [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") (like 40, but then optimization system disabled half of the strategies), and people start complaining it doesn't trade for hours, secondly, it got a small startup init issue so people are a bit confused how to use it, so probably it needs more work. On the other hand, since few first posts, people got excited about 1.072, so moving to 1.073 is the less drastic change for now, so we can compare the results, understand the weaknesses and move forward. I don't know the versions beyond that (can't find the full backtest for 1.074), I'll have to dig the tests or re-run, but further versions weren't optimized after the logic changes/improvements, so they may not work well as good as the previous one with the defaults. I'll provide soon the backtests for all the versions so they can be compared.

Furthermore, it seems v1.074 got some issues, as only 3 type of indicators are enabled by default, and out of 5 strategies (Envelopes M15&M30, MACD M30, RSI M15&M30), for some reason only one (MA M15) was profitable. The results are still good, but something went wrong during the process. So I'm attaching backtest for v1.074 for 2015 which I've found, as can't find any for the other years. Of course, you can re-enable the other ones manually using params which you like and test.

Profit trades (% of total) 86 (32.33%) Loss trades (% of total) 180 (67.67%)  
  
Still isn't bad as for only one strategy (other 4 not profitable), so I'm not sure exactly what went wrong. It probably requires optimization of all the disabled strategies and re-enabling them. Please also note that the above test is for a low deposit of 2k USD, not 10k as previous ones (so it got less flexibility), and high spread of 20 points.  
  
Then v1.075 got only logic improvements and fixes, no optimization has been done, probably that's why it doesn't trade often (as per above). So it's on the current todo list.

Yes, these tests were run using MT4 platform run under Linux Ubuntu using automated scripts. Exact details of the dataset which was used to run the tests are also embedded onto image (period, how many ticks/bars and the result it-self).

The provided backtest results are just running EX4 it-self (no any external SET files were loaded) after the final optimization process, in other words, the default params were used for the given release file which are basically the best-known optimized params embedded into the binary.

a) on SVSFX demo account, when I enable the EA, it open the trade Sell and Buy on my MT4  
b) on [IronFX](/brokers/ironfx "View IronFX Broker Profile") demo account , when I enable the EA, it only open the SELL  
c) on [FXTM](/brokers/fxtm "View FXTM Broker Profile")-cent demo account , it only open Sell trade.

Some strategies are set to trade with trend, some aren't. Check the [trend detection description in post #178](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11051153#post11051153) and [#180](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11051636#post11051636). So possibly different strategies are triggered on different brokers, but you'll have to compare the [magic numbers](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11041150#post11041150), which are probably different. There are hundreds of factors taken into the account (like conditions and filtering systems in place) which are affecting how EA opens the trades, like slight price differences between brokers can trigger different conditions, also account balance/stats, broker spreads/leverage, existing orders, calculated lot size, free margins, slight delays, and many other factors could trigger different trades. You can also take the screenshots of the screen and compare the differences, or compare the initialization and trade logs which can give you more information. Another way is to enable debug messages.  
Basically, each run is unique and difficult to predict why certain trades are triggered, and other not on different brokers. This will require a new feature focusing on it and logging that kind of things. Normally without any filters, EA could potentially receive hundreds of buy/sell signals per minute, and logging such data, such as why certain orders weren't triggered, it can only slow the EA and generate very huge logs.

Very pity. This version of EA was optimized for 2014-2015, so 3 years behind, as it was released in December 2016. So it doesn't take into the account bad situation happening in 2017 and 2018, that's probably why. It needs to be fully re-optimized. I can help with the optimization process.

Probably similar to above, it was only backtested for 2014-2016. It needs re-optimization or debugging the reason. I'll try to run the backtest for 2017 and see what's going on. The [backtest result](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11114944#post11114944) was showing around 1 trade per day on average, so maybe you need to wait a bit longer, I'm not sure.

This EA is really nicely written. You have put a lot of effort into it. The code is very easy to understand and is nicely structured.  
  
What it lacks, is some "brains" that would allow the EA to dynamically adjust based on market conditions. Please don't get me wrong. It's a really nice EA, and the foundation for making something amazing out of it is already there.  
  
Thanks for sharing the code with us mortals. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I've published [Docker container](https://github.com/EA31337/FX-MT-VM/blob/master/Dockerfile) for backtesting and supported containers can be pulled from [Docker's hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ea31337/fx-mt-vm/). The main container (latest) doesn't have any backtest data by default, so it needs to download each time, but in the next days/weeks I can provide tagged containers per each pair and year, so they'll come with data ready for testing, so all files needs to be downloaded only once (so once you've got container downloaded, backtest or optimization test can be started in few seconds with a single command). Here is the [list of supported historical data](https://github.com/FX-Data) (I'm still populating the data, DS means _Dukascopy_ feed). These repositories consist of raw CSV files which are converted to MT4 HST/FXT format by the scripts for all the timeframes (including custom ones). On request, any source/broker data can be added, including cryptocurrencies, so the new data can be used for backtesting/optimization.  
  
Once [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) is installed (on Windows, Linux or macOS), you can pull the container by (run in the terminal/cmd):  
docker pull ea31337/fx-mt-vm  
  
Then for help run: docker run ea31337/fx-mt-vm help  
For backtesting param, run: docker run ea31337/fx-mt-vm run_backtest  
  
To run the backtest, you can use supported params as displayed by above help command.  
  
Here is the example command for backtesting v1.075 for 2017.01-02 on EURUSD with spread 10:  
docker run -e BOOT_CODE='file_get [https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/r...ull-v1.075.ex4](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/download/v1.075/EA31337-Lite-Full-v1.075.ex4)' ea31337/fx-mt-vm run_backtest -e EA31337 -y 2017 -m 1-2 -p EURUSD -s 10 -v  
  
To test the different version, change it in two places in above command.  
  
There are many custom params, so backtest or optimization tests can be fully customized. In the next weeks, I'll be improving and simplifying backtesting processes for Docker, so any version of EA can be re-optimized. So if you need any particular feature, please let me know.

I was thinking exactly the same way. I was attempting to add RSI_DynamicPeriod param (some logic in RSI_CheckPeriod()), but I don't know any equation which allows detecting the current best period (without trials and errors), and the optimization process only finds the average one, so it's something to work on (it's the limitation of all EAs based on technical indicators). The larger optimization period, the values are actually more flatten, so it's safer to use, but less flexible and profitable at the same time.  
  
I'll be working on the refactor soon, I hope, so I was planning to add dummy trades, which aims to be the simulation of the real trades, but only happening in the EA's memory, so based on the dummy/hidden profit happening in the memory (like opening dummy trades for different periods and comparing the profits), EA can find the best params (such as current best periods and other params), for the current dataset, in order to use it before actually starting to trade, then opening only certain type of trades after they were tested and proven in the memory.  
  
Another method is to tap the params into machine learning algorithm and calculate the best params along as the EA trades.

Is it possible to make a Docker container including EURUSD data 2007-current?  
  
I don't think it makes sense to use earlier data but some people go back to 2003.  
  
Maybe there is a file size limitation of the containers.

This was the first thought I had while reading your code. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Not only could it optimize the parameters but also enable/disable indicators and strategies based on performance during different market conditions.

You can use -y option for any year which is listed in [FX-Data-EURUSD-DS repo](https://github.com/FX-Data/FX-Data-EURUSD-DS) (check the _Branch_ select list, or [tag release files](https://github.com/FX-Data/FX-Data-EURUSD-DS/releases)), and it'll be downloaded automatically from this repo. There is data available between 2007 and 2017. Usually I upload the current year once it's finished, but I can also upload 2018 partially before that. There are also few combinations of multiple years such as 2011-2015, 2015-2017. I'll publish containers including the data inside soon, so downloading the container will have everything included. Using -m is optional, you can use -m1-2 for the first 2 months, and when you don't specify -m, the whole year is tested.  
  
The actual result files can be generated and published on your host machine, or uploaded anywhere. I'm working on it to test and improve this process as well.  
  
Using containers, you can run backtests/optimization tests non-interactively and in parallel on the cloud (any cloud that can support Docker containers, and most of them do). So it's very powerful tool. Something like MT5 got the optimization on the cloud, but this method gives you more flexibility. Potentially it can support MT5 backtesting as well.

To answer your question from the different point. To test the full period since 2007, it requires a lot of memory, processing and time. Initially, I was using Vagrant (similar to Docker) to automate the tests. Testing 2 years in a row was challenging as it was very slow and memory hungry given the number of ticks (~150mln ticks), then I've advanced to 3 years (~350mln ticks), which also takes very long time and MT4 is using a lot of memory. I've already created dataset for 2011-2015 (4 years), but I think there was a problem running it, but I'll need to check again. The first limitation probably is with the platform, as far as I remember, the FXT files cannot be bigger than few GB (2 or 4). If you pass that limitation, it still can go out-of-memory, so most likely MT4 platform won't run the test. So for easier testing and to avoid headaches, I prefer to backtest each year separately, also to not rely on the success and higher balance from the previous periods, and to test the different start. But I can also provide backtesting for the 4-10 years in a row, if that will work.

How do you start an optimization?  
  
Maybe this is not available yet?  
  
I guess one should enable only part of the profitable strategies first and then optimize each one like you already explained.

MQL5 Ltd does have some biased opinion when reports come to them.  
  
I also have seller's account at MQL5; FYI.  
  
I am here now because my EA, though passed preliminary check, it kept failing when moderator tested it.  
  
It never fails to run what-so-ever using the terminal which i used in many different brokers and does work flawlessly.  
  
I finally gave up and now doing some research to improve my strategy for the sake of long term running, which leads me to this thread.

It's supported, all the optimization was done using the scripts. You need to pass -o param to run_backtest script to activate the optimization mode. Here is the example syntax:  
run_backtest.sh -x -o -t -v -I TestModel=0 -S ValidateSettings=0,WriteReport=0 -E maxdrawdown_enable=1,maxdrawdown=50 -f $SET_PATH/EA31337.set -e EA31337 -c USD -p EURUSD -d 10000 -s 10 -y 2017 -m 1-12 -D 5 -P M30 -b DS -M 4.0.0.1010 -i $RULES_PATH/Common/.init.rules.inc -i $RULES_PATH/$RULEFILE.rule -r ReportName -O /opt/results  
  
Most of the params are optional, or you can adjust to your needs. Most important is to pass set file with -f. Either you can prepare SET file ready for optimization, or you can use [rules files](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-optimization-rules) which will parse the SET and prepare the file according to which param you want to optimize for MT4 optimization process (e.g. to optimize MA profit-take load the Strategy-MA-All-MA_TrailingProfitMethod.rule file). Then the results are generated in the specified output dir. With Docker, you can mount your external dir by -v (e.g. -v /LOCAL/PATH:/opt/results:rw) so your results are generated on your local folder. I haven't tested it with Docker yet, but it should just work, and I'll be improving the process further to simplify it.

When you'll use the provided rule files, they're automatically designed to disable all the other strategies (by modifying the SET file) and optimize only one specific strategy at a time with the fixed lot size and other strict rules, to only focus on the specific param.

They're very bad at doing good. I had also problems when accepting each version of EA, so important fixes took few weeks to accept. They've added preliminary check which was always finding some errors and issues which were not reproducible, so I had to put some blind fixes with trial and error to satisfy their checks.  
  
After I've reported scam brokers in their official app (which are still there), and CDN servers using the incognito account (as I knew this is going to end bad), then they kept removing my few forum posts (here is the [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20180309124001/https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/231295)), like they wanted to hide it from the public. In short, I wanted to report that they've dozens of MT4 broker's platforms on their CDN server (these servers are officially listed in their app) which are pointing to the same fake/scam servers (where people believe it's a live server, but in fact, it's the demo), so scammers get their money directly to their bank, your money never touches your real account and they make you believe you've lost your money (which are the numbers of the screen). After I've reported this problem in details at their Service Desk, they've tracked my seller account via IP address and removed both accounts, they didn't want to give back my $2000USD balance which I had deposited, so I had to scare them with the court, so they gave me back part of it. They've also removed all my effort which I put on reporting 20+ bugs against their MT4/MT5 platform, and removed unfinished jobs, so I couldn't pay the developer. So basically no comment. I don't think MQL5 Ltd will stay on the market for the long time given how they operate and what decision they make.  
  
I've described this [scam method in details in the following post](https://money.stackexchange.com/a/91761/6888). This is the scam on the global scale finding their victims worldwide. Basically, MT4 is the only platform which is scam friendly.

Hi all,  
  
I was doing backtest for V1.075 few days ago but encounter some problem.  
1\. Why the maximal drawdown value is different in the backtest report and journal details?  
The backtest report show maximal drawndown is $111.62 But the journal is written as $32.5 ? Which 1 is correct?

Awesome results you've got, especially for such a high spread.  
  
The signal level range depends on the technical indicator which strategy is using, so there are no fixed ranges, and it'll be difficult to standarize all of them into fixed range. It's basically the shift from the value which is produced by the given technical indicator. The easiest would be to check the code logic in corresponding Trade_... function.  
  
It's not clear which strategy you're talking, but let's give as the example the RSI, and the following logic:  
case ORDER_TYPE_BUY: result = rsi[period][CURR] < (50 - signal_level);  
case ORDER_TYPE_SELL: result = rsi[period][CURR] > (50 + signal_level);  
So the reasonable signal level is starting from 20 (so you will get 30 for buy, and 70 value for sell), then increasing it to 40 makes 10 vs. 90, which is already extreme, so making it 50 and beyond, you won't get any trades, as RSI technical indicator operates between 0 and 100. And setting it too low, like between 1-20 most likely will produce too many trades. That kind of range is similar to CCI and WPR.  
  
For other strategies where base indicators are like MA or Alligator, where the indicator values corresponding to the pair prices, the signal level is basically the distance in pips. So 0 means the original exact signal condition, 0.5 means half a pip, 1.0 means a pip away from the original value. Negative values mean the opposite (like triggering the signals right before the MA cross happens).  
  
So basically, for MA strategy/indicator, it's the distance between MA Fast and Medium on cross condition, so positive values will trigger signal after the cross happened, and negative values mean the opposite, will trigger the signal right before the MA cross happens.  
  
For Alligator, it's similar, so it's the distance between Lips/Teeth lines, and Teeth/Jaw lines. For MACD, it's the the distance between main and signal line in pips (signal level set to zero, means no extra distance, therefore the original, usual condition). E.g.  
double gap = signal_level * pip_size;  
case ORDER_TYPE_BUY: result = macd[period][CURR][MODE_MAIN] > macd[period][CURR][MODE_SIGNAL] + gap; // MACD rises above the signal line.  
case ORDER_TYPE_SELL: result = macd[period][CURR][MODE_MAIN] < macd[period][CURR][MODE_SIGNAL] - gap; // MACD falls below the signal line.  
  
For some strategies like Bands, Envelopes, the signal level is not implemented yet. And for some, like Fractals, the param is not compatible, due to lack of dynamic values, so some other similar value needs to be used.  
  
So in general, some signal levels should be increased with smaller steps like (0.1-0.2), some with integers (1-2), so while optimizing, you should know by trial and error how much it changes the results.

One of these drawdowns isn't correct, so it's most likely the bug of the calculation function (as it's calculated independently from MT4) or due to some other factors. The logic is in [CalculateSummary()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/ce7f55146a29d6015ac3fce319162cd64e387ab1/SummaryReport.mqh#L171) (SummaryReport class).

The EA looks very promising - many thanks to the author for sharing it and also for sharing the source code!  
  
Despite following the instructions for downloading and placing the sources into the right MT4 directories I am struggling to compile the EA in the MQ4 editor (version 5.0, build 1601) and would be thankful for any advice. Here are the errors I am getting:

You need at least MetaEditor build 1745, as 1601 is too buggy for the code. For further details, check posts [#31](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10983629#post10983629), [#68](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10989743#post10989743) and beyond. If you still got the issues, try compiling the tag release branch ([v1.075](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/tree/v1.075)) as the master branch could be not stable right now.

Is there EX5 files? I only see EX4 on your releases page  
I'm trying to run it on MT5 and not sure how.

Many thanks for the quick and helpful response! I followed your advice and all errors but the copy struct disappeared:  
  
'=' - structure have objects and cannot be copied Trade.mqh 60 18  
  
To solve this last issue, I changed the code in Trade.mqh to copy the structure parameters one by one. Here is my solution it just in case somebody has got the same issue:  
  
void Trade(TradeParams &_params) {  
// trade_params = _params; -> this didn't work on my MQ4 version, so copying the parameters one by one  
trade_params.account = _params.account;  
trade_params.chart = _params.chart;  
trade_params.slippage = _params.slippage;  
  
trade_params.account = (CheckPointer(trade_params.account) == POINTER_INVALID ? new Account : trade_params.account);  
trade_params.chart = (CheckPointer(trade_params.chart) == POINTER_INVALID ? new Chart : trade_params.chart);  
}  
  
Now the EA successfully compiles.

Version for MT5 requires further work, so it's not available yet. Most of the [classes](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes) should compile and work in MT5 as well, but the trading functions need to be fixed/refactored. The aim is to create the EA which will work on both MT4 and MT5.

Lately I was doing some research on the subject as a prep for converting my own EAs to MT5. The most challenging part is the trade management.  
  
Luckily for late comers like me, others have done some of the work already and there is a library out there to help with the conversion: <https://www.ea-coder.com/convert-mql4-to-mql5/>

I believe you're still missing the MetaEditor build 1745 requirement, as the code should compile without any changes, so please double check which build you're using.

EA got its own libraries/classes/methods implemented which work for both MT4 and MT5 at the same time (using preprocessor conditional compilation directives), so no need for extra conversions or external libraries. Support for MT5 code is already in the advanced stage, so in this case, the general articles won't help much. These are only for some simple conversion.  
  
The current challenge is to implement asynchronous trades (MT5) along with the synchronous trades (MT4). Most of the forum posts say it's not possible, but EA aims at implementing something despite what other people claim, but it takes time.

Not that I've tried but I see no reason for why this would not work. All is implemented in MT5 for TradeAsync. For HFT this is a must.

Thanks kenorb .  
  
I actually come across the name 'EA31337' by accident when searching for EA builder long while ago. I remembered it because, it did appears that many discussion about this EA has been extremely positive. I was trying to understand how the EA works but there was little details, however, there are plenty websites out there trying to sell EA with this name. Then I start prowling the FF forum.....there you are..  
  
Never bought anything but certainly 31337 left a good mark. There were other ones, again only numbers. Thank you again for sharing this out and explanation. I'll test the EA and report back. I think backtesting EA only gives as much, but forward testing is the real confidence building session.

Thanks for EA. Probably stupid suggestion, but I tried it manually and it had some sense...Just I do not like to sit and watch my monitor all day long. I think it could be 10 min job for a good coder... Take v. 1072 EA and code it to open trades only in direction of 30 min TF half-trend indicator or any other reliable trend indi. Close trades when indi changes direction. Add only this one thing and leave all others as they are. Something like that.

You don't need coding, EA got parameterized condition-action system, so you can setup action to close trades on the direction change. But I don't think many people tried that. Many people suggest something without realizing it's already there.  
So basically using actions, you can setup closure of the trades (such as all, only the one with the trend, or against the trend, or losing once, or profitable, or whatever group you choose), on the indicator change value such as Moving Average Fast is going opposite direction to Slow one, or any other market event condition (on a buy or sell signal of any supported indicator such as RSI, or 28+ of other).  
Please test and let me know if this is what you're looking for.

Thanks for reply. Closure of the trades is only a part of the question. Probably this is my fault, because I could not find how to change the main trend detection setting. It should be more sensitive. Under the main trend I mean the one that is shown on the chart. I have noticed that it continues to show previous trend direction and EA opens new countertrend orders even hours after the trend has changed. And this causes terrible losses. That is why I came with simple solution to use half-trend M30 as trend indi. It reacts almost perfect to trend change.  
I have read about the EA settings, but could not find an answer about how to change the main trend settings. And again, sorry, probably this is my fault.

For changing trend detection sensitivity, you need to optimize _TrendMethod_ param for v1.072, or _TrendPeriod_ in v1.075 (based on RSI). Related posts [#178](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11051153#post11051153)-[#180](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11051636#post11051636), [#189](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11053558#post11053558), [#197](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11060850#post11060850) (2nd part).  
In v1.072, when optimizing _TrendMethod_ param, you're basically changing the sensitivity on the timeframe basis, so you're basically telling EA which timeframe should get the higher priority to tell about the main trend (check GetTrend() in Trend class for logic).  
In v1.075, the trend is based on the RSI and uses params such as: _TrendPeriod (the main param)_ , _RSI_Period_ and _RSI_Applied_Price_ (uses some values from RSI strategy) to calculate the trend strength between -0.5 and 0.5 where range between -0.1 and 0.1 is considered the neutral trend (no trades), and value below or above 0.3 is considered as the strong trend, so you're in full control how sensitive is the trend detection.

Ok Guys I will start will a real Account with 200$ in the [XM](/brokers/xm "View XM Broker Profile") Broker in July. I'm doing this for a gain for 5% - 10% monthly. I read all the thread and I will go with the last version. I will give a feedback weekly to see how to tune and see how is working with a Real Account! For last thanks for this EA.

Thanks @Kenorb for the Ea, i had a few questions that you might be able help on.  
  
I understand that the EA learns the longer it has been active on the pair , so presumably if i wanted to switch it on or off when i perceived the market to be in the most optimum place (ie trending), presumably stopping and starting would only mess up all the settings?  
  
what about if i reached a point like 20% increase in equity halfway through the month and i wanted to stop trading , could i use the account condition "suspend all strategies" , and would it then mess up the settings (what the EA has learned) when i revert to "UNsuspend all stategies " (presumably all other params are set to "none" )  
  
Have you ever tested this on either Range or Renko bars?   
  
I have tried V1.072 with great results over the last few days ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f642.png?v=15.1)in a trending market closing basket manually,interested to see its performance in consolidation. (also tried V.1073 but it didnt make any trades in 3 days.

The version v1.072 was optimized very long time ago, and market conditions changes every year, and further versions I've confirmed them broken.  
  
However, finally I've manage to release the new version v1.076 which you can find at <https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases>  
  
Also attached here:

.  
  
I didn't have time to test it on demo, my main focus was to produce good optimization results for 2018, so I've no idea how it performs on demo accounts. What I know, it generates a lot of trades, so **please use it with caution**.  
  
Note: **Use this version only against EURUSD pair with accounts with spread lower than 10** , as this is what it was optimized for. If you've account with higher [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), try on the demo first, but it's better to wait for further releases which can improve support for higher spreads, otherwise you can try to disable some lower-timeframe strategies. It was also tested with deposit of 10k USD, if you've lower deposit, please also test it on demo first for couple of weeks if it can adjust to your market conditions and current account balance.  
  
Suggested run:  
\- Timeframe M30 or M15, but it really shouldn't make any difference.  
\- EURUSD with spread 10 or lower.  
\- Default settings.  
  
Here are the results for EURUSD 2018 with spread 10:

Note: The reason why it's not curved to the end is, because it was only optimized for the first 6 months due to huge amount of computation involved while optimizing parameters, so dealing with the unknown data on the 2nd half of the year which was never optimized for is actually pretty well in my opinion.  
  
I've created EA Tester scripts which you can easily backtest EA with a single command.  
  
After installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (should work for Windows, macOS and Linux), you can run the following command in your operating system command-line terminal:  
  

Inserted Code
    
    
    docker run ea31337/ea-tester:EURUSD-2018-DS run_backtest -v -e https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/download/v1.076/EA31337-Lite-v1.076.ex4

  
Here is the recorded terminal demo how the backtesting using Docker is performed: <https://asciinema.org/a/233268> (press play button after clicking).  
  
I haven't tested it for 2019, so please let me know. For any bugs you find, please report them at [GitHub](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/issues). We've also group at Telegram IM at <https://t.me/EA31337> if you need any quicker response, as I'm not very active on this forum. I'm usually replying the private messages here after couple of months later as the interface is not very intuitive, sorry![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Also, to let you know, I don't look for any work or projects to work on (other indicators or EAs), as I've received couple of messages like that.  
  
If you'd like to compile the project or read more about it, please check the following [wiki pages](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki).  
  
I'm planning to release further improved versions soon which can definitely beat the above results.

I think it's a MT4 platform bug, as it works when backtesting, the problem is when attaching to the chart. Somebody should report it as a bug to MT4 support (they've removed my accounts for no reason, so I can't). It was compiled using MetaEditor 5.0.0.1966.  
  
Anyway, I've recompiled it again, and this version should work: [https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/r...ite-v1.076.ex4](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/download/v1.076/EA31337-Lite-v1.076.ex4)

So I am running the latest version on vps on EURUSD 30min chart. EA performed really good last week due to that crazy moves EU made.

Just to clarify this EA was attached to this week and started trading on Monday March 18th, since then it have made more than 2k trading 0.01 lots.

Although it generated 30% in a week and half (including today's 12%), please note that the trades were closed manually. It seems v1.076 has trouble closing the trades on time, and it's going to be improved the next version. So if you're on green, consider closing the trades. Also few other issues has been identified.

This test was testing other pairs, the EA works currently only on EURUSD, which it didn't really lose much. It also depends on the week, it needs at least a month of testing.  
  
This month is great. The Singh1's run is on 33th position of top monthly trades.

And refaey's hit 60% of profit in just 2 weeks on the demo account.

Thanks. Is there a setfile or additional indicators that one would require. I ran a quick backtest of this year (2019) and it goes south pretty consistently, which is different from the other tests here, so I am curious.

Make sure the spread is 10 or below, the test is done for every tick, for at least few months, it also depends on the broker data, so the broker backtest could be not reliable if the data doesn't have enough ticks (there need to be at least few ticks per each minute). Otherwise, I don't know, there could be some other variables come into play (leverage, high spread/commissions, starting deposit, lack of tick data, etc).

Okay, so the setfile is actually just the default settings then?   
  
Also I notice in the journal that some indicators are missing. For example, something like:

That means M30 timeframe historical data could be not available at the time of the run. As far as I know, MT4 platform got the bug, that if you run on M1, it may not load M30 correctly. Similarly, when you run on H1, it may not load M1 data, it could also mean missing the appropriate HST files. Because of that, EA got conditions to check for the valid available data, before running the strategies. So the optimal way is to run on M15 or M30, then all timeframes between M1 and M30 data should be available. If still won't work, there is something missing in your configuration.

You can download it from: <https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/tag/v1.077>  
Before running, please read the important notes on that link. Make sure your account is compatible with this EA (e.g. spread).  
I'm also attaching the file here. Use Lite, as it has been already tested, eventually Rider, it's up to you. Advanced version is not optimized yet. Test it on the demo first.  
  
This week just started, and both EA instances hit the top 10.

New version has been released. It works both in MetaTrader 4 and 5.  
  
This version has been optimized to EURUSD based on 2019 year. For other pairs, use it with caution (backtest before use). You are free to optimize the parameter values to more suitable for your data.  
Please find below the backtest results for the EA31337 trading robot using MetaTrader 4.

It's with minimal lot size for good risk management and safety where DD is less than 5% (Lite/Advanced), but you can increase the lot size accordingly if you need higher risk and %. Or starting with a smaller deposit (e.g. 1000), the % can be much higher.  
Also the setup could be not optimal yet, it can be further optimized for your broker data.

I always stand for a good job and you do it well. keep it up !! . I will be watching this thread. I personally do not use any indicators. I try to manage only profit and loss. I did it, checked hundreds of indicators - in my opinion, opening positions can be completely random - it is important to then maximize profits and cut losses accordingly. you always have a 50% chance of opening a position in the right direction. it is enough that your profit will be 1 pip more than your loss, you are ahead with tens of thousands of trades. no analysis makes sense, it's just a waste of time

Hello ;  
  
First of all, I would like to thank you for the robot you shared. I have been a writer for 20 years, I have not seen anyone write in this way. Again, thank you.I have a few questions I want to ask. Helps if you do I would appreciate it. taking the macd, cci and moving average indicator, I would like to mention a few of my questions.  
  
Strategy actives and strategy stops. As an example here, let's assume that we have selected macd in a 5-minute strategy.  
In strategy stops, let's take the Moving Average in the 1-hour part.  
  
1 - Exactly what strategy actives and strategy stops do.  
2 - In the selected strategies, if more than one strategy is selected, does it need to receive signals from all of them at the same time, or does it process signals from each of them separately?  
3 - How can I manually set the stoploss and takeprofit? When I put a fixed takeprofit on the robot (example 20 pips), it does not close orders when it becomes profitable by 20 pips, sometimes it takes a very short profit and sometimes it comes out  
the wide stop opens and closes at a loss.  
  
4 - include/common/mode.h activated file as follows. Because I wanted to see and change the input parameters in some indicators. Only when I activate the __config__ parameter, the robot does not compile,the compiler is giving an error. i want to take the parameters from the config file I defined manually and run the robot, but when I activate the __config__ parameter, the program is not compiled.  
  
#define __advanced__ // Enables advanced configuration.  
//#define __config__ // Loads params from the config files. ???  
#define __input__ // Enables user input parameters.  
#define __release__ // Enables release settings.  
  
5 - When I compile the robot in advanced and input mode, I can see all the input parameters of all indicators. While there are levels in indicators such as CCI, OSMA, MACD, there is no level parameter in the moving average indicator, but inside the robot  
all indicators have common parameters, the same as in the macd indicator. how to use the signal open level, signal close level parameter in the moving average indicator. According to what it is calculated ?  
  
  
INPUT float MACD_LotSize =0;  
INPUT int MACD_SignalOpenMethod = 0; // Signal open method (-127-127) ?  
INPUT float MACD_SignalOpenLevel = 2.0f; // Signal open level ?  
INPUT int MACD_SignalOpenFilterMethod = 32; // Signal open filter method ?  
INPUT int MACD_SignalOpenFilterTime = 3; // Signal open filter time ?  
INPUT int MACD_SignalOpenBoostMethod = 0; // Signal open boost method ?  
INPUT int MACD_SignalCloseMethod = 0; // Signal close method (-127-127) ?  
INPUT int MACD_SignalCloseFilter = 0; // Signal close filter (-127-127) ?  
INPUT float MACD_SignalCloseLevel = 2.0f; // Signal close level ?  
INPUT int MACD_PriceStopMethod = 1; // Price stop method (0-127) ?  
INPUT float MACD_PriceStopLevel = 2; // Price stop level ?  
INPUT int MACD_TickFilterMethod = 32; // Tick filter method ?  
INPUT float MACD_MaxSpread = 4.0; // Max spread to trade (pips)  
INPUT short MACD_Shift = 0; // Shift  
INPUT float MACD_OrderCloseLoss =80; // Order close loss  
INPUT float MACD_OrderCloseProfit =80; // Order close profit  
INPUT int MACD_OrderCloseTime = -30; // Order close time in mins (>0) or bars (<0)  
  
INPUT int MACD_Indi_MACD_Period_Fast =6; // Period Fast  
INPUT int MACD_Indi_MACD_Period_Slow=34; // Period Slow  
INPUT int MACD_Indi_MACD_Period_Signal = 10; // Period Signal  
INPUT ENUM_APPLIED_PRICE MACD_Indi_MACD_Applied_Price = PRICE_OPEN; // Applied Price  
INPUT int MACD_Indi_MACD_Shift = 0; // Shift  
  
Can you explain the question marks at the end of the parameters mentioned above with a short sentence? Can you explain by giving an example? For example, the MACD_SignalOpenBoostMethod parameter is 0. What does that mean? what if I give 1 or 2 or 100 ?  
MACD_SignalOpenLevel and MACD_SignalCloseMethod what works what values do I need to give.  
  
6 - On some indicators I see the following parameters. What are these parameters, what are they useful for ? Can you explain ?  
  
-Platform Built-in  
-Chart Calculation  
-iCustom : Custom indicator file  
-iCustom : Custom, legacy, provided by MT indicator file  
-OnIndicator : Another indicator as source of data  
-OnCalculate : Custom calculation function  
-MAth-based indicator  
  
  
Thank you.

>  taking the macd, cci and moving average indicator, I would like to mention a few of my questions. Strategy actives and strategy stops. As an example here, let's assume that we have selected macd in a 5-minute strategy. In strategy stops, let's take the Moving Average in the 1-hour part.  
>  **1 - Exactly what strategy actives and strategy stops do**.

Active strategy are responsible for market analysis and mainly for opening the trades. For closing as well, however when you set different stop strategy, you override defaults strategy with another to manage its stops (TP/SL).  
  
Let's say, you've active strategy as RSI, and stop strategy set to Bands.  
Strategy RSI relies on RSI indicator values (based on assigned timeframe), based on the signal open logic, it'll open buy at <20 value, and sell at >80 value. After open, strategy monitors its own opened trades/orders for closing signals.  
There are two ways order can be closed.  
First way is by opposite signal (buy signal will trigger closure of existing sell trades, and other way round), in case of RSI, when you hit <20 indicator value, you close active sells and so on. This type of closure is monitoring by strategy code in the background when to close.  
Second method for closing order is by stops, this is by settings TP/SL values and it's outside of strategy control when the stops are triggered. In case of RSI, based on the current implementation, strategy scans for last (let's say 12) candles where indicator values were at peak, then set trailing stops at these peak prices. In case of other indicators which produces prices as output (not range values such as 0-100), the stops are set by its peak indicator values.  
  
So when you set Bands strategy to manage stops, then the order is opened by signals based on RSI values, logic for closing order on opposite signal is also RSI, you're just override updating of TP/SL values. So every candle, the trailing stops are managed by Bands strategy which are stops based on Bollinger Bands indicator values.  
For example your order is opened for buy at RSI <20, then can be closed when price upper value of Bands indicator. Basically combination of two indicators.  
  
So in your example, MACD strategy will open order when signal crosses main line in lower part of histogram in M5 timeframe, and setting MA on H1 strategy for stops, will close at peak of MA value in H1 timeframe.

>

The idea of strategies are that they can be run independently as much as possible, so the results can be reliable and repeatable. With trading, tiny influence can change the whole result. That was the issue with v1 releases, strategies were relying too much on some shared options, and on slight change, you had to re-optimize all strategies from scratch. With v2 releases, each strategy has its own isolated parameters and logic, then assigned to specific timeframes.  
And the main EA (acts as strategy manager) [checks for each strategy](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/EA.mqh#L410-L437) for its signal (see: [SignalOpen()](https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-RSI/blob/v1.012/Stg_RSI.mqh#L90-L113), each strategy implements its own signal) which are mainly based on indicator values attached to the given strategy.  
It's possible that multiple strategies can trigger signal (2 buys, 1 sell) after certain filters, these are processed by [signal manager](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/EA.mqh#L258-L343) (see: [TradeSignalManager.h](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/Trade/TradeSignalManager.h)) which decides whether to open trades or not. For example strategy could raise signals, but EA will reject it, because of some filters set by users (outside of peak hours, too many orders from the same strategy, one signal per candle filter, daily limit, margin used >1%, strategy's order needs to be better positioned than last time, and so on). So strategy manager has the final call whether to translate signal into actual trade. Using conditions, you can also suspend strategy from trading for certain amount of time. Each signal is like a object/struct, you can manage it, but they can be quickly expired when the price moves out of the target range. In v3 releases, signal manager receiving multiple signals at the same time would be able to prioritize based on some criteria (e.g. out of 5 signals in the same candle, pick the one from the strategy which has the highest profit factor or wins). This was part of v1 releases, but it was too complex to optimize reliably, as one small global change was breaking all other strategies, so v2 introduces more isolation between strategies (once you optimize strategy on its own, there is aim of minimal influence from the EA to change the trading logic), and v3 will add even more complex filters and rules.

>

Each strategy has its own TP/SL logic implemented based on the indicator values, making it fixed, it's missing the point of isolation of different strategies, because you apply something shared across all of it. You've to write custom strategy or pick the one which implements such fixed stops (there are few I think, but I think I can write more which can do some fixed stops). To override stops for strategy, you've to override [PriceStop()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/Strategy.mqh#L1004).  
There is still a way to set maximum SL/TP in pips, check 'Close loss/profit (in pips)' params in EA Advanced (as Lite is designed to run strategies as they are in pure/isolated form, and aim of Rider is to have closure based on equity conditions, not fixed values). This won't change the logic of strategy's dynamic stops, it's just overriding the maximum stop loss that order can take in pips.

The __config__ option was implemented, so each instance of strategy loads with different set of parameters (like loading settings from the config file). This is the result of limitation of MetaTrader platform where you can have limited type and amount of parameters. Using select list (based on enums) and textfields for input params for EA is really too limited. The goal was to set different param values for strategy per each timeframe.  
Basically each strategy (such as [RSI](https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-RSI/blob/v1.012/Stg_RSI.mqh#L8-L28)) comes with around 20 input parameters, with 50 strategies you've 1000 input parameters. So different settings per timeframe (~20) is around 20000 parameters for EA, which is not possible to expose to the user (btw. there is hardcoded +1100 max params or something forced by platform). So __config__ was storing different strategy's param per timeframe in [config/*.h](https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-RSI/tree/v1.012/config) files. Then I had automated optimization tests triggered by _GitHub Actions_ which were looking for the best param values for the given timeframe and adding these values into these config files (e.g. M15.h). The thing is, once params are loaded from these config file (.h), main user's params needs to be overridden. So if you set __config__, param values from config files are overriding these set in user's inputs.  
This was an idea, but too complex to manage with 50 strategies, 10 timeframes, potentially 10 different pairs each, plus to run extensive tests, I'll have to pay for the self-runners (hard to setup due to platform limitations and issues), as these tests were too heavy for GitHub public workers to handle (secondly, they're not allowing it). At the end, I've found that is no much benefit of changing different values per timeframe per strategy. What I did, that you can still override them in EA Advanced, but still for all of them. In addition, I've hit some MQL code syntax limitations (it's not C++ at the end). So I'll have to reintroduce these individual set of params per strategy and timeframe at different way. In summary, I'm going to drop the support for this __config__ feature, so compilation errors may happen, as the code become outdated.

Each market is completely different. You can't have one strategy which works for all. Unless you've very risky strategy (like martingale).  
I've [Pattern strategy](https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-Pattern/tree/v1.012) which can analyze over [50 different candle patterns](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/Pattern.enum.h), and still different patterns can work differently for different pairs.  
The same when I've tried machine learning, it learnt EURUSD, and same learning didn't apply for other pairs.

These are sources of input data for analysis (data feeders). Not all strategies are implementing each, it depends on the indicator and platform.  
  
\- Platform Built-in  
  
This mode uses built-in mode such as documented at <https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/indicators> (e.g. iMA, iRSI).  
The values are provided by the platform and you don't have much control over the data that is provided.  
You're limited to only these which are implemented by the platform, plus different indicators are available for MT4 vs MT5, and there are different implementations between different platforms (e.g. iEnvelopes in MQL4 got 3 modes, in MQL5 there are 2), so when you're writing universal code which works for both, you've to write a lot of hacks (to provide backward compatibility).  
  
\- Chart Calculation  
  
This takes custom chart data as input. Normally you rely on OHLC from platform's chart, using this mode, you can override chart data with different one.  
Good example is [Heiken Ashi indicator](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/Indicators/Indi_HeikenAshi.mqh) which "produces" chart (it outputs OHLC). So you can run indicator on top of Heiken Ashi indicator as it would be a chart.  
Or implement your own chart, such as Renki (which is not supported by platform by default without extensive workarounds and hacks).  
  
\- iCustom : Custom indicator file  
  
The data is fed by iCustom() pointing to external indicator. Let's say I've custom implementation of iRSI which I want to use as indicator data provider, and I don't want to use Built-in (due to some limitations or bugs).  
  
\- iCustom : Custom, legacy, provided by MT indicator file  
  
In this mode, data is fed by iCustom() pointing to the indicators provided by the platform (in MT5 you can find them in Indicators/Examples). These implementations can depends on the platform versions, sometimes they patch or change something, sometimes implementation of source code is different to the one provided by builtin indicators. By switching between this and built-in mode, you can compare the differences between these implementations.  
  
\- OnIndicator : Another indicator as source of data  
  
This is something unique I guess, I didn't see this idea anywhere implemented.  
The closest way to achieve by coding, was in MQL4 (e.g. iBandsOnArray, iRSIOnArray), but dropped in MQL5.  
So it's all custom built.  
Basically you take data of one indicator, and feed into another one to calculate it.  
For example, you can calculate RSI given MA values.  
Using EA framework, this can take ideas on another level, by chaining multiple indicators, e.g. MA->RSI->Bands.  
Why? This opens possibilities to write even more sophisticated indicators and strategies which were not possible before.  
Let's say you've RSI values and normally you've to write fixed conditions such as buy at <20 (this is what most of simple strategies does).  
When you add another indicator on top of RSI, you can actually detect its pace, speed or gradual turn in opposite direction to do some trading conditions around it.  
  
\- OnCalculate : Custom calculation function  
  
Value of indicator is calculated internally by the function, check example at [MA::Calculate()](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337-classes/blob/v2.012.2/Indicators/Indi_MA.mqh#L577-L606).  
This is alternative if you don't want to use iCustom() (platform builtin calls are slow, especially for indicators).  
Or you're not using platform where there is no builtin or iCustom(), such as C++/wasm implementation (available soon).  
  
\- Math-based indicator  
  
It's pure calculation of indicator values from the function. It's similar to OnCalculate(), but using different approach, this idea still not fully implemented.  
It's more useful for running/testing strategies outside of platform.

EA is free and open source, you don't have to use it. If you have better EA/algo (auto trading), let's try, EURUSD 2016-2023, spread 10pts, fixed lot size 0.01, anything in the world that you can find, let's compare the results, ready for the challenge?

## Which version to use?  
  
Lite, Advanced and Rider have slightly different logic (despite sharing the same codebase).  
\- Lite configuration is easy to use with simple strategy configuration per timeframe, but less customizable.  
\- Advanced has more options to offer (more complex filters), ideally for advanced users.  
\- Rider is the riskiest of all as it tries to keep the orders open for longer by "riding" on the equity (which means it closes trades when EA's equity reaches certain %). Better deals with higher [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide").  
  
Which version to use, it's to you. Check [Input parameters](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Input-parameters) wiki page for more details.  
For MetaTrader 4, please download file with `.ex4` extension, for MetaTrader 5 use `.ex5` accordingly.  
  
**Note: For .ex4 (MT4), you've to[download from GitHub](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/releases/tag/v2.012.1), as the files are too big to upload it here (limit of 5MB).**

> 5 - When I compile the robot in advanced and input mode, I can see all the input parameters of all indicators. While there are levels in indicators such as CCI, OSMA, MACD, there is no level parameter in the moving average indicator, but inside the robot all indicators have common parameters, the same as in the macd indicator. how to use the signal open level, signal close level parameter in the moving average indicator. According to what it is calculated ? Can you explain the question marks at the end of the parameters mentioned above with a short...

SignalOpenMethod  
Signal open/close methods (SOM/SCM) are type of params to control method/logic when opening or closing order. Non-zero value is used as additional filter to activate extra conditioning. It's using bitwise operation, so during optimization, all combinations can be tested.  
To explain bitwise operations, let's start with basics: ["int" type in platform is 32-bit](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/basis/types/integer) (4 bytes), which means "int" type can store 32 different combinations (conditions in our case).  
So let's say you've base condition (in RSI, buy when <20 and sell when >80).  
Then you add multiple conditions on top of your base condition, e.g.  
if (1st-bit-of-int-is-active) _result &= TRADING_CONDITION1; // 1  
if (2nd-bit-of-int-is-active) _result &= TRADING_CONDITION2; // 2  
if (3rd-bit-of-int-is-active) _result &= TRADING_CONDITION3; // 4  
if (4th-bit-of-int-is-active) _result &= TRADING_CONDITION4; // 8  
...  
Then if you optimize SOM param between 0 and 15, you've tested all the combinations/permutations of above conditions (0+1, 0+2, 0+1+2, 0+4, 0+1+4, ...).  
This way you can write some conditions for your strategy and test out which combinations works the best.  
  
SignalOpenLevel  
Signal open/close level params (SOL/SCL) are type of param to control sensitivity of opening or closing order. The logic can vary depending if it can be used with associated indicator or not. For RSI, level 20 is calculated from the middle (50-20 vs 50+20). In MACD (in the recent version), it's percentage of change value, so you can filter out slow vs sudden movements of the indicator. For other strategies (which uses price indicators), level is additional difference between actual signal and when it's actually opened (calculated in pips) which acts like a delay or additional confirmation. Logic can vary depends on strategy. These are provided for strategy, so they can implement how it's suitable for the particular use case.  
  
SignalOpenFilterMethod/SignalCloseFilterMethod  
Same idea as above, using bitwise operations, you can test different filters. Here are the examples (this can change between versions):  
  
\- 0 - disabled  
\- 1 - avoid opening multiple trades in the same strategy's candle  
\- 2 - open trades only with the main trend  
\- 4 - open trades when price is above pivot point of the current strategy's candle  
\- 8 - do not open trades when there are opposite active trades (hedging)  
\- 16 - open trades only on candle's peak prices  
\- 32 - do not open trades when there are better one already opened in the same direction  
\- 64 - do not open trades when account's equity is lower than 1% (this option may change)  
\- -64 - do not open trades when account's equity is higher than 1% (this option may change)  
\- Note: When combining filters by a sum, AND operation applies. Negative values will negate filter.  
  
So to apply multiple filters, you just sum them together, so 24 means 8+16 filters are activated.  
Same when closing the order.  
  
OpenFilterTime  
It's using bitwise operation to filter by trading time. Same rules apply (sum activates multiple options):  
  
\- 0 - disabled  
\- 1 - Chicago's trading hours (14-23 GMT)  
\- 2 - Frankfurt's trading hours (7-16 GMT)  
\- 4 - Hong Kong's trading hours (1-10 GMT)  
\- 8 - London's trading hours (8-17 GMT)  
\- 16 - New York's trading hours (13-22 GMT)  
\- 32 - Sydney's trading hours (22-7 GMT)  
\- 64 - Tokyo's trading hours (0-9 GMT)  
\- 128 - Wellington's trading hours (22-6 GMT)  
\- Note: When combining filters by a sum, OR operation applies. Negative values will negate filter.  
  
SignalOpenBoostMethod  
Not fully implemented yet, it's going to boost lot sizes based on bitwise conditions. E.g. increase lot size by 10% if e.g. requested trade is with main trend.  
  
PriceStopMethod  
It's changing strategy's stop method by adding extra code based on bitwise operations. E.g. you can control whether your trailing stop is locked or not, or adding filter to apply additional logic. This feature is still in progress.  
  
Input parameters (including above filters) used by EA are documented in more details at this [wiki page](https://github.com/EA31337/EA31337/wiki/Input-parameters).

Hi Kenorb;  
  
When testing the Rider or Advanced robot, regardless of the timeframe, envelope only opens a buy position in its strategy. Sell is not opening the position. Can you check?  
Thanks

Ok, will check. The only issue could be in the following opening signal code at [https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-....mqh#L108-L125](https://github.com/EA31337/Strategy-Envelopes/blob/v1.012/Stg_Envelopes.mqh#L108-L125)  
I'll validate the conditions.
