**I SR METHOD**

**Welcome**  
  
My Name is Informed and I have been trading the financial markets for a few years, and through my years of trading I have notice certain things about the market that I have been blind to before.  
  
The MARKETS are not free markets determined by random price movement but markets that move influenced by those able to see both sides of the markets(market makers), these price movement can be understood and modelled to take advantage of price for a profit.  
  
The ISR Method is not created but discovered as this kind of price structure reveals itself continuously in the Forex, Stock and other markets.  
  
**I will be continuously improving the first post with information concerning the method and as we make progress.**  
  
ISR stands for  
I - Induce  
S - Stop Hunt  
R - Run for profit  
  
These are the three elements that you will find in price. Some times it's clear and sometimes it's not. Stocks are my favourite when it come to this then follows currency since they do move in a similar but not exact way.  
  
  
**1.****Bullish** and **Bearish** **Sentiment**  
  
Before we are able to start talking about trade setups we need to first talk of bullish and bearish sentiment.  
We may all have different views and theories of how the market moves up and down but what we all have in common is that we search for repetitive things in it in order to make a profit.  
  
In stocks for the**ISR Method** we will use the weekly time frame but for forex and metals like silver we will be using the 4hr time frame.  
  
These time fames were not chosen at random as over time they have proven to work well in sentiment direction which is an advantage for the trade set up.  
  
The charts are to be kept as clean as possible from any other indicators except for the 3 ema wave(Thank you Raghee Horner) which have the settings of...  
**60 ema High - Gree n**  
**60 ema Close - Blue**  
**60 ema Low - Red**  
  
**Stock Bull and Forex Bull**  
  
Whenever the Weekly candle for stock closes above the ema wave then we are in a bullish sentiment.  
Whenever the 4Hr candle closes for fore closes above the ema wave then we are in a bullish sentiment.  
  
  
**Stock and Forex Bear**  
Whenever the Weekly candle for stock closes below the ema wave then we are in a bearish sentiment.  
Whenever the 4H candle closes below the ema wave then we are in a bearish sentiment.  
  
**Stock and Forex Sentiment**

**  
  
  
Without this sentiment we wont be able to better direct our trade set ups and might be entering into trade contrary to the trend as we seek products(Stock or currency pairs) that show a consistency in trend movement.  
  
**2**.**I SR Structure**  
For The Trade Setup we will be using a one hour chart for forex and a Daily time frame for Stock  
  
I will be discussing the setup structure then later ill talk of it in details. Sentiment is the key to be able to trade this setup effectively  
  
**(A) Induce**  
The first thing that the market makers will do is that they will induce you to go in the right direction at the wrong time. They do this by provoking you to see that the market is going up or down at that time with moves that seem what positive in that direction  
  
**(B)** **Stop Hunt**  
The stop hunt is followed after the induction to take out stop losses along with inducing you to go in the wrong direction. The Induction with the stop hunt is a classical **ISR method** price action structure.  
  
**(C)** **Run for Profit**  
After the stop hunt the market makers then begin to move the price in the intend direction to make a profit. this is seen by a push up or down in a zig zag manner.  
This is to serve to build up an understand of the price structure of a trade, and I will be going into detail concerning this as we progress father.

For stocks we look for these structure on a daily time frame and then for forex and other markets(will give details later) we look for the set up on the H1  
If you try go down to the 15min you will find setups along with the perfect opportunity of frustration and getting burned.  
  

**3\. The Anatomy of a Trade Setup**

  
**I am in conflict** between first releasing the ISR threading skill post or the entry setup post, nevertheless I will first speak of **the ISR trade setup** then at a later stage introduce **the ISR threading****skill**.  
  
a) We have previously established that we do not trade except for the trade being in **the direction of the sentiment**. There will always be setups that appear in the direction that the sentiment doesn't point, but to be a successful trend trader means that we do not trade all trends especially those that do not fall inline with our sentiment.  
  
b) **After the Stop hunt we wait for price candle to pop up(if buying) or pop down(if selling) and close. We then wait for price to have a pull back candle or a doji that closes( some form of resistance) then finally anticipate a candle that will break the previous resistant candle'- Important!**  
  
c) The Stop loss will be place just below the ema wave as seen on the image with a risk to reward ratio of 1:2( will explain at a later stage the reason)

Not very clear the sentiment rule.  
How many candles you need to be closed above/below indicator bands?

Price closes below so should be bearish.  
What happened next?   
Immediately after a complete reversal but sentiment was supposed to be bearish.

Wrong. You are looking at H1 chart, H4 candle did not close below the EMAs.

I'm sorry, but I have a question. Can there be a HUNTING STOP LEVEL greater than 1 ? Or does my installation not match?

There will be calibrations that will be added on at a later stage(especially with forex) but we will get there when we are finished with certain concepts in the method

Hi Informed  
  
I do not have very clear is your rules for ISR steps  
For long position  
Induce - Do you mean a breakout above the H4 candle that indicates bullish direction?  
Stop hunt level - Do you mean the lowest swing point created after the inducement ?  
Entry *Is your entry taken after price croosed the stop hunt level and closed avobe?  
  
Run for profit - I let the choice open to each taste  
  
Thank you for you answer  
Gerald

Good thread,  
  
I use EMA 240 and only close/high to determine levels (or EMA 240 HA on MT4). But same trading.  
  
Note that EMA 240 4 H = EMA 60 12H  
  
if you play with the TFs and EMAs you can build the structure of the markets

I think you have levels on a completely different system, the graph is very compressed (it's hard to see)

Greetings  
  
Thank you so much for your interest in The ISR method. What you are saying might seem like an advantage but there will be Gaps in your sentiment within the scope of the ISR method. I've been here before but it disadvantaged me in the method.  
  
Much appreciated

Good Thread, Informed, I also trade via MA Channels High/Low breakouts, but different. MA Channels do work for variety of reasons. This is an interesting spin on it.  
  
Questions:  
  
1\. How do we gage that price now is above Stop Hunt, price could be back and forth Stop Hunting.  
  
2\. As an example for a Buy trade, after we determine that Stop hunting is finished, we then wait for Pop Up candle **to close** above the High Channel, then for Reversal candle and then entry as PA breaks High of the reversal Candle?  
  
3\. What happens if it was a real momentum breakout and Reversal candle is too far from the High of the Channel?  
  
4\. Why do we need a middle Channel(I am sure there is a use for it)?  
  
Suggestion: Let's stick for now with examples for Forex Pairs and CFD Indices.

HI Informed, your system becomes clearer and more defined. Thank you for your constant explanations.  
It seems to me that the key level is the "stop hunt level", because when a candlestick closes above this level, and then a pullback occurs, an entry could happen soon after. So, could you please clarify your method to draw the stop hunt level correctly? Thanks.

Why you don't open buy trade at the close of the candle which break the stop hunt level?

Please read Post 1. The entry is at the break of the PB candle after a close above/below the stop hunt level.

I agree with you, stop hunter level is the key but for me I don't understand very well where to place stop hunter level (for example on AUDUSD H1 chart above, for the recent bullish sentiment on H4).

The marked level on H1 **could** become a stop hunt level, but it is not (yet). You will know if it is broken to the downside and then price closes above. After a pull back and break of the candle, this would be your entry.  
  
Study the posts of Informed and you will understand.

Okay thank you. Just thought it will be worthwhile to note where the stop hunt level resides before the stop hunt PA manifests.

Sorry but I don't understand what is wrong with my buy setup below?

On the [chart](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/image/4475146?d=1686252362) on post #1 it is noted: Entry at high of the pull back candle?  
  
But when we must open a trade: at the next close/open candle, when the price break the high of pull back candle?

New account long time trader.  
  
I created a script/indicator with PineScript on TradingView that sits at the top of the chart. These dots represent the EMAs on the 4H - dots will be BLUE if price is above the bands, red if they’re below, and not appear if they’re in between. This indicator makes seeing setups at a glance infinitely easier but not necessary at all.

Greetings  
  
The ISR Method is a new concept to many, so there will be abit of confusion just like a small child beginning to walk.   
  
For some they will be able to catch the concepts as soon as they read the first post on the thread but for some it will take time( we all don't understand at the same pace)   
  
Remember I am still adding information on the first post so that we may all come to the same page(there are concepts I still need to add on).   
  
I'd like to thank those that have been assisting the others to understand (much appreciated).   
  
The Stop hunt level will be mastered by you in due time(don't panic)   
  
We are on a journey not a small trip so please give yourself time to get the concepts with patients

I don’t think this setup is has a high win rate… with the indicators added to my chart I can clearly see when h4 candles cross bands and I can see see the price hint and a lot of times price doesn’t run after.   
  
it’s a sound concept, but it’s still a gamble wether it not price decides to run or not   
  
this is normal 1h chart with htf bands (blue) and htf candles

I do hope your moving to the traditional ISR method indicator with no addition of scripts that I haven't checked for consistency in the method  
  
Then also to add - your issue is calibration in the Forex market that you still haven't come to fully understand compared to the simple price action in the stock market.   
  
I have posted certain pairs to help you begin to walk like a new born child into the ISR method.  
  
And yes you now have your eyes opened to see how often the market makers keep coming back for your stop which varies in different pairs and markets

The setup that he posted is the set up on the first post.  
  
The entry is not at the close of the candle but at the high of the pullback candle

Yes, Got It. Few questions:  
  
1\. How do we gage that price now is above Stop Hunt? Price could be back and forth Stop Hunting.  
  
2\. What happens if it was a real momentum breakout and Reversal candle is too far from the High/Low of the Channel?  
  
3\. Why do we need a middle Channel?

**GOLD**  
  
Although price action on gold looks rather untidy but by the rules it may be appropriate to place a buy stop above 1965.46?

Yes... Just that Gold can be tricky  
  
Do you have a stock demo to also practice on? Ora cfd stock broker like [cmc markets](/brokers/cmc-markets "View CMC Markets Broker Profile")

Great post bro! Very detailed and easy to understand. I will code a MT5 indicator and MT5 EA based off of the setup. Keep up the great work

Good Idea for MT5, what would be the rule/condition "if, then" to measure that Stop Hunting is over - that is the most tricky part that I cannot figure out the answer to.  
  
Of course PA will do what PA will do, but what would be the starter rule for it?

Well we can avoid the stop hunting if we wait to trade on each trend change (soon as the bullish sentiment is confirmed we buy, soon as the bearish sentiment is confirmed we sell).   
  
Will have a better idea once I finish coding in all of the requirements, then I can look at it visually in the strategy tester to see if its working as intended.

Hi Informed,  
  
The strategy says that we enter buy stop above the high of the pull back bar. Is there a set allowance to be given or it is discretionary;  
and again where the stop hunt level is far from the EMAs and price close back above the SHL, in this case where do we put the stop loss?  
Still below the EMAs?  
do you also sometimes move trades to break-even after some positive pips?  
  
Thanks

**The M15 Breeze Setup**

  
Greetings **I SR** Brothers and Sisters  
  
My hearts and desire is to share the knowledge of the financial markets with nothing held back and nothing charged at any price except for _**the price of your willingness to learn**_. I was inspired by such traders like Trader101(who is late) who without a reason shared freely his discoveries in the forex market.  
  
My Friend**Breeze** bought to my attention something interesting that I have over looked but may be proving to be of some great advantage in the forex market, therefor Iv decided to dedicate this trade setup in his name for **the good heart** he has shown towards me in the financial market.  
  
**I will link this post to the first page since i am no no longer able add any more pictures cause of the limit.**  
  
**The M15 Breeze Setup**  
  
1\. We start of with **the sentiment as always on the H4**  
2\. We then **find our SHL on the H1**(remember its the low or high of the induction)  
3\. Then we drop to the M15 to trade the entry  
\- If bullish the entry will be above the ema wave and SHL  
- If bearish the entry will be below the ema wave and SHL  
\- The Stop loss will be place below or above the ema wave  
  
We are basically waiting for **price to stop hunt first on the SHL** then come back to **Run for profit.** My brother Breeze bought to me attention the time in which the Markey makers will be moving the price which is the London or New York session.  
This might seem like it has been over preached to be a revelation of some sort but the interesting setups that have come from this acknowledgement have me thinking.  
  
4\. When the price action confirms a bearish swing in the London new York or creates a new swing within the session that is where we enter for a risk to reward ratio of 1:2(**See images for explanation**)

Posting trades Rules for**the Breeze setup**  
  
\- **All post are to have three charts for this setup**  
a) The H4 Sentiment Chart  
b) The H1 Chart for SHL  
c) The M15 Chart with marked SHL,Entry and SL( add take profit if trade has been closed)  
I posted pairs on the first post that are less of a headache then the others.

Tha main question for Stop Hunts, is, when is it logical to conclude that Stop Hunt is finished and now it is time to look for Run for Profit?

That is fine, you are entering "the bounce" and early, as I would, but you are not entering **above the SHL**(per author suggestion).  
  
I propose entering above the SHL is too late for R:R

Informed, most of us, who are left understand your technique. As you are not posting your reasoning to get into the trade a bit late, i .e above the SH, we are expanding our research into the earlier entries.

May I ask, Why **60** EMA?   
  
**I am not questioning the method here** , just **asking** if there is any **particular reason** for using **60** EMA, instead of any other EMA. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

The reason why you look for entries above the Stop Hunt level is because it's the place where you know that the stop hunting is likely to have ended and the proberbility of a move up or down is possible.  
  
It's an after the stop hunt enty.  
  
The hunger for an earlier entry always exist but for that one early trade that works alot more trades not rightly executed will burn.

Earlier I used the 34 then the 50 but after I switched to the 60 my entry accuracy improved. You don't have to struggle where I struggled.

It would be nice to have custom indicators for the ISR method  
  
For mt4/Mt5 and TradingView   
  
So if you have any experience coding please talk to me.

One thing I was hesitant to say or post about is my experiment of the same logics used on the M15 used on the 5min.  
  
But that is still highly expiremental... As long as the entry is above the SHL(IMPORTANT)

I suggest, do not go for 5 or 15 Min, it is TMI and brings confusion. I would just stick with 4 Hr and 1 Hr timeframes.  
  
I am a convert myself. I traded my spin on MA Channels on 15 Min, but 2 years ago converted to an 1 Hour TF and have not looked back.

This is outside of your technique but just to give content for 1 Hour TF, these are my trades yesterday and today, 1 and 2 are "bad trades" and 3 is a great long trade, total profit +3%. I posted my trades, there is allot more to it that I am not showing, This is just an example. {image}

Informed, looking closely at your technique, what you are really doing is entering pullback #2 and above the Stop Hunting. I like to enter on the first pullback.  
Obviously both methods have Pros and Cons. Positive: Both methods entering on the momentum of the new trend.

could we apply the same logic to different time frames you think? Like 15m and 1M on the indices since they move 3X faster and so much more liquid?

from my experience 15m and 1m react well with eac

There is an indicator created in TradingView based on this logic but they use smaller time frames.  
  
This concept derived from ICT concepts right?  
  
They seem to be concerned with volume spikes more than anything when it comes to the stop hunt part  
  
ah I see he writes this in the description - I'm aware that ICT doesn't use volume as part of his analysis, and often advocates against using volume altogether, however I personally find it to be a great analytical tool in this context.

Informed, what do you think? Looks quite appealing… price breaks previous swing low while simultaneously showing an aggressive volume spike insinuating a stop hunt and smart money is at play. Entry at the SL on the way back up

Greetings  
  
My back ground is Richard D Wyckoff VSA and raghee horner  
  
I have a friend currently trading the ICT trading style but as you can see I use the ema wave which would be looked down upon.  
  
My Love was the Richard D Wyckoff schematics which embedded the knowledge of Stop hunts and Inductions and in being in the markets I have been able to see how this happens beyond the richard D Wyckoff schematics and trading style.   
  
I would love to study ICT(hopefully as soon as possible since iv been hearing good news about him) but for now I'm a ISR method trader

Great trades...you should take one or two trades and show how they developed, 4 Hr, 1 Hr, 15 Min. and you rationale with fractals. I am not sure if 1 Hr is needed anymore.

I suggest keep it simple, 4 Hr, 1 Hr.  
  
3 time frames, including 15 Min = TMI and whipsaws.

Yellow line is SHL level drawn with H1 chart. I drawn this line with the help of fractals indicator (blue bullet for a buy induction).  
  
Blue line is drawn only with M15 chart. I place a buy pending order on blue line level => it is high of the pull back level (red bullet fractals on this M15 chart).

I debuted in the thread with an operation, although I've been following it for days. Thanks for sharing.  
Testing a possible configuration in GBPNZD with H4 and H1, is it correct?  
One question, if the retracement candle is followed by several retracements, does the buy level also adjust to the new high of each bearish candle?

I have not explained myself well, I mean if there are, for example, 3 bearish candles in the retracement, the buy stop order would be on the maximum of the first bearish candle or we would go down to the new maximums of the bearish candles formed, in this case about the high of the third bearish candle?

Do we absolutely need third time frame, it’s definitely overwhelming. The 15M time frame seems to just be there for pin point entries, but with such large stop losses, doesn’t seem entirely necessary

The M15 Breeze Setup is a setup in the ISR method.. You basic entry is to use only the H4 and H1  
  
If you have a huge stop-loss in the M15 your doing something wrong.

Sorry for the long delay, here is the indicator I built off of this method.  
  
It's using the forex method described for the 4 hour sentiment chart with 1Hour setup chart.

This will probably need some edits so please test and let me know if you spot anything off or see anything that can be improved.  
  
I will be finishing the EA version as soon as we confirm that the indicator version is working completely as intended.

Greetings  
  
Thank you for you work concerning an indicator to assist with the sentiment identification without a need to switch to the H4 time frame.   
  
I will be testing it by this weekend since I'm on a road trip at the moment.

When switching through different time frames the trendline stays flat in one direction sometimes, but it recovers after a few more switches. And there is an Error "Array out of Range":

Greetings  
  
Concerning indicators for the ISR method ill be giving guidance. I'm in contact with the coder so that a good indicator for the ISR method is given which will be to assist with the technical analysis.  
  
The image doesn't portray what the ISR method is yet, but hope is not lost because we are a work in progress and we will eventually get it right.

Thank you for the feedback!! Concerning both issues, I will lower the candles to calculate and give an input in the options. The default is set to 2000 candles.

As I understand from the first post, SHL is at the lowest low of a bearish candle (in an uptrend) or the high of a bullish candle (in a downtrend) or a doji candle. I don't know if I think that's right, if I'm wrong, please correct me. thank you very much

That's why I asked why SHL is not on the first bearish candle that I marked in the picture. Can you explain this case to me. i will be very grateful

On H4 EURUSD chart, it's always bullish sentiment, you must take only buy order on H1 and/or M15.

You are wrong, 4 HR TF EURUSD, June 2 is a bearish sentiment and a loss on 1 HR TF(lower chart).

Of course Losses Happen all the time, that does not mean anything, if Strategy is sensible and one is overall a winner after 20-25 trades. This is not related to Informed Strategy, but I also use 1 Hour TF MA Channel as a base. Here is my Equity line for the last week...I circled losses.

Friendly and the Last Warning(jokingly): 15 Min will complicate entries and most of all it will complicate Stop Losses.

That was a very good and patient trade.  
  
Informed, do you not think that 10 hours waiting for induce and 21 hours for entry is too long(see area with arrow) and PA has a different motive now then before? Would you say it is a high risk trade because of it? In my personal trading, patterns are obsolete after 5-10 hours.

Induce in Tokyo session, Stop hunt in London session and Entry in New york session that is the best timing for a trade. Me personally, the total time from Induce to Entry is no more than 24 hours and Entry will be best in London to New york session.  
  
You can check my M15 chart to see it more clearly.

GBPNZD buy stop at 2.06165. SL 2.05715 and TP 2.07065  
  
This buy stop was deleted for risk management reasons. But lets see how it plays out eventually

Thank you very much for your observation. I have really tried to go through the post carefully and can not understand what I am doing wrong. I had to get out of the trade because of lack of confidence, even though it eventually played out. I have attached the chart for the basis for my entry. Please kindly review and let me know what I am doing wrong. Like you mentioned we all learn at different pace.  
  
Thank you for your time

I'm still learning this system myself, I'm not an expert, I've read the material from the first page carefully and I'm trying to trade. Not all trades are successful. Your entry was not bad in my opinion...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Here's the updated version of the indicator:  

Attached File(s)

![File Type: ex5](https://assets.faireconomy.media/images/attach/ex5.gif) [ISR v1.1.ex5](/attachment/file/4484888?d=1687448574) 20 KB | 264 downloads 

  
  
  
The bottom window/separate window shows us the current sentiment of the 4 hour timeframe (red is bearish, beige is neutral, and blue is bullish). As soon as the 4 hour sentiment switches, it will automatically switch. The window will **only** show the _4 hour sentiment_ , even if your chart is on a _different_ timeframe.  
  
The arrows are based off of the **1 hour setup** that _Informed_ explained, however we are still updating the SHL. Currently you will see a buy arrow if the 4 hour sentiment is bullish, and the previous candle closed above the 1 hour wave. You will see a sell arrow if the 4 hour sentiment is bearish, and the previous candle closed below the 1 hour wave. For now, don't take the arrows**blindly**. Use your knowledge of the SHL and only take the setups that align with your analysis.  
  
Once we add in the SHL to the indicator, then I will have the candles changing colors based upon the 4 hour sentiment. Then lastly I will make it into an expert advisor.

The question is what was the sentiment at that time? Then secondly you do not have the EMAs

Umm I have considered making one for MT4, but MT4 will be discontinued this fall, so it may not be worth it.  
  
I will make one if we have enough requests for it

we will always have time to open an order (I think this is not necessary in this topic), but to understand the price movement itself is the most important thing!!!

You did nothing wrong IMO. The trade didn't go as envisaged. It is part of the game

The MARKETS are not free markets determined by random price movement but markets that move influenced by those able to see both sides of the markets(market makers), these price movement can be understood and modelled to take advantage of price for a profit.

**THE M15 BREEZE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY**

  
Greetings** ISR** traders, I would like to establish **the M15 breeze setup as a good way to engage in the crypto market**. Crypto currencies can have a really great structure which allows for a good solid ISR setup to form along with its great price movement out of the ISR trading range.  
  
Pairs with the USDT are the most suitable in that they give less of a pain in choppy market environments. The beautiful thing concerning this market is not that its open 24/7(fools game to trade and time) but its unlike stocks that doesn't allow for a leveraged position(not all the time).  
  
The one main change in trading the M15 Breeze for this market is that **you look for the entries between the US Open and Asian Close**  
  
Every thing else is the same and should the be other changes I will up date this post![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

On your chart, as a rule, SHL is drawn under the first red Candle low on 4 Hr Chart, correct?  
  
If not correct, can you or someone who understands explain why SHL is where you have it and not as an example where my blue lines are, **what is the rule to draw an SHL line** where you drew a line for SHL?

Greetings to all! I would like to take this opportunity to express my wholehearted gratitude to Informed for the invaluable contributions he made in initiating and upholding this thread.  
  
your unwavering dedication and tireless efforts are truly praiseworthy.  
  
When considering the system itself and from a technical standpoint, it is more accurate to classify this system as trend-following rather than a reversal system. This distinction provides a significant advantage, as trend-following strategies tend to yield favorable results in many scenarios, further enhancing its edge.

**The Anatomy of a Stop Hunt Level**

IMPORTANT!!! 

  

**1\. What is a Stop Hunt Level**

SHL stand for stop hunt level or rather a place where the market makers(syndicate traders) come back to trigger stop losses along with convincing you to go the wrong direction. The place where you will find the SHL is the place where there are alot of emotions of **fear** because it's the place where you were convinced by the price action to place your stop loss. This place is what we at the ISR method call the stop hunt level.  
  

**2\. Where is a SHL**

The Stop hunt level is found below the low of the swing for a bull market and on top of the swing high for a bear market. You may have more than one SHL to consider but the one that's the best to consider will be the one that is at the lowest point of the Stop hunt for a bull market and at the highest point for a bear market.  
  
**When you practice with patience you will develop a skill to be able to find the best SHL with ease.**  
  

**​​​​​​3. How to find the SHL**

  
  

In the forex and crypto market we look for the Stop Hunt Level(SHL) in the H1 time frame.

  
**Step1**  
**Look for a bull-bear-bull candle formation above the ema wave(for bull market.**  
What we are really looking for is a swing, a place that entices traders to enter the market and encourage them to put their stop losses at the lows.  
For this first step it may be that the three candle formation is not what appears but **a bullish swing with a high-low-higher high.** The low of that swing is the perfect place you are seduced to place your stop loss.  
  
Please remember according to the **I SR Method** this**first high must be above the ema wave** then the bear can be lower or higher than the ema wave then later there higher high(a bullish price swing)  
  
In a live market environment you would draw the highest LOW to the top then plot also the SHL's that the price might also come to should the stop hunt drop any lower.  
You will know that it's the lowest point that the market will hunt by the reaction in this area along with a entry of the M15 Breeze Setup in the M15 time frame.

Important variations  
Bull candle/candles - doji - bull candle/candles  
Bull candle/candles - dragon fly - bull candle/candles  
Bull candle/candles - inside bar - bull candle/candles  
Bull candle/candles - hammer - bull candle/candles  
  
**Step 2**  
After you have drawn the SHL watch how the market comes to the level and rejects the low. This is where the people with **the stop losses are triggered** and discouragement is high for that trade long direction. When you see the price come to this level and close above it then you know you might have found the perfect sweet spot. The price might continue to play around this level or go even lower to another SHL.

**Step 3**  
The M15 time frame will show you when the MM are ready to move the price out of this trading range by raising the price above the SHL and ema wave with a following bull-bear-bull swing or you can call it a zig zag(In the right market session)

Thank you bro.. How to spot the SHL noted very well... Next that I am still confused on is how to enter a trade, because sometimes price after breaking the SHL and pulls back it will still go back to the SHL area again and still comes back making me confused on how or when to enter, I will be watching closely to see if you will touch more hint on the entry aspect of this.

By your question I can tell that you read the 1st post quickly and didn't take the time to digest every point made in it.   
  
I have posted more information concerning the SHL but you will need to also go back and reread the 1st post to get all the details you need..

Quasimodo or Over-Under pattern was coined by a ForexFactory member. It has been incorporated into Supply & Demand strategies which are different from ICT concepts.  
[https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...brainer-trades](https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/86429-no-brainer-trades)  
[https://paracurve.com/2009/06/over-a...r-pattern.html](https://paracurve.com/2009/06/over-and-under-pattern.html)  
  
In reality, it's actually a classic chart pattern called a Crown (Bullish or Bearish Crown) which incorporates a trendline break. It's a form of head of shoulders except that you attempt to get in earlier on the Right Shoulder instead of after the break of the neckline. Some people include Fib Retracement and Extension levels and becomes a modified Gartley pattern. Some people wait for the previous swing to be broken first. It's up to you how you want to incorporate different technical analysis methodologies to improve the edge. Just be aware it might end up causing more analysis paralysis, missed moves or frequent stop-outs.

An old video explaining the concept of the Crown.  

Inserted Video

  
  
At the end of the day, the phenomenon being traded here is a break of structure (indicating a possible reversal) and a retracement. You can trade it as a HTF big reversal, or as continuation pattern itself on a LTF as part of a HTF trend.  
  
I agree that ICT and his bandwagoners dress up what are basic chart patterns with a lot of unnecessary jargon. If you're studied classic TA patterns, then you realise it's a lot of repackaging though I do combine some ICT concepts as an alternative form of TA.

You're welcome. TTrades is great. He explains ICT concepts succinctly.  
  
I'm also exploring a similar concept where i'm attempting to ride a trend shown by an EMA but entering after a Stop-Hunt (after Liquidity has been taken).

Inserted Video

[/quthe ote]  
the ISR is in fact a QM setup, however, it's a trend-following system - Continuation QM.  
what I've noticed with the video shared is, he`s showing Reversal QMs.  
  
which is risky business, traders love to pick tops and bottoms 

if you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough

That's okay. The setup is not ripe yet, it might as well do whatever it likes. And by the way trades are supposed to come with stop loss for capital preservation in case the market does the unexpected. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f600.png?v=15.1)

What do you think if we use SL above / below the Stophunt zone, and TP with R:R 1:1 for every trades?  
I have EP 1 stopped out too.

Hi, all  
Thanks Informed for posting,  
I agreed with this idea, I have another idea to make the entry on the chart for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes to avoid a lot of loss (recently I had a lot of it using the 15 min. chart for entry). It is only my opinion.

15 Min is an account killer. I trade MA Channels and prefer working with 1 Hr TF.

Thanks Informed for starting this thread. Trading systems are normally full of indicators and indicators are lagging so people prefer to trade price but it is very difficult to trade right price at the right place. Your trading method is based on trend that is indeed a great idea to trade in the direction of sentiments. I will definitely follow this thread and test it. I found 4 hr and 1 hr tf better.  
Thanks again.

It has been a while and no hearing from Informed. He's not been online too since June 30th, quite unusual of him.  
Hoping all is well at his end.

Very grateful and looking forward to your upcoming post. Usually you will watch 1 pair until the hunt is over and then move on to another pair, or is there a tool to mark the pairs you are following? Thank you very much

EURJPY  
Sell stop again deleted having reached another SHL. But H4 bearish close below the MA waves is still intact so may still get a new sell stop signal.  
  
In the meantime we have other pairs to watch: EURNZD and EURAUD  
  
I will appreciate the input from others. Just trying to test my understanding of the strategy

Lovely thread. Point of note. The Inducement Stop Hunt Run for profits is a great model but I would like to point out that its not always the case that the Market Maker as you call it is after your stops especially in a trending market. In most instances they are exiting their positions slowly as retail money and the crowd steps in to ride the wave. Since the logic is pullback = entry and Market Maker sells to Retail who buys their exit positions. Also from most of the charts shared if you look closely the price pulls back not to look for stops but address the issue of volume imbalance especially where there are fair value gaps. These zones are places where price retraced to then launched to higher highs. The premise was not necessarily stop hunts but volume imbalance as smart money could not put all their orders at once.   
Good thread by the way. Following keenly.

**The Origin**

**The Sweet spot of ISR**

  
To be a succefull trader we do not trade all trends just like we do not trade all trade setups. Some setups are more valuable than others and some others of less standard and value.  
  
I believe this post should make you as profitable as possible in the Stock Crypto and Forex market trading the ISR method.  
  
**Today you put yourself on the map as a profitable trader** as in mastering the structure of the market within the ISR framework you have positioned yourself to be in a better spot than the 90% of traders(unless they join us)  
  
**The ISR Threading post is to follow** but before it does we have to discus the origin of the sentiment which is the sweet spot of the ISR method setup.  
  
When we have inducements and stop hunts in the beginning of the move we are at a better chance of making a profit than when we try to enter the market when it's at a place for a reversal(sudden)  
  
**The further away from the origin or the conception of the sentiment the more likely the setup will not yield the desirable outcome.**  
  
_**The first two setups from the conception of the sentiment are the sweet spots before we catch a big move**_ , the others are good since we have a good understanding of the ISR structure but may not yield at times what we desire for as profitable trade.  
  
**ISR will put you on the map once you engage your focus mainly on the sweet spot which is the origin of the sentiment.**  
  
There is no need for me to go into depth concerning the entry style because it is exactly what you have been doing and it is what I have always been posting on.  
  
**_The emphasis thus follows_**  
A) **Trade mainly the 1st ISR structure** that emerges after the sentiment is established  
B) Trade the 2nd ISR structure should you miss or the 1st structure was unclear  
C) _**Slam dunk that trade with a risk of 1:5**_  
D**) Move stop loss to break even as soon as the trade reaches a 1:1.5 or 1:2(its your choice)**  
E) I mainly leave the sl at break even until TP  
D)**Don't you dare complain about lack of trades !!!**  
G) You may also exit the trade when the price touches the 3ema wave on the H4 for as much pips as you want after the 1:5 target is met.  
  
**_The Reset_**  
The reset of the Sentiment for the Origin is when the price on the H4 touches the ema wave then afterwards has a bullish close(for bull sentiment) or Bearish close(for Bearish Sentiment) - basically after the sentiment has been established but price then comes back to the 3ema we rinse and repeat since it is a restart of the origin.  
  
You have seen the setup work now we put it in the sweet spot.  
  
**_I have pledged to with hold no information from you but to do my best to release it in a way that will benifit and at a pace I can be able to teach with no headache_**.  
  
I hope this will help you to start concluding the ISR method approach even though in the market we are always learning.

Hi, Informed  
Thank you for the input, respect. And I believe that this will change our profitability ... I know that this is not a scalping methodology, a certain period of time must pass to see ....  
What are your favorite stocks that you use for this method on trading view if you use them at all?

So, again, it's not a very clear signal. But in my opinion it can be detected as a sign. You can see the black reverse candle and then induce on mine H1 chart, differently than on your H1 chart... different brokers..

looks like you used to be TP 5R. Consider a sell limit trade GBPNZD

I personally take it once, after that I'm already looking for another SH, unless Informed corrects it.

Hi Informed,  
Sorry for my impatience ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f603.png?v=15.1)  
One more question about the reset of the Sentiment if you don't mind... which does not give me peace.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f92b.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have three options of reset of the Sentiment. First clear ...price just touches the ema wave then afterwards has a bearish close. Then we continue look setups according origin bear sentiment, ok.   
But other two when price goes deeper to wave, can be considered valid variants as a restart of the origin sentiment? Pictures below

Hi Informed. Interesting thread!   
Sorry if this was already answered, but I just need to clarify, must the price **touch** the Emas when it stop hunts on the SHL? Which timeframe do we look at, H1 or M15?

Please correct me if I am wrong. I think your entry was rather late. Base on M15 the entry should have been around 1.10680 as highlighted below?

Hi Gleam. Yea I saw this too... I have a question. If the H4 touches back into the MA, that means this setup is now invalid, is that correct?  
GBPNZD H4 Now

Thank you for the clarification! So only when the H4 candle closes on the other side of the wave. Got it. So for now, the buy sentiment is still valid!

The idea of the method is look like of one of the principles of PVSRA.   
At the PVSRA we see the P.A do a zig-zag pattern, price ends the stophunt in the region 2.07000 (Whole Level), accumulates below the 200 EMA with notable volume (changing the positions) and rises above the region 2.07250 (Quarter Level), above the Dragon EMA (EMA WAVE) too. In PVSRA is a Trend Validated Trade for 20 pips (more or less)  
  
I know you will find answers to these moves the more you work on your method, stay green bro.

For the purpose of clarification, I exited because I was not too comfortable with the rejection that happened previously. And of course LUCK. We all need it

This is just my observation in this case, the price is too far from the H4 ema. You already had perfect setup yesterday on this .. I would wait price back to ema wave, close bullish candle and after continue look for buy setup...but anyway it up to you, can be perfect, gold gold..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yea, for now I would just try out in demo to get a feel of the strategy. The best is always first setup from the H4 I think.

Loss trade GBPNZD  
I guess I was suppose to wait for a new SHL to be taken out and start the process all over again. I hope this is correct Gleam? Maybe Informed may wish to give further clarifications here

Hi Gleam,  
So the candle if it closes within the EMA wave, is it invalid? If it's bullish but still inside the EMA, is that also invalid? Hope you can clarify when H4 sentiment becomes invalid, because you said yesterday that as long as the candle does not close on the other side of the EMA wave, it stays valid (Post 380)

Yes, your questions in this post are similar to mine. Just needed to be sure where a sentiment becomes valid/ invalid exactly when the candles are within the EMA wave.

Is this H1 SHL valid for bullish setup despite that it is formed inside the wave but not below? This is not very clear for me[Attachment g](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/file/4508883)

your idea was good with gold, that was my idea too.   
you don't see any order size or volume, so you couldn't see that the poc left 1977 is the most traded volume that was sold on the future.   
better to buy at the bottom and sell at the top.  
your waves and lines unfortunately do not always help you.

Dear Kette

Hi, Informed..!  
Good Thread (Keep it up)  
  
Could you please share the M15 picture of this chart too? (with the lines of EP, SL & 1:2 TP)  
As, it is in range and difficult for me to find the exact EP & SL line according to Rule.  
  
Thanks 

Ahmad Hassan

Hi, As, I am also new in this method and just reading this thread.  
I think your trade is correct and meeting all parameters of ISR Breeze Setup Perfectly,   
But As, I guess, you use 1:1 for your trade. Although, it is preferred to use 1:2 RR minimum (it is a part of trade/money management: an important part to follow).

You are spotting nice.  
  
As, I am looking from the both sides, I have added an entry in your chart that results in SL.

I think that is where the Time Of Day filter comes in as the London open swing was yet to be formed. I may be wrong though

Hi Informed…!  
I would like to know that how you look at the news timing? No trading in news timing or just ignore the news and just focus on ISR Method???  
  
Is there any way to trade a Reversal???

Hi everyone,  
I have to ask a few questions.  
Q#1: Can the pullback should always have only one candle? or it may be consist of more than one candles?  
Q#2: If their is an established biasing (bullish/bearish) and after identifying the SHL, while looking for Trade in M15. And eventually, Price enters in the EMAs Band in H4 and giving a signal in M15. Should we enter in market with previous bias, or wait for the H4 candle to close out of EMA Band?  
Q#3: We trade in London/New York session, should we close our entries at end of NY Session, or just this is the rule to take entry only in Ln/Ny Session?  
  
Thanks for answering these questions.  
  
#I was looking for ISR method, and found these difficulties while judging/taking a trade.  
  
Stay Blessed

I want to give some of my thoughts.  
  
1\. Trade with the major trend:  
OP uses four-hour timeframe to check the sentiment. If you have a macro view on a market, you know the sentiment and you won't trade against it. It's in your bone. Sometimes price might pierce the ema(60) channel with opposite direction of the major trend. It's a little dangerous to do purely technical IMO.  
  
2\. Find swing high/low for liquidity:  
OP uses one-hour to find an area where liquidity lies and traders get trapped. I also include higher timeframe to weekly and lower timeframe to 15-minute. Lower timeframes could end up a scalp trade and higher timeframe could end up a positional trade.  
  
3\. Entry on fifteen-minute timeframe  
Although OP uses high, low ema(60) retest and breakout, I could see several setups could be valid and also shares the same idea as OP. Actaully, any reversal setup is good.  
\-------------------  
Everything is fractal. A 4-hour candle is composed of 4 hourly candles, 16 15-minute candles, 48 5-minute candles or 240 1-minute candles. But the macro trend won't change. Lower timeframes give more setups but more fake reversals. So, it's a scalp trade. 1R is good for me. Also you could trade a counter major trend setup here because any pullback from a major trend is large enough for scalping. You need a good hit rate and more trades in scalping. Higher timeframes give less setups but better reversals. Aim for more Rs because you probably get yourself a true reversal. Do not trade against a major trend on higher timeframes because it probably won't turn back.

Very good trade Jewel,  
I enjoyed only one trade in EURUSD this week and my entry was in the candle that is highlighted by you.  
  
Entry was a bit late...!  
Closed Half Position at 1:2 and moved SL to BE  
and the 1:5 triggered on the next day...!

It seems like putting stop orders based on the swing at London opens will help. Time of the day (London open/ New York open) is also an important component of the strategy.

Of course nothing is foolproof. Just increase the odds in our favour

This seems to be part of the PVSRA strategy. In fact, if you choose a trending strategy, then the NRTR indicator will also work. The only question is which symbols to trade on. And that's where stocks come in, because they are more prone to recoilless trends.
