Hello all,  
  
I have been a lurker on this forum for more than a few years. I have decided to give back to the FX community by sharing a trading method that has worked for me, finally, after 5 years of trying. I call it Trend Runner. Before I get into it I would like to first lay down some rules for this thread.  
  
1 - I know the method is not perfect. No method is. If you have something to say about it, please make it constructive. Back up what you are saying.  
  
2 - If you run into any issues or want to ask something, please include a chart pic and add notes. It just makes it easier to see what you are talking about.  
  
3 – Please do not ask me about Eas because I do not believe in them.   
  
4 – If you do not like the method, just leave. We are all here to learn not come down on each other.  
  
5 – Do not be shy to ask questions about the method, but please, do not fill the thread with simple questions that have been answered a million times all over the web. If you do not know what time your broker closes it's candle, figure out, how am I supposed to know.   
  
6- If you are brand new to forex, please learn the basics. I will not answer the basics here.   
  
7- I know that everyone has there own way of trading. I have no issue with you making this system your own, but before you start adding indicators, just try it out the way it is.   
  
OK, now that we have that out of the way lets get started.   
  
TREND RUNNER  
  
Trading Type : Swing Trading  
  
Goal : To catch mid term swings in the direction of the over all trend.  
  
Pairs : Any and all Forex pairs, metals, oils, stocks & CFD's. I use AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF & XAU/USD (GOLD).   
  
Time Frames : 4 Hour and above is recommended. I use 4 Hour.  
  
My broker: [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile").  
  
Indicators: 200 SMA (Levels 50 & -50), Support & Resistance (Barry) & Super Trend. I will include I extra tool called Signal bars Daily. It is not an indicator. You will not base trades off it. It is a MTF tool that shows you the over all strength of each TF for the pair it is on. It also has the daily open, high low pip count and current spread.   
  
Money Management: Everyone has their own risk tolerance. Here I will explain my management. I begin the new month the same way. I begin with my current balance as displayed in my account. To that I add the margin being held by my broker for any current open trades. Finally I add the value of any secured profit on any open trades that have not yet been realized but have been secured by stoploss.  
As a note, if your current trade is against you, be sure to minus the full 2% that was @ risk.   
  
I use this value until the end of the month no matter how many wins or losses I have that month. Why you may ask? My risk is always 2% of balance per trade. But that amount changes with each trade. If I risk 2% after a win & take a loss, it will wipe out more then 2 % of the original balance amount. If I then take a trade based on the after loss balance & use 2% & it is a profitable trade, the amount will be less then I would have made had that amount been based on the original monthly amount. Get it?  
  
Now, because the goal of this method is to catch mid term trends, we need to let the trade breath. I use a static stoploss of 100 pips for each trade on the H4 TF. The beginning of any trade is the highest level of risk you will take when you trade. The goal of trading is to minimize losses and maximize gains.   
  
Management of your trade is important. What I do is once my trade is +30 pips to the good, I move my stop to BE +3. I do that because that will at minimum cover my interest and leave me a bit of profit should the trade go against me. After that point, for every 10 points of movement, I will add another pip to my BE. If, by the time you check, the market has moved in your direction but has come back a little, you will still add 1 pip for every 10 PIPS IT HAS MOVED IN YOUR FAVOR. For example, If the market has moved 100 pips in your favor but is now around say 60 pips, you should have a a BE +10. That way no matter what happens, you will secure 10% of the over all move. There is more below in the explanation of indicators. Please be sure to read that.  
  
I know the above is a bit much to take in and might be a bit confusing. Here are 2 examples that might help:  
  
Example 1:  
June 1st balance = $ 9500. Current margin held by broker $1500 for trade 1 & $1500 for trade 2. Trade 1 has 125 pips secured @ a value of $2 USD a pip. Value $250. Trade 2 has 75 pips secured @ a value of $2 USD per pip. Value $150.   
  
Add it up. 9500 + 1500 + 1500 + 250 + 150 = 12900. This amount, $12900, is going to be the basis of all trades executed during the current month. So I work that out as :  
  
$12900 X 0.02 = $258. Now with a fixed 100 pip stop I divide 258 / 100 = $2.58. If you use MT4 for your trade execution, you will use 0.25 lots per trade. Its always better to round down then up. If, like me, you execute off Oanda FXTrade platform, you will use ( roughly) 25,800 units.   
  
Example 2:  
June 1st balance = $ 9500. Current margin held by broker $1500 for trade 1 & $1500 for trade 2. Trade 1 has 125 pips secured @ a value of $2 USD a pip. Value $250. Trade 2 has -50 pips @ a value of $2 USD per pip. Value -$100.   
  
Add it up. 9500 + 1500 + 1500 + 250 - 200 = 12900. This amount, $12550, is going to be the basis off all trades executed during the current month. So I work that out as :  
  
$12550 X 0.02 = $251. Now with a fixed 100 pip stop I divide 251 / 100 = $2.51. If you use MT4 for your trade execution, you will use 0.25 lots per trade. Its always better to round down then up. If, like me, you execute off of Oanda FXTrade platform, you will use ( roughly) 25,100 units.   
  
Indicators & What They Are Used For:  
  
200 Simple Moving Average (Levels 50 & -50) -

The 200 SMA is the most widely used and accepted Moving Average across all markets. It is especially useful in long term trading. In this method I use the 200 SMA to show the over all trend in the current TF. When price is below the line, I look for only shorts. It helps if the line is also trending down but it is not necessary. If you take a short trade because price closes under, I mean the price, not just if it spikes through, and the 200 SMA is either long or flat, the risk of the trade is higher that it will fail. That does not mean do not trade, it just means the likely hood of failure is high.  
  
Super Trend -

This indicator was developed by Olivier Seban and later on Recoded by Jason Robinson, This indicator has the huge advantage of working on all the time frames in all markets.It is based on average true range (ATR). Blue indicates a bullish trend and red indicates a bearish trend.   
  
Super Trend indicator moving above or below the price depending on the trend developed. Olivier Seban repositioned based on the closing day, which has the main advantage to filter false signals that may occur when the trend slows or during periods without trend. I use it as a confirmation. If overall trend is down, then I will only take trades when this indicator is red and price is below the 200 SMA.

This is a basic support & resistance indicator based on fractals. This indicator REPAINTS until price actually is confirmed a few candles later. This indicator is used as future stoploss levels/profit secure levels.

In the next post I will get into how I trade this method & add the indicators and template.  
  
******************************************************************************************************************************  
  
**_EVERYONE PLEASE READ_**  
  
The S&R levels are used for new Stops/Profit protection. Sometimes, however, they do not show up for a long while which I personally do not mind if the market is just bouncing along. However, if my trades are in deep profit, I can adjust my stops with out waiting for the S&R to show up. You can see new levels of S&R even if you do not see the indi show up. It is a money management decision. If your ok with waiting for them great, if not adjust your trades as you wish.   
  
This thread was started for the method, not the money management. I discussed my money management to give people an idea of what & how I control the trades. I have showed this method to a few colleagues. Some of them liked my MM method, some did not. One of them uses PSARs, I believe his settings are Step 0.02, Maximum 0.2. I actually liked that one but just stuck with mine because it works. He is comfortable with that, I am comfortable with mine. My buddy uses automated Trailing Stops. Some one else moves his stops to every S&R green & red. If it brakes and closes, he moves his stop.   
  
You guys see what I am getting at? You must be disciplined but do not be so rigid that you lose money just because a line didn't show up on your chart. Come up with a MM method that works for you. Don't use mine if you do not believe in it. Make one that works for you, use some of the ones that my colleagues use. The bottom line is, we are here to make some money, lets go make it.  
  
I want read and see what you guys are doing, post some charts and let me know what you guys are trading and what MM method you are using.  
  
Another quick note about creating a MM scheme.   
  
Please go live. Even if it's just a few cents a pip. If you dont, you will find yourself in a world of trouble if you can not handle how your MM works with real money VS demo.

OK, it seems that people are confused. I thought I explained it well but I guess not.  
  
When to enter check list:  
  
PRICE CLOSE ABOVE/BELOW 200 SMA?  
  
YES - MOVE TO NEXT QUESTION  
  
NO - STOP  
  
PRICE CLOSE ABOVE/BELOW SUPERTREND? BLUE FOR LONG, RED FOR SHORT?  
  
YES - MOVE TO NEXT QUESTION  
  
NO - STOP  
  
This seems to be the part that most who do not get it are confused with.  
  
IF THERE IS A ESTABLISHED S&R INFRONT OF YOUR TRADE, LONG OR SHORT, PRICE MUST CLOSE AT LEAST 30 PIPS AWAY FROM THAT ESTABLISHED S&R.  
  
IF THERE IS A ESTABLISHED S&R INFRONT OF YOUR TRADE, LONG OR SHORT, LESS THAT 30 PIPS AWAY, PRICE MUST BREAK AND CLOSE THAT ESTABLISHED S&R BY ANY AMOUNT.   
  
Stop Adjustment:  
  
ONCE PRICE MOVES 30 PIPS IN YOUR FAVOR, ANYTIME DURING OR AFTER INITIAL ENTRY CANDLE, MOVE STOP LOSS TO BE +3.  
  
FOR EVERY 10 PIPS OF TOTAL MOVEMENT, NOT JUST CURRENT PRICE, MOVE BE +1.  
  
MY INITIAL STOP IS 100 PIPS UNLESS THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED S&R THAT IS CLOSER THAN 100 PIPS.  
  
YOUR STOP CAN BE WHAT EVER YOU WANT.  
  
Closing trades:  
  
IF PRICE CLOSES ACROSS SUPERTREND. DOES NOT MATTER ID SUPERTREND CHANGES COLOR OR NOT.  
  
IF PRICE CLOSES ACROSS 200 SMA.  
  
IF PRICE CLOSES ACROSS S&R IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF CURRENT TRADE.  
  
That is all the basics. Every other nick knack question is answered throughout the thread. If you are not going to take the time it read all the answers people & myself graciously posted, that is on you.  
  
But its really not that hard. The system is simple. Do not complicate it.

Now we will start with the basic method of entry. We will also get into advanced entry and exit methods a little later.  
  
Long positions-  
  
I enter long when -  
  
1- price closes above ( IMPORTANT – PRICE MUST CLOSE ABOVE NOT JUST SPIKE THROUGH) the 200 SMA. It should clear the 50 level of the 200 SMA  
  
2- Super Trend is Blue  
Short positions-  
  
I enter short when -  
  
1- price closes below ( IMPORTANT – PRICE MUST CLOSE BELOW NOT JUST SPIKE THROUGH) the 200 SMA. It should clear the -50 level of the 200 SMA  
  
2- Super Trend is Red  
  
Stoploss-  
  
I place a initial stoploss of 100 PIPs on all trades.  
  
Managing Trades-  
  
If/when price moves 30 pips in my direction, I move my sl to + 3. For every 10 pips price moves for me, I add 1 pip to BE. Once a new support/resistance line is confirmed (usually within 3 candles), I move my SL to that line + 3.   
  
My exits are when price takes me out.  
  
That's it for the basics. Here is a screen shot with some notes on how it would work for a long. This is a cherry picked screen shot. I will talk about not so perfect trades in a future post. Also find the indicators and my template.

Thanks for the share, but I have the usual question of STATS! Can you please give your average stats on wins/loss, risk/reward average per trade, and any other relevant info. pairs traded.. you know, that type of thing.

Yes Statistics are important,   
  
Something that could/might improve the system is ATR , every index/security has diffrent range, its not fair to give eurdollar and eurjpy the same 100 pip stop ,eurjpy is on steriods when it move .  
  
If someone has a better understanding of ATR ,this would really help. its just something i noticed recently, i used always put a 30pip stop and 90 pip target, but I realized on the jpy pairs I would either get stopped out real quick or hit target real quick whereas on something like aususd it would take ages.  
  
I personally am struggling to figure out how to read ATr on JPY pairs on mt4 . I met a seasoned long term trader who told me ,its totally unfair to give all trades equidistance stops and targets.

Swing trading is a forex trading strategy where a trading position is traded for medium or long period or attempt to catch bigger pips from bigger period. You have a good swing trading strategy I think. I can learn about swing trading system more from your trading system. Thanks for your shared.

Looks like your S/R is fractal based. So if resistance appears and the high of the next candle is lower @ close it's confirmed. Vice versa for support.

Hey juicyt,  
  
The win/loss ratio is approx 85% over the last 24 months. Full disclosure, a "win" by my standard is ANY TRADE THAT ENDS IN PROFIT. So even if I get 1 pip to the good it is a win. In actuality a win/loss ratio is not a good way to judge a system. With the risk/reward and MY static stop and MY money management method, the percent of trades that achieve a R/R% = 1:1 or < is approx 45% over all pairs traded. The other 65% of the trades fall anywhere in between.  
  
The % of trades the end in a loss over all is roughly 15%. Of those > 25% actually hit the full 2% risk amount (100 pips). Again these numbers are for the last 24 months.   
  
The pairs I trade ( as mentioned above) are currently AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF & XAU/USD (GOLD) through Oanda.   
  
This method, in general, takes many small wins ( protecting capital) fair amount of double digit wins, a few large wins ( amounts in excess off 200 pips) and a rare massive win ( anything over 400 pips).   
  
On the down side the losses are always kept to 100 pips ( 2%) but do not always get that far. There will be many small to average losses in the 30 to 60 pip range. Again this is over the last 24 months.

Hello ashtrader,  
  
As mentioned before you can add anything you like, but might i suggest you try it as is to get the feeling of the system down. Then add anything that makes you more comfortable. As for ATR itself, the supertrend indicator is based on the ATR. If you feel you need to see the number then by all means. The 100 pip static stop is based on MY MM method. Your MM strategy is yours. While I do agree that a static stop is not always ideal, in my case it works for me.   
  
The JPY pairs do tend to hustle in their movements, especially the GBP/JPY, but again, the 100 pip stop has worked for me. Just as it may go against you quickly, it may also get you to BE just as quickly.  
  
If you like and if you do not already have one, I have attached a ATR indi that is adjustable. I do not use it for this method and it is not at all part of this method, but if it helps you in any way please feel free to use it.

You have a good swing trading strategy I think. I can learn about swing trading system more from your trading system.

hey pindang,  
  
Thanks for the kind words. I hope it helps someone the way it has helped me. It is a lot less stressful checking the market a few times a day then sitting in front of my PC all day. I got into trading to help free me not become a slave to my PC. But then again, that's just me. Some people like the action. I like to get my action in other ways.... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hey Anusragger,  
  
Yes as mentioned above, the Support And Resistance (Barry) is based on fractals and it REAPINTS. That is why I mentioned that I wait for it to be confirmed before I move my stop.

Now that we have the basics out of the way, let us get to the nitty gritty of how to trade this method. Lets do it by examples.   
  
Scenario 1 -   
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1182739?d=1367030700)

  
  
As you see, price has moved from below the 200 SMA & closed above the 200 SMA. Supertrend is Blue, price broke and closed above an established resistance point. That is what I like to see. This is a perfect start to a long.   
  
Scenario 2  
  
Price has been above/below the 200 SMA I took a trade but now I'm out, how do I get back in?   
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1182740?d=1367030737)

  
  
If price is bouncing around between S/R, I wait for it to break and close above/below the current established S/R  
  
  
Scenario 3   
  
What if price is above SMA but below the Supertrend & Supertrend is Blue or vice versa? In this situation, I would wait until price closed above a blue supertrend before I take the trade. In the picture below we also have a established resistance point. Before I take this trade, price would need to close above both the supertrend and the resistance point.  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1182741?d=1367030780)

  
  
Scenario 4  
  
In this pic, we see why I like to wait for a break and close of s/r line. If the market is just ranging, its no good to me. This is a 3 week range.

These are the most common scenarios I have encountered. If you come up with any more, please include a pic shot and a brief explanation of what the problem is.

Thanks so much for sharing the system, indicators and template. Can you give an idea of the % you made trading this system over the last 24 months using your money management technique?  
  
I have done some visual backtesting on EU from Jan 13, I spot a few winning trades but also a few problem trades.

So even if I get 1 pip to the good it is a win. In actuality a win/loss ratio is not a good way to judge a system. With the risk/reward and MY static stop and MY money management method, the percent of trades that achieve a R/R% = 1:1 or < is approx 45% over all pairs traded. The other 65% of the trades fall anywhere in between. The % of trades the end in a loss over all is roughly 15%. Of those...

> Yes Statistics are important, Something that could/might improve the system is ATR , every index/security has diffrent range, its not fair to give eurdollar and eurjpy the same 100 pip stop ,eurjpy is on steriods when it move . If someone has a better understanding of ATR ,this would really help. its just something i noticed recently, i used always put a 30pip stop and 90 pip target, but I realized on the jpy pairs I would either get stopped out real quick or hit target real quick whereas on something like aususd it would take ages.

Hey Ash,  
You can use ATR to calculate a different stop for different pairs since they move in different amounts. You need to decide on the correct multiplier but when you get the number that you like, you can continue to use it. For example, put any ATR indicator on your chart. You will notice the # changes for each timeframe. So if you like to trade from the daily timeframe and the ATR shows 80, then you could use 160 for your stop (80x2=160). If it shows 120, then use 240 for the stop (120x2=240). If you find that is too small, take the ATR x 2.5 rather than 2 so if ATR is 80 then stop is 200 (80x2.5=200). If you trade more from 4 HR charts and ATR shows 30, then stop would be 60 (30x2=60). Your targets & stops should be placed from the same timeframe so if you use stop based on 4 HR chart, then pick target from 4 HR chart.   
  
Since eurjpy is more volatile than eurusd, the ATR for ej might show 120 on daily where eu might show 80 so you can use the same multiplier & get a different stop based on how much each pair moves. EJ would have 240 pt. stop & EU would have 160 pt. stop. These are just examples so you need to decide on the best multiplier.   
  
I would also suggest that after you get a stop based on the ATR & multiplier, you should check the chart to see how close it is to a swingpoint & you might want to move it a bit if it makes sense to get it just outside the nearest swingpoint or some support/resistance area.  
  
Hope that helps.

hey pasopvirpo,  
  
I am glad to share. That is what this site is for. Now, as for the visual back test you conducted, let us be realistic here. You only looked at less than 3 months on 1 pair. On the EUR/USD during the time you indicated I captured around 330 pips. This system is designed to take advantage of a portfolio of pairs. That way big swings will be magnified in the two currencies that move the most, USD & JPY. With my MM method that was a return of 6.6% (Compounding profits not included).   
  
The over all average quarterly return, which is how I calculate it, over the last 8 quarters has been roughly 35% (Compounding profits not included).   
  
The return for Q1 2013 is 67.3% (Compounding profits not included). The majority from the good mini trends of JPY pairs over the last quarter.   
  
For the current month, April, my current realized return is about 35% all thanks to the massive moves of the JPY because of BOJ announcement of QE.  
  
My current Open trades -   
  
Long GBP/USD @ 1.52784. Current stop 1.54150. +136.6 secured  
  
Short USD/CAD @ 1.01907. Current stop 1.01867. +4.0 secured

Ok,  
  
Let us talk about exits. Apart from the nerve from the pulling the trigger on the live account, exits are the most difficult aspect of trading. In this method, people have mentioned that on more than a few occasions, I end up giving back a lot of pips for only a few. That is true. But anyone can say that when looking in hind site. When you trade live, you have no idea what is going to happen. What the market looks like in hind sight is not what it look likes live. I trade this the way that works for me and my lifestyle and still yields not to bad results. The object is to ride trends, if no trend exists then capturing a few pips in return for the opportunity to catch a trend is not a bad trade off. For me it is low maintenance and low stress.   
  
Onward.   
  
Exiting my trades is the most important part to me. It is also the part that creates the most doubt. The object of trading, despite what all that online hype claims, is to protect your capital while turning consistent profits. A pip gained is ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS better than a pip lost. If anyone tells you different... Run... FAST.   
  
However, when I see a trade up 150 pips and I secure 15 pips, I hate it when a few candles later I am taken out with 15 pips. But, I hate it more when I close a trade early then it moves a huge amount. FX trading is basically what I call S.W.A.G. (Scientific Wild Ass Guess). It is not so much gambling as some may lead you to believe. It is, however, known as speculation which is a fancy word for educated guessing.  
  
So what do I do with exits. When price moves and taps my current SL, the market exits my trade for me. However there are situations where I close the trade myself.   
  
One example is when price crosses and closes above/below the supertrend. Price is just not moving in the direction I want. I would rather get out and wait for a better signal.   
  
Another example is if supertrend changes color. Again, trend is not moving in my direction. It is also telling me that a counter trend is developing.  
  
Other than these 2, most times PA is what takes me out.

Hi Ilz, thank u for sharing your method. I am trying to organize a similar one on stocks, therefore I am very interested. I only have Supertrend and Emas, not Barry's S/R, so I normally keep an eye on basic S/Rs, like candles highs and lows and main S/R appearing on the chart.  
  
Pls allow me to ask a question on your money management, as I have not understood what you do.  
  
You use 100 pips as initial stop loss (ok), and when you have 30 pips in your favour you move to BE (ok), and then 1 pip up above this "winning" trailing stop every 10 more pips gained (ok)  
I have not understood though what you do in between, that is: how do you move/manage your initial 100 pips stop, if the market does not give you the 30 pips. I see you do not always have 100 pips loss, so how do you avoid that?   
  
thanks  
G

I like the attitude and the concept.   
  
BUT: how can we avoid getting stuck into a non trending period? I have the feeling that ckecking S and R is not enough. You can go over a resistance and then slump back into congestion.  
  
See for example attached immage: I use Supertrend and the 89EMA (= the green line), the two tell me - combined - which way to trade. But with this stock I'd have caught many bad trades in a row, and only in March 2012 I could have said "that stock was definitely not trending" and "we are now out of the congestion"!

Hey gaia68,  
  
Lets we if I can help sort it out for you. Here is a hypothetical trade:  
  
Long GBP/USD  
  
Initial SL 100 pips  
  
Next candle I am DOWN 50 pips.  
  
Verify these questions:  
  
Did last candle close above 200 SMA?  
  
If YES **__Move to next question__**.  
  
If NO CLOSE TRADE  
  
Did last candle close above Supertrend?  
  
If Yes, **__Move to next question.__**  
  
If NO CLOSE TRADE  
  
Is super trend still BLUE?  
  
If YES keep trade **__alive__**.  
  
If NO CLOSE TRADE.  
  
Hope that helped. If you need more explanation, let me know.  
  
Now I want to be sure you understand.  
  
You stated : **_"and when you have 30 pips in your favor you move to BE (OK)"_**  
  
**__Once price moves to 30 pips in my favor, even if price has come back, I will place a BE +3 (If possible).__**  
  
You stated :**_"and then 1 pip up above this "winning" trailing stop every 10 more pips gained (OK)"_**  
  
**__For every 10 pips of movement, even if price has retraced, I manually add 1 pip to my BE. I am looking to , at minimum, secure 10% of the overall move. I am talking about candle highs/lows not current pip amount.  
__**  
Example:  
  
**_long GBP/USD @ 1.5000  
  
Next candle close @ 1.5050, Candle High 1.5100. My BE will be +10 NOT +5_**

Hey ashtrader,  
  
Money management was actually harder to come up with then the method itself. Its a fine balance of trying to keep capital secure while at the same time giving the trade a chance to develop. In all honesty, with a solid MM plan, you can make money by just flipping a coin.   
  
All I can say is from experience, you have to design your own money management. It has to be something you can live with. The goal of FX trading is to make money yes, but if you do not have any money to trade, your out of luck. FX is a business, not a game. It is not a get rich quick. With a good trading method and solid money management, FX is a get rich eventually plan.

> I like the attitude and the concept. BUT: how can we avoid getting stuck into a non trending period? I have the feeling that ckecking S and R is not enough. You can go over a resistance and then slump back into congestion. See for example attached immage: I use Supertrend and the 89EMA (= the green line), the two tell me - combined - which way to trade. But with this stock I'd have caught many bad trades in a row, and only in March 2012 I could have said "that stock was definitely not trending" and "we are now out of the congestion"! {image}...

Hey gaia68,  
  
When the market is in "TRAFFIC' I try to not avoid trading. "But when will we know when price will move?"  
  
Well, we don't. What I do is continue trading the way I do. You see, price is going to bounce between relatively tight S&R. When price breaks S&R, I take my trade, as long as other things line up. I might make a few pips, lose a few pips, but I do not want to miss out when price finally moves. And it will. It always does.

Hey IWAN37,  
  
In your first pick, the line you placed would be the entry candle. You would enter at the start of that candle.  
  
In the second pic, this could be a retracement or it could be a continuation. I do not trade that pair (CHF/JPY) but if I did, I would wait for price to close above a blue supertrend.  
  
In the third pic, price has been fighting with the 200 SMA line. It has also been congested around 103.00 mark. Also notice supertrend has not changed. Once it does turn blue and closes above supertrend, I will take the long. That is as long as resistance is broken.

Hey gaia68,  
  
There is nothing wrong with that. I used to use them all the time, but I do not rely on them for trading anymore. These days, I can just eye lower lows and higher highs. I spent enough screen time that trend lines are burned into my retinas!!!

**_TRADING GOLD_**  
  
I am going to chat a little about trading gold. Trading Gold is a bit different if you live in the Good Ol' U S of A. I get 0 leverage in trading Gold with my broker ([Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile")) but it's OK.   
  
Trading gold in the USA, My leverage is 1:1. That means I get 0.01 per pip. My margin is current market price.   
  
So why bother? Because its good practice... Cheap. Also, sometimes I hit a pretty good run. Like this month I hit a short on gold that netted me 16069 pips. That is not a misprint. 16069. Granted that equals $160.69 ( 16069 X 0.01 = 160.69 ) that kind of movement is not rare for Gold but I have mostly hit between 3000 & 6000 pip moves.   
  
My risk is always 5000 pips. I trade it the same way. However, after price moves 500 pips in my direction, I move my BE to 50. From that point I only move stops to new S&R levels.

At the start/open of marked candle? How did you know at open of candle No2 that it would be entry candle if Super Trend was blue at close of candle No1?  
As you described in post number 2 Super Trend must be red to enter short. This indicator was red for sure when candle No2 closed so as i understand entry rules we can enter short at open of candle No3.

Hey iwan73,  
  
My mistake, I thought that candle 1 closed red. Sometimes when supertrend changes color, it will do so with a small red/blue/yellow tip. I thought maybe that a small red tip appeared. If it did not, but was red at candle 2, then go for it.   
  
By the way, a yellow supertrend is just a warming. Do not trade or close a trade based on a yellow supertrend.

Hey All,  
  
So just FYI, My Oanda H4 Candles are as follows:  
  
1 AM PST  
  
5 AM "  
  
9 AM "  
  
1 PM "  
  
5 PM "  
  
9 PM "  
  
I catch all but the 9 AM. Gotta Sleep. But usually you can tell if something is going to happen. Sometimes if it looks close, I will get up @ 8:45 AM to check real quick and go back to sleep. Everyone's broker is different. Everyone will have different closing times for candles and different entry points.

Can you show me your entry on screenshot? I trade on different broker so our H4 candles are different.

Hi Ilzalama,  
  
I now understand your entry when price breaks 200sma and supertrend is confirming the price action etc but once the trend is established , from the way you move your stops ,I am sure you frequently get stopped out after 30 to 60 pips like you mentioned in your earlier post. After that stop out you will see price moving in your direction again , but now the 200sma is quite far away , if you could maybe point a few candles in those sort of situations on a chart , it would be very helpfull  
  
Thanks again

Continuation from post number 36 i.e the example below copied from pg1 of your post ,you got stopped out ,did you then reengage the trend as soon as price closed above the supertrend blue line

Hi Iwan73.  
Let's wait for ILZ to confirm, but I tend to think that the MA inclination may not matter. This is beacuse in post number one ILZ writes: " In this method I use the 200 SMA to show the over all trend in the current TF. When price is below the line, I look for only shorts. It helps if the line is also trending down but it is not necessary."

Thank you sir for all your explanation. This final part has particolarly enlightened my understanding of this part of your trailing stop management.  
  
I'd like also to ask: do I understand well that, when the trend evolves, you also move you stops a bigger step up, that is streight above a new S&R? For example I read in post number one  
"If/when price moves 30 pips in my direction, I move my sl to + 3. For every 10 pips price moves for me, I add 1 pip to BE. Once a new support/resistance line is confirmed (usually within 3 candles), I move my SL to that line + 3".   
By "that line +3" you mean a new "S&R line +3"? Could you show us an example?

Hi gaia68  
  
Look at my post no 37, you will notice on the chart of Ilz, that he only moves his stop if the s&r line has formed out of 3 candles , and he moves it 3 pips above(i think) thats why he got stopped out this time and not earlier on ,  
  
I just need a better understanding of how to re-enter after we get stopped out and the trend carries on in our favour

Hi Ashtrader, yes, you are right.  
I do not have Barry S&R in my platform, unfortunately, so on this chart you mention I would have thought that stop exit would have been in the middle of the chart already, because a recent support had been broken, but evidently that's not the case (bad for me), as the action continued and ILZ was stopped out later on (good for him).  
For whar concerns reentry I think that you have to wait for the canlde to close above the blue supertrend line, but also it is better if it closes above a "BARRY resitance" too. I do not know if this is a rule or if it is a less strict enhancement for better odds, but ILZ is stressing this concept in post 11, scenarios 2 - 3 and 4

Hi Gaia68,  
  
Its amazing how we are helping each other, thanks so much ,for pointing this out to me. I think this system sure looks good! Its time to test it. I was playing with small money(swing trading) so I never use to move stops ,but the minute we increase bet size everything changes , I might try ILZ's money management.  
  
Anyways thanks for pointing post number 11 to me. I read it but obviously missed something

Hey ashtrader,  
  
I did touch on this and am planning an advanced entry post. I will speak about now.  
  
Price has been above/below the 200 SMA I took a trade but now I'm out, how do I get back in?   
  
If price is bouncing around between S/R, I wait for it to break and close above/below the current established S/R  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1184674?d=1367368779)

  
  
What if price is above SMA but below the Supertrend & Supertrend is Blue or vice versa?  
  
In this situation, I would wait until price closed above a blue supertrend before I take the trade.   
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1184676?d=1367368928)

  
  
Some advanced entry would include the following:  
  
If price closes above/below supertrend in agreement with SMA and there is no established S&R, I take the trade.   
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1184676?d=1367368928)

  
SAME PIC AS ABOVE BUT SERVES THE PURPOSE  
  
Now what if there is an established S&R. For me, there must be at least a 30 pip space between the HIGH/LOW of the candle that closes above/below supertrend & the established S&R. Why? 30 PIPS is MY magic number. That is when I can secure +3 and now have 0 risk on trade.  
  
For example look at this pic:  
  
Here I would definitely wait till price breaks and closes. At no point were any of the candle highs 30 PIPS or more away from resistance.

Now in this pic:  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/1184674?d=1367368779)

  
  
I would take the trade because it has room to run.  
  
For those of you who need help with gauging it or not, might I suggest you head to [POST # 8](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=6641315#post6641315) & DL the ATR pips. FULL DISCLOSURE, I do not use that myself in this method. However, one could use it as tool to help gauge entry.

Hey gaia68,  
  
Once a new S&R is established, my stop is moved to that new line. In a long, I will subtract 3 pips from the line. In a short I will add 3 pips.

Hi ILZ's  
  
I am just wondering why you havent taken a trade on the euro , but you did take USDCHF ,kind of the same trade , did you see too much congestion on the euro , or is it because too much major news is coming out on the euro

Hey Ashtrader,  
  
Honestly, I have been getting chewed up on the EUR for the last 3 weeks. I lost -59 pips over that 3 week period end on 4/26. The 200 SMA was flat as a noodle.   
All that congestion is just ticking me off. I should have taken the trade on 4/29 long, but decided not to. It cost me 15 pip because that move has a high point of 150+ from were I would have entered.   
  
I still make mistakes. There is no technical reason why I did not trade it. It was a pure emotional mistake.   
  
It happens.

Hey Syracuse,  
  
I do not trade AUD/JPY, I just have not added yet. As my account grows I will add more pairs after crunching data on them, but having said that, if I was trading it, I would be short yes. It actually looks pretty good.   
  
Right now price is hitting a support point around 99.75. It is the same support line that was hit on 4/5. If it breaks and closes it should be OK till around 98.65 which is the last support line I see which was hit on 4/15.  
  
Remember everyone, Forex fundamentals are still required in any trading method. Those S&Rs are very helpful. They should not stop you from taking a trade but take notice of them so you have a heads up of previous S&Rs.

Hey ash,  
  
Unless you are trading [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") MT4, you will need to upload a screen shot for me to check out what you did.   
  
If you shorted AUD/USD @ 1.0298 I would have +6 pips secured. Thats just me.  
  
For your Gold trade Short @ 1452, where did you get in exactly?

Hey Syracuse,  
  
if you notice on that AUD/JPY trade you mentioned, price broke 99.75 and dropped a good 50 pips. That trade would now be a +7 for me. Thats why I like to wait for S&R breaks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi ILZ  
you stated: "Once price moves to 30 pips in my favor, even if price has come back, I will place a BE +3 (If possible). "  
  
in the image of post 57, how would your money management have been, after entry? Would you not have been stopped out by this BE+3 rule?  
  
Sorry if I am insisting and I am slow to understand, but I am a stubborn lady and I have no rest until I get the picture clearly!

Hey gaia68,  
  
LOL... It's no problem. That is why we are all here.   
  
In this particular shot we are discussing the EUR/USD. As you know I did not take that trade because I chickened out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

This is what would have happened had I taken that trade.  
  
Long @ 1.30920 Initial SL 1.29920  
  
The arrow is pointing at a candle with high of 1.3120 which was only 28 pips. The next tag shows were 30 pips was reached. But after that candle, which had a high of 1.31853 which is over 90 pips. So at the close of that candle I would have had a +9 secured.   
  
Hope that helps.

Thank you ILZ. Sorry, I do not trade currencies and I could not check better: from the first picture I had thought that 30 pips had been reached in the candle where the arrow is, and the trade stopped at the next candle. Thank you for the detailed explanation.

Hey ash,  
  
So according to your supertrend, you should **__HAVE NOT TAKEN THAT TRADE__**. Supertrend was **__NOT RED__**.  
  
Remember. For a **_SHORT_** ,   
  
1- price needs to** __CLOSE UNDER 200 SMA__**  
  
2- Supertrend **__NEEDS TO BE RED__**  
  
3- Price needs to** __CLOSE UNDER RED SUPERTREND__**

I would have opened the trade at the start of the new candle, not during the current. But you have the right idea!

Hi Ilzalama ,   
  
Thanks for pointing out , I thought price only has to close below the supertrend .   
  
So for shorts it must close below 200sma and price must close below supertrend and supertrend must be RED   
  
for longs price must be above 200sma and price must close above supertrend and supertrend must be BLUE  
  
ONE MORE ? if long does supertrend have to be above the 200sma or it doesnt matter   
  
& if going short does supertrend have to be below the 200sma or it doesnt matter  
  
Hey Bomi , yeah according to me 4hr candle must close, but as Ilzalama said you got the right idea .  
  
I really appreciate it Ilzalama THANK YOU AGAIN

Hi Ilzalama,  
  
Thanks for the reply. Seeing your trades I feel that besides your all regular conditions, you also considering 200 MA curve, distance between R & S lines and colour of MACD,STR & EMA. Am I right?

I still dont understand how you make use of your signal bar v3 indicator , have you noticed if you create a profile of several pairs and have signal bar indicator on all the pair templates it freezes mt4

Hey Bomi,  
  
I do not really consider the curve or angle of the 200 SMA. Of course it helps if it is pointing in the direction I am trading in, but as I stated in Post 1 " **_The 200 SMA is the most widely used and accepted Moving Average across all markets. It is especially useful in long term trading. In this method I use the 200 SMA to show the over all trend in the current TF. When price is below the line, I look for only shorts._It helps if the line is also trending down but it is not necessary. If you take a short trade because price closes under, I mean the price, not just if it spikes through, and the 200 SMA is either long or flat, the risk of the trade is higher that it will fail. That does not mean do not trade, it just means the likely hood of failure is_ _high__** "  
  
The distance between S&R does come into play. As I stated in post 45,**_" Now what if there is an established S &R. For me, there must be at least a 30 pip space between the HIGH/LOW of the candle that closes above/below supertrend & the established S&R. Why? 30 PIPS is MY magic number. That is when I can secure +3 and now have 0 risk on trade."_**  
  
As for MACD,STR & EMA, if you are referring to the Signals Daily Indi, I do not consider the information on that indi for trade execution. I use it for a visual guide for current price and spread. No other reason.

Hey ash,  
  
I do not actually use it for any trading decision. As I stated in Post 1,**_" I will include a extra tool called Signal bars Daily. It is not an indicator._You will not base trades off it_. It is a MTF tool that shows you the over all strength of each TF for the pair it is on. It also has the daily open, high low pip count and current spread."_**  
  
If you are having slow down issues, feel free to remove it. It is just a visual aid that makes me feel comfortable. It was one of the first indis I ever used and just feel comfortable having it on my chart. It is not part of the method ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hey all,  
  
So not a bad week. I did miss that EUR/USD but as it turns out the bottom fell out & I would have ended with +15 which equals 1/3 of a % return not realized. Not a huge deal.   
  
I did not take a new USD/JPY trade because I did not want to open a trade 30 min before NFP. Better safe than sorry.  
  
GBP/USD was less than 30 pips away from next resistance so that was a no go for me.   
  
For the week I realized **_438.3 pips_** which equals **_8.766%_** return. Not to bad.  
  
I currently have **_37 pips or .74 %_** secure for next week.  
  
Have a good weekend everyone.

Hey iwan73,  
  
The candle you point at closed for me @ 05:00 PST which was 30 minutes before NFP so I did not take that trade. Had it been an other time I would have. The candle I pointed at is my current USD/JPY entry candle.

It is true, but a trend is a trend. You may get in a little earlier or a little later than I will, but if it is a true trend, we all win.

Hi ilzalama,  
  
I like your system because you explained it clearly and it's easy to understand visually. I also like the simplicty of your MM and how you handle SLs.  
  
Have you tried this on the daily charts?  
  
What parameters would you suggest modifying if this method is used on the daily? (e.g. Do I still use the 200 MA? Do I still BE+3 after 30 pips? etc.)  
  
Thanks in advance.

hey dwvelarde,  
  
Well that quoting thing didnt work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
  
Anyway,  
  
Thanks. It is what works for me and my lifestyle.   
  
Yes, I did some back & forward testing on the daily. The results, if I remember correctly, were not to bad. However, that TF is just to slow for me.  
  
I can not suggest anything to you as it is not my money that you are using. I can however tell you what I did. The only difference was I used a 200 pip SL on the daily vs a 100 on H4. Even the +3 after 30 rule stayed the same.

hey jako2,  
  
I am not sure I really understand your question. However, no matter were S&R is, if price moves +30 in my favor, I move to BE +3. if I get taken out I just wait for another signal.

Hi ILZ  
Question: did u ever consider in your money management method, the idea of taking a part of the profit (example sell half position) when you are at a certain gain? That's what I normally do, and I let the rest go until the trailing stop takes me.   
it is true that it's a pity to sell if the gain continues streight, but as we do not know what may happen and it may retrace (it normally does after a peak), I like to secure part of the gain. Do you think it's better to keep the whole position? Did you try the other method too?

Hey gaia68,  
  
Actually, I never tried that. I don't know why I never tried that. I am going to go back and run some numbers. It might take a while but I will post the results here when I do.  
  
Thanks gaia68!

Hey ash,  
  
Since there was an already establish S&R and if price reached that S&R it would have crossed the supertrend ( which would trigger a manual close anyway ) I placed my stop at the S&R line with 3 added.

Hi Ilzalama,  
  
If you don't mind me asking, can you please explain how you have secured 23 pips on your AUD/USD short trade. I'm am asking this because at the time i'm writing this, the lowest low the pair has made is at 1.01646 and that is roughly 116 pips from your entry point. So shouldn't you have secured only 11 to 12 pips?  
  
Thanks in advance.

> I like the attitude and the concept. BUT: how can we avoid getting stuck into a non trending period? I have the feeling that ckecking S and R is not enough. You can go over a resistance and then slump back into congestion. See for example attached immage: I use Supertrend and the 89EMA (= the green line), the two tell me - combined - which way to trade. But with this stock I'd have caught many bad trades in a row, and only in March 2012 I could have said "that stock was definitely not trending" and "we are now out of the congestion"! {image}...

Can't really see which currency on that chart?  
  
2 suggestions:  
  
1\. Use the longer SMA as recommended by thread starter, to gauge better the main trending  
  
2\. Take only 1 lose trade in each direction; then place a line at the very high & low of that range, wait for the breakout  
  
Hope that helps

You are right, but as you can see from the pic I provided, I have a S&R line that is @ 1.02540. Following the method rules, I move my stop to the next established S&R line. Since this trade is a short, I place my stop 3 pips above the line making it 1.02573 ( I added the .3 pips to make it a round number, dont ask me why I do it sometimes and not every time, im just cooky like that ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)). So when you do the math you get:  
  
Entry 1.02803 - current stop 1.02573 = +23.0

Thank you for that prompt reply and for bringing to my attention that after achieving BE+3 you move your stop to above a new established S&R line. Somehow i missed that particularity when i read the trading rules.  
  
Thanks again for your help.  
All the best.

The current candle should close in about an hour. I think a long is setting up.  
If this picture represented the close of the current candle would you go long or wait for the break of the resistence line at 99.437?   
  
Thanks in advance. 

Stay on the PIPest side of life!

Hi ILZ  
  
on usdjpy chart posted by piper , the barry indicator has drawn resistance at 99.430 approx, would that stop you from taking the long, would you like price to break that resistance or the 4hour price action to close above that resistance

Hi Erebus,  
that is actually a daily stock chart, I much more often trade stocks, with daily candles.  
  
To understand your suggestion  
1) do you mean I shoud use 200 SMA instead of 89EMA?   
I honestly take a look at them, especially the 89EMA, but not always trade according to them. Especially 200 SMA seems sometimes to be almost irrelevant to the lower trends/inner waves we trade, so that I practically use it only as a margional information.  
Speaking about 200 days SMA and all the theories of long term investing using it, I wish I could trade well long term, but drawdowns do scare me on longer timeframes. I have not found how to invest long terms on stocks in a way that suits me and is profitable. But this is a diversion from our main subject here.  
  
2) this is a good suggestion, thank you. It is what I try to do in practice when trading, but it's a help to see it written.

Hey PIPer,  
  
If the distance of the close is AT LEAST 30 PIPS away from the current S&R***** , then I would take the trade.

Hi ILZ,  
  
What method do you use to back test, you have very clearly stated you do not believe in EA's , so how do you do it. like trying to back test partial profits ,etc.  
  
Lastly I know when you enter a trade you use 100pip stop ,but if in between the 100 pip stop you clearly see the barry indicator having drawn a support/res line would you move the stop down , or in the case of gold i took the short again! and now price hasnt moved much but barry indicator has drawn a support at 1441 at a resistance at 1460 , in this case   
  
Would you close the trade ,or would you move the stop down or would you do nothing , my entry was 1450

Hi ILZ,  
  
Do you take notice of daily Ma's , eg the usd cad I waited to short it until it closed below 200sma daily since price was just too close to it, just like how I didnt go long cable once price got to close to the daily gpbusd 200sma   
  
Thanks for all the input.

I like this system. Ilz how do you do your reentry? Do you wait for a price pullback at a support/resistence level and then you make the entry if price bounce from this level? Please can you show in a picture?

Hi Ilz  
  
In post 45 you said there must be at least a 30 pip space between the High/Low of the candle that closes over the Supertrend and the established SR.  
  
In post 123 you refer to the 30 pip space being measured from the Close of the candle and not it's High/Low.  
  
I may be misunderstanding you, but could you please clarify this entry rule.  
  
Great thread by the way, just what I have been looking for.

Hi Ilz  
  
Would it be possible to show a chart of some of the trades that you provide details for in your TRADE UPDATE posts? That is, as the trade progresses with candles marked where the Entry, SL, Exit actions are made.  
  
My MT4 charts are different to yours (server time GMT +2) and this would greatly help in understanding how you apply your trade management rules.  
  
Could you also explain the reason for the manual exit for the USDCAD short trade shown in the TRADE UPDATE posts 97, 101 and 107?

Ilz,  
  
want to ask you about the re-entry. Last night EURUSD break out of the resistance and at the same time pass the super trend line -- long signal. Got to 30pip so i move my stop loss to +3 pip. Then the next candle come down and hit the stop loss.. the signal still looks like its going to go long.. how do i re-enter?

Hey ash,  
  
Back Testing - Back testing is just a way to see if you have a viable method. The results do not really mean much except that you get a good guesstimation of what results could have looked like. I used the **_LFH simulator_**. Some do not like it because of inaccuracy issues but that is based on all tick data. All my trades are based on open/close so tick data is not important. It took a long time but I felt it was a pretty good account of what would have happened.  
  
Stop Loss - If I open a trade and there is already a S&R line that is less that 100 pips away, that is my stop.   
  
Gold - I only touched on trading gold. Trading gold is a different beast. My risk is always 5000 pips. I trade it the same way. However, after price moves 500 pips in my direction, I move my BE to 50. From that point I only move stops to new S&R levels.   
  
What I did not speak about is advance entry. I would like price to be 1000 pips away from any S&R line.   
  
I do not pay 100% attention to gold, meaning sometimes I just do not take trades on it with every single single, but when I see a break/close in the direction of the trend, I do take it. Break/close trades seem to do very well with gold.

Hey ash,  
  
I normally do not pay a lot of attention to what is going on in the daily chart. Feel free to trade as you like though. I am going for mid term trends so it may be a retrace on Daily chart but for me it is a mid term trend VS a long term.

In post 123 you refer to the 30 pip space being measured from the Close of the candle and not it's High/Low. I may be misunderstanding you, but could you please clarify this entry rule. Great thread by the way, just what I have been looking for. Koglkama

Hey Koglkama,  
  
Thank you for pointing that out.   
  
**__RE-ENTRY IS BASED ON 30 PIPS AWAY FROM CANDLE CLOSE.__**  
  
I am unable to edit that post with the mistake on it. But thank you for pointing it out!

> Hi Ilz Would it be possible to show a chart of some of the trades that you provide details for in your TRADE UPDATE posts? That is, as the trade progresses with candles marked where the Entry, SL, Exit actions are made. My MT4 charts are different to yours (server time GMT +2) and this would greatly help in understanding how you apply your trade management rules. Could you also explain the reason for the manual exit for the USDCAD short trade shown in the TRADE UPDATE posts 97, 101 and 107? Koglkama

Hey Koglkama,  
  
I can do that. I will post images to trades when something happens.   
  
USD/CAD -   
  
That turned out to be a bad thing because now it is a winner. However, as per what is stated in [Post # 21](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=6645619#post6645619), if price closes above/below the supertrend in opposite direction of my trade, i close the trade & wait for re-entry.  
  
Here is what it looks like in currently:

As you can see there is no upside for me to keep this trade open. There was no S&R line above. I cut my lose before it turned worse. I have no idea what is going to happen, I only know what is happening. If others would have stayed in then bravo, but I plan my trade and trade my plan.

Hi Ilzalama,  
  
great and inspiring thread. Nice work.  
  
I have a few questions if you don't mind:  
  
1) In your results in post 14, what has been your max. drawdown % ?  
  
2) How often do you have loosing weeks/months?  
  
3) When you enter with less than 100 pip SL, do you adjust your lot size as well, so ie. 50 pip SL= twice the lot size as  
with a normal 100 pip SL? or in other words, 2% risk no matter what the pip SL is?  
  
Thanks in advance,  
  
BR

hey pipcruiser,  
  
First off, thanks for the compliment. It took me a long time to get here. I still think there is more I can do & I am always testing ways to fine tune, but I feel the core method is sound.  
  
1) In your results in post 14, what has been your max. drawdown % ? **__Over the last 25 months ( including April 2013 ) it was about 10%.__**  
  
2) How often do you have loosing weeks/months?****__I do not really count weeks as that is a small frame of time. Over the last 25 months I have had 3 loosing months. It was not that bad, they were 2-4% losses. I have had months that were barely profitable. Again this is over the last 25 months, who knows what will happen next. That is why money management** _IS SO IMPORTANT_**. I'm not sure if you read my MM strategy but that MM strategy is something I am comforable with. It allows me to compound earnings while protecting capital in a way that I am comfortable with.__****  
  
3) When you enter with less than 100 pip SL, do you adjust your lot size as well, so ie. 50 pip SL= twice the lot size as with a normal 100 pip SL? or in other words, 2% risk no matter what the pip SL is? **__No, I never increase or decrease pip value until the start of the new month. That is when I recalculate & use that amount as a basis for all trades for that month. Even if I have a stop of less then 100 pips at trade start, the risk & pip value is still based on the full 2%/100 pip calculation. __**

This one works pretty good.  
Apply to 1 chart on each pair you watch for the headlines that affect that pair.

Hey fxpro123,  
  
I do not like adding any unnecessary indis. To much information flowing back and forth can slow down MT4. That is actually a stand alone piece of software. I have attached it. You will need to register, it's free.

ILZ, this is just an example for better understanding....please see yellow arrow. Would you reenter short there or you would not because it is less then 30 pips to nearest R(second green R to the left)?   
  
Or just let me know your thoughts why no reentry?

Hey driven18,  
  
If that S&R line that was tapped by the previous candle _**WAS NOT THERE**_ , I would short. If it was there, I would not.

It was not there and you did not short...I wanted to also ask you ...at times you do not take entries that I see and those entries "should of" been taken.   
  
Of course, you may have "sixth sense" about this technique or maybe you already leveraged with other trades...can you please expand on this point...

Hey driven18,  
  
I am not sure which broker you are using, but I use [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") MT4 for charts but execute off Oanda FXTrade ( better MM control).   
  
There are a few reasons I may wait or not take a trade.  
  
1) Major news is coming out. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f630.png?v=15.1)  
  
2) A major S&R ( weekly high/low ) was not broken. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/231b.png?v=15.1)  
  
3) I slept through that candle. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)  
  
4) Mistake ( I am allowed those ) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)  
  
5) Just because. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Our charts will not match if you do not use Oanda. You will have different S&R points, different O/C/H/L points. You may get a signal when I dont, or vice versa.  
  
I would like everyone to understand that any system, method or what have you should always take a back seat to FX fundamentals.

Hey ash,  
  
I have been trading it for years now so it is something I trust and am comfortable with. That is something that happens after awhile. Just as with anything, you learn and get used it. I am not saying this method is perfect or it is for everyone, but I just wanted show others what I am doing to maybe help spark an idea. I was going to thank all the folks who helped me or that I was inspired by or got an idea from, but that list is long and honestly, if they did not want to help anyone, they would keep the knowledge to themselves.   
  
Take care ash,

Hey Ilzalama,  
  
You took a few trades after huge candles, namely EUR/JPY (170 pips), USD/CHF (99 pips) and GBP/JPY (190 pips). Doesn't that put you off? Aren't you affraid that after such a big candle most of the move might be over?  
  
And another thing, at the same time you also entered an USD/JPY trade... Since all those 4 pairs are highly correlated don't you fear that if you loose one trade you might loose them all? Do you adjust your lot size when something like this happens?  
  
Thanks and well done on all those green pips!

Because there is an established resistance line should the original stop be placed just above that line or should i keep the 100 pips stop loss?  
  
Thanks once again.

Hi, PIPer  
  
Be ware of the number 1.3000. It is a dangerous position just like a support position.  
Sellers and buyers will fight for positions near special number, for example 1.3000, 1.3100, 1.2900, etc.  
  
Your entry is right and above is just an advice.  
  
Best regards

Thanks for you comments Frsthr, I was aware of that. But this account is a demo one so i took the trade anyway.  
  
I don't know if Ilzalama takes round numbers into consideration when openning a position... Maybe he'll comment on this issue.

Hey PIPer,  
  
You took a few trades after huge candles, namely EUR/JPY (170 pips), USD/CHF (99 pips) and GBP/JPY (190 pips). Doesn't that put you off? __Short answer, No.__ Aren't you affraid that after such a big candle most of the move might be over? __There is something that took awhile for me to learn. It was one of the hardest things to control._FEAR_. This market, any market really, is traded by humans. Humans are fearful & greedy. If you can learn to control that, that is your market edge. You can not be fearful. If you don't trade because of this, or that, or because this might happen, you are going to miss out on a lot. trading in it self, is easy. It's actually to easy. It is controlling yourself that makes it hard. My method tells me when this happens, do this, if that happens do that. if I want to succeed I have to keep doing what has been working. If the trade goes against me, I close it and wait for the next one.__   
  
And another thing, at the same time you also entered an USD/JPY trade... Since all those 4 pairs are highly correlated don't you fear that if you loose one trade you might loose them all? __No, my risk is controlled. I go in knowing that if it turns against me, I will lose X amount. I am comfortable with that. If I was not, I shouldn't be doing it. Also, they may be correlated, but each pair is a different animal. Each one is tied to factors that are different as well as the same. Having said that, if I am going to short the Yen, why not short it against all pairs if my method agrees? Why would I limit my self to just USD/JPY? You see, in my eyes, is there is a trend, i can spread the risk around to different pairs.__ Do you adjust your lot size when something like this happens? __My lot size only changes on the 1st of the new month, no exceptions.__

Hey PIPer,  
  
I place a 100 pip SL, _UNLESS THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED S &R LINE_. If there is, that is my stop. I do not adjust my lots size based on SL. it is still based on the 2%/100 pip risk.

hey Piper,  
  
Those numbers I call fear numbers. They are just psychological levels that are arbitrarily placed. Round numbers are nice and neat. I do not like neat. I am a choas kinda person. They do not bug me, if there is going to a trend I want to be in. Who cares what other peoples fear is making them do. If I am in and price breaks those fear levels, more often than not, price pushes out as all those pre-existing limit, stop orders are triggered. if I wait til after words, i just missed out on all that.   
  
You can't be scared. if your risk is defined and you are comfortable, pull the trigger. There are only 2 results when you take a trade. You either win or lose. Simple as that.

Hey all,  
  
Another good week. Not as good as last week but I am still on target for the month.   
  
For the week I realized _**174.1**_ pips which equals _**3.482%**_ return.   
  
I currently have _**85**_ pips or _**1.7%**_ secure for next week.  
  
Have a good weekend everyone.

Hi, ilzalam:  
  
Thank for your great post! I have used a similar system for years and got quite saitfied result.   
  
One of the different thing is 200MA. As you said, you do not trust EA and me too. But I use EA to test the history data. It will opitimize the number in MA for different pair.  
  
You use TF 4h, be careful, because 4h candle is dfferent from broker to broker.

Thanks for sharing your strategy. I have a question re. how you use Support & Resistance Indicator as I find it a little bit confusing from your comments.  
  
In Post #1, you said " This indicator is used as future stoploss levels/profit secure levels. "  
  
In Post #2, you haven't mentioned about this indicator while explaining your entry method.  
  
In Post #11, in Scenario 1, you said " price broke and closed above an established resistance point " while explaining a perfect entry, and in Scenario 2 and 3 you said before you take a trade, price would need to close above/below both the supertrend and current established S/R.  
  
In Post #69, when you explained the rules for a short trade, you haven't mentioned Support & Resistance Indicator.  
  
In Post #90, when you were showing your USDJPY long entry, you haven't looked for 30 pips close above resistance line.  
  
In Post #137, you said " Re-entry is based on 30 pips away from candle Close "   
  
Considering all above comments of yours, can you please explain how you use 30 pips close above/below SR indicator? Are you using this rule for Re-entries into the trend only? Or do you look for min. 30 pips close above/below SR indicator for all entries?  
  
Thanks,  
Regards,  
Blackeagle

Hello ILZ,  
  
Thank you for your method and all information that you give!  
Can you tell us, if when 30 pips are reached when the candle is not yet closed, you move the stop loss or if you wait until the candle is enclosed? Also do you use a trailing stop (expert advisor), or is it that you always intervene manually?  
Thanks  
Best regards

Hey ILZ  
after being stopped, do you take a new trade when a new candle open after price broke and closed above (below) an established S/R, of course if the other criteria are good (color super trend and 200 SMA position)?  
Thank you

Hello, Ilzalama,  
  
First, thanx for sharing such great (and pretty simple) trading technique. Very good thread, I will surely be following it. Second, I don't know if anyone has asked you this question, but did you think about securing half of your position for each pair, say after 40 or 50 pips and then letting the rest run till the HL or LH is broken with the same stop loss moving method? Of course then you'll have to change some rules about your money management, because you will either be opening two positions instead of one or opening bigger lot size, in case you have the possibility to close your position partially.

Hi Ilz  
  
Was the reason for the manual close of the GBPUSD trade (Post 165) due to the price closing back over the 200SMA? On my chart the price has yet to close down over the 200SMA.

Hey Blackeagle,  
  
In Post #1, you said " This indicator is used as future stoploss levels/profit secure levels. "  
__Correct__  
  
In Post #2, you haven't mentioned about this indicator while explaining your entry method.  
Oversight on my part.  
  
In Post #11, in Scenario 1, you said " price broke and closed above an established resistance point " while explaining a perfect entry, and in Scenario 2 and 3 you said before you take a trade, price would need to close above/below both the supertrend and current established S/R.  
__Correct__  
  
In Post #69, when you explained the rules for a short trade, you haven't mentioned Support & Resistance Indicator.  
__I am not a professional writer. Sometimes when I try to explain things, I tend to assume that everyone knows what I am thinking. I could have explained better.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)__  
  
In Post #90, when you were showing your USDJPY long entry, you haven't looked for 30 pips close above resistance line.  
__Price does not need to close 30 pips above/below S &R, it just needs to close above S&R in an amount. The 30 pip rule is PA needs to close 30 pips or more away from any established S&R point.  
__  
In Post #137, you said " Re-entry is based on 30 pips away from candle Close "   
__Koglkama had brought to my attention that I had miss wrote. I was not allowed to edit the original post. However that post is correct. "Re-entry is based on 30 pips away from candle Close"__  
  
Considering all above comments of yours, can you please explain how you use 30 pips close above/below SR indicator? Are you using this rule for Re-entries into the trend only? Or do you look for min. 30 pips close above/below SR indicator for all entries?  
__The 30 pip rule is for any & every entry. Price must be 30 pips or more away from any established S&R in the direction of my trade. Price only needs to close above/below S&R in any amount. It does not need to be 30 pips. __  
  
If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.

> Hello ILZ, Thank you for your method and all information that you give! Can you tell us, if when 30 pips are reached when the candle is not yet closed, you move the stop loss or if you wait until the candle is enclosed? Also do you use a trailing stop (expert advisor), or is it that you always intervene manually? Thanks Best regards Vcary

> Ignored

Hey Vcary,  
  
Technically, I am supposed to wait & mostly I do. But sometimes, if it is late or if I have to leave, I will just +3 the trade as long as price is a good distance away. I know that does not sound very professional, but people can gauge it after awhile. If I had to place a number on it I would just say if it HAS moved 30 pips in your favor and is at least 10 pips away, go ahead and +3 the trade.  
  
No, i do not use an EA. everything I do is manual.

Hey Oyapoke,  
  
Yes. But also be wary or strong previous S&R points, such as weekly H/L. i would still take the trade if PA tests these points, but remember % of failure is higher.

> Hello, Ilzalama, First, thanx for sharing such great (and pretty simple) trading technique. Very good thread, I will surely be following it. Second, I don't know if anyone has asked you this question, but did you think about securing half of your position for each pair, say after 40 or 50 pips and then letting the rest run till the HL or LH is broken with the same stop loss moving method? Of course then you'll have to change some rules about your money management, because you will either be opening two positions instead of one or opening bigger...
> 
> Ignored

Hey hotgon,  
  
Gaia has asked me about that and I am in the process of checking it out. However, it will be a long awhile before I have enough data to actually make a decision. i am also working on several other MM strategies, but for now this is my way and it works for me.   
  
Money management is a personal choice. It needs to be something that one is comfortable with.  
  
I have received several PMs such as:  
  
Just go for 100 pip TP  
  
Close half position @ 50 pips  
  
Add to position each time a new S&R is broken  
  
and many more.   
  
I can not say if they are good or bad ideas. They are just not for me, at least not with out a lot of data to back up each one.   
  
Hope that helps,

There is no reistance line where the yellow arrow is on the pic...so there is no place to move the stop

**_EVERYONE PLEASE READ _**  
  
  
Hey Oyapoke,  
  
Yes, the S&R levels are used for new Stops/Profit protection. Sometimes, however, they do not show up for a long while which I personally do not mind if the market is just bouncing along. However, if my trades are in deep profit, I can adjust my stops with out waiting for the S&R to show up. You can see new levels of S&R even if you do not see the indi show up. It is a money management decision. If your ok with waiting for them great, if not adjust your trades as you wish.   
  
This thread was started for the method, not the money management. I discussed my money management to give people an idea of what & how I control the trades. I have showed this method to a few colleagues. Some of them liked my MM method, some did not. One of them uses PSARs, I believe his settings are Step 0.02, Maximum 0.2. I actually liked that one but just stuck with mine because it works. He is comfortable with that, I am comfortable with mine. My buddy uses automated Trailing Stops. Some one else moves his stops to every S&R green & red. If it brakes and closes, he moves his stop.   
  
You guys see what I am getting at? You must be disciplined but do not be so rigid that you lose money just because a line didn't show up on your chart. Come up with a MM method that works for you. Don't use mine if you do not believe in it. Make one that works for you, use some of the ones that my colleagues use. The bottom line is, we are here to make some money, lets go make it.  
  
I want read and see what you guys are doing, post some charts and let me know what you guys are trading and what MM method you are using.  
  
Another quick note about creating a MM scheme.   
  
Please go live. Even if it's just a few cents a pip. If you dont, you will find yourself in a world of trouble if you can not handle how your MM works with real money VS demo.  
  
Take care- ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hey Ash,  
  
PSAR's is Parabolic Stop and Reverse.   
  
My EUR/USD is not 30 pips away from current S&R. My GBP/USD has not closed below 200 SMA, other than the 1st one were I had to manually close for a loss of about 30 pips.

Hey games130,  
  
As I just explained above, sometimes S&R does not show up. When I am heavy in profit, I am not going to watch it all go away because a line did not show up. You can just see S&R sometimes with out MT4 printing for you.  
  
look here:

The green arrow shows and S&R point. MT4 did not print it. I let it go and continued to hold my SL.  
  
The red arrow shows another S&R point. Again, MT4 did not print. I let it go and continued to hold my SL.  
  
The yellow arrow is yet another S&R that MT4 did not yet print.   
  
Going on the side of caution, i move my stop to secure profit. It was a money management decision. I do not want to get a big retrace and lose all that just to wait for a S&R line to be printed.   
  
it was my decision to do so. You will find when you are trading with real money, you will have to make decisions like that. What is the downside? There isn't one.

Hi IlZ,  
  
Thanks for explaining PSAr, yes I agree MM is personal , but atleast your records clearly show for the last 24 months your MM has worked well.  
  
In the last 2 weeks you have done very well , you have followed your strategy , without any hesitation , thats amazing!   
  
Hopefully I get there!   
  
If you have any suggestions of re-wiring the brain from making it over analyse by all means shout them out to me

Hey Ash,  
  
LOL, you made me laugh. There is no real way to re-wire your brain my friend. You just have to become more confidant in what you are doing. If you trust your trading method, not just this one but anyone, and have a solid MM method that you have tested in a live market scenario and you trust that MM method, the stress comes way down. After that its either win, lose or draw based on what the market does. it is completely out of your hands. you did your best. the trade will either win, lose or you break even.  
  
The best piece of advice I can give anyone is, it is a cliche, plan your trade and trade your plan. After that it's anyone's guess as to what the market will do. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

hi ILz  
  
audusd entry was 1.0199 on 7 may 2013 , got stopped out on 9th may 2013 , then barry put a resistance line at 1.0253 , supertren was still red   
  
rentry at 1.022 on 9 may, entry after 1st red candle on 4hour  
  
nzdusd entry 0.8390 on 7 may 2013 got stop out , on 9th may put a stop order to sell at 0.084250 , then with my superb over analysis skills went down to 1hour charts and saw all this pin bars forming facing north , i thought the trade isnt going to work , but i left it trusting the 4hour time frame   
  
so both trades running nicely

Hi Ilz  
  
When you adjust your SL levels to BE + 3 then + 1 pip for every 10 pips of price movement, or SR + 3, do you add on the spread for short trades? My chart shows only bid prices, but I believe [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") can show charts with either bid or ask prices.

As of the ILZ last update, we have new entry(yellow arrow) on GBPUSD at 1.5289 with stop loss at the previous R(checkmarked) 1.5387....almost the same as 100 pips intital stop....let's see what happens...

Hi Driven18  
  
I also got into that GBPUSD trade. What I am not sure about though is where the SL should be.  
  
In post 134 Isalama said "Stop Loss - If I open a trade and there is already a S&R line that is less than 100 pips away, that is my stop".  
  
On this basis should the green S&R line at 1.53135 (my chart) be the SL?

Hey Ash,  
  
So you should be +8 on AUD, NZD should have about +30ish, GBP should have at least +7. You charts must be way different then mine but thats OK.  
  
Keep up the good work!

Hey Koglkama,  
  
I add the +3 to all sl movements, except for the initial 100 at trade start, because my [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are almost always 3 pips or less, sometimes GBP/JPY may be a little over 4 pips during non-London hours.   
  
Also, a few pips does not really matter much when your trading on a larger TF. IMHO.

As you know I did not take that trade because I chickened out ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1). {image} This is what would have happened had I taken that trade. Long @ 1.30920 Initial SL 1.29920 The arrow is pointing at a candle with high of 1.3120 which was only 28 pips. The next tag shows were 30 pips was reached. But after that candle, which had a high of 1.31853 which is over 90 pips. So at the close of that candle I would have had a +9 secured....

Hi,  
  
  
  
what I understood from your thread I think your entry strategy is candle close above support and resistance or super trendline and break out candle high to low distance should be more that 30 pips? am I correct?  
  
if that is true then above screenshot how you are 9 pips in profit.Because after that 90 pips candle closed(which is break out candle of support resistance) you are entering the trade?

Hi Bedayan, please accept my explanation. From what I read:  
\- 30 pips is not the size of a candle. It is the room, the "free space" ILZ wants to see to legitimate a reentry, between entry point and visible resistance.   
\- he waits for a candle to close to be sure if the signal and then he enters the trade, that is in the next candle.  
I suggest: take all the time you need to read again all the pages and you will understand, it's well explained!

Hi Ilz, I am sorry if I am disturbing the thread by going away from the main subject, which is your trading method. I was undecided wether to keep silent, or to send you a PM, but in the end I think it's better that everybody sees, when you spend your time to answer questions, so many can learn!  
  
I am very interested in this couple: Supertrend and PSAR, which I also tried to implement. I'd need a big help: may I ask you if you have, briefly, other suggestions about it?  
I suppose one enters the trade when Supertrend-PSAR give the same signal, and exits when they do not "agree".   
But I feel that using it so simply and plainly it is not good enough. The Psar - which I like beacuse it's also very direct, like Supertrend - apparently generates many "false" signals compared to SUPERTREND even when the market is trending. And SAR and SUPERTREND have similar problems when the market is not trending.

Hey gaia,  
  
No need to apologize. Please, how else will you learn?  
  
So my friend Patrick is the one who uses the PSAR method of Money Management. I asked him if he could write it out for me. This is a copy paste from Skype:  
  
__" ExPat: The basic philosophy of trading Ilz trend runner stays the same. He chooses to use support and resistance as a method for controlling and managing his trades. I see nothing wrong that. I choose to use the Parabolic Stop and Reverse. It is what I am comfortable with. I have been using them for years in my futures and commodities trading history.  
  
I better get to it. Ilz always says I talk to much. **( He does, but it's not always boring![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f643.png?v=15.1) -ILZ )**  
  
It is actually very simple. Price closes above/below ST, SMA 200 & PSAR is above/below, take the trade. I do use Ilz 30 pip +3 rule. I then use a 25% rule. I trail my stop by moving my stop to 25% of the new highs of each candle close. For example im up 50 pips after candle 1 closes, I move my stop BE+12.5. You get the idea. If at any point PSAR changes direction, I close the trade. If it closes across ST, I close. If it closes across sma 200 i close.   
  
Its almost the same as Ilz. Oh yea, also if anytime the PSAR is higher then my current stop, I move there.   
  
Now leave me alone....   
  
![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61c.png?v=15.1)"__  
  
Hope that helps you Gaia.

Is Patricks' initial stop given by the PSAR (or eventually by the Suptrend, if this is closer than the PSAR)?

ILZ...few questions  
  
1\. You re-entered EURUSD where the yellow arrow is, correct?   
2\. Why did you place Stop Loss at 1.3029 and not at previous R+3 1.3054(where checkmark is)?

Hey gaia,  
  
He uses the PSAR. Not a 100 like me. Where ever the PSAR is is his initial SL.

He driven,  
  
Technically, that line has passed. However, one could place the initial SL at that point. I just choose to go with my initial. I pre-programmed my [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") FXTrade to place a 100 pip stop. Then I move it as needed. This time I just left it.

ILZ, you have placed a Stop for this trade at the Green R/S Line(yellow arrow)  
  
But support for this trade is at the red line(see red arrow)...  
  
Do you count green line as a Support also and it is a nearest S/R point for you?

Hey driven,  
  
No, not exactly. The move has been going on for awhile. My belief is that at some point it will retrace. I am trying to secure as much as possible. it is known that sometimes previous S&R lines can reverse. Support becomes resistance and so forth. Again, this is a money management decision. I have several trades open that are not yet secure. To insure against a possible loss, I am securing more profit to offset any possible losses. Remember, this is business. Treat it as such.

So this stop was arbitrary or still within rules and at the green R/S line?  
  
Do you always consider green line in the down move as S/R for purpose of moving stops?

It is more aggressive. It is not arbitary in the least. Again, sometimes previous S&R lines can reverse. Support becomes resistance and vice versa. I don't always but sometimes. I may or may not. It depends. Like in this situation, as explained above, I have several trades open that are not yet secure. To insure against a possible loss, I am securing more profit to offset any possible losses. So I move my stop to an established support line that has been broken. FX is dynamic, not static. It is always changing.   
  
Here is an example,  
  
Lets say your in a trade, GBP/USD lets say, BOE makes an announcement, BAM market shoots 400 pips in your direction. What would you do?  
  
Close?  
  
Adjust?  
  
Nothing?  
  
Whats the right thing to do here?  
  
Are you going to wait for PA to retrace, which it might or might not, and wait for S&R line to appear?  
  
Going to close and take a huge win? But it might continue after a small retrace and go for another a few hundred or it might not. Yes you can get back in but you run the risk of reversal. Then you end up loosing a chunk of what you made.  
  
There is no right answer because you do not know what is going to happen. You only know whats happening now. Make a decision, and get an outcome.

Hi Ilz,  
  
First of all thanks for sharing your trading method and congrats for all your winning trades, I have a little confusion on TP (I have not read the whole thread sorry but read first page explaining method and rules) should it be a next S/R or you have another criteria for closing the trade, also I will be grateful if you explain a bit about re-entering the trade.  
  
Sorry if all these questions have been answered earlier, I am in a day job so could not get time to read the whole thread (although only 12 - 13 pages to read) but definitely will have a look on weekend.

Hello ILZ, Thanks for your valuable information. Can you tell sometimes if you come before the end of a candle? To make a trade or close an other. For example, last night I was hesitant to take long for USD-CAD. The candle had clearly broken the 200 SMA before closing.  
Thanks

ILZ, please excuse for my bad English (I'm french...)  
  
Sometimes, do you take a trade, or close a trade before the end of a period of H4, for example because of a strong movement or break of super trend or 200 SMA?  
  
Or so is what you always expect the end of a candle?  
  
Thanks

C'est OK. Mon français n'est pas très bon non plus. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
It happens sometimes but mostly to close trade if its going negitive. I do not do it to open a trade.

Let's see whether it is useful to make money![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Surely I will be change his rules.  
The robot was generally written to trading manually directly from the screen. Therefore, it has many other features that are unsuitable for the system.

ILZ...please see red arrows....first red is crossing Super, second red is closing below Super  
  
Rules state we need to get out at those points, as price crossing supertrend back...why did you held the position?

Hi Ilz  
  
Also referring to Driven 18's post 266.  
  
I looked at a re-entry to GBP/JPY when price closed 2.1 pips (my chart) above the red SR line and decided not to enter.  
  
Ilz, I would appreciate if you could give some clarification on how to handle these type of entry set ups.

hey driven,  
  
Not cross, but close. Just because it spikes through does not warrant a open or close of anything.

ILZ, see second red arrow in the post #265.  
  
1\. Did you exit a trade, because it closed below Super?   
  
2\. Did you entered a trade after the next long candle closed and on the open of the next candle?

Thanks Ilz  
  
What I was really trying to ask but didn't express it very well was:  
  
For an entry or re-entry where the price crosses and closes over the SR level do you allow a minimum clearance between the close price and the SR price level? The example I referred to (GBPJPY) had only a 2.1 pip clearance on my chart, which I felt was insufficient considering that the Super Trend had been flat for the last 12 candles.

What are we looking at exactly? Do you have a screenshot that you can post as to what you're looking at? I'm pretty sure that you're looking at the short, but I'm just curious.

These is nothing written in stone no. It is a decision made by the trader. Remember, FX fundamentals should always be taken into consideration when making the decision to open/exit a trade.

Hey Driven,  
  
That candle was the 5 am -9 am candle. I missed it because I do not get up early all the time. I try to but sometimes I don't. Since I missed that one, I had to wait.

Hi ILZ.  
One question. Why did you not buy order on USD CAD after the close of the previous order? My robot did it and as you can see ..... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi Kasia,  
  
I like your robot. I had to put a buy stop 1.0181 , because when i went to sleep , the last two candles were not printed.   
  
Kasia if you can make this robot , I would love to discuss pricing with you.

Hey kasia,  
  
I'm not sure why you took that trade. After looking at it, price closed .2 pips over the ST line. To me, I did not see it. All i saw was a spike. I am not a machine, like your robot. Just be careful. i would not rely on a machine to trade my money for me. Especially when the dollar amounts go up.  
  
Good Luck.

Hey all,  
  
I would like to say a few things. I have no issue with any of you making a FAEA or a SAEA. I am even willing to help you outside this forum. I can run tests and check them against my trading history, help you fine tune, all to help you if you believe you need such a tool to help you.   
  
But I will say this so everyone understands.  
  
**_If you have any requests for help or would like some specific information to create a FAEA or a SAEA, contact me with PM. Please keep this thread free of FAEA or a SAEA chatter. I will start a separate thread for any and all interested in developing a FAEA or a SAEA as long everything there is freely shared.  
  
No one has permission to make a FAEA or a SAEA in order to sell it or make any money from it other than trading on their own account. I know I can not stop anyone from doing that but....  
  
if I catch someone doing that.......... your not going to like it._**  
  
Be cool, be respectful & be honest.

Hi Ilz,  
  
I moved my stop on nzdusd. then I got stopped out, but also price closed above supertrend , after that barry printed a resistance line , then price printed one red candle which didnot close below supertrend .  
  
should i have taken my short at the break of this red candle , or according to you am i suppose to wait for a candle to close i.e the present candle.  
  
and was moving my stop the right action.  
  
also having taken usdcad i.e putting a buy stop , is that the correct action i am using , or am i being impatient

This is what I wanted to hear. Also, I think that we can not fully automate the system. And that's why I added a AUTOTRADER ON/OFF very clever switch ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi ILZ,  
  
You dont seem to be taking trades on the NZDUSD , any reason ,  
  
BTW i misssed one of your earlier post about why I didnt take the yen trades and the usdcad earlier, its simply because I just never use to trade these pairs , so I just didnt look at those charts , old habits are hard to die, but slowly starting to look at them

Hey Ash,  
  
I wait for candle close for entry. No exception. You never know what might happen at the last second.  
  
You are correct to move your stop there. Also, if you price hit around the same area after a few candles, you can use that as new S&R even if its not printed. You will notice most times, S&R shows up around there any way.

I hear you there Ash. habits are hard to break.   
  
NZD/USD is just not in my basket (yet). I plan to add more pairs as my equity grows.

No. I only use 100 pips if there is no S&R that is closer than that.

Its cool ash. Im not mad or anything. I just want to keep the 2 subjects seperate.   
  
For people who want to trade manual, we do that here.   
  
For those who need some automation help, the new thread im working on now.  
  
i am sure some of us will bounce around between both. Lets just keep chatter about EAs on the EA forum.   
  
Those EA threads get crazy....

Hi ILZ and everyone else   
  
Havent still pulled the trigger on nzdusd, I am waiting if it breaks the 4 hour candle i will get in , however if it pullback around the .8200 area then i will get in, right now my barry rsistance is at 0.8300 , so risk is too much.   
  
I would like ILZ to comment on my thinking , maybe my brain thinks its too clever lol

hey PIPer,  
  
Sure i can explain that.  
  
This trade has been going for a long time. Any candle now it can start to retrace. There has not been a major retrace in a while. Since it is a highly profitable trade, I am being more agreesive with my stop movment. It is not just a random move. I have moved my stop to a broken suppoert line. As you may know, S&R lines tend to reverse when they are broken.

Also, I have a few losing trades and a few that are not yet BE. So to offset some that, I am more aggressive, but still careful, with all my winning trades

this stop loss move is super agressive , on my charts you stop is below the supertrend line indicator , arent you just asking to get stopped out ,   
the big move has happened i.e big 4 hour candle ...now pullback , I guess you are really betting price shouldnt penetrate the support line which becomes resistance   
  
anyways lets hope we get a rotation , I also think ILZ is very comfortable from getting stopped out and getting back in , am I right ILZ?

I am not 100% certain I should post this because it is not textbook money management...  
  
I have come to learn that sometimes the market makes irrational moves against the trend that are inexplicable. Today in GBP$ was an example of an overall downtrend with a strong 100 pip move against the trend.   
  
I was shorting at what turned out to be the low of the day. Price moves say 50 pips against my position... I look at the 200 MA and determine that there is little to no chance of price going that high today and since price is so far away from it, the trend is still down. Since I still feel strongly we are in a downtrend - short twice my original size at this point. But - to be on the safe side, I also place a buy stop above the next resistance level at 4x's original size.   
  
Today price went thru resistance and now I am short 3 units and long 5 units. The trend is still down so the long entry will be scalped -- only looking for 20 pips to reduce my losses.   
  
So price keeps going up - the scalp is taken and profits booked, but I still have 3 units short and price moving away from me.   
  
What am I to do???   
  
Stay calm and determine what the next resistance level might be... Today I determined it to be 5315 and put a short on for 5x's my original size. To be prepared for a completely parabolic push up I also place a buy order for 10x's original size.   
  
Price hit the 5315 short but not the 5325 long. I now have an idea that the market has reached its high and its time to wait for some profit taking. It took a couple of hours but eventually price fell pretty hard and I closed out all trades with a tidy profit.  
  
A few things:  
  
1) You have to have conviction in the overall direction of the market to trade like this.  
2) No stops are used.  
3) You MUST have an account that allows hedging.  
4) You must stay glued to your screen and remain absolutely focused.  
5) I do NOT trade like this everyday - only when the market moves irrationally against me.  
  
Some of you may ask what this has to do with the thread topic - well I was trying the threads method when i got caught on the wrong side of that push up. If things would have gone smoothly I would not have employed such tactics. If the thread owner feels this post innapropriate, I will gladly delete it.  
  
Cheers!

Ilz already told us in the begining of this tread to use stop lost at 100 pip, and to use money management, so we only risk 2% in single trade.  
That to anticipate the condition like this, when the trend got reversal, and market seem to against us.

Yeah - I'm not really good at following rules. Plus as you start to figure this trading thing out you discover that no matter what method you use, you have to make it your own to really make it work. Personally, I will never take a 100 pip loss - my instincts won't allow it.

This thing was do for a retrace. I do not thing it will last to much longer. If it does I can always get back in,. Also with all the news coming out I wanted to protect as much as I could. Good thing because I had a small string of losers.  
  
its all good.

Any chatter about different Money Management methods is fine with me. just be sure any changes you make are viable and do not just react because you may be taking a few losses.

To be clear, I said this is **_WHAT I DO_**. You can do whatever you like. Risk more or less. Whatever you feel you can work with.   
  
My suggestions is 2% max per trade.

hey enochben,  
  
I think we are in same position.. greedy... and unwilling to take a loss. i think i have funded more then 6 accounts and busted them all in less then 2 months because i was greedy. i open big trades and pray for the big win - which dont happen.  
  
Now i am trying to follow Ilz rules because if u think about it... its better to earn 2-4% month rather then bust ur account and loose all ur money. with the 2-4% slowly after a few years... it will become alot .. so be patience and dont risk too much.  
  
EDIT: ooo ya... i guess sometimes you just need to keep busting your account before you realise you need proper money management..

the market does not trend for ever. Now is the time to put in some real work. this is a trend catching method. if its not trending, its taking small hits and small wins.

Hey all,  
  
I am getting messages at a steady pace about why its not working or what happens when the market is ranging. As for ranging markets, the market does not trend for ever. Since this is a trend catching method obviously it will not be as profitable when the market is ranging. As you must know, every system has a market nemesis. For this one its a ranging market. However that is when the Men are separated from the boys. Everyone is all happy and excited when the method they are using is working great. When they start losing or not getting pretty, nice trades, they jump ship and look for something else. I did that for my first few years, as I am sure many others have also.   
  
Just chill out, calm down, control your trades & watch your money management. Markets will trend again.

I completely agree , I have been round the block too! I think this is where money management is going to come into play .   
  
Hey ILz, if you dont mind , you have been using this system for a long time, and the last 2 weeks have been awesome because markets have trended so nicely. I think it will help the group , if you can explain in more detail how often you get runs like this . How often you are taking small wins/losses. So atleast everybody gets a reality check. Right now it feels trading is so easy , but when the going gets choppy, we dont want to be moving from one strategy to another, or one time frame to another.

That's a fair question. However, no matter what I answer, the future is unknown. It is easy to see the history however, just scroll back on your charts and you can see. It is easy to see entries & exits, easy to see where it was ranging. Seeing it yourself is better than I explain it with words.  
  
I will give it a try. I kind of explained it before, "This method, in general, takes many small wins ( protecting capital) fair amount of double digit wins, a few large wins ( amounts in excess off 200 pips) and a rare massive win ( anything over 400 pips).   
  
On the down side the losses are always kept to 100 pips ( 2%) but do not always get that far. There will be many small to average losses in the 30 to 60 pip range. Again this is over the last 24 months."  
  
The longest ranging period I can remember was about a month but not on every single pair. For the must part though, some pairs will range for a week or so, while others trend, then they will reverse. I can not remember a time when every single pair I was watching was just ranging for a long period.   
  
Hope that helps,

I am not new to trading... I am past the blown account stage, I have not blown an account in 3 years. When the market moves against me I always trade out. I have traded everything from cotton to cocoa to soy meal to treasury notes and once you put in enough screen time you start to see that all markets move in pretty predictable cycles. Every once in a while the market will move in an unpredictable manner - experience has taught me that it is best to be patient and wait until the market return to its cycles - in the cycle there are pushes up and pushes down - just like waves at the beach. These waves in different directions provide opportunities to scalp in both directions. I know everybody is not comfortable with scalping and thats ok. I'm just telling you what I do.

ILZ, if candle is < then 30 pips away, but(as an example) next or second next candle closed > then 30 from the the same R/S, do you enter a trade or wait for breakout of this R/S to see what next trade will do?

Hey all,  
  
Rough week. Majority of realized gains is from long held positions.   
  
For the week I realized **__374.8__** pips which equals **__7.496%__** return.   
  
I currently have **_27_** pips or **_0.54%_** secure for next week.  
  
Have a good weekend everyone.

Hello ILZ,  
  
Do you look at candles only every four hours: At the 1AMPST, 5AMPST, 9AMPST ... Or do you look [OANDA](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") more often??  
That seems to me important to know, on the psychological plan and that of the stress that it engenders.  
Because if we often look at the platform, we can tend to do stupid things.  
In particular: do not respect rules.  
Grace in your method, I was successful last week (thank you!), but I often stayed in front of the platform, what brought me to cut positions too early  
  
Thanks  
  
Best regards  
  
Oya

ILZ, I know some exits are, as an example for longs...  
  
PA crosses and **closes** above SuperTrend  
PA crosses and **closes** above 200 SMA  
  
but just to confirm, when **PA crosses R/S Stop** , you do not waitfor candle **to close** above R/S to get stop out?   
  
It is a straight cross, correct?

Hi All  
  
Ilz's rules will say price has to close below that support on a 4 hour chart , or you could be aggresive and take break of that support , but thats higher risk , or wait for 1 hour candle close  
  
but if you go by his system its for sure close of candle below support

Hi ILZ  
  
sometimes there is no support/resistance , but price has moved like fast and far(parabolic move) and we are hitting major support i.e monthly and weekly support do you hold or take profits . I have been holding my trades, but had some srious pullbacks back to resistance which was old support , most pullbacks on most pairs have been huge.  
  
Any advice , or just accept this as part of the system , I know too much optimization might get us into big problems

Hi ILZ,  
  
Now you can all see the deep pullbacks , and everything is on major support areas, do you have a plan , or you just let the market show you

ashtrader...you need to move your stops to the closest R/S...that is the whole point of the technique, to get you out based on PA and closest R/S

hi driven 18  
  
so you think yesterday i got lucky , and today where would you have moved stops to   
  
i think audusd 0.977  
gbpusd 1.5116 or 1.5156  
usdcad 1.03114  
eurusd (if anyone entered they would be stopped out ....this pair is seriously choppy for this method right now(just my thoughts)  
nzdusd 0.81140  
  
the above are stops i think are realistic, but i would love to know where you would have moved stops, and ofcourse all yen pairs we would be stopped out

The last trade should have been closed after candle closing above supertrend and new trade should be open after candle closes below supertrend, supertrend should be red and price should be below 200 SMA.  
  
ILZ may comment more on this.

Hello everybody!!  
  
I have a doubt since this topic started, Im just confussed and need somebody who can explain me (with a picture) **how the 30pip re-entry method works?**  
  
I have read many times: ''if prices closes the same color of the trade to be taken and is at least 30 pips away from (any?) S&R"  
  
Since Im spanish I dont understand it (sorry ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ), please could somebody explain it to me **with a picture** , I have 90% of the system learnt I just cannot understand how to make this work... Im just waiting for a candle close above/below the S or R line and only if this happens I enter a trade, but this ''30 pips system'' seems like a way to start trading the re-entrys before, am I correct?  
  
  
Thanks you all in advance  
  
Esteban

this system is awesome even i have been giving it a try and seeing lot of capacity to it , i have one question to all the masters , how do we filter bad trades and how do we avoid flat market, like bars can jump the trend line lot of times in direction of 20s , so it can be danger some time.  
  
if in case we can add a filter can avoid few wrong trades. H4 looks the best out of all the time frame... great share keep ti coming

as you all can see the circled area how to filter this trade   
like what is the best place to take the trade  
difficult to avoid this area as we will pull the trigger as soon as the bar closes below the trend line

Just make sure your entry is more than 30 pips away from the next sup/res as stated in the system rules and you will filter them.

GBP/CHF is looking like a long trade on the daily chart. The daily bar crossed up thru the blue line and the 200 SMA. If it closes above both I will go long.

Hi everybody,  
  
I am looking at this strategy as well, and have a question for the experts here. If you look at the trade I took on the AudUsd earlier you can see there is enough free room for the trade to develop, roughly 36 pips.  
  
As usual price went the wrong direction. but after a few candles it came back to the entry point. What should I do now ? Leave it open and wait until it goes through the support level again or consider this as a wrong trade and try to get out with a small loss/profit ?  
  
Thanks.

Hi MeAgain  
  
As I understand the rules the candle that crossed and closed back above the Super Trend line is the signal to exit the trade. Ilzalama explains this in post 15.  
  
On this candle it also looks as if price has closed above the red SR line. If it closed 3 pips above the SR line that is also an exit signal.  
  
I was also in this trade an exited on the SR+3 stop (my broker is not [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") so the prices are a little different to your chart). Price has now crossed and closed down over the Super Trend line signaling an entry. Unfortunately I was asleep and missed this one.

I am in that AUDUSD trade too. The thing is, yes the rules say " price closes otherside of ST, close the trade", you have to look at that downtrend to the left. Ilz has given us these sensible entries, now trade what you see a little to add some edge to your trading. All these entries are "with the trend" already but in some cases such as now with AUDUSD, the trend is pretty pronounced. Chances are that price was going to drop lower. Ilz keeps stressing the dynamic nature of this especially in exits. As mechanical as we want it to be it usually is never.

Hi Me again,  
  
I wouldnt close that aussie trade but according to his rules ,if price closes above supertrend you have to close!   
  
I look at the resistance on the left in the case of downtrend then decide , if the number of pips are not too much to lose leave it open

Hi all  
  
One thing I am seeing is the pullbacks can be fast and lethal and can make you give up many pips not sure how to play this, close trade then wait for pullbacks or just do what the rules are set out to be.  
  
in a nutshell does anyone have any different exit rules .   
  
nb ILZ if you do not want me to discuss diffrent exit rules ,please just let me know

Hi All,  
  
I'm new here and have been reading and learning about Trend Runner.  
Got a question, as described in picture (Short Entry).  
  
[Attachment ](https://www.forexfactory.com/attachment/file/1202904)  
  
Do we:  
1)Set SL at 100pips  
2)3 pips above the Green SR or Red SR  
3)Set SL right above SuperTrend in case candle closes above SuperTrend?

hello dear forum mates,  
  
don´t want to go off toppic but in the scenario above usd/jpy the trend is up, we got a retracement to a huge level of support near 100.750 do you consider a buy trade over this support level? or wait to a new level of resistance be drawn and enter long at the break out of a new resistance level.

Hi Vicentis  
  
At the moment you wouldn't be able to go long because the Super Trend is red. But if the Super Trend turned green and then price closed above it that would be a long entry set up.

hello ashtrader,  
yeah I had 3 trades open all going up nicely,total of 140 pips,started plummiting,so at 40 pips total closed the lot.If I hadnt I would have been stopped out with losses on 2 and 10 pip profit on 1.So maybe take the basket approach and get out with a profit.

Hi All,  
  
Been reading up past posts by members from here and another forum.  
Just another question for you experts out there.

  1. Based on guidelines for the trade to take place: IF THERE IS A ESTABLISHED S&R INFRONT OF YOUR TRADE, LONG OR SHORT, PRICE MUST CLOSE AT LEAST 30 PIPS AWAY FROM THAT ESTABLISHED S&R. (I think thats the case with the red lines?)
  2. But do we ever take those marked with yellow (Past S&R) into consideration or only the one directly in front of you?

as per my knowledge yes u should , as those are the S/R as well , the pair will react on those too... it all depends how u read the market i took the trade where u have shown the charts and exit in 20 as i knew it will react as the pressure is not too strong as of now ...  
two ways to trade those things wait for it to close below the Support and than take it or risk small amount and try your luck with it... i went with the second option got rewarded 20 pips......  
  
its all on you my friend

Hi  
  
audusd, my entry was earlier , the way price closed near super trend , i didnt close my trades, but now I got stopped out . The hardest part is exiting trades, if you exit with just a few pips i think it can be dangerous because your losing trades will also be few pips ,by few pips i mean apprx 50 pips.   
  
Maybe Ilz's rules are best!!

Hi, im fairly new to this also. But from reading the guidelines:  
  
IF THERE IS A ESTABLISHED S&R INFRONT OF YOUR TRADE, LONG OR SHORT, LESS THAT 30 PIPS AWAY, PRICE MUST BREAK AND CLOSE THAT ESTABLISHED S&R BY ANY AMOUNT.   
  
I think that last candle have to close above the R&S line in order for you to have a valid trade in a new candle.

Hey all, please correct me if im wrong and let me know your thoughts. Guess this is one of the other way I can learn as I move along.  
  
EUR/JPY (Long): Can either enter trade now with at least 30 pips to R&S or enter when candle closes above R&S.  
  
EUR/USD (Long): Candle must close above SMA 200 in order to jump into trade on the next candle.  
  
So far, I think the EUR/USD looks promising provided it closes above the SMA 200.

2 Positions ! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Long EURUSD - entry 1.3042- Comment: Stoploss is set at 100pips but will check how the trade progress, a close under SMA around(40pips down) then I will close.  
  
Long EURJPY - entry 131.832 - Comment: This beast got massive resistance above it, if it breaks up because of strong momentum, the shorts stoplosses will trigger. That can give energy to a big long move up. This is my speculation. Im still sceptical. Will have a close stoploss around 131.240. That should give it room to move.   
  
We will see how the trades progresses, so far im + profit overall with this system, still I have missed a good one on USDCAD. Been trading it live small account for 2 weeks.

Looks like both EUR/USD & EUR/JPY both have a S&R right in front to overcome and close above it before any further upward movement?  
  
That being said, if EUR/JPY doesn't close above the S&R we might be looking at a 'Double Top'?

Welcome back ILZ! We missed you... Congratulations to you and your brother and hope you had a nice vacations!   
  
You are a very lucky man! This week and previous one were not so good for trending trades! I think most trades finish in loss or be. Anyway the system is awesome and ranging periods are the most difficult part of it!   
  
Will be tuning this channel to read your thoughts!

This is how eurusd looked when I took the trade. No resistance was there, due to sleep I didn't check my charts either, only my positions on my smartphone. Closed it on -7pips loss, when I saw the new resistance.  
[http://forums.babypips.com/attachmen...8&d=1369975947](http://forums.babypips.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=46688&d=1369975947)  
  
This is how eurjpy looked when I took the trade. The new candle shows up in 43 seconds. Was taken out by my stoploss at 131.650. Placed a tight stoploss when looking at my phone, didn't like the big resistance(double tops). If I had looked at my computer this night I think I would have exit earlier manually due to see the real charts with my indicators.  
  
Looking at it even more, I bought in to a place of heavy ranging. Anyhow I had my speculation and knew the consequenses. <http://forums.babypips.com/images/smilies/yahoo/1.gif>

I will start to look into my own money management plan, think I will modifiy stoploss and target with Average Daily Range for every pair, maybe open to trades, let one flow as long as possible and the other one with a target. Based on ADR. Will get back if I work something out. Seen to many trades in good profit being materialized to only a few pips in profit. Also needs to say that it's saved when the big reversal has come.

Hi Ilz,  
  
Thanks for sharing your strategy, I have questions (please look at attached picture) where we should close the trade.  
  
Candle 1 = Our trigger candle - price finally broke support to go short on the next opening candle  
Candle 2 = Short open at the start of the candle, but it looks like false breakout. The candle finished with the price pulling back and close back inside support.  
Candle 3 = Price finally shot right through and close on the opposite side of SuperTrend line.  
  
My question should we close the trade on the candle 2 or should we stick to the rule and close the trade on candle 3?

Hi ashtrader,  
  
Thanks for the input, but if you look at the picture ( the period that I circled) the supertrend was red.

i think when price closed above or below the 200sma.at that moment, the first confirmed candle is more secure....

Hi Nano,  
  
I hope Ilza won't mind me commenting, I trade something similar to this, take a look at the 4h candle that turns the SuperTrend indicator RED it's 150+ pips in length also there is more support/demand just below.  
  
Ilza might not take the length of the candle into consideration but I'm always wary when there is a 100+ pip candle involved in any setup it's just something to be wary of.

Hi Steve,  
  
Regarding long candle I think you might like to read Ilz post #90.... Basically he said he did not care about long candle if condition is right he will take a trade regardless long candle or not.

I think we have a candidate for entry. USD/JPY, the 4H candle has closed below ST and 200 MA. It's a pity the candle is rather long, selling the price from 99.63 looks so "uncomfortable".  
Anyway, if the price pulls back a little bit to 99.85, I will sell with stops at 100.49. By the way I will be entering with two positions. One will be closed at 99.00

Hi ILZ and gang  
  
we need you here,  
  
what a week, guys if we had taken all the setups we would for sure be very green  
  
anyways i only took the audusd nzdusd ,and i took them late, because i thought markets are moving sideways, i also took euro long beginnig of week closed the trade with too much overhead resistance , and once price closed above res DIDNT TAKE THE TRADE  
  
I AM SO ANNOYED , no more messing around , i feel this system works well with all the pairs ILZ trades , you might have a few losing pairs but some others should be trending  
  
also missed usdjpy short.

This is not a support group for new users, I have seen people banned for less in most other system threads  
  
But that is up to OP  
  
You don't even mention if you are using MT4 ?  
  
You better learn the file structure  
  
You better learn a lot of things before using real money

I have been doing a lot of back testing ,   
  
i tried with an EA it made a samll loss,-approx 3% over 3 years, then i have done my backtesting the hard way using LHS eye balling ,  
  
I have made a profit every year , but trending years were great. Now I am doing comparisons off daily charts , also to see how much diffrence it will make.  
  
Also I havent got safe at 30 pips , but used technical levels   
  
Only done EUR USD Yet, long way to go

Hi Ash, I have not understood: what do you mean by " then i have done my backtesting the hard way using LHS eye balling"?  
I don not know what LHS eye balling is.  
Thank you

hi gaia,  
  
i mean move your charts all the way to 2008 , then keep on writing your trades on an excel sheet , then see , entry stop exit, just to let you know my max stop is 100 pips   
  
only done eurusd as yet, finished doing gbpusd for 2008 , the first 6 months of 2008, on gbp usd was extremely frustrating. Only when you do this ,you will realise ,how when markets get choppy ,it gets tough. but havent made a loss in any year.  
  
long way to go need to do all pairs. also if you skip the 30pip safety rule , i think risking 2% on EVERY SETUP might be dangerous, and if you follow the 30 pip rule trust me you are going to see so many break even stop out , that would have worked  
  
like ilz said no system is perfect

Name 1 - just 1 - indicator that is NOT described as lagging  
  
that is about the first thing I read in any blog about indicators  
  
they are lagging, blah, blah, blah  
  
but with 4 posts and being ichimoku KING  
  
I guess you knew that already

Hi Ash, I am also elaborating some similar strategies on my daily stocks....as we all agree, no system is perfect.  
BUT we need to aim to find a "good enough" one ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi again,  
  
It's MeAgain.  
  
@Ash: I was reading you were doing manual back testing.  
  
Do you realise the SuperTrend is a repainting indicator ? Once I am looking at the results of a simulation run and then put the indicators on top of it you see that when the indicator changes color, it's about one or two candles later. Concluding, it is unreliable.

for some time i thought about that the repaintig "super trend", now i´m trading something different but based on some of the same principles i have a "Supertrend" that doesn´t repaint:  
  
its a channel produced by ema(21) @ high and ema(21)@low when candle close above ema21high supertrend is green when candle close bellow ema21low supertrend is red. colour change when another signal is triggered.

Hi Erebus,  
I've been using emas for 7 years now, but I cannot go into 1H charts, have to stick to daily charts to take decisions.

Hi Vicentis.  
  
I mainly use MAs and EMAs as a reference, following JAMES16 Price action instruction:  
21 MA  
79 MA  
89 EMA: this I particularly like because many trending stocks often bouce on/off it (I trade stocks, daily)  
365 EMA  
  
and I add  
50 and 200 MAs, because most people use them.

Hello -ilzalama.  
  
With greater attention read the material given by you and comments.  
  
Thanks-ilzalama, that you have shared the knowledge, and your development.  
  
Good, interesting strategy Trend Runner. Has liked....  
  
Precise rules of trade..., rational selection of indicators.   
  
Your work is worthy also the further studying.  
My first attempt with your strategy EURUSD - positive. Though I was included into the transaction little bit later.  
  
Excuse me for bad English.  
  
  
At me questions:  
  
1) whether you carry out transactions on Friday, or prefer to wait for Monday?   
  
At me signals on opening of the transaction, however they were generated in the end of the American session on Friday? I do not know as to act?  
  
(there Can be "GAP" in the opposite party, or a change of moods of the market on Monday?)  
  
2) whether trading sessions influence your decision? Whether it is necessary to consider them?  
  
3) for all currency pairs stoploss has identical size (100pips)?? I.e. you do any amendment on spread, or on volatility pairs?  
  
I.e. GBRJPN (100 pips+6 pips spred)?   
  
4) why you do not use pair usdjpy?? The result was bad.....?   
  
  
  
Thanks,-robinzon
