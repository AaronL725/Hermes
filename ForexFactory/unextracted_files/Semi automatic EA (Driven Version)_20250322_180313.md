Hi guys,  
  
Just wanted to share my idea hoping for good feedbacks from all of you guys. So here’s my idea,   
  
I’m busy doing my job since I’m an employee, so I wanted to have a minimum control of my chart, I just want a daily control, secondly there is no EA that works forever since the market is changing overtime so I have to “drive” the EA manually ( set the EA “Long only” or “Short only”). So far it ganerates at least 500pips per month. It's very simple and easy, I’ll show you how.  
  
1. Put the EA on **5 Min chart**   
2. Put the template and indicator on your **daily chart**  
  
**How to start and “drive” the EA**  
1. See the major trend on daily chart just like the pic below,  
2. When you see the trend down on daily chart, “Drive” the EA “Short only” on your 5 min chart, and vice versa  
3. When you see the trend is changing on daily chart then you have to “drive” your EA on 5 min chart accordingly  
  
The goal for this setting is less stress because you don’t trade news and not sit in front of your computer for a long time, just check it once or twice a day.  
  
**How to drive the EA Long or Short only, please refer to word file I attached.**  
  
For example:   
Try to backtest GBPUSD for 1 month period from 1 August 2008 to 31 August 2008, becouse on that month the market shows downtrend from start to end, set the TP to 100pips, drive it short only and u will get approximately +3094pips in a month. FYI..price range for that month is only 1067pips.  
Backtest for EURUSD on Aug 2008, for short only, TP 100pips, u will get approximately +2135pips in a month, and price range is only 1029pips.  
Then u get a total of 5229pips in a month of Aug 2008 for those two pair.  
  
**This system works great depends on your skills to drive this EA.**  
  
Please see the discusion link below for better understanding about this setting.  
Start from post 2090 page 140 to post 2168 page 145

**__Technical question__**  
  
  
  
__**How do I adjust the EA for 4 digit or 5 digit broker platform?**__  
  
Try this setting:  
  
_**5 digit broker platform**_  
SL : 3000 (means 300 pips)  
TP : 500 (means 50 pips)  
Pipstep : 400 (means 40 pips)  
  
_**4 digit broker platform**_  
SL : 300 (means 300 pips)  
TP : 50 (means 50 pips)  
Pipstep : 40 (means 40 pips)  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
**__Why does the EA open many position?__**  
  
_pipstep setting_   
usually 20 open position at the same time is not normal, maybe u should check the setting for the pipstep.  
lets me show u this,the default setting for pipstep is 40 pips, then when u open buy position and then the market goes against u for -40pips, then the ea will open another buy position, it will do the same thing when it touch -80pips and so on. so check your pipstep and adjust it to your broker platform, the default is for 5 digit broker platform.   
so according to SL for 300 and pipstep is 40 then maximum open position at a time is 300 devide by 40 is 7 maximum open position at a time.  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
**__Why does my EA is not working?__**  
  
Perform this check  
  
1\. Have u set the EA to "Allow live trading"?  
2\. Activate the button "Expert Advisor" on the toolbar  
3\. Make sure there is a "smile icon" next to your EA on the right top of the chart  
4\. Adjust the setting according to your broker platform  
5\. Check the internet connection, since this EA needs a very good up time internet connection.  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
__**Can I change the setting for SL, TP and Pipstep? SL is too big for me**__  
  
Of course yes, as u feel comfort, the point is that I informed u about the major idea of "driving the EA". Just try your optimum setting fits your strategy.  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
__**How do I backtesting this EA?**__  
  
U have to drive the EA according to the major trend even its on backtest, just exactly when U foward test it. drive the EA each time u find a trend reversal in a spesific day.  
  
Like I mention before, try to backtest it for 1 month on Aug 2008, becouse that month the market shows down move from start to end, drive the EA short only and u will see that.  
  
  
  
_####################################################################_  
  
**__Non Technical question__**  
  
  
  
__**What did U do when the major trend reverse?**__  
  
It depends to the market,I usually look for the daily candle pattern as my other indicator, but when the market is about to change I close all the opening position of course. This is what I do when I noticed and assumed that the market is about to change:  
  
1\. Safe way, not trade when the market is in the midle of changing direction, and continue to ride the market when the trend is clear, this avoiding drawdown, just take 7 days trading in a month and you probably got 1000pips. Strongly recomended to use this way.  
  
2\. Unload the EA and put SL and TP lower (20 - 40 pips) on the opening position, or close all of the opening position even if its negative, and start to load the EA again according to the major trend when I see the major trend is clear.  
  
3.Still trading when the market is about to change, I use this just to confirm when the market is about to changing, when I see the frofit for the day less than 100 pips or even negative (but often still profit but minimum) that means I have to Drive the EA accordingly. But I dont recomend this, I only use this way on the demo.  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
__**How do u recognize a clear major trend?**__  
  
_**Clear down trend**_  
when the chart turns red and the arrow pointing down and the candle pattern confirm it ( I suggest U to learn candle pattern, I got this suggestion from Phillip Nell with his great 4H MACD strategy), thats where the high probability of the next daily candle move down. if one of this indis is not in the line it means that u have to becareful, or much better not to trade, trade 7 days a month is enough to have "maybe" arround 1000pips.  
U can use your own indis as u feel comfort.  
  
_**Clear up trend**_  
vice versa  
  
  
============================================================================  
  
  
**__Why do you use 300pips for the stoploss?__**  
  
300 pips is to give space for the market retracment.  
  
from what I know that it is still save as long as u still follow the daily trend, when it's negative dont worry becouse the market will recover it (as long as u follow the daily trend), its normal to have negative open position becouse this EA will open the position on retracment. Let me show u  
  
Lets say the daily trend pointing to move down , but the price dont moves smoothly down right"?,it retrace (against the daily trend for temporary), when it retrace the EA will open position, it means that it will be negative for a while but soon the market will recover your position to positive becouse you follow the major trend.  
  
**So make sure that u follow a clear trend.**  
  
  
=========================================================  
  
_**_If you see the trend is clear so why you have to use this EA?_**_   
  
My experience is that this EA can catch pips more than the market pip range , for example from January 1st Jan to January 7th the price move down for 500 pips, then this EA can catch more than 500 pips from the price retracement, just try this EA on back test for 1 month on Aug 2008 you will see that.  
  
  
=========================================================  
  
  
__**What pair do you trade?**__  
  
I used GBPUSD and EURUSD or you can try another pair, just look for the pair that shows a clear trend in daily chart.  
  
  
=========================================================

SamuriPower are you using default settings? Such as the 500TP (I assume it would be 50 for 4 digit broker?)  
  
  
By the way, I just grapped a quick 16pips on a short. Live (.01 per pip) lol.  
  
thx,

Yes that is true 500 TP means 50 pips for 5 digit broker platform.  
  
My setting for TP is 100pips, becouse the market moves in large range, the rest is still default. please see the detailed statement.

You will not be able to update the second and third page later on, better extend the first one in chapters and delete 2 and 3.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I've run the expert from 29.1 to 30.1(today) and it shows great profits, but I noticed it is 500 pips T/P and 3,000 pips S/L....  
  
  
It could destroy your account very fast with this kind of S/L's!   
  
  
Also, I have an 'X' near the EA while trying to put it on a chat and let it run on live trading... :S

That 3000 sl is probably a 5 digit conversion that equals 300. Likewise tp is probably 50.

It makes me 500 T/P and 3,000 S/L also, EA isn't working, only on Demo... cause I have 'X' on the top instead of a Smiley!

Hi  
I have few questions.  
  
How do I backtest for any period if there is trend reversal in between.   
Also it seems to trade even if with the setting TradeOnFriday = 0.   
You determine the direction based on brokers timezone?   
  
Thanks

Karun,  
  
yes, u have to drive the EA according to the major trend even its on backtest, drive the EA each time u find a trend reversal.  
  
Like I mention b4, try to backtest it for 1 month on Aug 2008, becouse that month the market shows down move from start to end, drive the EA short only and u will see that.  
  
I determine the direction based on major trend karun.  
  
Please see the discusion link below for better understanding about this setting.

Wailer, you don't need to change that...Keep it 15, it still works fine on 5m chart.

So, what happens if we don't act right away, and don't shut down EA in time!!  
And we shut down at third candle other color. Well, we still kept half of gains, in this case around 1300 pips.   
And that is still very nice, for me anything more than break-even is good.   
  
  
P.s. No problem Samurai, glad so I can help I bit, and still need to learn much much.

First of all, thank you SamuraiPower for sharing your trading technique  
for this EA. I figure if you can read a daily chart, you can make a ton  
of money by "driving" this EA to financial freedom. I've got all the components  
loaded, so I'm ready to rock this Sunday.

Sorry, what does _above 21_ mean? Also, do you wait for the white candle to close before going long?

I coded a version with auto trend from EMA, so you dont need  
to keep a eye on daily chart for the trend......ea will not trade  
buy if price is below ema, and will not sell if price is above ema!!!  
  
You just need to input desired ema period in the first variable I added:  
  
**extern int MainTrendPeriod = 200; \ ma period**

well Rob let me tell u something,overall this setting is profitable but live trading will be different compare to demo, maybe u will tend to control your chart really often, and when emotion involved thats when this setting wont be profitable anymore, make sure u demo it for a long time to overcome the non technical barrier.

21 EMA is to confirm how strong the trend is from the angle degree.  
I use candle pattern as my early warning for a trend reversal, and pay attention to close the trade.

Will this EA continue to open positions in the same direction after the TP or SL has been hit? Or, will it hit the TP or SL and wait for the next signal to open another position? TIA!

I know SamuraiPower has preferred pairs, but would it be a good idea  
to go through 10-12 charts, to find those with the strongest trends?  
  
Also, I was wondering if it would be advantageous to pick the best  
short pair, and the best long pair, and run the two together. I just  
looked at my charts with the template and found good candidates  
for both.

I have been thinking about this for a while, but not sure I like what I am understanding....  
  
Let's say that you trade with the trend. Okay, a good idae, but that day the pair goes against you. Let's say that it is GbpUsd and moved 400 pips against your trend trade.  
  
Now, every 40 pips that the trade moves against you, it opens another trade with the trend. So, at the end of the day you could literally be down over 2000 pips with 3 trades stoping out at 300 Pips in loss.  
  
Now, the next day the pair trades back with the trend, except it doesn't move against you at all and you take profit at 100 pips. That means that 1 day you lost over 2000 and the next won 100. This is a really scary thought for me.  
  
I will put it on a demo account, because I am not sure if I am understanding the technicals right. I wil determine trend and set the EA accordingly.

Hi FOREXflash,  
  
First of all i would really thanks for your effort. Actually I was thinking to automated this reversal thing, but i have no knowledge at all about programing, and i dont know where to ask, when I start to post this thread I know that someday a programer will try to automated this EA based on my idea, I was thinking whats the name is gonna be if its become fully automated, since that its quick and beyond my expectation Im still thinking hard now.  
  
I really appreciate your effort, i'll try to compare it with semiautomatic and give u feedback, thanks FOREXflash.

That's a good idea Rob! Please keep us posted on your findings! :-)  
  
Also, you may want to use this tool to test multiple pairs. GL!

Instructions from original post:  
**  
This "indicator" is actually an EA. The EA does not generate trades, it simply reads the closed orders from your account history.  
  
This version allows you to enter 10 separate currency pairs to monitor. The EA will display for each selected pair the number of closed trades, profit, number of wins, win profit, number of losses, and loss profit for each separate pair. It also will display the totals for all the closed trades, closed profit, closed wins, closed win profit, closed losses, and closed loss profit.  
  
Save this file and attach as an EA. Attach to any chart. Set the chart to a line chart, and select the color for line graph as "None".**

Ea works exactly like original, but the only difference is that it will  
not buy if price is below ma, or sell if price is above ma!!!

My suggestions,  
The EA will work excelent in a very clear trending pair. So for me its easy to find the most clear trending pair by visually looking at the daily chart of each pair.  
Anyone of u can pick your own favourable pair.

damonl I was backtesting using 350 pip SL and even if it opened up 2 or 3 positions, the total SL never went over 350 pips for those positions. I don't think it's 350 per trade.

I was wondering about that to. Glad to hear that is the case and not the other way which I thought it might be. Still wondering about leaving open for 100 pips in profit. If you catch the trend early, either pair could go for 300 pips per day for multiple days.  
  
Question...if you are up in the trend +75 pips and the trade moves back down to +35 pips and the step is set to 40, would a new trade open here?

Yes Damonl, u are absolutely correct, im affraid i have to be agrre with u, thats what we call the worst case scenario. But there is no perfect system in this whole universe right? otherwise we all a Pipslionare by now. every trading system has a risk, even the best strategy 4H MACD from Phillip Nell, and they have a method to minimize the risk.  
  
So here is my opinion to counter the worst case scenario.  
  
Its rarely to happen when the market extreemly suddenly reversal more than 300pips to the opposite direction,   
and if it reverse in a large range in the opposite direction the market will show the signal first then u would've been notice first and act before its against u, but if u still don't or can't recognize it then i have to say that this forex market is not your world to gain profit.  
So trade when the trend is clear, u guys know how to do that right?.  
  
yes its true that based on my experience once I loss 600pips a day (If i loss more than 1500pips it means I have to learn a lot more), but after profiting for days with let say thousands of pips. The point is if u focus on the accumulating result at the end of the month it will give u hundreed or even thousand of pips per month when u using it correctly.  
  
Based on my experience, for your own safety I think u have to put 0.1lot for every $10.000 capital  
  
Let me give u a simple conclusion  
Im gonna pick $5000 as my illustration becouse for most of us it is consider as a huge money to give away = 300 is consider to big for a stoploss   
  
**ARE U WILLING TO GIVE THE FOREX MARKET YOUR $5,000 FROM YOUR POCKET TO HAVE $15,000 BACK IN YOUR POCKET?**  
  
Do you still think that this is the worst case that will happens to you?

Samurai, your tp 50 or 100? I've seen both mentioned.  
  
Interesting to see firebird again. I traded this years ago in various forms. Directional is best, but 40 pipstep can be too small sometimes.

Hi Samurai  
  
Been following your postings for the past few weeks & must say I am very impressed with what you have done. I think the firebird has always had the potential to be a winner, just needed someone to point it in the right direction. I did use firebird v3.1 for a while last year & was wondering why you favour v63g when the v3.1 version has more functions i.e. hedging, money management, daily time management etc, or is it a case of keep it simple.  
Anyway have downloaded your files with the v63g ready for Sunday night.  
Thanks again for you hard work & sharing it with us.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Best Wishes

Should we consider use of daily fib levels?  
  
For now I was more or less scalping on 1m and 5m, and fib levels are great tool and something not to be ignored.   
Mabey someone trading only dailys can explain usage of fibs on that TF. !??  
  
Thanks

I have download the indicator you posted, and can't load it on my charts,  
  
Do I only need to MODIFY the Expert like this :  
  
extern int MainTrendPeriod = 200; ma period  
extern int MA_length = 10;  
extern int MA_timeframe = 15; // hdb did I add this ? lol  
extern int MAtype = 0;//0=close, 1=HL   
extern double Percent = 0.1;  
extern int TradeOnFriday = 1; // >0 trades on friday  
extern int slip = 100;//exits only  
extern double Lots = 0.1; // modified by Renato  
extern int TakeProfit = 100;  
extern int Stoploss = 300;// total loss on all open positions in pips // modified by Renato  
//extern double TrailingStop = 5;  
  
so I've added the top line as what you said?!

ForexFlash,  
  
What EMA should we put in, so that the EA behaves according  
to the daily chart template? Or, is it the same period EMA in  
template? Is the EA looking at a daily time frame, or a M5 time frame?

yes gasgas, i actually familiar with fibs, never think bout it b4, i think that is a good idea, since i use daily candle pattern for exit strategy quite often as an early warning. im gonna aply it then.

EA looks at the used timeframe(5min)....  
just edit the first variable I added in the ea:   
  
**extern int MainTrendPeriod = 200;**_(this is exponential ma, with close price)_  
  
Just edit this to the period you want to use for the trend detection!!!  
  
but if you want ema to use daily tf....here it is.

Hi Stern-Capita  
  
What **FOREXflash** made available was a modified **EA** with a default MA period of 200 which may need to be adjusted subject to forward testing.  
You need to place this in your expert folder then replace your current **EA** with this one.

Paul

Dont know if you guys know this but EA has 5 unused variables in it:  
  
Close these trades  
Close Lossing trades  
iFX analyser  
Goal Check  
Get Slipagge  
  
  
_Also there is a variable that isnt external..._  
  
**int Direction; //1=long, 11=avoid long, 2=short, 22=avoid short**  
  
By using this you can limit ea to make only this trades,   
if you guys want I can make this external so you can choose trades!

Thanks, FF. I took an M5 chart and placed a 200 EMA on it. Looks like  
it should do the job and keep the EA out of troubled territory.   
  
BTW, thanks for you valuable contributions. The people on ForexFactory  
are a great bunch of individuals.

Hi  
  
Will we need to use a magic no if used on more than 1 chart, same MT4?  
I am hoping to forward test on perhaps 4 pairs.

also on backtest, it doesn't let me change T/P & S/L it sets itself to 500 T/P and 3,000 S/L... how do I change it!?  
  
  
And using your EA ForexFlash, on backtest, will it know when to do sell/buy according to the EMA?!

If you want to use ea on few pairs, every ea NEED to have a different MagicNumber!!!!  
Also if you want to make ea trade only one direction, you can make it   
by changing the variable for that!

Thanks, ForexFlash for your contributions. With your latest EA with  
magic numbers, is there a way to set the EMA to look at the M5 time  
frame?

The magicnumber & direction functions are still set to internal.  
Can you please set to external.

ForexFlash,  
  
In the code, where you can select long, avoid long, short, avoid short,  
does this mean the EA is directional? How can it auto-trend if it can  
only be set one way, or is it overridden by the positions selection in  
the Common tab, where you can select long & short?

when we backtest using the EA ForexFlash have modified and re-created, will it trade both ways? LONG/SHORT?! so we can test say a month back and see both long & short positions openning?!  
  
  
  
and how I change IN BACKTEST the t/p & s/l?! they don't want to be changed, set to 500 and 3000 ahhh :S

I see that the direction can now be selected in the inputs. How would  
you set it to go long and short? It looks like you have to select one or  
the other.

Hi all,  
  
According to my indis, candle pattern, news, I got a little bit insight for still driving the EA long for tomorrow, but still have to watch for the price action, if fibs level at 1.4415 breaks it means i have to be carefull.

I want to verify your EA setttings...  
  
I determine trend and only go long or short trades based on trend...no problem.  
  
You are using a 100p pip take profit, a 300 pip s/l and a 40 pip step, is that correct?  
  
Are you leaving all the other EA settings to default at this time?

The old versions of firebird already had magics, just not as an extern. The rule long ago was to trade it on several pairs, and it had to have magics to do that. I'm sure the version samurai posted with the traderseven suffix has magics already. TraderSeven, by the way, was the originator of firebird if I recall correctly.

Thanks Samurai Power for starting this innovative (but yet simple) method of trading Firebird.  
  
I used to demo trade it in the past but got disillusioned with the huge draw downs. I will be following your instructions closely.  
  
I picked up on this thread on Friday and got so excited about trading your method, that I started counting down the hours to when the market would open.  
  
Since market opened, I am up 332 pips on my $1000 demo account.   
This is an excellent start. I know this does not mean much since the market quickly giveth and can just as quickly taketh. Time will tell.  
  
I have kept default values except switched amounts to 4 digit values. I use FXDD.  
  
I was wondering, would profitability suffer if EA had an adjustable break even amount. I am up 23 pips on this trade now and I would not want this winner to change into a loser.  
  
Maybe break even at 25 pips, or possibly 25 pips and lock in 5 pips.  
  
Thanks again for thinking outside the box!

Interesting Everett, mine has only opened one position since the begining of the day (almost 6 hours ago) how many trades has the EA opened today and how many pairs are using this EA on.  
  
Thanks

it depends on the market ezzy, a very clear trending market with retracement is the most preferable by this EA, its gonna be often when u see -250pips on the opening position before the market recover your position to +300pips or even more at the end of the day.

This EA is very powerfull on finding entry setup yet very weak on exit, so cover this negative side with your brain, coz it is more effective and more profitable.

I am testing 3 versions on GBPUSD. One is daily auto trend direction (5 min chart), second is auto 5 min. trend (5 min chart), and third is 5/8 open daily trend direction (1 min chart).  
  
Since market opened, 11 trades have closed.

Hi all,  
  
i am testing this system since few days  
very thanks to samuraiPower that did an excellent job and is a joy to speak with him.  
  
Just one question,  
every time I do something wrong when I have to understand the daily trend,  
everytime I see long and then goes short and viceversa.  
  
  
One thing I would like to ask (I know I have to study some indicators and charts too to better understand)  
is how are going the EAs **FOREXflash** has developed,  
  
Everett and who are using them, could you post some samples?  
I am very interested in understand if these EA could provide a good base on avoiding misunderstanding..  
  
  
Thanks to all  
regards

Hi FOREXflash  
I've tested your EA on EU M30 ( instead of M5).  
With Direction=0 or 1 , I have only SELL ?????  
What Direction setting is necessary to make a good backtest BUY and SELL ?  
Thanks.

Its happens today, extreemly huge trend reversing for G/U, as i predicted if the price breaks those level the trend will reverse but I dont expect its gonna be extreem again today, this is what makes this EA dangerous, this system is not perfect as u've seen.

I'm testing the following:  
  
Original Firebird v63 Trader Seven, one long trade,one short trade,  
based on the Samurai's template.  
  
ForexFlash's auto-trend Firebird, on the same two pairs as above.  
  
So far, each of the above EAs has closed one trade for 75 pips(I lowered  
it from 100, since I am using different pairs).

I have one closed short trade from the manual Firebird,  
and one closed trade from the auto-trend Firebird(M5).  
  
I'm not sure about the pairs, since I'm at work, but I  
think my long trade is USDCHF, and my short trade is  
NZDUSD.

Hi Guys  
  
I set FOREXflash's auto trend EA running at 2300 gmt yesterday & from 0000 gmt until 0900 it took 6 shorts each for 50 pips a total of 300 pips![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).  
  
I have left the EA to seek its own direction using the 200 period setting & set the TP for 50 pips.  
  
As I write its just entered another short trade.  
  
Things are looking good thanks to Samurai & FOREXflash.

Hey Paul,  
  
Are you using the M5 or daily version for the auto-trend EA?  
  
I'm using the M5 version.

Cool, we're on the same page. I have mine for 75 TP.

I am not sure I understand your question.  
  
I am using FXDD as broker with demo account.  
I only have my statement from trades, is that what you are asking?

I'm currently running the "driving" Firebird, USDCHF long only, and  
NZDUSD, short only. Charts attached from Samurai's daily template.  
Both pairs still look good, so I will let Firebird run another day.  
So far, it has banked 75 pips on a NZDUSD short, and there are  
four open trades(2 buy, 2 sell)with a neg float of $-86. This is  
on IBFX with flat 1 lots at $1/pip.  
  
I'm also running ForexFlash's auto-trend M5 EA on the exact same  
pairs. So far, it has banked 75 pips on a NZDUSD short, and 65 pips  
on a USDCHF short. USDCHF is my long pair for the manual Firebird,  
but auto-trend decided to short it anyway, for a nice gain. There  
are two open trades, with a positive float of $12. I'm running this  
EA on FXDD at .1 lots, which are $1/pip.  
  
Here are the daily charts for USDCHF(long), and NZDUSD(short)

I wish this performance would continue, but I know the reality of forex.  
  
Statement is attached for Feb. so far.  
  
Please ignore the other ea's I was doing a test.  
  
The three losses on firebird was caused by me, panic close.  
  
I noticed that only sells were traded during this period with firebird. It was set do do auto trend detection. I probably have a wrong setting.  
  
Statement says IBFX, but is actually FXDD demo.

Paul or Rob or anyone,  
  
Can you please point me to the post where I can download FOREXflash's EA. I tried to search for it but there are so many posts that he has written and I'm not sure which one you're talking about.  
  
Thanks for the help

I added two more pairs, since I was seeing positive float on the first two.  
I have three closed trades, all shorts, for a total of 214 pips.  
  
I have seven open trades, six short and one long, with a neg float  
of -$45.  
  
It *does* appear that this EA favors short trades.

This might be a dumb question. How do you set original EA posted by Samuraipower to trade long or short only? I do not see any settings to do that. I didn't see any1 asking this questions so i know i must be missing somehting lol

Hi Rob  
So you have a long trade .  
Please what pair ?  
Curiously all my backtests with this EA and several pairs for 6 months have never shown BUY trades !!!!!!  
Curiously also the backtests with direction=1 are providing only SELL trades !!!!  
And you ?

Maybe the EA looks at 200 ema on daily chart instead of 5M? Not sure which pairs you back tested but certain pairs were in stron downtrend since august or so and probably didn't go over 200 ema on daily chart very often if at all. I dunno, just guessing.

Hi madscalp  
I'm not really following this thread and I'm not sure if you've already tried this but it might help. If you press "Expert properties" in the bottom right in the picture and the press the tab "Testing" in the box, and then choose from the list whatever direction on the trades you like. Hope this helps.

Yes it repaints, don't make judgment just based on arrows, they are there just to give you little forward insight.  
  
  
Zomg, attache EA on chart, left click on it, and click where you see ''common'', there you can change. Long only for buy trades, or Short Only for sell trades.

No problem,  
  
I also didn't think about that, to drive EA only short or long. Samurai show us that.

Hi NowAndLater  
Of course, I know this option but it uses for the first basic EA provided by Samourai.  
The Forexflash EA is normally autotrend i.e it is trading according to the 200 EMA.  
So this EA have to take BUY or SHORT according to this EMA.  
I have tried several backtests and several pairs with direction = 0 , 1 , 2 , 11 or 22 and every time the orders are SELL !  
In my opinion it seems to take SHORT only.  
You can check.

I know why.  
  
Let me show U some example with FOREXflash daily autotrend EA.  
  
First of course u set Long and Short on the EA since this is an autotrend EA right? and u set 200 EMA as a cut off for the EA to reverse the direction.  
Like FOREXflash said, the EA won't open SELL if the price ABOVE the EMA, and the EA won't open BUY if the price BELOW the EMA.  
  
Now look at the daily chart pic below with 5 month history.   
  
The the price is BELOW the EMA for the last 5 month, it means it wont buy if the price always BELOW the EMA even if there is an up trend in the daily candle.  
  
See the numbers I pointed in the pic  
  
Number 1 : up move for 1247 pips  
Number 2 : up move for 1029 pips  
Number 3 : up move for 1028 pips  
  
if U dont do anything of course u are gonna blow your account. Adjust the EMA value on the EA to maximize how the EA to recognize the trend then the EA will open the buy position.  
The rules is the same on the 5M Autotrend EA

Thanks for explanation.  
But EA with direction=1 (only BUY ) is opening only SELL trades!  
There is a problem in the EA code.

Hi FOREXFlash,  
  
  
I think using only EMA for the EA to recognizing the trend changing is not enough, it'll be too late to spot the trend changing even though the EA will notice it in the end.  
  
For example see the daily chart pic below.  
  
Let say I use the daily autotrend EA, and I set the EMA value to 8. See each number and the line I pointed for the specified date.  
  
Number 1.  
The price is below the EMA and surely the EA won't open Buy and it will continue to open sell, and its obviously up move for hundreeds of pips that day. it means the EA trade against the trend and leaving several position with 300 SL each.  
  
its happens to number, 2,3,4,5 and 6 also  
  
So based on that could u change EMA as a basic tools for the EA to recognize the trend changing with Haiken Ashi and Crossing of two EMA (Arrow indicator) as I pointed in the first post.  
  
Summary of exit strategy  
I spotted the trend reversal on the daily chart with Heiken Ashi and crossing of 2 EMA's (Arrow indicator), plus daily candle pattern as an early warning (I added fibs level now). If trend reversal is spotted, I close all open position and open another position to the opposite direction according to the trend.  
Can U translate my theory of this exit strategy into code programing on the EA?  
  
Or perhaps u already did it? if yes can u share with us? Thank u so much.  
  
Kindly Regards,  
Samurai Power

Absolutely zero knowledge about programing, but according to my test it doesnt effect anything.

I posted earlier that this might be why but I also thought that the EA that has M5 in the name was using 200 EMA on 5 min chart and not daily. I think thats the one they are using. I might be wrong.

My backtests with direction=1 also are providing only SELL trades even bars are over 200 EMA on daily chart. Madscalp is right this EA have to take BUY or SHORT according to this EMA and not to "BUY and SELL Expert properties". I think we have to ask FOREXflash to check the code.

Quite new to forex as well as MT4 and want to thank all people on this and other threads for the enthusiasm and ideas.  
  
I have gone through the code posted by ForexFlash and do think there is an issue with brackets. ForexFlash, below i post an extract of a local copy that i made which does seem to do both buy and sell:  
  
if(   
MarketAnalize()==-1   
&& myMA*(1+Percent/100)<Bid   
&& Direction!=22   
&& (Bid>=(LastPrice+(CurrentPipStep*Point)) || MyOrdersTotal()==0)   
&& RVI<0   
) // modified by Renato  
{  
LogWrite("SELL: " + MarketAnalize() + " myMA: " + myMA + "Bid: " + Bid + "Direction: " + Direction + "LastPrice: " + LastPrice + "MyOrdersTotal: "+ MyOrdersTotal() + "RVI: " + RVI);  
OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,slip,Bid+(Stoploss*Point),Bid-(TakeProfit*Point),GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenSell); // modified by Renato  
ret = 1;  
}   
if(  
MarketAnalize()==1   
&& myMA*(1-Percent/100)>Ask   
&& Direction!=11   
&& (Ask<=(LastPrice-(CurrentPipStep*Point)) || MyOrdersTotal()==0)   
&& RVI>0   
) // Go LONG -> Only buy if >= 30 pips below previous position entry // modified by Renato  
{  
LogWrite("BUY: " + MarketAnalize() + " myMA: " + myMA + "Bid: " + Bid + "Direction: " + Direction + "LastPrice: " + LastPrice + "MyOrdersTotal: "+ MyOrdersTotal() + "RVI: " + RVI);  
OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_BUY,Lots,Ask,slip,Ask-(Stoploss*Point),Ask+(TakeProfit*Point),GetCommentForOrder(),MagicNumber,0,clOpenBuy); // modified by Renato  
ret = 2;  
}  
  
Please check and see if this was the intention.

Hi,  
  
I hope ForexFlash doesn't mind too much. I'm happy for him (or her) to take on my changes and integrate into a possible V3 after rectifying what i've done. For now, please find attached my version as Firebird_auto_trend_FE.mq4  
  
I have included an automatic close facility for when the price seems to run away too far in the wrong direction based on an 300 SMA. It seems to help in certain cases, but happy to receive comments.

That's why I said ForexFlash should rectify what I've done ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
However, I'm surprised that it doesn't buy for you. For me it just opened a buy on NZDUSD at 0.50965 (Demo account)  
  
Now it's at 0.51385  
  
Which currency pair are you looking at and have u done a back test?

Thank you very much, Samurai Power, for the trading system.  
  
I am preparing to run the latest version of the EA.  
  
Is it necessary to have to have a different magic number in the EA for each pair it is running on?  
  
It may have already been posted somewhere, but I missed it.  
  
Thanks for the help,  
PD

Put the FireBird AutoTrend EMA(m5)V2 EA on EUR/USD and GBP/USD, and it opened a short trade on the EU, which is currently up 26 PIPS. So far, so good.

Sell trade on GBP/USD opened and closed at 50 PIPS profit. EA opened two new sell orders on the EUR and GBP not long after the two winning trades were closed.

Started demo testing today.  
  
Running: Firebird_auto_trend_FE posted by FredElla on post #163.  
  
It opened the following trades:  
  
audusd buy  
eurusd buy  
usdchf sell  
nzdusd buy  
usdcad sell  
gbpjpy buy  
eurjpy buy  
  
It sets the TP at 500 pips, the SL at 3000 pips.  
  
Same magic number on all.

Thanx b4 Fredella, yes the main problem here is how to recognize the trend reversal and how to manage it to minimize the risk. Some of us using manual recognizing and some of us prefer to use EA.  
Honestly im still cuorious bout using only Moving Average to recognize trend reversal for the EA, can u please help us on changing it to heiken ashi and EMA crossover just like I mentioned on post 153 and 156?   
  
thanks alot

Samurai,  
  
I have had some success using a 1 period MA to find the short-term direction for other trading methods.  
  
You might find this useful.  
  
Settings:  
SMA  
Period 1  
Shift 1  
Median Price (HL/2)

Hi All,  
  
I'm a newbie and just found this threat. My high expectation to make pips with this EA as SamuraiPower does. However when I upload the EA on my demo account, it gives me lots of these msgs on the Expert tab:  
  
2009.02.04 12:52:24 Firebird v63G trader seven GBPUSD,M5: Account equity = 5000  
.....  
.....(every second)...  
  
Is this normal? OR some error on my end? Any help are highly appreciated.  
  
Cheers

Brilliant Pistol Dave,I never think about using 1 SMA, I just remember that the arrow indicator I posted on post 1 is based on Crossing between 1 and 2 EMA, it might be very usefull.  
Im very cuorious, can U please backtest it with long and short setting since im wrtting this on the pda, and please post the reasult here. Thanks

SP,   
Thanks for your reply.   
Yes, I have adjust it to my platform...(4&5 digit). I tried it on FXDD, [FXPRO](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile"), and IBFX. All come up with the same Expert msg. I used the one you posted on the post #1.   
  
This not happen when I try the other version (Firebird_auto_trend_FE.mq4 & Firebird_auto trend_EMA(m5)V2.mq4). Any thought?

Sorry I got this one wrong, I thought that Fredella already put this SMA code to the EA wich looks for daily chart.  
when I see the chart on post 177, if someone can put it on the EA i think it would filter between long and short quite good.

Hi, am doing a paid job right now. The EA I posted would be using 5M SMA. Will try the daily SMA tonight. I saw some post on magic numbers as well. Is there an issue there?   
  
For the message spamming issue, could u check if you have the Expert variable WriteLog (or logWrite) set to 1 perhaps?

Either that or something. All trades taken on the EUR/USD and GBP/USD have been short. Currently have 4 open short trades on the GBP, which are down 260 PIPS. Am using the auto trend EA

My intention was to help you guys with the daily trend detection, cos originator   
of the thread said that you need to look at the daily trend and then  
accordingly to that, set the ea manualy to do the short or long trades,  
and that is all I did.......  
I didnt looked to much at the code, cos I realy dont have interest  
in this ea, but Im willing to help. Im at work now, so some time later, ill  
go through code, check for errors...etc. I must admit that I didnt even test it  
before posting the revised code here!  
  
Samuraipower, if you want to code something in the ea, Im listening!

Hi forexflash and fredella,  
  
First i want to thank for spending your valuable time here, trying to share some knowledge just to fulfill our cuoriousity to make this idea more easy to trade.  
I must admit i have to put the thread called semiauto becouse i dont have the ability to code,despite that i know some of our fellow here just like u will then find this trade and helping us to code. Just wishing that my "half manual" idea will be automated and validly confirmed profit.  
The major issue now is how to make the EA effectively recognize the trend reversal on the daily chart automaticly.  
And for others keep demoing and post the result so that the rest of us can learn from it.  
  
Regards  
Samurai Power

I'm forward testing the Firebird_autotrend_EMA(m5)v2 right now.  
  
It does not seem to place trades with any regard to the 200 moving average.  
  
In other words, it places sell orders when price is rising and above the 200 ma, and will buy when the price is below the ma.  
  
Even when you change the "Direction" number to 1 or 2 it still places short or long orders regardless of that number. It seems to be ignoring the 200 ma.

yes i tried it on back test and it seems still need optimization. Im still sticking with manual driving the EA but off for today becouse the price is in balance beetween long and short, need to see the price action tomorrow.Going to jump to the street again and drive the EA when the trend is clear.

Hi FOREXflash,  
  
Yes, actually I got this idea from pistoldave on post 177, by looking at his chart using only one moving average with this setting...  
  
SMA period : 1  
Shift : 1  
Median Price (HL/2)  
On the daily chart  
  
...will help improove the EA to recognize the trend reversal. I think fredella is working on it too. Thank U so much FOREXflash.

I had some settings wrong in that one, so I had to start over again with it on another platform.  
  
I'm running it now and also the Firebird_autotrend_EMA(m5)v2. This v2 seems to be working right, but like I said earlier, I don't have any way to control whether it opens a long or short trade.  
  
I'll let you know how they work out.  
  
PD

There is no problem with the ea execution......  
EA consist of 2 trading parts, first is to take a trade in the direction of the  
daily trend, and the second is to take a few trades acordingly to the ea rules, and that means that you can have one buy, and few sells one after  
another no matter what the daily trend is........  
regarding the timeframes, use ea on 5min TF, cos ea is intended for that!

Can you code in a break even function?  
  
It would be good to adjust stop loss to break even + X amount of pips after say 25 pips in profit.

Firstly: thanks to ForexFlash for your work here and others you know who you are.   
Secondly: As for all systems we need to have some sort of enter and exit. Its not wise just start EA in the middle of downtrend, retrace can happen any day, and can go over 300pips up.   
I put simply CCI (14) on daily chart with zero line, -100 and +100 lines. Now,   
for entry (start) could be also used cci crossing zero line with high angle.   
For safe exit: or to give EA a day off (pause), we could use cci hitting -100 line from opposite direction than trend (if downtrend). See Picture...  
And maybe turn EA on again, when cci breaks -100 line and goes down again.  
  
In backtesting, this looks like safe exit enough. Will do forward test to see how it goes.

Ran FE version all day today on a 5 decimal broker and it never opened a trade. I don't know why.  
  
The EMA(m5)v2 version continues to perform the same as usual, opening longs and shorts with no regard to the 200 ma. It has the same undesirable problems as these "grid" type EAs, in that they will leave lots of unrealized drawdown while they make realized profit. Then some day you have to close all the open positions and there goes your profit.  
  
I'm through testing it. I've seen enough. I wish you the best of luck with it.

I might be misunderstanding things here but according to Samurais original approach to the use of this EA would require that EA takes only trades in the direction of the trend. So it seems that if EA makes any trades counter trend then its probably wrong according to his strategy. I think we need to override any counter trend trades and have trades taken only and only in the direction of the trend but still according to EA logic.

FOREXflash,  
  
I have an idea and anyone else could and should comment on it. How about coding the EA to go long or short based on the direction of the arrows from the template on the daily chart? I remember someone saying the arrows repaint, and I think that's ok because this will just give us a general idea when the trend is turning. Is creating an EA to do what I am talking about possible?  
  
If it is possible, I think the EA needs to close all open positions for that pair when the direction changes. So if we're currently in "long mode" and we have 2 open trades, when we see a pink down arrow, the 2 open long trades need to be closed and the EA on the 5 min chart needs to be in "short mode." Does this make sense? And is it possible?  
  
All feedback is welcome.

Hi friends and Forexflash  
  
I agree with pistoldave, my results so far with the EMA(m5)v2 version have bought and sold regardless of the 200 EMA.  
  
On a positive note I have had no losses with this version on my demo as yet, since the 2/2.  
  
I will continue to demo and relay my results to this thread.  
  
So far, so good fflash <http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif>

Another strategy for London traders with the basic semiautomatic EA by Samurai is to consider the daily pivot of the pair before London open.  
If the price is under daily pivot --> long only.  
If the price is above daily pivot --> short only.  
This morning, it was good for EU , GU and EY.

Hi iopoipoi  
  
I have not changed anything on that version, settings are standard. Since the 2/2, it has opened and closed a number of trades, all closed trades have been profitable, two of them have been buys so far.  
  
To be honest, I quite like it. I will continue to demo it for a few more weeks, if it continues to give me these kind of results, I may try it live on mini lots .01 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

No problems mate, I am happy to share my results  
  
I am using the following;  
  
gpb/usd = 4 profitable trades (50 pips each) = 200 pips  
aud/usd = 4 profitable trades (50 pips each) = 200 pips  
eur/usd = 3 profitable trades (50 pips each) = 150 pips  
usd/chf = 3 profitable trades (50 pips each) = 150 pips  
  
Total = 1000 pips in 4 days. ( all on demo of course).  
  
sorry, thats a total of 700 pips not 1000. 

What you do is a reflection of you....what I do is a reflection of me.

In my opinion, one downfall iopoipoi.  
  
I think that most trades will be profitable on this ea (from my few results so far) but drawdown can be pretty bad. I am thinking of trying one of 2 things;  
  
1) next week I will try turning ea on Monday and turn it off Wed and let the trades run untill the following Monday when I will turn ea on again etc etc  
  
2) otherwise maybe adjusting the pipstep to a greater number, this will probably eliminate having 3-4 trades on the same currency at the same time.  
  
We'll see how it goes.

The thing is to be correct on the trend. If you're not, you can not only have big drawdowns, but big losses. Ask 10 people how you can know the current trend will stay that way, and you get 10 different answers. You can go with the last day, the last few days, the last week, or use a moving average cross, or whatever, but I've yet to see anyone get it right consistently. It's fine when the GBP is trending your way and you make lots of pips. Not so fine when it keeps changing, or suddenly reverses, and you're down 200 plus PIPS on 3 to 5 positions.

It's still about the TREND! If you get the trend right, you're fine. You know the old saying of The trend is you friend. Here's one I made up "The trend is a fickle friend, often telling you to kiss her rear end. She leaves you in the lurch, waving goodbye; Standing there penniless, Left all alone to cry".

Well..here is the one I made up "Make the trend to be your friend",   
HOW?  
I drive the EA to make the trend to be my best friend.  
  
I show U the detail statement when the first time I found this idea. Find the attachment below and learn it.  
  
_**From 23 Sept 2008 to 13 Oct 2008 (15 days trading)**_  
I tried with multiple pair at a time that time: GBPUSD, EURUSD, NZDUSD, EURGBP, USDCHF, GBPJPY, AUDUSD, USDJPY, USDCAD, EURJPY.  
  
started to run this idea from 23 Sept 2008 and the result is quite amazing, the setting was default, 300SL each, 50TP each, except for EURGBP I was set TP to 40.   
There was drawdown as u can see on the graph but still I managed to get **6851 pips** in only 15 days trading.   
I didnt continue demo becouse from the result I've seen more than enough.  
I analyze the most profitable pair is GBPUSD and EURUSD becouse the EA open more position than other pairs.  
  
_**From 27 Oct 2008.......**_  
I was thingking if I set the TP to 100, maybe the result is gonna be more than amazing, ...then after several days the result is just like what I was expected, there was drawdown also just like before as u can see on the graph, but then I managed again to get few thousand pips in just several days trading.  
But I didnt continuing demo intensively again becouse again I've seen more than enough.  
  
_That when I was found the strategy called "Semiautomatic EA (Driven Version)_  
  
  
**_NOW_**  
I found this idea with the strategy and the setting and then I opened this thread just to share u a good thing I found, hoping that I can get more pips in my life, it means discuss how to minimize more the drawdown, since I know that lots of people is smarter than me, get some new suggestion and stuff and bla...bla..bla..., including automatisize the "manual drive" (I'm stupid on coding things)  
  
Just keep demoing and find best setting fits your style.

Hi paradoxical  
  
I would prefer if the ea would take trades according to the 200 moving average, however it doesn't.  
  
I am just posting my results so far.  
  
In addition to your comments, after so many positive trades so far, I got two losses last night -300 pips x2 = -600 pips (on demo ofcourse).  
  
I will keep demoing and trying different scenarios to see what happens.  
  
Cheers  
Ezzy

Hi SamuraiPower,  
  
I think your system is very very good  
  
the results you made are the proof of that  
  
  
I also think it is quite difficult to alwasys understand the daily trend, at least for me  
  
also because sometime the trend change during the day  
  
  
So I think with a big interest the automated version.  
  
  
Until this morning, GMT + 1  
  
the last ForexFlash EA did very well yesterday on EUR/USD (the one I am testing), Long and Short  
  
Even the FE version, but with only one trade for two days  
  
  
This morning the two were in loss  
  
  
There is one thing I would like to ask,  
excuse SamuraiPower, why a 300 stop loss?  
  
I would not be better a 150? 200?  
  
I think that is very hard a recover from a -250 pips loss  
so maybe it would be better cut the ones are going down  
  
Do you have a different thinking or experience?  
  
  
I think with a little more tweaking this could be an high potential EA  
  
  
thanks again Samurai  
and thanks to everyone put their time and efforts on it

Hi,  
  
what do u guys think about backtesting? If I do that over several months, it seems 300 is a good value. If you make it smaller there is a chance your causing a loss when the trade potentially can still be in profit if it turns around.  
  
I agree that at least on GBP/USD the EA is causing losses. I guess this is because there is currently no real trend, it's bouncing up and down.

Results of the morning with Samurai EA:  
at London open :  
EU daily pivot above price --> only long --> 1 winner trade  
GU daily pivot under price --> only short --> 1 winner trade + 1 pending  
EG daily pivot above price --> only long --> 1 winner trade  
I'm checking 5 pairs EU, GU, UY, EY and EG.  
No trading on UY (too much near daily pivot )   
EY was "only long" but EA didn't take trade ....why ?????  
Total = 150 pips

This is a daily chart.  
  
The yellow line is a bigger trend line showing a down trend, and the blue one is the smaller trend line showing up trend, if the price breaks the yellow upper line it means the uptrend continuation to more than 1.5xxx, but if it holds it might fall toward the lower yellow line.  
  
Mean while the heiken ashi and the arrow still showing an uptrend, but I have to be carefull becouse the price is near the major resistance. Anticipation mode is turned on

Hi Fredella  
Could you check if your EA version is playing the pipsteps ( 40 pips in basic version ) ?  
It seems not to work for me.

I dont know iopoipoi, but I did learn how to interpretate news (which is never get expert on this), how to read candle pattern (4H MACD Phillip Nell is a good thread), how to draw a trend line (Psiholog thread is the best one), read lots of articles and this..and that..., this is long journey and not easy, but when u understand its quite simple.  
  
Me, myself not sure weather the fully auto EA can cover that, but for believers please keep trying.  
  
300 SL can cover the retrace, but when the trend is clear 200SL can accomodate the profit catching.

I tried on backtest but its still too late on recognizing the trend reversal Fredella, I think gasgas idea by using cci 14 would be good, beouse it will make the EA trade in a clear trend only, leaving the the drawdown behind when the trend reversing.

Based on my analisys GU is long madscalp, but major news tonight might cancel this bull scenario,who knows...  
  
based on my experience japanese yen was rarely open position, maybe its becouse of the code, GU and EU opened position most often.

I see most of senior trader here using trend line, horisontal line and candle pattern as a basic tools to predict support and resistance level, they using it to spot psych level of the price, definately have to lear more about it.

just cuorious to see the price movement update on 1H chart. I think it tries to touch the lower green wall, but if the price hold on orange line it has the opportunity to go up again.

Hi all,  
  
Detail statement attached, from 16 Jan 09.

Below is my post on 1st Feb...

Hi, I'm now using ForexFlash latest version, not mine anymore. I'll check later if i can find anything wrong, although i don't think it will always step in after 40 pips in the wrong direction, there are more conditions. Maybe Samuray can give his opinion on this.   
  
I noticed that ForexFlash had put his 1 day 1 shift average change only in the OpenHighLow version, so if you want to use it make sure you set the MAtype flag to 1.

The market range is 167pips from low to high, but I managed to get +300pips until now today, and +57pips on running position. For total **2,531 pips** from 16 Jan 2009

Very nice S-Power![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
and from only one pair...  
  
Well, when I tested few pairs, I didn't give them all enough observation, and didn't exit safe. So there were losses.  
And when a traded only one pair, max two. I get good resoults.  
So basically me personally will concentrate on one max two pairs, and give them a deep look when will trade..news, technical analys bla bla...

Hi Samurai Power,  
  
Thank you for sharing this system to us. I really enjoy this semi method so much. I also look your statement carefully in order to find out how to control the big loss when you are against the trend.  
  
From your statement: on Feb 02, you have big loss.

Here are my 2 questions:   
  
1\. Is it supposed to have 7 trades because the ST=300, PipStep=40 from 1.44435 drop to 1.41435? Why do you only have 6 trades?  
  
2\. When you got the 3rd trade SL, did you close the rest 3 trade manually or by EA itself? or at that moment you realized you jumped in the wrong trend?  
  
When one jumps in the trend wrong from the beginning,   
If he gets the #1 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 1260 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #2 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 1500 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #3 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 1700 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #4 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 1860 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #5 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 1980 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #6 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 2060 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
If he gets the #7 SL, he realizes he was wrong and close all the trades, then he will get 3500 pips of loss for 7 trades.  
  
So before you drive EA, you study the chart, analyze all the indications and MAs, the Loss still will happen. What's the best solution to avoid this, I am thinking of it. Any comments are welcomed.

My observation is G/U and E/U opened the most position, so I choose the two pair, But when I compare it between the two of them E/U daily chart is curly, thats what makes the daily trend a bit hard to predict, then look at the G/U daily chart, it gives u a nice and smooth trend and makes u easy to read the trend goes. Then u know what other pair to choose by visualy looking the daily chart.

Great Asamca_jason. I think u pay attention on the detail,..  
  
1\. The answer is I don't know why it happened like that asamca, I saw that too when it happened, and i've been wondering why just like u do now. That is happens quite often I guess, when my running position is let say -50pips it didnt opened another position yet, dont know why, maybe its about the code, or maybe the price moves really fast, but i dont know for sure.   
  
2\. I knew that if the price goes beyond some level, it might be a trend reversal just like I posted earlier, and when it happen on 2nd Feb i didnt drive the EA on purpose just to show u guys how danger it would be, But the price goes too far beyond my expectation, it closses 3 running position with -300pips each, I think that is enough to show u guys to be aware, then I close the rest opening position manually, then I didnt trade full day on the next day becouse I couldnt read where the trend will go, as u can see on the statement result, then when the trend is clear I jump again just like today.  
If I was running it on real acc I will close the running position even its negative before it becomes a nightmare, and jump to the street driving the EA again when the trend is clear.  
  
It is really important not to trade when u feel uncertain about where the daily trend will go.  
  
Yes I study the chart before I decided to run the EA,   
1\. read news, and another expert analisys  
2\. historical price action (I didnt have feeling on trading on 2nd Feb becouse when I saw the historical chart the price fell down so hard on monday from several weeks before, but my indis still show me an uptrend, that what makes me aware)  
3\. draw trend line (important to see support and resistance/psych level)  
4\. read the candle pattern  
5\. and of course my indis  
6\. my mood and my feeling about the trend, when im not in the mood and doubt about the direction i dont trade, even if i have to loose lots of pips.   
  
it seems like a long list but when u experience with it, it wont take too much time.

Guys like i told u the price goes to more than 1.48xxx, it tries to break the major resistence, need to be aware, if the major resistance (yellow line) hold it might go back down again but if it goes thru then we might see 1.5xxxx.

Hi Samurai Power,  
  
Thanx for the reply and suggestions.  
  
Our homework is really an important part for this system. Since 300pips of SL is so reliable as you mentioned, do you mind expressing how you control your trades when you have 4~5 orders? for example, you have 6 profit trades in Jan 21th. When EA opened so many trades, will you get fear because that means 200pips below your original trade? Will you still wait for the reversal or will abandon the trades when the price hit the first SL? It's common for retracement to have over 300pips, right? So what will you do?  
  
to my point of view,   
  
1\. We should have a big deposit.  
  
2\. Probably we should have MM to control the potential Loss. But still if the price hit the First SL, you will have 1260 pips loss.  
  
Sorry, all I concerned are the Losses. Knowing the Max real drawdown is the first thing when we trade EA in real account.  
  
Thanx again. Have a nice weekend.  
  
asamca

Great, its a very good detail question asamca.  
Fear of course, emotion plays important role, thats why i jump when the trend is clear and check it 1 or 2 times a day, but im not gonna jump if i sense something wrong, trade only 7 days a month or when it gives u a clear trend, then 5000 deposit is enough, but my suggestion is 0.1 lot for every 10000 balance. Experience of using this EA will answer most of nontechnical question, every people might have a different MM and setting, so just keep demo it for at least 3month, but if u guys are not sure with it just dont use it.  
I saw many people gives a different result using this EA, emotion really plays there. This is a semiauto EA, learn more if u like it and leave it if u dont.

Hey Samurai...  
  
Did you consider running FireBird on 1m chart...?  
Backtesting shows even more pips, I think it opens more trades.   
Will forward test next week on 1m.

I tried on 1 min chart gasgas, but it doesnt give me a different result.  
  
Back test 1 month period from 1 Aug 2008 to 31 Aug 2008.  
Setting:  
Direction : Short only  
TP : 100pips  
The rest setting is default  
  
On 5 Min chart : generate +3079 pips  
On 1 Min chart : generate +3078 pips  
  
I have no idea why your back test gives u different result.

hey mate,  
  
I see difference now.  
I was testing with 50 pips TP, and here we have different results.  
With 50pip TP, EA on 1m chart generates about 20% more profits than on 5min. For 100 pip TP, true, its the same.

Hi,  
  
i have created a version with CCI14, that is, just at the moment the trade is ordered, a check is made if the current daily cci(14) is above a certain threshold (parameterised) in case of a buy order, or below the same but negative threshold in case of a sell order. The cci is calculated with the "typical" price (H+L+C/3). I have also parameterised the averaging period (14) and found that it is best set at 4 instead of 14.  
  
I feel that CCI is also too late to pick trend changes in certain cases, e.g. 19th of Jan 2009 for GBP/USD.  
  
Try it for urself.

Sounds like a good upgrade of the EA, Fredella. I'll try it out next week.

Please note that this is not proven to be production worthy so ONLY try on demo accounts.  
  
The best results I have with ForexFlash's [Firebird_auto trend_(SMAperiod 1_Shift1_Median_Daily TF).mq4](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=200785&d=1233770366) in backtest from August 2008 till now on GBPUSD but it will only work with MAtype set to 1.  
  
I also noticed that the TradeOnFriday flag is not coded properly. I have fixed this in my version.  
  
All the best

Nice work, this is my back test.  
  
1 month back test period from Jan 1st 2009 to 31st Jan 2009  
  
Setting:  
Pair : G/U  
Direction : Long & Short (since this is a fully auto EA)  
TP : 100 pips  
SL : 200 pips  
The rest setting is default  
  
It managed to get +2594 pips in a month which is quite good for recognozing the trend reversal, I'll keep monitoring this.

Hi All,  
  
Update for semi auto EA, please look at the daily chart for G/U.  
  
Historical chart shows that every monday the price extreemly reverse, market emotion play dominant every monday, as i pointed on the pic.  
There is two reason why the price might tend do down tomorrow, becouse its monday and its becouse standing at the upper yellow line which is a major resistance, and there is no major news tomorrow, the market emotion will surely play its part.   
To up, if the upper yellow line is breaks then we will see an uptrend continuation, wich I will jump full armed (adding lot size to maximize profit) when its clear already.  
But in the other hand my indis still shows a good uptrend.  
This is almost the same situation on Feb 2nd, if that was a real acc, I surely not jumped, rather wait untill the trend is clear. But **** yea, that was a demo and its a good point to show u to be carefull.  
  
Those two aspect above is not in the line so that makes me to take a day off tomorrow until I see clearly the direction of the trend.  
  
  
Regards,  
Samurai Power

Hi Samurai Power.   
  
That's strange. I never got this result, far from it. Did you do this on 1M or   
5M or other TF.

Yes thats true fredella..  
  
When I test it for 2 month period from 1 Des 2008 to 31 Jan 2009 it generate +3,587pips.  
  
My setting...  
Deposit $10.000,   
SL : 200pips not 300pips  
TF : 5 Min  
Pair : G/U  
Direction : Long & Short (since this is a fully auto EA)  
TP : 100 pips  
The rest setting is default  
  
Check back the setting and try again Fredella and post the result ok...

Hi,  
  
I agree I must have had a setting wrong earlier. I now get 2496 from 01/01/2009 to 31/01/2009 and 3892 from 01/12/2008 till 31/01/2009 so almost in line with your results.   
  
But if you use 2000 TP and 4000 SL you get to 3395 in January although only 2582 when starting in December 08. Could it be something to do with the volatility of this currency pair?

Hi fredella can u make pistoldave idea as a trend recognizing tool for the EA, it seems like forexflash version is not working on my backtest, all of them are sell, non of them are buy. Look at the chart, it is very good on recognizing the trend reversal, or..maybe u can tune up forexflash version? thanks..

Hi Samurai and Fredella  
There is also the Slope Direction Line which is fine for the trend.  
Settings here: 7 , 3 , 0.  
If blue --> buy only  
If red --> short only  
Maybe Fredella can include different possibilities of choice of trend.  
Thx.

Hi, good time to start to learn programming ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I will try and integrate some of these ideas, maybe not today but some other time this week. I believe the problem with all these pictures is they provide a view after the event. E.g. the 19th of January was a big down day, however it started of positive. The indicators might well show an uptrend in the beginning of the day, and if you use daily indicators that take the Open value, you might be buying rather than selling. The other issue I found was that when you are backtesting the use of times and days becomes impossible. So for example not trading on fridays or on certain times of the day is not possible in backtest as the DayOfWeek() and TimeOfDay() functions return the current server day and time, not the one during the backtest. I'm thinking if for example only trading during the latter part of the day would be useful, to allow the daily trend to set in properly. However, can not see the effect of that in backtest.  
  
Fredella.

It's true these indicators look fine after events and in real can give false signals but what is important is to avoid that the EA continues to trade in the wrong direction.  
So we need to try different ways to improve the use of the EA.

Hi all,  
  
I am testing the last forexflash version and the fredella one  
  
but there is one question I would like to ask you:  
  
why when we see a clear long trade, a long daily candle  
  
these systems open short trade?  
  
maybe there is something I have to check.  
  
Until now the FF version is doing well, the fredella one is just stgarted and I will tell you how is going.  
  
only on eur/usd for me now  
  
thanks to everyone for efforts and contribution

Right Fredella,  
  
but even another issu for me:  
  
this morning, for example,  
your CCI was under 0 line, but the system starded long..  
  
maybe it was right, I don't know right now..but this is osmething strange, no?  
  
how are going your trades?

Hi, please note that the CCI check is based on daily CCI, not 5M e.g. Which currency pair are you looking at and can you send a screenshot. I will have time to look at this later tonight if you can send me as many details as possible.

I had a little update by phone  
  
both fredella version and FF are doing well today  
  
but the FF one open and closed one in short correctly  
  
the fredella one ha still one long running,  
  
maybe it will hit the target, but when it started the daily trend was short,  
and in case it would have been set to short instead of long it would be another great trade  
  
  
as soon as I get results I will tel you  
  
  
nobody else is experiencing these EA?  
  
I see a lot of value in this system anyway, thanks again

I have my version running on GBP/USD since last night. This morning I saw 3 long trades being opened overnight whilst the market was declining.   
  
Since then the GBP has been rising steadily and I'm convinced these trades will now have closed with 100 pips each, but I will check later ...

Hi Fredella fren,  
  
How much pips u got today? I see the chart is in an uptrend continuation.  
  
OK....update for semiauto...  
  
From the daily shart I see the price break the major resistance (upper yellow line), it means the uptrend is still intach. I'm gonna drive my EA long for tomorrow, the price might try to test again the yellow line or arround the orange line (on 1H chart) for retracement but I assume it wont be more than 300pips down which is good for the EA to spot the good entry setups.

The price is buliding volume on 1H chart, we might see the retracement for 100 - 150 pips down and then up again try to reach the upper blue line again.  
  
Next daily candle...  
If the orange line (or max to lower blue line) on 1H chart holds, we might reach 1.5132 level tomorrow.

use 2 for shorts only

I have read FAQ and yr first post, but "Drive" as i get it is only to allow EA to trade and not to allow EA to trade in certain time ????  
  
Well I will look at it again, maybe I am missing something

Hi S-Power!  
  
Sorry, but I have re-read the FAQ and post #1, and I still don't see a clear answer. Could you please tell me if you 'drive' the EA long or short after the HA candle has closed to confirm the trend?  
  
For instance, you get a down arrow (sell signal), do you wait for the HA candle to close red before 'driving' the EA short only (at the open of the next candle)?   
  
Also, did you change the MA_timeframe, length, or type?   
  
Thanks!

Not an easy task to fully automatize EA, you need yr EA to recognise Up, Down trend and of course most important congestion time.  
  
I am trying to do that also ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1))))

Yes bnbb2004,if I sense something wrong (my template, candle pattern, trend line, S/R line, news, doesn't in line,) I usually off for that day and continue to jump driving the EA again after the HA closed to make sure that I'm in the right direction.

Yes, thats the major things that our friends here are trying to. I can say I can got for about 2000pips average in a month with this manual system with less stress and no time consuming, but some of our friends try to make it easier by trying to automatisize this manual drive thing.   
  
U said its not easy to fully automated the EA, me...? im gonna need 5 years to do that ha...ha..  
  
By the way, am I spelling "automatisize" correctly?

Hi, the 3 trades that were placed overnight indeed all closed with 100pips each so 300 pips. At 16:40 GMT it then opened a further long trade at 1.4913 which is still open.

Thanks Fredella. What version of the EA are you using? I'm using the Firebird v63G trader seven version on the 5m chart. Right now I have it set at long only and it hasn't taken any trades yet.  
  
Thanks for the help

Hi, I'm using the version I posted earlier with the CCI extension, which today should cause identical results as a normal v63G trader seven version as the CCI was positive.   
  
Could you have lost internet connection for a while or something?

Thanks Fredella and Samurai. The GU just opened a long trade a little while ago. I'm not sure why it didn't open any before, but as long as it's working now, that's all that matters to me.

Hi Samurai,  
  
Thank you for opening this thread.  
  
And thanks everyboby for your time and effort trying to make this EA fully automatic EA.  
  
Please I use Firebird v63G trader seven. but this ea does not open long orders when set to long only. When set to short only, or long and short, it opens only sell orders only.   
All these long run on GBP/USD, no long trade was place. Only sell orders. [aganist the trend].  
  
Pease Samurai, Kindly attach again this your Semi automatic ea that you use to get these nice results manually.  
Maybe that helps me to drive the ea along with the trend on one direction.   
  
Thanks,  
markpips.

I'm gonna drive my EA long for tomorrow, the price might try to test again the yellow line or arround the orange line (on 1H chart) for retracement but I assume it wont be more than 300pips down which is good for the EA to spot the good entry setups.

hi all,  
  
the results so far for this night:  
  
the fredella one, 1 closed in positive, big losses on the open trades.  
  
the ForexFlash one, 3 closed positive, half losses of the fredella one in the open trades.  
  
The V2 5m one, 3 closed positive, the minus losses of the three.  
  
Pairs: eur/usd - gbp/usd  
take profit: 50  
  
From tomorrow I will test the funyoo version.  
  
  
I can't say which one is the best, some suggestion from you?  
how are going your tests?  
  
do you think 100 tp is best than 50 tp?  
  
thanks to all,  
cheers

I attached indicator which automatically drawn trend lines, I find it useful, no need to draw them manually.  
If anybody wants it...oh and little red circle shows, where line had been broken.

Hi,  
  
I guess my long trades will have closed with a loss by now. I had TP@100 and SL@200 on G/U.  
  
I'm thinking if it is wise to change the CCI version to not use the current level of CCI(4), but measure the change so if the change is negative, i.e. CCI becomes smaller, but CCI is still positive, we're going back to zero and hence the upward trend is disappearing and we should stop opening long trades.  
  
What do u think?  
  
Fredella

Hey Guys, just wanted to confirm how you tell Long Trend or Short Trend.   
  
Long trend = Up Arrow lower than the yellow and green lines and candle is White?   
  
Short trend = Down Arrow above the yellow and green lines and candle is Red?   
  
Is this correct? or as long as the colour of the candle is Red or White, is all I have to worry about? Thank you

hello friend,  
  
Well basically I want only concentrate on one pair Gbp/Usd. yesterday a went one trade long for 50 pips, but then price hits upper channel line (possible retrace), so I shut down EA. Price went 500pips down till now. So if I would stay with 'Long', I would have preaty bad day today.   
We must be carful for days like this...See picture, this indi. can give you heads up, when is wise to take a break and get out from trades in time.

hi,  
terrible day yesterday and this night, many lossess all around.  
  
Fredella touch 4 times the stop loss, just one winning trade  
  
Forexflash also took the stop loss, but much more winning trades  
  
The old V2 5m is the best until now, all the trades closed in positive  
but the problem is that open only short, in a long day I think could hurt you  
  
  
I think we need to tweak something, the system is very good however  
  
cheers.

Hi,  
  
I agree that yesterday clearly showed the automatic approach isn't working. I think the sudden trend reversal has done major damage and only manual setting helps. Even then you could have chosen to go long as I believe SamuraiPower did. I will leave the EA running to see if it will recover throughout this week, but am going to think about solutions to this as well.

Fredella,  
  
you are the magician of the EA  
  
I am sure you could find the way  
  
for example, what about implementing the channel indicator posted by gasgas?  
  
Do you think this could be done?  
  
the problem is to change during the day,  
I think it could be done  
  
maybe just an MA could do that..  
  
  
Look at the V2 5m version, this works great  
the only thinks is that opens only short  
once we solve that we can say it is a big advance  
  
thanks for your efforts, I hope many suggestions are coming

And trying to operate on 1m chart but with the channel on 15m or 1h?  
  
Take profit 20 or something like that  
  
  
we can work on many settings, I can help with tests, not on coding sorry

Consider this two lines as support/resistance, so price ''might'' bounce from it and change direction. But be aware, after line is broken, in next bar, channel will extend. Place it on 1h and 4h charts, and watch how price reacts after broke the channel line.

Hi all,  
  
Yesterday was quite a heavy day, i'll try to add 4H chart as a manual trend recognition, hopefully I will always have time (not busy) when the time to control the chart.

Hello Samurai,  
  
the point is really this, the time to watch the chart  
  
I think we are very close to a very very good fully automated EA  
  
Do you have any suggestion to improve the existing ones?

Hi,  
  
whilst we're going to think about ways to improve, i have here attached a version that seems an improvement to the current CCI one, in that it checks that the CCI is in a trending state, i.e. not retracting back to zero. Try it out and let me know. It will do far less trading then the previous one but it should be more successful. I tried it on G/U and since January 1st it would just hit one SL out of 30 trades. For different currencies you might need to alter the settings.  
  
The other positive note is that backtesting seems very identical to demo trading when i look at the trades the CCI system entered into and when i then compare it to the results of the back test. The only drawback of backtesting remains the issue that you can not do anything with days and times as noted previously.  
  
As always: do not use this EA on a live account.

Hi Fredella fren,  
  
I do really know how powerfull this EA on catching alot of pips,a good trend recognition tools for this EA can make it 95% perfect, for me there will be a drawdown, but if statistic result said 1 loss for every 30 trading time is more than enough for me, i'll test it hopefully we can upgrade from manual to auto in just a few step ahead. Thx fredella fren.

yes,  
  
it would be very good..  
  
I am testing this new version Fredella,I will let you know  
  
  
otherwise I would like to remark the best results I am having is with the old V2 5m, no loosing trade this week.  
  
The only thing I am thinking is what happen if there is a long day, it opens only short  
  
does anyone have tested it in a long day?  
can someone try to backtest it (I am not able to)?  
  
  
thanks to everyone

Hi, is the ForexFlash one you are referering to as V2 5m? If so in my view there is a bug which causes this behaviour. I can run a back test on this one later.

Yes Fredella,  
  
thanks for your interest.  
  
this version in this weekend doesn't closed negative trades, in all conditions,  
meaningwhile collecting more positive trades than every other version.  
  
I remember you checked the bug before, but I think that if we can solve this issue this version is a good starting point.  
  
  
I have also to say the last you posted is the first day of usage, so I can't tell how is going.  
  
  
thanks,

hi all,  
  
just to add some numbers to my consideration about the V2 5m version.  
  
until now in this week it has been collecting 2300 pips  
with take profit 50 pips on eur/usd and gbp/usd.  
  
the other systems are not comparable with this.  
  
today could be a good test, because we know it is not working on long trend.  
  
I know that if we can solve the issue about the only short trade we would not collect so many pips and see some losses, but at the end of the week I think it would be positive after all with this numbers.  
  
I hope we will improve it, very profitable until now.

Hi oipoipoi,  
  
could you share with us the actual details of the pips gained, i can then check in backtest what has happened. Could you also post your settings of the EA so that results are going to be identical.  
  
thanks,

Hi Fredella,  
  
no problem at all, excep for when.  
  
Until tomorrow I am out, and only in the week end I will send you the results.  
  
But not for settings,  
they are the same as the last posted by ForexFlash (corrected from the first which had some bugs)  
corrected only for a 4 digit broker.  
  
I let it run together with the others from sunday night.  
  
  
I hope it helps, it is very impressing to see all these green lines in the account window..  
  
but, I repeat, it is only short,  
working properly I know there would have been some trade opened in long and closed in losses.

Hi,  
  
this morning came here to share my data with you and I find 3 of 4 sistems with lost memory, the only one that still remains is the last one you posted fredella.  
  
wow,  
I hope this won't stop you.  
Anyway I have some pics from the week's operation and I have signed the economics about that.  
  
Before the yesterday's pic the system collected more than 2000 pips.  
  
Yesterday, as expected, the system collected losses, but at the end of the week I think it is still profitable.  
  
I hope this could help to solve..  
Samurai, how is gone this week for you?  
  
  
Let me know what do you think fredella, hope it helps

Yes iopoipoi fren, sory I was very busy last week, but I still watch the update, didn't pay attention to much bout my demo platform.  
  
Key, just want to give a note about last week demo semi auto EA result .  
Last week my prediction was wrong I was trying to collect as many pips as posible and I was trading in the midle of uncertain direction (the candle didn't break the major resistance clearly yet), need to pay attention on several things that I was actually mentioned.  
  
1\. Don't overtrade, just take 7 days trading a month on a very clear trend, 7 days trading with larger lot size riding the trend is much better than every day trading with normal lot size but risking my account on trend reversal.   
  
2\. Need to pay attention more on a smaller TF (4H chart) to see deeper about what the price is doing.  
  
Bout the fully auto EA I think we still need to tune it up.   
  
....Fredella fren, I am trying to study EA programing, I download some simple article bout EA programing, can u share me some good article about EA programing?

Hi samurai  
Yes I'm thinking 1H and 4H TF are better to take the good direction.  
With your EA, daily TF is too big TF in my opinion.  
Last week, I got excellent results only during London session and your basic EA following only the 4 H trend ( 10 % profit with 5 pairs ).

Hi, have you read this: <http://www.metatrader.info/node/34>  
  
I am learning from there day by day. The Programming Discussion forum is also great for tips and tricks. You can always PM me if you get stuck on something, I might be able to help.  
  
I just wish i had more time to work on this. This week i will run the CCI v2 version on GBPUSD and EURUSD. Both have shown very good results in backtest over January.

yes madscalp fren, i set daily trend just becouse i dont have much time to check it regularly, but for others might be more usefull using 1H and 4H.   
10%profit is good for a week trading. Was it real acc?  
btw thx for the idea.

Hi, the EA that only sells seems to be doing rather well in backtest. I have posted the backtest for EURUSD from 4th of feb till today as well as the results from the corrected version. The bug one is by far better !!!

true,  
  
any way to improve it?  
  
Fredella, I think that trying to add something to this it would be very very good  
  
  
Also I think we have to move to another way of reading the trend..maybe a shorter timeframe would be useful

Here you go mate,  
Generat idea was: Buy at bold green, Sell at bold Red, but be carfull, price can and will violate those lines. Direction of lines shows trend direction.   
Apply on chart and ebserve whats going on, hope you will find it useful, but can't give you more pointers couse didn't use this system at all, so I have to learn to.

Hi Fredella fren,  
  
Well actually I dont know exactly what is, maybe gasgas fren can explain it in detail, but I do know like this, let me give an example about haiken ashi indicator (becouse i think it's happen to many indis):  
My daily chart setting on HA is down when u see red, and up when u see white, so when u see a down move the color is red, but sometimes the price moves up and the red color turns white at the spesific day, so when u enter the market when u see red color, and then the price is up and turns white it means u enter in a wrong direction.  
Others might have a better explanation.

I agree this method is not perfect and 3 repaints until reversal trend.  
If it was perfect, we would follow up-3,down-3,up-3,....making a lot of money without using EA .  
But I noticed when up-3 is fixed and pink star appears, it's generally a downtrend and when down-3 is fixed and yellow star appears, it's generally a uptrend.  
As I said it, I'm trading only London session.  
Before, I used the pivots-resistance-support with unpredictable results but now I'm using that.  
So at London open, I'm checking if 4H trend and 1H trend are in agrement for each pair and then I put "only long" or "only short".   
Sometimes, I change the direction during the session if there is a big reversal trend after news for example.  
It's important to avoid a dangerous reversal trend and this method is just a tool to protect the EA ....no more.  
Just my thought.

We can also use 3 TF in agrement to determine the trend: daily, 4 H and 1 H but there will always be unforeseen events unfortunately to annoy us....

How long the EA didnt open trade? sometimes (but rarely) the EA dont trade, but if it dont trade for 2 days it means there is something wrong  
  
Have u adjust it to your broker paltform?   
Did u turn the ea button on?  
did u set the EA to "Allow live trading"?  
read the word document attached on 1st post, it might help u a lot, its only few pages.

Madscalp,  
  
I observed the indis u provided on 1 min chart to see how this indis behaviour in a blink of an eye and analized weather it will give a bad effect to the EA or not. And yes i think there is something that annoy me. I found that the "3" signal wasnt fix staying in the spesific candle after it showed in the first time, even if the candle has closed several times the "3" signal can still move, we might get the wrong trend![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1).

Look at the circle I've drawn.  
  
The Arrow and HA is in the line, it shows that the next daily candle is clearly predictable, that's when the high probability comes.

Hi, am still using it, and yesterday it made 100 pips on EUR/USD. I agree at times it is very quiet, it needs to have the CCI in the right situation before it does try.  
  
did you have it switched on EUR/USD yesterday?

Yes, that is general problem rapainting indicators, but on higher time frames that shouldn be so much problem, they usually lag less on 4h and daily. Today Gbp/Usd went down to fib line (50), ''3'' signal forms and price bounc back up. I gain 100pips trading long, +30pip still open.   
Well...but still a lot to learn!! Just abserving at the moment how this indis.can or can't be usefull.

Yep pips stunner, the EA wont work if u turn your comp off, so use vps to attach the EA to make it running continuously no matter your comp off or on.

Got some insight news that the price wont break the 1.4000 level yesterday, so I entered long yesterday with consideration if the price bounce back up from 1.4000 level it wont hit the stoplos. Just managed to get only 200pips today.

well uhmm thanks, but u have to know the risk of this system and know how to use it, keep demo it so u got this system well understand, just trade only when the arrow and the HA indicator is line, coz that is when the high probability comes, i,m gonna trade this live only when those indis is in line, maybe about 2 or 3 times a month but with larger lot size.  
VPS means virtual private server, its act as your seccond computer but on the server with a very good up time internet connection, so u can attach this EA and not to worry turning off your comp coz u have back up computer on server.  
  
Btw I still took long since yesterday and just got 100pips and 40pips on running position.

Heya Samurai fren, I see you doing very good, thats great![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1), so basically, your new filter is: Drive only if arrow and HA agree in direction on daily, is that correct?  
Thanks,

hi,  
you got nice distription on post #401, its a service where you can put your traiding platform +EA on and have 24 hours internet connection no matter if your PC is on or off. Expert needs internet connection, so it wont work on your MT4 on your comp.,if you shut it down. This VPS service cost usually around 15-30$ per month, but can be very usefull if you got bad connection.  
  
Hope that helps a bit.

Yups gasgas fren, I think its quite important to trade when the probability is high, I'm gonna trade this live only when those indis in line with double lots, 2 or three times a month is enough I guess, less stress and avoiding the drawdown.

Hi all,  
  
Look at the daily chart, the green circle i've drawn is when the HA and the arrow is in the line, then u can guess where the price goes in the next day (look at the white line I've drawn), that where the high probability is, if the probability is high, then I can calculate like this. (just for example..)  
  
Deposit : $10.000  
Lot size : standard lot, 1pip=$10  
Trading frequency/month : 2-3 times  
Profit/trade : 200pips  
profit/month : 400-600 pips ($4000-$6000)  
Growth/month : 40%-60%  
  
U can calculate much safer money management on your own..

I see the HA color on EURGBP yesterday candle is red, yes I see the up arrow (again), but those two indis are not in line, so its too risky for me, but I see now the EURGBP price is up, u might get good pips, but still "risky" good pips for me..  
  
Keep demo it

Hi Correy,  
  
I usually check it when I wake up at 6-7am (my time is GMT +7), when im about to get a shower taking my pda to the bathroom ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1), coz the price is relatively quiet arround that time, but the point is u can check it as soon as the daily candle closed, so u can analyze the indis.

The setup was perfect, yesterday candle shows the arrow pointing up and the HA color is white, those yesterday indis is in the line and today was the perfect day to drive the EA long.  
  
The market range for today from 1.4151 to 1.4480 it means 329 pips range, but I managed to get +400pips (more than the market range).  
  
So if we trade only when the high probability comes, it means minimum risk and i think we can use 0.1 lot for each $2000 deposit.

I noticed the candle closes at 00:00 GMT (19:00 my time) on my IBFX MetaTrader platform so I should check the daily chart about that time each day and turn on the EA if the indicators "line up"?   
  
Do you leave the EA on until the chart shows a possible direction change?  
  
  
Thanks!

Most of time yes, but as long as the price moves within a chanel in 4H chart trendline, if it breaks it means i have to close all running position and wait till the next signal for antry.

Oh okay....so you use a 4H chart as well as a daily. Do you attach any indicators to the 4H chart?

Hi Samurai, when I look at daily G/U now I do not get the last white arrow. Do you see the same and any reason why that would be the case. I like your idea and will see if an EA can be written.

Maybe Samurai's MT4 server is in different time zone with yours, which means the open/close price are not the same as yours, or something like that.

Hey Fredella,  
  
I think you should get white arrow, do you use same indi.Samurai posted?  
Or just put 2 ema's on chart. First: Period 1, close. Second: Period 2, close.   
They shouls cross 2 bars back. That would mean, next bar after cross arrow should appear.

That makes sense. Unfortunately makes it also a bit more difficult to compare results. I seem to have the arrow always in line with HA. Maybe because i'm living in the GMT0 timezone. Thanks for your views ...

But i recomend trade only for the spesific day only when yesterday candle shows the indis is in line, maybe about 2-3 times a month, coz thats avoiding the drawdown u might not afford to lose, if u prefer to continue trade untill the posible direction change thats your own choise, but please demo it so u can really understand the risk and know how to handle it.

I use trendline, if there is posibility for the price to break the trendline then i have to close all running position, turn the the EA off and wait till next signal for entry. Demo it for about a week or two so u can feel if u trade against the trend.

Yesterday candle on eurgbp shows that the indis are not in line (green circle on the chart), the HA color is red (down) but the arrow is up (no wonder it repaints), but sometimes the arrow gives a very good sign than HA, u are lucky the price went up, u must have been catching a "risky" good pips yesterday.

Hey S-power,  
  
that is really simple and very good idea. Acourding backtesting: trade when arrow and HA agree and close all positions after 24hours, almost all days seems to be profitable, just a few negativ for few pips (5-15pips).   
Will do more tests on more pairs today.  
Oh..and positions shouldn't be keept threw weekend, weard stuff going on then, and price likes to turn on Mondays.  
  
BTW, what is your monthly fee for VPS? I'm thinking geting that service to.  
Thanks fren, and wish you a nice weekend.

Hi gasgas, looks indeed with setting EMA 3 close and EMA 7 close we get a similar result as with the arrows and HA. If these cross over, wait 2 days and then trade. The day in between is when the arrow will appear. Will set this up, hopefully this weekend. Have a great one and i think we should all thank Samurai Power for his amazing insight.

Yes gasgas fren, im thinking about trading multiple pair, but trade only when the indis confirmed, so I can trade more than 3 times a month with all of them high probability entry setup.  
im using vpsland.com taking ez lite plan for $18 a month, the cheapest one but quite accomodate my needs attaching my EA.

Hi all,  
  
I've been back testing it for 8 pairs  
GBPUSD, EURUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDJPY, EURGBP, USDCHF, AUDUSD  
  
The condition is:  
yesterday daily candle shows that the indis is in line between the arrow and the HA (High probability), and trade on the next daily candle for 24 hours only to avoid drawdown.  
Back test for only 1 month period of Jan 2009 (back test it for longer time if u would like to)  
Deposit : $1000   
Lot size : 0.1  
(0.1lot for every $1000 deposit), I recomend 0.1lot for every $5000 deposit  
TP : 100pips  
the rest setting is default  
  
The result is  
The most tradable pair:GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDCAD, NZDUSD, USDCHF  
Total net profit : 1716pips ($1716)  
Max drawdown : -274pips ($-274) or equal -27.4% compare to deposit  
Growth : 170% in a month  
  
Learn the excel analisys i attached, compare it to plain daily candle and my daily candle template.  
  
If its manage to keep grow 150%/month, u can turn $1000 to a million in 9 month (I hope)  
  
gasgas fren, i need your comment..  
  
Regards,  
Samurai Power

Hi all,  
  
Thanks to Samurai for sharing this method and also for his continuing efforts to improve it.   
  
I have downloaded and installed the files from the first page. When compiling the EA, I observe certain messages. I know that the nature of the message is such that the EA will still work, but I was just wondering whether I have the latest EA presently in use. Also whether the relevant functions that are being removed during compilation are importan to the proper functioning of the EA. The EA that I am using is :Firebird v63G trader seven.  
  
The messages being received during compilation are:  
Function "CloseTheseTrades" is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file  
  
Function "CloseLoosingTrades"is not referenced and will be removed from exp-file  
  
Similar messages for hree more functions.

Hi,  
  
I wonder about trading on Sunday and Monday. If the trend is clear on Sunday night, that is if the last signal was clear, should I trade even though the weekend was in between? The same goes for Monday, should I trade on Monday if the trend from Sunday is clear, since Sunday is not a full trading day. All of this of course if there is a clear trend.  
  
Regards

Yes TradeForexFx, i'm using the EA i attached on the first post, never changed it till now. I was having the same experience when the first time I analyse this EA and tried to compile it, I found several error message when i was compiling it, all I know the EA work properly and i think there is no bad effect, and i'm really stupid about programming.

Yes Archie, I am thinking about that too, when i'm looking at the chart and analize it, sometimes the indis gives a good clear trend signal even weekend is in between, but I have no good feeling about trading on monday, coz the trend reversing extreemly quite often, but anyway let's analize it together when its come again ok..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Im thinking since we are gonna trade in a high probability entry setup, we need to reduce stoploss to 200pips, based on my experience it still accomodate the price ranging movement on clear trend, still analizing it....

Hi, my signals are sometimes on different days, but still getting positive results. This means we could probably use this thread as a reporting system for when we are entering positive conditions?   
  
I assume your backtesting was done by setting start day equal to signal day and end day to the day after, meaning trades would close out at 23:59 on that same day?  
  
Thanks,  
Fredella

yes I enter position when yesterday daily candle is in line, then i close all position 24 hours later at 23:59.  
i was doing manual backtest for each spesific day, so its quite time consuming, now im trying to back test it from juli 08 for each pair. i'll post the result as soon as i finish.

Hi,  
  
I have thought about how the Firebird EA works and I haven't found any information about it. When does it trigger trades? What kind of indicators does it use?

Thanks, I didn't think about that. Always good to know how the EA trades.  
  
Have you experienced any problems with this EA, error trades and so on?  
  
I'm thinking about the stop loss, how often is it hit? I used the EA without your system a couple of months ago and it was really profitable, but then it hit the SL a couple of times, most likely because the market started ranging, so that would be avoided with your approach. But still I wonder about the SL and when trades go bad. How is your experience with worst case scenarios?  
  
Thanks for your system. Great that someone took the time to use a different approach for this great EA.  
  
Regards  
  
Archie

Hey mate, sorry for my late replay, I'm extremely busy this weekend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
So I did some tests on randomly chosen month (April 2008).  
Start EA when HA and arrow in line and close all opens after 24 hours.  
One thing, I test on 1m chart, as I think it can somethimes opens more positions, need more test. And I DID NOT trade on Monday, if Fridays arrow and HA in line, couse I think that could lead on much bigger drawdown, so I won't recoment you to trade Mondays. It really is best to take only signals that looks OK.  
T/p = 100pips  
Resoults:  
  
Eur/Usd: -10,+200  
Eur/Gbp: +30  
Eur/Jpy: +20,+80  
Gbp/Usd: +210  
Gbp/Jpy: +100  
Usd/Jpy: +40,+100  
  
So Samurai fren, I can back you up here, this really looks promising. Mabey I will play a little more with diferent T/P, and consider S/L 200, it should really be enough here I think.  
  
Thanks,

I am new in this thread but I think this method could be very sucessful. I modified the EA to automate the entry following samurai Power settings, the indicator and HA in line. I hope works for you guys. i will test it on my computer and will let you know of the results. The EA show in the screen when is only buy, only sell or not trade base in the daily chart. I didn't include not trade on mondays, but can be fixed.

Hi xchaparo,  
  
I am sure that this improvement will be most useful.   
  
Apparently the EA does not have magic number. Therefore it will hamper and be hampered by other manual trades on the same account. While you are at it, if you could also look into this aspect and perhaps introduce magic number so that manual trades and trades by other EAs on the sme account does not hamper trades by this EA.  
  
Your efforts are much appreciated.  
  
Thanks

Hi once again,  
  
After reviewing the source for the EA, I realized that it does have magic number aspect, but in a somewhat different way. As long as it is there and it works.  
  
I would suggest that there be a choice in the EA to allow us to select to trade either using the requirements of the system or even otherwise.

Hi,  
  
Great work with the EA. I wonder on what TF the EA should be placed. The original EA trades at 5M, but the trend is given on the daily TF, so what TF for this combined EA?  
  
Regards  
  
Archie

Instead of taking just one day trade per setup, what do you think about reducing the lot size each new day as long as the trend is still on. I mean if you start to trade with 10% equity on the day after the two indicators align, then on the next day, reduce the lot to 8% equity, then the third day if the trend is still on, reduce the lot size to 6% equity and so on. What do you think. I think it will reduce the risk of being in full lots when the trend begins to change and at the same time allow you to follow the trend through. Just my suggestion.

Yep, thats why I drive the EA, coz this EA is very weak on recognizing the trend, yet very powerfull digging pips (as long as u follow major trend).  
Yes i managed to get several thousand pips per month with drawdawn include in it, but lots of people keep asking about the 300SL, but what i think it still save coz i drive the ea manually, but deposit has to be at least $10.000 for 0.1/trade coz u have to accomodate the drawdown that may occur.  
But compare if we trade at high probability setup, drawdown is minimize, let me give u example.  
  
_Following the trend_   
keep the EA on till posibility of trend changing, it means u trade almost every day and worrying about your position since u cant read the trend, its equal stress every day, and u cant trade multiple pair coz it quite hectic and too dangerous, and the most important thing is most traders dont have life becoz they spending lots of time in front of computer, and your wife angry at u (mhmm thats me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f910.png?v=15.1)..).   
So hey trader people have a life!!!!!  
  
let say 0.1 for $10.000 (the safest formula)  
with this trading style I can managed 2000-3000pips/month average  
U will say: "wowwww 2000pips/month, u are awasome....."  
but if u convert to dollar, it's only $2000, it means only 20% growth compare to deposit.  
"but what if i add the lot size to 0.5 lot for every $10.000, that will increase the profit?"  
well...all i can say is there is only few people can do it.   
  
_Trade when its high probability_  
It means minimize drawdown, confidence for taking 1 lot for every $10.000, less stress coz u only trade for let say 7 days per month, u can trade multiple pair and all of them is high probablility, no emotion attached when u trade. U can have your own life and enjoy it.  
  
Ok let say 1 lot for every $10.000  
trade 5 pair, and each pair gives u just 200pips a month.  
it means 1000pips only but its worth $10.000, 100% growth/month.  
well now i can say this as a "wow..."  
  
hope it'll help a little..

I have done some tests on live account also, and saw that resoults can be deferent from demo account, please everybody be aware of that!! Sometimes can be even better, sometimes worst.  
  
Samurai mate, what about repainting issue with arrows, what do you think, do they repaints and if they are, how often?

No no, I didn't trade, just backtesting on live account. Im looking on 8pairs and none didn't in line yesterday, even if one were, I wouldn't trade it, couse its Monday.   
I'm just thinking if arrows can repaint, never watched them closely. What do you think fren?

Ooo i see that..  
  
ok based on my experience, if the arrow and the HA is in line, its rarely to repaint, but if its not in line, one of the indis (the arrow or the HA) repaints quite often, that can make your heart bouncing.

Hi Samurai,  
  
I also tested the v2 EA yesterday, and found that some trades were loss because of this situation: with the 2 signals approved, the EA open several trades. the last one was almost openned at the end of the day and went loss 1 or 2 days later. That means not all of the trades were closed at the trading day. Did you find this happened in your back test, Samurai? I think the EA should close all the trades at the end of Trading day no matter win or loss trades.  
  
Regards.

Negative running position is normal coz the EA taking position on retracement, the market will recover your position when the probability is high, just make sure the indis is in line, all i know if u trade in a high probability setup the loss will reduce, never more than 150pips after u close it in the next 24hours.

Did u mean **xchaparro** fully auto EA?  
Im backtesting **xchaparro** fully auto EA now, it seems accomodate my idea, if yesterday candle approved, the **xchaparro** EA should've been open in the right direction coz its based on the arrow and the HA indis. And yes the EA dont close the trade in the next 24 hours, maybe **xchaparro** will fix it soon.  
Im trying different setting for the arrow indicator so that the EA can open more trades, with setting fasterEMA: 5 and slowerEMA:8 on the arrow indis, the EA dont open position quite often but its profitable, now im trying different setting. I'll let u know then..

I think the indicator repaints, so sometimes will affect the result. I am working adding a extra indicator that doesn't repaint.

I added the option to no trade on Monday. I also added this indicator HMA hull, H4 to prevent to open trades when the trend change. You can choose "UseHMA" or not. I was running EURUSD today and the trend changed, even when the arrow and HA were in line at the begining. I refreshed the D1 chart and the indicator repainted. The EA will keep trading because it refresh the values once a day for the arrows. Samurai let me know if this work for your idea. Also do you want to close all the trades the next day, even if they are in profits? The EA won't open any trades until the next arrow appear. What about losing trades? do you close them at the end of the day or wait for retrace or stop loss

I keep getting the "excessive loss" alert, like every few seconds. How do I turn this off, and more importantly, why is it happening?  
  
Please someone help! The alerts are driving me crazy!! I get the alert sound every few seconds!

Well...I still didn't gave up upon this EA. Strategy we try to use with arrows had some issues and now I'm helping with other indicators to determine if play a game for that day or not. I'm sure, a good combination+price action will give resoults.  
  
T/p = 35pips  
  
Gbp/Usd +175pips for today

The point of this EA to be max. succesfull is when market is ranging, and will be less succesfull if price goes straith one way. Good example is this chart from today.

Not sure where to post this, so hope someone sees it and helps me out here.   
  
Or points me in the right direction.  
  
Just one simple question regarding EA's;  
  
If I install an EA on a [Broker](http://www.forexfactory.com/brokers.php)'s system and the robot begins to initiate trades, is there a way the broker can distinguish whether the trade is executed by a robot or human??  
  
If so, Please explain.  
  
If not, Great!!!   
  
Any help in this matter is greatly appreciated!!!!!!  
  
Pippdaddy, OUT!

Hey Daddy ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Short answer ''YES'' , broker can see EA is placing trades, but most of them will allow that kind of trading, but be aware that every EA don't work with all brokers. If you got scalping EA, many brokers will reject it. And of its to succesfull, they can reject it to, for any stupid reason they can find.  
Hope thats help a little.

Hi all,  
  
I added an MM(Money Management) function to xchaparro's EA(Firebird v63G trader seven3.mq4) to see if we can maximize profits.  
  
HMA Modified.mq4 file is the same as post [#470](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2558690&postcount=470). But I will just post them together for convenience sake.

I was running EURUSD today and the trend changed, even when the arrow and HA were in line at the begining. I refreshed the D1 chart and the indicator repainted. The EA will keep trading because it refresh the values once a day for the arrows. Samurai let me know if this work for your idea.

Hi Xchaparro  
  
Thanks for your work on this. Does the HMA indicator need to be placed on the same chart as EA for this to work?

Hi All,  
  
Thanks for your work and contributions on this EA and system. There are a couple of versions floating around which one has proven the most reliable on a live account?  
  
I tried to Demo them Money Management Version but it would not place any trades continues to say MaxOrdersOpen=0 Anyone else have similar or different results?  
  
Thanks

Hey Samurai  
  
I noticed throughout this thread you have tested different indicators to supplement your method. Just curious at this point are you sticking with your original simple method of D1 with HA and EMA cross or have you adjusted it? Also are you still using original FB 63G trader seven EA version?  
  
Thanks,

Hi guys,  
  
First of all I would like to apologize for dissapearing lately, I'm setting up a small company so it drains my energy, no space at all in my brain to answer this thread, was checking this thread several times and seems not much sound.  
Well.. overall we still have to find a way to minimize the risk since we know that we can dig lots of green pips with this system, there's gonna be losses of course, but still profit cumulatively in the end of the month.  
I'm trading this live (using my semi auto style) but only when I'm sure of the direction coz for me trading is a side job, getting 500pips for $1/pip is enough for me.  
I'm sugessting dont trade it live yet, I do really know how this system can gain lots of pips, but i do really know also the drawdown that may accour, just wait untill we find a good risk management, meanwhile just take this thread as a comfort place to discuss. But if u insist, then u need $10,000 minimum deposit (its a must).

In my opinion, xchaparro EA is suitable for me, it allow us to make the EA open more trades by setting MA on the 5-8open (indicator), and we can control not to open trade when its against 4H chart, but i dont find best setting yet.  
  
im thinking about the result if this fully auto EA to open trade continuously until the HA or arrow changed, and make it as an option wether trade only for the next 24 hours or continuously, hope xchaparro read this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
But one thing for sure I do really agree with this..

Welcome back Samurai,  
Yes, it was more or less quiet since you been away, I'm glad your back.   
Well, I also thinking all cainds of crap to get this work better. I was running ea on flat market to, with long&short and it gave pretty good resoults, so we can take advantage also on ranging market. But as you, I still search for good combination of ideas about timing. Will get my self VPS this week, couse I got some problems with inter.connection lately.  
BTW, wish you much success with company buddy![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thx gasgas fren.  
Yes i was having trouble also with net connection and not only that, i couldnt run my EA while im working, so VPS is a very good solution, providing u 99% up time connection, and im just using my PDA only to see the chart update, very simple and mobile. Im using VPSland.com, took the cheapest one, only $17/month. if anyone having trouble with net connection I suggest u use this fascility.

Hi guys, wanted to say thanks much for all your hardwork and research and sharing what can be a very powerful tool here if one can identify the daily trend which i do not think is too difficult although we should never take for granted and keep an eye out. I read every page on this thread and i am to believe the semi auto version originally posted is to be the best option. I got confusing to the middle of this thread. so much tal;k of an   
EA auto and different questions. I was very tempted to organize ALL of it on a pdf to help out but quite honestly i am so tired from reading this whole thing. Probably best to sum it up by sticking wiht original semi auto drive with original rules as samuri seems to be getting very consistent results even thru difficult trading times.....  
  
Big salute to the ones that really help to make this work and glad to have found this. i will run this live with small lots next couple months and be back to post results.

Hi there, thread participants.  
  
Thanks and respect to Samuraj Power and others who work tirelessly to realize the potential of Firebird by Trader Seven  
  
I have been reading through the posts, and backtesting various versions of Firebird, and I have been thinking of ways to filter out losing positions.  
  
Just now it struck me that the price action this EA uses is an oscillation: Lay the seeds on the way up and pick the fruits on the way down, and vice versa. These oscillations occur on different scales, and the biggest scale causes problems for Firebird. It picks long positions occasionally just as the large oscillation is about to turn South and short positions just as a large upward movement is about to commence.  
  
This large size price action wave happens more or less in a range - in other words: it is a range based price movement (not always of course, but often).   
  
Now, a very good indicator to indicate range based turns is the Stochastic. So why don't we apply the stochastic on an appropriate scale as a filter for halting long trades on top of the price action hill top and short trades in the very bottom of the valley?  
  
The default Stoch setting is 5 3 3 - I tried Stoch setting 288 172 172 instead on a five minute chart, and lo and behold, the Stoch 'value' line appeared below 20 just as a short trade would have been disastrously wrong and above 80 when a long position would have lost one money. Isn't it marvellous?  
  
This also means that both long and short trades can be taken at other times when this over sized Stoch is neither oversold or overbought.  
  
The version I checked this out with is [Firebird v63G trader seven]. If one of you super intelligent coders could stick a Stoch filter in there I think we'll be successful and very rich, all of us. (...I hope) ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Cheers

Interesting Divyendu perhaps Xchaparro would be so kind as to help us with that? I would love to start testing on a Demo. Thanks for the input.

For the guys trying to automate this Ea. I wanted to try and contribute something that i personally use in my trading also to determine reversal of daily trend that seems to be very exact for me on trending pairs. It is based on price itself instead of cross overs,and I personally believe it has something to do with the fibonaci mathematical phemona. One of the main numbers in fibs is .5 or 5.. the pros generally like a .5 retracemnt. There seems to be something very profound about that number in the universe.  
  
My obervation doesnt really have to do with fibs but i feel it is tied in somehow. i am pretty new to to forex so im no pro, just making observations.  
  
Instead of a MA crossover or at least in combination with an ea crossover, if you plot a 5 period ema on any chart, doesnt matter the tf. If price _**CLOSES**_ above the 5 period ema then trend is up. If price _**CLOSES**_ below the 5 period ema then trend is down and usually continues to do so. It works on any time frame any pair and is great sign to exit a trade or keep an eye on opening a new one. Now it is not 100% perfect as nothing is but on daily charts is much more reliable and could help identify trend reversal if ti could be coded in with the ma crosses and such.  
  
sure hope it may help  
bulls  
  
ps real live use would be to look @ eu right now on daily. plot the 5 period ema. you would see that price HAS closeD above 5 period ema and we could be looking @ a temp revesal. we got price action AND close above 5 ema and i like trix,,,is also showing green, bounce off lower end of channel. all good signs, but eur is weak so how much up we'll see.

In generall there is no siginificant update here on this thread, in the middle of the thread I tried to filter the trade by only trading in a high posibility only (when the HA and Arrow is in line), but still need a tweak. Some of our friends here still trying to automated the EA but I havent found some significant improvement.

The only major problem is to recognize the daily trend, when its done then the case is solve.  
I think the key is Price action, fibo and trend line on 4H chart, coz I think we can see where the daily chart goes by looking at 4hour chart behaviour, and we would get an early alert when the price tries to change the trend. But any suggestion is highly appreciated. Thanks

Hi xchaparro, Fredella, and others  
  
I did some chart studies (see post 500), and here are some filter settings that would cut down the risk for bad trades quite a lot. Of course some good trades would be affected, but the overall winning statistics I feel could be improved if something like this could be implemented:  
  
Stoch + ADX filter: apply on [Firebird v63G trader seven]  
  
Indicators on 4hour time base  
Stoch 15, 9, 9  
ADX 28  
  
1) ADX falling and Stoch within 30/70 = all trades accepted  
  
2) ADX falling and Stoch over 70 or below 30= no positions entered in the direction of oversold / overbought  
  
3) ADX rising and Stoch within 20/80= no position entered against Stoch direction of travel  
  
4) ADX rising and Stoch beyond 20/80 = no trade  
  
The specific settings of what would constitute overbought/oversold could be made external to allow calibration.  
  
I will try to think of the code myself, but I'm afraid I'm terribly amateurish, most likely to introduce bugs as big as your fist... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Just install it on your PDA, control your chart on your VPS, and now your trading is in mobile whereever u are.

Divyendu,  
  
any ideas are most welcome here, hope xchapparo or Fridella sees that, and try to modified that in ea. I will set it up, and run some tests, I'm playing with other indis.,but most of them repaints or lag....  
  
Samurai thanks, I find that most useful, seems like you, I to need constant observation whenever I am ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi guys  
  
Changed tradelogic in line with my earlier post to include filtering with the help of Stoch and ADX. Backtesting over a three week period tend to increase a 10000 account by 500 or so.  
  
took away some unused functions  
  
Feel free to test, tweak and comment

thanks for helping out man, will test it today.  
Is this ment to be fully automatic, or is still needed control for set up Short or Long??  
  
I still use original trader seven EA, but today I notice, price went over 80pips from first short, and it didn't open that trades (pip step =40). It was on Usd/Jpy. Someone notice same problems in testing?? Some bug in EA mabey?

Hi Gasgas  
  
My thought is that the filter will filter out bad trades, so there should be no need to manually block long or short positions.  
It must be stressed that this is not yet tested and is certain not to work yet in many cases - so no live trading with this one yet!!  
  
The target for developing a fully automated EA should be to put the odds more and more in ones favor - for the filters to kill off more bad trades than good ones (in pip value), and to lessen the likelihood of big drawdowns (larger positions can then be entered without too much risking blowing ones account).  
  
I have one more idea for putting the odds in our favor:  
Bad trades need to travel all the way to the stop loss which is further away than the take profit level. Therefore bad trades are normally longer lasting than good ones. Lets say for the sake of argument that most of the good trades in a particular currency cross last no more than 100 bars and most of the bad trades last more than 150 bars. Then it would be possible to put a trade-kill function at 125 bars.  
It would kill a long position as soon as the Stoch cycle reaches a peak and a short position as the Stoch cycle reaches a valley.  
In this way a loosing trade could be less costly by many many pips.  
  
This type of function is beyond my comfort level to code, so please, anybody with the skills.. We need your help!

Hello Divyendu,  
  
Your EA works fine but on some pairs it doesn't trade at all for the last three months. Maybe you reduce your filtering a bit more :-)

Hi, I agree this looks very promising on EURUSD, however, on GBPUSD I don't get positive results. Very strange ....

Hi Tokken  
Glad to see your positive result  
Fredella, hope we can find a solution to your bad result  
  
The first idea: to filter out potentially disastrous trades with the help of a combination of ADX and Stoch - it needs calibration as per the commonly occurring price action on each different pair. Is it easier to just make separate copies of the EA for separate pairs, just to avoid complexity?  
  
The larger price fluctuation (the one that out-runs the existing stop loss) has to be mirrored as far as possible by the Stochastic read out. Different values have to be tried out until it looks right. I doubt this calibration can be automatized, it is just a matter of visually making sure that Stoch hits overbought at the same time as the price produces one of those large peaks - and a valley for oversold. the Stoch values can also be external values (in the EA code) allowing for back testing and fine tuning it for each currency pair. This system of filtering trades can prevent any trade at all in a strong sustained trend (Perhaps then another trend following system can be put to good use. The problem is to know when the trend is at an end!!). I think the ADX value is pretty robust and does not need to be different for different pairs.  
  
The second idea - to kill off trades that fail to hit Take Profit before they have a chance to hit Stop Loss (see post 516) - it would be nice if some more competent programmer could set it up. I'm just a beginner.   
  
Again: That trade killing parameter has to be calibrated to the price action of each pair, and it has to be double blind tested to see if it actually increases profit or decreases risk.  
  
Please note: the EA I posted quotes values suited to brokers using five decimal places. ;D

What about on days where we have a big doji or near bottoms or tops of trends and also days where we are in a nice down trend but have a bullish pullback for a day or vice versa. I am having a real hard time believing this can be automated. It is a strong tool but only under human watch,,,but good luck to those trying.....

I've had it on GBPJPY and EURCHF but It's because I was testing on the Daily Timeframe I think.  
  
We have to tweak it for every pair on the most profitable timeframe.

Do you guys test pairs with Jpy? In my backtesting, pairs with Jpy almost didn't open positions on M5, then I throw ea on 1M chart and it opens many positions. Strangly, it seems this is needed only for pairs with Jpy.

Mhmm...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
The chart give a signal for short, but the price moves up for 100-140pips, not indicating any short until today close, but the major trend is still in down trend, if u guys take this day trade it will be in minus positition, but im thingking it will continue the down move next day, at this time it will be a hard times (emotion will play role here), i've been thru those difficult days, but this is what the system will give u, sometimes its against u till -200 (i almost cry) but then the market recover your position again and ends up with hundreed of green pips (but still cant smile since I was still shock), but it can kick my butt also sometimes. Btw i miss taking the today signal.

Hello all/Samurai.  
  
Well, actually, if trading Gbp/Usd (Short) today, would give +200pips,  
and I trade it -demo-. A traded it, couse last candle closes below channel-mid line. Its not for sure bad if price went up before, its even good-it would open some positions, and close them in the way down later that day (well, if comes down![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)).  
I also went long with Eur/Chf and gain 150pips. Boy, I really should went live today![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi  
  
I've given up on the idea to fully automatize Firebird.   
Looked into Cobra's THV system, and it seems to be a good setup for 'driving' Firebird. Seems like even people with time constraint can drop in on the charts (on VPS, perhaps) once a day to make sure the system doesn't drive over a cliff.

dont give up Divy  
  
  
your EA s working well for me, it made me a very good results till now  
  
i am using your EA with a few pairs, and looks great  
  
i think your main idea is the right way, may be u must work on it a little bit, but the direction is right  
  
and the end of the week, i ll post the results of your system  
  
just wait

Divyendu, full automatic and drive version is really not that different, as u said, check in 2-3 times/day, to see how is going, that would be done even if were fully auto, right?  
  
Trading Eur/Chf and Gbp/Jpy today, both going my way, but nether open trades. I guess Firebird don't like todays movement.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)  
As when to trade, we also need to talk about when not to trade, as Samurai said, please post daily charts of loosing days also, so we can anylize it what went wrong.

Hey Divy  
  
  
i am testing your EA, so now i have some problem, cos the EA making a few wrong position, for example now it s making sell on EUR USD but the the daily trend is up, so i don t understand why  
  
few hours ago it made a buy position, and i tought it will contiune till the trend is up  
  
  
can u check it what s the problem,   
  
without that mistake, the EA would be fine  
  
very promising, i belive in it

Hi tokken  
  
The EA works in mysterious ways ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
I am not 100% familiar with the logic that drives the position taking of the EA - without our attempted additions of filters etc. Just because the daily trend is up doesn't mean the EA will take all possible long trades  
  
Thanks for your encouragement to do more work on this project. At the moment I am hammering out a bum-trade filtering system based on a long range Stochastic that would be dynamically re-calibrated by a long moving average, as the topping out levels of Stoch depends a great deal on which way the trend goes. Please don't have any unrealistic expectations of a fool proof system. We are just trying to change the odds a little ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Take care

the thing, i don t know the system of your EA, i mean why or when ll open a trade  
  
just i am testing, may be we have to see the signals of the indicators to understand it  
  
I continue the testing of your EA

Hi Samurai,   
  
I've also been looking at the THV system to drive the EA.  
  
Although most of the traders use THV on a 1/5 minute TF it still gives very good daily signals, as well as giving warning signs as to when a trade maybe coming to an end.  
  
I've been trying out the EA over the last week and I'm already up 800 pips in demo by driving it based on the daily signals. I'm using the EA that was posted on page 1.  
  
There have been a few variations of the EA and I'm not sure which ones are supposed to be fully automated and which are the driven ones.   
  
Can you let me know which EA you are using now for your trading in semi-automated mode?  
  
Thanks,  
  
Joe

thats great, u already tested THV template to this system,thats saving my time to foward test, can u please post the detail statement so that I can learn. Did u set the THV template in default or did u change the indi setting, can u please post also the pic of your chart. thx  
  
Im using EA on post one, never change it, except I set the TP to 100pips, and the rest of the EA on this thread is fully auto EA.

I think cobra THV template can gives quite good information on pointing the beginning and the end of a trend on daily chart, so we still can continue driving and ride the EA till the time when we have to stop or turn, hope we dont overtrade and ride the car over a cliff, right divy?  
im gonna try it on a trade simulator program i posted few pages earlier here to see the win rate, i suggest u guys try it also,and post it ok, much accurate than backtest. I mean find the signal on the trade simulator that THV template gives u, and backtest those signal on the spesific day.  
Hopefully cobra doesnt mind we using his template here..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

Hi! I just wanted to thank Samurai for the idea of this Firebird. Since it was so interesting and profitable.   
  
I manage to use the idea Firebird V63G and instead of using the original/initial trend indicator in your very first post, I used Don Steintz customize Heiken Ashi template with his indicators.   
  
It is a one window to all the timeline trend. If most of the timeline is read, I drive the EA to short...   
  
I have been trading live on my account since 9/3/09 since I stumble upon your site and have done 600pips to date with -17pip float. @ 0.01 mini lot.   
  
Not bad.... So far so good.  
  
Anyway thanks again...   
  
I am thinking of EURUSD next but would want to optimize the step pips, TP, SL since it's daily range is not as big as GBPUSD... Will see and hopefully feedback good news... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Good day all,  
Today I trade Gbp/Chf and Usd/Chf, all okey, I'm +300 pips and I'm shutting it down for today, see pic, reason why.  
Price jumped over 400pips up in 20min.(my way), I even can't imagine what would happen, if live and if goes other way, This is chart that scares me. I checked, there were CHF major news at 2pm gmt+1, and it looks like, pushes price. I more or less ignore news till now, well, not any more, I don't like surprises like this....  
  
Edit: Should we plant MaxOrder funkcsion in EA?

Yes Samurai, I still play with T/p, at the moment market is more or less ranging, so I use smaller t/p's, for Gbp/Usd I use 100pips, and when good trend. 100pips is still best t/p as suggested by you in overall BTW.  
  
Can someone plant Max(open)OrdersFunkcion, so EA won't open more than x chosen numb. of positions? thanks

I believe we will need the sourcecode of the THV Trix indicator to implement that. Does anyone have this sourcecode?

Here you go, attach is the indicators I used, hope it helps everyone. One thing I must at, the semi auto one must be really ready for daily change movements. I have been away from my trading desktop for the past 2 days.   
  
Unable to turn it off yesterday. I did not notice the indicators has actually changed upwards... Sigh... now my float is -200pips.... but realize is +650pips... Still those are good pips realized.   
  
One of the reason why I took to this strategy idea is that Don's EA might also be semi auto (long story, will explain it one of these days)... and I have to monitor this robot... so I thought hey since I am monitoring this robot, might as well apply this strategy as I will be monitoring it too...   
  
But I forgotten to turn Firebird off when I knew I was going to leave my trading station for 3 days... Fortunately or unfortunately for me, it is still holding up but the 4H trends has changed, which would have signaled me that the daily trend might also changed... which in turn means I should turn it off and no longer take anymore trades.... but it is still taking trades...   
  
Well... lesson learned... anyway... with stop loss of 300pips @ 0.01 mini lots it is a 3 bucks lesson ... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) or maybe 6 bucks because I have 2 position open.  
  
I don't think I will be able to post my statement... Reason is I am also running Don Steintz EA on my live account. If I do post it, one will really really need to look for the trades...   
  
Can I post my MT4Stats.com statement on this forum? I am new and have read the terms, so I am not sure if that would breach any rules...   
  
From that you will be able to see, that my current EA is making a lot of trades thus drowning this EA Drive entries.   
  
I am following up the trades of this strategy using a spreadsheet... That is the reason how I calculated my pips...

Mhmm..![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1) it should working fine if u already checked everything, anyone having the same problem? i think just try from the begining again maybe u miss something.  
I didn't change anything on the file in the first post, it's about FF bandwith I guess, lots of people downloading so that u have to download several times untill u reach the file size, try download it again till u reach the file size.

the file size is much smaller than the EA

Hi Guys  
  
Been testing this system for a while with favorable results, but am having a problem with all the alert chimes. I want to turn them off; all the sound. I've tried turning off within the indicators but still it can make a racket at times.  
  
Does anyone know what I need to do to turn off all the sounds?  
  
Thanks

it has something to do with the program i guess, in mt4 platform try go to Tools>option and select tab "event", set them disable, but it will turn off all of the sound.  
  
About your testing, can u please post the detail statement and the indis u are using with so we can learn. Thx

This one also does not seem to work. Maybe try attaching the mq4 and tpl files rather than a zipped file.

Thx, it still the same, I already download it from the original thread.  
  
Btw looking at the BGPUSD chart, with THV template showing up move direction will give u about +200 to +300 pips today if u took the trade and drive it long. It shows up move since yesterday, and if u take the trade from yesterday it would give u arround +600 pips, try to drive long since yesterday on backtest, it gives u +633 pips.

thx Gasgas i ll try your adivce  
  
  
Sp how exactly u use the thv system, if i check the picture/chart above, there is no cleare signal to buy  
  
according to Cobra is the best way if u make only a short position below the "coral" and buy above the "coral", so that signal could be a worng one too  
  
but the best thing if we are making some foward test

Sory tokken I forgot to add some note, bassically reading the THV template is not quite different with reading my template, THV is more advance compare to my template, i just add 5-8 open EMA to it,  
BTW coral is a good indis on 5 min or 1 min chart, but on daily chart the signal confirmation will be too late, so i only see the fast trix indis and the trend bar indis (green, red and yellow bar below chart),fast trix is quite good on seeing the trend even its on daily chart. Overall its more complete than my template. Hope thats help.

Hi all,   
I have been trading this version for last 3 days only on my Demo a/c. Starting capital approx. $7600. At first on default setting with MM on and after a few profitable trades I input 1% risk and added TS of 25 on Eur/Usd, Aud/Usd and Eur/Usd (the only pairs I trade). I have got a floating loss of $750 and profits of about $3000 ($2250) if I manually close all my positions just now.   
The funny thing is that TS works on Eur and Gbp pairs but not on Aud. Overall I'm happy with the result but for this glitch. And another thing is because of heavy ups and downs sometimes it trades in both directions which is good just now as it hedges certain losing trades.  
Fyi I use it on 5m TF only. The other settings remain default only. Today also it keeps on opening new positions. Totally 11 open trades as of now.BTW the biggest losing trade is the opened b4 I changed the risk value downwards.  
Any comments or suggestions? I have not back tested it but all this is from forward testing.  
  
Now I come to my real problem. I have opened another Demo a/c with same broker for a capital of $250 and put the EA to test with the same parameters. It has not executed even a SINGLE trade. So doesnt this EA work with small amount? Any feedback will be appreciated.

Hello and thank you for the great information. I just had some questions relating to "Driving" the Ea with the indicator. I tried downloading your zip file and does not seem to be an MT4 indicator or a template. (file does not have .mq4 extention) Where can I obtain your indicator?  
  
I received a similar looking indicator free from the Forex Maestro people, called "forex silver". Since Maestro is basically Firebird repackaged I am wondering if this is the same indicator you are referring to? (has red and blue arrows signalling trend)  
  
**You mention to set the EA to trade long only or short only depending on which way the trend is going. Is this setting available in another version of Firebird, because does not seem to be available in V63H04, or V63H04-TS?**  
  
I also had another question about your strategy in general, you seem to be using the 5M charts for trading, have you found this to be more profitable overall? I have been using 15M so far with some pretty good results for the couple days I have been testing. Also in terms of the SL, you mention you are using a SL of 300. I have been using the default SL of 40 and TP 20, is this not a good idea? I realize many of my trades may get stopped out that would have eventually turned around, but 300pip SL just seems very risky to me. 1 Loss and you could be losing weeks worth of profit.  
  
Also if any of you could point me to the right direction on a previous post regarding Ideal settings, and best currencies to trade for the Firebird V63H04 (regular and trailing stop versions) that would be great.  
  
Thanks in advance for any help.

Yes Vinesh, i've tried those version too, if u set the ea and let it run it will keep open trades and u cant control it, yes u have few thousands pips profit now, but soon when the trend changing u are gonna have a very huge losses, thats why i came up with the idea of driving the EA long or short only based on the current trend on daily chart, its more controllable, and the profit looks great also.  
  
if u set capital for only $250 then u gonna have to adjust the TP, SL and pipstep accordingly, microlot I guess, 0.01 pips, so that the EA has enough money to trade with. Hopes thats help.

Hi sergie,  
  
I think we have problems here with zip file, ok i'll attach it on first post and u can download it there.  
  
About the firebird driving, i think we can drive all EA, but i found that Firebird is the most profitable one. How to drive it please refer to my word file I attached on the first post.  
  
I'm using it on 5min chart wich i found to be enough profitable, but some of us here trying to put it on 1 min and it works too, u can use your favorable timeframe if u find its more profitable.  
  
About 300 SL, best currencies, and setting, please refer to post 1. Hopes thats help.

Thank you Samurai for your reply and clarifications. I was basically scared of that only , hence my mail. When thrend changes (and I think it changed today only) my account can be wiped out in 2 hrs. Already I have a floating P/L of -$1000 because the EA doest stop putting on trades LOL. It has a mind of its own.

Thanks for reposting the files Samurai. There is one question that remains unanswered in the Word FAQ or any of the posts you referred to. That is how do you manually drive the EA to trade only short or only long to match the corresponding daily trend? There doesn't seem to be a setting on any of the Firebird EA's to control this.  
  
Also are there any big differences between Firebird V63H04 and the Firebird V63G Trader-Seven beside the "safe zone" concept?  
  
Thanks Again  
Serge

Ok let see this THV daily template.  
  
Look at the white arrow I circled, its pointing up since 11 Mar 2008.  
Confirmed by this indis below:  
Look at the Heiken Ashi candle color, its green on 12 Mar 2008.  
Look at the fast trix indis, it shows green line appear form 12 Mar 2008  
Look at the trend bar indis, it shows green bar also from 12 Mar.  
Now look at the plain candle on the right side of the THV template.  
At 10 of March, the price seems to run out of gas to continue move down, confirmed by the next plain daily candle on 12 March seems like uptrend is dominant.  
So.. after all of that aspect confirmed, take the trade on 13 March, drive it long, and u get approximately +350pips a day ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
This is an example, u might have a better indis to make a beter descicion...  
Hopes thats explain the idea in general.

Thanks Samurai, that is helpful but I think you may have misunderstood my question.   
  
How do you make the EA only take short trades once you determine the trend is short. Or vice versa how do you make the EA only take long trades once you determine the trend is long?  
  
The EA itself, how do you control it? Do you just manually close all trades that it wants to open in the opposite direction of the trend?  
  
Ps. where can I get the rest of your fancy indicators, lol.   
  
Thanks again for all your help I do appreciate it.  
Serge

Ups..  
Actually i made that clear on the word file I attached on the first post.  
  
Ok...  
Go to Navigator toolbar button.  
Open the expert folder.  
Pick the EA and drag it to the chart.  
It will open the window just like the pic below.  
or simply press F7 to open the window for adjusting the EA direction.

Ha..ha..human...  
Btw I think many people seeing this thread has the same problem. I updated the first post and add a note how to drive the EA, hope it clears this kind of question.

Ya, my applogies for not reading your word file a little closer, lol.  
  
Man I've been trying to download the THV V3 system but every time I download it from the various sites and extract the file its just one file without an .mq4 extention  
  
Not sure why keep getting the same problem over and over. After I unzip it should have all the indicators and template files. Not sure what is going on there.  
  
I already have the Isakus system which seems fairly similar, but I like the look of the THV on your charts. YOu wouldn't happen to know where there is a download that works?  
  
Thanks

Even without driving, the back test for EU for 2009 is very profitable. Max order opened was 9.   
  
The high profits make me wonder if the results obtained are reliable.

Hi ahbinn,  
Do u mean drive the EA Long&Short? or Short only?  
Coz if u set it Long&Short the backtest shows a very huge losses.

Hello people  
  
Im trying with new thing to determine, if next candle is tredable or not and which dirrection to trade. For this week, I'm up around 800+ pips (reallity goal is +500). I will trade that way for another week or two, and if resoults will be good, I will post my strategy, otherwice no (to save you some time). Some rules are needed, but I try to keep it simple.

Hello all I just want to say this thread has been great and has re-inspired me somewhat after 3 + years of dabbling with forex demo accounts on and off.  
  
One thing I have learned is that:   
1) when testing EA's backtesting can be used as sort of a first hurdle or test for your EA to decide whether to keep or toss in the junk pile, but really tells you zip regarding whether or not the EA will be profitable in forward testing.   
  
2) Trading live will be a little different than the results you get on a demo account.  
  
So this brings me to my next question, just out of curiosity have any of you gone live with this EA using the "Driving" technique according to the daily trends? If so how have your results been thus far? I know there have been a couple live results scattered throughout this long thread but I thought it would be neat to poll all the live users at this point to see how they are doing.  
  
Thanks again  
Serge

Hi sergiel and all,  
  
Something i would like to say about, yes demo account result will be different with live result, coz emotion plays its role (thats the only differences), me myself dont recomend taking this live untill u have a really really really good experience with this, demo for at least 3 month so u can have all the feel, spescially on a difficult times, take as much as possible difficult time with this system, and learn how to encounter it, i'm telling u guys this is really really important, i do really know exactly this is a very powerfull tools, but there is still a risk that u might not be able to handle if u dont dont know how to use it, keep learn and learn and learn how to encounter it, minimum deposit is very very dangerous, im highly recomend to take at least 0.1lot for every $10.000 per pair. So dont be in a rush to take this live just becouse u have 1 week profit with this, there is still lots of time to catch green pips, meanwhile take this thread a good place to disscuss how to encounter bad trade, knowing how to enter, how to stop, and how to turn the EA is the key for this system.  
I'm not gonna stop saying this to you all, and i will keep continue posting this advice and u guys have to really...really keep in mind what i'm just saying for our own good![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).

Ha..ha..thats my dream stevenali, i've been wondering that since long time ago, but since i think its nearly impossible (my opinion, but still keep hoping) so I have to stick with driving this![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
Thx for the indis, i will try different setting.

Very good advice Samurai. I personally plan on testing several versions for a min of 1 month before I even consider going live with a micro account. I would like to add one small qualification to what you said.   
  
I am by no means an expert as I have never traded live but from what I have read there may be a small difference in result btw a live & demo beyond just emotion. This is due to slippage etc especially if you are using a dealing desk with an actual human being sitting on the other end as opposed to a non-dealing desk. But if you are using a reputable broker shouldn't be too much of a difference.

I hope you didn't take offence to my last post, just wanted to make sure all newbies were fully informed before putting their hard earned money on the line.  
  
Not to get off topic too much but speaking of brokers, are you trading live right now Samurai? If so do you have any recommendations?  
  
I was thinking Alpari...have read some good things about them, and other EA's seem to perform best with Alpari as compared to the other Major brokers (prob has alot to do with low [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide")).  
  
Thanks  
Serge

Tell your wife that 'Toyota' maybe a Brand name but it is commercialized. You are not selling your knowledge but helping people like me. We will also make green pips with your help I'm sure.  
If we cannot then it is our 'Karma'. I am an Indian and believe in 'Karma'.

It still will work Vinesh, just load all of the indis on the chart, set all of the paramater according to cobra's rules, and save your own template.

Hey all just had another quick question. If I have the Max Orders set to 3 on each currency pair I am running will this allow up to 3 orders at once for each currency pair, or does this limit the EA to 3 total orders across all currency pairs I am running?  
  
I am guessing each currecy pair is seperately controlled by the EA attached to its chart but just wanted to make sure.  
  
Thanks

Yes Shogun, I am running the V63H04, and the V63H04-TS versions. These versions run much differently then the one you are using. This version uses a default: TP = 18, SL = 42, and Pip Step = 40. The TS version also uses a Trailing Stop of 30 pips.  
  
I think it will probably have more losing trades than the version you are running however these will be limited to 42 pips. This style fits my comfort level a little better cutting down on the big swings.  
  
But having said that it will be interesting to see if you guys running the V63G version can cut down on the losses by "Driving" it.   
  
I will also be attempting to "Drive" as well so it will be nice to compare the two.  
  
Happy Trading!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I see that sergiel, in my opinion 42 SL is too tight for my firebird version, it was disscussed on the previous thread that it will hit SL quite often, but maybe your version has a different behaviour than the one im using with, can u please post your version, im just cuorious, thx

Sure Shogun, it is Firebird V63H04 and can be found here: [http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...a-archives.htm](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives.htm)  
  
I have only traded with it for one day, as I just came across it on Thursday evening while doing some research on Maestro. However with my very, very limited test results so far not too bad.  
  
It made 9 winning trades of 18 pips and 1 losing trade of 42 pips for a total of +120 pips. This was on the EurUsd currency alone during about a 14 hour period (From Thurs night 9pm E.S.T to Friday 11 am E.S.T.)  
  
**Interesting is that the losing trade was a Sell EurUsd order. If I had been "Driving" the Ea I would have noticed that there was definitely an up-trend on March 12,13 so would have had the EA set to "Long Only". However on the flip side 4 out of the successful 9 trades it made were Sell orders so it would have actually came out worse off overall if I had done that.**  
  
What I will probably end up doing is running two simultaneous tests: One with the "Drive" strategy, and one without. This EA seems to have some extra safeguards built in compared to the V63G, so may be interesting to see which test comes out with more profits.  
  
Hope this helps, will keep you posted.

Hi sergiel,  
  
I have tested those firebird version, and it seems like most of the EA there looks similar to the EA I found on the previous thread, I noticed that it behaves in the same way to the version im using now, what you are using is just different setting with mine, but it has an extra features like max open order, and trailing stop, im not using this features, but for some reason some of our friends here need that features, im considering of changing your version to be my default EA, but still need to take a look a bit more.

Actually I tried to do a backtest in MT4 yesterday but wouldn't work for some reason. I tried it on a fairly short period (3 months) so not sure what the problem is.  
  
How do you backtest, is there another program you use or another website where you can plug in the EA and test it?  
  
Thanks  
Serge

The answer to the first section of your question I just keep them all on default, except for lotsize that depends on your account size. For a $3K demo account I am using a 0.1 lot size. And for the second part of your question refer to the file I attached.

Hi sergiel, namretik, and all.  
  
Just load the set file i attached, how?  
load the EA to the chart  
press F7  
in "inputs" tab click "load"  
select the set file according to your broker platform  
click ok  
  
all of the parameter will be inputed automatically, u can check that out.  
  
I was unable to upload set file, so i made it on zip file, its only 1kb, hopefully there will be no problem.

Hey Samurai, well I did a little backtesting and here is what I found.  
  
Over a three month period using EurUsd and 0.1 lots  
  
the V63G with TP=50, SL= 300 made about a 29% gain. The EA I am using (V63H04) with TP=18 and SL = 42 with a max of 3 open orders pretty much broke even.  
  
Hmmm I wonder if I am wasting my time with the ol V63H04 using SL=42.  
  
But Check this out I did some testing with the V63H04 using TP=50, SL=300 and Max Order = 5 and it had just a little less gain (24%) but the Max Drawdowns were cut in half, only $1033 as compared to $2500 on the V63G.   
  
The thing that concerns me most about the version your using is that you cant control the number of open orders. If several trades go against you I can see getting margined called fairly quickly.

Another update, your probably already aware but the 5min was more profitable than the 15 min for the V63G for my 3 month backtest.  
  
I did have another question Samurai. In my 3 month back test for EurUsd using the V63G I found that it only had about 10% losers (19 out of 204 trades). If you "Drive" the Ea you will be cutting down on these losses but wouldn't the winners you are cutting out outwiegh the avoided losers?  
  
Eg. in my 3 month backtest (Jan1 - March 14) the period between Jan 1 - Jan 23 2009 there was a continuos downtrend on the daily charts but the EA made 23 buys in that period, if you look at the results only 1 buy turned out to be a loser. So in theory if you had your EA set to Short only you would have avoided 1 loss of 300pips but missed out on 23 winners for 1150 pips.  
  
Does the EA make more short trades then it otherwise would have if you have it set to short only? If this is how it works then I can clearly see the "Drive" idea, but having a hard time with it otherwise.  
  
If you could take a look at a backtest for Jan 1 - March 14 on 5 min chart for V63G. Take a look at period of Jan 1 - Jan 23 in particular and let me know what you think.  
  
Thanks Samurai

LOL, just did a 1 year back test much different story. The EA basically broke even. It was just that the last 3 months were ideal conditions.  
  
2 year backtest EA lost 40% of capital first year and broke even by end of second year.  
  
This EA obviously needs some intervention to be profitable long term!

Hi sergie and all,  
  
I think u miss a little information about how to backtest this system,   
did u drive it correctly? (even its on backtest)  
Use a trade simulation application i post in the few pages earlier to find days when the trend continue up or continue down, or when the trend flat based on the daily THV template. MARK THOSE DATES.  
And then drive the EA on backtest based on those date u marked, EACH DAY COUNT, treat it exactly just like when u foward test it, the skill on finding the right direction at the particular date on THV daily template is determining the result of the backtest (gives u a big picture of the result on foward test in demo or real account), the more expert your skill on recognizing the daily trend the more better the result.   
  
Let me give u an example how to backtest.  
Put the THV daily template on the trade simulator, let say for a period of 1 month (Jan 1st 2009 to Jan 31 2009), then u click start.  
When its simulating the market u analyse each day trend, then mark those dates and give a note about trend direction, lets say this is the result:  
(simple example)  
1\. Jan 1st 2009 - Jan 7th 2009 the trend is down.  
2\. Jan 8th 2009 - Jan 11th 2009 the trend is flat.  
3\. Jan 12th 2009 - Jan 15th 2008 trend is up.  
4\. Jan 16th 2009 -Jan 31st 2008 trend is down.  
  
then based on that note, backtest it and drive the EA, and see the result.  
Like i mention before, treat backtest exactly just like when u foward test it. Trade when the daily trend is up or down, and dont trade if u find the daily trend is flat.  
  
On foward test u do analyse the daily chart and make a desicion to enter, still continue trade, or stop right? and u get the result.  
  
Its exactly the same...  
  
U analyse daily chart from trading simulator,  
and u get the result from backtest.  
  
The general idea is really simple.  
  
Ok, now u can re-backtesting it again, and post the result for 2 years of period for EURUSD pair (if u have time)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
Please remeber this.  
"KNOWING HOW TO DETERMINE DAILY TREND AND HOW TO DRIVE THE EA IS REALLY..REALLY IMPORTANT."

Hi all,  
Why shd it open many lots if you put pippage to 100. it'll open only 2 lots as on the 3rd opening you'll have touched SL on lot no. 1.

Thanks Samurai, one thing I was wondering, when I look at my daily EurUsd it seems as though Jan 12 - 15 2009 (I am assuming you meant 2009 and not 2008) is a clear downtrend. Was that just a typo on your post?  
  
Another thing I am wondering why would they even relese the V63H04 when it bombs so badly on back tests? Is it possible that the backtest doesn't take into account the "safe zone" safeguard on the new EA? Or does the backtest take everything into consideration?  
  
Thanks  
Serge

Vinesh i dont get your point.  
  
Sergiel, that note is just an example.  
About EA as i ever mentioned there is no "set and forget" EA and hoping that it will generate a consistant profit,the market is changing overtime, otherwise we all rich, sergie u have to understand all of the consept.  
  
I suggest u all to read from the first page in detail for better understanding the whole idea, its only 40 pages long, it will take a while but u can get all the benefit.

Samurai I understand that completely, always have, thats exactly why I returned the Fap Turbo, nothing is that easy or simple it is bound to crash eventually. What I dont understand is if an EA fails that miserably on the backtest right off the bat what good is it? The V63H04 performs terribly, doesn't even break even, I dont think any amount of "driving" is going to make this one worth the time.  
  
The V63G on the otherhand, at least it is making small gains on the backtest without any intervention.....there you have something to work with. Like I said before a backtest has nothing to do with how it will perform in the future, but can be used as the first test if it fails junk it.  
  
The V63H04 Fails according to my backtest, IMHO.  
  
Not sure I want to even waste my time running a test on it for the next month.  
  
Thanks  
Serge

Hi Sergie,  
  
V63G and V63H04 work and behave exactly the same, the V63H04 has extra features like max order and trailing stop (some of us need that features), its different on the parameter setting, u can check it out by loading the set file i just gave u to both of the EA and test for the month of aug 2008 drive short only and u will get exactly the same result, arround 3095pips.

That is true, I guess I should have been more clear, the V63H04 with default settings of TP=18, SL=42 fails miserably. You predicted this earlier...good call.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hey all just getting started with Samurai's "Drive" the EA method.  
  
The market just opened up an hour ago and seems like this is my first opportunity to take notice at whats going on. At close of last week the EurUsd was on a fairly strong upward trend but judging from a quick glance at the Daily, 4H, 1H, and 30M charts it appears like it is either headed back down or will go side ways for a while.  
  
Guess I'll be sitting out for now.  
  
Attached is my daily chart.  
  
Any thoughts, good call or too early to tell?  
  
Thanks  
Serge

Thanks Samurai. Just to make sure Im on the right track are you sitting out tonight for EU currency as it seems to be going sideways at the moment, or are you sticking with the Long Only setting?  
  
Ps. All my MT4 accounts wont let me back test any further back then Nov 2008. Any idea why this may be?  
  
Thanks  
Serge

This will probably sound strange but it was just a gut feeling that something was not right. They seemed more concerned with pushing users to sell more copies with their silly affiliate contests, then they were in making sure the system stays profitable.  
  
With 100,000 people using the same program which initiates trades at the exact same time something's gotta give sooner or later its just common sense. I realize they have updated it so that users have more control now, but I dont think that is going to solve the problem.  
  
Also when it did have a losing trade it was a large loss, usually 2 or 3 days worth of trades, and it would happen fairly often. I guess Im just uncomfortable with a completely automatic EA, just cant be possible unless its updated all the time IMHO.  
  
I prefer the semi-automatic system dealt with in this thread, seems fairly promising but only time will tell.

If I am using the Firebird EA on the 5 min chart should this MAtimeframe be set to 5. I am using your techinque to drive this ea. I see that the default on this setting is 15.   
  
Also what is the pipsgoal and the pips loss setting for? Also mine is defaulted to 5000 is that the right setting.  
  
Found my answer on post 42.

So far so good. Obviously very, very premature to celebrate lol, but first 24 hours of trading +250 pips  
  
Was a little concerned at one point this afternoon because one GU buy order had dipped down to -100 pips but that one is almost back up to even now.  
  
Anyone else cash in on the nice EurUsd GbpUsd uptrend today?

Hi,  
  
I'm a bit confused. Is anyone still using the original trend tools, or is the THV the new tool for establishing the trend?

I cashed 50 pips on the GBP today. Hoping for a good uptrend push by the end of the day. Still have 6 trades open with two positive and 4 negative. Biggest negative is 100 pips on the GBP

i agree, and that is what i done samurai...  
  
i found EURGBP is giving good result since i use SIDUS TREND for me to drive EA LONG or SHORT,   
  
i only change tp with 50 pip, SL with 240 pip and pipstep with 50 pip  
  
we need pair with ranging behaviour like eurgbp, so when trend is change we dont have big drawdown  
  
try to backtest it on eurgbp  
  
btw i use 15m TF

I dont think it matters as long as you can identify the trend. I like the THV indicators provided by Samurai because they give you a ton of info to help make a decision.  
  
Hope this helps

I haven't been using the EurGbp yet with this system. How does it compare? So far I have been using 3 currencies: EU, GU, UsCan, any thoughts on the best currencies?

In my limited experience with this method, I have found the hourly charts to be a bit misleading.  
  
For example on the daily charts both the EU and GU have been showing a clear uptrend for the last 2 days, but there was a few times where my hourly chart showed 2 or 3 bars downward and so I turned the EA off preventing any new trades.   
  
Sure enough a few hours later the trend reversed and kept heading back up in line with what the daily chart was telling me. I prob lost out on a couple trades by jumping the gun. Your always going to get waves within waves. I think a better indication might be if you see a downward shadow on the Daily, IMHO.  
  
I am still torn as to whether to let it ride when I see this on the hourly or turn off the EA and play it safe.  
  
What do you think Samurai?

Looks like a falling wedge pattern. In my experience it usually breaks to the north. I'm sticking to the daily pattern to drive this ea.

Hi All  
  
Does anyone of you know if there is a version of Firebird which has incorporated an automatic halting of trades when a loss occurs?  
  
I thought it could be a very useful feature  
  
Lets say you spot what looks like a good strong up trend and set the Firebird running long (buying mode) in the morning and then go to work. Then, mid afternoon, unbeknown to yourself the trend reverses and a stop-loss is hit...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
With a feature like this some big big losses can be avoided - right?  
  
If nothing like this has been thought of - and if people think it is a good idea - could somebody code it?

Sounds like it might be a neat feature. Or how about this:  
I dont know if this is possible to program because I am not a programmer but have The EA automatically turn off if your Daily HA candle develops a shadow in the opposite direction and the Trend Bar turns yellow.

first, i want to note that the brilian idea to use this EA is we must know the trend. All we need is self confidence using indicator to show the trend, and discipline using it  
  
the higher timeframe is most avoid false signals based on any indicator, especially indi based on MA, so why i use SIDUS TREND at 4H TF  
  
2nd. the RISK and REWARD Ratio is no good with this EA. 50 TP and 300SL mean we need 6 win to pay 1 lose  
but it's okay if our SL never touched, but market is very random....so good MM is the KEY to success  
  
3rd. i have no time to forward test it cause i have trade some accounts of my client, but if we know how to use STRATEGY TESTER WISELY, you can have a GLOBAL VIEW of any EA.  
  
4th. in my observation i more confidence with EURGBP because this pair is not so trending and with SL 250pip it's only touched once at 6 months  
  
5th. this pairs make me confidence to use bigger lot.  
  
1000$ = 1 mini lot x 1000 pip, but also  
1000$ = 4 mini lot x 250 pip  
  
we focus on MM....  
  
  
6th. this EA continues to open new position if price against our direction  
i see at gbpusd it more open position than if we use EURGBP,   
  
we can have good feeling at DEMO ACCOUNT but it can be a big problem if we use in LIVE ACCOUNT  
  
all your opinions are welcome  
  
thx

FYI the EA with features you want is FBv1.03 and FB v63 HO4 TS. And if you want same entries all you have to do is change use FB63D divergence.

I have to agree with you on the risk vs. reward problem, that was a big issue for me at first. However if you are very diligent in watching the trend "Driving it", and having the Dicipline to sit out once it starts to change I think it could still be profitable.  
  
It would be interesting to tweak with the TP and SL a bit and find the best result for the given currencies. Have any of you done any backtesting trying different combinations eg. tp=40 SL = 200 etc?  
  
Thanks  
Serge  
  
Ps. Update did a backtest on last 3 months without driving EA and had 700 pips more profit using TP=50, SL=250. This sort of makes sense if you think about it. If your position has gone bad by 250 pips its probably trending in the other direction by then so will likely hit 300 anyway. Prob need to do a longer backtest driving it to confirm for sure though. If anyone else has the time/motivation to do this and post your result, feel free, I have to get back to studying for finals, lol.

Hi guys,  
I see 3th different post about alert “excessive loss”. I have same problem, but only with one broker which is [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile"). I’m testing this EA with another two MT4 brokers and there is no problem. I have a feeling that this is no EA problem, but broker problem. They try to discourage us to using this EA. Could you all post which broker you are using?

im using [fxpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile"), but i think what makes the ea give an excessive lost alert is becouse u drive the to the wrong direction, improove your skill and u will not get that alert, i think this ea sholud work on familiar broker,just adjust the setting.  
  
update on semiauto.  
i learn GU behavior more than other, despite my template or thv templat, i think it still gonna continue down this week, and my prediction is right, if monday still gives an up move, i assumed not more than 300pips up move, then on tuesday the price might run out gas, as u can see on daily plain candle, and today i assume GU is falling, took sell from monday and it gives 300pips waiting for 500pips. For EU u have to pay attention just in case it reverse, watch for 4H chart.

See post #647, that version has that option, also MM and maxopen positions, but how that works didn't look into it yet.

Hi Samurai,  
  
I have read your posts with great interest.  
  
I would like to try it out, but it is not clear which version of Firebird you are using. Can you clarify and if possible supply links where to download it together with the necessary indicators (and maybe a reminder of your latest settings).  
  
I have been testing Firefox 63G for some time have have been having trouble with excessive drawdowns. I have also been trying opening two charts of the same pair, one using the EA on "buy only" and the other on "sell only" hoping to produce a hedging effect when the market is trending. So far, not too successful.  
  
Many thanks in advance  
  
Cheers

What rules did you use to go short on the GBPUSD. The news announcement caused the GBP to dive this morning. Did you see something yesterday to make you go short on the pound?

Under the THV template rules the fast trix has to cross the zero line after a cross up on the 1HR Chart. The GBPUSD fast trixed crossed on 3/16/09 but had not confirmed the uptrend by crossing the zero line. That might have kept one from going long at that point. Also on the 4hr GBP chart with the THV template the trix cross down below the zero line at the 4 GMT time on 3/18/09. That could have been early warning to close all long GBP trades if you were long.  
  
What do you think?

Samurai,  
  
I have been studying yr drive system.  
  
From my understanding, Firebird is built to profit from trades in BOTH directions, opening trades when it feels the trend is changing.  
  
By driving the EA in a single direction, say we drive long in a DAILY CHART UPTREND, we will be missing out on profitable sell trades in a retracement in a 5M chart !!  
  
Will our overall profit be lower compared to leaving the Firebird to open up trades as it sees fit???

Hi Namrettik,  
  
I wasnt looking my template or THV template for taking short since monday, I ignore it for a while and take GBPUSD behaviour as my descicion, I think that major down trend is still intach, it moves down spescially in early of the week, and its near major trend line..

Many thanks Samurai,  
  
All is in place and working except the "fb template.tpl". I copied it into the templates folder (it is there), but metatrader doesn't see it (it isn't in the list when I click on "load template"). BTW, all the files in the template folder are with the .mqt extension.  
  
To save my looking back over hundreds of posts, can you tell me which pairs to use, on top of the eur/usd and gbp/usd?  
  
Thanks

LOL wow do I have bad luck. Just closed all my Gbp/Usd buy orders at 2:13 pm E.S.T. taking a loss on all 4 of them because all indicators were pointing to a downward trend from what I could tell, 2 min later it shot up 150 pips. A 600 pip mistake! (took 400 pip loss on the 4 orders, all 4 would have hit the TP of 50)  
  
I am assuming there was a news release. Any of you get nailed with open GU sell orders here?  
  
Arghhhhh![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ps. Was I the only one who missed the pending drop in GBP/USD yesterday as well, lol? I guess I need to take my eyes off the Daily charts once in a while and switch down to the 4H, 1H.

Hi Samurai, so just to be clear you switched your EA for GU to "Short Only" based on the 4H indicator on the 17th? You did this despite Daily chart was still showing uptrend on the HA candle with no downward shadow, and the other Daily indicators were still pointing to an uptrend?   
  
Just seems as though maybe the 4H is the better indicator to base your decisions on. For the last 30 hours or so I kept my GU set to "long only" based on the Daily indicator, however if I had been basing my decision on the 4H I probably would have at least turned it off 1.5 days ago. This morning woke up with one SL hit and 4 others on the way down. Daily alone was pretty misleading on this one.  
  
Any thoughts?  
  
Thanks

Just closed all my Gbp/Usd buy orders at 2:13 pm E.S.T. taking a loss on all 4 of them because all indicators were pointing to a downward trend from what I could tell, 2 min later it shot up 150 pips. A 600 pip mistake! (took 400 pip loss on the 4 orders, all 4 would have hit the TP of 50)

Anyone have any suggestions how to react to new annoucements. I thought our Stoploss was for that purpose. My experience is that news announcements like employment numbers are reacted to but generally retrace like that of the GBP.  
  
I closed all my positions for a 400 pip loss as well. Should we wait for the next daily candle before we make that decision or just close them when the HA candle changes color even though it is just intra day change of color. As in the case of the GBP it was white then red then back to white. Any suggestions?

First I would to thank SamuraiPower for his insight and hard work into this system that has so far for me produced 700 + pips in just the last 3 days.  
I am using SamuriePower’s original version and have been running long on both the EUR/USD and GBP/USD. I do have one question Samurai  
Can you tell me what drives the EA to take the first trade when it is first activated. The reason I ask is because earlier this morning I shut the EA down anticipating what I thought may be a trend change .  
I have since re-started the EA (in the long position only) with a clean slate, but it has yet to place any trades…………..   
  
Again Thank You for the great work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi all, I think we would all agree the most difficult part of using this EA is determining when the trend is about to change. For example I am about to turn in for the night, I currently have the EA set to Long Only for EurUsd.  
  
What do you think judging from my 4H and 1H charts below? It the trend likely to change and go against me overnight? Very tough call. To be safe I kept my open long trades running but turned offf the Ea.  
  
What do you think?  
  
Thanks

Well I guess I got my answer this morning. EU and GU continued to shoot up another 130 pips. Missed out on some trades by turning off the EA but my open orders closed out for another 300pips  
  
Total of 1250 pips in 3.5 days on one of my demo accounts and 400 pips on the other (prematurely closed out some losses on this one)   
  
I think my strategy is going to be sticking with a trend until the 4H tells me otherwise. Can be a little scary when the 1H has been going the opposite way and you are leaving your computer for 6 hours but thems the breaks. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ps. Backtesting on tp=100, sl=300 seemed a bit more promising, so switched to that for now.

I second that, Daily chart alone seems to be a little dangerous, by the time there is a clear reversal the EA may have opened many positions in the wrong direction. 4H seems to provide a reliable indication without too many false signals.

Hi Samurai and others,  
  
I am new to this forum and I have read nearly all of this thread. It seems very sensible to only allow an EA to go with the trend.  
I have been working with forex for a while now and really want to get a system working.   
My weakness is computors. I have no problem putting on EA's into the folders and activating them and managing them, but when it comes to something more technical well I am lost.  
  
I have seen your page of 5 files to use. I tried to click and drag the firebird file into the experts folder, even though it does not look like a normal EXE file. It went in but then it does not go onto the platform. So I can't put it into a chart. I think maybe it needs something else.   
  
Please can somebody help me with these issues.  
  
Thanks

Hi there, welcome to the thread. I find the simplist thing to do is just right click whatever file you want to move, click copy then....  
  
Go into your Broker Folder on your computer, it is usually located here:  
  
**My Computer / Program Files / Your Broker eg.[FXPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile")/ Experts**  
  
once you are in the Experts Folder just right click and paste the EA and restart your Trading Platform, you should now find the EA on the left side bar under Expert Advisors. Either drag it onto your chart or right click and choose "Attach".  
  
If you want to add custome indicators paste them in here:  
  
**My Computer / Program Files / Your Broker/ Experts/ Indicators/**  
  
If you want to add in a template paste it here:  
  
**My Computer / Program Files / Your Broker / Templates**  
  
Hope that helped.  
  
Serge

I have been using the settings SL300 TP 50 and pipset 40. I had 250 pips today. Based on everyones posts here looks like I need to adjust my TP to 100. I am missing out on some good runs by taking profit at 50 pips. Keep up the posts it is really helping me...I too am monitoring the 4hr chart for possible trend reversals.  
  
I am using the THV system to monitor overbought and oversold conditions. The TRIX lines on the daily chart show that the EURUSD is getting close to the overbought terrritory (red dotted line see attached chart). Might be getting close to a trend reveral in the next few days.

I've read this thread too and will start using this method now. Looks like it's a good way to avoid the shortcomings of this EA.

Whats the consensus on Thursday / Friday trading with this EA.  
  
Are you generally:   
1) turning the EA off Thurs night / Friday morning and letting open positions ride until market re-opens on Sunday evening?   
2) Or are any of you taking the ultra conservative approach and turning off the EA and closing all open positions before close of trading on Friday regardless of whether they are positive or negative?  
  
I think I will be going for option #1 myself.

I turned mine off at the end of the london session on Thursday which is 17:00 GMT and will open up at the beginning of the Aisian session on Monday which is 8:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time or 0 GMT for me.   
  
I did not have any positions open at that time but I will close all at that time no matter what the profit or loss is.  
  
EURUSD trend ----  
  
Take a look at the EURUSD 4hr CHART. Price action is oversold and the TRIX line is showing red which means that the 4hr trend is weakening and could head down. The Daily chart is approaching a Major trend line. Will be cautious the next few days just in case of a trend reversal.

Eur USD seems to be trending upward (23:20 G.M.T.) but think it may be dangerous to turn on EA with "long only" at this point considering it is over bought.  
  
Any thoughts?

The 61.8% fib for the EUR is currently at 1.3810. Support is at 1.3414. I am going to see where we are at on Monday at Zero GMT at the beginning of the Aisian Market. If we are below that I will go long but will close trades once we get above that market to see if it will continue or retrace.

Hi there which indicator are you using for the Fib retrace levels? I am assuming you are viewing on the H1 charts?  
  
Thanks

Actually the 61.8 fib is the 1.3730. The 1.3812 is the 100% fib. Viewing it on the 1 or 4hr chart is easier to see.

Thanks for the help. I downloaded a Fib Pivot indicator, gives a nice visual of what is going on.  
  
How often do you find that it makes it to each of the fib levels in comparison to each other? Eg. how often does it reach the 100 fib, and how often does it reach the 61.8 fib?  
  
With my limited knowledge of Fib retrace I am guessing this is just another tool to help make an educated guess as to what the price is going to do next.  
  
Thanks

Usually Fibs are areas to Take profit and close your trade. The 38% 50% and 61.8 levels are retracement levels to take notice. The 38% being the most conservative and the 61.8* more optimistic. Beyond those points could me a change in the direction of the overall trend.

My Fib Pivot indicator has 3 Support lines and 3 Retracement lines, so I am assuming these are te 38%, 61.8%, and 100% ?  
  
Are you generally turning off your EA once it hits the 38% Fib Retrace or do you generally let it keep going until it shows signs reversing? GBP/USD just hit the 1st Resistance level.  
  
Thanks again

Regarding the fibs. Yes. resistance 1 38%, 2 61.8, 3 100%.   
  
I am using the THV system on the daily chart to watch for change in direction of the trend. Once the Trix indicator is overbought or oversold I will watch to see if the trix indicator changes color. i.e. from green to red or red to green. If it changes color or a major trendline is reached I will turn off the EA and close all trades for that pair.   
  
I also am following a free technical anaylsis website for forcasts on the currency pairs I am trading. Send me a PM and I will give you the link.

Namrettik,  
  
I'm driving this EA carefully as well at the moment with the AUSUSD and GBPUSD with TP=50. Up 300 pips since yesterday with those 2 pairs.  
  
Good advice on waiting for the trix indicator to change colour in OB/OS status.  
  
Are you using the THV Fib pivots indicator for your fib analysis?

Now I'm thinkin' to set TP to 150pips on GU, and adjust the SL once its open trades and after get some profit or even Set the TP and let it run to some spesific level like fibo and trend line, for me 50pips TP is too small and might lose chance to get higher profit.   
Sory guys I have trouble to reach u here, i still have computer trouble and internet connection since last week.

I cant speak for others but here's my thoughts, right now (13:20 E.S.T.) The Eur Usd is a little too unpredicatable for me as you will see from the Daily Chart the it is oversold and the last two trend bars have turned yello. I am sitting out on this and have closed my EurUsd postion.  
  
As for the GbpUsd (Chart 2) it is still going strong so still have it set to "long only". Mind you it has just recently crossed the 100% Fib so it could retrace as well, so should keep an eye on it.  
  
UsdCad is a little dicey right now, on the Daily it still showing a strong downtrend but on the 4H (chart 3) it is waffling a little. I am sticking with "short only" for now but keeping an eye on it.  
  
Hope this helps  
Serge

So far so good. 2500+ pips so far since I started using this system on March 15 (Statement attached) The market has been kind to us I think the last 7 days or so with nice long trends. Well see how it performs in the weeks ahead.

sergiel,  
  
Aamazing results! Mind giving out what version EA you are using, settings by pair, trading time, any other points of note for us to learn?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Reading trend is more discretionary to traders' judgement, but would be also nice if you would describe how you do.  
  
Went back and read your posts in the past weeks and seems to have grasped some of these points but not deeply enough, I think.  
  
Thanks in advance, RS

Hey All, yes I am using a Demo Account, here is basically what I am doing.  
  
I am using the v63H04 version with Max orders = 5  
  
I started using TP=100, SL = 300 about half way through, before that TP=50. Everything else is set to default.  
  
I am trading the EurUsd, GbpUsd, and UsdCad all the same way.  
  
Basically I am looking for the trend on the H4 and D1 charts using the THV indicators provided by Samurai.  
  
I would usually prefer waiting for a nice Heikin-ashi candle (without any shadow pointing in the opposite direction) on the D1 chart, as this is a pretty good indication that the trend is heading that way. I will also take a look at the H4 and see what has been going on for the previous 12 hours or so.  
  
As for the GbpUsd Short today, I have been basically using the H4 as my indicator.  
  
Sometimes if the D1 is showing a reversal with a yellow bar and cross configeration HA candle, I will scroll down to the H4 chart and the trend has been heading solidly in the reverse direction for 8 hours or more I will set the EA to trade accordingly. This one is a bit more risky as the D1 chart has not actually confirmed the reversal yet (yellow bar, and doesn't have decisive HA candle) but can be very profitable if the trend continues.  
  
I will probably get burned with this one sooner or later. For example right now I have a sell on the EurUsd that has a 100 pip downdraw. The reversal that began about 12 hours ago has been wavering.  
  
You will see that I closed a couple of my orders at -60 and -30 pips. I did this when it seemed clear that the trend I was following had come to an end based on the fib resistance level being hit, currency being oversold/overpurchased, and price reversing. Decided to cut my losses.  
  
Namrettik was kind enough to suggest using the Fib Pivot indicator which is also a good way to make an educated guess on how far a trend may go before a reversal.  
  
Hope this helps, and hopefully my results are not just a case of good luck so far, lol.

Thanks sergiel.  
  
Am using the original version on FXDD, IBFX and 121Sec., demo/live, on EurUsd, TP 50. "OnlyShort" since yesterday and still have 4 open positions due to the spike upward today. You only have 2 open EurUsd and with 100 TP! Hmm...   
  
I'll look into your version today. More pairs perhaps...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) RS

Great sergiel, keep up the good work...if you pack pips good enough, you should easly cover the looses that might accour.  
  
''New home sales'' news event kicked price for USD today, without that, 100-150 pips should be gained going short on Eur/Usd...

Hi Guys,  
I feel terribly sorry but I spent hours to read all the threads about the firebird EA and could not find anywhere the settings for the "SHORT ONLY' and LONG ONLY" trades. What inputs do I have to change ???  
Thanks a lot for your help, as I feel very frustrated....

lol I had the same problem when I first started using.  
  
open the EA properties and go to the Common tab and you will find a pull down menu that allows "long & short", "long only" or "short only" trades.

this is a great system. i'm testing it since about 2 weeks and it has produced only winning trades.   
as far as the eur/usd is concerned: do you guys are still "long only" in this pair?   
the h4 chart seems to be sideways since days, the d1 still going up.  
  
p.s. i will start testing it on a live account and will post the results here.

Nice sergiel fren. Thats exactly what i'm doing, u know this really well now.  
  
Let me give U guys a simple illustration for easy understanding.  
Imagine that the EA is your car, and the indicators is a GPS reciever.  
  
U drive the car based on the GPS signal, weather it turns right, left or straight. But sometimes when u find an intersection on the street the GPS is not giving u a clear signal, that makes u feel doubt on taking the right direction. So U stop your car and wait untill the GPS gives u a clear signal again. That will cost u time a bit to reach your destination, but it will save u from wasting lots of time if u take the wrong direction.  
This is exactly the same, knowing when to stop for a while is an important thing also.

The behaviour and character of the EA that sergiel using is the same with the EA im using, but sergiel version is more complete than mine, it has Max Order option and Trailling Stop option, the basic principe is not change, I might need it, and maybe lots of viewer here need the fascility also, so now i'm gonna change Sergiel EA into my default EA i'm using, and i'm gonna attach it on the first post.  
so prc, u can dowload it there ini a minute..

Apprecite the prompt resonse, Rising Sun. Agreed, there is little difference between the original but this allows me a couple of options I didn't have. In my short term trading, I use Swiss Army for trailing stops and found it to be miles better than the MT4 default.  
  
Currently standing aside while the GBP and EUR decide on direction. My trading partner decided that the trends were set and had his lunch handed to him today (yesterday, now). I reminded him to look back at the daily chart for the EUR last big move up to see that it took 12 days to feel safe with shorting the pair.

Hi Guys,  
  
I have been testing this for exactly one week (5 trading days) and have had fabulous success.  
  
On demo, 54 trades ALL successful.  
  
Starting deposit: $1000  
New balance: $3500  
Open trades: -$200  
  
Settings:   
SL 300  
TP 50  
  
Pairs:  
EUR/USD  
GBP/USD  
AUD/USD  
USD/CHF  
USD/CAD  
  
The only downside is that, at one stage, the drawdown was over $1000... scary stuff. If this had happened near the beginning, it would have wiped me out.  
  
Any suggestions to reduce this risk? Maybe change to version with the max trades option? Maybe trade fewer pairs? On the other hand, often the high number of open trades and number of different pairs tend to even things out, some being negative and others being positive at any one time.  
  
Any comments and advice, Samurai and everybody? I obviously want to go live soon!

I used the daily chart and the H4 and even H1 for confirmation. If in any doubt, I turned off the ea for the "doubtful" pair until the trend became clearer again. Apart from that I did not interfere at all with the trading (no manual closing trades).  
  
All pairs had their ups and down. I haven't had time to analyze the details yet.  
  
Hope this helps.

Good Job! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Using more pairs has produced 350% in a few days of trading, that is impressive. Downdraw is always a concern with this system as sometimes it may take a while for the price to move as expected.   
  
Right now (nearing the end of the London session) the EurUsd is dropping like a stone, it is taking alot of dicipline to stay out, lol. There is no clear indication on the H4 or D1 chart. On the bright side I do have an open EU sell order from yesterday so hopefully will make a few pips there.  
  
Keep up the good work all, and post your technique / results so we can all learn from each other. And thanks again Samurai for taking the time to share this great system!

Wow thats great, but make sure u drive it correctly, understanding how to take a descicion on difficult time is very important, carefull for the drawdown that might occur in early of trading, spescially when your deposit is minimum. This is a powerful tool ( I think), knowing how to handle the trend as cruscial part is the key to get all the good pips in this universe. Good luck.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Jonda,  
  
Loss is happening in every trading system, but if u are using this system correctly then I would say drawdown like this.  
"Would U like to give the market $5,000 from your pocket to get $20,000 back into your pocket?"  
  
The EA version with "Max Order" option and "Trailing Stop" option is in the first post. Thx to sergiel to bring this up.

Samurai Power

Hi Samurai...  
  
Thanks for sharing this method. I'm going to use it and I downloaded the new version you just posted on page 1, but it doesn't have a Trailing Stop option. It does have the Max Open Orders. Am I missing something?

Hi there, all versions of Firebird can be found here: [http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4...a-archives.htm](http://www.accrete.com/fx-mirror/mt4-firebird/ea-archives.htm)  
  
The V63H04 has max orders but no TS. The V63H04-TS has both.  
  
I have to be honest not really sure how the trailing stop is supposed to work with this EA. I suppose if your position initially has some drawdown but then starts to come back up it will pull your SL up. Not really sure how well it will work with this system but be interesting if one of us tests it out.

If you don't close trades manually and the trend has truely reversed then you will hit your stoploss mostlikely. I would like to have other opinions on this from the thread readers how you are handling your trades i.e. closing them manually etc.

Thanks Sergiel...  
  
With other FB versions, the TS works like this: If you have TS = 30, and your trades don't go the full TP, it will take you out at +25 pips profit. If the TS = 40, it will take you out at +35 pips profit. It worked well for me with a TP = 50 and TS = 40, so if the price didn't make it to 50, at least I would get 35 pips, and not risk reversing and going into a death hang for days.   
  
With the Drive method however, it may be a moot point.

Hey Namrettik, I cant speak for others, but generally if I have an open order and it seems like the price can still go either way based on the D1 & H4 chart for 1) HA Candles, 2) Fib levels, 3) THV trend bar then I will let it ride. Oviously if these give me a solid indication that I am on the wrong side of a strongly developing trend I will close them.  
  
Today I strayed from my rules and it cost me. I prematurely closed my 2 GbpUsd Short trades at 1.4533 with a profit of +65 and +25 . If I would have left them alone they would have both hit my 100 TP. The GU signal was inconclusive at that point so I should have left them alone.

If the TS = 40, it will take you out at +35 pips profit. It worked well for me with a TP = 50 and TS = 40, so if the price didn't make it to 50, at least I would get 35 pips, and not risk reversing and going into a death hang for days.

so how would it work if I had my tp = 100, sl=300 and ts = 40  
as soon as I am in profit by 40pips would it move the sl to my entry price, or just creep up my original SL by 40 pips?  
  
Thanks

I agree 100% the way you are looking at it. I too let them ride until I see a clear trend developing. I was long of the GBP monday and part of tuesday when I turned the EA off for the GBP until I could determine where it was going. I saw a clear downside trend developing this morning(i.e. price action trading below the daily pivot, the trix on the THV system had turned red and the price was trading below the 21 MA so I decided to close the GBP trades as they were. If I had left them going until the time of this post I would have had an additional 150 pips loss and be closing in on the stoploss on one of the trades.  
  
When you get to the end of a trend you will have to make those decisions or be willing to lose your entire stoploss. On three trades I was out for 340 pips loss. If I left the trades going to the stoplosses that would be a total of 900 loss. I would rather take the 340 loss and make it up once the trend was certain again.   
  
Any thoughts....

I've got FB v63H04 installed on EUR/USD - short only - and there's a message on the chart saying... "Trades enabled. Not safe to trade." A few other pairs have this message too, while other say Safe to trade.  
  
I just got a down arrow on the 4 hour chart for EUR/USD too.  
  
Any suggestions/comments?

Apparently there are several ways that a TS will work, and FB's implementation isn't standard, as far as I can tell. It doesn't work the way you describe, which is the way I thought it would too.  
  
Test it on a demo trade and you'll see.

Questions if you please...  
  
I've installed FB v63H04, and the default setting for Percent is .05, which has something to do with the frequency of trades, ie: smaller = more trades. The default for many other FB versions has been .1. What is everyone here using for that setting?  
  
Also, this version of FB has the option for 4 different time ranges, ie: Start & Finish. Should I leave these at 0 or what?  
  
BTW, the EUR/USD chart now says, "Safe to Trade". Go figure.  
  
Thanks!

I'm using a 0.1 Percent, which is a little more conservative I guess. I left those other settings at default.

Hi all,  
I've been demoing for a week now but yet to understand the condition under which the order is triggered although I see the place/timing is spot on, at the peaks (short) or troughs (long) on the 5 min chart or at the reversal points beautifully.  
  
If I could read the code, I would know but unfortunately I have to rely on the people who can.  
  
Also, the "Percent" number of 0.1 or 0.05 .... would this setting have to do with the order trigger condition? If so, how?  
  
Samurai, sergiel, mac109 and/or anyone, please.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Sorry Im not much help in this regard, as I have know idea of what is going on internally in the program besides that it trades at a pullback in a trend.  
  
The Percent - basically the higher the number the more conservative and less trades it makes.  
  
I found a small manual on the Firebird on the net and have attached it.

I already have this manual and mine does not have pics either. Hopefully someone can post one with pics......

Namrettik,  
  
Samurai's default is 300 pips, which is in agreement with the 4 steps trade example and this is what has been explained in a post here. To me 100 pips is too small and above 300 too much. This should have to do with the volatility of the pair you are trading, I think. Not much help but just my thoughts.  
  
It seems I found the answer to "Percent" there in the manual, although the explanation there does not really suggest any level with reasons. So I would just go with the default 0.1 for now.  
  
The "MA_timeframe" section presents some contradiction to Samurai's explanation and default setting of 15 on a 5 min chart, since the manual says:  
  
_\- MA_timeframe Put the number of minutes here of the chart you are using. 10 for M10 charts, 1440 for D1 charts, etc. Just use the number that matches your chart unless you want to do some testing._  
  
Should I follow this manual's guideline or Samurai's way as to leave it at 15?  
  
If this influences the entry point decision to a high degree, we cannot overlook but otherwise I would follow the master Samurai's opinion...  
  
What are your thoughts?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Does this chart mean if we are trading with a $300 stoploss we should only have 4 positions open?  
what does this mean. 1 lot per $1000 (is this per mini lot)  
  
Below a list of how many pips drawdown you get:  
1 position: 30 pips  
2 positions: 90 pips  
3 positions: 180 pips  
4 positions: 300 pips  
5 positions: 450 pips  
6 positions: 630 pips  
7 positions: 840 pips  
8 positions: 1080 pips  
9 positions: 1350 pips  
10 positions: 1650 pips  
And that's excluding the $1000 it takes to buy 1 lot.  
So if you want to trade 10 positions you need to set the stoploss at 1650+29=1679 pips.  
That's $16790 drawdown plus $10000 for buying the lots. Total $26790 account needed

This should have to do with the volatility of the pair you are trading, I think. Not much help but just my thoughts.

I kept the default. I too wondered about changing it to 5 but read other posts along the way to leave it at the default. I am not sure how this works.

@Namrettik,  
  
Well, it's not $300 but it is 300 pips. This is the area of breath or allowance of pullback. And 4 positions per pair at the most (maximum) simultaneously is plenty enough for me in terms of both anticipated profit, and the burden of funds - a scarly degree when trend goes against, imho.  
  
This manual assumes a 100:1 leverage where 1.0 "standard" lot requires $1,000 funds or margin. If leverage is 200:1, the requirement will be $500. And if you are trading 0.1 lot, $50. If 0.01 lot, $5 margin. If 0.001 "nano" lot (ibfx mini account 0.01 lot), $0.5 margin. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f644.png?v=15.1)This calculation is subject to correction (anyone please).  
  
As for the JPY pairs, I have only traded EurUds up to now. It's only a week's experience.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I did mean pips not dollars......I am trading .1 of full lots or 1 pip equal $1. Sorry for the confusion.

Yeah I know what you mean. As of now the only USD pair with an opportunity is the USDJPY. Do you know if Firebird can trade the pair.

The default is 0 = close; you have 1 =high/low - why did you change to this setting

The manual says:  
_  
MA_type  
\- Type 0 calculates its bands using the current bars open.  
\- Type 1 uses previous bars high for the upper band and previous bars low for the lower band.   
\- Type 1 trades a little less that Type 0 but it's entries are usually closer to the reversal point.  
\- So:Type 0: More less certain trades.Type 1: Little less trades that are more certain. With better potential for trailing stops._  
  
What are you referring to when you say; 0=close, 1=high/low?

Last year I was analysing the EA with many different setting, and i was just backtest it again but still I think MA_timeframe set to 15 is more optimum.

Hello Samurai Power,  
  
Many thanks for taking time to back test again... Yes, I actually put 5 today as test on one of 5 min charts EurUsd and observed an entry, and the result was an entry at a strange point = too early before reaching optimum point by the looks, and while it is just a short trial, I tend to second your test results to set it at 15, even on 5 min chart.  
  
Regarding the MA_type and Incrrement type, which I set at 1 and 0.2 after reading the manual, I would appreciate your thoughts very much. Your setting is: 0 and 0, respectively as I recall.  
  
Thanks in advance.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) RS

The EA can trade JPY pair also but less trade, so I dont trade JPY.  
I found GBP, EUR, USD, CAD, CHF, AUD, are the optimum pair with this EA.  
But gasgas attached the EA for JPY pair somewhere around in this thread wich I havent test it, u guys may check it out and test it.  
  
There are no differerent on behaviour and character between, Firebird v63G traderseven, Firebird v63H04 and Firebird v63H04-TS, the only different are:

  1. Firebird v63G traderseven: No "Ma Order" and "Trailing Stop" fascility
  2. Firebird v63H04 : has "Ma Order", but no "Trailing Stop" fascility
  3. Firebird v63H04-TS: has both "Ma Order" and "Trailing Stop" fascility

I went first live acc on Mar 2008, after almost 1.5 year learning and observing forex, no spesific trading system, no emotional preparation, and bla..bla...,all I know that I was good on demo with other people trading system, but then I blew my acc, and that happens twice. Newbie syndrome I guess.  
  
Redeposit again after I learn this EA, but I had a little "roller coaster" experience in early trading using this system due to minimum deposit, I didnt have space to breathe, thats why I recommed to u guys having enough deposit and get the feel first before jump to live.  
Then I took a little bit conservative style untill now by taking trades only several times a month worth my monthly salary ha..ha.., and i think doubling my real acc in 2.5 month is not bad. No trading for quite some times coz my PDA is still on reparation, I have no tools to control my VPS while i'm out for work, and setting up my small company drains my energy, so no trading while i have no space left on my brain. Overall i am satisfied with the result.  
  
Just want to show u guys the potensial of the EA, I only took a part of the potensial, for u guys having enough deposit, time and the feel to this system then u have enough space to breathe and gain more profitable result. Cheers  
  
Regards,

I guess you guys didn't see by post about jpy fix version, so I attached it again. Try trading Gbp/Jpy, with this version, its good pair to trade with Firebird, only [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are little higher.

Hi all, just finished reading this great thread and thanks to Samurai for starting it and to everyone for all the hard work done with this very interesting EA.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Sergiel,  
I'm interested to see you are using an increasement value; I would see this variable as being useful for preventing too many orders being placed in the 'wrong' direction if the trend reverses against the user (when both long and short orders are used) whilst Max Orders controls the total live orders placed.  
As we are driving the EA, our oders are all placed on the retracement and total orders are controlled by Max Order variable so I'm curious as to why you see this as necessary with this method?  
My back testing agrees that MA tf = 5 & MA type = 1 seems to be the optimised settings but I've only done this on G/U & E/U, my favourite pairs. 

You don't have to be right, just don't be too wrong

Is the max orders (per) currency pair or total orders for all charts open with the ea running on them. Also, if increasement is set to zero, does that mean that the increasement feature is off.

I was refering to the programming text within the EA. I opened up the EA with the editor and this is what is written.  
  
extern int MA_length = 10;  
extern int MA_timeframe = 15; // hdb did I add this ? lol  
extern int MAtype = 0; //0=close, 1=HL   
extern double Percent = 0.05;  
extern int TradeOnFriday = 1; // >0 trades on friday  
  
I assumed it meant close- when candle closed vs High/low of the candle. I don't know for sure was just asking.

In the Firebird manual it states that if Increasement is set to Zero then it just uses Pipstep.  
I assume (but would be glad if someone knows for sure) that max orders is just for the chart that the EA is loaded on

I am wanting to know what setting most is using for the Divergence Limit Setting. The default for the V63G is .005 and the default for the V63H is .002.  
  
use 63D_Divergence is set to True on the V63G default and set to False on the V63H04 version. What does this mean and how does it affect the EA.

Max order is the maximum open order per pair, I think its nescesary to prevent continuing open order when u against the market.  
If increasement is set to zero, it means that the increasement feature is off.  
Not sure bout Ma_type but all I know the result is like this.  
  
Backtest for 1 month period on Aug 2008, GBPUSD pair, TP 100pips, short only, other setting is default  
  
MA timeframe = 15  
Ma type = 0  
Result: 3009pips  
  
MA timeframe = 15  
Ma type = 1  
Result: less than 3009pips  
  
MA timeframe = 5  
Ma type = 0  
Result: less than 3009pips  
  
MA timeframe = 5  
Ma type = 1  
Result: less than 3009pips

Dont know for sure, I just pick the setting wich gives better result, i set it to "true"  
  
Backtest for 1 month period on Aug 2008, GBPUSD pair, TP 100pips, short only, other setting is default  
  
Divergence Limit = 0.005  
Result: 3009pips  
  
Divergence Limit = 0.002  
Result: 2170pips

Overall my setting never change. I'll try to put my set file on my first post so u only have to upload it without setting the parameter one by one. Since we cant upload set file in this forum so I'm gonna compress it in zip file, hopefully there will be no problem.

Thanks for the clarification. I didn't notice there was such a note (//0=close, 1=HL )in the source. Besides, I am not a programmer and so I don't understand most of the code ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f612.png?v=15.1)...  
  
However, 0=close (of last bar) usually equals to open of current bar. So these two expressions should be understood to mean the same thing. And 1=HL means high and low of last bar. Thus the manual and the note in the program should be interpreted to mean the same thing:  
  
_MA_type  
\- Type 0 calculates its bands using the current bars open.  
\- Type 1 uses previous bars high for the upper band and previous bars low for the lower band.   
\- Type 1 trades a little less that Type 0 but it's entries are usually closer to the reversal point.  
\- So:Type 0: More less certain trades.Type 1: Little less trades that are more certain. With better potential for trailing stops._  
  
Hope I am right...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) RS

Thanks for the insight. I will experiment with both of them. I have been using the setting = 0 so far with good results.

I guess every backtest period will generate different results:  
G/U from 11/3/09 - 20/3/09 (which includes a trend reversal period)  
Divergence set to 'False': 1891 pips  
Div 'True' and set to 0.002: 1554pips  
Div 'True' and set to 0.005: 1397pips  
  
I suppose as the market changes, optimum settings will constantly change too.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi guys,  
  
I trade the eur/usd alot and watch the gbp/usd. dont like to trade both @ the same time do to very similar moves and i feel it just increase to risk if i am wrong. The last few days has been in a range. up and down, almost wasnt sure which way it would go although my bias was down and now it has done that. My question was. Was the range making it more difficult to drive this ea? The top i believe was last week. so have you guys been driving this thing down the whole time? what were your results?  
  
Been thinking about this as i was placing my own trades on my system which is similar to what the ea does, but of course i have human emotion and change my mind or make adjustments as i go. Thanks for any feedback....  
  
  
bulls  
  
also i thought this was worth reading.....  
  
Congressman Peter DeFazio introduced H.R. 1068: “Let Wall Street Pay for Wall Street's Bailout Act of 2009” on 13February2009. This bill imposes a 0.25% transaction tax on the “value of the sale and purchase of financial instruments such as stock, options, and futures contracts.” While HR1068 seeks to engender populist appeal by ostensibly exacting monetary retribution against the big Wall Street firms for wreaking havoc upon the American financial system, its effects will hurt EVERY American who trades professionally as well as the ordinary investor trying to save for the future. The 0.25% tax is invoked against the VALUE of every purchase AND sale of typical financial instruments, resulting in an egregious added cost borne by every American for each investment or trading transaction they make, even within the realm of an IRA or 401K account. It is particularly grievous that this tax is imposed upon the transaction itself, regardless of whether the purchase / sale generates a profit. The bill will have virtually no effect upon the behavior of the relatively few Wall Street executives whose reckless decisions contributed to the current financial crisis, as added costs would in all likelihood be passed on in some form to customers. Further, the bill would have the effect of diminishing capital provision, as it discourages investment to a degree even beyond the negative impact of capital gains taxation.

Thats for sure!!! Some pairs are not tradable sometimes a month or so. Some are every day. Just find best avarage settings for pairs you trade and stick with that..

Not being a programmer I am a little hesitant in posting this but.....I think that MA Type refers to the type of MA as follows:  
0= Simple  
1= Exponential  
2= Smoothed  
3= Weighted  
On what the MA is calculated I don't know. Most MA's are calculated on the closing price of the bar but there are other options also. Hope this helps.  
  
I follow this thread with interest and have learned a great deal from it. Thanks Samurai and others.

Helo, very good questions. I actually never gave alot of thought to how the increasement would work with the "Driving" method. I just had a gut feeling that it was better to have a somewhat exponential pipstep as opposed to a straighy linear pipstep. I suppose the need for this is reduced when you are "Driving" the EA, however sometimes the price can make big a big retrace quickly and I think this setting will help it find the real bottom/top of a pullback. But I could be completely wrong.  
  
And in regards to max orders, I believe Samurai is correct, it will only set the max orders for that particular pair, not for all currencies running on your platform. So if you are trading 3 pairs you could still have 15 open orders at once. I am considering dropping this setting to 4 or maybe even 3. I think by the time it opens 5 orders in the wrong direction its safe to say there is a trend developing in the wrong direction and not just a pullback.  
  
Cheers

I would review post #1 to answer your questions. I use the THV system to confirm the trend. I marked the entry and exit of an uptrend on the EURUSD. The red is the entry and the exit is the yellow verticle line. If you need a link to the THV system send me a PM.  
  
The daily chart candle changes at different times for different brokers. IBFX changes at 0 GMT time.

I would strongly suggest that you see which way the trend is going before placing a trade. This has a tendency to save you money.

Hi all,  
I've been thinking about how to remove judgement (emotion) from the process of pulling the trigger on the EA and when to switch it off again.  
On the THV template it would be very straightforward to switch the EA on in Short only mode when the daily bar opens below the Ichimoku cloud and switch the EA off on the first bar that touches it again, opposite applies to a bar opening clear above the cloud.  
I have backtested for 2008 & 2009 to date using this rule and the results are attached.  
In summary:  
2008 - 23580 pips  
2009 - 8907pips  
The real results, with a few additional rules and understanding of candle price action should be better than the backtest results as no account was taken of weekends; backtest periods ran from the opening of the first candle clear of a cloud to the first candle that fully breached the cloud (see chart) - in reality, price action and proximity to the cloud would give good indication to stop new trades being placed by the EA before the trend reversal hit.  
I'm not too familiar with the Ichimoku cloud and don't know if it repaints but watching it today would have been a no trading day on G/U.  
I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on this as the results look promising with manageable drawdowns and the EA would be 'live' for most of the time.  
  
Backtest SL: 300, TP 75, MA type 1, MA TF 5, Max open trades 5  
Other settings default

Man I wish I had more open short EU and BU before I went to bed last night. I awoke this morning to find that the Euro had dropped about 200 pips.   
  
I had one open short EU but I had the TP set to 50 instead of 100 before going to bed. I did this because the EU was very inconsistent for the better part of Wednesday and Thursday and wanted to grab any profit I could just in case it shot back up toward the support Fib levels.  
  
Once again I strayed from the rules and it cost me 50 pips, ah well.  
  
Good weekend all!

What settings are we using for this indicator. I have the metatrader platform running on a VSP and have the settings.  
  
fasterema 5  
slowerema 8  
  
On my laptop I have   
  
fasterema 1  
slowerema 2  
  
I seemed to have downloaded two different version. Did I get one of them by misstake....I assume based on the name it should be fasterema 5 slower ema 8  
  
I do remember some discussion of 1 ema and 2 ema but I think that was when someone was trying to program the ea to be automatic instead of being maually traded.

eldee,  
yup....the max order is just for the chart that the ea is loaded.  
i.e - max order for GU - 4;max order for EU 4 - in total it becomes 8

Most of the time I set   
fasterema 1  
slowerema 2  
  
But sometimes if I want to filter choppy market I set  
fasterema 5  
slowerema 8  
  
for a while.

So have most of you been found the 15M MA timeframe to give you better entry points? I am assuming you are using the matching chart? Eg. MA timeframe set to M15, on the M15 chart?

I asked Samurai the same question several posts back, since the manual suggested the matching timeframe but his default was a non-mathing set-up, and he has said non-maching MA timeframe gives better entry point and better results; 15 on M5 charts.  
  
I have experienced a seemingly immature entry when I tested 5 on M5 chart. After changing to 15 on M5 chart the entry point was right on the pull back point. This is for EurUsd...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) RS

Is too simple read my indicators:  
Xpma it's a simple MA, but you can select MA type and MA period, (on my chart is set to 21, like original template) when trend changes, color of MA changes and has alert.  
ADX crosses are the arrows on my chart, only show the crosses of Average Directional Movement Index (Standard metatrader indicator), and shows changes of trend too, (For me its better than MA crosses, less signals but more accurate).  
Aroon indicator its a great tool to detect trend changes, This indicatos has two lines (on my chart blue and red), when blue its above red indicates a uptrend, when red above blue downtrend, more separate the lines, more strong is the trend.  
You can learn more about Aroon on this link   
[http://www.investopedia.com/articles...g/06/Aroon.asp](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/Aroon.asp)  
  
I need a alert on aroon crosses because i'm trading 10 pairs at the same time, and its the key of my system. (i only trade on aroon crosses, if the rest of indicators are in agreement, and always in the direction of the major trend).  
Last night i added a silvertrend indicator set to weekly timeframe to detect major trend.  
I atach silvertrend indicator and screenshot of my template.  
Rules are:  
1- Aroon cross.  
2- Confirmation with ADX, Heiken hansi and Xpma.  
3- Never enter long when Silvertrend (set to weekly timeframe -10080-) are red, and viceversa.  
Is a stress less system, I only need be alerted when Aroon changes, then see if the rest of indicators are in agreement.  
  
Hope this help.

I am still backtesting. So far the 15 on the M5 chart is the best performance.

Hi I downloaded the latest one. Looked in Metrader daily chart. From the 11th March 09 to the 24th March 09 there is a clear up-trend. (gbpusd) So I backtested in 15min chart and also 5min chart and both made a couple hundred loss at 1 lot. The 30 min chart made over 4 grand profit but in another clear trending period made a loss!  
  
_Net Profit trading 1 lot 10th to 24th March Long Trades Only_  
5 min: -985.80  
15min: -238.20  
30min: **5393.00**  
1 hour: 40.60  
  
From the 26th Jan 09 to the 30th Jan 09 there is another clear up-trend.  
  
_Net Profit trading 1 lot 26th to 30th January Long Trades Only_  
5 min: **1710.00**  
15min: -550.00  
30min: -110  
1 hour: 12.40  
  
It seems this is a bit unstable and I wouldn't trust it with real money I don't think..

I have been backtesting a way to consistantly enter and exit trades while driving the Firebird EA using the THV3 Trend Indicator to confirm the beginning and end of the trend. There are going to be times that the market will change to yellow(flat) then back again to the trend but if you exit consistantly you should not have as much drawdown.  
  
I marked a few entry and exit points. Green verticle line entry and red verticle line exit.   
  
Rules:  
  
Long Entry - Enter on second green bar if in long position and then exit on next bar after a yellow or red bar forms. Heiken Ashi must be white to enter. (the exit is always at the change of the daily candle)  
  
Short Entry - Enter on second red bar if in short position and then exit on next bar after a yellow or green bar forms. Heiken Ashi must be red to enter. (the exit is always at the change of the daily candle)  
  
Please backtest and give me your input. I am trying to keep this simple and limit drawdowns when the trend changes.  
  
Note the 1/2/09 entry was not on the second bar because of the holiday on 1/1/09.

Hi, looks interesting. When you say Long Entry or Short Entry - are these the only days on which you are allowed to enter trades or are you saying between the entry and exit signals the EA is switched on in the direction of the trend (ie. you leave the EA running for as long as you are in this upward or downward trend). If it is the latter, do you forcefully close the trades or do you just leave open whatever is open at that time?  
  
I will see if this can be automated,

All the indicators go into your "inidicators" folder which you can find by looking:  
  
My Computer / Program Files / Your Broker / Experts / Indicators  
  
The template needs to go in the templates folder  
  
My Computer / Program Files / Your Broker / Templates  
  
Restart your platform, open a chart, go to templates, and open the THV template, should be good to go.  
  
The EA is something different, your EA needs to go in the experts folder, then you find it on the left bar under Expert advisors and attach it to your chart. I find it best to open 2 charts for each currency pair. One for the EA alone and one for all the template / indicators.  
  
Hope this helps

I will turn on the EA on the entry then turn off and close the trades at the exit. I will let it run over the weekend if I do not get a signal to close by friday. Those are the only days it will be on. Like Samurai said you may only trade part of the month.

Hi Samurai, so it seems as thought the M5 is getting the best results on these periods of trading. Are you using matching chart with the MA timeframe, eg. MA = 5 on the M5 chart?   
  
Thanks again  
Serge

Hi Serge,  
  
Nope, EA on 5M and still i set 15 on Ma timeframe.   
My setting might not be the most optimum according to other, but this is the optimum setting for me. U may use your own setting I guess.  
The market is change but the major thing on how adapting to the market changing is how to drive the EA, coz no matter what the setting is the EA will keep opening trade, so lets improove the skill on driving the EA, shall we...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Thanks again, I am going to set the EA up on another broker demo and run exactly the same way but I will use the 5M setting on the 15 M chart. I'll let you know how it goes.

Samurai power, I must confess, this EA really works. I have been testing it with the settings you provided on [FxPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile"), IBFX and windsor platforms and it has made a lot of pips almost dubbling the account (Demo account). This Ea is almost making no loss, the only loss i experienced for the past 3 weeks is on the IBFX platform and that was last Friday. But the EA has a lot of drawdowns. For now, I'm going to run it for another one or two weeks before putting it to a live account, but I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU, this is the first EA I used that has generated profit consistently for 3 weeks. Do you or anybody know a very good platform i can open a live account with?.   
  
Thanks again.  
Ayo.

Have you completed? Is MA timeframe: 15 on M5 chart still the best?   
  
Have you ever tested the fixed vs. variable step? RS

Hey Rising, I have always been using MA = 5 on the M5 Chart, and will continue running that test, but plan on trying Samurai's setting of MA = 15 on the M5 chart and see how it compares, driving both exactly the same way.  
  
How are you currenlty running it?  
  
Thanks  
Serge

Morning Serge! Yes, I am from Tokyo, where it's a nice Sunday morning 6 am.  
  
I followed Samurai's 15 on M5 chart since start (just a week now) but did test the 5 on M5 chart and found this latter setting made premature entries compared with the former. So I am at this moment convinced with 15 on M5 chart. Pls let me/us know your comparison run results.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) RS

Hey Namrettik,  
  
Was it more or less consistent each month?  
  
Which version of Firebird?

Really? I had the complete opposite results.  
  
For Jan 2, 2009 - March 27, 2009  
  
Tp = 100, Sl = 200 (automatic) +4277 pips  
  
Tp = 100, Sl = 300 (automatic) +5727 pips  
  
Tp = 100, Sl = 300 (manual driving) +8281 pips  
  
My other settings were the same as I discussed in previous threads except I used an MA timeframe of 15 on the M5 chart.  
  
Is there anything else you may have done differently in your backtests?

How are you SamuraiPower   
  
Prompt "excessive loss" only to appear on the true account, the use of simulated test account, and will not prompt a loss of more "excessive loss". If you are prompted to "excessive loss" EA to stop trading, (my English is poor)

Hey Namrettic, I just drove the Ea for each uptrend or downtrend on the backtest. It would just close all orders at the end of each period (change in trend).  
  
Eg March 11 - 25 set it to "long only" so it closes all open orders on March 25th. Sometimes this results in a loss at the end. So this type of testing assumes that I am closing all orders when the trend changes on the Daily and not letting them hit the SL (which is what I have been doing generally in real time).  
  
I was using V63Ho4.  
  
I am fairly certain Samurai had similar results in his backtests, "Driving" the EA was clearly more profitable then letting it do its' thing on auto pilot.  
  
It would be a heck of alot easier for us all if that wasn't the case ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi all! Read tread today! Find everything very promising.  
Nemretik you say  
Short Entry - Enter on second red bar if in short position and then exit on next bar after a yellow or green bar forms. Heiken Ashi must be red to enter. (the exit is always at the change of the daily candle)  
Second red bar, at the start or the end of the bar?  
I use IBFX and new bars start 0 GMT. At the end of fridays trading there whas 2 red bars. Is the entry sunday when market open? Or friday sometime?

Here is a variation for Aroon, ADX signals, xpMA and SilverTrend. I think it is better use on H4 with MTF Aroon set to D1 and MTF SilverTrend set to W1.  
  
As for myself, I prefer Aroon oscillator. You can change the Filter level and so the sensitivity of the indicator.  
  
Next week I try out how it works.  
  
Cheers,

I studied many 4 hour charts to look for major reversal points, and I've noticed that a majority of big price reversals take place at the 8 am candle close EST, ie: the NY market opening, which is also after lunch in London/Europe, one of the most active times in the market.  
  
The 2nd biggest turnaround point is the London open, or the 4 am EST candle close.   
  
I also use an RSI 3 to show me the wave strength of the price and when it is over bought or over sold, implying a potential reversal.  
  
Just some food for thought and observation.

i install the FB v63H04-TS and change some parameters like recommand  
in this tread.  
  
But it have some i don't know what to do.  
  
  
min margin 250  
trade from 1 = 0  
trade until 1 = 24  
trade from 2 = 0  
trade until 2 = 0  
trade from 3 = 0  
trade until 3 = 0  
trade from 4 = 0  
trade until 4 = 0  
safe area = 40  
  
Like the min Margin, if open live with $300 probably set it to 0 ?  
  
Is it really important to set the GMT at exacly the broker GMT time?  
  
thank you

One more thing...  
  
I learned this technique from a manual system I studied. When a trade is around 50 pips in profit, and all other indications show that it's not likely that it will reverse, I set the SL to the entry price + 1, so if it does reverse, I'll get stopped out and still make 1 pip.   
  
But more important is that it means that this trade is now 100% safe and running on bank money, so you can now turn on the EA on another trending pair to take an additional trade without increasing your risk, ie: you still only have 1 trade at risk.   
  
I've seen many instances where there are multiple simultaneous trends, so this should be a viable concept.

Hey whatever works for each of us and what we feel comfortable with. Myself last two weeks have had pretty incredible results from Samurai's system just the way it is, so for me "if it aint broke dont fix it." I can't hope for much better than 100% return in 7 trading days, so well see how it goes in the weeks ahead.  
  
I have a feeling the Euro & Gbp are going to coninue their downward progression when markets open back up, what do the rest of you think?

Hi sergi,  
  
With all the wisdom of participants here, am looking forward to my second week EurUsd. My reading is for "only short".

Does anyone have an Heiken Ashi Alert to use on our daily chart that would alert when the candles change color. i.e. from red to white or white to red? This would be great to program to send alert to cell phone and popup sound alert on your computer. This way you would get notified when the candle is changing color and can make a judgement call to drive EA in opposite direction.

Samurai do you still avoid trading on Mondays and what was your reason for that? I wonder if anyone else has experienced less than desirable results driving this EA on Mondays. Would be nice to get some feed back.

Hi Jayman02,  
  
its only my judgement based on GBPUSD pair only, I got hit on monday several times but luckily not all of them on my live acc, some on my demo, I just had i little trauma.  
I have no idea if u still running it on other pair or GU on monday it might give u a good result if u find its better.

I have no idea bout that one, but i let it default coz the way it trades is still similar with the previous EA I posted, maybe others can help.

Hi Samurai,  
  
I am testing the original system on a real account, with micro lots. It's the first day, it seems very promising now... trend decision with THV v3...  
  
My question:  
If I set a trailing stop (in my case it's 500, 5 digit broker), should I have to see it in the order list? Because it is already over +50 pips now, but the SL is still the -300 value...  
  
Is trailing stop invisible? Or is it only for the trades which were opened after setting the TS value?  
  
  
Anyway, one of the best systems I tried in the near past...:-)

> Does anyone have an Heiken Ashi Alert to use on our daily chart that would alert when the candles change color. i.e. from red to white or white to red? This would be great to program to send alert to cell phone and popup sound alert on your computer. This way you would get notified when the candle is changing color and can make a judgement call to drive EA in opposite direction.

Anyone have an idea if this can be done. The way I would use it would to put it on the 4hr chart to send me an email and a popup alert if the Heiken Ashi changes color. It would give you a possible early warning that the trend may change direction. I have found various alerts but they have been for "Heiken Ashi Smoothed". I just want the regular Heiken Ashi to have an alert that sends an email and has a popup with sound on my computer.

Can the settings on the Heiken Ashi Smoothed be set to act like the regualar Heiken Ashi?

Mhm ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)..i think if u already set the TS it will show on the screen, never try it coz i'm still using the H04 version (without TS), I'm still using manual control on trailing stop.

The best thing you can do is to use a Trailing stop EA that can manage all your orders, insert it on another chart. That's what I'm doing, I'm using the Swiss army EA from another Tread, I'm demo trading for now though, and its been working for me.  
  
Ayo.

If the price break the upper orange trendline then the price might go up, but if the price just touching it then the price might still continue down, and if hit the lower green trendline then the downtrend confirmed valid. But looking at the daily candle pattern it seems like the bull is trying to swing the horn. U guys know when to stop or still driving the EA right?

I had a position go 96 pips against me, but it didn't open any new positions. I thought every 40 pips in the wrong direction it would open another position. Do I misunderstand how this EA works, or do I have a setting incorrect?  
  
Thanks,

I believe that is only one of the conditions that must be met before it will open another position. The EA also must find a suitable entry position within a "40 pip safe zone".   
  
I am not sure exactly how this works but I suspect it means if the price is super volatile and extends outside a 40 pip zone looking back a certain number of bars it wont make an entry. But I could be completely wrong on this.  
  
So in otherwords of the price goes against you and it is basically a continuous trend with no pullback it wont make an entry.  
  
If I am wrong any other users feel free to correct me ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I am confused Samurai. I was under the impression that we should drive this EA based on the Major trend off the Daily chart? Should we be turing this off when the H4 shows a reversal or let it ride?  
  
Thanks,

Hi guys,  
  
please help. I am trying to forward test the EA on 2 pairs i thnk trend well but are slower, but maybe safer. aud/nzd and eur/chf. I also like the usd/cad for easier trends to spot. However i cant get the ea to work on any of these pairs. I tried loading it 5 times on each. i lknow how to set it up. I changed the take profit, stop loss, pip step, and pips goal, pips loss accordingly to IBFX 4 decimal. So i am still doing something wrong or it doesnt accept these pairs. Can someone recommend why? These would be slower gains but easier trens to identify and if it goes against you it is slower to book big drawdown.  
  
all help is greatly appreciated

i tried this EA for about 3 weeks now, and the result is very good. I run the ea with my own thought of going sell or going buy.  
1\. my very simple going short or going long is just using daily candle price...if yesterday price is going down(short), then my order to this ea is just short..vice versa  
  
2\. i've read this whole discussion and found later, people trying to modified the setting of tf from 15 to 5. I tried it both. and find the 15 is better (for now..maybe because of the market). we never can predict that  
  
3\. other thing...i found that this ea (if we drive it the wrong way)...maybe not open position at all...or it will open the position and not opening the next layer (40 pip step etc). it is because of divergence effect i guess (i dont know this and why it is happen)  
  
4\. if we run it using HA smooth or normal HA....both way wins...what we should do is just keep our position according the color. others let the ea decide. very simple because it wont open the trade until the divergence say so... i like this filter. (but i dont know which one is better 0.002 or 0.004)..different pair, different divergence value.  
  
(errr samurai...what divergence that this ea calculates?) - what i saw was, it takes trades on retracement - sometime very accurates and sometime price move up a little before going to our way  
  
FYI - i just use the 1st ea samurai post here - firebird trader seven. and for yen pair- v1.0a  
  
still demoing it...and already set up the account for live trading...(with direction from HA only or my very simple setup of daily chart...hehe follow yesterday candle ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

>  please help. I am trying to forward test the EA on 2 pairs i thnk trend well but are slower, but maybe safer. aud/nzd and eur/chf. I also like the usd/cad for easier trends to spot. However i cant get the ea to work on any of these pairs. I tried loading it 5 times on each. i lknow how to set it up. I changed the take profit, stop loss, pip step, and pips goal, pips loss accordingly to IBFX 4 decimal. So i am still doing something wrong or it doesnt accept these pairs. Can someone recommend why? These would be slower gains but easier...

Hi BullsAndBear,  
  
All I know the EA taking less trade on aud/nzd and eur/chf, and open several trade on usd/cad, If the EA wont open trade I think u should wait for another 2 days, but if it still doesnt open trade and u alraedy follow each step setting i suggest u to reinstall the platform, but if it still not openig trades it mean the EA is not working on that pair, fyi..the EA works good on usd/cad pair, hope thats help.

Hi Jayman02,  
  
I still trade based on daily chart, but the market can reverse anytime, so i look for 4H chart to see what happens and make sure that i am still riding the trend, coz its more sensitif to recognize trend reversal.  
Look at the gbp/usd 4H chart below for an example,  
The price is breaking the lower orange trendline, it means that u have to turn on the "anticipation" mode, and if its continuing down then the trend is reverse, u may check daily candle for that spesific day i mention. Hope that clears u.

Hi fellow friend,  
As u can see that this system is costumable, the key is drive it in the right way. we can use our own tools to recognize the daily trend and anticipate the reversal, the tools i show u here is my tools, u guys may find your own tools more fits to your style, but make sure to share it here, u might help others.  
As i see along this time I never find a "Set and Forget" EA and makes a consistent positif result, the market is changing and still u have to watch your fully auto trade EA and tweak it along with the market behaviour changing, the energy we use is the same with semi auto, driving the EA daily is how i adjust the EA to the market behaviour. I say this becouse I am dumb on coding a program, but if anyone have a very good "Set and Forget" EA I would like to have it, i might change my mind ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).  
  
Keep the good work up bujal38![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).

For another consideration,   
Daily candle pattern on GU formed a reversal pattern...

It may be a bit too early to tell but seems as though the EU and GU seem to be in ranging mode right now which makes it very difficult to predict the direction of movement. I have a tough call to make, my GU & EU sell orders from yesterday are at about -150 pips. The Daily charts still show downward trend for both, however, on the GU especially does not look very promising on the H4.   
  
Getting close to Fib resistance level on GU however so might just stay with it, in too deep now to close I think, lol.   
  
I probably should have closed them yesterday around 5pm E.S.T. but was out and about.  
  
Its too bad there wasn't a way to tell when the currency is going to stay in ranging mode for a while because having EA set to auto would probably work very well in those conditions.  
  
The more I use this EA the more I think I am going to stay away from the Daily chart and focus on H4. The Daily has gotten me into more trouble than not so far.  
  
Any thoughts.

I agree. I use the THV system on the H4, everything in me was saying turn the EA off when the trend went flat and trix turned green but I decided to test the daily theory. Before I went to bed it wasn't looking good so I closed my open orders. You live and learn I guess. It's H4 for me from now on.

Ya, I think Daily is just too delayed to give any meaningful information unless the currency is in a very long trend.  
  
This has gotten me thinking a little about ranging vs trending. It seems as though the GU & EU have been bouncing off the Fib support and resistance levels for a few days now. Not sure if this idea is totally out in left field but what about adding a further "Drive Element".  
  
When the price is within the Fib Pivot lines have set to Auto when it breaks out have it set to the approprate "long only" or "short only".  
  
Once again I could be totally wrong on this just a thought.  
  
Update: Actually the more I think about this, probably wont work. Will still probably get more false orders if not driving, and not very often that it strays beyond Fib lines anyway.

This might work better on the H4. What do you think? If I had followed this yesterday I would have stopped out on two open orders. Closed early to cut my losses.

Do you mean start looking for EU short soon?  
  
If so I already have open Short EU orders that I am hoping will work out for me. Once the H4 gives me a solid down trend signal will turn the EA back on. H4 new bar is red but may wait another half hour - hour for confirmation.

Right. So what is your method for catching a solid signal?

Well usually just a red trend bar and a red HA candle without an upward shadow on the H4. Sometimes I'll go ahead anyway if there is a slight shadow in the wrong direction.  
  
How about you?

Pretty much the same except I look for confirmation on the trix as well. Earlier we had a red trend bar and canlde on the EU but the trend repainted to green.

The attached indicator is to help those who have been looking for a single and simple way of knowing the trend across all timeframes.   
  
Even by operating on a 1min chart, you'll be able to quickly figure out whether the 4hr and Daily charts are trending up/down so as to launch the Firebird EA in the right direction. Same applies to when the trend is beginning to change.

If we drive based on the 4hr chart do you think we will need to change our take profit to 50 pips again?

I've been tested this firebird version for 3 days, and it gains about +1450 pips.  
Floating Max around -600 pips, average 100-200 pips.  
Trade in EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD.  
  
I just wanna ask about opening position, this robot open so many trade even not in the same time. IN GBPUSD, it open up to 7 position (both way, BUY and SELL),how can i control that opening position?   
  
Can somebody help me.  
Actually, this robot is great for these days trading.  
  
Thanks,  
Edy

sounds like you need to go back and read the thread from the beginning it will answer all your questions. You can select long or short only trades on the common tab when you open the EA properties.

Hello Samurai friend,  
  
How are you doing, went live yet with firebird? And how is your company, turning profits okey? Well, I'm +60% for March, now I'm waiting for good trend established on one of my pairs, to put my money on stake, ofcourse microlots first, to see a reality show![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1).

hmmmm since we cant do the back test in full for this strategy, we cant know the performance of our system in full.  
  
my thought on riding this EA (my drunk drive style)....just follow yesterday candle - with exception of shooting star/hammer....long wick candle.  
  
then we could get 20 days of trading...and no less than 1minute analysis when to change direction (in driving...we have to give signal first for changing direction/lane etc![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) ).   
  
in 20 days of trading...lets say we got 200pip a day x 20 = 4000pips. give back to market lets say 1000pips...then we get in total 3000pips.....it is good for everybody i think. but we have to keep in mind on Money Management....dont get your account burnt just like that.  
  
the EA is here to help enter the trade. We decide where we want to bring the ea..to south or to north.

I,m great gasgas friend, u are missing something i guess, actually I went live with this for the very first time on arround Nov 08 (begin testing on live). Setting a company need some cash (wich i have to, u know famlily stuff..), need a real place first for my family, still cant rely my family on forex for now since anything can happen. Not much deposit so now I'm running it in a very carefull way since my broker doesnt provide micro lots, just my way to run this slowly. Btw its great to hear u profiting, waiting for another good news from u.

Yupz bujal38,  
  
Anyone has their own style how to drive this. Interesting to see GU since the reversal candle pattern formed.

Hi Guys,  
This is gonna be a long one so grab a coffee or fast forward!  
Experienced traders will know and understand all of this but hopefully newbies or less experienced folk may find something of use here.  
I pointed a senior member friend to this thread and his comment was that the EA looks good but every other post on the thread seems to be someone trying to find the perfect indicator or timeframe to define the trend and therefore eliminate drawdowns - it ain't gonna happen and if you are waiting for that perfect set of indis, you're never gonna pull the trigger and go live!  
  
The THV template gives more trend indis than you can shake a stick at and if you use more than 2 or 3 of them you'll never be able to make a decision - use one or two that suit you, backtest your results and base your strategy on them, switch all the others off or you'll remain confused.  
  
Samurai gave a sound piece of advice at the beginning - look at the news and add this to your analysis - don't let it form your decisions.  
The most recent posts now seem to be advocating looking at ever shorter timeframes because this week most currencies are ranging and making it difficult to come to a long or short decision - well - look at the news; we've got the G20 summit in London this week and NFP on Friday. The markets are unsure which way to go but general concensus is that $ strengthens during these summits.  
General concensus of Euro is that it is due to weaken in the short term. Another article on the AUD sugests that it is unlikely to strengthen much more before weakening against the USD. This is only what I've read so I don't know if it's good info or bad but it helps me to make a decision, combined with my analysis of the indicators that I've chosen to use.  
  
Let's look at the way the EA works; it places trades on retracements - every 40 pips on my settings. If you micro manage the EA on a 1 or 4 hour timeframe and get jittery every time it retraces you stop it from trading the way Samurai suggests and you will only ever close trades that are in drawdown - if you have even allowed the EA to place them in the first place.  
You will get to the bottom of a long trend littered with closed losing trades with virtually no winning trades yet when you back test it later it will show you should have made 1500+ pips!  
Going back to the first point - did the backtesting of your strategy show that long term you would be profitable with your strategy? If so, leave the EA alone to do its work - this is emotion at work which doesn't play a part in back testing but certainly does when you pull the trigger on a live account!  
  
So let's look at a trading situation; you're trading 3 $ pairs, SL=300, max orders=5, step=40. You are driving short and the price has spent a day retracing. Have you switched the EA's off or has your analysis given you the confidence to stick with your plan and leave the EA to do its job?  
In a worst case scenario you have 15 open orders and are close to your first SL position. This means you are (3 x -280) + (3 x -260) + (3 x -220) + (3 x -180) + (3 x -140) = -$3240 floating based on 0.1 lot / $10000 account. Ok - it wouldn't look like this in reality but you get the picture?  
  
Now, if this is too rich then you will be very tempted to start interfering with your trades. If your strategy is sound and properly backtested then you will leave it alone - you may SL out on one or two but the winners will cover it and long term you will win. Remember - your backtesting assumes you will leave all trades to run and the very positive back testing results that this EA gives are based on long term (daily timeframe) results.  
  
So - to summarise:  
Find two max indis that suit you to indicate the daily trend  
Keep an eye on the news and don't try to change your strategy to suit every week's chart pattern - understand why the charts are behaving as they are and switch off if necessary.  
Have faith in your strategy and backtesting so you can leave your emotions out of the picture when you go live  
Make sure that your settings match you money management rules.  
  
This is a large timeframe EA which means big numbers, potentially big profits, potentially big floating drawdowns but fortunately, according to my backtesting, not too many big stop losses and thus emotion will always play a big part.  
  
If the emotions attached to this size timeframe are too much then how about reducing your SL & TP's by a factor of 10 and backtest it on 4 hr or 1 hr trends?  
Only trade 1 pair?  
Reduce Max open orders or increase Pip step settings?  
  
All of this is just imho - don't mean to lecture but hopefully bring a slightly different perspective to the use of this great EA.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)

Do you let your trades run to the stoploss/take profit. I mean do you never close trades manually even if the trend has changed directions on the daily chart or do you just simply change directions that you are driving the EA and let all the trades be.

This is covering my word Namrettik, its just like I do something nescesary based on whats happen in 4H chart, my 4H chart tell me wether I should stick driving it, stop, or turn. It means that if I feel its nescesary to close my negative running position then I close it, maybe stop or turn if i think its the right time. Hope thats clears u. Cheers

I think El Dee and Samurai power both hit the nail on the head. The best way to drive this EA is to let it do it's thing. Stick to one timeframe and one indicator or reduce your stop loss and number of pairs traded. For me, I'm having success with this EA using HMA indicator on the daily chart, which I think it is originally made for. The purpose of an EA is to get rid of Human emotion and we got to let it do its thing, attaching emotion will result in loosing trades. I have had 100% profit on the pairs the EA traded, execept the ones I close manually myself. Just my 2 cent**.**  
  
**Ayo.**

Which of the indicators in the THV-system have all of you found to be the best ones for this system (and the daily TF)? Does anybody use ot for other TFs with this system? Have most here abandoned the original indicators?

Great post El Dee  
  
Hit my first SL today, not bad after 8 or 9 days of trading. I have to agree with his comment on indicators, I am actually thinking about cutting them back and using price & the news as my 2 primary indicators.  
  
On that note can any of you recommend a good news source to get a good sense of market conditions on a daily basis?  
  
Thanks all

Hi Every1 Just want to thank SamuraiP for bring this thread up. Drove the v63 today Long for Aussie (2 positions opened, 100pips in the bag one position still running +79) Short Swissy (3 positions running , -71, -29, +6) Long Yen (1 position opened -5) I am using the daily arrows direction of previous day matching the direction of the next day. GBPUSD and AUSUSD look similar but I didnt take the position on GBP. That's my report for now, also Friday is not actually a bad day to let the Firebird run from my experience netted more than 900 pips (50-100pips TP) across 6 currencies two weeks ago.. but the position ran thru Monday. FYI these positions are taken on demo account (Alpari and [FXpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile")). I have to say it is quite nerve racking at times I felt like closing the trades but I just get myself away from the PC, and actually like others have been saying this is what cause losses - emotions. And this is what SamP was saying u need to get comfortable with the EA while demoing b4 going live.   
I will stop my rambling now.   
Thanks to everyone for sharing their experience.

Hi Sergiel  
I am not an expert but I can say that these day news can be very misleading and I wouldnt advice anybody to even bother trading with it. But because it doesnt work for me is not a reason for it not to work for you.  
Few week back did u remember what happened on swissy the explosive more upwards ask anyone they will ascribe that to cut in interest rate by the Swiss CenBank but if you look carefully at the chart the move was just a short squeeze (flushing out - creating a fake sentiment before the reall move)  
So watch out, may be you ve been better than me at it. That's my 2cent  
  
Regards  
Lanre

Thanks, ya I know trading the news can be a bit dicey. I am actually thinking about taking El Dee's advice to the extreme and using price alone as my indicator (HA candles, and regular candles) on one demo account as an experiment.

Hi Every1  
Just want to share with u a little research I did (playing around with the settings on FB).  
This is just to show the effect of time filter on the net profit of FB  
I used the following time window & currency  
GBPUSD, 5mins TF, 2008-12-17 to 2008-12-30 (EA driven short only)  
Total net profit 1399.84 ( Time filter 8 -18 open to close)  
Total net profit 2398.72 (time filter 0 -24)  
  
Settings  
MA_length=10; MA_timeframe=15; MAtype=0; Percent=0.1; TradeOnFriday=1; slip=100; Lots=0.1; TakeProfit=1000; Stoploss=3000; Fast_Period=23; Fast_Price=1; Slow_Period=84; Slow_Price=1; DivergenceLimit=0.005; Use_V63D_Divergence=true; PipStep=400; IncreasementType=0; DVLimit=10; PipsGoal=5000; PipsLoss=5000; GMT=0; DST=0;   
OpeningHour=8 (change to 0);   
ClosingHour=18 (changed to 24);   
writelog=0;  
  
More to come later...  
Keep on Pippin

Hello All!  
  
I've been following this thread from page 1 and have tested this system with okay success (b/c my work schedule fluctuates too much where I can't really check my charts from home). But, I have really been wondering, why is it sooooo hard to create an EA to mimic this (Samurai's) firebird driven strategy??? I am not a programmer so, I'm not sure what would need to be done, it's just a burning question that I had since there are sooo many talented programmers out there and this is a pretty simple strategy to follow. But, idk... :-|

Hello,   
I'm new to the site. Your site is very good and very helpful.  
I've been demoing the Firebird v63G the regular way. Sometimes it goes out of control buying or selling. I like what you guys are doing using the trend to buy or sell only.  
My question: I'm using the "firebird v63G CCI v2. I use it with USDEUR and GBPUSD to either buy or sell only. The problem is that it doesn't do anything. I had it running for at least 24 hours now.  
  
My settings:

Thanks for your help and/or suggestions.

Did you place it on a M5 chart and do you see the smiling face at the top right?

Well I have posted my good results so far on this thread so only fair that I am honest about my bad days as well.  
  
Big losses today, about 1000 pips, ouch! Went short on the EU and GU early Monday morning (E.S.T.) unfortunately this was the bottom of the downtrend. Instead of closing the orders 10 - 12 hours later when there was a clear uptrend on the H4 I let them ride. 2 hit my SL, and then finally closed the other 3 a few minutes ago. Live and learn.  
  
What is bothering me is that I had both the EU and GU set to Long only for the last 10 hours or so and it made no trades despite a strong uptrend. I've never had it go that long without making a trade before. Would have been nice to counteract my losing trades.  
  
Hopefully tomorrow brings some pips to make up for today.  
  
Ps. anyone know how to get rid of the "Excessive Losses" Alert that keeps popping up every 2 seconds? Driving me nuts lol.  
  
Thanks

What is your SL? Mine is set @300 pips and I had up to 4 steps or levels yesterday on M5 EurUsd "Only Short" but never have hit SL. Now the 4th level got TP and only 3 levels floating. Yes, I have set it to short only since Monday based on HeikenAshi Daily chart trend, which is still short in my readig. My TP is 50, not 100 because of the sideways daily bars. Will change to 100 TP soon as the trend gets "more clear".  
  
I am also suffering from that excessive losses/lots alert thing. Can anyone tell us where to put "//" so that this alert routine is killed? Or any other way? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f922.png?v=15.1) RS

I never got that alert, don't know why you get it. Try this:  

  
Or: In common, below where you set Long or Short, uncheck Enable alerts.  
  
Or Simply turn off speakers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Hope that works for you guys.

I set the bird on e/u last night before bed. right before a nice retrace. it triggered an order @ 1.3265, nice entry, and closes for 75 pips,,,hoorah. then e/u retraces again @ 1040 gmt, for about 56 pips, yet no trigger. it was a nice retrace for perfect entry. pipstep is set to 40. everything set exactly per instructions. does this happen sometimes???  
  
thank you guys for all this info. I am keen to learn this ea.

Hi All  
Thot this might be relevant since another NFP day is around the corner  
It is from a blog I read daily from fxstreet.  
  
[Which is important - NFP data or traders positions?](http://blogs.fxstreet.com/marketreadings/2009/03/06/which-is-important-nfp-data-or-traders-positions/)  
Posted on March 6, 2009 at 15:59 in [Market comment](http://blogs.fxstreet.com/marketreadings/category/market-comment/), [Market forecast](http://blogs.fxstreet.com/marketreadings/category/market-forecast/), [Operators' intentions](http://blogs.fxstreet.com/marketreadings/category/operators-intentions/) by Dr. S. Sivaraman  
When traders avoid taking positions before NFP data release the market made subdued moves before and after the announcements.Then when the players found that the traders with bearish feel shorted yesterday EURO and GBP during drop and are waiting for ‘risk aversion move after NFP data,the players firmed up to hit their stops or induced them to do the short covering.Later when traders developed the bullish feel and bought EURO and GBP on breakout trades,the players are now making the drop to hit their stops on the downside.later they are expected to rise again EURO and GBP for week end.So it is not NFP data which is important for the players to make moves in the market ,actually it is traders pending positions to hit their stops.So the players are more focused on their profits,but traders want to know more about the economy of various countries day in and day out.Who is smart?  
Regards  
Dr.Sivaraman

Hi B&B  
I am going to speculate that probably the all the criteria to take the trade were not met (I suspect the Divergence limit).  
I have turned one FB on GBPUSD today since morning and also no single trade yet but I will just let it be.  
Ciao

Hi All  
I have been testing again and here is a "short" summary. (After another 100pips booked on USDCHF today, there is a lot of incentive to do this ...lol)  
  
I am testing the effect of the TP, DVLimit, Divergence Limit and Percent - settings on Drawdown, Profits and number of trades on the GBPUSD between 17-12-08 and 30-12-08  
For this I am using the default setting for most of the parameters ([http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=949](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2645467&postcount=949))  
  
The first test is to see the effect of percent of the drawdown and no. of trades, So I used the range 0.01 to 0.1 (pass 1 to 10 optimisation report_percent see file in the atachement). From this it clear that lower percent setting makes slightly more profit (100pips) but higher drawdown. Now the decison have to be based on the answer to this question will be can you stomach additional 3% drawdown for just 100pips? The answer will definitely be personal.   
  
For the next test (Divergence Limit) I used the 0.1 (6.67% drawdown not different from 0.09 percent setting). Here the Divergence limt range of 0.001 to 0.01 was used. Results shows that pass 6 and 7 - 0.006, 0.007 (Optimisationreport_dvlimt file in attachement) has the right mixture of risk and profit by my judgement (i.e. drawdown and profit).  
  
These conclusions (Percent - 0.1, Divergent Limit - 0.006) was carried forward into the next test to see the effect of the DVLimit (I have no idea if it is different from the Divergent limit above but let see). I used the range 10 to 100 (10 passes). For this test I couldnt find any difference at all for the whole range, drawdown same and profit the same (OptimizationReport_DVLimit10-100.htm). So I am keeping that setting at 10 - the default, until there is more information to support changing it.  
  
Finally, I tried the effect of TP using the range 500 to 3000 (I am using a 5digit broker). Remember for this I am also carrying forward the setting from the three previous test. The results (OptimizationReport_TP500_3k.htm) pass 1- 6 = 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000. In my opinion TP 1500 and 2000 is just about right for GPBUSD, according to this test as they produce nice profit and lesser drawdown with a lesser number of trade. One could also argue for TP 2500 as well since it produced the highest profit but the let down is that it has the highest drawdown.  
  
Thats it for now, the next stage will be to look into another time window and see how these settings will perform.  
Hope I didnt bore you too much.  
My regards  
Keep on Pippin

Thanks  
  
I have read this entire thread and maybe need to go back over it again. So the 40 pipstep is not the only criteria to open another trade. That makes sense now. We got plenty of room to go up so will hope for a nice retrace to open up others. i havent played the gbp/usd pair for awhile. May revisit that pair and see if we get more trades.  
  
thanks a bunch

Thanks Gasgas that did the trick.  
  
Well happy to report when I woke up this morning the EA grapped another 400pips with the EU & GU on long, and UC on short. The interesting thing is this was on my demo account that had the MA = 5 on the M5 charts. On my other demo account which was set to MA = 15 on the M5 charts, not a trade all night, even though everything else was set the exact same way. Hmmmmmm ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Yes, I have set it to short only since Monday based on HeikenAshi Daily chart trend, which is still short in my readig. My TP is 50, not 100 because of the sideways daily bars.

Those are also a criteria to opening a trade. 5MA will detect a trade faster than 15MA on the 5 Mins chart.  
  
So, I guess 3 criterias for the EA to open a trade have been analysed so far;  
  
1) Steps - 40  
2) Divergence setting  
3) MA period.  
  
This really throws more light on how the EA works. The only probelm now is how to reduce drawdowns. Don't worry we'll figure it out soon. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

The MA=15 probably ensures more accurate entry points but if last night is any indication it is costing alot of pips in lost trades. Mind you 1 day is way too soon to tell for sure, will keep testing.

It's better to miss the money than to loose money. So, for now, I'm sticking with the MA=15.

Does it really prevent losing money? I thought using MA=15 just helps find the bottom of a retrace, so you maximize your profits on the trend. I could be wrong but whether you use MA=5 or MA = 15 isn't going to be what keeps you out of bad trades, this will be dependent on your "Driving skills".

Is it only me or..  
I tried the Trailling Stop version yesterday to see how it perform, but the TS seems not working, if it is then I will change it to the H04 version or v63G again. Any opinion?

Hey Samurai, I haven't tried forward testing yet, but I noticed on the back test the TS made absolutely no difference.

Tuesday night I saw the writing on the wall that the downtrend was over but saw a little indication that the downtrend may resume on the 4hr chart so I left it Short and went to bed. I watched it all day and it seemed to be coming back on the 4hr chart so I let it ride again on wednesday. I had a Big shock this morning. I closed the trades and went long this morning. I am going to stick to the daily chart only. I think that if you watch the smaller timeframes it can get you out early or make you stay in and can be the wrong thing to do. If you are consistant and get in and out by the daily chart I think it is best. At least that is what I did on all my backtesting with great success.

Well, by the time I found this thread it was 60+ pages long and it took me 3 days to get through it. Needless to say, I started demo trading by about the 20th page because I saw the potential this system had. I agree that a KISS approach is best: Keep It Simple Stupid. Too many indicators just confuse the h*ll out of me (i am somewhat of a newbie - about nine months of continuous studying and 2 blown live accounts). I'm just using the original template listed in Post 1 along with the Channel Surfer indicator. I follow the daily chart with confirmation on the 4 hr. I find the channels quite useful (I'm just not that good drawing them myself). I will try to contribute what I can to this thread. Thank you all for your help and info thus far.

Yes, H4 and Daily so far agree, and I also received a subribed signal that recomended going long on EU: "Buy EUR/USD at 1.3489 or better, stop loss at 1.3289, take profit at 1.3689"  
  
Thats good enough for me, but at your own risk obviously.

Ollypips...  
  
I just looked at your test results and then I noticed the period you chose for your tests. I hate to tell you this, but that's the worst period of the year to test anything, ie: winter holidays, since the trading then is the most erratic and all the big traders are on holidays.  
  
If I may suggest, please repeat the test for a whole month, maybe Feb/09 and March/09.

Hope every1 took pips on GBP this morning just bagged 146.4pips (150pips TP). I am using the 5-8EMA arrows on the daily in conjunction with candle (HA) colour. So it is like this if there is an arrow pointing up from yesterday while the HA is still red and today the candle is white in agreement with the arrow I drive FB long. News, whatever doesn't really matter I still drive it the way the prices are telling me. Market participant will always interpret the news differently but the major players know where they want to drive the market.  
FB didn't take any trade on GBP until late last night and now it has taken two positions one already closed for profit (as stated above). What I am driving at here - pick a way u want to drive the FB backtest it and stick with it, losses will come and go but FB will be profitable in the long run.  
A quick question is anyone using the FB fix for Yen crosses? The orignal FB is not taking much trade on the USDJPY but I wont sweat it just let it do its thing.  
Back to my reaserch lab....(testing 5 and 15 MA timeframe, taking MAC109 suggestion) will keep u posted.  
Ciao   
Lanre

For those who are still looking for some of the best trend indicators to use for daily TF, you may try any of the two attachments. The 'Nonlag MA' is good in picking a change in trend while 'Trend' is good in predicting an impending turn. I do use both indicators for 2 daily charts for a currency pair to see if they agree... and have been doing so with good success.  
  
Cheers!

Samurai has done a good job with his chart template already so this is just to add to it. If you are still looking for some of the best trend indicators to use for daily TF, you may try any of the two attachments.

I've been looking into this as something of a supplemental strategy since I usually only trade the London session manually.  
  
I noticed something with your updated EA that might affect performance:  
  
In the "[Firebird-v63H04 (EA) 5 digit platform.mq4](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=228239&d=1238739880)", MaxOpenOrders defaults to 5. In the old TS one that you posted before, the default was 10.  
  
If I remember correctly, your method is to use all defaults except for the TP, SL, and PipStep (100-300-40) so the above would actually affect your performance since it won't open any more positions after the first 5 increments of your pipstep.  
  
Maybe I'm misinterpreting the use of that setting (MaxOpenOrders), but I just thought I'd point this out since it may actually impact your testing of this system.  
  
  
(On the side note, the "5 digit platform" part is appropriate for any IBFX users here -- I just received an e-mail saying they're switching their live accounts to 5 digit quoting as of next week. So if anyone's using Firebird with IBFX, the currently posted version is appropriate.)  
  
Anyway, keep up the good work, everyone.

Needless to say, I started demo trading by about the 20th page because I saw the potential this system had. I agree that a KISS approach is best: Keep It Simple Stupid. Too many indicators just confuse the h*ll out of me (i am somewhat of a newbie - about nine months of continuous studying and 2 blown live accounts). I'm just using the original template listed in Post 1 along with the Channel Surfer indicator. I follow the daily chart with confirmation...

Wow 66 pages on this thread and heaps more on the earlier 2 threads. Plus I dont know how many side tracks to at least 2 other forums & 1 archive site for FireBird from 1.0a to 1.0c to 2.0. Then 63g to 63h04(which was 63h03 inside) to 65tf. Oh and some "yen fixes" along the way to keep me guessing. Heaps of circles within circles.  
  
Well I would like to thank SamuraiPower so much for starting this thread with his idea to drive FireBird according to the current trend. Plus also thanks to the programers of the FireBird way back, that go/went by the handles of TraderSeven, Ron, hdb, & Renato (is that Renato as in the CEO of the software company that developed MetaTrader).  
  
Thanks also to the recent FF programmers & funyoo & codersguru, who have got me interested in programming again. Now got more lesson sites & courses to go thru. Well I think its thanks, I wasnt really wanting that programming bug again, just wanted to trade forex & quietly make money. Ha - yea right aye.  
  
Have loaded up an ea or 3 (another learning curve in itself) near the page 20 mark & so have been tweaking it all the way thru. No real record of what tweaks did what, but the history screens so many more positive pips than earlier.  
  
To all the guests reading FF, register. Its easy & you dont get spam. Only 1 catch is if you subscribe to a thread uncheck the send me emails option as you subcribe to each thread. To all those currently reading this thread, drop a quick note to say hi & that you are off reading & why. Will be interesting to see if thats still your mind set when you catchup. Wish I had done it.  
  
Enough dribble, time to sort my act out & my ea's & their settings to something like logical. Maybe a clean demo too. So heaps of questions coming sorry.  
See you in the wash -  
Cheers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) hey SamuraiPower I found these too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

Hi All  
What a day, lots of pips in the bag and lots to report as well  
Firstly Gasgas Thanks, I can gladly confirm that the yen fix version is superior to the v63g FB for Yen crosses. So for everyone that's the conclusion from my testing (confirming Gasgas findings).  
Ok now to the issue of 5min MATF or 15min MATF. I have attached my results of ten trend I could identify from January till today on GBPUSD. And on these results I carried out a Ttest (dependent variable) and a Sign Test for confirmation (For those well versed in statistics, they will know what I mean - for other it is all not so complicated). To cut the long story short, there is no statistical difference between the two (a look at the excel file will tell the story)  
Below is the setting I used  
MA_timeframe=(5 or 15); MA_length=10; MAtype=0; Percent=0.1; TradeOnFriday=1; slip=100; Lots=0.1; TakeProfit=1500; Stoploss=3000; Fast_Period=23; Fast_Price=1; Slow_Period=84; Slow_Price=1; DivergenceLimit=0.006; PipStep=400; IncreasementType=0; DVLimit=10; PipsGoal=5000; PipsLoss=5000; GMT=0; DST=0; OpeningHour=0; ClosingHour=24; writelog=0;   
As you can see I am using Divergence Limit 0.006 and TP 1500, carrying forward previous finding for those setting in my earlier post.  
NFP, NFP...what can I say, hope you guys can see that it doesnt really matter much what is coming thru the news to drive this EA. Once you can identify the trend correctly, there will have to be a big calamity to turn everything upside down (that doesnt happen often).  
So for me, for the day - a friday for that matter, got profits on USDCHF (100pips - demo), GBPUSD (246pips - live), EURUSD (100pips - demo), USDCAD (100pips -demo).  
It been a very very lovely week and I am sure there are many more to come, have a wonderful weekend (I think I will - playing football on saturday and watching MANU on Sunday .... I see a win).  
Hey guys found this - <http://www.forexbrace.com/content/category/4/15/77/>  
keeping in line with the Semi-Automatic trading lovely stuff. Watch the vidoes and u can also donwload EAs that can make trading much easier.  
Enjoy guys and keep on Pippin  
Lanre

Check post #1 in this thread.  
(As of the moment I'm writing this post, SamuraiPower has posted a 5-digit broker version of Firebird for use with his "driven" style on the first post of this thread.)

Thanks for sharing!  
  
Could you someone please add an email alert to the Trend.mq4 indicator when the color changes?

Right I was expecting it to reverse and go long again based on daily trend. Can someone confirm whether or not this is the correct strategy based on Samurai's 1st post.

Mhmm...monday..monday..monday..  
I was looking at the price about 12 hours ago, and the daily chart says there is a major resistance at arround 1.4972 but I was too busy too post the chart, as u can see the price failed to break the level. IMHO as I analyze news, for me it has the second priority after PA, but if the news come when the price near the major resistance/support it will become a trigger to reverse in a big move, even Cad news can have a big impact on other pairs. This plain candle can gives us a little bit insight of what might happen and a precaution to prevent losses, this is what the template cant give, the HA and arrow indicator still cant give an early warning for this. Looking at the 4H candle it might be a good moment to close the loss and wait till the daily trend is clear to jump again.  
For first timer, please dont start on monday, start when the template gives u a clear sign. U cant prevent loss but u can minimize it, but if u follow the template with once or twice control a day (specially on news time) I still can say that it still be profiting in the end of the month.  
I trade it in demo and close it in -276pips, I'm gonna pay the loss when the trend is clear.

Once again the trend has done a 180 at opening of London session Monday. From now on myself, sitting out until Monday A.M. to determine trend.  
  
Now the question is do I cut my losses (1000 pips) or hope it retraces before closing the orders. Ahh decisions, decisions.

Oh so confused.... If I listen to El Dee's advice on post 937 then I let my long positions ride. If I let my emotions drive my decisions I cancel my positions now. Perhaps Samurai I need some clarification of your original post on how to drive this EA. It would be much appreciated.

There is a medium term resistance to be broken, but the Daily still signals a LONG trend, so, for now I'm going to stop driving the EA Long, until I know if its a reversal or just a retracement unless you want to trade using lower TFs than Daily you might loose money now, because it might range for a while before it decides a direction it wants to go, unless something major happens like some NEWS, but Monday is always not a NEWS day. So, I'm staying out, since I take my decisions on Daily TF. My 2cents.  
  
Ayo.

Just info..  
I trade based on daily chart and control it form the 4H chart.  
Price always move in channel and respect support and resistance level, sometimes its hard to define the channel and support/resistance, but most of the time u can see it clear, u might find it usefull combining with this system to minimize loss, just learn it u will find it easy and simple.  
  
I learn support/resistance here <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=86429>  
read the PDF file coz its very good  
  
and I learn how to draw trendline here  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...light=psiholog](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=150188&highlight=psiholog)  
its very good also  
  
But dont make it difficult with lines all over the chart, just keep making it simple.  
  
The only thing u need to be succesfull with forex is "Learn" and "$1000".

No dont be confuse, stick with daily TF and try follow it blindly (without emotion) u will find good result in the end of the month.  
I just trying to minimize loss coz when the price reverse suddenly the daily template on my first post is late on recognizing it, as u can see now on GU, the HA and arrow is still not giving the reversing signal untill tomorrow candle occur, so I use 4H chart (but my prediction on 4H chart still might be wrong). So if u find it hard to apply to your strategy just follow my first post and advice from El dee. Cheers

IMO, also we should analyze previous PA, big swing usually followd by consolidation and profit taking action. Last weeek there was big swing bcs of g20 meeting and today monday, time for profit taking action.

Hello all.  
  
I and my sister(programmer) have been following your thread since the beginning and hope to contribute to it soon.  
Just wondering if you really have a preference with limits. For example if you were to follow the hourly you might have 20tp and 50sl but daily you would do a 100/300.  
Samurai I understand you do a100/300 following the daily with a check of the 4hr.  
But today for example the 4hr may not be quick enough with the trend changes that happened. Has a set of TP’s and SL’s been really proven yet or is it still personal pref. for most?  
  
  
Also…..  
My sister is working on yet another addition to F-bird. One thought we had was to put a stop trading function in F-bird if stop loss was hit.  
  
For example let say you picked e/u to go long today and you use 50tp50sl (or 100/100) as your limits.  
  
Along as FB got in and won it would keep going. 1st loss would stop that pair and await a reset. This would also assume because you hit your SL that you had a trend change.  
Sorry not a big fan on pipstep we been burned too many times in reverse trend market.  
  
If you had 3(one or more) wins before one loss then lock in at least 100pips(50/50) and if you had 1win and 1 loss well you broke even and if you had one loss first well go back and figure out why you picked the wrong direction. Read trend wrong? Experts were wrong today? Bad Luck?  
  
Any thoughts?

Yep, I posted the charts because there're those who rely on the 4-hr TF for any hint of a change in the Daily's trend. 

From the tips to the dips, it's all about the pips

Im like a kid that goes to the beach for the first time. On Sunday I have to jump in....I think you are correct, we need to wait for the candle change on monday Night here in the U.S. I closed all my trades for a loss that were opened last night but I will eventually catch the beginning of a trend make it all back.

What settings are you using for the Yen fix version? Can you post your settings file?

I'll try and do that ASAP. I also want to see if this version of Trend can be modified because I discovered on M1 and M5 TFs that it repaints. 

From the tips to the dips, it's all about the pips

When I went to bed the H4 on the EU/US was up so I left the FB to do it's thing. I woke up to a reversal and 4 open positions. I suppose Sunday and Monday trading might be too risky.

Ohh yesss, emotions emotions..., turn them off is the hardest thing when real money is in the game. I stopped using H4 at all. Mabey not the smartest thing, but it confuses me so many times couse I got oposite signal than in daily. So witch one to listen!!? G/Y candle might end up with doji today, I guess Pound strenght is weakening, I just might go short on G/U tomorrow...waiting for confirmation...will see

My observations re Sunday (Monday Asia) are that in most cases, the price continues with what it was doing on Friday.   
  
All last week we had huge long runs against the US$, so it's no surprise that a retracement or reversal was imminent.  
  
And I've also noticed that the majority of reversals or big moves, happen at the 8 am EST NY open. Check a 4 hour chart and you'll see that the 8 am candle is the big one. The next biggest one is the London open at 4 am EST. There are other turnaround points, but none as big and consistent as the 8 am NY open. Open a 4 hour chart and check the past history to confirm it.  
  
That's what happened this morning on all the major pairs. I believe the GBP/USD will continue to drop at least to a 38% Fibo retracement point @ around 1.4600.

Hi Everyone  
Blow out day for every1 I suppose (same here) - closed out all the trade today, market will do its thing but the important thing is that we need to be prepared.  
Scalpz the data quality I am getting is 50% I have tried downloading 1min data from Alpari Databank but it is not possible right now (need to call them and ask why) and I am using the strategy tester in MT4.

Ayoneeye  
I am from 9ja but I am living in London (currently)  
  
I was trying to stress test (if that is right to call it) the system this weekend but checking if I didnt close out the trade one day after a trend change but I was able to catch the begining of the trend how bad could it get. The results (for GBPUSD the only pair i have tested) still shows that FB will still put me in profit (proper position sizing ofcourse). So that gave me a lot of confidence not to worry too much about those bad days. Also I was reading a little write up (7 habits of highly sucessful trader) over the weekend and one thing really got thru to me many traders abandon systems because they dont really know what kind of bad days it could have. So I was more or less prepared for todays action.  
So I will suggest every1 again put their trend change system to test ... test it for all possible scenarios (if u cant get access to ur platform for 1 or two days how bad can it get, when trend changes and u have to close all lossing trades how bad can it get). And also the most important one money management, whats the average number of trades FB takes and if there is a massive movement (it continues to take trades) and they all hits the SL how much of your account will go with that (position sizing guys).  
  
Gasgas  
Can you explain some of the setting in the FB JPY fix  
MaxMargin Level  
CloseLossing trades  
Closehour  
Losslevel  
Other looks obvious enough but these I need to get a clear understanding of what they mean.... Thanks  
  
MAC109  
I am using the default setings but I've changed the TP to 1000 (for USDJPY, GBPJPY and 500 for EURJPY) , SL 3000, Divergent Limit 0.005 (instead of 0.002) but I need more clarification from Gasgas  
NB I am driving using the FB template posted on the 1st post (agreement of direction between the candle colour and the arrow)  
  
Thanks to every1  
Keep on Pippin

I don't have a sell arrow on the GBP chart. What settings are you using for the 5-8 openEma indicator. I am using the 5,8 setting right now. I have not shorted the GBP because I don't have confirmation of the down trend arrow (see attached chart).  
  
I am shorting the the EURUSD as of zero GMT time 4/7/09 and have 100 pips so far.

Strange I don't have sell arrow or red candle on GBP. Could this be due to different brokers? I use Fxdd.  
  
FB has not open any positions on Eu yet. Turned it on again this morning around 8am California time.

Mine opened a trade at 12:48 gmt time which is 7:48 am Eastern Daylight Time U.S. I think this would be 4:48 am pacific time U.S. I think you just missed it.

I'm in a sell on the GBP/USD and USD/JPY too.

My setting is 1,2 but when its too choppy I filter it with 5,8....

Man these ranging prices are making my head spin, lol. Might be good to return back to Samurai's fist post, and wait for a confirmation on the Daily before making any decisions. True you may miss 200, or 300 pips of a movement but will help keep us out of bad trades.  
  
This week is pretty much a bust for me so far, but have to stay positive still up 2400 pips overall in 3 weeks.

I have added a few indicators to help the fbTemplate with your exit strategy. Attached is a screenshot of the indicators. When I have a confirmation of the three indicators all showing trend change I will exit my trades.  
  
All three must be in agreement.  
  
Short Exit   
  
MTF CCI 14 - exit when 4 hour changes to +100 positive.  
THV Trend - when trend color changes to yellow  
10tionreader - when 4hr changes to yellow on all three bars  
  
Long Exit  
MTF CCI 14 - exit when 4 hour changes to -100 negative  
THV Trend - when trend color changes to yellow  
10tionreader - when 4hr changes to yellow on all three bars  
  
I am backtesting this and live demo testing this and will post my feedback. The idea is to have a good confirmation that the trend is changing.  
  
All these indicators are free. I am still trying to determine the best way to use them together.

watching support and resistance levels on the H4 may be a an easier way to go it helped me get out before the reversal.

Are you using an indicator such as pivots or are you just plotting your own S & R lines?

Try the LRC indicator on the Daily on 4hrs chart, it will show you the S & R levels. The indicator is somewhere on this forum, search for it if you don't have it.

My idea is just a suplement to this system, but we need a programer to do this, I hope coders will help us on this.  
Ok...I am thinking about giving a trendline as an area to control wether the EA still trade or not, for better understanding I think u guys should watch this video first (or maybe u watch it already)  
  
<http://www.forexbrace.com/content/view/187/77/>  
  
Let me give u an example on the daily chart below,  
On a short trade or in a downtrend market u draw the trendline to give the EA an area to trade or not (to make it easy, draw the trendline on daily chart and of course after that switch it to 5 Min coz the EA will work on 5 Min chart),  
if the price breaks the trendline or entering the forbidden area or above the trendline, the EA will not open another short trade untill we adjust it again and vice versa, so that we dont have to worry about drawdown when the price reverse and we might reduse the SL accordingly. Once again we need a humble coders here to help us out. Hopefully this can make our trade easier. Feedbacks are welcome.  
  
Regards,  
Samurai Power

I like the concept but couldn't we simplify it more to be when the Heiken Ashi changes color on the daily chart not to open more trades in the wrong direction. Seems like it would be a simple code that we can turn off and on.

Hi Namrettik, SamuraiPower and others Firebird user.  
I have been working on this idea since Namrettik propose to have the Heiken Ashi indicator to send a email or produce an alert. I was able to modify it as you know but the copyright issue prevent me to publish this modification.  
So since the beginning of the week i worked to find a way to use this idea whithout mofying the indicator(so no copyright issue). The good news is that i was able to do it and it seem to work pretty well with the simulator for the last reversal. Instead of loosing 1000 Pip and more, it loose only 500 on EURUSD whithout doing nothing and still drive for long even if the 4hr and daily chart was pointing to short.  
  
I still have to clean the code and do some final test before i publish it for more testing.   
  
So tell me, in which version of Firebird you would like to have it first.   
I have it now in the 63H04-TS modified version. (Corrected small bug in it and obsolete function call so there is no more warning when compiled).

Since the Monday disaster I have made some pips  
  
usdcad 100pips - long  
usdchf 100pips - long  
eurusd 500pips - short  
  
I have one trade open at the time of this post **eurusd** that is at 35pips. I set the stoploss to 1 pip profit and will let it run hopefully to 100tp. I have turned off the ea for the rest of the week. There is a strong support line at 1.3112 that was tested on 3/30/09 that is close to being retested again today. I decided to sit on the sidelines and keep what I have gained since the monday loss.

Sounds like you are trading manually against the daily?

but according to the daily trend on the eurusd it is down?  
Can i ask what was the indicator used in driving the eurusd long? Was it based on a shorter time frame? The daily, 4hour and 1 hour all shown a down trend? The 5 min, 15 min and 30 min show an up trend?  
Which one is the best to go off for driving the EA?  
thanks

Great Work, I wonder if you can add a manageable entry and exit feature to FB 63H version. It will make this version an excellent EA for day trading Trends.   
For example: we know, hypothetically, that Trending pairs trend between tow points usually a fixed support and resistance. I want to sell resistance and buy support, I want Firebird to catch these precise trades by being able to managed it by entering the value where it can start trading and where it takes profit. If this feature is on then they other features are off  
such a feature should have a sL of 100pips. If you develop this new feature, then FB V.63H can follow the trend up, down and trending (for well seasoned day traders.)  
What do you think?

HI Namrettik,  
try it and let me know.  
I have included the alert feature and or email. So look at the setup variable.  
Manage_Trade = true : if you want to have the feature off put it to false  
Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod = 60; //H1=60, H4 = 240, D1= 1440 (You can select which time period of the indicator by putting the right amount of minutes.  
index = 1; Put it at 0 if you want the manage feature on the current bar being form. If you activate the email feature make sure to have it at 1 otherwise you are going to have a lot of message when the bar cross from one state to the next.  
email =false : Change it to true if you want an alert. If you want an email make sure to setup your metatrader to send you email. Go on tool, option and email tab and fill the information required.  
  
I hope it will help your trading. I did a simulation on GDPUSD from the 1 of april to 10 of april with Heiken Ashi time period at 240 with long only and it gave a net profit of 132 pips which is much better than what i got.  
  
Have fun and let us know how this work..  
  
bye

Will these send an email alert on the strategy tester with email set to true. What happens when the alert occurs. Is it just an alert or does it close all trades at that time that are open.

It is only an alert. There is no strategy to close open loosing trades in this version. This is an other step that could improve our profit to lost ratio if we find the right setup.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi, you can try this EA, i think this will do what you are looking at for day trading. You need to setup the resistance and setup corridor and it will buy at support and sell at resistance. Just drag this EA on your chart, it will show you two line, you can move those line where you want and that's it.  
  
Sometime the line are difficult to find, in order to help the process, display more data on your chart, you should be able to locate it.

Is the only way to test the alert is to put the ea on a live demo account

Hi Barnaba,  
I have an indicator similar to what you have on your chart that defines the dynamic S & R. Is that an LRC or what?, I mean the red lines showing S&R. Moreover, you have many indicators in the ZIP file, which of the indicator is the yellow arrow?.

Yes, in simulation mode it will not work.  
To test it select a 1 minute charts, setup the variable this way  
  
Manage_Trade True or false, it will work both way  
Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod = 1  
index = 1  
email = true  
  
Place a chart on your metrader on the M1, apply the EA and wait for changing color.  
If you want to received an email, you need to enable it from your tool/option menu.

Great work Actionpl. This will really improve the EA performance. The issue is, Heiken_ashi is a lagging indicator, so it will detect trend change a little bit late. I guess if you can make it MTF, so it can give signal when a lower TF to the TF you placed it on changes, It will be very good. For example, signal changes on 4hrs TF, while the EA is on Daily.  
Thanks for your effort.

Hey fren,   
Im starting to use PA and S/R lines before any indicators. They don't repaint and lag, and a lot of profesionals use only that to earn in fx world. There is no magic indicators to tell us exactly when to exit or enter.   
  
Will look up your new idea it makes sence, but will be hard to aplly in EA, I suck at programming, but someone could do it mabey. This week wasn't best to start live, gbp moves very slowly and flat, hope next week will me more active![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Namrettik,  
i found a way to acces by programmation to the Thv Trend color coded information. I would like to add an exit strategy to the Heigen Ashi manage EA. Have you got time to evaluate the strategy that you are proposing?  
I'm planning to have an exit strategy program into the EA using the THV Trend and the Heiken Ashi or the Heiken Ashi smooted to exit loosing trade automatically.  
The idea will be:   
If the 4HR THVTrend is Yellow, reduce the stop lost by 50%  
for a buy if the Heiken Ashi 4Hr is red and ThvTrend yellow or red, close trade again the new driving condition.  
For a sell, if the Heiken Ashi 4HR is green and the ThvTrend is Green, ==> close trades that are again the new driving condition.  
  
We will still need to follow closely the EA to turn it off when the market is not trending. But it should allow us more time to reac.   
We need to evaluate what will be the impact of this strategy on the net profit after a month or so.  
  
I would like to have input of the team in order to setup an exit strategy that have more chance to work.  
  
Anybody who have good idea allong those lines we can discuss it here an come to a conclusion. I would like to minimize my programmation time since it can take some time to do that and i don't have a lot of free time.  
  
Thanks for your input.

I am not familiar with what you mean by access to programation. Do we need to get permission from the creator of the indicator to do this or are we just using it along with this ea and are not violating copyright on THV3 Trend indicator. I would contact cboraforex the creator of the THV3 Trend indicator and ask for permission to modify the indicator for this purpose if we are modifying the indi. I would be glad to test and provide feedback.

I have put a chart of the 4hr eurusd and the daily eur usd with the same trendline. If we would follow the rules above we would be closing all trades that are short per the 4hr chart.....but.....I think it would be premature..because the price action (PA) may just go up and bounce of the trendline I have drawn on the 4hr chart. The daily chart still shows a strong downtrend that may be just retracing. I do like the idea of shortening up the stops when the 4hr turns red or yellow, I will have to think about that. I like the idea of being able to set our own rules like you did with the heiken ashi and leave it up to the trader to chose whether to use the 4hr chart or the daily chart with the heiken ashi and the THV3 Trend indicator. What do you think.

Hi, no i don't modify the code of the indicator so no copyright isssue. I got the info just by looking at available variables provided by the indicator.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

i think shortering stoploss 50% when 4hr make changes makes no sense because every time when it retraces then it will change sl.  
then we can put sl 150 not 300 at EA options.  
  
am i right ?

i found that in AUDUSD those settings are more profitable:  
  
tp 50  
sl 200  
pipstep 20  
div. limit 0.01  
  
my thoughts are that: when it moves against then will be bigger drawdown risk.  
  
please test and let me know what u think of those settings.  
  
sry for my bad lang.  
  
thank you all for attention.

> Great work Actionpl. This will really improve the EA performance. The issue is, Heiken_ashi is a lagging indicator, so it will detect trend change a little bit late. I guess if you can make it MTF, so it can give signal when a lower TF to the TF you placed it on changes, It will be very good. For example, signal changes on 4hrs TF, while the EA is on Daily.

Hi,  
i think each pair will have his particularities and we will need to program it in such a way that each user will be able to experiment with different setting. Using the daily chart is too slow for me since it will have you hit the SL on many trades before you decide to change direction. As it happen this week. By the time we got the beginning of the second red daily Heiken Ashi indicator most of the retracement was done (open at 1.35698 and close @ 1.33620) So the trades open on the 3 of april were all call by the stop lost. That what happen to me. So i will prefer to find a strategy that will reduce my exposure to large drawdown by using the 4hr or ??![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

I think they mean Multi-timeframe (MTF)....i.e. 60m 1hr 4hr 1day etc.   
  
I think TF is simply timeframe.

I don't think you can automate with the THV3 Trend and the Heiken Ashi. I think alarms can be set to make you anaylze the chart but having the ea reduce SL and close trades would be good some trades and bad others. Sometimes price action (PA) is breaking out and sometimes it is simply retracing. I think you need to draw trendlines on the 4hr chart and watch for breakouts......or breakdowns.....I am sure there is an indicator that can be used to trigger an alarm if PA breaks the trendline.....I don't think you can get rid of human interaction to be profitable in forex....I like driving the firebird ea but it truely needs to be driven...consitantly.

Here is a "freehand" trendline alert indicator. This was formerly an EA that was converted to an indicator. I think this is something that could be programed into the EA. When the trendline is broken an alert signal is received by the EA to close the trades. This indicator does not work on the strategy tester. You can draw as many trendlines as you want on your chart and it will send email or popup or sound alerts. I am going to use it along with the heiken ashi and the THV3 Trend Alert. Here is the link with the instructions.  
  
<http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=15197>  
  
Samurai I think this is what you were looking for.  
  
P.S. I just found a modified version that lets you set alerts for all kinds of lines. i.e. fibs, tl , rectangles circles etc.

Agree with you on the trend line. The indicator that you have find could be a portion of the answer. I will study it to see what we can do with it inside the Firebird. This will go inline with Samurai idea.

I am going to back test this idea against the rules in the first post for the period 1/2/09-4/10/09.  
  
I will run the data two ways.  
  
#1 - Entry will be the next candle after the 5/8 EMA indicator forms arrow and exit will be when the Heiken Ashi Candle changes color. This means that trades could run over the weekend.  
  
#2 - Entry will be the same as #1 but with this exception. Trades will start at 0 GMT Monday if rules are met as in post#1 of this thread. Exit#1 - all trades will be closed manually on Friday by end of business day broker time.. Exit#2 - all trades for a currency pair will be closed if the 4 hr trendline is broken. The idea is that if the 4hr chart is only retracing it will not break the trendline. If it breaks the trendline then close all trades for the currency pair. The heiken Ashi and the THV trend still are needed as there are certain market conditions where the trendline will not be the best indicator to close trades. The trendline will help for extreme market reversals where the Heiken ashi and the THV3 trend help to show market momentum slowing and give you time to react.   
  
Hopefully will be able to post this by monday. I will try to put in on an excel spreadsheet.

My only problem is I've read most of your posts and I'm a bit confused on what the final system is at this point in time for me to start.   
I realize your still making changes. But if someone could put up a zip with some instructions and/or settings I hope to be able to help with my results.

The trick to this whole Firebird system is balancing the pip step, take profit and being consistant with entry and exit rules....I am in the middle of testing and already see some new ideas....I will keep everyone posted. I wish you could set the simulator to the exact time of day to start and stop rather than having to start at GMT 0. Another need would be to have it stop on a certain price...any suggestions?  
  
If anyone knows how to do this please post.

Thank you for your direction in this matter.   
  
One quick question I have two EAs one is the "Firebird-63HO4 (EA) 5 Digit Platform" and another "Firebird v63g trader seven".   
  
I have no idea how I ended up with two but should I stay with the Firebird-63HO4 (EA) 5 Digit Platform.  
  
Thanks again for the help and I can't wait for the market to open this week to try this out.

Buy **EUR / USD** at **1.3214**  
Set your target at **1.3336**  
Set your stop loss at **1.3184**  
At **1.3259** Move your Stop loss to Breakeven  
  
Short sell **EUR / USD** at **1.3136**  
Set your target at **1.3014**  
Set your stop loss at **1.3166**  
At **1.3091** Move your Stop loss to Breakeven  
  
  
Put both in at the same time as buy and sell stops.  
  
Good Luck,

> Here is a "freehand" trendline alert indicator. This was formerly an EA that was converted to an indicator. I think this is something that could be programed into the EA. When the trendline is broken an alert signal is received by the EA to close the trades. This indicator does not work on the strategy tester. You can draw as many trendlines as you want on your chart and it will send email or popup or sound alerts. I am going to use it along with the heiken ashi and the THV3 Trend Alert. Here is the link with the instructions.

Hi Samurai,  
i'm studying the object oriented code in order to incorporate your idea and the Alerter code(provided by Nam) into the EA. I'm not familiared with this type of code so it will take some time to understand it and debug. I will let you know when i will have a prototype to test.

Yes Actionpl, the combine of "firebird" EA engine and drawing line "Allert" indis will provide us more safe way to drive. Coz our concern here are:  
  
"what if we are not in front of the screen when the trend reverse?", and  
"How much the cost that we have to pay when we miss the trend reversal?"  
  
And for most of us it's difficult to sleep peacefully with the EA running and worrying if the trend reverse, tell me if i'm wrong.  
  
This idea will answer those question and worriness, coz we define the "Trade Area" and "Not Trade Area" for the EA to run, with "stop" function and "close all trade" option we will cut drawdown very significant.  
  
And for newbie  
One more thing, Bank's is the major player in forex, NOT US, coz they hold the money in a very large quantity, when they put the money in then the market will react, when they want the trend up then they will do that and vice versa, they dont like if we won, they will do anything to get our money, so be sure to follow them if we want to profit consistantly, and guess what they are using to play the market? the answer is "LINE", S&R line, fibonacci and trendline, they dont use indicator coz its lag and repaint, so u better read this pdf article coz its a good way to start.

So the combined EA will prevent them from taking our green pips, keep riding them but we have a prevention tool when those major player go against us, and importantly get rid of emotion part to make driving a lot easier.  
  
Actionpl,.. personally I thank so much u for willing to code my idea, and also for Nam and ollypips for inspiring me.

Yes roselyn, the EA will only run if your computer and internet connection is on, the solution is by putting your platform into a server then you can free to turn your computer off.

Hi to everybody who used those EA with the alert function. Please change your version to this corrected version vs1. The old one will produce alert many time in a given period of the Heiken Ashi.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)

Yes RJ1,  
  
I've tasted it too, i'm waiting for actionpl and maybe another humble programer to combine the code of EA and indis I posted earlier, hopefully we can minimize drawdown significantly and much easier to drive without emotion intach, it means that we can play bigger lotsize and douibling ouir acc in no time (yea I wish..)

Hi all,  
  
Today 14/04/09, based on H4 TF, based on MTF CCI 14 and in10tion indicators on H4, I took long position for E/U and G/U. Until now, the EA already took 3 positions (2 E/U and 1 G/U). At the current moment, the situation not looking so good because both currencies are heading south.   
  
_**E/U**_  
Although the 4H Trix for E/U is now red in H4, I am not closing E/U position yet, because both CCI and in10tion are still positive. Both E/U trades are now about -40pips. I am waiting if the price bounce up in the M5 trendline.  
  
_**G/U**_  
4H Trix is now yellow but CCI and in10tion are still positive. So, I am not closing the trade yet. Currently -16pips. I am waiting if the price will bounce on M5 trendline.  
  
  
_**Note:**_ Why not close the trades when Trix shows yellow? This is experimental, I am trying to determine which indicators to be the main indicator to follow. We'll see the result.   
  
Below are the trades taken by the EA.  
  
Currency: EUR/USD  
Bought: 1.33305  
Stoploss: 1.30305  
TakeProfit: 1.34305  
  
Currency: EUR/USD  
Bought: 1.32899  
Stoploss: 1.29899  
TakeProfit: 1.33899  
  
Currency: GBP/USD  
Bought: 1.48627  
Stoploss: 1.45627  
TakeProfit: 1.49627  
  
Will post the result.

These new ea's are for signals only correct,,,not automated. Do i have to draw trendlines or does the EA take care of that?

Where can one get the MTF CCI 14 indicator shown by Namrettik?  
(I've searched all over and can't seem to find it anywhere)

I Samurai, i have finally incorporate your idea with Namrettik idea.  
This EA allow you to disactivate the trade if the Heiken Ashi is agains your driving condition (If Manage_Trade is = true). It will also stop all trading if it break the Trend line that you have manually draw on the Chart(if TrendAnalysis is true). Those features can be activated or disactivated by the EA property in the input folder.   
To activate the Trend analysis, you need to establish a Trend line and you need to give it a description with the following format:   
...XXXXX...YYYYY_ZZ  
XX is for a trend line name (could be nothing)  
YYYY need to be Alert (if you want the alert to be activated)  
_ This caracter is required  
ZZ The amount of pip that you want to have this alert activated  
EX. My trendline Alert_20  
This description of the trend line will activate an alert when price is in the range of 20 pip of your trend line. If you set up variable emailalert at true in the trendline analysis section of the EA input it will send you an email, Same for the popup variable.  
  
To set this trendline description you need to double clic on the trendline, then right clic while having your cursor on the trend line, you will see a popup window with trendline properties, clic on trendline properties, you will have the popup window with the description field blank. Double clic on the description field and enter your alert as described above.  
  
Once the trend line alert is triggered by price actions, the EA will not generate new trade anymore but will continue to monitor your open trades. To reset your EA, you need to enter into the EA property (F7) window and clic OK.  
  
One more thing. With this version you don't need to have the 5 min chart display(you should not if you want to have a meaningfull trend). Select the timeframe on which you want to place your trendline and trace it.   
  
For those of you who want to trade on an other timeframe than 5 min, you need to change the variable Chart_Time_Frame in the EA properties at the section for FireBird.  
  
Hope their is no bugs in the code. Test it and let me know  
  
I encourage people to let us know what will be the best parameters to produce positive Pips.  
  
Have a good evening to all.

Hi Samurai,  
  
I think your smtp server for yahoomail can be googled, while the username is your userid and password is ur password.  
  
Regarding this EA, when you drive short on aug 2008 it gets 3094 pips while the close - start of the trend shows 1067 pips because it opens new positions on the daily trend every 30-40 pips along the short trend. This means you are gaining pips exponentially rather than linearly. Is this correct? So assuming this is how it works, why do we need to complicate things and turn the EA off when the daily trend shows us it changed. It is easy to just reverse the condition and drive your shorts to longs automatically in code. Just do buys instead of calls and vice versa. I already did this in the EA and am testing it.  
  
This is how I think it works, looking at the code:  
  
start()  
  
1) make sure orders < maxorders  
2) Setup Pipstep  
3) Check divergence < divergencelimit (why do we need this????)  
4) Enter position   
\- this is the interesting part ( it checks moving avg and RVI to see if its a BUY or SELL, unless you set flag to ONLY BUYS or ONLY SELLS. And it only buys and sells every Pipstep Pips.   
5) KeepTrackOfStopLoss(averageopeningprice)  
These are the comments from the code on this step:   
"  
//----------------------- KEEP TRACK OF STOPLOSS TO AVOID RUNAWAY MARKETS  
// Sometimes the market keeps trending so strongly the system never reaches it's target.  
// This means huge drawdown. After stopping out it falls in the same trap over and over.  
// The code below avoids this by only accepting a signal in teh opposite direction after a SL was hit.  
// After that all signals are taken again. Luckily this seems to happen rarely.   
"  
\- I'm not sure why we need this if we are only driving one way(can we delete this function?)  
  
  
So what I did was between step 3 and 4 I checked with the trend indicator running on the daily chart to see if the trend is long or short then place all orders and buys and sells respectively every Pipstep Pips. This would basically allow it to run without interference EXCEPT for sideway trends, if the trend isn't Pipstep Pips big, then it will retrace and you will lose that money most likely. We can handle that if we can detect sideways trends from the trend indicator, or say after 2 stop losses just wait until we get to a trend that passes the Pipstep barrier then place your orders every Pipstep Pips.  
  
  
Maybe I am misunderstanding the code, but this is what I get from it. The way you are driving it, it's not really Firebird but a manual EA that just places orders every Pipstep (40 Pips) in the direction of the trend you manually set.

The Firebird's job is to open first trade in good position,..here this FB EA does nice work. It opens trade acourding divergence...after that, its all about pip step, T/P and S/L settings.

gasgas:  
  
Well it seems to be a test between moving averages. In any case the test usually passes so it is has minimal effect.   
  
Two things I think can improve on the EA:  
  
  
-Start with lower T/P, so that it builds up as more orders come in every Pipstep. Idea is to have carry momentum forward (snowball effect). This will allow you to save money during non-trending times as you won't spend as much by the time you get to the peak and the trend changes.  
-When the trend changes, cancel all orders. Most likely you are going to get a Stop loss anyways. This really depends on a good trend indicator, and if your indicator is set to HA indicator is set to daily with 1/2 settings its usually pretty good.  
-Automatically switch between long/short version of this EA  
  
I think this will allow you to atleast break even on non trending but make a bigger profit on large up/down trends. I am working on modifying the EA to test for these heuristics.

Hi, on the SMTP server: place your server name that you will find under your outlook express accompte. Go on the tool menue and accompte submenue and look at the mail folder. Reproduce your pop3.accompte information. If it is not setup, you will need to ask your internet provider to provide you the SMTP server for mail. You don't need to enter nothing on SMTP login and SMTP Password since your system is already log to the internet to run Metatrader.

Hi, i have add some new features on this version vs1_1.  
Now you can have the EA waiting for a pattern that you draw on the chart with trend lines. When price action will hit your trend line, it will start to trade normally. If it reverse and hit a second trend line it will stop trading as version vs1.   
  
You can activate this trend watch feature by having variable TrendLine_watch set to true.  
  
An other feature is you can have your stoploss reduce by a factor when the trendline is hit after trading normally. So if you set variable "Reduce_factor" at something different than zero, it will divide your stoploss value by the amount that you have enter. Ex. A stoploss of 3000 will become 1500 on a 5 digit broker.  
  
Also this version have setup for a 5 digit broker.  
  
Those feature should help us to have more free time and not look at the screen for pattern. So we can plan to enter trading when a specific pattern will be in place. So if it happen overnight, we will not miss it.  
P.S. When we do this kind of pattern watching, we should have the EA ready to go long or short, at our next check, we can change it to the way we think it will for the next trend.  
  
Have fun testing it. Hoppefully it will bring more pips to our accounts.

I do not put the EA on 5Min chart coz I set the input "Chart_time_frame" to 5M and drive the EA "Long only",  
"Trendanalisys" set to true  
"Manage_trade" set to true  
"Heiken_Ashi_Timeperiod" set to 1440 (daily).  
The above trendline are is the area i wish to trade, and below trendline area is where the EA stop trading untill I adjust the EA and trendline again.  
  
am i doing the right way? coz since yesterday it doesnt open trade.  
I compare it with FB.v63 original on EU it was open trade, but FB.v63H04 Haiken Ashi trend didnt open trade since yesterday on GU (based on my experience FB.v63 original will open trade with that kind of candle formation).  
or maybe its design for 4 digit broker only? coz im using [fxpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") 5 digit platform.  
Need an explanation, much better with pic illustration, thx actionpl.  
  
Regards,  
Samurai Power

Hi, there is no promp for time input. If you want to select some time you need to setup variable TradeFrom1 and TradeUntil1 with your time you want the EA to be trading. Make sure to setup the GMT variable and DST variable as well if you want to be accurate.  
  
I've not tested this feature.

Hi Actionpl or anybody,  
  
I put vs1_1 on 5 Min chart with THV V3 template, but since last night to now, more than 8 hours later, it did no trade.  
  
This is full automated, right? Do I need to put any indicators on the chart? Do I need 4 hour or daily chart? Do I need to use tpl file?   
  
Thanks and very much appreciated

Hi Samurai, Yes your setup is ok. If your not sure about your setup, you can use the simulator to try it.  
P.S. Version v1 was with parameters setup to a 4 digit broker. Version 1_1 is setup to a 5 digit broker. You can adjust those parameters to your prefered one. They have change position in the list of variable but are doing the same action than before those change. If you want to emulate the old program, you need to put both parameters at false. ("Trendanalisys" set to false and "Manage_trade" set to false.

First off, hats off to Samurai for the system. I think for some of us "newbies" having a system that's part manual and part EA is a great way to learn and forces one to learn and not sit and pray an total automatic EA is going to work right.  
  
My first question is, having limited time during the day as I work 8:00am to 5:00pm (and going home for lunch) and not having time to always monitor trends (have MetaTrader Mobile on my phone to check on trades), which time frames are going to be the best, daily charts (that I can check in the morning and at night) or 4 hour charts (that I can check in the morning, noon and at night) .  
  
My next question, which appears to be the best pairs for this system?  
  
My last question, I've read the documentation on the system and I just want to make sure I have it. We ONLY set the trade direction and start the EA to trade when we have an arrow and candle going in the SAME direction and ONE candle after ALSO going the same direction correct?

Hi Samurai, Thanks for your testing, you have found a bug in the programmation. The bug was associated with variable "Manage_trade". When this variable was set to false there was no trade with version 1_1.  
  
Hi shisuyu, I have also check the code for time setting and those function were not working since the code was using a obsolete function call.  
So now in this new version, it is fixed. You have two way to control the execution of the EA,  
First, you can set Variable "TradeFromx and TradeUntilX" for a specific hour.  
(Server time not your local time)   
Ex. "TradeFrom1=0" and TradeUntil1=5" This will enable your EA to trade from 0hr 0 min to 5hr 59 min. You can specify 4 time frame with those variables. Make sure they are mutually exclusive. If not, you will end up with the minimum hour to the max hour of the day. Assuming that your server is at GMT hour. If your server is at Tokio time zone, the hour you enter will be the Tokio time.  
The second Parameters are GMT, DST,OpenningHour and ClosingHour. This will do the same fonction than the previous paragrah but it allow you to enter you local time in the OpenningHour and ClosingHour as long as you have setup the right GMT offset at variable GMT and if you are on Day saving Time you need to put 1 or 0 at variable DST.  
So in summary, you have 5 ways to select the trading window.   
Your top left scren will show "Bad hour" with the OpenningHour et ClosingHour and trade disable with the "TradeFrom and TradeUntil" variables.  
  
So i have fix the program and now the version 1_2 fix both problem. None trading situation and the Time setup.

Will this version work both on a 4 and 5 digit broker. Do we adjust the settings accordingly to reflect a 4 or 5 digit borker?

Hi Actionpl,  
  
I have a few question about vs 1_2.  
Does the EA able to recognize wich "Trade Area" and "Not Trade Area"   
determined by a trendline I draw?  
ex.  
On long trade  
**Above** trendline area is **"Trade Area"** but,  
  
On short trade  
**Above** trendline area is **"Not Trade Area".**  
  
One more thing, I try to test the EA to open trade, I compare it between FB v63HO4_HA_trend_vs1_2 and FB v63g. As we can see that the major trend now is downtrend, to make the EA open trade quickly I set both EA to "Long Only" the result is  
FB v63g open trade in less than 10minute  
FB v63HO4_HA_trend_vcs1_2 and FB v63g doesnt open trade in more than 2hour.  
Any suggestion? thx  
  
Regards,  
Samurai Power

Hi, on a 4 digit broker you need to setup your variable to the # of pip that you are interested to trade on a 5 digit broker you need so multiply those value by 10.  
  
Ex. Pipstep 40 for 4 digit broler et 400 for the 5 digit.  
  
In version 1_2 i have regroup those variables together this is my setup for a 5 digits broker.  
slip = 100;   
SafeArea = 400;   
PipStep = 250;   
TakeProfit = 500;  
Stoploss = 3000;  
  
the 4 digits will be  
slip = 10;   
SafeArea = 40;   
PipStep = 25;   
TakeProfit = 50;  
Stoploss = 300;

Hi Samurai, on your first question here the answer:  
If you set up your EA with TrendAnalysis at true and TrendLine_watch at false, The EA will trade in the direction that we want irregardless of the trend line. So it is where you put your trend line that will make the difference. The trend line in your picture will do exactly what you have described. Trade above and stop trading if price action go below. If your place your trend line above the price action and you think that the market will go down, The EA will trade according to your setup up to the point it hit the trend line in case of a reverse action.  
  
IF variable Trendline_watch is set at true, The EA will not trade up to a point where the price action will hit a trendline with an alert setup. At this point, it will start to trade as if the Trendline_watch was set to false.  
  
For your question two, i need to compare the code of version 63G and 63H.  
I will let you know. It will take more time.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

Hi Samurai,  
i have look at the trigger mechanisim and version H have a concept of save area to trade, it adding the BullsPower with the Bearspower indicator as this  
Safe1 = iBullsPower(NULL,PERIOD_M15,20,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL,PERIOD_M15,20,6,0);  
If this somme of those two indicators fall inside the SaveArea variable, it allow the trade. So if you want to simulate more closely the G version change this parameter for a bigger number as 5000 and try it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Doing this searh i have found an other problem that would have prevent the closing of the stoploss and take profit if we had change the timeperiod chart display after the initialisation and kept it at the other timeperiod.   
So i will publish version 3 over the weekend with this fix and a more meaninfull message on the top of the screen to allow us to know what is the configuration that is being run.  
  
Thanks for your time testing this EA.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Bravo! Bravo!! Bravo!!! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44f.png?v=15.1)  
  
100 Kudos ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f918.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) goes to Samuria and Actionpl for the great work you guys are doing. But the bottom line is, I won't want us to transform this EA from its orinal concept while we optimize it for greater performance, because this EA is one of the BEST PERFORMING EA I have used so far (The original ones are still making money). So, please, guys, keep in mind the real and original concept of this great EA while you do the great and selfless work you do, we appreciate everything.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
Thanks guys and God bless you.  
Ayo.

Can you also add a trailing stop function into it(for 4 and 5 digit borkers),please. I have not tested the new version so I don't know if its there already.

Thanks.  
  
By "GU" and "EU" pair I take it you mean the "GBP/USD" and "EUR/USD" pairs correct (still learning)?

Thanks SamuraiPower and contributors for your great methods.  
I have been forward testing the original method for two weeks and have 1100 pips with no losses, ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f4aa.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60f.png?v=15.1) so you have my attention.  
I will re-read the posts, structure more forward testing and post the results.  
  
Thanks again to all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yes TTUniverse,  
  
It works great spescially when u expert on recognizing the major trend on daily chart, but sometimes market reverse extreemly and eat our green pips alive, that what i'm affraid of. And sometimes emotion involved too much and thats makes us confuse especially in difficult market, reducing green pips that should've been in our pocket, or even minus. This idea will give us a "Walk Away System" according to a trendline that we specify to turn the EA off automaticly if the trend reverse suddenly so we can cut losses.  
  
Gasgas,  
I like EA, PA, TL, S&R line, and think we have the same interest, combining all of them, less stres, less screen time, less emotion, less drawdown, are my dreams. I am really eager to test it out with different setting and I will post the most profitable setting here, just wait for actionpl doing his great job for us all. thx actionpl.

Hi all, SamuraiPower, gasgas, Namrettik, Alcazer, and others. Hope you are well - haven't been here for a while.   
I like the latest thinking about trendlines to either alert the trader, or automatically limit position opening.  
In this regard, wouldn't it be good to have two classes of trendlines: one to halt the opening of new positions and one to kill off existing positions?  
I attach an image to illustrate: The price action broke the 'halt new' trendline, but then went lower again. In this case the existing trades would not have been killed off, but if price would have hit the 'kill off' trendline they would have.  
Awaiting your thoughts on this. And by the way: thanks to Actionpl for coding.  
Good luck to all  
D

I know we have discussed this option before and I still think this would be a good option for the trader to have. Can we add the close trade option to the EA. What do everyone else think.

Hi to all, Divyendu, this version can do pratically what you have proposed in customizing the variables.  
Vs 1.3 include a Trailing Stop feature. For those of you who want to use it.  
This feature does not work well in a none trending market. You need to have trend with a slope of at least 30 degree according to my experience.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
It work this way: If variable "TrailingStopFlag" is set at true, the EA will analyse your trade and switch from Stoploss to a trailing stop when the following condition is met: If the trade is at "TStrigger" pips from your "TakeProfit" value, it will switch to a trailing stop according to variable "TrailingStop".![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
The other feature that will do most of what Divyendu is proposing is the following:  
If variable "TrendAnalysis" and "ChangeOrder" are true, when the treend line with an Alert is hit, it will reduce the stoploss by a factor equivalent to what is in variable "Reduce_Factor" Exemple. You have a stop loss of 3000 and the trendline is hit. At the next tic, the Stoploss will be reduce to 1500 if you have set variable "Reduce_Factor" to 2. So, during the trading scession, we place a first trend line and wait, if it is hit, it will reduce your stop loss according to variable Reduce_factor. At this time this variable may be set at 2, it allow more freedom to the price action. At that point you can draw an other trend line (like Divyendu propose for his close) but this time you change the Reduce_factor to 20. So what will happen, the EA will place the stoploss at "slip" point away from the market. Variable "slip" is in the the Firebird section. The default value of "slip" is 100, if you put it to tight, the modify order will be rejected in high volatility price action.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also in this version i have fix the problem associate to changing the time period while it was trading. So now you can do whatever you want with the chart and the EA is still using the chart time period describe in variable "Chart_Time_frame".  
  
The last change is in the Status of the EA in Yellow at top of the screen, it represent the choice that you have made in the TrendAnalysis section.  
  
Lastly: here the setup summary for different configuration  
For vs G emulation.  
Set all variables to false for TrendAnalysis, ManageTrade, TrailingStop and set variable "safearea" at 10,000.  
For Vs H03: Set all variables to false for TrendAnalysis, ManageTrade and TrailingStop.  
If you don't want to take any trade if the Heiken Ashi is agains your prevision set variable "manage_Trade" at true.  
To activate Trend Analysis, set your variable "TrendAnalysis" at true.  
Look at post of v1.1 and 1.2 to have more detail of how it work.  
P.S. Make sure to set the description of your trend line as described in previous post in order to have this feature work. Also, once a trend line is hit, the Description is reset to remove the Alarm setup and you need to reinitialise the EA to get out of the "Broken trend" state.   
  
Now we have a EA with an autopilot and alarms. As Samurai is saying, it should provide us with more free time and less preoccupation about what is happening on the market. But you need to look at your chart twice a day in order to do the adjusment required and optimize your trading strategy.  
  
I did test those features and everything seem to work as plan. I count on you guys to test it even further in order to get all the bugs out.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)  
  
Have a good trading week.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1)

Hi Nam,  
  
I think the EA have Close all position feature, if u set the variable "Manage_trade" to true then it will close opening position when Heiken Ashi candle close against our order. Or with trendline trigger, if u set the "Reduce_factor" to a higher number let say 20 times, then it will close all position at that spasific price+ "slip" variable. Hope thats help.

Hi actionpl,  
  
Testing vs1_3 now, On EU daily chart, I put the EA and I drive "Short Only". I see a notification on the upper left corner on the chart. It says : "Trade disable - Waiting for trendline activation". I need suggestion, do we need to wait for trendline activation to allow the EA to trade eventhough Im in "Short only" mode and in the "Trade area"? Thx action

Hi. I may be interpreting this incorrectly but are you moving away from your approach on Trend detection of HAS & Signal Arrow to alternative approaches?  
  
Thanks

Hi, you have this status because you have set variable "Trendline_watch" and "TrendAnalysis" at true. In this case yes you need to set a trend line and when the market hit it, the EA will start to trade. Then you can have an other trend line to stop the EA if it goes again your position.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Try it with only "TrendAnalysis set at true" The EA will directly go trading and look for a trendline with an alert before stopping trading.

Hi actionpl,  
  
Oo..ok I got the wrong perception then.  
  
So when i set "Trend Analisys" to true and "Trendline Watch" to false, does the EA reduce stoploss or close trades automaticly when the price go against me and touch the trendline?  
  
So what is the correct setting if I want the FB engine directly to trade as long as my position is in the correct area without having a trendline for an activation to trade and when the price goes against me and touch the trendline the EA will reduce SL or close opening position automaticly? i.e just like on the pic on my earlier post. Thx

Hi Actionpl  
  
Any reason why magic number is not amongst ext values? I can't find the global variable that is supposed to create it. Is it created automatically? Will the EA ignore manual trades on the same chart?  
  
Can't find the function 'ChangeOrder' [extern int ChangeOrder = ] in the code. Is that the one that halts new trades and alters TS on existing ones?

TrendAnalysis = true  
Trendline_Watch = False  
Manage_Trade = T  
  
The following is my understanding and questions about the settings. I am still a little unclear about the settings of the ea. The above are my settings but I am not sure if it will open any trades. I have it running on the EURUSD and do not have any current trades open. I am short only on this currency pair.   
  
My understanding is with trendAnalysis set to true it will stop trading when the trendline that I draw that has an alert set will stop trading when it hit that line. Is it also true that you can have as many trendlines on your chart as long as your trendline you are using as a no trade line are the only ones with an alert set on it. (ie. I have a diagonal trendline with an alert set for my trendline and a horizotal trendline as a close order line. In other words the ea will ignore the other trendlines on my chart and will only acknowledge trendlines with alerts set on them.   
  
With Trenline_watch = false the ea will trade until it hits my trendline that has an alert on it.... If I set it to true, how exactly would you set this up. I am not sure how you would use this....  
  
Manage_trade = T does this setting work the same was as Trendanalysis except that it is triggered by the Heiken Ashi Candle only.

Hi, i see that you did some work while i was working.   
So for this question:   
With this setup, The EA will reduce your trade(s) if it goes against your trendline with an Alarm in the description if your Variable "Reduce_Factor" is set to a number bigger than zero.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Setup should be  
TrendAnalysis = true  
Trendline_watch = false  
Reduce_factor = 2, it can be any number different than 0. If it is 0, it will not change the stoploss. A setting of 2, it will reduce the stoploss by 50%.

Hi Divyendu, yes the magic# is created automatically using this formula  
int MagicNumber=0;   
for (int i=0; i<5; i++)   
{   
MagicNumber=MagicNumber*3+StringGetChar(Symbol(),i);   
}   
MagicNumber=MagicNumber*3+Chart_Time_Frame;   
return(MagicNumber);   
So if is fonction of the symbol and the variable Chart_Time_Frame.  
  
Will the EA ignore manual trades on the same chart?  
Yes, unless you giveit a magic# that meet the formula above.

See my answer in **bold character** in the text below.  
  
The following is my understanding and questions about the settings. I am still a little unclear about the settings of the ea. The above are my settings but I am not sure if it will open any trades. I have it running on the EURUSD and do not have any current trades open. I am short only on this currency pair.   
**Answer: Your understanding is right.** **If you want to force a trade in a rapid changing environment as today, you need to increase the "SaveArea" variable in the Firebird section.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)**  
  
My understanding is with trendAnalysis set to true it will stop trading when the trendline that I draw that has an alert set will stop trading when it hit that line. **YES**  
  
Is it also true that you can have as many trendlines on your chart as long as your trendline you are using as a no trade line are the only ones with an alert set on it. (ie. I have a diagonal trendline with an alert set for my trendline and a horizotal trendline as a close order line. In other words the ea will ignore the other trendlines on my chart and will only acknowledge trendlines with alerts set on them. **YES**  
  
With Trenline_watch = false the ea will trade until it hits my trendline that has an alert on it.... If I set it to true, how exactly would you set this up. I am not sure how you would use this.... **Answer: With this variable set at true, the EA will wait to hit a trend line with an alert before starting to trade. Then it will act as if the Trendline_watch variable was set to false.**  
  
Manage_trade = T does this setting work the same was as Trendanalysis except that it is triggered by the Heiken Ashi Candle only.   
**No, Manage_Trade will do exactly what you have requested. It will prevent a trade in the direction agains your choice. according to Heiken Ashi indicator. Ex. It will trade only short if the candle is red. You can select on which time frame you want this indicator and you can select which candle you want to monitor by changing variable "Index". If you select the current candle, use 0. But make sure to set your email variable to false if you select the current candle. If you want the previous candle set it to 1.  
  
Hope this clarify how this work.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi Nam,  
  
For now i'm testing how the TL works to cut loses, so I draw TL quite close to the price to make it hits the TL quickly, after im sure there is no bug and works for about 2 week to 1 month then I will trade it on live regardles my pda on reparation or not ha..ha...   
But I do draw line based on S&R line (no brainer thread is a good one to learn) , trendline on 4H chart based on PA slope just like I used to draw in the earlier of this thread (psiholog is expert on this one). I will post the TL pic as soon as i finish testing the function of the new EA. Cheers

Hi Namrettik, if you are trading with a 5 digit broker an Alert_10 provide you only a window of 2 pip to detect the trend. So in a fast market, the EA may end up missing the Alarm. So i suggest to use nothing below 20. In my simulation it happen to me, so in foward testing we will have to pay attention to this detail.

Hi. I have firebird on demo at present and its doing ok. Couple of questions I wanted to ask you:  
  
1\. What are you using at present to determine the long term trend? Have you changed from using HAS & Signal Arrows?  
  
2\. At present, I have a series of messages coming up saying "excessive loss" Now the loss really ain't that much at all but there must be some tight setting I have in the EA. Can you advise please how I switch this message off?  
  
Thanks

Your right. so your trend line will be hit when price go at 20 pip from the trend line on either side. Wo it is a window of 40 pips.

yes im still using the template on my 1st post, but what we are trying to do now is to minimize drawdown when trend reversal occur by adding a trendline recognition to the ea.   
About the alert its in the code and i can do nothing but by disabling alert option might help u.

This message appear when you doing live trading and that the trade that you have is generating a high rate of loss. Variable "PippsLoss" will affect this message. IF you increase this variable, it mean that you can manage a higher rate of loss. It is a warning that your account is going in the wrong direction. If you don't want to see that set your variable "writelog" at 0,

Thanks. One of the indicators i use to give me an idea as to the direction of the trend is the Laguerre on a higher TF. It gives a reasonably good overview and when the Laguerre starts to flatten out, you take the trades off the table and wait for a turn up or for Laguerre to start falling again. Ok its not perfect but it should keep you out of trouble  
  
Any thoughts on Laguerre?

Using the approach in your first post, do you get a "neutral" stance on Cable right now? Yes HAS bars are pointing down but the signal arrow is up after yesterdays upward correction.   
  
I am standing aside today until I see a down arrow appear or alternatively, HAS turns positive. Whichever is first  
  
Also , typically on a given move, do you stick to 100pips TP all the way every day or do you change this as the move goes on over time?  
  
Thoughts?

Hi vnath,  
  
Sometimes if HA and the arrow is not in line I got confuse, most of the time I turn the EA off. And i do stick with 100 TP for GU and EU (Most of the time).

Hi Actionpl,  
  
I was way to busy and happy to look my chart again. I run EA on my VPS and this pic below is a chart from my computer so there is no trendline in there, but still i can know how the EA works.  
By looking of what happen in the last 2 day I see that the trendline on the EA doesnt seems to work. "Trend_analisys" true and "Trendline_Watch" false. Any suggestion??

Samurai,  
  
Here is a screenhot of my EURUSD trade. I have the same setting you do. When the price hit the trendline this morning the stoplosses were reduced by 2 per my settings. However, I noticed another trade was opened above the trendline. Need help on this to understand settings. Looks like it should not have opened another trade.

I've been using the "Channel Surfer" indicator for trend lines.  
Anyone got any ideas as to what the best setting for "AllBars" and "BarsForFract" parameters are?  
  
I'm using the default of..  
  
AllBars = 240  
BarsForFract = 0  
  
And I notice that that the trend lines are not accurate.

Hi Samurai,  
in order to get a good understanding of how this EA work with trend line do the following.  
1- Set your EA as describ in your post  
2- Set your chart on a timeperiod of 1 minutes  
3- Draw a trend line very close above and below the current price action  
4- Draw a horizontal trend line below(or above) the current price action  
5- Set the Alert in the description box as shown below(picture)  
6- Wait for the Price Action to break on of the trend line  
You should see in the upper left corner the message Trend broken  
7- Look at the description of the trend line that have been broken, the description will have been change and they is no more an alert associate to it.  
8- To restart the trading, you need to go in EA property and clic on OK.  
9- continue testing by adding an alert to the trend line that was broken

Thanks Namrettik, i will check that. I noticed that you have popup to true.  
Have you got a poppup when it broke the trend?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Let me know, it will held to understand the situation. Normally you should not got an other trade and you should have the message on the top left saying that the trend was broken.

Hi Actionpl,  
  
Yes I've tried that in but in 5 min chart, with "Trend_analisys" true and "Trendline_Watch" false i dont have to wait for the price to hit trendline first to trade. My setting just look like Nam posted earlier, and it didint stop openig trade when the price hits and above trendline.

Hi ByerRA,  
  
I tried with different setting but sometimes it draw the TL in the wrong way, for best result just draw TL by yourself and the indis act as a suplement for your chart.

I got an alert when the price action was within 20 pips of my trendline. I watched price action cross the trendline and then another trade opened above the trendline.

Hi Actionpl,  
  
I've been using Firebird-v63H04_Heiken_Ash_vs1.mq4 test M5, the default parameter settings, eur / usd gbp / usd usd / cad usd / chf usd / jpy eur / chf at a fixed time period of the transaction, the success rate is relatively high, simulation test account is normal, you can at the same time multi-currency transactions on my account in a real transaction, the transaction can only be a single currency, what is the need to change the parameters?   
My time is GMT +2 platform fixed in the platform so that 16 o'clock time EA started trading, before the 5 pm close out all of the manual list.

Hi. What method are you using to determine the bigger trend and therefore whether to set the EA to Long Only or Short Only or Stand aside?

I may be misinterpreting but to look at 1min charts seems to be too much driving of this system? I thought the objective here was to look at the bigger timeframes like Daily Charts and then from there, set the EA to long or short only or stand aside and to be in the same direction typically for days  
  
Does the above approach achieve this or is there alot of reviewing of charts etc involved? From my brief interaction with this system, the hope was 1) To identify the bigger daily trend 2) To set the EA to long , short or no trading and 3) To monitor the trend say twice daily and take appropriate actions  
  
Would welcome thoughts if I am misinterpreting the System

I have only small fluctuations in the market before the EA deal, use the default settings, Firebird-v63H04_Heiken_Ash_vs1.mq4 version not the beginning of the end of the transaction set time, the platform I am GMT +2, the platform began to 16:00 hours trading, before 5:00 Ping list out all that is in the Asian plate to unwind all of the list.

The system as I understand it is supposed to ever only be Long, Short or Neutral in its positioning. Are you saying you override this and trade it just as a standard EA long and short at the same time in the custom settings?

What i have suggest to use the 1min chart is only to debug the TrendAnalysis. In normal trading you should be on 4hr chart. The EA vs 1.3 does not take into account the timeframe of your chart.  
So you got the right idea, look only at the system twice a day to drive it the way you want.

Hi Namrettik and Samurai, i have been able to see what you have describe but only when variable PopupAlert= true.  
So could you test it with only variable TrendAnalysis=true.  
I'm investigating why in certain situation that the EA reset itself. On my system it seem to work fine, but i did not have the PopupAlert set at true.  
  
Thanks for your time![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Hi all  
Maybe one of you can clarify  
I have messages 'bad hours' (yes I know its midnight, but there is nothing to be afraid of. It's still only paper-trading after all - and yes, I have trade enabled - tried both 0 - 24 and 06 - 05), and on another 'not safe to trade'. I don't care if it is not safe. I want to go really fast round the circuit, and if I go off the track, just run into the wall of tyres, i.e. the 'Alert' trendline...  
Anyway What are the settings to adopt to not get these irritating messages?  
Thanks for your thoughts in advance  
D

Hi Divyendu, make sure to have those variables set like as follow to disable the bad hour message  
GMT = 0   
DST = 0  
OpeningHour = 0   
ClosingHour = 24  
To make sure that you are not going to have "Trade disable" message due to time, set the folowing variables this way:  
TradeFrom1 = 0  
TradeUntil1 = 24  
  
In order to desactivate the high volatility market verification set variable:   
SafeArea= 10000  
  
This should solve your irration. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi to all, i have made some modification to prevent the instabillity problem identivied by Samurai and Namrettik. I have not found any bugs but have change the logic in order to be more robust in time where the price action are rapidly changing. So take note of the following.  
  
1- When placing an alert on your trend, Make sure to have a Capital letter as your first letter of the alarm. Ex. Alarm_30. If it is not written this way, the EA will not take action on your trend. I recommend a minimum of 30 for a 5 digits broker et 3 pip for the 4 digits broker.  
  
2- I have made the comments on the top left side more meaninfull. It will help you to adjust "SaveArea" and "DivergenceLimit" variables. Those two variables are use to filter trade when the price action is too volatile. If you want to increase your risk level and have more trade adjust those variables according to the message that you will see. Message: "SaveArea too low: 500" meant that you need to put variable "SafeArea" larger than 500 in order to validate this market condition.  
Message "DivergenceLimit too low = 0.003" it mean that you have to increase variable "DivergenceLimit" in order to accept this market condition.  
  
I have validate on my system in foward testing mode and it is stable for friday market conditions. I have tested all alerts conditions with popup and email, everything is working on my system. Check it out and let me know what kind of error message that your are getting.   
  
Samurai and Nam, if you find again a trade after the trend have been broken, provide me a print screen of your chart and a print screen of the folder "Experts" in metatrader.   
P.S. make sure to not change the time frame of your chart since changing time frame will reinitialize the EA.   
P.S.2 Changing time period of your chart is an other way to get the EA out of the condition TrendLine Broken and start trading again.  
P.S.3 If you have multiple trend line with Alarm_xx the EA will toggle between active trading and disable trading each time it hit a trend with an Alarm_xx. This could be use for more elaborate trading strategy.  
  
Hope this version will be more stable and allow more free time to traders.

Actionpl,  
Can we not use Ichimoku Kinko Hyo (span a, span b) to come up with the resistance levels (window) we use to determine the stoploss reduction? That way if we are long and it goes way below span a we can reduce and do a cutoff on span b or reduce further, until price comes back within range, and we can even go back to normal stoploss if we come back within range.

Hi Jag, could you do a simulation with your idea. Take the historitical data and follow what you have in mind to establish those stop and see what kind of profit it will provide. I look rapidly at this indicator and it seem lag the system pretty much.  
  
Let us know if you find something interesting to analyse more.  
  
regards

I will modify the EA to use the indicator, and I will see where it goes. Right now I am optimizing the Your_lucky ea, a few days atleast.

I recently received a free indicator that I thought might be useful for determining the direction to drive the ea.  
  
Its call trend magic. Might be worth testing this week. I don't know if it repaints.  
  
EA and instructions included in the zip file.  
  
I hope this helps everyone.

hello!  
a question: does actionpl's EA make the whole thing automatic or do you still have to drive it?  
  
and please! can someone direct me to the part where nanningbob and namrettik found the inconsistencies in the ea?  
  
thank you!

kimchikim,  
  
U still have to drive it but its gonna be lot easier, I can say the energy u spend its almost the same like fully auto ea. Try vs1_3a u i think its a great improvement.  
  
  
Hi Actionpl,  
  
I found the vs1_3a works really well, just like what I wanted to, lets see on more test hopefully no other bugs. Many..many...thanx actionpl.

The vs1_3a works but the question is, what is the actual time frame you place the EA, because I placed one on a 5M TF with HAS set to 240 TF and trendline drawn from 4HRs TF, and another on a 4HRs TF with HAS set to 240TF, and I'm kind of getting similar result. I remember we palce the original version on a 5M TF and drive it in the direction of the longer TF like daily, do we still follow this technique here?.  
  
TIA.  
Ayo.

Hi ayoneeyee, whatever the chart you are placing the EA it will have the same results since it is not fonction of the timeperiod that is on your chart.  
This allow you to draw your trend line on any time period.  
  
If you want to change the time period that you want to place the EA on, you need to change the following variable "Chart_Time_Frame" in the FireBird section. So if you want the EA to take decision base on 30 minutes charts, assign to this variable 30. ex. Chart_Time_Frame=30  
  
Hope this clarify your results.  
P.S. Remember, you will have to fine tune all the other parameters that have been setup on the EA for 5 min. Try it and let us know your results.  
  
bye  
  
ActionPl.

Everett,  
I too an interested in that indicator. Please post here if you discover anything. They apparently are priming the market and gathering email addresses for an EA to be released soon. If it is based on some public code from one of these forums, I would prefer to have the actual code.

Working with indicators is not as good as mathematically deriving your longs/shorts. This is why firebird is good because you are using your own intuition to come up with the trend.

Hi SamuraiPower,  
Thank you very much for sharing your trading strategy. I’ve been following this thread for a few weeks now and have gone live with your system about 2 weeks ago with pretty good success. Due to my own blunders though I lost all my profit this week. I have to learn to be patient. But anyway I was wondering if there was information available concerning the function of some of the settings in the latest version ea. For example:  
“Section for Trend Analysis”  
Trend Analysis – False (should these be set to true?)  
Trenline Watch – False  
Change order – 1  
Reduce Factor – 2.0  
“Section for Autotrade”  
Manage Trade – False (is this the same as money management?)  
Index – 1  
I’m not really sure the function of these and many of the other settings. Thanks for all your help.

Hi Samurai and Namrettik, i got a fast action price on AudUsd this morning and i had an Alert set at 30 and it when through whithout trigging the alert. So 30 as a minimum does not seem to be enough. I will increase my minimum to 40.  
  
I thing we should have a safety net. What do you think about the following idea. Instead of looking only for Alert_xx in the description, i can make it to look for "Trend_Down_Alert_xx" or "Trend_Up_Alert_xx".  
  
If the user set the alarm this way, i can have the EA stop trading even if hit gap across the trend.   
  
This will allow us also to activate an other feature such as to trig a trade when we are in trend watch and when it hit our trend but still inside the window set by the alarm.  
  
In this case you will put in the description of the trend something like:  
"Trend_Down_Trade_Alert_xx" or "Trend_Up_Trade_Alert_xx"  
In this case, the EA will initiate a trade according to our trend setup and only if the price action is inside the window define by xx.  
  
Do you think that is worth to do that. It will make the EA more complex to setup. I can program it in such a way that if those key word are not there, it will continue to work as of vs1_3a  
  
What do you think?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
I have been dealling with different versions of Firebird for a while already with actually no succes. I have ran through this thread and found the idea of manual driving the EA very interesting and in fact the most profitable of all I've tried so far. Anyway seeing Your work to make the EA fully automatic I started to think about EA's in totally different perspective. I might be totally wrong however I think it might be worth a try, not only with Firebird but with other EA's as well.   
Since most EA's evetuallly fail I started to think what would happen if the trade opening functions got reversed so that the EA instead of going long would go short in the same market setup.  
Since I have no proramming skills at all I was able to do it only for simple EA's (MA cross mostly) what made no difference actually. However Firebird is more complex EA and as we all know in trending market it opens trades in counter trend direction more likely than along the trend. My request to Actionpl is then to reverse the trade opening functions in one of firebird's versions (can be the most basic one from the beggining of the thread) so that instead of going long it went short and vice versa. The rest can remain the same.  
Sorry to bother You Actionpl. If this request would cost You too much time and effort then forget it but if not, I'd be grateful and of course promiss to post some outcome after I test it.  
best regards to everyone  
qba

HI Actionpl,  
  
Does the "Reduce_factor" features still work when it happen?  
on vs1_3a I set trend_watch and pop up alert to false everything seems to work ok.

Hi, the "Reduce_factor" will only work if the trend alarm was hit. So if the price action is too large between two pip, it will go through it whithout trigging it. That what happen to me. So that why i recommend to put an alarm larger than 40 for a 5 digits broker for now.  
  
What do you think of my proposal for vs1.4?? Is it worth the effort?

Hi Actionpl  
Sounds good.  
  
This EA is becoming more and more complex, but with a point by point guidance how to set the different values it shouldn't be a problem. It is good also that you and others have cleaned out some obsolete functions.  
  
I could also imagine some way for the EA to take positions WITH the trend when a currency cross is trending strongly - something that sort of 'kicks in' when an MA slope is steep, and disengages when the same MA flattens out... (since normally it takes positions during retracements, and in a strong trend the retracements are not big enough...)  
  
Wishful thinking? That's because I suck at programming!

I have ran through this thread and found the idea of manual driving the EA very interesting and in fact the most profitable of all I've tried so far. Anyway seeing Your work to make the EA fully automatic I started to think about EA's in totally different perspective. I might be totally wrong however I think it might be worth a try, not only with Firebird but with other EA's as well.

Hi qba, before changing code, you can do a paper exercise by having the EA place the trade and do manually the inverse trade and see what kind of result your are going to have over a three months period. You can use the simulator to do it. Go on View menue of Metatrader and selec "Strategy tester"  
  
I think it will be much more complex than changing the order the way you are thinking to do. Since you are going to go agains the trend most of the time.   
As everybody is saying "The trend is your friend" don't fight it...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I will start to think about how to do it.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
The first thing i will look at is to detect Tren_UP or Trend_Down. When the EA can detect it whithout degrading vs1.3a, i will release vs1.3b.  
  
It will take some time to write the code and debug since i'm quite busy righ now. An other benefice that i can think of is this new feature will protect us again gap openning. The EA will stop trading if the price open below for a up trend and above for a Down trend for any reason.

Hi Divyendu, i think this kind of automatisation is not sucessuful on a long run since market condition change and when we establish the algorithm to trade it is good only for the conditions that we have study. So i think as Samurai on this subject, it is much better to have tools that help our trading. The decision stay with us to decide if the MA or other indicator are steep enough to initiate a trade or wait.

Yes the market is changing overtime so when its not fit with the current market changing then we have to re-code the EA again to adjust with the current market (for me re-coding the EA is an imposible task), and that will happen every time the market changing, tweking and tweaking again and it will last forever. I dont think I want to do that, and neither for someone like actionpl who has coding skill is willing to do that.

So I came up combining the EA with trendline (thanks to actionpl) that for most of us is easy to draw and all of proffesional trader with consistent profit are using trendline, S&R line. We can adjust the current market condition with just only draw a new trendline according to the current market, and its only take 5 minute to do that without to re-code the Firebird engine again.  
This is how we can ride the trend while digging lots of green pips and automaticly jump off the car when the trend against us. It means minimizing drawdown, and we can have a bigger lot size to trade, it means larger profit, it means we can double our account easily.  
Hopefully u guys can catch the idea, it is not changing the system on my first post but to add a suplement on how we can drive it much easier without emotion intach and much controlable.

Samurai, great work it seems like a really good system, especially for people who are busy during the day.  
  
I wonder if it is possible for the system to 'recognise' a trendline that I have pre-drawn so that if that trendline is breached it will initiate an order?

How are you all doing? I don't post much anymore but this is still my #1 thread. I must admit, that I lost myself in all EA upgrading, but wish you all best to achive what will work for you best.   
Below is a template that I use and nothing more. And a signal that I would take (I did take). I close all trades within 24hours, usually before NY open, that way things can't get out of control. It depends what news is coming up, but usually I don't trade in major news (reds). I started to study candle patterns more intense, combining with S/R lines, current trend....I make desision! Divergence I don't trade - just not against it. PA is not so hard to understand, thats why good traders say TRADING CAN BE VERY EASY. Hell, mabey they are right![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1). much logic is in PA, and if trading that makes sence, then it should be profit on the long run. So far, this works for me, I manage to pull +1200pips live this month and that's not bad for conzervativ like me![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Here is a link for Forex Control Center program, very good manager program for your account. I think everyone should have it:

Much success...

I am certain this question has been raised before. I have been testing the Firebird EA’s on demo for several weeks now and they seem to produce a small steady profit but the one thing I notice almost without exception the a new position always goes considerably against the required direction, anything up to 80 pips, before returning to a profitable position. So my question is it possible to set this EA to open its positions in the opposite direction to the EA’s intended trade?

I, you are the second requesting this feature. You need to realize that you are going to trade agains the trend. This will produce good results when trend reverse but during a given trend it will be agains the trend and it has been demonstrated many time that is not the way to trade.   
What i suggest is to do what i have recommend to qba.  
  
"you can do a paper exercise by having the EA place the trade and do manually the inverse trade and see what kind of result your are going to have over a three months period. You can use the simulator to do it. Go on View menue of Metatrader and selec "Strategy tester""  
  
Try it and let us know, perhaps this FireBird EA will produce a profit. IF your experience is profitable, i can add a swith to inverse the trade that the EA will do normally. It is not very complex to do but before introducing this strategy in this forum and produce more confusion, we will need more data that demonstrate the validity of this concept and the support of Samurai.

Hi Actionpl,  
  
I believe this EA:Firebird-v63H04_Heiken_Ashi_Trend_vs1_3a is the latest that you all are using now.Do you have a manual on how to input the parameters of this EA, as i am quite new to using EA?

Look at the chart below, divided by column A, B and C  
  
On Column A  
It was a downtrend (Drive Short Only) and the trendline devide between the trade area and not trade area, when the price touch and break the trendline the EA will devide the SL on the opening position by the Reduce_factor variable and then the EA will stop untill we activate the EA again. See the circle No.1  
  
Its the same on column B and C depends on trend direction.

i believe when we use trendline we can reduce drawdown for a max -500pips when the price hit the trendline while we can gain pips up to 400pips per pair per day.

Hi SamuraiPower, i've completed the code and i'm testing it. In simulation it seem to work very good. It will be ready for next week trading scessions.  
What i will release is a 100% safe way to stop trading if the price go agains our trend, even if it gap above or below our trend at the openning or when a news come out. This will be vs1.3b, it will have the same feature that vs1.3a have. So even if people use vs 1.3b with the same setup as vs1.3a, it will react the same way than vs1.3a.   
For vs 1.4 it required still more programming. (Version 1.4 will allow us to initiate a trade when a trend line is broken and if we put inside the description "Trade_"

I haven't checked the code but how are you checking to see if the price crosses the trend line?  
  
If its just a vector its trivial to see if price crosses the vector.  
  
For 1.4 I thought this was already implemented? If you put "Trade_" in the description it will trigger trading until "Alarm_" trend line is crossed? Problem is sometimes you do not know when a trend is going to start and what it will look like so how would you know to draw a trendline a certain way?  
  
Thanks,  
Jag

Hi guys.  
  
I did some testing of EuroUsd, and this is what I came up with:  
The cross is a good deal more volatile than any time before the middle of 2008, and it is possible the earning potential of Firebird will be enhanced by a wider stop loss margin.   
  
On the picture you can see two envelopes: the blue one is related to Low, shift 1, deviation 4% (which represents 540 pips). The red one is related to High, with the same settings. As you can see this period since Dec 08 to the present day has only triggered this 540 pip SL five times. A SL of 300 pips would have been triggered many many more times, due to the volatility.  
  
Samuraj kindly explained his settings and mentioned he estimates 400 pips gain per day in an unbroken trend, and a 500 pip hit when the trend breaks, based on trendline automatic stop. For my earnings potential calculation I have used 300 pips gain per day and a 870 pip hit when trend reverses. I have used the simplest most automatic method of reversing the driving of Firebird (No need for complicated positioning of trend-lines). If during any day a SL is hit all trades are cancelled and the next day trades in the opposite direction are started. No thinking is required for this, just a mechanical application of this change over when a stop loss is hit (Can be done with the automated trend-line, by putting it where SL is likely to be hit).  
  
Starting with $2500, and compounding all the interest, it seems as if it is possible to reach $25000 in less than a year ( I have real data from Dec 2008, and have extrapolated future figures on these.)  
  
Please tell me my calculation is correct![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

I don't get it are you talking about the Eur Usd. The average true range of that pair has been about 170-200 pips that is for last month, where did you come up with 300 pips and you talking about an 870 pips stop loss. I do not get it , may be i am missing something here.  
  
I have been demo trading the original firebird on post 1 (not gotten into all the mods) using a 50 pip take profit and 100 pip sl on GU with great results and i discovered that the ea works best during a consolidation period . So pls i need more explanation on what you are talking about

Hi Okehiedon  
  
Congratulations on your good results on the GU. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Yes the ATR on the Eurodollar is as you say less than my numbers. Let me explain:  
  
These musings of mine are in the context of Samurajpower's and Actionpl's recent work with dynamic trendline recognition to help run the EA.  
  
Let's say that you are 'driving' firebird long; allowing it only to take long positions in a (Daily Chart) Uptrend.  
The highest position possible for the day is somewhere below the high price of the day (25 to 50 pips below? here is something for somebody to research).  
For the stop loss of that highest position to be triggered its TakeProfit must not be triggered, and the price must fall the entire length of its stop loss (300 is commonly used at the moment).  
  
I find 300pips SL will be triggered quite often due to large retracements of the EuroUsd - retracements that still do not change the overall trend.  
  
What I have described is not really an Average Range in the ordinary sense. I have described a space large enough to accommodate large retracements that did not constitute trend changes. To do this I have used two 'envelope' indicators.  
  
One envelope (timeframe![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)ay, period:1) based on the low of the day indicates how high the price can go before that lowest position is tripped and the other, based on the high of the day, is the same but reverse.  
  
Hope this clarifies my previous post ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)

Hi, In version 1_3b, a function read in the object description if there is an Alert set, it will trig when the price go below or upper the trend which you have trace. In Version 1_3a, it is a window around the trend line define by the number of pip identified by "Alert_30". In this case the window was 3 pips for a 5 digit broker. That is why it is not safe for large tic to tic variations.  
  
Features of Version 1.4 are not ready it will require more testing and debug to make it usable and userfriendly. The idea is to use what we are going to place in the trendline description to tell the EA to buy or sell.  
Ex. If you place the following description: "DownTrend_Trade_Alert_50" The EA will stop any further entry after crossing the trend line and will initiate a special trade (buy) after price goes above 5 pips from the trend line.  
This will should reduce our drawdown. Assuming that it is a real trend reversal. Obviously you will still need to drive your system in a semi-automatic mode and do manual adjustment if it was not a real reversal.

Hi SamuraiPower, here it is, our new version for the week.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
As described before, this version will work as version 1.3a but with an additionnal way to describ the trend line that make it 100% safe to gap in Price action.  
  
So, if you want to take advantage of this new feature, just fill the description trend line the following way otherwise keep the same method as before.  
Ex:  
"UpTrend_Alert_xx" or DownTrend_Alert_xx"   
  
P.S. When the description is done this way, version 3b will not take into account xx. It is only there in preparation for version 1.4.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
I will continue to work on version 1.4.  
  
Have a good trading week to all.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

So you are saying that with a 870 pips sl you will rarely get stopped out of the trend until you hit your 400 pips tp.

Hi Okehiedon  
The SL I backtested was around 540 pips. The 870 pips mentioned was the estimated loss at trend reversal, involving more than one position closed at a loss.   
  
With this SL of 540pips you would rarely get stopped out during the first four months of 2009, but when you did get stopped out it would cost you...(more than if you would have been using SL 300)  
  
TP would be the normal 50. The 400 you mention must be the number of pips gained on a normal good day as per the estimation of Samurajpower. I have turned down my estimation to 300 per day.

U are the man ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)!!  
  
Driving the ea, first day already closed 3 position for 100 pips and have a P/L of 192 pips with 5 opened position, all in profit!  
  
I'm sure we can work on the EA and integrate the code that shows the arrow so it would take the direction of the last arrow on Daily and trade only that direction.  
  
Thanks for the system, really apreciate, this way we can filter the false breakouts of the Firebird.

Another trade for 100 pips damn! 2 on Eur/USD for 100 pip, 1 for USD/CHF and 1 for GBP/USD, 4 opened trades now.  
  
Samuraipower, i'm sure we can work with this system on real, maybe integrate the arrow system with the ea and test it in demo too ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
**Update:** With 4 pairs, driving it manually, made 600 pips in 1 day. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Testing the last version on my VPS right now.

So, If I may ask you, Actionpl, does the HAS still perform any significant funtion in the EA, it looks like the trendline does all the trade decisions now?. I believe that its initial function was to stop trade after color changed, right?, is that function still applicable in v1.3a and up?.   
  
Ayo.

With the last version, the strategy from the first post (the semiautomatic way) is changed? If so, what are the settings for that strategy (i mean by watching daily).

I think i misunderstood, this is still not full automatic?  
  
If we have to set it long or short, what's are the indicators samurai power is using on page 83?

You still have to drive it long or short manually. But, I think it's mainly based on trendline, support and resistance now, if you look at the picture he attached to the post, but you may also use any other indicator to support your decisions for the trend direction, thats from my own understanding of the updated versions.

Perfect then ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1), I still like to check the D chart and set it, the backtesting wasn't bad for the ea but i think it still needs our hand to work.  
  
Maybe samurai power can tell what are the indicators on chart so I can follow the rules.

Hi SamuraiPower,  
Many thanks for this system. I've been demo your original Semi-Auto EA. Very nice, thank you.   
  
I have a quick question. When I manual close trades that have been initiated by the EA, does it stop initiating trades? I manually closed trades about 3 hrs ago and it has not initiated any new trades. Many thanks if you could answer this for me.

I see, so it will hedge the position in case of trend reversal.  
  
So idea is to hedge the position if it is 50pips(5 digit) or 5 pips (4 digit) above the trend line and there is no more window?   
  
What happens when the trend line is broken (special order is executed) and then price comes back under the trend line? It should not execute orders under normal conditions right? This would cause problems if it did since if trend line is crossed, chances are a new resistance has been set and it will cross the trend line again, which will cause you to lose money on the hedged (special order) position.

Hi guys.  
Thx for all your work![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
Just wondering, I am getting "to low divergence limit" in left top screen. What does that mean?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)  
Tried version a and b with default now, they both opened a trade against the trend?? Do I have to make a LT to make them work? How do I do that?  
  
thx again.

Hi there,  
  
is it possible to do the following:  
  
When attatch the EA to ie. a long trending pair (longs only), when the EA is initially attatched, can it be set so it takes a long trade immidetialy?  
  
So we start with a trade instantly?  
  
Thx

So idea is to hedge the position if it is 50pips(5 digit) or 5 pips (4 digit) above the trend line and there is no more window? **Yes, You will be able to select any window that you like.**  
  
What happens when the trend line is broken (special order is executed) **Yes** and then price comes back under the trend line? It should not execute orders under normal conditions right? **Right** This would cause problems if it did since if trend line is crossed, chances are a new resistance has been set and it will cross the trend line again, which will cause you to lose money on the hedged (special order) position. **Your righ again. That why it is a semi-automatic system. This process will give us more time to react and adjust to the new trend by closing trade or whatever you want. Overall it should reduce our drawdown.

Hi, it all depend of your selection. If you select true for Manage_Trade, it will do a trade only in the same direction than your Heiken Ashi indicator.  
  
I believe that its initial function was to stop trade after color changed, right? Yes and No, it will disable the trade only during time where price action is agains your setup. Ex. Manage_Trade=true, Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod=240 and index=1, it will prevent a trade if the previous bar is agains your position seting. If you drive long, it will take trade only during white bars.  
is that function still applicable in v1.3a and up?. **Yes**

With the last version, the strategy from the first post (the semiautomatic way) is changed? **NO** If so, what are the settings for that strategy (i mean by watching daily), **In version 1.3b, the default are the setting that SamuaiPower recommend in his post on page 83.**

I can answer for SamuraiPower..

I am getting "to low divergence limit" in left top screen. What does that mean? **It mean that your variable "DivergenceLimit"is too low for the pair that you are looking at and for the existing price action. You can increase this value to a higher value if you want to trade more agressively.

thx for ansver  
I have read the first page, there you haveto check the trend and set it only long or only short.  
But on the new version, shall I set it on long&short?  
does it figure out the trend by it self, without any help from me?

Thanks ActionPl, 1000 pips the first day with 4 pairs, I'll stick to this system. I think we only need a good margin even to trade just one pair because it could open more trades in the same direction (As happened in demo) and some practice in understanding the daily chart, then we can make a living from forex.

Hi Gabriel  
Sorry for all my questions..  
But what version are you using? are you setting up a TL that the EA is using?

Hi again,  
  
thank's for your reply.  
  
I searched the thread, but couldn't find answer to this one:  
  
Can I disable the DV limit function? Even I have set "Use V63 Divergence" to "false" I dont get any trades due to low Divergence.  
  
I would like to disable the divergence, can I do that? II also tried to set it to 500, but still no trades (GJ).  
  
Thank's in advance,  
  
PC

Hi everyone,  
  
Well done on the work carried out till now by all contributors. I have been following this thread from early days, and lately I have been running a small live micro account on it as well. Very impressive strategy. Wish to confirm what other writers in this thread have stated over and over.......use discipline and have trust in your stop losses, keep emotion out of it.  
  
A small feature which will assist in manual drive trading, is to display in the top corner of the screen, whether the EA has been set to Long, Short or Both. With staring at the screen, one starts doubting your settings for a currency and this results in repeated re-checks of the EA to check whether it was set correctly to long or short! Can this be amended?  
  
Keep up the great work...........  
  
Andy

Here's my statement, driving the ea only one day. The losses were only because I didn't understood that I had to set the Firebird (at last version) to place only Buy or Sell. Without the losses i think there are 1000 pips.

Look at the first chart below, divided by column A, B and C.  
This is an explanation pic of general idea of Firebird EA with trendline combined.  
On Column A  
It was a downtrend (Drive Short Only) and the trendline devide between the trade area and not trade area, when the price touch and break the trendline the EA will devide the SL on the opening position by the Reduce_factor variable and then the EA will stop untill we activate the EA again. See the circle No.1  
Its the same on column B and C depends on trend direction.  
  
Look at the second chart.  
That is a sample of trade I take untill now, on 29 April the arrow and and HA is in line showing an uptrend move (see the first white circle), and the previous candle shows pressure on downtrend to go up so I took "Long Only" mode, currently I gained +1300pips and keep moving. I lock the profit with trendline becouse when the price go down and touch the trendline then the EA will close opening position, if I put the trendline correctly then I will loss for only -300pips (see the 2nd white circle I draw), and I still got at least +1000pips in my bank right now. If the price keep moving up then I will keep gaining green pips, but if it goes down i will only loss arround -300pips (not much I guess). I only adjust the trendkine once a day, I dont trade news, I can still do other thing and have fun enjoying my life (mhmm ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)..I guess trading is so easy...). Unlike a fully automatic EA, doing this way the control is in our hand 100%, Keep pipin' guys.....![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi Samuray.  
  
You posted a link on how to set trendline: So, if you want to take advantage of this new feature, just fill the description trend line the following way otherwise keep the same method as before.  
Ex:  
"UpTrend_Alert_xx" or DownTrend_Alert_xx"  
  
All I can manage in my metatrader are to draw a line... where and how do you write in the alerts up and down? And how to put so that the EA responding to it? I thought you had to check "Trendline_Watch:" true for it to work...

Hi GasGas  
I found your indicator very interesting and so far have found a good many pips on my demo a/c

You can always create 2 templates for this, one for LONG only and the other for SHORT only. That's what I did, Short only template has purple background and Long only has aqua background, that way i don't have to re-check EA all the time. i hope this helps a little bit.  
  
Ayo.

Hi  
  
Interesting EA and a fantastic work! By default Reduce_factor: 2.0 but in Samurajs instruction he wrote 20. Do you use 20 or did you forget the . ?

if u set to 2 then the sl will devide by 2, so if u put 300sl it would be 150, just like actionpl said if u want to make the ea close all opening posision set reduce factor to a bigger number such as 20 or higher

EA seems to work perfect. Have it on 10 pairs with Samurais settings. I have write a trendline in every chart. If trendline is hit...am I protected and the EA stop trade + close all trades?  
Or do I have to write something somewere on the trendline?

Thanks Samurai Power, all credits go to you as i just followed what you provided.  
  
I think the key is to understand the price movement on the Daily chart, I'm starting to consider more currencies together to understand the general trend for the Euro for example. I also watch weekly and monthly charts to get a better idea. I think the EA has not to be set every day, it depends but i think that if we're not very close at a resistance on the daily chart we can keep it on Long or Short for 2-3 or more days.  
  
I mean, if Eur/USD is buy on daily, Eur/CHF too and USD/GBP is sell, and eventually EUR/GBP is buy this mean.  
  
**SO:** We have a strong Euro that is stronger than USD, CHF and the Pound, but if the Pound is stronger than USD this obviously, the Eur is stronger than the USD too (as it is stronger than the GBP).  
  
It's called currency crossover if i'm right.

Hey Koyco  
  
I guess you mean Channel, yes these two green lines usually represent strong resistance/support lines. I love that indicator. In the bottom, is stochastic indicator for overbought/oversold area +divergence lines. If you not familiar with divergence, I suggest to read some info about that. I would not suggest trading against divergence, its almost like trading against trend (in my opinion). See pic below to get an idea...Very cool stuff for confirmation

Ok, thanks gasgas for the **Stochastic Divergence** indicator. I'm using this, plus another one for crosses that catches major trends.  
  
So basically it's samurai power's chart, plus the **QQE indicator** I use and the Stochastic Divergence.  
  
I made a zip file, with the **chart template.tpl** and **all the indicators** you need to make it easier for everyone. Attached an image too that explains.  
  
I'll sum up the rules for my chart:  
**1)** Watch for an **arrow** on the chart.**  
2)** Check the **Stochastic Divergence** indicator for the cross.  
**3)** The **QQE indicator** direction has to confirm the trend. A cross of the red dotted line or a 50 line cross. The QQE will not confirm smaller crosses as the Stochastic Divergence does, however the _**system will get the needed pips even with smaller crosses**_ if **we enter immediately** after the arrow/stochastic cross without waiting for 1 candle to close..  
  
As you can see the **_Stochastic Divergence indicator catches more swing trades_** (check the picture), while the _**QQE is a strong trend indicator**_ that can help you draw trend lines and get the direction on long term, 1 week or more.

Hi, you need to set your EA the following way.  
  
Set your variable "DivergenceLimit" at a large number it is set to 0.002 by default.  
Set variable Use_"V63D_Divergence" at false.

Read back post 1110 for a complete description.  
Here the section in ref. to trendline description  
"To set this trendline description you need to double clic on the trendline, then right clic while having your cursor on the trend line, you will see a popup window with trendline properties, clic on trendline properties, you will have the popup window with the description field blank. Double clic on the description field and enter your alert as described above."

Just wondering, what pair are you guys in a trend with now? I set downtrend on usd-jpy, eur-usd, eurjpy. Made about 250 pips so far, but not to good now![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) Suddenly they all turned against me, maybe I was to fast determing a change of trend....

Hi Gabriel  
  
Thank you for the TL I am trying it out to see how it goes though it looks very straightforward.  
What TF do you find works best and where do you place your ST & TP also as a matter of interest, which is you favourite style of trading?

No matter how much I try I can´t get this to work. When I drag the EA to my chart it just doesn´t show up like nothing happens, the same as when I drag the indicators , they don´t show up on my charts, very strange, as everything else is working well... hmmm

The system you're seeing has to be used with the Firebird EA (you find the details in the first post) provided by Samurai Power.   
  
The chart I'm using, is on Daily and has to be used to decide the trend Buy or Sell and set the EA to trade only in one direction.

I trade EUR/USD, USD/CHF, GBP/USD and EUR/CHF.  
  
Right now only trading on EUR/USD and USD/CHF as we have buy cross on USD/CHF at the stochastic divergence and sell at EUR/USD wich make sense as Dollar is appreciating while euro depreciating.  
  
The other two pairs have the EAs disabled right now, waiting for a new arrow and cross.  
  
2 trades opened on €/$ and 2 on $/CHF. I'm quite sure this 4 trades will have 100 pips each. 1 Trade closed today with the trailing stop at 40 pips, i've disabled the trailing stop right now on all the 4 pairs.  
  
I think tomorrow all the 4 positions will be closed.

It's TrailingStop, nothing to do with Pipstep, I just use the default settings.

I'm not using pipstep, i've set it to 0 right now because it''s risky on a live account, you could get margin call. I want one trade per time, we'll see how it goes.

You need to divide by 10 those variables.

If you set variable TrendLineWatch to true, the system will not trade up to a point where the price action hit a trend with an Alert set to it. So if the pair does not trend, you can set two trend on up and one down with Alert to it. When one of those will be hit the system will start to trade the way you have selected. This is a nice feature to setup your chart and you don't have to look at it every hour or so.  
  
So if you don't want to wait for a trend to be broken before it start to trade leave this variable to false.

Make sure you have the Heiken Ashi indicator in your custom indicator folder.  
  
If it still does not work, look at the expert folder on metatrader and look at error message, it will give you an indication what is missing in your setup.

If you set manage trade to true, the EA will look at variable "index" and if it is set at 1, it will trade or not according to the previous bar setup to the timeframe that you have selected on Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod. So to monitor what happen, you need to set your chart to the same time frame that you have set in your setup. And look at the Heiken Ashi indicator.   
  
P.S. if you set index to 0, it will look at the current bar, so if the bar change color during the 240min, you can have a trade if it is in line with the trade direction that you want.

Start with EURUSD and GDPUSD, all the JPY pair have a more volatile way of trading and you need to adjust the divergenceLimit to a higher level if you use it and need to be monitor closely

Hi Elovv,  
  
I think it is much better if u just have 1 pair or maximum 2 pair to trade with the EA but with larger lot size, minimizing energy, the FB setting is doing great for EU and GU, let say U trade 10 pair with 1lot each, why dont just use 10lot with 1 pair, that way u can focus on predicting the major trend direction, less analyzing time, less stress, not much news (if u are fundamentalist).  
About trendline thing, i guess u got the answer already....  
keep pipin'.....

Hi All,  
  
GU overall is still in an up move, +100pips today untill now and protected with trendline and keep moving up (I hope...).  
  
EU I see that pressure on bear is higher, still stick with buy since 2 days ago, but if its go down my trendline protect me at 1.3240. If its happen i might lose arround 180pips after gain hundreeds of pips before.

Thanks.  
The QQE indicator as you can see in the [image posted here](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2715174&postcount=1291) has **2 lines** , you **set the Firebird EA to only BUY** if you have a **cross of the red dotted line** by the yellow one and the cross **points up** (**SELL** if it points down), a cross of the **50 line** on the QQE indicator it's a **major move**.   
  
QQE is **very powerful on H4 chart too** and on H1 you must check for 50 line crosses. However i'm using QQE just to _better understand the price direction and set the EA to trade_ on that direction.  
  
**To set the EA BUY or SELL, use the Stochastic Divergence (up and down crosses) and watch the QQE to understand the direction on long term.**

What do you think about the new NFA hedging rules, which comes into effect on May 15? IBFX have issued a notice that after May 8 they will not allow hedging on open orders within a currency pair.

You mean TrendLine_watch set to yes? I've set that too but i get "Trades disabled - Waiting for trendline activation".  
  
In [this post](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2714301&postcount=1280) you've set it to false. Would you mind posting a .set file?

Hi! all. My biggest problem is not the point of entry, it is when to get out of the trade without giving back what i had.  
  
Heiken Ashi is for me a nice tool that help me to trail my Stops and maximize my profits without or less fear and greed (give the price a chance to get there).   
In fact its kind of a dynamic SL: It will move the SL 1 or 2 pips on a HACandle and the next bar, the SL could move 6 to 7 pip or more. Its better then a static 20 pips trailing stop that you are sure to lose 20 pips at the end.  
  
Here are some setting for externs variables (subjective).  
  
Hardstop = (40) pip // Initial SL when the trade is open   
  
MoveToBE = (20) pip // Will move the SL to BE if the trade have reach (x) pip but is still in opposite color   
  
TakeProfit1 = (40) pip // Take first profit at (x) pip   
TakeProfit2 = (60) pip // Take second profit at (x) pip   
TakeProfit3 = (80) pip // Take Third profit at (x) pip   
TakeProfit4 = break of the trailing step HA (close all remaining)  
  
PercentClose1 = (25) % // Close (x) % of the trade after first TakeProfit1 is reach  
  
PercentClose2 = (25) % // Close (x) % of the trade after second TakeProfit2 is reach  
  
PercentClose3 = (25) % // Close (x) % of the trade after third TakeProfit3 is reach  
  
TrailspikeCond = True // Will allow TrailSpike  
TrailSpike = (10) pip // will trail from the current candle: if price went (x) pip of current HACandle... (close all)  
  
TrailspikePip = (5) pip // Will trail (x) pip from the current candle (ex: trail by 5 pips STEP)   
In a SELL: When the EA find a range of 10 pips between the current low of the HACandle et the actual price   
it will start the trail of 5 pips.  
  
CloseAll = true // if true, will Close All position at the condition (HACandle open opposite color)  
not if the HardStop is still on  
  
HACandleTimeFrame = (15)M // Will Look at HACandle the (x) timeFrame only.  
  
TrailFromXPrevCandle = (1) candle // Will trail from (x) HACandle (default = 1) (will look at the previous HACandle)  
  
PutStopXPipFromHA = (2) pip // Will trail from (x) pip of the TrailFromXPrevCandle (default = 2)  
  
  
(scenario)  
A trade is open: SELL  
1\. The trade is place on Green HACandle, so the HardStop is place at 20 pips.  
2\. Then the price move 12 pips in our favor, but the HACandle is still Green. The SL is then put to BE.   
3\. In the same HACandle the price cross our first TakeProfit1(20pips), so it close 25% of the position.  
4\. Three Candle later the HACandle close Red, So the SL is move at the high + PutStopXPipFromHA(2 pips).  
5\. In the same candle the price reach our TakeProfit2. So it close 25% of the trade.  
6\. The next Candle, the SL is move again at the previous high + PutStopXPipFromHA(2 pips).  
In the same Candle the price reach the TakeProfit3... So it close 25% of the trade.  
7\. We are lucky the price still go in our favor and we reach a little spike(yellow bar). So the Trailing Stop(5pips) is on  
20 pips later it Close All remaining position. in this case is the last 25% of the position. ( the chart was edited for the purpuse of the scenario)  
  
PS: I know that the HACandle are always in motion.. But when the EA find a 10 pips between the current HACandle and the actual price...  
It Trigger the Trailing Stop.

Gbp/Jpy might end up with shooting star today. Great rejection from Resistence line. Trend reverse? I just might go short on that.

That sounds like the best use of the trendlines. Even is no new trades are opened, there is still the possibility of the open trades going against you.  
With the kill all open orders trendline, we could truly forget about waking up to a big surprise loss...

Hi to all, with version 1.4, this fonctionnality will be included.  
By the way, you can have as many trend line with alert as you want. The EA will toogle between able to trade and unable to trade each time it hit a trend line with an "Alert_" attach to it. So be careful with what you are doing.  
  
It should work this way.  
If you put the following description in your trend line: DownTrend_Close_Alert_  
As soon the price action will go above the trend line, it will close all sell open trade if it is a DownTrend. If you put as description UpTrend_Close_Alert_ all buy open trade will be close.  
  
This will version will also included the trade hedging fonction as described in previous post.   
If the description is: DownTrend_Trade_Alert_20 it will initiate a buy trade when the price action will be 20 pips above your trend line. As soon the price action will go above your trend line, it reduce the stoplost by the factor that you have given in the "Reduce_factor" variable. Same fontionnality for the UpTrend but with a sell trade.  
  
I hope i don't confuse people with all those features.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) For those of you who take time to understand it, it allow you to plan the execution of your strategy whithout being in front of your screen waiting for something to happen.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
Bye  
  
P.S. I will release vs 1.4 for Sunday openning. I still have some test to do in simulation. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/270c-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

I have trades opened for -1000 pips, I'm think I'll trade only on QQE crossover, I opened thos trade using the arrow and stochastic divergence, going against the QQE.  
  
I think it's more safe with QQE, so trading only when QQE, Stochastic Divergence, Candle Color + Arrow point in the same direction. Maybe less (not sure) but safe pips, you can trade more pairs if you feel you're getting not enough pips (remember that 400 pips a month, but safe can be 400$, 4000$ or 40.000$, depends on your leverage and margin).

Inspired by TheGabriel's template I have drawn together this setup. EURUSD being fairly volatile these days I have gone for a 400 SL to better catch the swings. Could be shorter on other pairs - or longer, as in the case of GBPUSD. Anyhow, the Trend Line Alert should take care of anything that runs away in the wrong direction. The strongest factor for me to decide if, and which direction to trade, is the trend lines. One day has resulted in 3x50 pips on this pair. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

I suggest you use the 4 hr charts for trendlines, they are better placed there and the daily charts for major support and resistances horizontal lines.

Hi everyone!  
First I want to thanks to Samurai for sharing this great EA, and to everyone here who is working on this EA to make it better.   
  
I have been testing the Firebird for a month on a demo account. i decided to make a try and use it on areal account, now that I have more confidence and understood how to drive it ,I tried to use it on a real account. I don't know why but it doest open any trades.   
The smiley is ON I checked my settings and everything is looking good, as i change back and login to the demo it works fine.  
  
Can someone help me please to understand why it doesn't work on a real account?  
  
Thanks  
Sorry for my English is not my native language

Hi Smurai,  
Your EA sounds exciting. I do not trade robots they frighten me as one is no longer in control, I like to be in control of my own destiny. Having said that, I have just blown my account using Forex Ambush. As I write it is still 120 pips from profit target. There are many Sheisters selling rubbish.  
  
Back to your EA.   
I would like to use it where can I down load it please.

You should not be freightened if you use Stop Loss and Take Profit, not very tight (depends on your margin) and follow timeframes like H4, Daily, Weekly.  
  
Being frightened is a psicological problem with or without EA, you have to solve this.

You have missed the boat my friend. Robots are mechanical things that can not change as the market does from minute to minute. That is why I like the Samurai idea. It leaves me in charge of my own destiny. I do not like my financial future controlled by uncontollable entities. I have no fear in me when it comes to trading. Having said that, could you please provide me with the download link of the Samurai semi mechanical system?  
Thank you for the interest and your reply.   
I hope and pray that you make big money and spend it wisely.   
Good luck trading the forex Market.

Hey Samurai and everyone else, sorry I have been away for so long and not contributing. Just finished up final exams, and finished moving across country so out of the game for a while. Looks like I have alot to catch up on, and looks as though you have further optimized the Ea, nice!  
  
Hopefully I can bring myself up to speed in the upcoming weeks.

There are a lot of choices like [forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile") or alpari.com or [fxcm](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile").com etc. but I suggest using a broker based in U.K. as in USA new law is coming into force from 15th. inst. which will prevent hedging.

If you phone MB directly they will set up a demo account for you. However, the MT4 has been in beta for months, and there is no sign it will be released anytime soon, I wouldn't hold your breath. Apparently I am told it is a programming nightmare to adapt MT4 with ECN. I stopped using the demo for that reason, very glitchy and offline half the time.

My thinking with using the daily chart for trendlines is that I want to see the price move within the entire width of the uptrend or downtrend channel. If the price wanders outside the channel the EA plays safe and immediately switches off. With a shorter timeframe like 4H smaller scale channels may come into focus, as well as the big one which I aim to follow.  
  
Success

This trendline is doing awesome, I have no emotion involved again and its really helps me a lot on taking my desicion easier, risking only -180pips and now Im finally gain for about +1.000pips for total +2.257pips in 9days trading for EU and GU. Thx to actionpl for making this happens.

Hi Samurai!  
In Your post 1280, your sample TL is drawn on a 1D chart. How do you decide where to place the TL on the 5m chart? -   
1) do you draw on the 1D, then reduce scale to 5M? or  
2) do you look at the trend on the 5M for the past say 4-6 hours plus allow for say a 30 pip buffer to allow for small retracements? Or,   
3) any other method?   
  
Regards  
  
Andy

nice question, the answer is arround past several pages, but i guess lots of people dont know this yet. if u see the ea properties u can find chart_timeframe variable, i fill it with 5 to make the ea run in 5M chart no matter which timeframe u are working the ea will work in 5M chart, n i do draw TL on daily chart

Thanks.  
Sorry for getting mixed-up here. With the above settings, does this mean there is only one TL, and this is on the Daily Chart even though the EA is connected to the 5M chart? Or do you have an extra TL on the 5M chart?

Hi, i have completed my test on this version for those two new features.  
A trend line with the following word "Close_" will act as described in my previous post(just clic on the blue arrow at the beginning of this post to get the details). And a trend line with "Trade_" in it will intiate a hedge trade when the trend line is hit.  
  
Note: If the Trendline with a Close in it is hit, the EA will stop trading waiting for your intervention. Any other trendline that is hit will toogle the EA state between able to trade and unable to trade.  
  
This should provide us with more free time and still monitor the market efficiently. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi Andy, when you place a trend line, you can use any timeperiod that you want to draw it, it will show on all time period.   
2- You can have many trend line active at the same time. Just make sure that you know what you are doing. Start with one as Samurai describ in his post and make sure you understand well how it work. With version 1.4, you can have 5 types of trend that will react differently. Make sure you understand the subtility. I will recommend to start with the Simple "Alert_40" in your trend line description. This is the simplest one, the only thing it does is to stop trading when it is hit. When you use it, use 40 as minimum on a 5 digit broker.

Hi The Gabriel  
I don't trade live yet, but will start up with microlots soon. It is obviously a whole different ballgame with real money, as greed and fear comes into the picture. I will however start with 'small' balls in the form of microlots. My capital is very small anyhow, so it's got to be small - as small as possible.

Hope I will, i think I'll trade this way using the setup i posted:  
  
Watch the QQE, if the last cross was sell, trade only SELL on Stochastic Divergence (so any cross at 80-90 level) and Arrow. The same for buy (stochastic cross at 15-20 and last QQE cross buy)  
  
Thank you friend, wish good luck to you too.

Hi all  
  
I have only traded this EA one week with 10 pairs (max spread=5). I trade only the pairs wich have a clear trend. Put stop (trenline with alert) with yesterdays high/low. Fantastic result this first week.  
I will test it on IBFX demo 2 more weeks, if result is good I will test it live, first with very small money. On IBFX its possible to trade with 1penny/pip.

Ver 1.3b and with Samurais settings from post 1280. But I think you can use the latest version with the stop trade function. I will not do a knew trade if I get stopped. I wait until I can see a trend on the daily chart.

Thanks Action, great work!   
  
I am just a little confused on how the Downtrend_Close_Alert works in conjunction with the Reduce Factor setting?  
  
Say I have a downtrend, draw my trendline and in the description type Downtrend_Close_Alert_10 and say I have my Reduce_factor set to 2.  
  
What is the effect of this? Will it close my order when it is within 10 pips of my trendline or just cut my stoploss in half?  
  
Say I just want the order to close, do I need to set the Reduce_Factor to a high amount (say 10) or will the Downtrend_Close_Alert_10 function do this on its own?  
  
I was also wondering if I am understanding the Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod setting correctly? If you have Manage_Trade set to "true" and Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod set to 1440 (daily) when the daily HA changes colour I am assuming it just turns off the EA not allowing any more trades?  
  
  
Thanks again  
Serge

I know a demo account is available to anyone, but not real. They need proof for real account. Yea Mt4 with ECN over Currenex or whatever interbank they are using means there is an extra layer of complexity. You know, with this EA you should not even have to worry about brokers, but just a good one that does not requote and isn't a market maker because in the long run if you do make nice profits they will probably start screwing you over. You don't have to worry about hedging since this strategy does not involve selling and buying at the same time except for the 1.4 proposed strategy that makes takes an opposite position if trend line is broken over X pips. We still have to test for that to see if its even a feasible option over the long run.  
  
Anyone? A live account with small minimum deposit and no dealing desk?

A "close" in the trendline will stop the EA from any **new positions in the same direction** and reduce the **stoploss** by the reduction factor.  
  
Manage trades will use the HA to do automated trading in both directions. If HA is long it will set EA to long and vice versa. Keep Manage_trades to false if you want to use the EA with the trendlines we are discussing.

Thanks Jag. So if I am understanding this correctly all the Manage trades function does is control the "long only" or "short only" depending on the color of the HA candle on the daily (if set to 1440)?  
  
If this is correct this function doesn't make alot of sense to me. Wouldn't this replace the whole "driving" human interaction element, and also would be dangerous to use because could initiate trades in the wrong direction when a new daily HA candle forms and goes in the wrong direction for a few hours?  
  
It would be great if the Manage Trade functioned to simply deactivate the EA when the HA candle changes colour to that opposite the direction you are driving it. For example in an uptrend, driving the EA "long only" if the daily HA changes from Green to Red the EA will turn off, if it turns green again the EA will turn back on.  
  
I dont know if this is possible as I am not a programmer. Also I suppose we can use the regular Alert trendline to deactivate the EA as ActionPl has already explained.  
  
But anyhow the work by ActionPl and anyone else who contributed so far is a big improvement on the original Firebird, thanks again for your hard work and sharing with the rest of us!

For Testing purposes, do I have to wait for the EA to create a position to check if the Trendline exit works?  
  
Or, can I open a position manually then place the trendline to see if it closes the open position?  
I tried this but it did not work, so I don't know if I am doing something wrong.....

Hi Serge,  
here my answer in blue  
Say I have a downtrend, draw my trendline and in the description type Downtrend_Close_Alert_10 and say I have my Reduce_factor set to 2.  
  
What is the effect of this? Will it close my order when it is within 10 pips of my trendline or just cut my stoploss in half?  
With this setup, the EA will close all your trade (sell) and stop the EA to take any new trade when the price will go above the trendline. It does not take into account variable Reduce_factor when you have "Close_" in your description. It does not take into account the number you put at the end also.   
If you want to work with the "Reduce_factor" and have the EA manage the close, write your description this way. "DownTrend_Alert_10". This way, when the price go above the Trend, it will change your Stop loss by reducing it by a factor of 2 if the variable "Reduce_factor" is at 2 and stop the EA to take new trade waiting for your decision.   
P.S. Again, the number at the end of "Alert_xx" is not used. The number at the end of the "Alert_" is take into account if you have only "Alert_xx" in your description or if you have "Trade_" in your description in conjonction with "DownTrend_" or "UpTrend_".  
  
I was also wondering if I am understanding the Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod setting correctly? If you have Manage_Trade set to "true" and Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod set to 1440 (daily) when the daily HA changes colour I am assuming it just turns off the EA not allowing any more trades?  
If you have Manage_Trade at true, it will allow trade only in the direction of the previous daily bar if variable "index" is at 1 or the current bar if the "index" is at 0. Be careful about index being at 0, since the current bar can switch color many time during a given day. You can used this feature with any of the other features of the EA.

No, you can not open a trade manually for testing since the EA will not recognize your trade.  
The way to do it is to force the trade to open by using the trendline with "Trade_" in the description.  
let say you want to open a buy, do the fowllowing. (Will work only with version 1.4)  
1-Trace a trend line below the price action  
2- Give it the following description, "DownTrend_Trade_Alert_01"  
3- As soon you will clic ok and a new tic come in, it should open a buy  
  
then you can change the description of your trend line to test whatever you want.  
  
You can also used the simulator to test it. Do CTRL-R on your metatrader and follow the instruction.

Start with one as Samurai describ in his post and make sure you understand well how it work. With version 1.4, you can have 5 types of trend that will react differently.

Monday..monday...monday..I still dont like monday, sudenly reverse on daily chart often time (GU Pair), before I have this trendline thing I always too much worry, but now its not anymore, -90pips right now keep open and protected with trendline in around -150pips. On monday I usualy have no capability on predicting where the trend goes, well that just me I guess, but let the trendline taking care of my trade, no emotion intach. Thinking of turning off the EA for a while untill I see a clear major trend direction, let's see.....Still 2.257pips in the bank.

Yep, my Gbp/Usd almost hit my trendline and stopped out, but seems to be on a bit of an upward recovery now. Let's hope it continues!

Actionpl and Samuria, you guys are great. I personally want to say THANK YOU for this ingenius system, and Actionpl, you are the BEST. Anyway, Actionpl, Let me ask you a quick question as per V1.4 because I'm going to test it later, For now,I'm still winning with the V1.3a (you know what they say... you don't change a winning team).   
From your statement .. **a trend line with "Trade_" in it will intiate a hedge trade when the trend line is hit**....What is this function actually going to do? is it going to open a trade in the opposite direction while the other trade is on or it will close initial trade and open another in the opposite?. I'm asking this because there are some rules against Hedging now, at least in the U.S, I don't know if you put that in consideration.  
  
TIA.  
Ayo.

Nice work, Actionpl,   
i have just one question, its possible to drive ea with trendlines and completely without switch Only Long/Only short? What i mean, thats what we need is to program small check: if price above UpTrend_Trade_Alert_ then only buy allowed and vice-versa.

Hi Canni, what you are asking is the functionnality of version 1.5. I've completed the code and it seem to work pretty good in simulation. I'm testing it forward this week. I still have some cleanut to do and verify the effect on trading with manage_trade = true while having TradeAnalysis at true. Still investigating.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Basicaly, the version 1.5 will have all the features of the previous version but the trend line that you draw will decide which way you are trading. Exactly as Samurai describe it initially but without requiring anything other than the trendline.   
  
I will described when i release this version the detail of how to control your EA using the trendline.  
  
Make sure you understand version 1.4 well while waiting for this new improvement. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi ayoneeyee,  
  
What is this function actually going to do? is it going to open a trade in the opposite direction while the other trade is on **Yes, that the intend if you put in your trendline "Trade_"** or it will close initial trade and open another in the opposite? **Yes it can do that as well if you put in your description "Close_Trade_" Ex. DownTrend_Close_Trade_Alert_50  
this description will make the EA to close all sell trades as soon it goes above the trendline and it will take a buy if the price goes at 5 pip above it (5 digits broker).  
  
It is quite flexible as it is now. With version 1.5 it will be even easier since we will only pay attention to how we draw the trend and what we want to do when price hit the trend.

Hello man,  
  
True mate,Mondays are sometimes hard to trade, but I started to trade them,especially if I get reverse signal. Good thing is,usually on Mondays,there is almost no news,and price can go many pips. I went short G/Y,see pics. Fractal gave me reverse signal, channel resistance hasnt been broken, and price went over 300pips,almost exactly to support (red).   
If no US news,G/u and G/Y likes to move very similar, that I always consider.  
Im glad that you bank many pips my friend![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hi gasgas and serg,  
  
GU Yesterday daily candle droped and I was keep open in buy position but protected with trendline, the fun thing is that after I protected with trendline in around -150pips all I have to do is just check my acc afterwork, it might be loss for around -150pips or gain for another hundreeds of pips, but guess what, today I banked +100pips, +230pips on the go heading towards +300pips for total +400pips today. No emotion intach and I have a normal life rather than sitting in front of computer in along time. Keep pipin' ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Hey guys it looks like you have a very nice EA system. To be honest I think you guys hit the mint with it being driven based. I want to help out a little. Here is an indicator I use to see trends and trend bands. A very nice indicator here. Look at the pic and you will know what I am talking about. If the trend is up the lines are up, if it is sideways they are sideways and same for a downtrend. It can go on any time frame  
  
FWIW the lines are kinda hard to see in the pic but when you load the file they show up easily

Hi  
The verbatim quote by IBFX is:  
"If you are in a buy you cannot put in a sell pending order or sell market order in the same pair and the opposite is true with a sell.   
IBFX"

Hi ActionPl, sorry to be bombarding you with so many questions. The EA is not quite working the way I understood. When I have a trendline described as "Downtrend_Close_Alert_" what is happening is that when the line is breached any existing short trade has its stop loss value reduced by the Reduce_Factor (ie. Reduce_Factor = 2)   
No trades are closed and the EA is not deactivated but continues to open new short positions above the trendline.  
  
I guess I had misunderstood the previous explanations. I thought that this setup would turn the EA off, and close any existing Short trades. To accomplish this should I have the trenline described as "Downtrend_Close" instead?  
  
I also noticed then when my "Downtrend_Close_Alert_" line is breached is removes the Alert_ part within the description. Is this normal?  
  
Thanks again  
Serge

Hedging is.. you can't have both buy and sell trade going on at the same time on the same currency pair.

Nice to see people are doing pips here, I had another 5 positions for a total +500 today.   
  
I'm planning to trade live if it goes well with very very few losses when I ahve some experience, but there's a problem for me:  
  
I know the pipstep function does open another position if trade goes against us for X pips, I want this function disabled and even if I put 0 for Pipstep it's the same.

Hi SamuraiPower, I want to first of all THANK YOU for putting this thread together. I was really struggling to be profitable with forex and after trying all kinds of "Magic Boxes and Systems" I was nearly ready to give up.  
  
Then I came upon this thread and it really caught my attention. I spent the last week reading every post from start to finish! I just want to say this is fantastic! It really "makes sense" to me and I think it is exactly what I was looking for. Sometimes the simple things really are better, and this is one great example of that. Price action is the name of the game and will always beat out any other kind of fancy indicator.....  
  
Thanks again.  
  
I want to contribute to this thread so I am putting together a recap of all the EA settings and functions that I will post soon. ....

I am trying to put together a master sheet that describes all the EA settings and Functions. I have many of them completed, but some I do not understand. Can anyone who knows the definition of these please fill them in below and I will put it all together and post it here.. Thanks  
  
**EA SETTINGS:**  
**TrendAnalysis:** I think this is the master switch to enable the trendlines…????????????????  
****  
**TrendLineWatch: **If you set variable TrendLineWatch to true, the system will not trade up to a point where the price action hit a trend with an Alert set to it. So if the pair does not trend, you can set two trend on up and one down with Alert to it. When one of those will be hit the system will start to trade the way you have selected. This is a nice feature to setup your chart and you don't have to look at it every hour or so.  
So if you don't want to wait for a trend to be broken before it start to trade leave this variable to false.  
**ChangeOrder:** ???  
**Reduce_Factor:** Used when Trend_Watch is set to False. If set at 0, the stoploss will not be changed. If set any number other than 0, the stoploss will be reduced by this factor.   
Example: If in a downtrend and price rises to the DownTrend_Alert_ trendline, the stopploss value will be changed to ( current stoploss / Reduce_Factor). So if your current stoploss is 100, and your Reduce_Factor is 2, if the trendline is hit it will be changed to 50 (100/2).  
****  
**Manage_Trade** : if set at TRUE: it will only allow trade in the Heiken Ashi direction.  
  
**Heiken Ahsi Timeperiod** : variable sets the timeperiod used for the Heiken Ashi direction. (1440=Daily, 240=H4, 60=H1…)  
  
**Index:** If variable "**index"** is at 1 it looks at previous bar, or the current bar if the "**index** " is at 0. Be careful about index being at 0, since the current bar can switch color many times during a given day. You can use this feature with any of the other features of the EA.  
  
**Chart_Time_Frame:** TimeFrame for default indicators  
**MA_length:** Firebird calculates a Simple Moving Average of this length ( 10 default), and then shifts it up and down by the Percent Variable (2% default) to form a channel.  
**MA_Timeframe:** Timeframe for the moving average above, in minutes.  
**MAtpe:** 0=close, 1=HL (manage trade or trend analysis will not work with Matype=1)  
**Percent:** the percentage amount to shift the MA bands to form the channel described above. ****  
**TradeOnFriday:** >0 trades on friday  
**Slip:** exits only  
**Lots:** The size of the lot you will be trading.   
**MaxOpenOrders:** Maximum number of positions to have open simultaneously  
**SafeArea:** ???  
**PipStep:** if position goes this amount of pips against you add another.  
**TakeProfit:** Amount of profit in Pips to exit position   
**StopLoss:** total loss on all open positions in pips  
**TrailingStopFlag:** ???  
**TrailingStop:** trailling stop value, order will be modified at BID or ADK ±TrailingStop  
**TStrigger** : Once the price hits ( TakeProfit – Tstrigger ), it cancels Ttakeprofit and puts a trailing stop.  
**MinMarginLevel:** Below this Minimum Margin Level percent % trading stops  
**TradeFrom1:** Place trades "From" - "Until"  
**TradeUntil2:** Place trades "From" - "Until"  
**Fast_Period:** ????   
**Fast_Price:** ???  
**Slow_Period:** ???  
**Slow_Price:** ???  
**DivergenceLimit:** ???  
**Use_V63D_Divergence:** 0 = Use original method for divergence, 1 = use in iFXAnalyzer  
**IncreasementType:** 0=just add every PipStep, >0 =OrdersTotal()^x *Pipstep ????????????????  
**DVLimit: :** ???  
**PipsGoal: :** ???  
**PipsLoss:** ???  
**GMT:** Your Brokers time offset from GMT. For example: if your brokers time is 23:30 and GMT is 20:30 this setting would be 3.   
**DST:** 0=Standard 1=Daylight Saving  
**OpeningHour:** ???  
**ClosingHour:** ???  
**Writelog:** ???

Hi, Sergiel  
When I have a trendline described as "Downtrend_Close_Alert_" what is happening is that when the line is breached any existing short trade has its stop loss value reduced by the Reduce_Factor (ie. Reduce_Factor = 2)   
No trades are closed and the EA is not deactivated but continues to open new short positions above the trendline.  
You have to pay attention to the spelling. Your trend description should have been: "Down**T** rend_Close_Alert_" Each word have to start with a Capital letter. **D** own, **U** p, **C** lose, **T** rade, **A** lert and be follow with "**_** " caracter. So in your description you did not have the Capital Letter on Trend so it did act on this description as it was only an Alert_00. So by having 0 as the window, in fact you did not have any space to take action that why it did not took action. That is why i recommend to put at least 40 for a 5 digit broker when you use only the Alert_xx trend line. Hope this is clear. So retry with a capital letter at the beginning of each word and it will work.  
  
I also noticed then when my "Downtrend_Close_Alert_" line is breached is removes the Alert_ part within the description. Is this normal? **Yes it is normal. The EA will reset the Alert condition otherwise it will start to osccillate while the price is around the trend line. That why you need to take action and reinitialise the EA after your modification when the trendline have been hit.

Hi TheGabriel, this is a key factor of the original FireBird. If you disable it, you will prevent to have more than 1 trade activated for a given pair![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1). If it is what you want, you can disable it by having the variable "PipSpep set ot a big number, like 10000.  
  
Good luck.  
  
Bye

Hi everyone,  
Need info on some features in the EA. Using mostly the defaults, on IBFX 4 digit broker. ReduceFactor = 3.0, PipStep = 40, TakeProfit = 100, SL = 300, TSFlag = false, TrailingStop = 50, TStrigger = 20, SafeArea = 500, PipsGoal = 500, PipsLoss = 500.  
  
I wanted to do testing on the Trend Alerts function, so I set the EA into different direction to force wrong trades - cool, no problems, it opened Sell trade Nr 1 at say 1.1000, Nr 2 then 40 pips later at 1.1040, Nr 3 then 40 pips later at 1.1080, all OK so far. THEN at 1.1100, it changed the SL of Nr 1 from 300 to 100 and closed Nr 1 at a 100pip loss! And same with Nr 2, closed for 100p loss at 1.1140, same with Nr 3 at 1.1180. But the EA SL setting is still set to 300.  
  
What setting causes the SL to automatically change like this? I did not even get as far as setting a Trend Line Alert onto the chart!  
  
When manually driving the EA, one can very easily get a 100+ pip re-tracement during a day, must be some reason why others are not having this happen to them?  
  
Appreciate your thoughts on the above.  
  
Regards,   
Andy

Hi Actionplan  
  
When I came home from work the trendline whas broken on nzdusd. Price had been below my trendline but is now over. Three open trades. Trendanalys = true and trendline description Close_.  
I thought this would close all trades and stop EA from open more trades.

Hi Andy, I am pretty sure the SL value is the combined stop loss for all open positions. So here you had 3 open positions at 100 each so your SL was triggered....

Ok, I think usdcad, audusd, eurusd, usdchf, and maybe gbpusd are turning against my driving direction.  
This is the moment of truth - let's see what the damage will be. I have halted the EA on these crosses and pulled the stop loss closer on open trades...  
  
Trying however to drive the EA short on usdjpy.

this EA could win big but lose big too. Hopefully the loss could be recovered in the long run.  
  
But Fire bird is definitely not for the faint hearted like me

You can set **MaxOpenOrders:** =1. If you want the EA to mange one position per trade.

For price action lovers...Pinocio nose pattern, usually happens at major resistance/support, and is good REVERSAL recognition.

Thanks ActionPl, I thought there was a way to fully disable it. I'm going to use it this way as long as my balance isn't that high. If I'd have like 10.000 I would keep the function on ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I can only use 0,1 lots as minimum, that's why.  
  
Thank you for the post about the settings, wish you many pips friend ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Other pips made for me, I'm testing for 1 month, seeking for 0 losses.

Hi Andy, the only way the EA will do what it did, it is because a trend line was active. A trendline is active if it have the following word in the description. "Alert_". I've noticed that we can have a lot a hold trendline when we do test and if you don't delete it, it can cause us problems. I'm working on a solution to clean those old trend line automatically. For now you have to do it manually.  
Do the following.   
1-left clic inside the chart window  
2- Do CTRL+B  
3- left clic on the Object colum to sort all objects  
4- Delete all trendline by selecting it and clic on delete  
5- close this window   
6- Save your template using the same name and override the existing one.  
7- Retry your test  
  
This way you will clean all trend object that can interfere with your testing and by refreshing your template, they will not come back.  
  
Bye

Hi Elovv, make sure to always have "Alert_" at the end of your description as a minimum if you want the EA to take action. So if i understand correctly your situation, your trend description was like that: "Close_" You should have "DownTrend_Close_Alert_" or "UpTrend_Close_Alert_" in order for the EA to close trade that was again your trend.  
  
Hope this clarify the situation.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1)

Hi dohiMojo, your interpretation is not correct. The EA manage the trade one at the time. So if you set your SL at 1000, it will use 1000 for each trade opened, even if you have 5 trade open.  
  
P.S. look at ht answer that i have provided to Andy, that could be the cause of his situation.

For Yen crosses, there is fix version. Original version won't work. Ask Actionpl if his versions 1,3 and 1,4 has yen fix, that I don't know.   
Original with Yen Fix has been posted here few times, let me know, if you won't find it.

Hi Puntalara,  
  
Not sure what it means. I have also come across another in top left corner which says "marketanalysis" - do not know what it means either - the Ea still enters trades, no problem. Later it changes back to "==trades enabled== safe to trade=="  
  
Comments anyone?

Well guys, i decided to close down metatrader and reopen, as i had the enterposition on all my 10 pairs, and it was not opening any trades - when i reopened MT4 EVERY trade had been closed - VERY glad i am in demo.  
  
Not sure why it did this ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) worrying though.

Hi  
Thank you for your system. It is a brilliant idea to use the EA. Infact I started it from 11 May and now accumulate about 400 pips. However I found that sometimes EA does not open any trade even the direction is correct. Any advice. Is it possible to use a chart to show the behaviour of 1.4? I am really confused with the function and trend line. Thank you  
  
Happy Trading

I would check the safe level I usually move it up to like 5000 that way it is not taken into account. Only seems to keep me from trading the trend lol ;P  
  
Hope this helped. ( I think the external Variable is called something like "SafePip" ? ) Not for sure off hand.

Hello all! I started to test this EA but i have a small problem. On my demo account it opens many orders, but on my live account it only opens 1 order per pair even if my MaxOrders is set to 5. Lot size is 0.10 and i got the money for more orders. Do you know why? Thank you?

I was going over the Firebird code (with actionpl's latest code) trying to understand it and I have a few questions.  
  
One, is there any reason to have BOTH the "OpeningHour" and "ClosingHour" along with the four "TradeFrom" and "TradeUntil"? They appear to both do the same thing with the exception you have a little more room & choices with the "TradeFrom" and "TradeUntil" setup.  
  
Two, if I'm reading the code correct, if you're trade goes south and you start getting "excessive loss" alerts, the way the code is written after alerting you to the "excessive loss" it won't do anything else and just let it go on.  
  
Wouldn't the better thing be when you get an "excessive loss" it should either close the open trades and not trade until you take care of the problem, or not trade but continue to manage the open trades for trend reversals etc.

You need to adjust the safearea to a higher level and the divergence limit.  
My setup is:   
SafeArea=10,000 basicaly disable it  
DivergenceLimit=0.05  
  
If you look at left top screen you will see message "divergence too low" that mean your setup is too low for the given pair. you need to find the right setup. If you put it too high, you will disable those filter and get in market that are moving too fast. It could be big winner but also traders trap. Same type of message for SafeArea.

Hi ountalara, If this comment appear and stay there for more than 10 min and you can see price changing and you have communication, it meant that your metatrader pgm is broken. Unload the program and start it again. Normally you should not see this message for more than a split second.  
  
If you see message marketAnalysis, it is that you are in a waiting time since you had a close in the last 10 min. The EA will not trade for 10 min after a close. That is a feature from the initial FireBird.  
  
Bye

FireBird will open a trade when  
1- If no trade is open, it will open a trade as soon the price go in the window define by your variable "malengh" and "Matimeframe" and Percent. Also you need to pass the filter condition for SaveArea, and Divergence then you need to have the Relative Vigor index going your way between the current bar and previous bar.  
2- it will open trade also if all the previous condition are met and that the price when agains your position by more than "pipstep" if you already have a trade open.  
  
This is quite complex but, in general, it will open trade when market retrace and that the volatility is not too high and you are on the safe side of the trendline and inside the timeperiod that you have setup.  
  
If you want to know exactly how it work, you need to look at the code and understand it.

I've never test it live. So i have look at the code and could you try the following and let me know.  
Set your last variable "writelog" to 1.  
  
This will produce a file which will follow your equity variation. If from tic to tic, your equity reduce by more than this operation: "Pipsloss * lots" it will stop openning new trade and you will have message "excessive loss". It will not close the open trades. So you need to monitor your account.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

is there any reason to have BOTH the "OpeningHour" and "ClosingHour" along with the four "TradeFrom" and "TradeUntil"? They appear to both do the same thing with the exception you have a little more room & choices with the "TradeFrom" and "TradeUntil" setup. **Your right. I did not change this section of the code. It is redundant. The only advantage is what you have mentionned. If you want to trade around news, you can do it with those variables.**  
  
Two, if I'm reading the code correct, if you're trade goes south and you start getting "excessive loss" alerts, the way the code is written after alerting you to the "excessive loss" it won't do anything else and just let it go on. **It will stop openning new positions until your equity comeback to an acceptable level. That the initial way it has been program.**  
  
Wouldn't the better thing be when you get an "excessive loss" it should either close the open trades and not trade until you take care of the problem, or not trade but continue to manage the open trades for trend reversals etc. **The way it is ritht now, it will do that only on live account and will not do anything else until price come back so your equity is back to normal. I agree with you that it seem to be dangerous. I'm open to suggestion from those who are trading live for some time. We could imrove this function after we got a concensus or implement some choice so people can select a strategy or disable it. For now it is not very flexible.  
  
Waiting for input from live traders.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

It seemed to work for me. Make sure you have that in the description and not the name. I had my Reduce Factor set to 50 when it seemed to work for me and that may have just been the reduce factor closing the Trade for me. I will try it again with reduce factor off to see if I have the same problem. Actionpl if you need farm out some of the coding work I will be more than glad to help. I am very busy too so I understand and thanks for the awesome work

I just put the HA EA vs1_3b on the eur/us. I added an ascending trendline below the prices on the daily chart and put uptrend_close_alert in the description. The EA opened a trade immediately even though the price is above the trendline. Shouldnt the EA wait to open a trade until the price drops below the TL? What did I do wrong?

Nothing special my fren, just a trendline, below is my trendline setup on my computer not in my VPS. I was just thinking that I can use trendline to draw a horisontal line also. - 300pips on that one, TL was too close to PA and SL was too tight.

Hi Bnbb  
Using the last version posted on May the 10th  
Using 50pip TP and 300SL  
I don't obey any indicator - just try to enter along when price action seems to describe a trend.   
I use trendline with description: UpTrend_Close_Alert_50 (in the case of uptrend, but I usually act manually before the alert trendline is hit. Good to have it though in case of sudden swings...  
When price action seems to describe an end to the trend I stop the EA trading, pull the stop losses of open trades just behind last high high or low low, and wait.  
Still on demo, and not long at that either. The statistical average will become apparent after a few weeks - let's hope it's a winner! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi, you can let it run. It all depend your risk tolerances. Some experience traders who are more conservative, will close all their trade on Friday et restart on Monday. You have to find your style.

Hi, for those of you who want to update to the latest version, i have clean up some variables that were not used and correct a system call that was obsolete. This should not make a significant chage for most of you. It should produce more consistent comments on top left screen, mainly when "marketanalysis" appear. This message will appear for 10 min after a close since the FireBird EA will not open a trade for 10 min after a close(with variable "Chart_Time_Frame=5"). That is an other feature that prevent the EA to initiate a new trade on fast changing market.  
  
P.S. Version 1.5 need still more foward testing in order to validate my trend cleanup fonctions.   
  
Have a good trading week.  
  
P.S. Used this template to clean your chart before attaching this EA. It should eliminate erratic operations.

One more question: What "bad hours" means? i didn't change the settings and it worked until now. My OpeningHour is 0 and ClosingHour is 24 and TradeFrom1 is 0 and TradeUntil1 is 24.  
  
Is GMT very important? Now it's set at 0 and i should put it 2.

There is a divergence limit parameter, by default it is set to 0.002. In the EA, the codes calculate the divergence for every tick and if the divergence is over 0.002 then it will show the "bad hours" message indicating it is not safe to trade.  
  
This message will show up on all JPY pairs very often.

Hi Pulainmata,  
  
Are you trading live? Are you able to open more than 1 orders by using the FireBird?

Yes i have it live and on demo same settings. On demo i have "bad hours" and on live it tells me it's safe to trade. DivergenceLimit 0.005 and Use_V63D_Divergence is set to true!

Try reading this: [http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1431](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2735710&postcount=1431)  
  
I think you don't afford to open more than 1 trade per pair because of your low equity.

Please double check if the GMT and DST are the same on live and demo. But no matter what GMT and DST are, the divergence is over the limit for sure, otherwise you won't receive the message.  
  
If the settings on live and demo are absolutely the same then the only possibility is that the data feeds from live and demo are a bit different. Maybe you are using different brokers or the same broker but provides you with a little bit different data for live and for demo.  
  
BTW, I noticed that if I set Use_V63D_Divergence to true, it opens fewer trades, so I set it to false.  
  
Good luck!

Any idea if there are fewer and with less downswings or it's just fewer?

I am not sure. It generates fewer trades during back testing, and that is why I keep it false.

Hi all,  
Can I use the EA on the daily chart directly? I notice the setting for TF in the EA is 5 min so I presume it does not matter which TF we use for the EA? Am I correct?  
Happy Trading

That's an amazing achievement for this system. Fingers crossed you can keep or even better your position. Obviously after the contest has finished we all would like your feedback and details on strategy.  
  
Good luck!

Thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)   
I'm sure that if I close the positions with the Take Profit I will get the 2nd position, it depends on how are the others doing.  
  
I have to say that I used lots of 0,5; 1 and 3. The good is that there are no losses and I manage to understand the price direction, I'll publish the strategy in details with the rules so we can work on it.  
  
I can say so far that a very important thing in forex is the "**demand and supply** " (i forgot this aspect and I had wrong ideas about forex, thinking forex was all about indicators), so you know when it's **Oversold and Overbought** with indicators like the Stochastic wich use this concept. You can trust **Stochastic only** **on Daily Chart** (maybe even H4) but that depends on the ammount of pips you want.   
  
When you understand the **price direction** , watch for **Support** and **Resistance** on the Daily chart, draw a Trendline if it helps too. If you want you can use Stochastic for both **Entry and Exit**.  
  
A powerful system has to be simple and point to the right trend direction, that's it. After that you need some Money Management for the system.  
  
In the contest there are no EA allowed so **I'm doing it manually** , I'm doing some trades in Real account too.

It's doing the same, I can't risk that much, but the pips are the same.  
  
Went from 300$ to 500$ in 2 days (minimum lot, 0,1). There's no loss fear for me anymore, I evitate losses but cut them when needed.  
I once had 3000$ (hard earned) and blew it, yes. Without proper money management you blow 300$ or 3000$, it's the same.  
  
I think in terms of pips, 200 in demo and 200 pips in real could soon be much more $ in real too.

Yes, i have lost too, i went from 500 up to 1300 then lost all.  
  
now im back with 200 and im more careful.  
Now im trying to understand how to choose the trend.  
  
I will trade with lots of 0.02 for a while and get some experience.

[Dear TheGabriel,](http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=101637)  
  
Do you mind to share with us your setting and how to read the price action? Can I use the EA on daily chart and draw the trend line directly on the daily chart? Currently I put the EA on 5M chart. One more question: if the trend is not so strong and the price is in a range, do you suggest to turn on the EA to "long and short" with lower TP or simply shut it down?  
thank you very much  
I hope you can win the contest.  
  
Happy trading

Yes you can select any timeframe you want. The EA will do his thing according to your trendline on whatever timeframe you trace it.  
  
Bye

IF you have this message, it mean that there is no price action or your Metatrader is stuck. If price change, close your metratrader and restart it. Message init should not stay more than 15 sec when price is changing on your pair.

When you say that you are trading manually, do you mean that you are not using a version of the Firebird EA. Could you make clear what your current set up is.

Hi Action,  
  
Do you know how call THV3 Trend by using iCustom function?  
  
I am trying to figure out a way to automatically exit by using THV3 Trend. The idea is to automatically exit when the color turns yellow on daily chart. I know it can be done manually, but it would be nice to do it automatically in case we are busy and cannot access the computer.  
  
Thank you very much!

I guess we have the same style of trading, things like divergence, S/R, PA, De Mark are way more powerfull than most indis. (IMO). Courently Im studying a little about Tom De Mark's Sequential, and how powerfull can it be on daily charts. It can gives very early countertrend signals.   
  
I was to late, to register on that contest, and I would be in Balkan devision also. Wish you much success in that...

Lost my contest position for now, because of an opened position that went against me (GBP/JPY, the GBP/USD though is reaching the highest in 4 months ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)), but it will close with profit so I'm confident.  
  
Never heard about Tom De Mark's Sequential, I'll search and see how it can help on daily chart ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I don't use any EA, it's only manual trading, robots are not allowed for the contest and humans can do better too. I'll be back on robot after the contest ends.  
  
I'm improving day after day the entry points so I can't share nothing right now. I only had 1 trade that went against me, it didn't touch the SL so I'm fine, It's going positive right now.  
  
**Right now:** Only watching **EUR/GBP** (**EUR/USD is rising too** , I think the Euro/Pound will make a support soon and **we can buy for 100 pips**), GBP/JPY will close soon with profit and so GBP/USD (those two have to be checked for a breakout with many pips if it will come)  
  
To get it clear, _**in the contest I'm risking more even for trades of 20 pips with big lot size**_ , In **real I filter small trades** and trade only on Stochastic Divergence with 100 Pips TP and 60 pips trailing.  
  
See [this post to get the Stochastic Divergence](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=2715174&highlight=stochastic+divergence#post2715174) indicator. The template is changed, I think I'll start a new thread for this system as the EA is no longer involved and we don't want to mess everything up.

Margin call for me guys, so 0 $balance in real.  
  
**GBP/JPY** trade went to 17+ pips for the last time and went against me again for 200 pips.  
  
Then I opened 2 trades, **BUY EUR/GBP** and**SELL GBP/JPY**. I think they'll go into the direction i predicted, but, I've opened 2 trades with a small account at the same tame, so **a retracement for both** currencies blown my account definetely.  
**  
Learned (hope so) lessons today:  
**  
**1)** When you're too confident you blow out your account, when you're afraid it's even worse.  
**2)** GBP/JPY and GBP/USD can move even 300 pips a day so you need a good sum of money to trade them.  
**3)** If a trade goes against you for long time and it goes positevely get even a small profit but it's still a profit.  
**4)** Set long term goals, I want to make this happen, I want to trade for a living, this is just another step to be taken so I'm accepting this loss as part of the game that played me today.  
  
  
Now back to hard earn money ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)...  
I wish you all succes guys and plenty of pips.

Multumesc (thanks) Paromi,   
  
The Margin call it's for the live account, I'm leaving everything right now, I'm quitting the contest too.  
  
I'm gonna work on this strategy combined with the firebird EA to have better entry/exit points.   
  
For now, I'm getting back to online projects (websites) wich can get me some money without any risk.   
Forex is a great opportunity, too bad to not take advantage of it, but we have to be perfect because every moment in the markets is unique, it can blow or double your account ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
Strange, this is the first time i blow the account and I'm "kinda happy"... lol  
  
Keep it up folks!

Ouch! Are you using the EA on live account, or you follow the EA manually?  
  
It looks like the EA needs some good money management strategy.

Hi all guru,  
Since we have the daily rule to decide which way to trade and Firebird to trigger a trade, can we combine them all together to have a 'complete' EA to trade automatically?  
Happy Trading.  
p.s. I have followed the daily rules and used firebird to trade since 1 May, now my account up 10%.

You're right, though the trade I closed manually to leave that 150$ into the account, now would have been closed with take profit....it had been in range for 3-4 days....

When I back test FireBird, I found that if you trade with 0.1 lots, it is easy to get a -$600 drawdown in no more than 3 days (I use 150 pips stop loss, if I use 300 pips I double the loss). But of course it will quickly gain back.  
  
So make sure you have more than $2000 in your account if you want to trade with 0.1 lots.  
  
Another thing I found is very useful is to set Manage_Trade to True, and set Index to 1. This way if the previous 4hr bar is red, the EA will stop trading. That way you may lose some good oppurtunities but you are protected well too.

How many currencies you were trading for a -600 drawdown? That can be avoided if you set a very big number for the pipstep so it doesn't open new positions if the trade goes against you.

Just one pair -- GPBUSD.  
  
Here is the details. From Jan 16 ~ Jan 19, there are 4 losses for a total of -$600  
  
Keep in mind this is backtesting, so it is fully automatic. In real world, I may be able to control that loss by close orders or turn off the EA. But I may make wrong decisions, I would rather let the EA work by itself. The only thing I want to adjust is the lot size, if I am not sure, I will use smaller lot size, once I am sure I will use bigger lot size (It is really hard to decide ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) ). I don't want to close orders since a pending drawdown may become a winner.

Yea you are paying your tuition fee we all go through the process. I have blown four accounts, so I am no stranger. Thank God now i making profits. The difference between a successful trader and an unsuccessful trader is not the system the use is thier thinking, thier pysch. The market will go where it wants to go our job is to follow it and not get ahead of it. Thats why the most important skill in forex is to know when to take a loss and reverse you position, let the market lead.I think you should read **trading in the zone** it is an eye opener. And for all newbies out there pls leave those jpy and cable monsters alone if you do not understand currency correlation, go learn the trade ropes with Eur Usd and understand when the market is in risk aversion mode or risk appetite drive, This is particularly important for knowing which direction to drive the EA.

I was following this thread up to about a month back when I stumbled on a fully automated EA. Just to inform SamuraiPower that a fully automatic EA now exists because he said he would like to hear of any such.   
  
It's an aggressive scalper EA that works only on pairs with 1-2 pip spread max. Although the original EA called ISEA am told, works with Sigma forex but I'll never trust that broker with 1 cent of mine!  
  
So I simply got an excellent coder to study how the EA works and I got it at a good discount. Works 24/5 without any form of intervention though I use moderate to conservative settings for my dozens of managed accounts. It's great for my portfolio as an account manager as am now able use my time to simply keep recruiting more clients than ever. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f973.png?v=15.1)  
  
Also added 2 more hours to my sleep time, LOL ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f634.png?v=15.1)  
  
Here's their statement:   
<http://sigmaforex.mt4live.com/>  
<http://isea.mt4live.com/>   
  
BTW: My EA trades more like the first unlike the second. Besides, which broker will let you trade mammoth lots like the latter, or even let you cash out their $$$ that fast? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)Not in your wildest imagination

I tried with tp more than 100pips seems its not an optimum tp, i think 100pips is the optimum setting for the tp since the ea got a max profit but in low range market 50pips tp and lower sl might be the optimum one.

Just to inform u, first time trading as a newbie trying to predict the market movement was a hard task, clueless most of the time, but by watching and learn daily tf behaviour gives me a clue on how i trade on smaller time frame, i manage to spot many high probabilty setup with minimum risk, i loss a small pips when i had a loosing trade. mhmm.. just interesting watching my self gain experience

Your statements are just amazing. And the lots ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f633.png?v=15.1).  
  
I thought about trading for a few pips with big lots but you need to catch that pips very fast so the trade would not go against you. What timeframe does your EA use, is it a custom EA?  
It opens multiple trades at a time?

Hi Baby001,  
here the code to access to the info from this indicator. Thv3_trend_R is for the Red bar, _G for Green and _Y for Yellow  
Thv3_trend_R=iCustom(NULL,Thv3_trend_timeperiod,"Thv3 trend",NULL,0,1);   
Thv3_trend_G=iCustom(NULL,Thv3_trend_timeperiod,"Thv3 trend",NULL,1,1);   
Thv3_trend_Y=iCustom(NULL,Thv3_trend_timeperiod,"Thv3 trend",NULL,2,1);   
  
Let us know if you your strategy is giving you good results. My test did not show very good results.  
  
bye

Those statements aren't mine, but is customized based on how their EA trades; just similar. The EA is more profitable on 5m than 15m and higher.   
  
Only 1 trade per pair at a time but opens pending orders just a few pips away from current price so that another trade is quickly entered just after one locks up profits.

Hi theforexpert,  
  
Are you going to start a new thread on FF or an website for this EA?  
  
Will it work with any Brokers?  
Ex: IBFX, ALPARI(uk), ALPARI(us), FXDD, [FXPRO](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile")  
  
Do you need indicators to make it work?  
  
Can you send PDF's, Templates and Set files?  
  
Thank you for you're time

Yea **Trading in the Zone** will do you a world of good. Trends in forex are determined by market sentiments based on economic factors. When the fundamentals are sounding good, risk appetite increases the market is in a bullish tone and tend to buy Aud, Nzd, Gbp,Cad and Euro in that order while selling the usd and yen. On the other hand bad economic news induces risk aversion and there will be a stong sells of Aud,Nzd,Gbp,Cad and Euro while buying Usd, Yen. So by looking at the pairings of the risk apetite currencies to the risk aversion( safe haven) currencies on your chart you will immediately know where the market is and if you are using the EA know what side to drive the EA.   
  
In summary risk appetite or risk aversion sentiments determine the trends in the forex market. You do not need to stay glued to any news service or so called economic analyst, your charts will tell you what sentiments rule the market. For instance the meduim term trend is bullish the dollar is being sold off and the yen will soon start giving back its gains. For those trading GU with the EA, pls use a 300 pips stop loss for current market conditions, cable is presently too volatile the safe play is eur usd. Samurai thank you for this wonderful thread.

Great explenation, I'll read it soon. As far as I can tell you i've read about risk appetite on expert's analysis and I've never gone further, too bad, maybe I would have come across the book earlier, better later than never.  
  
Thank you, really appreciate what you're sharing with us.

Use this small app <http://wordrider.net/freerapid/> very good if you dont have premium account (between downloads prog wait 15min, it necessarily). In night speed is about 250KB/s. I have small upload at home.  
I use this EA two weeks. You must follow trend and set up right long or short trades.....

Hi okehiedon,  
  
Is the book " Trading in the Zone" by author Mark Douglas? I want to get it but there are a couple of other books with similar names and I want to be sure it is the right one..  
  
Thanks.

Hi Action,  
  
Thank you so much for your help!  
  
I am now able to use the THV Trend indicator along with Phil's 5 min strategy ( I use it on daily chart) and I am able to implement a fully automatic version of this EA. However, it shows mixed result in back test. It works OK with GPBUSD but not good at all with EURUSD. So overall, it is not as good as manually driving the EA. But stop the EA when the THV3 Trend turns yellow will definitely help.

Thanks for the reply, and thanks for the links to the ebooks - I'm sure it will provide many hours of fun reading.  
  
Can you recommend other books the further describe the way pairs trade in bullish/bearish modes.  
  
I really liked your last post about risk appetite and risk aversion. I pulled up a chart and overlaid all the pairs you mentioned and it is amazing how closely they follow each other. This was very enlightening to me.  
  
So, far I have always been evaluating each pair as a stand-alone trade. But now I see that I should be looking at other pairs to gauge how they all will move...

Hi,  
Place the EA in say 4H chart, then set **Chart_Time_Frame:** to 5M - this will monitor the 5M time frame to enter trades, The trend lines for reducing /closing the SL can them be drawn on the 4H chart. 5M chart need not appear on your screen, although I have it up permanently.

I just want to address 2 issues quickly before we loose focus on this forum. This is a great forum, I don't know about others, but for me, this is the best EA I have come accross.  
  
The first issue is that i want you guys to know that TheGabriel did not get a margin call with this EA, some people thought thats what happened, maybe he needs to clearify that part more specifically (though he did mention it a couple of times).  
  
Also, for theforexpert, all i can say is congratulations to you on your EA. I hope you keep making the money, but all I can see is commercial, if you think the EA is that good maybe you should put it in a contest, you will get more customers that way or try to open another forum for your EA. I'm amazed how people fall for little things, the fact that somebody shows you an account doesn't necessarily means that it's from that EA or a modified statement. This is the reason why most of us loose money all the time, because we never learn from our mistakes, how many times have you bought a blakcbox EA with all the promise in the world only to end up with a margin call.   
Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not against his EAs, all i'm saying is, these two guys, Samurai and Actionpl have put so much time an energy just to make the Firebird EA perfect all for free, but because there is no price tag attached to it we think it doesn't work. I'm telling you, this EA works, if you really take time to study it, i have made more money trading with this EA than with any other EAs I have ever used. Hey, what I mean is, be careful what you fall for, this is your chance to make your own blackbox, you get your questions and responses answered without any charge, no private PMs, no private list, nothing is private, its all open, anything private has a private agenda. Please, give it up to this 2 guys, and keep the sanctity of this forum, take time to learn the EA, the code is open to you, and the 2 guys are very humble, they answer almost all questions, you don't have to go with the latest updated EA, get use to one, like me, i'm still using the v3.1a, and its still making money. Please, you've spent too much time and money to get burnt again, you came to make money so concentrate, learn, and make it, don't fall for what you don't know, it's called forex and not gambling.   
Well i guess I got too emotional there, but it got to be said. I'm not out to accuse anybody or point fingers, its just my 2cents.

Thanks for the complement, most of the things I have learnt about the correlation of pairs is by watching the market. I think you are doing the right thing by watching the charts, for example this afternoon (EST) risk aversion crept in to the market, the dollar has reached support levels on most pairs. The euro is being hammered, however not by the dollar but the pound and thats why the pound is not dropping of so much. Best play is to continue buy the dips of the pound until the 4hr trendline is broken or look for opportunities to fade eur usd rallies.   
  
Another tip I would give you is that the movements of the yen pairs are controlled by Usd Jpy. If the yen is stronger than the dollar do not try buying GJ, EJ or AJ or vice versa.  
  
Secondly if Eurusd and GbpUsd are looking bullish and you do not know which to trade, just open a chart of eur gbp and you will see which is stronger and you will be taking a high probability trade.  
  
By applying this methodology you will know what direction to drive the EA if you are using it or you will know what direction to trade and this would give you more confidence. Cheers.

I would like to state emphatically that the fire bird ea is wonderful and i have results to prove it and I am also using the EA on a life acct i opened for just EAs. The EA will get you in at pullbacks in the direction of the trend and as long as the trend is intact the EA profits. It is your knowledge of knowing when the current trend is completed and thier is a reversal coming up that will determine your success with the EA. Actionpl and samurai may God bless you guys.

I hope you keep making the money, but all I can see is commercial, if you think the EA is that good maybe you should put it in a contest, you will get more customers that way or try to open another forum for your EA. I'm amazed how people fall for little things, the fact that somebody shows you an account doesn't necessarily means that it's from that EA or a modified statement. This is the reason why most of us loose money all the time, because we never learn from our mistakes, how many times have you bought a blakcbox EA with all the promise in the world only to end up with a margin call.

  
  
Behold the ramblings of a loser! Was informed and got shocked to see this post, sighed and felt I should walk over it but on second thots...  
  
First, I'm sorry if I forgot to say this when I posted that info. My hats go off to Samurai, Action and every other person for their great contributions to this thread/forum; except of course, _ayo_..say what?   
  
Next, Samurai more than once, jokingly said if anyone knows of a fully automated EA, then he should be informed. This made me search for this thread to do just that in good faith. Further, I opted for PMs for just 2 reasons: not to deviate the focus of this thread with respect to Samurai and others; and 'cause I simply don't have time to start a new thread for this.  
  
A lot of folks out there need help with priceless info on what will enhance their trading like it works for the big boys. Those who PM-ed me for more info will confirm that I dropped them the exact same strategy that was used to make my EA so they could code theirs too. Non-programmers who asked to buy were directed straight to the coder. Many were glad they did PM, so am I that I could help.  
  
Like I told some, I don't sell EAs for a living neither am I a coder. Humbly speaking, I run million dollar accounts for high net worth individuals so for the life of me, this rambler should know I can't source such clients here! We all know that forums mostly consist of retail traders to help each other out.  
  
I could go on but why waste time on a butthead? So pls, no more PMs 'cause there won't be any answers.  
  
Sadly, a long story like this is what you get when U're being accused wrongly. My apologies again for this needless distraction but I just couldn't watch this dude get away with his rant.  
  
I rest my case!

From the tips to the dips, it's all about the pips

Hi, here the version 1.5a, i have skip the vs 1.5, was not working correctly.  
This version enable you to setup your EA with both long and short. The way you control the EA side is by identifying the main trend in the trendline description. With this version no need to check your EA side.  
  
"Main_UpTrend_Alert_" This description will be equivalent to Only Long. "Main_DownTrend_Alert_" will be equivalent to Only Short.  
  
You can have all the other trendlines descriptions from the other versions, But make sure you have only one trendline with "Main_" in the description. It will still work if you have more than one with "Main_" in your description, it will take the last one draw with "Main_" in it. But it is not a good habit since it confuse the situation.  
  
This version will also clean your chart from old trendlines that produce erratic results. Parameter "Trend_line_Keep" control the number of trendline that you want on the chart.  
  
This version will not check for excessive lost on real account. This was not very reliable so i removed it.  
  
Hope this is not too complex to setup. Once you are used to that way to describe your trendline, you will not go back to the previous version. It is also more stable and have a better status description on the left corner.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Best of luck to all.

hi vinesh,  
u can find the link in my signature below this text, the setting is no diff with previous modified ea by actionpl. im still using v3.b on v1.4. the main point is how to fill the trendline description, reading from arround page 70 will answer most of the question.

Hi SP  
Geat job.  
In your set, the reduce factor is well 20 and not 2.0 ?  
And why Trendline_Watch is false ?

Depends on the situation, sometimes i set reduce factor to make the stoploss to a specific value and thus make the trendline function to halt new trade only, i do that when i feel doubt bout trend direction but still want to trade with minimum risk, and sometimes i set trendline as sl. i set trendline watch to false coz i want the ea trade imidiately. i think this ea provide many features that we can use fits our strategy.

It mean that there is no Trendline with a description having "Main_" in it  
If you have it, Check your spelling, You need Majuscule letter at the beginning of each word. Ex. for a uptrend. Ex. Main_UpTrend_Alert_

Hi guys.  
Hi Samurai Power & Actionpl.  
For the first, i wanna say big thanks for your work.  
I have read all this topic and now in my head some porridge![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1) Because my english is wery bad.   
Yesterday there was a first day of trade with vs 1.3a. Have some results. +100 pips on GBPUSD for long, and 1 order on USDCAD still on market (short). And today i have new long on GBPUSD.   
  
I am still not understand how to identify change of trend. Look at my picture USDCAD.jpg   
Price goes down by blue regress channel. In the round we can see breakout of this channel. I am move stoploss to last maximum (about 200 pips) and draw a new channel (green). Green channel have new angle. When i get up in the morning, i see the price reflection from the channel.   
This moments still have confused me.....  
  
And now i have a question to Actionpl or maybe who know. Can i move trendline when EA is working and price not still hit to line?

As i see in source we dont realy need this indicator, i think you can just comment line :   
double Auto_Trend_current=iCustom(NULL,AutoTrend_timeperiod,"5-8openEMA_arrow",9,15,2,0);

cooper3000 from the 1.5a version you need to manually draw a trendline. if you don't know how to do it just use 1.3 version and set it manually on long or short according to the daily trend.

Canni is right, this indicator is not needed in this version.  
I forgot to remove this piece of code that i was working on to automated the EA, it did not produce good results. So this version 1.5b i have removed the unneaceassy line of code.

Your right, version 1.5b does not need to change your setup for Only long or Only Short as long as you put the right description in your trend line.  
  
See my previous post to see how it need to be enter.  
  
You can put what you need on variable slip and safe area.

Yesterday I have made a mistake. I was edit "Pipstep" to 0, and when price hit the TL EA opened 4 new orders on GBPUSD. This mistake gives me 400 pips of profit to my DEMO acc. But is very dangerously for live account![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62c.png?v=15.1)  
Now i understand, if i not want use a pipstep, i must set this value more than SL.

If you don't want to enter trade due to pipstep rule you need to assign a large number. Let it make to 10000. This way you will never enter a trade on pull back except for the first one. Doing that you will have only 1 trade open in the direction you drive.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

The only way i can think that this will happen is that you have a trendline that is there that was hit. Check the Object list to see how many trendline there is on your chart. Since the alert_ is remove at each time a trendline is hit, it should work the next time you set up your Main trendline.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)

Hi okehiedon, I also kept getting the "excessive loss" alert and could not figure out why. So I went into the code and turned it off.  
  
Here is how I did it.  
1\. open the EA in the editor. (Right click on the EA name and select Modify)  
2\. when the editor opens, select EDIT then select FIND  
3 in the FIND WHAT box type in "Excessive" then click on the FIND NEXT button.  
4\. It will then highlight the line with "excessive" in it. (See the attached Picture)  
5\. Add the /* and the */ to the line as shown in the attached pictures  
6\. then press the F5 button to run the compiler.   
  
Done...  
  
Cheers, DojiMojo

Use version 1.5b and you will not have any of this problem. Make sure you understand well how it work with demo before switching to real account.

i thought someone said stop loss was total stop loss for all open positions? for me it is each position in that currency...is there a way to cap the loss on all open positions in one currency in case it moves against me drastically?

Afaik, just drop trendline on chart with description "Close_Trade_Alert", by touching this line EA will close all open positions.

Another way is if price going trough trade trendline, then stoploss on open position will be reduced by Reduce_factor, if i right understand.

It seems like a lot of members are using different indicators to determine long term trend. Any idea which indicators seem to work best. I was using trend and nonlagtrend but discovered they repaint. Thanks for the help.

The original MA cross over Indicator and the Ash seems to do alright. I usually watch them very closely for the daily time frame. Also I try to take note of any candle patterns such as hanging man or doji or any other patterns that could signify a reversal approaching. I also try to plot Support and Resistance on Daily and 4hr time frames(Using Different Colors) so that I that I can be prepared for a reversal if it hits one of those target areas. Other then those the trendline function the ActionPL has added is great for stopping a trade that goes bad. GL and happy trading ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Guys, a helping hand here. The trendline i drew is correct or some more refining required.  
  
One thing for sure my screen shot taking ability needs a bit of refining. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hi,  
  
I have read the whole thread. First, thank you SamuraiPower and Actionpl for this great idea and the EA.  
I want to be sure if I understood it correctly. Here is my setup for a fresh new demo account:  
  
1\. Chart is D1 EURUSD  
  
2\. I put the Firebird-v63H04_H_Ashi_Trend_vs1_5b.mq4 EA on the chart.  
  
3\. Main parameters:  
TrendAnalysis=true  
TrendLine_watch=false  
Reduce_factor=2.0  
Trend_line_Keep=3  
AutoTrend_Timeperiod=240  
Manage_Trade=false  
Chart_Time_Frame=5  
  
4\. I drew a trendline (see picture) and named it as Main_UpTrend_Close_Alert_20  
  
Is it OK to start demo trading with these settings, or something is missing or not correct?

Last week I happened across this thread. I was very impressed with the amount of work being done by so many people as well as the international flavor of the participants.  
  
Three days ago I created a demo account with IBFX and started trading Firebird-v63H04_H_Ashi_Trend_vs1_5b. I have since taken 3 longs on the EURUSD and 2 on the GBPUSD each for 100 pips!  
  
Like many others, I am still not clear on all of the variables of Firebird. To help myself and others, I've created a Word document that explains the things I think I know and leaves blanks in the areas that I question. May I ask those that are knowledgeable with Firebird to read this document and supply comments. I will update the document and repost it as needed.

hi all,  
the most important to drive this EA is to find when it starts the trend. HA or 5/8 alert, sometimes it is too late. anyone has an effective trending indicator to determine the trend? currently i am using CCI but it is not so "accurate".   
regards,  
happy trading

This manual will be very useful once it completed.  
Here are some comments. Note, that I still learn the system so I may be wrong. I hope Actionpl will come and takes the time to review the manual.  
  
1\. The v63H04 (in the name of the expert) is the version number of the original EA which served as a base for the manual driven version.  
  
2\. If an integer number is added at the end of the description of the trendline (e.g. "Main_DownTrend_Alert_20") then the trading will be stopped if the price closes the trendline with 20 pips or less. The trading will also be stopped if there is a gap (e.g. on the weekend) and the price emerges on the other side of the trendline.  
  
3\. EmailAlert will send Email notification if the trendline is broken or - if the number is set - the price closes the trendline by ZZ pips (e.g. "Main_DownTrend_Alert_ZZ" where ZZ is an integer number).  
  
4\. PopupAlert will display a popup alert in MT4 if the trendline is broken or price closes to the trendline as described above.  
  
5\. Trend_line_Keep: the EA cleans your chart from old trendlines that produce erratic results. This parameter controls the number of trendline that you want on the chart.  
  
6\. Manage_Trade: if true, then the EA will disable the trade if the Heiken Ashii indicator goes against our driving direction.  
  
7\. (from the v1.4 version, the quotes are from Actionpl)   
'If you put the following description in your trend line: DownTrend_Close_Alert_  
As soon the price action will go above the trend line, it will close all sell open trade if it is a DownTrend. If you put as description UpTrend_Close_Alert_ all buy open trade will be close.  
  
This will version will also included the trade hedging function as described in previous post.  
If the description is: DownTrend_Trade_Alert_20 it will initiate a buy trade when the price action will be 20 pips above your trend line. As soon the price action will go above your trend line, it reduce the stoploss by the factor that you have given in the "Reduce_factor" variable. Same functionality for the UpTrend but with a sell trade.'  
  
'A trend line with the following word "Close_" will act as described in my previous post. And a trend line with "Trade_" in it will intiate a hedge trade when the trend line is hit.  
Note: If the Trendline with a Close in it is hit, the EA will stop trading waiting for your intervention. Any other trendline that is hit will toogle the EA state between able to trade and unable to trade.'  
  
8\. TrendLineWatch: (quote from Actionpl) 'If you set variable TrendLineWatch to true, the system will not trade up to a point where the price action hit a trend with an Alert set to it. So if the pair does not trend, you can set two trends on up and one down with Alert to it. When one of those will be hit the system will start to trade the way you have selected.'  
  
9\. More parameters are described in the source of the EA. To see them, open the Firebird-v63H04_H_Ashi_Trend_vs1_5b.mq4 with Notepad.

Price action is the best indicator with not redrawn. I am use only price action. Trendline or supportressistance breakoutsbounces, patterns (bottoms, head & sholders.....). Samurai Power was posted links to good threads about price action. I am read them all.

Maybe the name of one of your trendlines is empty?

After reading through the thread I am getting more and more confused.  
  
Samuraipower, says to use HA with MA10 on daily and then use the EA on 5 min TF.   
  
The driving of the EA depends on the direction of the MA on the daily chart. If indicators are down, go "Sell only", if up, go "Buy only"  
  
Further, reading confuses me on two things:  
  
1\. Which TF to put the new EA on?  
  
My guess is 5 mins.   
  
2\. If EA is on 5 mins, then how to control it?  
  
Is it by the use of trendlines et al?

Hi vicky_ag,  
  
That is correct, but u have to have a basic on where u are gonna put the trendline as a stoploss, this thread gives me a very usefull method on where to put the trendline correctly, its PA method, u will find it very interesting, Im using it along with my system, its doing great. Read the PDF file on first post (its a must).  
PS: U dont have to draw trendline diagonally, u can also draw trendline horisontaly for much easier understanding.

Hi footy,  
  
The indicator I put on the first post is only to help me for confirmation, yes its late recognizing the trend reversal of course and its repaint, the best indicator is PA, most of succesfull trader using PA and trendline, so I think I should learn from succesfull trader to get a good result.

Thanks Canni.  
  
If, you dont mind, one question more. Previously, we used to drive the EA based on the movement on D1 chart.  
  
Does, the new EA require driving? I mean, once the price goes through the trendline we drew, do we need to activate it again?   
  
And, do we require to tell the EA to go long when we have a longish trendline?

Just learned one helluva lesson. Trying to trade off D1 chart using HA wiped out my demo account.  
  
I checked 5 mins and guess what? we had a solid downtrend not visible on D1 using the HA.  
  
Going now totally by PA no HA for me now.

Tried the latest version.   
  
I dont get the use of the trend line and the Main_Trendline_Alert_20 or something.  
  
Isnt that supposed to close the trade when the trade has moved by 20 on the trendline ??

What were trading? How many trades did you allow it to take? Today I did not do well, but was limited to 5 bad trades.

**Hi see my comment in blue.  
  
**1\. The v63H04 (in the name of the expert) is the version number of the original EA which served as a base for the manual driven version. ok  
  
2\. If an integer number is added at the end of the description of the trendline (e.g. "Main_DownTrend_Alert_20") then the trading will be stopped if the price closes the trendline with 20 pips or less. The trading will also be stopped if there is a gap (e.g. on the weekend) and the price emerges on the other side of the trendline.**The interger will have an effect only with the following description "Alert_20" or a trendline with Trade_ in it. See the updated word file that i just published.**  
  
3\. EmailAlert will send Email notification if the trendline is broken or - if the number is set - the price closes the trendline by ZZ pips (e.g. "Main_DownTrend_Alert_ZZ" where ZZ is an integer number).**Only if trendline is broken. See new word file**  
  
4\. PopupAlert will display a popup alert in MT4 if the trendline is broken or price closes to the trendline as described above.  
  
5\. Trend_line_Keep: the EA cleans your chart from old trendlines that produce erratic results. This parameter controls the number of trendline that you want on the chart.  
  
6\. Manage_Trade: if true, then the EA will disable the trade if the Heiken Ashii indicator goes against our driving direction.  
  
7\. (from the v1.4 version, the quotes are from Actionpl)   
'If you put the following description in your trend line: DownTrend_Close_Alert_  
As soon the price action will go above the trend line, it will close all sell open trade if it is a DownTrend. If you put as description UpTrend_Close_Alert_ all buy open trade will be close.  
  
This will version will also included the trade hedging function as described in previous post.  
If the description is: DownTrend_Trade_Alert_20 it will initiate a buy trade when the price action will be 20 pips above your trend line. As soon the price action will go above your trend line, it reduce the stoploss by the factor that you have given in the "Reduce_factor" variable. Same functionality for the UpTrend but with a sell trade.'  
  
'A trend line with the following word "Close_" will act as described in my previous post. And a trend line with "Trade_" in it will intiate a hedge trade when the trend line is hit.  
Note: If the Trendline with a Close in it is hit, the EA will stop trading waiting for your intervention. Any other trendline that is hit will toogle the EA state between able to trade and unable to trade.'  
  
8\. TrendLineWatch: (quote from Actionpl) 'If you set variable TrendLineWatch to true, the system will not trade up to a point where the price action hit a trend with an Alert set to it. So if the pair does not trend, you can set two trends on up and one down with Alert to it. When one of those will be hit the system will start to trade the way you have selected.'  
  
9\. More parameters are described in the source of the EA. To see them, open the Firebird-v63H04_H_Ashi_Trend_vs1_5b.mq4 with Notepad.[/quote]

I am also working on a Manual for this EA. Part of what I put together, you have already updated and recapped nicely in your version - GREAT JOB!  
  
I have attached part of what I put together that might be a nice addition to your manual if you don't already have this information.   
  
Cheers !

Hi Every1  
AS I can see a lot has happened since the last time I posted. And I am glad the improvement is still going. I am still using the orignal version from the start of this thread and I have no regrets, have been using it for over two months on live account (amazing results not without loses though) and the losses are usually paid for without troubles. My style is patience if the move is on the way four to five session I dont force my way in I look for other opportunities or wait for few day of reversal and get in.  
Also I use the TIP  
<http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?TIP>  
To give me a feel of the likely direction of the USD. It is negatively correlated to the USD.  
SamP and Action... keep up the good work (Other I didnt forget you, keep the flag flying) SamP Congrat how is the baby boy doing?  
My best regards  
Ollypips

Hey ActionPL,  
  
Got a question: Shouldn't trading be all closed and stopped this way? See picture. I got Main_DownTrend_Close_Alert_20 on my trend line description.   
I'm quessing I shouldn't write word ''Close'' in my main trend line, is that correct?  
  
Regards,

Actionpl; I placed the 1.5b on 4 hr tf but showed waiting for main trend all day, I just switched it to the Daily and then I finally had enabled to trade. I wonder why. Secondly in the word document, I do not understand how we are going to draw another trendline on the 4 hr or 1 hr chart when the Main_UpTrend_Alert_ is on the daily chart. Won't switching time frames affect the ea. **You can have an other trendline with a description “DownTrend_Alert_” to manage your trade more closely than the main trendline which is normaly base on the daily chart. The other trendline could be setup on 4hr or 1 hr charts as you wish.**

**Your right, this trade should be closed as soon the trendline is hit.  
P.S. you don't have to put any number at the end of the Alert for a Close.  
Your description should have been. "Main_DownTrend_Close_Alert_"  
  
I will verify with the simutator to see if i can reproduce this using the Main trendline.  
I will let you know.

**HI, Normally if you see waiting for main trend, it mean that the EA does not recognize your Main trend description. Verify the spelling. If everything is ok, re-initialize the EA by using Key F7 and enter. When you switch time frame, you re-initialize the EA, i think it's why the EA start when you switch to a daily timeframe.  
  
Question#2. You can have as many trendline draw on the chart as you want. Only the trendline with Main in the description will drive your EA long or short. All the others will react to your description. Remember, The EA will switch between normal trade to broken state and back to normal trade each time price action will hit a trendline with an Alert_ in the description.  
Switching time frames will not cause the EA to go wrong. It has his own timeframe control. Switching time frame on your chart is only what you see, the EA is not using the time frame that you see to take action. It use what you have set on the variable "Chart_Time_Frame"  
  
Hope this does not confuse you more. Try it on the simulator to see how it work.  
  
Bye.

Hi, I'm having a similar problem and I've checked my spelling and it seems to be ok. It started out ok and made a few trades but when I saw what I thought was a trend reversal, I deleted the first trend and added a new trend. I included a screenshot so you can see how I drew the trendline and the description. Still not quite sure what I've done wrong.

Hi, according to your screenshot, your description is not right. You should have a capital letter to trend. It should look like this. "Main_UpTrend_Alert_"  
  
Also if your EA is stuck in the init state and you see that there is trading going on, try to re-initialize the EA, if it stuck in the init mode, exit the metatrader and restart it.   
  
Bye

So Ok now.  
I downloaded latest ea. And read manual there is written **How the Code Works**  
  
Firebird-v63H04_H_Ashi_Trend_vs1_5b is a fully automated code set regarding entry and exit points but does require the manual placement and naming of an up or down trend line.  
  
  
So i put ea on 4H eurusd that heikenashi now is white colored for long trend but no trades no nothing. I am sorry maybe i misundestood something?  
Oh and also i placed trend line and named it Main_UpTrend_Alert_  
And nothing.....4H timeframe I work.

Hi  
Looking at your chart top left corner, it displays "Waiting for Main Trend", this means it does not recognize your trend line. Coding or spelling in your trend-line object is wrong. Double click on your trend-line, then right click on it, select "trend-line properties" option, then "common" - "description" and enter the description as "Main_UpTrend_Alert_". Then, if the EA sees your trendline, it will display in top left, the description "== trades enabled == safe to trade ==".

terrible i am an idiot. Sorry all working well.....  
i was writing not in Description i was writing in NAME.  
  
So the ea now can work on whatever chart i put is not neccessary to use template for tend recognizing on Daily and ea on 5m?   
  
Now ea writes "== trades enabled == safe to trade ==".  
Thanks for help.  
Still no trades opened but i hope will.

Please, does the "TS" change the "Stop Loss" in coordination with "Take Profit" and "TS trigger" ONLY as described in "FB EA Settings" )?  
  
Or does it also in a "normal manner" separatelly? I was in profit 70 pips,  
Trailling Stop=40, TStrigger=20, Trailing Stop Flag=true, no trend lines in a graph, and my stoploss hasn't changed.  
( I hope you understand me ... )  
Thank you!

Before anything I just want to say a big thank you to Samuria and Actionpl for all the great contributions as per this EA. This is one of the best EA I have come across and I must say I'm making money on my live account with it. Earlier this week I started playing with some settings on the EA on my Demo account, this is what I came up with and I decided to let it run so I can see the outcome. The EA is set to trade fully automatic (both long and short).

First I want to thank Samurai and Actionpl. I have learned allot from your generous contributions. In testing EA vs1_5b with EU on the simulator I have a question with the "UpTrend_Close_Alert_" TD command. I chose the period 2009 06 11 - 2009 06 12. After setting the "Main_UpTrend_Alert_" on the daily chart the simulator generated four buys. I had set the "Close_" at a level that would force trades to close just after the fourth buy. When PA reached the "Close_" , trading stopped. Buys #1 and #3 closed and #2 and #4 did not close, but their stops readjusted by the Reduce_factor. I tried again, this time adjusting the "Close_" level to allow three trades. This time buys #1 and #3 closed and buy #2 did not close. Again I adjusted the "Close" level to allow only two trades. #1 buy closed and #2 did not. Is there a problem? Seems that the even number buys are not closing. Thanks for your attention. Regards.

I know this is a little off topic, but I am sure there is a smart person here somewhere that will know the answer.  
  
I have this problem with Windows XP, when I am running an EA on metatrader, during the week sometime, XP will automatically update itself from microsoft somehow, afterwhich shut it self down, and then re-start, but when it does that it kills metatrader, and then I have to start metatrader again with the EA.  
  
I looked in scheduler tasker in systems tools, and don't see this task or option, can someone please PM me if they have any idea how I can stop this function so when it downloads these updates it waits for a manual restart instead of a automatic one???

"does the "TS" change the "Stop Loss" in coordination with "Take Profit" and "TS trigger" ONLY as described in "FB EA Settings" YES, it does so only at the beginning of every 5 min if your "Chart_Time_Frame" variable is set at 5.  
  
You can see when the TS is turn on, the following way. When the TS is trig in accordance to your TS trigger, your trade will not have a T/P (Take profit) number under this col.

Your right Inquisitor, you have discover a bug with the Close_ function.  
Thanks to point it to me. I've fixed it but still need to validate the software.  
Version 1.5b will close only trades that are with an impair number, 1,3,5 if you have many trades open and you hit a trendline with "Close_" in it.  
  
Version 1.5c will fix this problem and i will improve the trailing stop feature as well in order to monitor trades in real time and not only at the beginning of every trading period as 1.5b does.  
  
Thanks for your patience.  
  
Best regards

Hi Samurai and ActionPl and all others,  
  
Not sure whether this has cropped-up somewhere else in this or other threads.   
  
The attached screen shots show my live trading using Vs 1-3B. "Short" trades initiate trades very quickly, and after closing of one, the next is initiated sometimes within 2 - 3 pips, whereas "Long" trades seem to take forever to enter trades. I think there is a logic error in the EA. Maybe I'm wrong?  
  
I have marked the start /end time blocks during the times i traded. No changes made to settings in long or short trades, only the driver to trade in the direction required. Also, no difference between currency pairs which is why I show results of 3 x pairs.   
  
I set the TP to 15 pips, with max orders 2, earlier trades with SL 300, later with SL 60, so as to quickly check my theory. Chart_Time_Frame = 5, MA_Length = 10, MA_timeframe = 10, Percent = 0.05, PipStep = 40.   
  
Have been testing Vs 1_5b concurrently on the demo system, same settings and this has the same flaw.   
  
Regards  
  
Andy

Hi AndyM-pips, i notice that you use MA_timeframe =10, you can not do that. Valid timeframe in Metatrader are   
1,5 , 15 , 30 ,60 , 240 .  
So if you use other than what it is shown above, you can't predict how this will work. Try with 15, you will see a much better responce.

Hi Andy, i've tried it with version 1.5b with your setup except for the MA_timeframe and that what i got from 8 june to 12 june on EURUSD:  
Chart_Time_Frame = 5, MA_Length = 10, MA_timeframe = **15** , Percent = 0.05, PipStep = 40.  
  
I have 17 win and the only lost is the last trade when the simulation stop.  
  
I think the setup for your MA_lengh was the source of your problem.

NONE, it's automatic (both directions). I just got stuck with v3.1a, so i started testing it with different settings. Currently I'm using the following for 3 weeks now:  
  
TrendAnalysis = True  
Manage Trade = True  
HAS_timeperiod = 240  
Chart_TimeFrame = 240  
MA_lenght = 10  
MA_timeframe = 1440

Hi,  
here the latest version with some bugs fix with the function that is closing your trade if you have "Close_" in your trendline description.   
Also, i had found a bug in the trailing stop function that prevent to follow an open trade the way it was described in the explanation. With this fix, i'm able to have better results by having the "TrailingStopFlag" set at true and have the parameters set to 200,200 for trailing stop and TStrigger as you will find in this version as default.   
Please test it to find parameters that you are confortable with before going life with this version.

Can someone please help me? I'm using MetaTrader platform and when I put a Trendline description as "Main_UpTrend_Alert_" it keeps dropping the "Alert_". Leaving it as "Main_UpTrend_".   
  
When I put my other Trendline description as "UpTrend_Close_Trade_Alert_" it keeps the full description. Anyone's help with this will be much appreciated.

I think you have trendline to close to price. That happens when price broke trendline. Try move trendline.

Thanks gasgas for your response. I tried moving "Main_DownTrend_Alert_" far away from current price, but it is still dropping "Alert_" from my description. Can't get it to work. Any other ideas?? I appreciate the help. Trying to learn.

Hi crt4x,  
Try placing the "Main_UpTrend_Alert_" below the current price action or   
"Main_DownTrend_Alert_" above the PA. If the "Main_DownTend_Alert_" line is below current price, the EA sees the trendline as being broken by the price. Trading stops and the "Alert_" is dropped from the trendline description. Hope this works.   
  
And thanks Actionpl for vs1.5c. Great work!![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Thanks Inquisitor for your kindness. That seems to work, but I'm a little confused. How is my "Main_UpTrend_Alert_" trendline going to ever trigger a Long trade if it is below the current price action. Sorry for my ignorance.

Hi ayoneeyee. I like your idea here. I'm a nubee trying to learn. Just curious did you take any trades today with this strategy? I tried it with your settings on v3.1a but it did not take any trades today. Would like to know so I can see if I did something wrong. Thanks.

My guess is that the EA generates Long trades while the PA remains above the trendline and conditions meet the requirements of the EA program. The EA will stop trades when the PA falls below the Main_UpTrend_Alert_ line. Hopefully this won't happen and prices will generate trailing stops to covserve profits. Good luck. Regards.

Outstanding ayoneeyee. I'll keep experimenting with this method. Curious, do you use the default settings for v3.1a, besides what you mentioned above? Thanks for your help and method.

Yes, I use default setting as specified on one of Samurai Power's previous post, execept that I set the Maxorderopen = 2 (this is to avoid unnecessary drawdowns). Also, you might want to check the percentage and usedivergence parameters. I think the default on the EA is different to what samurai parameter specified. My percent = 0.001 and usedivergence = 0.005, execept for USD/JPY - usedivergence=0.1.

Thanks guys for all your input. I just found this thread. It seems ver interesting. One small question. The version you guys are talking about, is this v3.1a or v1.3a? I understand that the latest one is v1.5c. Getting a little bit confused here.  
  
Thanks.

Hello everyone, i am a noob on this forum but not in forex trading. I have been following all the threads etc..Just a quick question to all, can you post some trades that you took today, the pairs and directions you drive it and how long normally after you get the confirmation with the heiken ashi candle color and emacrossover you start driving it? For example today june 24th the EURUSD it gave me a white heiken ashi candle confirmed with a white 5-8EMA cross..Is that enough to drive it long? Thanks again..also usdchf did you drive it short today june 24th? Are these valid trades? It would help many beginners if we start posting or driving directions with currency pairs dont you think? After all, i would love everyone to be successful and make a substantial amount of pips.

Hi,  
  
I've trailing stop flag set to true.  
Trailing stop 20  
TSrigger 20  
  
but it never kicks in when the trade gets over 20 pips ahead.  
  
Is there another setting I am missing?

I'm testing vs1.5c on a demo using the above settings and so far the trailing stop is working. It seems to activate when the price action approaches the profit point. I used default settings provided in this EA. After the trailing stop activates, you'll notice that the T/P figure is replaced by zeros. I had to increase DivergenceLimit to trade USD/JPY.  
Good luck. Regards.

Now thank you, really appreciate it.  
I'm going to test via VPS the automated EA with your settings, any trade-hours or other settings?  
  
Thanks again, lets make this work with real $.

Forgot to say, I'll still test the semiautomatic strategy. The fact that is the Ea is indicator based and market changes, so I think in the future we'll need to adjust the settings.  
  
We need someone that really knows how this EA works and tune it to react when market will change.

Yes, that is not acceptable however, it needs to activate by where it's setting tells it to be activated.

Hi guys, the rules is has follow.  
Assuming that you have set trailingstop at true:  
Initially, trail stop is not active.  
It will activate itself if PA make your profit bigger than value of TakeProfit minus value of TStrigger. The order will be modified if at the beginning of the next period of 5 min, your profit is still above your thresshold plus the slip value that you have setup. In any case the EA will monitor PA and if it fall below your TS, it will close the trade.  
You can see from your journal what happen. If you see Close, it mean that the price action had fall back below the TS excluding the slip value . If you see modify order, it mean that the EA was able to modify your order because you had enough profit to do it.  
  
Try it with the simulator with number of trade set at 1, you will see how it work. If you put number of trade greater than 1, it is not obvious to understand since i need to find a way to track many Trailing stop order live. For now it is working in most situation, but on some occasion the second and subsequent orders follows the max value setup by the first order. I will look to improve it so it can monitor each trade individually.  
Next version later this summer.  
  
Best of luck.

Thanks ayoneeyee for something to play with![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1), not bad settings for fully auto. Very good for shorter terms, but not so great in the long term i guess.

gasgas and TheGariel,  
  
The fact is, this EA is a top-performing EA, especially with so much work put into it by Actionpl and Samurai Power and I give them all the credit for it. I personally believe the best way to run this EA is to drive it manually if you know how to determine the direction of the Trend fast and accurately, actually, that is what i'm testing with the latest version (manual driving) and it's yielding good result.  
  
The only 2 reasons i'm testing the fully-auto and posting the result are;  
1) I'm not really a smaller TF trader - so I checked the bigger TF with the EA - i believe that could reduce the excessive drawdowns - if i'm monitoring the H4 and Daily TFs to determine my trend why can't I trade on it.  
  
2) I believe that if the result continues to be good and consistent, somebody like Actionpl and other talented programmers on this thread will take it from there and perfect it for higher TF traders like me.  
  
I actually don't know if running the EA fully auto will be good long term, but I know its been giving very good result for the past 3 weeks and very low draw down. I tried back-testing the last 2 weeks on a simulator but the result wasn't as good as the actual result i got on live trading (forward testing), so, i'm not going to completely rely on the result of a strategy tester, the best way to find out is to forward test it for sometime and compare it with your backtest result for that period. Also, very important, I don't actually run the EA continously like that, I close all left-over trades before the London market opens on Sunday, i don't care if they are lost trades (as long as I'm in profit already), and I don't activate the EA until the London market opens on Monday morning (2AM EST). I guess that might answer your question - TheGabriel.  
  
PS: I'm trading both the semi-auto and fully-auto on my live accounts now. it's been good. I'm not recommending anyone to do this until you've tested it and satisfied with the result.  
  
Ayo.

Thanks for the very detailed reply.  
You're doing exactly as me in testing, both semiautomatic and automatic trading.  
  
Made 300 pips in 2 days with the automatic version, max 2 trades at time, TP 30 and Trailing 15, no losses but I have to test it longer. I don't really trust backtesting with MT4.  
  
For the Semiautomatic system, I'm trading 4 pairs with have European Base currency during European session.

All I'm doing is using the default settings with the exception of the settings shown on ayoneeyee's post# 1667 (page 112). Good luck. [

I was in the same boat. I did find v3.1 in the fixed firebird thread, but no v3.1a. Also looked at the variables ayoneeyee has posted before. He mentioned the parameter "HAS_timeperiod" which is not available in v3.1. Then crt4x showed his profit using v1.3a. I decided t download that from this thread. And sure enough that had the parameter I mentioned. I just started trading with it, using the parameters discussed in the thread. Let's see what happens.  
  
Thanks.

The version I am using, 1.3a, can be found on page 80, post# 1200.

If the EA works best in consolidation periods, why not just use it outside the London/New York sessions?   
  
Just run it in the Asian session.

@Crt4x,Pillage,PotPlant,   
  
I don't want to get anybody confused about the version of the EA. The issue is, you can use any version of the EA you prefer, it's the same EA with the same code, infact the newer the version the better because Actionpl has taken the time to clean out some unnecessary codes in the latest versions, the only reason i'm using this version is because that's the first version I tried on my live account and made good money - you know, as they say, you don't change a wining team.   
Moreover,i'm kind of lazy, so adding all those multiple functions in the latest version is like work to me, I tend to be satisfied with just the trenline function (which I use on the semi-auto trading).  
  
Crt4x, great job ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1), keep the pips coming, that's an impressive result, maybe somebody will bring out more potential in this EA. This is one powerful EA that can be made perfect.  
  
Thanks to Samurai power and Actionpl for there great contributions to this community.

Divergence Limit 0.005   
also do you have the Use_V63D_Divergence set to true.  
What is your safe area?

What an EA and what a great concept!  
  
Thanks to everyone involved with this. I've just now found this thread and I've read through quite a bit of it. Very interesting stuff.  
  
ayoneeyee, could you please post a .set file so that we are all on the same page with your parameters?  
  
I've been having some trouble getting the EA to actually take trades and I'm sure I've got one of the settings wrong.  
  
Thanks,

Probably you haven't set the right timeframe parameters. Wha you must do is use the default settings and modify them as Ayoneeyee suggested.

Hi Every1  
Glad to see everyone is making still getting the greens with Firebird.  
Actionpl thanks for everything (appreciation goes to everyone as well for testing and continuous testing).  
Actionpl I will like to ask if you can help me modify the original FBv63 trader seven if you have the time.  
I will like to be able to put the EA on the daily chart and let it run on the 5mins (as in the case of the current version of FB you have posted) i.e. I can specify the Chart timeframe -(currently I have to open two charts for each pair)  
Thanks in anticipation  
My regards to all (SamP how is the baby?)

I put the original EA on the Eur/Usd and GBP/USD last night.  
  
EA places 2 SHORT Trades on the GBP/USD which both hit 100 TP.  
  
Excellent EA!!

I'm using the original version of the EA. I have disabled all alerts, but I still keep getting them to pop up. Is there any way to disable all sound in Alpari US?

![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1) Please, could anybody help me? All tested versions run smoothly except of one running with Fxcbs broker. No entries during many hours. Please, have a look at the chart and mention sentecies:  
invalid handle - 1 in File Close  
\- 1 in File Flush  
\- 1 in File Write  
\- 1 in File Seek  
... cannot open file...  
Maybe this is the reason of the silent FB ( vs 1.3a and 1.4a as well )?  
But why?? I checked settings and everything seems to be OK...  
  
By the way: many thanks to Samurai and Actionpl!! Great work!

Hi, you don't need to open two charts to do what you want. The EA is doing exactly what you want to do. If you open a chart on the 1hr basis, the EA will still trade on the 5min basis as long you have your parameter "Chart_Time_Frame=5"

Check if your parameter "writelog" is equal to 1. Set it to zero and let me know what happen.

Those message on left top corner are only there to give us some indcation of what is happening with the EA.  
Trade eanable: EA is ready to analyse the market since condition are met  
trade disable:: It meant that the EA will not trade due to filter parameters   
MarketAnalysis: The EA is checking the trend (if flag is on)  
Enterposition: The EA is analysing the actual situation to enter a trade. Most of time it will not open a new position. If all the conditions are met, it will open a trade.

Here's my statement, 1 week 1200 pips with 8 pairs (you see only 1000 pips for old trades in the attachment), no loss so far.  
  
You guys had losses?

All along I kept saying I'm using Firebird_3.1a, i was looking through my chart today and I found out it was version 1.3a. All along i kept placing the 3 before the 1 - I guess it must have been too much excitement that clouded my eyes - All I can say is i'm sorry if I got you confused with this - that was my bad.  
  
That said, it's still a wonderful system making greens - this week 15+ winning trades, no loss so far. So no matter the version you use, its the same Firebird. I was a bit worried about the NFP, but it does very well with NFP - that was amazing.  
  
TheGabriel - Wow!, excellent result - I noticed your SL and TP are both 300. What settings are you using?. You must be using a broker that allows hedging to get those amazing result.  
  
YES. This EA uses Hedging as one of it's strategy for trading - I compared my results of 2 accounts -IBFX and [FxPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") \- FxPro does very well with the EA because it allows hedging, but IBFX does not.  
  
**My greatest concern now is the new FIFO rule - no more SL or Limit order (TakeProfit) by July 31st. I don't know if ActionPl can do something for us here - HELP Please!!!.**

It's a 30 pips take profit and a 300 pips SL (I know is not that good) with FxPro, I think that leave the take profit as 100 pip is too much and risky, with a 300 pips SL and trying to catch the trade on 4H (all done by the ea) I'll be able to get a trend of 30 pips in my direction.  
  
I'm testing, I'll increase value on demo and trade with this settings live. I'm sure most of the time I leave at least 10-20 pips on table before the trend does change direction again for the next hours, but I like it this way. Beeing greedy didn't work for me. I'm using your settings ayoneeyee.  
  
About the FIFO rule you can use an EA that uses internal stop loss and take profit.

You need to trace a trendline and give it a description with Main in it.  
Ex. Main_UpTrend_Alert_  
Pay attention to capital letter and the _ otherwise the EA will not recognize it.

hi this is proof of full auto in ea   
I wondered if it would have to operate well or not   
eg realistic sales above the 83 MA and REALIZE purchases below the 83 MA is this correct?  
  
sorry for my bad english. thanks you¡¡¡¡¡¡¡

Version 1.5c is not executing trades.   
  
"Waiting for main trend" msg is displayed.   
  
Could you please have a look at the code?  
  
Thanks a million

Actionpl - thanks for your reply!  
But my demos at Fxcbs and [FXCM](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") ( both 5 digits brokers with my proper settings to that) have no entries so far even with writelog=1 or =0 .  
My another demo ( 4 digits XTB brokers ) is running smoothly - all versions of the FB ( writelog=1).  
Never mind, I keep testing on the XTB.  
Good luck to you!

Been away for awhile, but now I'm back on this thread, soaking everything up like a sponge. My question is what are people doing on Fridays? Are you closing all open orders before the weekend starts?  
  
Thanks,

many thanks to samuraipower & actionpl & all of you who have contributed to it!!  
  
i've been day-trading forex in manual way & been quite profitable. The problem is 'time-consuming', plus i still have to manage my stocks & future positions, i really exhausted. i've been trying to build a fully auto ea with all kind of ideas, but still cant find a way to make it positive expectancy in the simulation from 2005, problem is chart pattern recognition is really an art that machine cant understand.  
  
firebird ea works similar to some swing technique which trade during retracement in the major trend, idea that am comfortable with. plus now i can use my chart pattern knowledge to tell the machine when to start & when to stop, and the good thing is i dont have to sit in front of monitor for few hours per day, just to get few ten Rs per month.  
  
thanks!!

Thanks ActionPL for your help.   
  
I have concerns about the risk of this system.   
  
It has a large SL @ 300 pips and opens 5 positions when the market is going against us. Then it hedges those positions. If we are trading 8 pairs the worst case scenario is we have a total of 40 positions open. If the market moves against us (trend change) we could conceivably be in very large drawdown and even margin call. The question then has to be asked, what is our total overall risk to our account (VaR)? I don't think this issue has been adequately addressed? Since we are going down the automated route, perhaps a coder could implement an advanced money management routine to allow the trader to control risk more effectively. I for one think this is a great system but we need to prepare for the worst should it occur.   
  
Any thoughts?  
  
Cheers

Hi,  
  
I'll do these things to control the risk:  
1\. position size properly to have lotsize number such that 300pips stop is only 1R risk (my 1R is 3% of my total capital)  
2\. set MaxOpenOrders to 2-3, i see this still yield good result in my backtest  
3\. use Main_*Trend_Alert_ rather than *_Trade_Alert_ which will not open reverse position when trendline broken  
4\. use default Reduce_factor=2, it'll cut the stoploss by half when trendline broken. thus, if you have 2 open orders and the trend reverse, the total risk will be lower down to 1R rather than 2R originally

Hi actionpl,  
  
I have 2 questions regarding trendline control:  
  
1\. Let say i want the EA starts to take trade when it breaks the equilateral triangle (using trendline watch feature), should i put "Main_UpTrend_Alert" & "Main_DownTrend_Alert" trendlines together? But i read from the manual that we should put only 1 "Main" trendline.  
  
2\. I only want to trade short, so i have put a "Main_DownTrend_Alert_" trendline. but i want it to start trading only when it breaks certain line. so i put another line as "DownTrend_Alert_" and enable the trendline_watch function. will it work?  
  
Many thanks ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

With the Firebird Automatic v1.3a what happens at trend change? Does the EA close open positions and reverse or just let them float to p/l based on firebird?

Question #1: The EA will not work reliably with two Main_*Trend_Alert_  
So, will not do what you are looking for.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1) This could be a good idea to implement. I will look if it can be implemented easily.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Question#2: Your setup is OK, the EA have been design to do just that with variable TrendLine_watch = true![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) Once the DownTrendline will be hit, the system will start to trade in the direction of the Main trend line.

The EA will stop openning new trades and will use the Stop lost to close your trade if hit.  
  
You need to switch to version 1.4a if you want the EA to close trades when price action hit your trend line. To activate this automatic close fonction, you need to insert Close_ in the description. Ex. UpTrend_Close_Alert_

The new rules will prevent us to have two open positions buy and sell at the end of the day. So, you can't use the Option Trade_ in your description. (For version 1.4a and up)  
The FIFO rule will in fact restrict us to have only one trade open at a given time. So we will need to set variable MaxOpenOrder = 1.   
I did not see any reference that will prevent us to use Stop Lost or Take Profit.   
If you have some information about that, please send me the link.  
  
We will need to find a new setup that will produce good results with those constraints.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Is it possible to modify the EA so that the second trade lot size is slightly different (e.g. .100 first trade and .101 for the second trade) so that it complies with the new rule and won't be subject to FIFO? I guess this has to be researched. Thanks. Regards.

I was thinking about same thing althou i too am not sure if this is the 100% sure solution. But in any case it would be great if each trade could be user defined.   
  
PS. This thread is really interesting, im going to try to catch up on it in next few days.

Why do you not have a T/P on all orders that have hit Trailing S/L  
Your T/P is 0.000.  
Is this a bug in the EA ?  
  
Still good results but hard to say if you would have ever hit a T/P as there was never one to hit, if there was a set T/P then your profit probably would have been even better rather than stopping out on a stop loss

Yes, you are absolutelly right, I could have had better results, I know that, but we alltogether must improve the basic settings of the FB! This is my fourth step... I think I will cancell the Stoploss, who knows? I go on testing..

Hi,  
I'm working on version 1.5d that do exactly what you refer to. This new version will allow us to have stop loss and still keep the takeprofit option.  
I will make it so that we can turn this option on or off.   
  
I am also working on a new stoploss option that will adjust itself dynamically to the market conditions. I still have some bugs in it but the initial results seem pretty encouraging. This will also be an alternative to trade with the new Forex rules starting in August.  
  
I will post it when the code will be stable.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Don't have a lot of time to work on that for now.

Yes you need label trendline with trendline_watch=false or true.  
  
If you don't want to trace trendline, you need to set variable TrendAnalysis=false.  
  
In the past we have test it and it does not produce consistant good results over a long period of time. If you find a set of variable that is working in different market condition, let us know.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Of course: FB 1.C standard settings with exception: TP:50, Trigger:20,   
TS true:20, both trendlines MDTA and MUTA are together in the same chart ( I haven't had any problem with this so far...). I don't think this is the optimal setting and trying another ones.

ActionPL  
  
Are you saying that by not using trend analysis (trendline) that the EA does not perform well?   
  
How long did you test for?   
  
Thanks

Hi all  
Unfortunately it's impossible to backtester this EA with trendanalysis=true.  
Here is the results 2009 with trendanalysis=false.  
So we have to use the EA with trendanalysis=true to perform.

Is trendanalysis set to false for you? If it's not, then do you draw the trend line for each graph manually?  
  
Those who are getting all wins with little losses and are using fully automated strategy... you must be using trendanalysis set to false? Otherwise you have to draw a maintrend line and it is semi automatic in that case. Which is the case?   
  
TheGabriel or ayoneeyee care to explain?  
  
Gasgas said it's best to use during sideways trend, so should limit  
the ea's time to the Asian time session?

I think you are right gasgas. From my experience last week, when the market was trending, the EA did not perform as well as when the market is consolidating. Semi-auto trading will be good for trending market.

I wanted to backtester only the Asian session with trendanalysis false.  
Unfortunately it's impossible : I'm thinking the open and close hours of the EA are not working correctly.

Well the only loss i hav was on GBP-USD and that day all the trades together for this pair with loss too, It still have been profitable for a few pips. For that day yes the loss canceled the profits. I will probably raise the TP to at least 50 pips, but the trailing doesn't seem to work.

Gabriel, your results are impressive, however i cannot seem to duplicate those stats. Are you using version 1.3a and please re-post your settings. Cheers!! Also, do you just start the Ea at the open of the next day, and let run for the duration, or do you turn on the Ea at the London/and or US open?

I use the same settings [ayoneeyee](http://www.forexfactory.com/member.php?u=81685) shared posts ago, except made for take profit and sl wich is now 40 pips as TP and 300 as SL for me.  
  
I'll have to test and see how it goes, we still have to face a trending market.

An update for the automatic EA guys, I'm getting back to semiautomatic, will continue to test full automatic EA but it works good for ranging markets, not trending ones, so we must make it work the semiautomatic way anyway.  
  
**I'd like to know how gasgas or samuraipower are doing, are you guys on?** And any other friends doing it semiautomatic, real or demo trading, please specify too.

I think it's a good way, right now i just disable the ea and don't let it trade when I can't find the trade for the day (the semiautomatic way). Maybe I'll try to find the day trade and when I'm not able and seems in range I'll let it trade both long and short.  
  
I'll let you know the results. For the semiautomatic way I'll set 50 PIPS TP, the automatic way 30 PIPS.  
  
Any further ideas? I've set the Ea to trade from 8 to 21 as open and close hours, you other guys are just doing default with 0-24?

I have noitced this EA a while ago and it looks like a great thing! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
Unfortunately, i never managed to try it and I don't understant why it doesn't work.  
  
I opened a demo account on [fxpro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") with a 1000$. Then i have downloaded Firebird-v63H04_Heiken_Ashi_Trend_vs1_3b. All the settings are from this post: [http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2714301&postcount=1280  
](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=2714301&postcount=1280)  
What I have changed is:  
Lots: 0.01  
  
Maybe I should change something else because the EA doesn't open any position at all and I even can't backtest it because it shows no results. I've tried to backtest it like it says in the first post (maybe second) but still 0 opened positions. Can somebody help me??  
  
P.S. English is not my default language, so sorry if it is confusing ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

i found these in the doc in this thread "Instructions for Setting Up and Operating Firebird - June 1 2009.doc"  
  
so if i want to have the EA start trading long on a break of a horizontal trendline (resistance) when in a range i would use #???   
  
i tried various combinations below in strategy tester but, i ended up with buys and sells opening in the test when i only wanted long. i had trendline_watch=true. should trendanalysis be on too by the way for a scenario where i only wanted to initiate trading on the break of a trendline? i tried first with it on and it wouldn't open any trades in this scenario so i turned it off and it started trading but, i got some sell trades when i didn't want any.  
  
i'm using v 1.5c  
  
it would be helpful if there was a quality document created and maintained that covered the evolving trendline syntax and trade examples. i have seen A LOT of people having to ask these specific questions.  
  
thanks for all the generosity in sharing.

I don't think [FX Pro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile") allows micro lots. The smallest lot size you can use with them is .10  
  
Hope this helps,

That's right, you should have seen errors in MT4 because of the lot size.

Hi Gabriel, you need to use version 1.5c in order to have the trailling stop fonction work correctly. I still have to improve the trailling stop fonction when you have more than 1 order open. But 1.5c will work much better than the previous version.  
  
Try it.

See my answer at post 1749 to enable the ea to wait for a trendline break before it will start to trade. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

I did some more research on this new rules. Here the link to read the new rules. Go at the end of this report. <http://forex-systems-reviews.com/NFAreport.pdf>. This report will also gave you a list of brokers with their responce to those new rules. __**A MUST TO READ  
  
**__As you can see, Stoploss and Take profit will still work.   
Edging will not work from day to day but will work on a given day.  
FIFO rule will prevent us to have multiple order with the same lot size. So this mean that with version 1.5c and earlier, you will need to set variable   
MaxOpenOrders=1 if you want to follow this rule.  
  
There is a way to get around that, it is to have lot size change for eah trade. I will have to change the EA so it will change the lot size by an increment that you will specify each time a trade is open. This way, we will not go agains the FIFO rules starting the 1 of August. So the first trade will be at 0.1 lot, the second trade will be at 0.11 lot and so on.(If the increment is 0.01 and if your broker accept microlot). I will have the EA customize in such a way that people will be able to select the initial lot size as we have now and the increment. So you will be able to customize it to your broker requirement.  
  
I can't guarantee that this will be ready for the 1st of August since it required change to the code and i will be in vacation.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1) So next version will have this feature and the improvement on trailling stop fonction as described last week.

I think to have a better risk managemend we should include in the EA code, the strategy of scaling in and out of positions, basically let's say we have this situation:  
  
**1)** We open a trade of 0,3 lots with tp of 90 pips.  
**2)** At +30 pips the robots closes 0,1 of the position and moves the take profit to breakeven.  
**3)** At +60 pips the robots closes the other 0,1 of the position and if the price goes to +90 pips we're out with a total of 180 pips with 0,1 lotsize, if not it will go to the stoploss wich is at breakeven and we don't lose a penny and we get 90 pips with 0,1 lot size.  
  
If you don't get it, [see here](http://blogs.fxstreet.com/fxpath/2009/07/17/scaling-in-and-scaling-out/)  
  
There already are some ea that do this but we can attach 2 eas on the same chart so we have to include it in the code or have 2 MT4 opened for the same account with the 2 eas attached.

This will be greatly appreciated. One other thing is if you can add an option that makes the TP and SL hidden, it will be nice, some brokers hunt down SL.

It's because i've tested the automatic EA for less than 1 month, this means that there still are possibilities for me to have losses and having a SL of 300 pips and TP of 30, it means I'll instantly blow up 10 winning trades. With the profits I have right now, if I get 10 STOP LOSSES wich is possible as it opens many trades at time, i lose the profits of a month.  
  
This EA is a risky environment if it's not profitable for long, and you need a big account to trade with this stop loss.

I am testing the same strategy ( or settings ) as you have tried according to ayoneejee, but I am getting better results with the "original" settings of the FB 1.5c ( I know they are NOT according to the first Firebird philosophy! ). Please, find my prevoius post. I must say that my settings are a little bit tweaked ( 5digits: TP:500, SL:1200, TS:200, Trigger:200, PipStep 1 million ). I would say that your settings MUST be more succesfull ( TF 240 instead of the 5, etc ). But according to my tests they are not. So far. I am surprised: H4 strategy should be more reliable I think.   
Yes, my ( forward demo and real ) tests are only running for 2 weeks and that is nothing. Let's keep going on..... Keep us informed, please. So let do the others. I will post my findings as well.  
Bye!

I think my settings (they're the one on TF 4h yes) are working just because I'm using a big SL of 300 pips as someone already said.  
  
Out of about 100 trades there's only one loss but this month we've seen markets in ranges, not trending one so I'm about 70% sure there are big losses to come. I think the key still is to be able to identify the trade for the day and let it do semiautomatic on 5M TF.  
  
I don't suggest you to run it live, I've had a trade live going on that was opened 2 weeks ago!

Sorry about your margin call, i've lost more than that in Forex and I'm still here, so don't give up.   
  
What was your SL/TP levels and how many trades you had opened all together?  
With 3 pairs you can only have 3 trades at time, so pipstep (99999...) and Max Trades 1, GBP USD is a risky pair too.  
  
Let others know your settings if you want so we can see what was wrong. You did first test it for a few weeks at least?

Do you mean you had an account with $900 (or lbs)? If so, the lot size of .1 seems very large. With that size of an account I wouldn't have a lot size bigger than .02.   
Take your lot size and multiply it by your SL and the number of open positions and see if you can handle that kind of a loss. It is not that it CAN happen but that it WILL happen at some point. It doesn't matter how profitable a system is, you can't pocket money from an account that has been wiped out.   
  
I like the profits I am seeing but the size of the SL required is scaring me off from a live account.  
  
Hey TheGabriel, I see you removed the link to your account. It was looking hot for a while but last I saw it was heading into some serious drawdown. Has it been that far down before?

Actually I had only one loss out of 104-6 trades: <http://fxprogabriel.mt4live.com/> It's positive for 3300 pips in 1 month of testing. We've been in ranges this month, this is why i think it worked very very well. I have to see a big trande like an uptrend that lasts for long, but i think we can work it out doing it semiautomatically. However is very likely that the EA would already have some opened trades before you see the big picture.  
  
But I'm removing the link because I won't share the settings unless I find them safe for at least 2 months, as you've seen is quite easy to blow your account with this EA.

This is my first post on FX factory, mostly because I didnt feel I had enough forex knowlege until now to make an edjucated post.  
  
Anyways here it goes... I have been up and down this thread expermenting with different settings for the multiple Firebird EA's that are available. I have been using a strategy utilizing these systems on a live account for about a month now and has shown to be profitable. I know a month is short term however I have a good reason to believe the strategy will work for long term as well.  
  
The strategy utilizes both full auto and semi driven firebirds.   
As TheGabriel has mentioned the full auto system works very well on a ranging market but not trending.  
So I have been trading 8 currencies at a time (the number of charts works well in a verticle sortment on MT4) and placing the fully auto firebird on only markets that are ranging, and then placing the semi auto firebird on the markets that are trending.  
  
My results have been very pleasing. I have about 85% win rate and all my losses occured with the trending market which I have the semi auto version running which reduces S/L to 150 pips. Also my gains in the trending markets have been higher due to trailing S/L.  
  
Now, I understand that the system can draw down your account and cause margin call, however if that happens it is most likely due to poor money management. Such as the above post having $900 and working with .1 (mini) lots. With that high of a risk he only needed 3 losses on the full auto ea and his account is vanished! 3 losses!!! IMO that is not good money management. I have been trading micro .01 lots and will increase the lot size by .01 every $200-$300 made. This way before I even reach the mini lot size I will have close to $5,000 in the account.  
  
I am not an experienced trader (only about 3 months experience) but I do know good money management and I do know a good system when i see one and i believe this is it, I just hope it works long term.  
  
Thats just my .02 cents

The problem in my opinion is to disable the EA when you see it gets out of range, because you'll already be in some trades that will hit SL. And in my case it came near the SL.

FXDD is a market maker, however, that is what i am currently using.  
  
I am talking a true MT4 ECN broker like PFG or MBtrading who takes commissions and truly has no deal desk.  
  
I am just afraid that if my profits keep rising I will start seeing some stop hunting, and with true ECN and no deal desk thats not possible.

Gabriel,  
Do you think there may be a way to code into the EA to allow 2 horizontal trend lines that you could put near the support and resistance of a ranging market, and have your stops divided by 2 or whatever variable you choose?  
  
This way if the market breaks free of its range your losses will be cut significantly.  
  
I suppose this would not be fully auto though... what about bollinger bands? could the trade be cut if the market touches the top or bottom of the bands?

That makes sense. If the S/R lines are crossed then the EA would shut down and close trades on that chart.

Actually there's the trendline function in the EA that Actionpl coded if I'm right, I haven't used it but I'll try it and understand how it works.  
  
I suggest you guys to also work on your manual strategy as backup if the EAs fail, you never now and can't totally rely on a robot, at least make a portfolio of EAs, but manual is still good.

You are right on both counts.   
  
  
I think the trendline function works backwards to this though. I think I enters when the trendline is broken rather than shut down.  
  
  
I agree that EA's are prone to fail. But if it is mixed with manual discretion it should do wonders. I mean that it would enter at optimum times rather than waiting for me to get out of the shower or second guess myself. But it should be shut down or directed as a manual system.

If I have an open trade and the MT4 closes for any reason, once restarted, does the EA recognize that open trade or does it start from the beginning as if no trades are in the system? Thanks. Regards.

It recognizes the trade as they have magic numbers.

If we could put the stochastic divergence (daily) in the firebird code, to check overbought and oversold levels, the EA could decide by itself the daily trend and set it as buy or sell.  
  
This would be a full auto EA. Stochastic Divergence on daily is powerful, even on 4H it is.  
  
I'm not a coder so I can't do it, if everyone is willing to add the stochastic divergence check is everything we need. And we could cut this SL at half i think, 300 pips is too much.  
Let's make this happen.

Right now FB uses Heiken Ashi(HA) to determine the trend on the H4 timeframe (240) by your settings. This would cause SL's when the trend changes. Are you proposing using the Stochastic Divergence to try to find when it is overbought/sold so that it determines that the trend is going to change before the HA can?  
  
To cut SL's we can try to do two things, one to cut out losses when the HA trend changes (probably less than 300 pips). Or secondly try to add the Stoch indicator to see when it is overbought or oversold to cut our loss then (probably less than 300) or try both.   
  
I need to know what exit rules to follow using the Stoch. Indicator as I haven't used it before. I can code it in.  
  
Again this is trying to automate a process that a professional would do by driving this EA semi-automatic with trend lines to define the entry/exit points of a trend. You can use trendlines to exit your trades, as well as enter.

£900 GBP is Pounds £ not lbs, that is weight ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1), Yes it was £ pounds which equal to about $1500 USD, 0.1 lots is still $1 per pip even though my balance was in pounds, its not £1 per pip.  
  
0.1 lot size was the very minimum i could use with my broker.  
  
Oh well nevermind it was money i could aford to loose and the fault was my own for not setting the EA to less than 5 max orders.  
  
All i can say is that i will learn from my mistake and maybe come out the good side with my next deposit.

I don't like the heiken hashi candles very much as they are lagging, you see the changed trend always later.  
  
**TF= 4H (240)**  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1248380166](http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=277785&stc=1&d=1248380166)  
  
  
**The logic behind the entry points:**  
**1)** If level is under 30, only buy.  
**2)** If level is over 70, only sell.  
**3)** If level is between 50-70 or 30-50 follow the stochastic cross direction.  
  
As exit point, this would mean a dinamic take profit right? This would mean a whole different strategy**.  
  
**I have one in mind wich with _**tp/sl = 1**_ would give winning trades of **over 90%** **(** i still have to lose one trade in manual trading and with 3 currencies makes 180 pips a day sometime**)** , but that's a different strategy wich provides 1 or maximum 2 trades a day per currency and would work only with GBP/JPY, GBP/USD and EUR/GBP as they move a lot...i think would work with even others if tp is not that 60-90 pips as average...maybe about 40 pips.  
  
Lets make firebird work at least because it can be very profitable, if you want we can work on my EA wich very simple and solid logic behind (still cross on 50 line but other indicators).

I have also found a Stoch Div on another forum along with a EA that uses it... maybe someone can utilize some of this code.

Your correct, I backtested it and it performed poor... I just figured someone could possibly use some of the code to make things easier

**For everyone who is willing to do it automatically, let's set a goal:**  
  
Make this EA workw with**risk/reward of 1** , having the same number of pips as TP and SL, if we can do it this way, with small take/profit and s/l: it would be a good EA. It's too easy to keep positions for long praying God we're in range markets.  
  
As predicted, in my statement losses are showing up, so I had a point when I didn't want to share the settings and ruin some newbie live account:

Actually it would be better to have even a bigger tp than sl but with this EA I don't think is a possible scenario.  
  
Banks have thousands of traders doing manual trading, they invest millions in developing systems for manual trading so there's evident that EAs tend to fail over time and we can't rely on them.  
  
What we can do is have a good money management in our EA and at least try to get a 60% winning rate with 1:1 risk/reward, or have even a lower risk/reward with the same rate of success, that would mean more money.  
**  
Do someone think we can make this EA enter on the direction of the trade and manage to get some fast 10-15 pips, without having a big retracement so we can keep the SL small?  
  
  
**

I have a ? about the semi-auto version.  
  
If I can hypothetically always correctly determine the direction of trend (using a method of my own) it should be consistently profitable over time, unlike the fully auto version correct?

It stands to reason. Of course if I always correctly determine which way the market is going I can just place a trade, remove all s/l and wait.

Thanks for your advice. Please can you share your setting for trailing stop? I want to test version 1.5c but the Ts did not work. Maybe I am missing something on the setting. Please help me someone. Regards, markpips.

Yea, haha guess I didn't realize what I was asking. Sometimes you get so involved in analysis and EAs that you lose a bit of common sense.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1)

Hi ayoneeyee and others, try this version, it has many new features and some bugs fix.  
  
New features:   
1- Will change the trade size by what is in variable "Lots_Increment" each time a new trade is activated while having a trade open. This will allow us to go around the FIFO rule.  
2- Allow to have hidden profit and hidden stoploss when variable "TrailingStopFlag" is true. Lood at variable "Hidden_Take_Profit". To desactivate Hidden profit, set this variable larger than the TakeProfit variable. To activate the hidden stop lost, you need to have profit larger than "TakeProfit-TStrigger". So if your TakeProfit is at 1000, set your TStrigger at 1010. This way your hidden stoplost will be what you have set in variable TrailingStop as soon the trade is open.  
3- A new dynamic trailingStop feature have been added. If you want your trailing stop to be the previous low from time frame set by variable "Auto_Chart_time" which is lower than the (acual Bid - TrailingStop_margin) for a buy, set variable TrailingStopDynamic at true  
4- Now the EA will take track of individual trailingStop for a given pair even if you have many trade open on the same pair.  
5- Fix bugs in trailingStop fonction  
6- For those who are using the TrendLine_watch = true, The EA will automatically place a Main_XTrend_Alert_ when price action will touch either an UpTrend_Alert_ or a DownTrend_Alert_. So on a flat market, you can place a UpTrend_Alert_ under the lows and a DownTrend_Alert_ above the trading range and when price action will hit the UpTrend_Alert_ trend line, it will trace a Main_Down_Alert_ above the last high of the time frame set by variable "Auto_Chart_time". And the opposite if it hit the DownTrend. Whith this fonction you can set your EA to monitor the market and start trade when conditions are met.  
  
Try this version and let me know how it work. Make sure your trade on demo with this version before you go live. This have many tool in the tool boxe to set up your trades. So you need to experiment and get confident with it before doing any life trade.  
  
Best regards

Many thanks for these improvements.  
I'm confused with the section TrendAnalysis and the section Autotrade.  
So if we consider the market flat, you suggest in Autotrade Section to set Manage_Trade = true and in TrendAnalysis Section to set TrendLine_Watch = true and TrendAnalysis = false.  
Correct ?  
Now if we put the features of your # 6 post 1828 ( UpTrend_Alert_ , DownTrend_Alert_ etc etc ) , the EA starts trading when conditions are met ie when the market becomes trendy.  
But in this case , the setting of TrendAnalysis is false.  
Will the EA work correctly ?  
It would be well to resume the different possibilities of EA settings according to the situations of market ( choppy or trendy )  
Because there are now a lot of good settings and I fear little that many traders are a bit lost.  
Best regards.

Here is the Demark Indy to help you to determine the trend.  
Actionpl , do you see a possibility to integrate this indy as a main trendline to realize a full auto working ?  
Thx.

Hi all,  
  
I have been reading this thread, and finally reached the last page.  
I have downloaded several versions and docs about the Firebird versions tested here and mainlly for the SamurayPower manual dircetion strategy.  
  
Now I have 2 questions:  
What is the used automatic version? I read about the 3.1a (which I did not found), the 1.5d version, and all other here... advice please?  
  
Regardless the semi-automatic version, SamuraiP do you still using the Firebird v63G trader seven?  
  
Thank you all and keep the good work

By the way...  
I think that this indi can be usefull. Tested and do not repaint. It's a great tool for optimizing the entry and/or exit points

Hi there,  
  
I have been backtesting several automated versions of Firebird posted here, and all of them gives me an error = 130 (on modifying and open some orders).  
  
The backtests I am making are on a broker (FxOpen) that just allow me to open positions on 0.1lots interval. Could this be the reason?  
  
I have tested on a broker that allows 0.01 steps and works fine...  
  
I have checked and it is not caused by 4/5 digits broker (tried both options).  
  
Regards  
  
Paulo

So if we consider the market flat, you suggest in Autotrade Section to set Manage_Trade = true and in TrendAnalysis Section to set TrendLine_Watch = true and TrendAnalysis = false.  
Manage_Trade is only a flag to prevent the EA to trade agains Heiken Ashi indicator. This indicator is working well with trend. On trendless period, you are going to get hit with badtrade.  
TrendLine_Watch flag is to set the EA in a mode to detect when to start trade. So in trendless period, you set this flag at true and place an UpTrend_Alert and a DownTrend_Alert so when price action hit one of those, it will start to trade in the direction that the market want to go. So your skill of how to place those trendline are very important.  
So if you combine both of those flag and your are right to detect a trend, it will produce good results.

There is no automatic version that have been demonstrade to work consistantly. This EA is for semi automatic. It his a lot of tools to held you trade forex market. So you need to detect which way the market will go and place Main trendline accordingly.  
  
Version 3.1a nerver existed. It was a typing mistake. When you see 3.1a it meant 1.3a. I do not recommend to use those old version. They have bug in it. Use version 1.5d.

When you see those message, there is a number with it. This is the value of the divergence or the SaveArea. Change it so it will be higher than those number and it should work.  
  
Being on a 4 digit broker, you need to divide by 10 a lot of those variables  
Takeprofit, stoploss, Safearea, .... Any variable that refer to the value of the trade.  
  
Read previous post on this subject, you will have some more info.

Make sure that your variable "Lots" is equal to 0.1 or higher and also that your variable lots increment is equal or higher than 0.1. And it has to be in multiple of 0.1 lot. (version 1.5d)

If this indicator do efficiently what you say it does, that will be great. But we will need to change also the logic of how we enter the first trade.  
  
I will look at hit when i came back from vacation and see. If you can do some simulation with it and send me your results it will be great.   
Before i spend many hours to change the code, i need to have a good confidence level that this will work.  
  
Let me know the results of your evaluation

From an earlier post............Use "long and short" option only in ranging market - it will eventually trigger your stop losses if you leave it to run unattended, therefore kill it when you think the PA is starting to trend.

Hi to all, there was a last minute bug inserted in the code when i did a last minutes change. Please reload version 1.5d i have corrected the code.  
Message with saverarea being too low even when variable was set to a high number will not appear anymore. Also you can program your EA to trade for different hours now. I have verify the code, corrected and it work. Make sure to enter the server timeframe on which you want to trade in variable TradeFrom and TradeUntill. The EA will trade including the hour set in the TradeUntill variable.  
  
Bye

Thx Actionpl  
Now EA is working fine.  
About Demark_trend, I'm not thinking you need to code again.  
This indy is a tool.  
The pic shows a uptrend channel (blue) which is broken.  
So we can consider a new downtrend and we draw a Main_DownTrend line to take only short trades.  
I'm waiting for your explanations because I didn't understand how the trade exactly is triggered ( SMA broken in M5 , in M15 ????)  
Why by default a Chart_Time_Frame in M5 and a MA_timeframe in M15 ?  
Regards.

Hi Madscalp, the Ma_timeframe is used in the calculation of the pullback. This is used in conjonction with variable percent. So if you want to play with it to find a better setup go for it. You need to used a valid time frame, 15, 60, 240,. You may change those to change the way the EA will trigger an entry point. If you used a shorter time frame, it will react more rapidly. This need to be explore now that we have those main trendline. So at the beginning of a trend, we may want to reduce this to 5 in order to trig a trade more rapidly and benefic from the new trend. Please report your finding if you explore this.  
  
Thanks

Thank you markpips for reviving the thread. Question to anyone...I'm using vs 1.5d on a demo with default settings. The ea seems to close a position before a sl or tp is reached. Could it be that the Heiken Ashi setting of 60 causes this to happen? Regards.

Nice that you are back Inquistor.  
I have not tested version 5d. because I was away from trading for about a month now. I hope other guys will chip in answers to your question.  
Thanks for your post. Posting will encourage the master coder Actionpl to spend more of his time.  
Keep piping everybody.

Hi Inquisitor, version 1.5d have a variable that allow to have profit taken which is hidden from broker. Check this variable "Hidden_TakeProfit" in section Trailing Stop. P.S. you need to activate trailing stop in order to have this feature to take effect.  
  
Also the default setup have trailing stop activated and the dynamic trailing stop activated. This feature will change the trailling stop to the previous bar low or high. This is a good feature for pair with high volatility. If you don't want that feature, set variable "TrailingStopDynamic" to false.  
  
P.S. I will have to release a new version to fix a small bug with functionnality of Hidden profit in case of sell order. Hidden profit does not work for sell order in vesrsion 1.5d.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f61e.png?v=15.1) I forgot a line of code....

Hi ActionPL,  
  
Have not as yet tested FB Vs_5d. Been running Vs_5c live for quite a while, doing v well with it. But, collected a real clanger this week using it.  
  
In 3 seconds, it opened and closed 21 trades with an average loss of 4 pips each = 81 pips.  
  
Started with me testing the trailing stop function (1st time I used it) so I fortunately used the minimum lot size (thank goodness!). Currency was GU, spread 4 pips.  
  
The UpTrend Trade started OK, went into good profit, then reversed, I figured it would go into loss. I then made a mistake which I think was the cause of the problem. I created a new "Main_UpTrend_Alert_05" trend-line, while the first trade was still running and active. The trade re-traced, went to -18 pips, which was the value in the SL (from the trailing stop function) and closed the trade on -18pips. Then it all went wrong; it immediately opened a new trade, saw it was below the previous Trailing stop point, and closed it immediately - 3 pips loss! And again, 5pip loss and again and again, 21 times in 3 seconds. Fortunately, I returned to the PC as this happened, else it could have been a real disaster!   
  
Will be great if you can close this gap in the EA in case a similar error is made by someone else. Same may apply to Vs1_5d?  
  
I have been using Vs1_5c in its basic semiauto form, with simple rules, and tight trend lines so that I can bail-out with minimum losses. Only used in very trending conditions.  
  
Have been using Vs1_3b when market ranges, will post settings used in another post.  
  
Bye

Hi everyone,  
  
For those interested in using this EA as fully automatic, when the Vs1_5c is not suitable.  
  
Using this live. I have not made big profits, I'm happy if I get 20-25 pips/day - I think the secret is in defining when straight-lining /ranging starts and ends. I keep getting it wrong!  
  
Use Vs 1_3b only when "straight-lining", and set to trade both "long & short" - NOT during trends, which will clean you out. Therefore, you need to also "drive" 3b but in a different way compared to 5c and 5d where you use trend-lines. I use it on a 5 min chart. Only use when trends dissappear - check the PA - put MA 10, MA 21, MA 50 on your chart, and when they criss-cross often then switch the EA ON. Soon as they split-up and start moving out of the trade price range area that you assess as suitable for trading the EA, then you switch the EA OFF. Once OFF, I trade manually - when conditions right, the Philip Nel 5M Intra-day System with the above MA 10, 21 and 50 - see his thread <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11854>. When a major trend continues for more than a day, I look to using vs1_5c.   
  
Once 3b is set and running, I check on it periodically (every 1 hr) to see developing trends and perhaps switch-off. When I switch-off, I kill the last trade if PA is going wrong way. Do not trade it within 1 - 2 hours before major news items - switch off.   
  
Saw an earlier post where large SL is used with 3b. Not a good idea, it WILL clean you out. The nature of 3b is such that if you run it with TP40 and SL40 for +4 weeks, then it will be like flipping a coin, will come out about square, but with some big draw-downs. Overall, a 80TP and 40SL will give better returns, but the draw-downs can get VERY big. In back-testing, over broken 6 week ranging periods, net profits were +570 pips - it did have 6-8 consecutive loss trades in one period. This is all to stressful.  
  
I prefer using a small TP of 5, max 8. SL 100 is for emergency only, I kill the last trade when I detect a trend starting. I use pairs with small spread - EU, UJ. Multi pairs can be profitable, but when trends develope, it can become frantic to reduce potential losses.   
  
FB Vs1_3b Settings used are (4 digit broker):  
Chart_Time_Frame = 5  
MA_Length = 10  
MA_Timeframe = 15  
MAtype = 0  
Percent = 0.05  
TradeonFriday = 1  
Slip = 10  
Lots = 0.nn  
MaxOpenOrders = 1 (keep it simple)  
SafeArea = 5000  
PipStep = 25 (try smaller numbers, yes?)  
TakeProfit = 5   
StopLoss = 100 (try 40 or 60, yes?)  
TrailingStopFlag = false  
TrailingStop = 40  
TStrigger = 20  
MinMarginLevel = 25.0  
Trade from / to = your preference, I only switch on when I'm available to "supervise" the EA  
DivergenceLimit = 0.005 (0.10 for Jpy pairs)  
Other fields - use defaults  
  
Enjoy your trading!  
  
Andy

Thanks for your settings. I will try it as market reopens.  
But I'm afraid 5 pips tp. against 100 pips sl. is not a good profit/loss ratio. Just one loss will wipe away 20 winner trades.  
I will try it and see how it goes.  
Thanks for sharing.

Correct. I use 100 SL as I'm not always at the PC, therefore need to give the trade room to move. However, when I'm present and I see a trend developing, then I kill the trade immediately. Problem can be that one is already at the 80 - 90 pip loss point on returning to the PC, in which case you're looking at a big loss. Alternative strategy is to use a SL of 40 - 50pips, which you could hit more often. Experiment.  
  
If you activate the EA when the PA is straight-lining, you will see that it does make quite a few profitable trades. Win some profit trades then quit - if you leave it running for long periods, you will hit the SL.   
  
If I'm present at the PC for extended periods, then I prefer to trade manually with higher lots sizes, whereas with the EA's (3b or 5c) I use smaller lot sizes - use the smallest (0.01) to start with.   
  
Enjoy!  
  
Andy

Thanks to report this, it is very strange, i will investigate what happened by trying to simulate your operation. I will let you know.   
Normally there is a function in the EA that prevent to open a trade when a trade was just closed. It should wait for a minimum of 10 min before it initiate a new trade on version 1.5c.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Hi  
Sample of trades today.....These 3 x trades gave 5 pips each then I disabled the EA. I used UC to keep it apart from my other trades. Not sure whether I will continue with this usage of the EA, as it all depends on an accurate, subjective assessment of ranging vs trending markets - it can change so fast! Very good return if you get it right, bad if you get it wrong!  
  
Cheers  
  
Andy

Hi, the only think i can see that can cause this kind of behavior is the following.  
When you have trace a new Main trendline, you must have put it to close from the Price Action. So As long as you did not release left button on the mouse, the EA was not able to reset the description if it was hit. So it repeat itself. When you trace a trend line close to price action, do it fast and don't put it too close of PA.   
I will continue to monitor the EA, let me know if this happen while you did not touch the trend line, let me know.  
  
Best of luck ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Hi ActionPl,  
  
Thanks for your efforts! It is very strange, and very worrying. Could the above also happen when the "TrailingStopFlag" = False (in the original problem I used = True). I normally use = False, so if it only possble with the trailing stop facility, then for sure I will never use the trailing stop with this EA again!  
  
Best wishes   
Andy

For some reason my trailing stop function stopped working on 1.5c and 1.5d  
  
Anybody have any ideas?  
  
My settings are:  
Trailingstopflag: True  
Trailingstopdynamic: True  
Trailingstopmargin: 25  
Trailingstop: 25  
Tstrigger: 25

This is strange, the firebird ea's used to work fine for me and ever since I downloaded 1.5d I am experiencing problems.  
  
The hidden take profit and trailing stop are not working in 1.5d.  
here are is the set  
TP: 100  
SL:150  
TS flag_True  
TS Dynamic_True  
TS:25  
TSTrigger:25  
HiddenTP:50  
  
Neither the Trailing stop or the hidden TP are working.  
  
Could it be that I am running MT4 off of a USB flash drive so I can take it with me from work to home every day. I dont think this would have anything to do with it.

I will do some simulation using your setup to see what is wrong.

Thanks Action,  
One other strange thing I have noticed is that it will randomly close orders that are not close to the SL. It seems that the AUD/USD hit its hidden TP at 50 pips.  
go to my statement and look at dates from 8/21 to present. I have been using 1.5d since those dates.  
You will see today 8/31 on Gdp/USD there are a few closed trades at -4 pips all in a row.

Actionpl...  
  
Can you please send me a private message on how to contact you (apparently you don't have private messages turned on) as I have some code additions/changes/cleanups I want to discuss with you on your latest version of Firebird.  
  
Thanks.

Just waiting for everthing to turn blue before taking my firebird on the road for a long drive.  
  
What version of firebird are you all using? I'm a little scared to ask, so I'm currently using the one from post #1.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Would it be possible to modify the EMA indicator which only alerts when a new arrow was drawn?

Thanks Inquisitor, for posting.   
I'm still very much arround because I know that this ea can be made pafect if v.1.5d fix is out.   
Mainwhile can you share your settings on version 1.5c with a chat on how you draw your lines ?  
Most of times my trendline are hit, disabling the ea.

Hi markpips,  
I had the same problem, so I'm trying the following to correct the situation:  
I generally use the Demark trend (daily) for entry. I use default settings except for the usdjpy or eurjpy DivergenceLimit which needs to be increased (default is .002). I didn't know what to use, so I kept increasing until the error disappeared. I settled on .01. After entry I move the trend line down/up to about the SL and this gives the PA room for retracements. I also use the Sonic Channel to confirm the trend. I am comfortable with a 2 to 3 o'clock up channel angle for a buy or 4 to 5 o'clock down channel angle for a sell. Same for the trend lines. Also I try not to enter a buy near the top of a channel or a sell near the bottom of a channel. Don't forget to use money management to determine your lot size. I risk 1 to 1.5 percent so that my loss isn't too great when a trade goes the wrong way. Once a trailing stop is established, I just let it go. Good luck.

Hi I agree with you that there is no time to trade all day in Forex and the EA works great. I work with Forexmegatrion and I love it, because he trades 24/5 and without any emotions, so I am making profits. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Good luck in all your tadings.

Hi alain1,  
After establishing your trend line, double click on it so that the three boxes appear on you trend line. Next right click on the trend line and select trendline properties on the drop down. Write Main_UpTrend_Alert_, etc. on the description line. Be careful to pay atention to the caps. In order to view what you wrote you have to select any blank area of the chart and right click. Select properties on the dropdown. Select the Common Tab and check the bottom box "Show object descriptions". Trendline inscriptions should now appear. Discussions about this start on page 107 or 108. I'm having problems with 1.5d so I'm still using 1.5c. Good luck.

I tried both "long and short " on a wide area of both trends up and down. It seems to only pick up short orders. Feels like longs trades are turned off or something. Settings are all default no changes. Can somebody tell me what I am doing wrong?

I think you need the newer versions of this ea. Try version 1.5b, vers. 1 .5c or 1 .5d . coded by Actionpl.   
Pls. read at least from page 90 to find the aboved mention ea's and to understand very well the settings.  
I belive they are better.  
Happy trading.

Hello Fellow Traders,  
  
I have just finished reading a few dozen posts in this thread. It seems very similar to an idea I had a year or so ago. Not having read the entire thread it might have already been discussed but here goes. Having written a few automatic trading systems myself the key to any good system of course is filtering out the little bumps in the road so as not to place a trade too early. Even a trend line won't do that. It can really irritate the trader watching the PA continuing on its merry way after you already jumped off the train.  
  
Now I'm most likely posting this way too early in my understanding of this method but what caught my attention was the mentioning of a trend line. If you are manually drawing or even a code drawn line the buy and sell signals are still the same. Even with trend lines a bump in the road will occur and filtering these is critical to maximizing the trades.  
  
I have experimented with many different methods and one that seems to work the best is the stochastic K & D values. The mistake most coders of EA's do is write values to cross a fixed position or values such as the K value crossing a value of 80 signals a buy which is totally wrong as even the value 100 shows up in the middle of a long uptrend. The other problem is the PA reaching a high pivot point and never hitting 80 which makes the trade a loser when the PA promptly falls off a cliff.  
  
The best way to move the trade forward after hitting a high mark such as a trend line cross over or an indicator cross of a value is to have a filter such as stochastics K less than D on sells or D less than K on longs with adjustable settings. Let’s look at some examples below:  
  
On the M5 chart the PA moves across a trend line after a long down trend which ended at 9:00. The filter checks the value of stochastics K vs. D only after the first requirement of crossing the trend line is met.  
  
K Long setting = 5, K Short setting = 5  
  
EXAMPLE “A”  
  
9:00 PA = 1.5000 K = 5, D = 8  
  
9:05 PA = 1.5010 K = 20, D = 12, Long trade is made.  
  
EXAMPLE “B”  
  
9:00 PA = 1.5000 K = 5, D = 8  
  
9:05 PA = 1.5010 K = 13, D = 12, Long trade is NOT made.  
  
9:10 PA = 1.5020 K = 25, D = 18, Long trade is made.  
  
The PA can actually reverse and the initial trade never made due to the K settings not being reached. A second trade takes over at a much lower PA level which is what we are trying to accomplish.  
  
Other things must also be coded into the EA such as severe downtrends where a counter trend trade is particularly foolish and doesn’t move enough to cover the cost. This can be accomplished with simple codes and why most programs do not address this is crazy. At the very least counter trend trades should be looked at as topping out after crossing a MA-9 value and the K & D filter initiated after reaching no matter what the K or D value or what the slope of the PA for that matter. This will lock in positive trades before reversing in the middle of Bollinger Band channels. You will notice a lot of times the Stochastics value has reached a maximum value although the PA has topped out in the middle of an LRC, Price Channel or Bollinger Band Channel. Another way to recognize the PA trend is the Upper and Lower Bollinger Band values which keeps the trade from ever happening in a quickly consolidating PA. If you can stay out of the bad part of town you will stay a lot healthier.  
  
On an EA which includes stochastics I’ve had success with settings such as 5 and 95 on the K low and high settings which are the high success trades. After back testing the high success trades I then code the harder trades such as countertrend trades.  
  
I’ve also used this method with great success by adding code for Doji recognition and then initiating the filter. Any high or low value of any indicator seems to work great. The program just ignores all other bumps in the road unless a setting is hit to initiate the filter and thus a buy or sell signal. An exception is when the PA is in tight consolidation and trades are halted. If a trade is already in progress then it plays out. Drawing a channel of the consolidation with the PA highs and lows and initiating the filter after a break up or down restarts the program.  
  
Another useful add-in is code for the sudden huge moves that can move the stochastic K value from zero to 100 in one bar and then back down again the next bar. Percent of PA increase and decrease can handle these moves and buy or sell before initiating the filter. The possible downside is if the PA continues moving in that direction such as with some of the violent reversal moves at the start of this recession. Once all of your indicators top out and the PA is still moving though the roof, now what do you do? This actually happened to me as I was watching the EA trade the PA crossed an Upper Bols Band and stochastics K value hit 100. I was sitting with a nice profit and was waiting for the Short trade when the PA shot up like a rocket on the next bar and then the next and the next. A $6,000 additional move just occurred and I’m still in the game. The sell trade was finally satisfied. I had just redone the code from a hard sell at 100 to using the filter. I was just lucky this didn’t happen after a down bar and then it wood have hit my sell stop which is a large $400 per contract. Having anything less then that means you don’t trust your own program to handle the bumps in the road.   
  
The other thing that keeps showing up is all the excuses being made why their EA didn’t work at a particular time or doesn’t work on some currency pairs. That to me is just plain bull crap. A chart is a chart whether its currency pairs, stocks or whatever. Either the program works or it doesn’t work. It’s just that simple. I just read one that starts out saying his program was designed for GBPUSD. I’d like to know how he did that. What he should have said was it was the only pair that made any money and on all the rest he lost his butt. He’s publishing this hoping someone with more intelligence and trading experience can fix his screw-ups.  
  
All of the above I learned the hard way and I’m hoping some of you young coders will learn something about programming an EA from this. One thing I must add is the RSI indicator I would stay clear of as a filter as it doesn’t work well in this type of set-up. Another is the simple fact that unless the EA is based on a trend line with an indicator for filtering the cross all single indicator EA’s are not going to work all of the time or will they work on all charts. The fact is they will blow up your account.  
  
I have back tested this on the Daily chart with a semi-auto system over a 1 1/2 year period with only one loss of $50. I also did a similar test on the one hour with vitually the same results but just more trades. It works on all charts and on all time frames. I just don't have it for MT4 which is why I'm looking here at thia system.  
  
I hope this helps somebody and also hoping somebody that is a great coder takes the bull by the horns and programs these ideas into this program.  
  
Trade well and prosper,  
  
Johnny

Are you saying that, we need to filter the trades based on Stochastic K, D.... whenever K > D by 5 then trend is up and k< D by 5, then its short trend.?  
  
Can you please tell me, how exactly you want to apply the filter as I want to code this into this EA.  
  
Regards,  
Prakash

Thanks to the above posters for bringing this post back to the top so I stumbled across it. Read from page 90 or so... the impression that I get is version 1.5c doesn't comply with the NFA's hedging rules, and that version 1.5d isn't operable.  
  
Could someone set me straight on this?   
  
Thanks everyone. -J

Hello Prakash,  
  
Sorry I took so long to answer back. The point I was as making was the 5-8 EMA cross is garbage. The K-D values are much better but there are a number of better signals. Understand the optimum K-D values will vary with the settings of the stochastics.  
  
The other key point is the program itself which is not a bad visual aid for guiding the trader over a few bumps in the road but fails to stop the train at the main terminal so you can get off with maximum pips. The train by passes the station by five miles. The getting on the train is just as dangerous as by the time it finds out the direction it's heading a lot of it's cargo of pips got run over by the train.  
  
The solution and the way to design and code an efficient EA is to jump to the high/low points on the higher time frames. After the PA has reached these high/low points based on user input such as 80-20 stochastic values the trade is moved to the M1 chart values. The code then loops the exit/entry criteria such as the K-D values or a trailing stop is initiated. Both actually are necessary depending on the S & R values reached which again are user input values.  
  
The S & R values are indicators such as the Bollinger Bands or other lines of S & R. This method ignores all of the bumps in the road and it goes from point A to Z ignoring B-Y.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)  
  
It really is the most logical way to get to Z. If you were planning a trip from NY to LA the quickest and most direct route is to take a jet. This way the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains are not bumps in the road we have to worry about. Now the fact is that sometimes the jet might land in Reno and you have to board another flight but you will get to LA in the end.  
  
This type of trading system tells you the plane first has to go by way of Boston and leaves three hours late. It then lands in Chicago and lets you off without a continuing flight and no refund. When you finally get a flight out to LA at additional expense it by passes LA by 500 miles. They give you a parachute so you can jump out and hopefully land on a small deserted island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. You're very reluctant to do this but the Plane is out of gas and going to crash land anyway so you jump. Now your praying and hoping you land safely but the cold hard fact is the water is shark infested and the landing zone is very small.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f64f.png?v=15.1) Don't forget to close your eyes if you're like me and afraid of the sight of your own blood. LOL.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
The sharks (Professional traders) are always looking for juicy little snacks like you as we never stop eating.  
  
So if you're going to write an EA you must design it around good S & R values as well as a decent Entry and Exit. Without thoroughly understanding how to trade, no EA will fix that problem. The coder will only code to his ability and knowledge of trading or the lack of it which is so prevalent on the internet.:nerd:  
  
I see posts on many forums proclaiming money making EA's only to find a close to 50-50 win/lose ratio and bigger losses then winners. This one proudly shows a $12 million plus loss and a $9 million win and proclaims a 1.7 profit factor. Now I'm not an Einstein when it comes to math but even Jethro of the Beverly Hillbillies with a sixth grade education could figure this is not a good system.  
  
I had a retired engineer call me on the phone after posting on an automatic trading system thread asking me for advice about a system he was purchasing to supplement his retirement income. He stated it was a real money maker and it only cost $1400 initially and $400 a month there after. I asked him to email the analysis so I could see the win loss ratio and the $ loss / $ investment ratio on both the back and forward tests. He said he didn't have any of that type of information but the program produced 53% wins. I could tell by the way this guy was talking that his mind was already made up and no explanation of the facts from me was going to change this pilgrim's direction to the promise land. Now if an Engineer can be so stupid and not recognize that just flipping a coin will get you 50% then what is the hope of the multitude of people that can't grasp basic math and believe everything they read like the Martian found walking around NY or the talking pig in Iowa. I think our government hires way too many of these people and makes them bank examiners. They're all members of the "Be Kind to Dumb Animals Club". I think it's their natural preservation instinct.  
  
Let me know how you make out with this EA.  
  
Happy trades,  
  
Johnny

Looks like this thread has run outta steam 'cause many have grown tired of the semi-auto mode and would still love to have a cruise control button on their accounts. Well, like I posted earlier in this same thread, I'm a witness to the fact that there're fully auto EAs like this:  
<http://www.mt4i.com/users/trendmaster>   
  
I guess those who argue that mt4stats.com & mt4live.com are not all real statements will have to agree that mt4i.com uploads statements straight from the platform so seeing is believing.   
  
In any case, I've been in this business long enough to know that for every trader, you are your best friend or worst enemy based on your everyday trading decisions. Only a few have mastered the art. For the rest who haven't got the skill, time or both; get a bot to help you! 

From the tips to the dips, it's all about the pips

Hello 1800forex,  
  
Undoubtedly you're a newbie or at the very least not versed in the qualities of a good EA. Don't be blinded by the profits shown on the website as a better gauge of the good, the bad and the ugly is the losses and the profit factor. The profit factor of 1.9 is very low to the point of ridiculas. Anybody worth their salt as a trader could write a better performimg EA blind folded. My very first attempt at writing an EA as a newbie coder many years ago was 50 times higher than this.  
  
Understand that a professional trader looks for no less then 95% wins and would expect no less from an EA. This EA isn't even in the same ballpark and is obviously written by somebody who doesn't fully understand trading. The problem with these incomplete EA's is they can look good on some currency pairs some of the time but fail miserably most of the time. They cannot be traded on any chart or security and the seller will usually say I wrote this EA around a particular currency pair which is pure bull crap. The truth be known is that they kept looking until they found one that showed a profit. A decent EA will work on any chart whether it be currency, stocks or options. The mathematical formulas behind an EA don't know the difference between stocks or currency pairs because it's all just looking at the numbers.  
  
There are a few fair producing EA's on the internet but this isn't one of them. I've only ever found one worth anything at all. If you invest a dime on something like this you're an idiot and you should have the letters "DFI" tattood on your forehead.  
  
Learn to trade first before looking for the holy grail EA,  
  
Johnny

hi again, also the smile is on, i have 6 digit and i fixed that, and i have press the button "expert advisors", and i have "allow live orders",   
everything seems perfect!  
it just says in the "Expert messeges" at the terminal box, that "Experts are disabled because the account has been changed"  
what can I do to fix that?

I didn't posted in this thread for soooooo looong.  
I still belive this EA is one of the best I come cross to.   
  
One of the easiest method for driving this bad boy would probably be with a simple Parabolic SAR indicator. Its critical we found best trending pairs and deal with them. Actually this EA makes also good resolds in sideways market with both Long and Short option on.   
  
So the idea is...pull up daily/weekly chart best trending pairs you could find (e/u g/u..itc). Plot simple Parabolic SAR and drive the EA with the trend flow.   
  
Small swings might hurt us a little as the indicator change direction, but real money is on big swings. Where loses should be covered.

Gas Gas, I think I'll have to agree with you there, it only makes sense using this instead of MACD and others, I'm struggling a little to understand Phillips 4Hr with MACD, maybe I must look further into WHAT exactly of Samurai's method with this AMAZING indicator she/he uses, perhaps if you're reading this Sam you could actually answer this? Well, ANYWAY, comparing this indicator to the trendline with the EA which i believe is rather profitable, for newbies I wonder if a programmer out there could code the v63G EA with the parabolic SAR and then control buy/sell with THAT?????? cos yes, for me it's such a shlepp trying to FIND the damn trend when using this EA instead when the trend starts changing the par would be MUCH better indicator cos it's an indicator that plots itself! what you guys think? Seniors?? then it would work on the same principles as the trend line with EA?

Can you define resold for this EA and how you determine trending or sidesways, also what OTHER pairs do you have besides e/u g/u, are there any other trendy pairs you use? do you trade u/cad?

Not sure if this has been covered yet, but have you looked at mptm, by i believe steve hopwood (correct me if i'm wrong please) this is a trade management tool i use quite often especially for a reliable exit. I found it at ff and have been using it as an exit strategy for ALL the ea's i use.

I don't know if anyone else is using Sams semi auto method with FB but if we look at EUR/USD pair CURRENTLY there is a nice steady downward, now SURELY you can't JUST ACTIVATE the EA and expect it to start running...or can you, does one really HAVE to wait for this 5-8 indicator before you "awaken the great beast" ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) ? Can you not as with the example of EUR/USD wait for a retracement THEN enter when there's red again, the indictor might not pop up?  
Also:  
Sam says she trades GBP/USD (her previous threads prove this), I don't know if this is such a good idea at the moment as it's WAY to choppy and changy right now, I have tried entering a couple times with no sucess, problem is, one CAN'T REALLY determine how LONG our little trend is gonna be, i have been trying to enter lately because i hear month end to beg next month is trendy for pairs (esp EUR/USD)

This is a script created by Steve Hopwood that sets/adjusts stops, opens/closes trades, steps, trails...basically a complete trade management tool.  
I use it quite often to set a global % SL so that of all trades that are open, it can take profit or stop loss at a defined $ amount or %. You can set it to only affect a particular magic number or all trades, etc. There's quite a bit of documentation + the tool ((free) at the site below.  
Hope you guys find it as useful as I do,   
Cheers,

Is anyone actually USING Samurai's V1.3b EA together with the Demark_trend_new indicator. I'm DESPERATELY trying to find out how this indicator WORKS. What I mean is I've been trying to see how it works on M1 (see how it operates in quick time before I use it on D1) and the lines keep changing so one doesn't really know HOW this works, there are various lines (thick and thin) and an X and arrow, does the arrow indicate buy and sell or what, can someone PLEASE send me a lot of info on this indi and if i have other questions about it if you'd be willing to give me a hand I'd really apprecite it, what would be even BETTER is to take V5D and continue on where Action left off, he nearly had it perfect but unfortunatly he hasn't posted here for a LONG time. Perhaps one could even CODE this indi INTO this bad boy?????????  
Appreciate someone's help here???

Sorry guys Im not active here anymore. Im discussing this SAR idea with someone at the moment and I'll attached resoults of some tests I did a while ago. This aproach can be tuned up for sure, but I tryed the easiest way, simpley: When SAR dot shows up above price, we go short, and we ride short until dot shows up under price, then we change to Long. Thats it.   
I didnt test this live so I dunno. Oh..and as I remember there was no SL and TP was 100pips.

Probably couse of different feed, EA sometimes dont open positions all day but in general in a few days it should open trades. Check settings on mt4 and EA again if all good. Oh and it depends what pair are u trading, it dont work on all pairs.

Hi guys,  
  
I have been trying the template given by Samuraipower... the one which shows Heiken Ashi Candles, a yellow 21-EMA, and the indicator which shows arrows that signal buy and sell.  
  
But I noticed one thing... (i dunno if it's my imagination... But I assure you, I am recording things on a journal)...  
  
Sometimes, the indicator (w/ arrows) shows buy/sell signals on the previous candle, but suddenly, in the middle of the day, the signal of the PREVIOUS candle just disappears. This usually happens when the signal is opposite of what the market is doing. It seems that the indicator is hiding its mistake? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)  
  
Let me give an example:  
  
The daily candle of GBP/JPY showed a BUY on 09/12/10. So on the open of the candle of 09/13/10, I entered a BUY trade. Unfortunately, GBP/JPY went south instead of north (horrors! a 100+ loss). And guess what... the BUY signal generated on the 09/12/10 candle is nowhere to be found!!   
  
This is mysterious for me because, I traded on the candle **_AFTER_** the candle which showed the signal.   
  
Have you encountered this?  
  
I think this occurrence can really endanger the reliability of the EA, since we would sometimes be driving it in the wrong direction.  
  
Feedback would be appreciated.

That indicator repaints...That means DO NOT TRUST iT !! Or better erase that indicator from template. Those arrows are there just to give u a clue whats going on with the price NOT to make trading calls with it. You will find out that most indicators repaints or lag so your best indicator is PRICE. By that I mean Price action - Candle Formations itc...

You do not need any hieken ashi candle to trade this system. Just place 3 emas on the 4hr chart 30/60/120 whatever direction they face trade the EA that way. For your info I trade the EA live and profitable. Just use good money management. To give you an idea of how profitable the system is. Go through all the pairs and watch what happens when price breaks or touches the 4hr 120ema (20 ema on daily).

Good idea...so I guess start would be when price nicely breaks ema120 right, then all emas just start facing same direction. But always had been a problem when to stop trading and pause. How you deal range market? would be nice to hear more from you mate.

Thank you for your question. I trade with the 30/60/120 ema on the 4hr as part of my trading repertiore that includes the (GU intraday system-my creation). Now the key to using this EA as long as price remains below the 120 ema with the 30 and 60 ema in line, I remain short and vice versa. I only change when I have a daily close above or below the 120 ema. (I adjust the ea only on a daily close.  
  
Then I enter the trade in the direction of the new trend. At this time I am watching the last swing low or high on the 4 hr as a confirmation of the new trend as long as price does not break below that low the new trend is valid(definetly there would be a pull back).  
  
Otherwise the simpler way is to search for pairs with already established trends using the 3 emas and drive the ea that way. For example this is the chart of the euraud, you can see what happened when price broke the 120 ema on the 4 hr price pulled back and found support there. This also concided with the 1.4000 round number barrier zone. So we have a daily close above and I will drive the ea long until price breaks below and closes off the 120 ema on a daily close. Trading like this you would have less whipsaws and catch those big moves that the forex market is known for.  
It also gives you time to check up on the market news and know what is driving price action, thereby giving you more confidence on your trades. I hope this helps.

Thank you Sir for quick response and answers. Trading like this makes sence in many ways. Will look more into that and mabey start trading this EA again. Minde me asking also what is your pip step, TP and SL settings?  
Or mabey even with no SL since its manually controled.

Alright guys sorry, I did not answer your questions immediately.   
  
1\. I trade all the majors including the major exotic pairs.   
  
2\. I trade the EA with the ATR value of each pair. i trade using 3 trades for each pair with a total risk exposue of 6 per cent  
  
3\. I first run through all the pairs looking for established trends using the 30/60/120 ema. These are the pairs I give priority. Then I keep my eyes on potential trades. Go through the charts with just the 3 emas and you can see how effective this system is.  
  
4\. I use the same ea on this thread, i just drive the ea either short or long.  
  
5\. Never trade without a stop loss.  
  
6\. I use the default pip step but may adjust by 10-20 pips depending on the volatility of the pair.  
  
7\. Fundamentally, I am always long audusd and audjpy cause of the high interest rate differential.

You know okehiedon, you are a HERO, it seems like this driving idea WORKS!  
So..to all those who are keeping tabs on this thread I think we need to add okehiedon on the celebrity list for THIS specific EA:  
  
Samurai:For thinking up such a brilliant idea for this EA  
Pips: for programming AND improving it continuously AND  
Okehiedon: For a very good idea on how to actually DRIVE this baby  
  
So well done and thank you!  
  
I'm sure all readers here agree these three deserve a round of applause "clap, clap, clap".  
  
Ok, now that's out the way, Oke, I like your way of STARTING the trend, I just have a question concerning it:  
1) You speak of "price" going over last swing (H4), is this now CLOSING price or price in general?  
  
2) Referring attachment:  
I'm giving a long trend example here now: On Monday just gone (3/9/2010) daily closed above 120ema on EUR/USD pair, now on H4, as far I can see the lowest price here is 1.2587 now you say the price mustn't go further down 1.2587 if it does then the trend isn't valid, which ulitimately means one cannot go long? There is one thing i don't understand is how do you determine these "swings" where to pick up these swings for lowest prices to declare a trend invalid and do you use ema's for these swings? Far i understand 31/08 @8am and 10  
10/9 @ 4am are "bottom" swings and it hasn't gone further under than 1.2587 which means coming "long" trend is still valid???  
  
3) Also, I'm not sure if my strategy is correct but in the example because the H4 is under ema 120 it means a possible LONG on D1 correct??  
  
  
Thank you

Hi Behman,  
As far I understand no, EUR/AUD isn't ready to go long yet,  
reason: D1 closing price isn't above 120 ema yet ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Oh, one more thing Oke i forgot to ask, in the previous comment i sent the price never went further down, but IF closing price had been above 120 ema on D1 and H4 price gone further down than 1.2643 one can then continue short correct (if you WERE ALREADY short on previous trade-meaning say you were short then D1 closing went above 120ema and the pair started ranging, D1 closing then went below)?

Thanks for all the answer, can you please explain better this point?

Zukies thanks for the complement, but actually is nothing new.  
  
Please take note we only trade **the 4hr chart and not daily. The EMAs are only for the 4 hr chart.**  
  
For example when price breaks above the 120 ema on the 4hr chart.We would like to see **a daily close** **with price above the 120 ema on the 4hr chart**. Before we have a valid change of trend and thereby drive the EA in that direction.   
  
You would now place the EA main trend line to pass through the swing low of the price swing that broke the 120 ema, because usually price would retrace and if it is a valid change of trend it would not break that low. So we would have the ea enter the new trend at a discount (usually I use 40 pips step on the usd pairs and 50-55 on the jpy pairs). This was the case with the eurusd which I immensely benefited from.  
  
The euraud as I adviced in my earlier post is already in an uptrend , remember break of **120 ema on 4hr chart** and if you had entered as I showed in the chart I posted earlier you would already be in the money.  
  
But guys note that I stop driving the ea in the direction of the trend when the **daily chart is overdone. That is when the daily rsi is above 70 or under 30**. It means a reversal may be in place and usually price at such levels reverse quickly.  
  
I hope this helps

greven if you have traded the ea on this thread you would see it has a provison for entering the number of trades you want as price moves against you.   
  
Every Pair has a different daily range value and we want to have realisitc stop loss and take profit levels. For example the daily range of EU is 138. So I calculate my stop loss/ take profit using values from 1, 1.5 or 2 x ADR. What that means is that we would survive any minor retracement against the trend and enter on a discount as the ea takes trades in the direction of the prevailing trend. Because we have used realistic take profit levels we expect our objective to be hit within 2 days and as price retraces the ea enters at a discount and the cycle continues.   
Remeber when you are trend trading you can only be wrong once. That is when the trend breaks and reverses. Off course the EA,s trend line functionality is an added advantage as it reduces the stop loss by half if price touches the trend line.  
  
Also note that we want to identify and profit from the meduim term trend. That is why we use the 30/60/120 ema on the 4hr. A quick look through all the charts in your charting package would reveal how few whipsaws you would have using the 3EMAs to determine trend direction.

Finally before I take my break today.  
  
To help confirm the trend direction when trading USD pairs apply the 30/60/120 ema on a 4 hr chart of the US Dollar Index(professional trading tip![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f910.png?v=15.1)). The trend on that index will determine dollar stength or weakness on all your forex pairs.  
  
For yen pairs the general rule is Usd Jpy determines overall trend direction of the yen pairs. However it is not as definite as the dollar index. In most cases when the dollar is weak on all fronts the other yen pairs are quite choppy.

Just one last question, do you use the Ea with the Trendline to be draw or the original one from the 1th post?

Ok just give you bit of idea, I'm rather new to this manual trading i must admit so if you dont mind I'm going to come with LOTS of questions because i really want to get this idea right ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
Ok, I admit i made mistake, i used 120 on daily as well instead of 20 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) now my eur/aud makes sense, just three things, if we just trade daily and watch for ema break on daily and H4 could we do this instead of using ema's and trend line or are the ema's and trend line just safety feature. I see just with 120 ema and 20 we get a LOT of trades ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Can we do this??? or not  
  
And...you speak of USD index which is actually going DOWN, EUR/USD is picking up or is it just a STRENGTH indicator meaning if the price is close to 120 ema H4 then the trend is weak???

From my chart it doesn't seem the case? in fact, this pair is STILL under 120 ema so i wouldn't have opened because trend is invalid? But i see a bit later that price IS rising onH4 so you are right?

Zukies, we trade the   
  
1\. 4hr charts not the daily chart.  
  
2\. I refer to a daily close on the 4hr chart of price below or above the 120 ema.  
  
3\. Since you are new to this type of trading,your best option is to search for already established trends on the 4hr chart using the 30/60/120 ema and drive the EA in that direction.

As an example on the EurCHf. Price breaks the 120 and then closes above for that day. On the **NEXT DAY** 16 sep we initiate a long trade ( the green line )on the EA .

Zukies, the questions you are asking me indicates that you have not gone through the thread on how to trade the EA. The EA needs a trend line to be drawn to help it know when it stops taking trades. When the trend line is broken by price the EA stops trading.   
  
So take the time, to study the thread, I am just making inputs on how to identify the medium term trend to drive the EA.  
  
However I have attached a chart on possible trend lines on the eur aud current uptrend there is an outer trend line and an inner trend line.

I have been through this thread but a while ago, i know there are VARIOUS versions of this robot even floating around this thread, i just thought you wouldn't be using trend lines to drive this EA that's all ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Concerning the above comment from you the trend line should be drawn THROUGH the last swing not next to it and you have drawn TWO which confuses me, which one now can one use for the EA the inner or outer and why??  
Also, can you elaborate more on how to draw these trend lines because as i say, in the previous comment you said the line should go THROUGH the last swing (I'm trying to draw trend lines now as accurate as possible)  
  
Do you have to keep editing your trend line to suit the trend or is the one by the long entry enough for the whole trade?  
  
Thank you for your time and patience, the only real thing I'm now struggling with currently is HOW to DRAW these trend lines (I mean I might draw my line WAY different to yours and my EA stops trading too early and when there IS another trade the EA should take it doesn't because of my trend line being too close?), you seem to have a good technical way of drawing them so I would appreciate your help in this regard ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
Samurai DOES give PDF's on this point but those notes just DON'T make sense to me, only REAL thing i picked up was that you shouldn't draw your trend lines too CLOSE to candles but that doesn't help me at all! is why i ask for further advice from you.  
And BY the way, I THANK you for what you're doing here with your explanations so your help IS HIGHLY appeciated

The two trend lines are useful. I will use the first trend line to stop the ea from trading. Because if it gets broken the next price target would be the second trend line, a drawdown I am not ready to take cos of the multiple fundies coming out this week.

Are you using the 1.5c or 1.5d?  
I've tried the D version but apart the Ts that don't work it seems to close position totally random.

I use 1.5b, here is it trading on the eurjpy. You can also see the power of the 30 ema as price pullbacks to it and continues its upward swing.

Tell me, is your TP/SL same for all pairs you trade? 100 and 300 (for 4 digit broker)?

I do not use a fixed tp/sl. I usually use 1.5 Atr to set my stops and targets. The rational behind the 1.5 is that in my opinion on a healthy trend price will pull back but would not close below the previous day low. So I believe that if price pulls back and hits my stops which is 1.5 ATR then the trend is weakening.

Hi  
  
I'm a new member in this forums. Hi to all guys.  
  
I've been reading this post for hours and I'm really interested in tihs EA. Actually, I started trying on demo some of ther versions in full automatic on Metatrader some days ago, and I feel that this EA is great.  
  
Does anybody use any version in full automatic real? What versions? I'm testing the original, 1.3a, 1.5 and 1.5c. Original and 1.3a are working ok, but 1.5b only traded once and 1.5c hasn't traded yet.  
  
I read all the parameter configurations in this long post and don't know why 1.5c doesn't work, and 1.5b only once. Could somebody give some clues?  
  
Thanks so much and congratulations for your great job guys!  
  
Greetings

Thanks for that, I hardly know anything about ATR and have been googling on this subject. Am i right by saying that ATR for GBP/USD pair (one I'm currently trading) is sitting on (using 14 period) on the D1 TF: 152*1.5=228 TP/SL?   
  
If I'm right with this calculation do you have to use the previous days candle value to use for TP and SL for all future orders (all the way down your retracement) and is TP and SL same??  
  
Or is this comPLETELY wrong, if so, please help me with this? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

This indicator gives the daily range.   
I input the 1.5 ATR value into the EA. Then using my risk mgt allowance I set the lot size. I sometimes just use 1x ATR depending on the strength of the trend and my perception of market sentiment

Hi  
  
Very interesting! Looks interesting the idea of conditioning your SL and TP to the ATR. I'm testing in demo some versions at the same time, and of course I'm testing your semi-automatic strategy wit the 30-60-120 EMA, but on 1.3a (I know you are using 1.5b). I'll let you know about my results...  
  
What about fully automatic? Did you try Firebird v1.3a or any other versions with successful results? I've been testing v1.3a in full automatic in eur/usd for some days non-stop and it doesn't look bad. I know it's just only few days, but I want to try it for a long time in demo. So, of course, I'll tell you how it works!  
  
I'm using 100 for SL and TP, with Ayoneeyee's sepcs (read back in the post). Is anybody else testing automatic?   
  
Thanks

Just three things:  
  
1)Thanks for indi, from what I understand it's same thing as the default ATR ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1), I MUCH prefer getting digital reading of ATR value than mousing over some wave at bottom, just can't understand why they have TWO periods for ATR instead of one? I'm also using (14) period because I believe its most popular amongst traders? just disregard the SECOND ATR.  
The RmUp/down is just confusing though, according to the net when it's green it's "trade" when it's red it's "no trade"? I suppose this works in conjunction with TWO readings of ATR so if you have ONE reading of ATR(14) just watch that one's Rm???? (Risk Management???) and I see there's a VALUE for Rm, how would that work with this Risk management?  
  
2) What pipstep you use for Eur pars (Aud, Gbp etc)  
  
3) If one uses ATR as TP/SL then it would mean when price goes against you ATR gets smaller value meaning as trades open TP/SL gets smaller, so end of day SL would be on same price (roughly) for all open trades???  
  
Thanks

Hi all,  
I'm not sure if anyone is using 1.3b but i prefer it above the newer versions simply because it's simple and i got it to work ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) the problem i have is I'm not sure how trustworthy and reliable my broker REALLY is, apparently they hunt stops and manipulate feeds so, I'm wanting to know if someone would be able to program 1.3b to add a line or two of code FROM v5d (cos it hides your trades) to hide the trades from the broker.  
The other versions work with breakouts and I'm not exactly sure how to turn them off AND use "Uptrend/DownTrend_Alert_10" at the same time, perhaps someone could help me out with 5d or I just stick with 1.3b??

I usually use 3 orders for each pair. What that means is that I divide the ATR by 3 to get the pip step for each pair. Only the ADR value is relevant for this system.

So you telling me that one divides the ADR value by 3 and NOT the ATR value? As also the TP/SL (the ADR value is used) and that you change your pipstep and TP/SL EVERYDAY because your ADR (or) ATR value changes daily???

I have been back testing this EA, firebird 1.5c ...combined with the cornflower 4H strategy,...  
The results are unbelievable!!  
  
I backtested on Aussie, kiwi and euro...for intermittent periods of time (once I see trends)..  
  
Right now, I am forward testing with a moving average stop loss (24 ema)  
so, that the trades do NOT go out of control...  
its still early days of forward testing..  
I will post my results soon..  
  
I think this seems to be an experiment well worth my time.

Thanks WFX...  
  
Like I said earlier...  
I am posting my back tests results for euro...  
  
Attached please find my screen shots of euro 4h chart with the cornflower tpl.  
  
The way I take trades or start my automation of trades (meaning in real time : turn on the Firebird), is when the price crosses the cornflower EMA...i.e. EMA 24....  
AND at the same time I use this same EMA as my stop loss...  
so, my stop loss is being moved along the 24 ema up or down, depending on the direction of the trend..  
  
This is the foundation.  
(please understand this is a deviation from the cornflower entry method...  
as explained by Lever70) I am using cornflower 4H only to monitor my trades.  
  
attachments titled eurusd 1, and 2  
shows where I enter (Yellow line)  
and my exit (red line)..  
REMEMBER, cornflower EMA is controlling my entry and exit.  
  
  
_(The blue areas in the screen shots are supposed to be where the trading hit some losses..as you can see, its minimal number of pips provided that the firebird is controlled by the 24 ema/cornflower)_

Hi,   
thanks for shareing yor results. It is really intresting. But I do not understand how you set your stop loss ? Because in the EA it is fix. Or do you change your stop loss in the EA ? Do you use the trend lines ?  
  
I am going to try your system.  
  
Thanks in advance

Since trend analysis is set to false so trend line is not being used by supercat. I dont know how the ea is using cornflower ema for exit...and when to set ea on

Supercat1977 ,  
  
Thank you for sharing your results . I think, they are very good, only I am worried about the $791.2 maxDD for $1.00 lot, but , in the end no Losses right ... and a very nice profit overall. I am looking forward to testing it.

Szabolcs,  
yes, The stop loss is hard coded in the firebird to 200 or 300 pips..  
but, we should monitor the trades with a MA stop loss EA (for forward testing) to reflect the effect of my back testing...  
  
so that the MA trail stop takes over the fixed stop once the firebird is running..(provided price moves above or below the 24 ema)  
  
**In my forward testing..**  
yes, I am using the trend lines...I think thats the only way to make this thing work in a specific direction based on the trend.  
  
Also, I am using this EA for my MA trailing stop loss (same pair but a different chat)  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...59&postcount=4](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3589959&postcount=4)  
  
and the settings are explained here:  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...36&postcount=6](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3590336&postcount=6)  
  
yes, let us know how the system works for you...  
its basically a trend system with multiple orders at small intervals...  
and not letting any of these series of trades go out of control by using an EMA trailing stop loss.  
  
Thanks.

indranghimir ,  
In my forward testing...  
yes, I have to use trend analysis set to true..  
if not the firebird doesnt take any trades  
  
my results are for back testing.  
for forward testing..we have to combine this with a MA trailing stop loss EA along with this...for my theory to work.  
  
The ea is turned on once the price crosses the 24 ema..up or down..  
then...use trend lines to command the automation.  
  
Thanks

Footy,  
If you are going to use the daily chat..you could have a bigger drawdown...BUT of course with bigger GAINS...  
and less frequent intervention.  
  
I cannot stomach anything that has a max. DD of more than 10-15%...  
its totally against my trading principles.  
  
But..please let us know how it is working for you..  
I would love to see your results.  
  
Thanks

sergen4,  
There will be small losses..when the price is hugging around the 24 ema..  
refer to the blue areas in my post 1956.  
these are inevitable..we are helpless..the market will slice us anyways...  
but since we have tight control with 24 ema..we do not lose much..  
I havent taken the trades in the blue areas into consideration..  
but, I can tell you its **negligent** considering the overall gains.  
  
You could limit your DD by manipulating these 2 variables in the settings:  
**_The settings for back tests are as follows:_**  
  
s0="Section for Trend Analysis"; TrendAnalysis=false; EmailAlert=false; PopupAlert=false; TrendLine_watch=false; Reduce_factor=2; Trend_line_Keep=3; AutoTrend_timeperiod=240; s1="Section for Autotrade"; Manage_Trade=false; Heiken_Ashi_timeperiod=240; index=1; email=false; s2="Section for FireBird"; Chart_Time_Frame=5; MA_length=21; MA_timeframe=5; MAtype=1; Percent=0.05; TradeOnFriday=1; slip=25; Lots=0.1; **MaxOpenOrders=5** ; SafeArea=10000; **PipStep=100** ; TakeProfit=1000; Stoploss=2000; s3="Section for Trailing stop"; TrailingStopFlag=false; TrailingStop=200; TStrigger=200; MinMarginLevel=250; TradeFrom1=0; TradeUntil1=24; TradeFrom2=0; TradeUntil2=0; TradeFrom3=0; TradeUntil3=10; TradeFrom4=0; TradeUntil4=0; s4="Section for iFXAnalyzer"; Fast_Period=23; Fast_Price=1; Slow_Period=84; Slow_Price=1; DivergenceLimit=0.1; Use_V63D_Divergence=false; IncreasementType=0; PipsLoss=500; GMT=2; DST=0; OpeningHour=0; ClosingHour=24; writelog=0;   
  
**MaxOpenOrders=5** (max. no. of open trades at one time floating); reducing this...will surely decrease the drawdown..  
  
  
**PipStep=100** (opens a trade at every 10 pips); increase to 20 or 40, would reduce the DD as well..  
  
But, keep in mind that this will reduce your gains **significantly**.  
  
Go for it..  
I would love to see your results.  
  
Thanks,

thanks for your new idea about entry and exit using firebird and conflower .  
are you manually exiting the trade? i could not find out how to exit the trade by ea using ema 24.  
i would love to contribute by carrying out forward testing.

indranghimir,  
I am using this trailing stop ea for exit, because the trend line commands for close orders are not working for me:  
  
An MA trailing stop loss   
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...59&postcount=4](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3589959&postcount=4)  
  
and the settings are explained here:  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...36&postcount=6](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3590336&postcount=6)  
  
put it on the same pair but on a new chart.  
  
I am not getting the results like the way I want it..  
But, I think...I know the answer...I need to spend more time on this..  
  
these are the trend line commands I was talking about..  

  1. **UpTrend_Close_Alert_: will close all open buy order**
  2. **DownTrend_Close_Alert_: will close all open sell orders**

  
you could try and see if you experience the same problem or not..  
  
  
because I think its very important that the EA stops creating orders once it crosses the 24 EMA...because that means we are changing directions...  
  
would like your input on this..  
  
Yes...I would love to see your forward tests..will help me learn about this more.  
  
Thanks

supercat1977 ,  
  
Thank you very much for all your help, support you have been kindly providing.  
  
I have been continuing studying/reading this thread for a while now. With the settings you have provided I am getting incredible results (for me they are),  
that I have to re-do it again if this is real . I back tested on GBPUSD December 01 2010 to feb 02 2011 with different profit targets . I am really pleased with the backtests results . Today I put the EA on Live Account with your settings but with 0.01 Lots about 7 hours ago , so far no trades no activity . I will inform back if this EA works on my broker, because with some other EAs, I used before, I sometimes get Error 130 invalid stops ,for reasons I dont know and when that happens the EA didnot work. I hope Firebird works on my broker.

Firebird v63H04?  
  
I have been toiling on this all weekwend without avail. CAn someone please help me?

Unfortunately, my forward tests seems to be really useless..  
  
and I just feel like the firebird is not functioning like its supposed to..  
I am using the 1.5c version...  
I think the one at the front page is 1.5b version?  
I havent used that yet..  
  
I want to know if sergen4  
had any success with it?  
  
_**I think its time to adapt...**_  
  
Thanks

I have been playing with Ronald Raygun's directional grid trader a little.... in conjunction with the cornflower 4h system for entries and exit.(visual purpose only...{read my previous posts})  
  
It is definitely generating some crazy profits...only thing that I am slightly uneasy about is the max. DD...   
  
I will be posting my back test results here soon..  
  
I hope... and I am thinking... this thread is not limited to only Firebird and its derivatives/versions..  
  
Let me know if anybody has any objections..I can move out of your way!!  
  
Thanks..  
  
P.S: GRID TRADER EA is found here...

for the people who have missed my firebird experiment:  
The rules of entry and exit remain the same but I am just using GRID TRADER EA instead of firebird EA...just because I was not getting the trades like the way I wanted on firebird...meaning I did not have any success with it ...actually, I tried it on a lot of pairs as well..  
  
Anyways..  
I am using this grid trader..because the way I had the settings in Firebird was for it to take trades at every 10 pip interval provided it satisfied the entry conditions inside the robot...  
  
But, now..with this grid trader..it doesnt have to satisfy any entry conditions for it to take trades..but just the movement of price up or down in our predefined grid steps or intervals...and it will start doing its job!!  
  
**hopefully..the demo-forward testing on this EA should yield good results...lets see!!**  
  
Thanks

**_The method or concept is the same as the one I explained before..  
in my earlier posts..  
but..I just changed it to grid trader ea.  
_**  
Attached please find my screen shots of euro 4h chart with the cornflower tpl.  
  
The way I take trades or start my automation of trades (meaning in real time : turn on the grid trader ea), is when the price crosses the cornflower EMA...i.e. EMA 24....  
AND at the same time I use this same EMA as my stop loss...  
so, my stop loss is being moved along the 24 ema up or down, depending on the direction of the trend..  
  
This is the foundation.  
(_**please understand this is a deviation from the cornflower entry method...  
as explained by Lever70  
  
[http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...00&postcount=1](http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=276100&postcount=1)**_)   
  
**I am using cornflower 4H only to monitor my trades visually.**  
  
attachments titled eurusd 1, and 2  
shows where I enter (Yellow line)  
and my exit (red line)..  
REMEMBER, cornflower EMA is controlling my entry and exit.  
  
  
_(The blue areas in the screen shots are supposed to be where the trading hit some losses..as you can see, its minimal number of pips provided that the EA is controlled by the 24 ema/cornflower)_

This is the screen shot of my forward testing on EURUSD..  
  
I am on **sell** as per the rules I explained above..to enter the trades...  
and the signal given by the ema cross indicator d/l from the first page of this thread...  
  
I modified it to suit my requirements..

(...Unfortunately, my forward tests seems to be really useless..  
  
and I just feel like the firebird is not functioning like its supposed to..  
I am using the 1.5c version...)  
  
Sorry to hear that, I wonder why ? FireBird 1.5c had very good performance in the backtests . It took me quite a while to figure it out how to set it , (I amNot still sure if MA type should be 0 or 1) . I let it run today Live starting from London open but No activity, no trades so far. So I cant say anything about its performance.

Hi sergen4,  
  
I had the same problem with firebird..it was not taking any trades...  
and if it did it... was only on specific pairs only..and of course..very inconsistent!!  
  
I understand your apprehension about grid trading...  
Its true...that it requires a lot of margin..depending how much gridding levels you want to introduce...(Hence..I tend to use penny/dime lot size)  
  
But..I respect your point of view...  
  
To me...and just my opinion...and mine only...  
controlled gridding with appropriate stops is another name for pyramiding of trades...to max. your returns..  
  
also..if this system with grid level=1, it behaves like a normal trend trading system with defined exit and entries..just a thought..  
  
Would definitely love to see results with this system.  
  
I have emailed Ronald Raygun the details about this system..hopefully he can introduce a code with which the exits and entries are mechanical...based on the EMA cross and only after going through a buffer of 20-40 pips (to partially tone down the whipsaw losses)..  
  
Vamos a ver (lets see!!)  
how things progress..  
  
Thanks

Hi,  
  
Your setting is not tally with the ea you have given. Do you use different version of grid trader ea?

This should be the correct version.

The earlier post is actually an earlier version.

Hello  
Is there a version which could handle 2 digit settings like Gold?  
Even if not the fully automated one, the semi autolmated would be even better.

Hi guys,  
Thought I might be of some assistance for those battling to get their EA started ESPECIALLY live, this one runs LIVE on 4 digit broker, it runs withOUT trend line just plug and play, now concerning trail stop, I don't know if runs TS but from what I've seen on demo it doesn't, I'm going to be using this with Parabolic SAR (Check few pages back for that entry/exit), it's got serious dd but hey, end of year you got some $$ in your pocket ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) it will only open 3 trades at time  
Hope this helps someone out there battling, it's 1.3b, as i say,just plug and play

Aggghhh...sorry man lol when I renamed it I renamed it firebird.ex4(4digit broker) instead of firebird(4 digit).ex4 is why it didn't come out as link in first place but ANY way I'm gonna be using [liteforex](/brokers/liteforex "View LiteForex Broker Profile"), look, these guys SUCK with EA's for some unknown reason (I mean, their [SPREADS](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are good but they still suck???) already tried with fapturbo, alright for while but you start losing. The ONLY read reason why I'm going BACK is 20% deposit and 1.5 pip rebates, so, get yourself 5m GBP/USD chart, put firebird on this one, then put a daily on with Parabolics, then just change when par changes ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) I'm running as we speak, haven't lost anything DRASTICALLY yet ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) AND the 1.5 pip rebate (which you HAVE to register for on your account...SEPERATELY by the way but you get paid immediately onto your account as you trade) ALSO helps put $$ in your pocket. Look, I've always liked lite even though they suck with EA's, I KNOW they pay, never had problems with that so I reckon this would be good combo esp for people working full time. All you do is check once a day (I do in mornings) where you SAR is sitting, if the SAR has changed close open orders and change around. As I said before, you WILL get serious dd but hey, nowdays every bit helps ($$ wise), just a quick backtest on couple months shows some decent results even if one has some ranging to go through and lose couple pips. I'm starting with $100 on 0,01 lot, then when it reaches $200 put up to 0.02, this is my plan, soon it'll build up, maybe in year or so I'm looking at $1000 on 0,1 lot size ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

While I was busy trading (live I might add) I saw one of my trades was supPOSED to close already and hadn't, i then looked at my settings and found that TP and SL aren't right, currently it says 1000 and 3000 respectively, they SHOULD be showing 100 and 300 respectively, just take out the one 0 on both of them, your TP should be 10 when it closes (on 0,01 lot)  
Sorry, I'm unaware about the mq4 version, I'll check in my downloads sometime, if I find I'll upload ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) but this version works????? Dunno why you wanna change anything??  
Cheers  
(If anyone gets stuck pls let me know I'll just upload the corrected version here)

Hi Zukies  
  
I thank you for the effort uploading the 4 digit version, how ever I would like to use this baby on Gold. Which has only 2 digit. I tried to modify settings, but no luck. Would you be able to help?

par is parabolic sar, when it changes direction you change direction too, but here's another idea which I'm also going to try, instead of upping your lot size IMMEDIATELY once your balance is certain amount, rather wait for par SAR to change direction, THEN up your lot size if you want because I've seen in lots of backtests that when SAR is about to change over there are some trades which will end in negative (even if a small amount), one DOESN'T really know HOW long the trend is going to last this is why i say ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1) don't quote me as scripture here, I just think is good idea  
Hope this helps  
(The way I see it, doesn't matter WHAT indicators you use whether MA's, CCI, or WHATEVER, SOMEWHERE you'll get loss, and this method I think IS about the easiest and you'll score pips in the market), you'll just have huge draw down that's it)

My question is this.   
  
I had developed a trading style that the Firebird EA can basically take over for me but instead of 1 setting like open trade every 40 pips (300 pip SL) take profit at 300 pips. I need a matrix of settings (up to 8-10 settings opening and closing trades at the same time).  
  
Such as open every 10 pips close every 25. open every 20 pips, close on 40 pips, open every 40 pips close on 200 pips, open every 50 close on 50, open every 20 close on 20, open every 50 close on 300, open every 100 close on 400, open every 200 close on 600, open every 300 close on 800.  
  
Some of those are not exact settings but to show what i had in mind to take advantage of the main trend as well as smaller fluctuations and ranging markets. Can anyone program those changes to the firebird to meet these needs or has anything similar been done yet?  
  
Much thanks. I do not program, wish i did. But can someone help with those changes?  
  
Warm Regards
