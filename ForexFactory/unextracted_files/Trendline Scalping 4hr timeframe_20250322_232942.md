Guys i have a method which has been very successful for me which i wish to share with everyone else. basically its trend-line trading on a 4hr time-frame. I win 8/10 of these trades and they happen a couple of times a week.  
rules:  
dont trade 1hour before or after heavy economic news.   
Trade only during Euro start to about 3 hours before New York end.  
Look for a bullish trendline on the 4hr timeframe. After the second leg retracement buy when the price hits the line again.  
  
tp is 50pips  
sl is 50pips.  
  
The screen shots attached are examples of this setup  
The first one is of a buy setup the second is of a sell setup.   
In the first pic the trend is confirmed by the first two legs. a bounce of this gradient on a third time confirms a buy.  
Any questions let me know  
  
  
****************UPDATE*********************  
Attached is my Neural Net client for this system, please read the readme file.  
  
How it works  
it works on all platforms with 1-click execution orders.  
how it works is it connects to my main nnhost which lists the trades. the trades will be visible through the nnclient and you can choose to autoexecute them if you wish. The way it autoexecutes is via mouse clicks and remembering where the buy and sell buttons are on your one click order window. so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that trade and auto trade it(when it hits the line on the 3rd bounce) if they choose. if you dont want to autotrade it you can just use it to view which trades i will be taking.  
  
Trades are only for this method described in this thread.  
Once connected it will auto update itself with upcoming trades  
  
I have also tried a screen video though teh quality is pretty bad so i have included in a text file what is on the screen.   
Youtube URL:

Inserted Video

  
apologies for the clarity i didnt have time to learn camtasia  
  
Enjoy!

Fresh, New and Nce!!!!! I trade price action using TL and fib patterns, so i'll be interested in following this thread.  
  
But, kindly give more detailed explanation on what you do[how you determine a bounce off the TL, what candle formations you look at, which of the TL you consider-inner,outer, long term TL, etc], which pairs you trade., how long have you been using this method, and give your trading time period using GMT  
Thanks.

sorry dude ill post a more detailed screenshot shortly.   
  
How i determine a bounce?  
i look for the low on a bull market, i wait for a retrace, then once the retrace has ended and starts heading bullish again(and stays away from the retracement level for more than 8hrs) i consider this to be the second leg of the trendline. i will then draw my gradient line on these two legs and buy on the 3rd touch. New screenshots shortly to come..

Hi all, I am also using this type of trade on any timeframe and am starting to trust it more because these ones seem to work without too much of the dreaded drawdown associated with usual breakout trades. I don't use a fixed TP because I want to be more greedy and more precise. For my initial TP, I Place a Fib from the top of the first candle (for a short trade) in the "3 in a line" setup and the bottom of the fib on the bottom of the 3rd candle. My TP is the 132% extension (+spread for a short) This is the most guaranteed target. If you want to get greedier, I look to see if this target point would naturally trigger another Fib trade (i.e., breaks another swing low or candle low). In this case it triggers the pink Fib - see second pic, whose 132% ext is at 0.8454 and a profit could have been taken there. You notice that it makes a retrace at the 138.2% at 0.8450 and came up to just touch the new TL (Yellow) without breaking it, so I shorted it again there!!! The new target will be the 132% ext of the yellow Fib at 0.8437+ spread...  
  
Regards and pips to all, Chris  
  
PS: Anyone watching this live will see that my greed has got the better of me again and stopped out my trade. However, there is a new H1 touch of the bigger TL now, so have re-shorted with a new target area of 0.8421 + spread (new yellow fib)- fingers crossed.

chris nice charts! thanks for the screen uploads. great to see that im not the only one that has noticed this pattern. Yes its true can always aim for more pips than 50. Whats your success rate if you don't mind me asking?

I'll suggest David explains his method in details so we could have a better focus on just one method here on this thread...except if he's confirming your method to be the same with his....so we do not have ''method overload'' which eventually only leads to a crash...  
  
Care to answer other questions i asked David?  
  
Thanks for your understanding

ok guys i have added another pic at the top of this thread.  
  
  
The confirmation of the gradient legs are labeled 123 for both bullish and bearish trends.  
  
so the time elapsed between the legs is usually greater than 8hrs. when the price moves away from the second leg say for example a bullish trend it will move upwards.. it will move somewhat a hundred or so pips stay around that mark or increase for a period greater than 8hrs then when it the price comes back down and touches the gradient line(drawn by the first two confirmation legs) you buy(or sell if its a bearish trend)

Why would you need permission? You wrote it, and presumably you didn't use any proprietary content, so upload away. The source code to the .exe would certainly make it easier to make sure there are no security threats, if you don't mind of course.

Took a USDCHF 4hr trade today and it paid off. I entered short at the opening of the candle after the bounce candle [highlighted with the yellow eclipse and labelled 3]. first chat  
  
stop loss = the top of the bounce candle formation + 20pips[buffer]  
TP1= the no of pips between the top of the bounce candle formation   
and the opening candle  
  
I then adjusted my trendline as necessary. as shown in the second chart..

Excellent work buddy! thats pretty much all there is to it. very successful method of trading applied to all pairs and all timeframes(i have had best success with 4hr)... its also a part of my neural-net which has added to my success..

A set up in the making for GBPUSD 4hr tf[will complete in the next 3hrs]BOE interest rate news would have seattled by then.  
  
If the present candle ends up bouncing off the TL, then we might have a signal....if not, look forward to the next Trend line[outer trendline]  
  
N:B  
A present 1HR signal is doing marvellously well

certainly looks like a setup though having a look at the gbpusd the first bull confirmation of the three leg setup occurred on the 20th of may. i only usually take one long trade per gradient confirmation and it looks like the gbp has been bullish since this date. Doesnt meen to say that this trade wont work out looks like its def finding some resistaance at this level just the more trades you take on a trend the less likely they perform. price for me currently on gu is 1.5134.  
you taking this trade?

quote is gbpyjpy on 4hr time-frame.. no not an mt4 ea but a c++ neural-net which i coded a while back ill upload the client hopefully by the end of the weekend though it doesn't just take 4hrtrendline trades it looks for others aswell(equally as successful)

EURJPY set up for a SHORT signal.. daily time frame is setting up, so also is the 4hr tf which has actually given a short signal Entry @ 112.10 for a 56 pips target. Aggressive traders might come in at the 4hr tf [not doing too well now, but might actually be a better entry for those just seeing it now], while conservative traders might want to wait for the daily tf signal for further confirmation.  
  
Sorry i cant post charts now, i'm not on my ''analysis'' system.. will do so as soon as i can.  
  
N.B.  
  
All signals traded went well yesterday

Back on my PC now.. let me post my charts..  
  
First is the 4hr tf, Second is the daily tf... The 4hr tf is at a S/R zone, which makes it a high probability turn around..will still look to trade the daily if all things work well...

If guys are interested, we can set up a live trading room where we all see and perhaps take trades together live and direct..  
  
Posting here on the forum can be challenging atimes, hence late posting and infact, i dont get to post all of my trades here.... What do you say Dave? Its your thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Whats your suggestion for the room, i will definately be uploading my neuralnet client soon i just need to make some adjustments to the source before uploading to FF. It lists all the upcoming trades for this method and has teh ability to buy and sell for you if selected, otherwise it will just display what price to enter and the rest is upto you.  
  
It also lists other trades which i take(though an option to disable their displayment is available)  
  
what do you think of this?

its difficult to spot , identify the trades at exact time manually. we need some software to help us on this, otherwise we may miss some trades. hopefully davids indicator will help us.  
  
its a good idea to have a chatroom ...

well, with a little practise, you'll be able to spot, identify and take trades manually with ease..notwistanding, am not against the use of 'robots' if it suits you..personally i dont use any... [I trade price fib patterns, monitor 24 pairs and i spot my trades manually....] perhaps Davids neuralnet might succeed in changing my mind about use of robots..lol

guys heres a screenshot of the neuralnet. sorry i havnt uploaded the full code yet, still tweaking the code and i havnt had much free time as i am moving houses..  
As you can see it shows trades in realtime, theres an option for autoexecution for when the price reaches that level, this can be disabled.  
THeres an option for audio alert which plays a chime when enabled.  
Also other trades i take can be displayed if wished(also can be disabled)  
  
let me know what you guys think of the gui  
  
cheers

Hello David,  
  
Thanks for the thread and your interest to share your trading methods with all of us. I look forward to seeing your c++ code for your neuralnet. Could you post the code as a beta version or something while you still work to make the code better? I would great if you could also upgrade .exe version as well.  
  
cheers

Welcome to a new week.. I just want to scan thru my charts and post possible trades that might happen this week...  
  
Start with GbpUsd..4hr tf  
  
Market broke the up trendline which indicates a high likely hood of the market falling and good enough we have a down TL (blue line) already with a 1,2 point..so here i'll patiently wait for a retest of the TL for a good SHORT signal.

yes you are correct, its a very good system by itself. if we add confluence then it becomes more powerful.  
  
there are several flavors of the same system.  
  
1\. on 3rd occurance, i immediately place a order in the direction of rebounce.  
  
2\. on 4th and higher occurance, i wait for the current bar to close in our direction and i place a limit order at close +5 buffer, with stop as bar low + buffer and tp as recent swing high/low - buffer  
  
3\. on 3rd or higher occurance if TL is broken, then i wait for a retrace to 50% of bar and place order away from TL. that means if TL is broken from top to botom, then SHORT.

Nop i dont use 50/50 SL/TP as dave, does...i calculate my TP1 and SL differently[posted how on page 1 i think]...some use fib ratios.  
  
Actually i trade price/fib patterns and i calculate my tp based on resistance/support levels, fib extension, and sometimes just 'guts'

Target hit on EurJpy.. The pair still has more room to move down..but on this strategy am out because this is a high probability trade, i risk so much of my equity [wont say how much] and scale out quickly..56pips isnt bad to start the week with, especially when you are more than 5% up on your account..lol  
  
Next pair am watching is EurChf short..will post chart later..

Hi Roundrock  
  
I think 4H, zoom out and have a look at the trend line from 21st May 2010.  
  
By the way Dliberators, I like the simplicity and high probability of this system. Thanks for sharing mate.

drawing trendlines is kind of like an artwork. i hope to have some new screeens uploaded soon along with my code.. I spent hours each day watching the market for an entire year(6-8hrs a day) which enabled me to spot this. This is how i developed this method..  
  
so yeh its kind of an artwork but an easy artwork ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

Hi Dave and the guys out there.I want to say a word of appreciation to David for this simple and efficient system.The catch is in its simplicity.  
Regarding the trading room or chat room,I think chat room is simpler.All everybody needs is a Skype ID.  
To all following,I say,have a pips filled week

thats the way to go buddy..your set up looks perfect to me...though i would have waited for the last candle to close and show a bullish bounce off the TL..am usually careful when i see a bearish candle in a long set up..this is an aggressive approach you have though and will give more pips than my approach..but also more dangerous..lol  
  
I'm attaching a link to where you can access a little write up i did on How to draw trendlines...hope this will be of help to someone out there

do you wait for this candle to close as green before you enter ? or wait for next candle to close above TL to enter ? or you will enter on touching TL without a confirmation ?

I actually dont trade 1hr with this system, just posted this for those who do...i do wait for candle to close before taking trades... a candle's story is not complete until it closes..using this as an example, i'll prefer to wait for the candle to close as bullish candle off the TL...and that did not happen.. so no trade and price proved us right.

david486, thanks for the chart  
  
it looks like all the legs are so close on the gradient. i read one rule (for 4h) that the 3rd leg should be atleast 8 hrs after 2nd leg. here i am seeing 2nd, 3rd legs are consiquitive bars.

i would tend to agree. its only $1 a pip for me on this trade. nothing in comparison to my standard lot size.

well exit +10pips not so bad. but shows must always be vigilant on entries. even seasonal traders like me can enter too late.

What about this ? already EJ was shorted recently by D liberators  
  
is this a valid setup for long if it closes above TL and starts showing some bullishness ?

From your chart, can see there's been a 3rd leg on that gradient before and if you'd taken the trade would av been profitable..  
  
What i'm having on my chart is diffrent ([FxPro](/brokers/fxpro "View FxPro Broker Profile"))..still watching the pair for a signal

guys i also have a bit of dilemma. i want to post the exact levels to trade at on a scalp gradient(within the neuralnet client) though i cant give a specific rate as when the price hits the gradient again there is no specific rate.. what i can do is tell you exactly where the first two legs are. I am thinking of also adding other fx pairs  
please let me know your ideas as i will be releasing the first version shortly and i wish to incorporate everything..

Hi all  
  
I am sure many of you are probably aware of this one.....but just in case, this one is looking as a potential set up.

aud/cad looks like its expired(second last candle already bounced) would of been successful by the looks of it.  
  
gu looks valid.  
  
good work. your getting the hang of it!

Hi David, I don't understand your last post. On ACad I am waiting for the current 4hr candle to close. If it is a bull candle, then I will enter long. The second to last candle was a bear candle and only bounced about 7 or 8 pips.  
  
Don't we wait for candle close before entering a trade?

hey fourkids and thanks for your post.  
  
on my charts it shows a direct price bounce of the trendline as it does with yours. i dont wait for any particular candle to form on the third bounce to make a purchase decision i just enter(except if there is pending news coming out).  
  
however this doesnt mean you shouldnt, if that makes you more comfortable then by all means...

Ok Thanks. Does that mean the second to last candle which bounced for a few pips was the 3rd bounce and now the set up is invalid?

hey, Four Kids, coincidentally, I was also looking at these two pairs, here are my charts  
  
GU, I am looking into TP of 1.5200. currently, set stoploss to BE  
AC, still with uptrend, TP might be 0.9100  
  
just a different view for discussion. TL is very difficult to trade with, but, it seems one of the most useful tool, according to Al Brooks (I am currently reading his book, very interesting). however, still trying hard to find a solution to use it effectively

On the contrary, TL remains one of the easiest tools to trade with, all you need is to know how to draw a valid TL and get used to it...  
  
I've seen a lot of wrongly drawn TL [even in this thread] and more often than not, you get your fingers burnt when you draw TL wrongly...  
  
I'm yet to have a loosing trade on my TL based strategies for this month... You can get a simple, easy to follow write up on how to draw an effective TL on page 2 or there about of this thread.....   
  
Happy Pipping

Hello david486, do I think right that you are not awaiting third touch/bounce candle to be closed before enter? thx

you are correct, others do wait for the closure i dont. doesnt mean its wrong basically whatever works for you. i used to miss a few trades when waiting for the closure candle. The Closure candle is also a good way to enter.  
  
**update neural GUI**  
  
ok so this i what i have configured so far.  
listbox view with trend line setups, per entry there is also a checkbox where if checked alongside autotrade(while setup properly) it will execute the trade automatically.. This is for my neural app for those who are new. The source code will be upp'd aswell, im not going to lie its very messy but it will work 100% ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

if you were referring the first to the GU chart, it is a trade into a retest of trendline, probabily a bit weird though

In my view and experience so far, they are actually not the same...to avoid distraction and unnecessary confussion, i suggest we stick to posting charts or trades that has to do with the strategy as described by the thread starter... I do see a lot of wonderful threads that get clustered and confusing after a while just because other traders post what is not in line with the thread's strategy...This system is highly effective as simple as it is described by Dave, and i'm sure we dont want to give this thread a premature death..just my own view..

Hi Four kids   
  
My chart looks a bit different (different broker and GMT settings I guess).  
  
Cheers

I missed the the initial bounce, but decided to enter anyway. Got in at 135.37. 2nd part stopped out at break even.  
  
If I had of entered at the initial bounce, 50to 60 pips would have been banked, and the second part would still be open.

driftwood, i apologise about that! if your refering to my entry upon the third bounce some like a confirmation candle before entering. i personally enter as soon as the price his the line. my method is a bit riskier though i dont miss trades.

Hi All,  
This is my first post on here. I have been watching this thread with interest and took the plunge last night on the USD/CHF 4hr chart. I went short with a 40/40 stop/limit. Collected my pips in a couple of hours so thanks guys.

hi david, congrats on the five star rating (to d lib and others too)  
  
i have seen you are tracking only GBPJPY. is there any reason for not tracking other pairs ?

d lib, call your broker. im afraid this is the problem trading with some market makers. as sson as they see a trend of profitability with a client the execute stops etc. thoguh it could be just a mistake, how long have you been with them?? if its malice on their part they should be reported..

Hello guys..am looking at the UsdJpy for a likely LONG trade.. to back this likely trade up is the fact that there's daily support at the 87.25 zone which is close to the TL..

ouch..yes i see.i was lucky my broker price didn't reach my stop..  
  
still cant believe what d libs broker did. such a scumbag move. anyways there will be more trades to come.   
  
can anytone tell me what their success is like on other pairs. i have only been trading gbp/jpy?  
i would like to know because by monday the neural should be released and i might add a few other pairs for those that are keen. for less liquid stocks a tp and sl of 50 pips will have to be reduced to like 20 or 30. anyways let me know your thgouhts.

D liberators, i didnt know that each gradient can be traded only once and thats 3rd leg  
  
is there any reason for this ? the more and more price toyches TL it becomes weak or strong ? my understanding is if TL has several legs, it gets stronger, rather than just joining 2 points. but i need a good swing between each leg. the bigger the swing, better it is for TL

Though i cant see it very well.. looks ok to me [thats the ideal TL..having the full ABCD leg. The TL used in this strategy is not necessarily the textbook TL..some cases you are actually anticipating the CD leg...  
  
You may want to go thru the little note i wrote on how to effectively/correctly draw an ideal TL. And when we eventually get the chart/trading room going, you can be sure of getting a step by step walk thru on how to draw a TL.

Any update on the skype room? I just stumbled across this thread and i have been trading a very similar technique. There's nothing better than trend lines IMO. Looking forward to learning and contributing.

David et al,  
  
Price, on the 3rd touch, actually broke through the TL by about 39 pips. Did this overshoot invalidate the setup? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f914.png?v=15.1)  
  
Currently, price is moving back towards the TL, and has almost reached it. Do we ignore the original setup and draw a new TL based on the new lowest low? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

David thanks for this system. I've been reading and watching it here while testing it. Most of my questions have been asked by others so far. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate you sharing it and also thanks to everyone else for sharing their trading and charts. It's all so very informative.   
It's very good to see others who are willing to share a good system without wanting to sell it.

i agree with you tnfxtrader. i have never seen such success in forex, lol i fall in the classic 95% of retail losers.. since i have been reading this thread there's been a complete reversal with my account. i think 80-90% accuracy is damn good and thats what i have seen.  
So thank you David and D lib and all those who shared their charts. Look forward to trading this week.

Hey there David,  
  
I just looked at your thread for the first time and noticed your neural net effort. I'm experimenting with NN myself so I'll subscribe and have a look when you post it. BTW I'm a C++ programmer myself for my day j.o.b. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Thanks for your doc, D'liberators! It's very helpful! :-)  
  
I thought I had an ABCD indy on my pc before, but I can't locate it. I did find this indy for trendlines. I hope it helps! For those experienced TL users/drawers, please let me know if this will suffice for drawing TL's.

its the most accurate tp and sl for this pair. you can factor in the spread if you like to make it 1:1 i just like a round number

I'm glad with this thread. may I join here to discuss together? my style trading is use trendline and price action with 4hr timeframe. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
now, if we see GBP/USD and EUR/USD, I guess they are possitive bullish..

Hi guys!  
  
Very nice trade you all have in here.   
  
I am very interested in this thread because all you guys give the TLs the same importance to the manual trading as me. This is one of the few trades I can sayI have read completely (as it is the first one I arrived few days from its beginning hehe). Neverthless, I got one doubt: how do you decide when to enter? I ask this because I am feeling confused regarding that, as sometimes by analyzing the charts posted, I see there is no need to wait any bullish-bearish candlestick to take the trade once price gets to the TL, but other times some traders wait for them.  
  
In the first post, I can read that with the touch it is enough to take the trade. Thus, is this the rule the beginners with this strategy shall follow?  
  
Btw, are there any plans of opening a trading room? If there are any problems, I believe that skype should be enough for now, opening a new conversation and start inviting lots of people ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)   
  
Thanks a lot!  
Jed

If you missed this....no probs. just wait for the conservative approach![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
  
You can also use the conservative approach on 1hr time frame for an early entry on this.

on EU, there was a trade..signal on 4hr, but used the conservative entry style on 1 hr which also gave sweet pips...However, i'll still look for long opportunities as price approach the outer TL.

I think you'll need to go thru it again....AUDUSD [2nd trade] is still in trade for me..though not green yet..  
  
I also used the 1hr entry approach i posted lately and that closed my first trade at 50+.....

This is my first post here, I have been observing and taking a few trades. Excellent work being done here, I love it.  
  
ACAD good confluence at a pivot zone and a 50 Fib retracement.   
  
I do believe David trades are taken as touch of trendline ?(I stand corrected if I am wrong.)

Missed taking this trade with my new found entry style which should bring me close to Dave's..  
  
Should have zoomed on 4hr tf and use my conservative method..actually there was a signal on the 4hr..oooooo what a miss!!!!!!

guys what a crazy day! 2 of my gy trades were triggered by my neural net(on seperate dedicated server) netting me 100+pips..  
  
i have been moving and havnt had access to propper charts so sorry for the lack of posts.  
  
sum it up the first one broke the trendline by about 30 pips then completely reversed.this was a long trade..  
  
the second one hit 133.18 then shorted for >50 pips almost to the pip.  
  
i hope to post charts soon, well done to those who made.  
  
p.s there is some confusion with entries. I enter as soon as the price hits the trend. Others enter when there is a confirmation candle. Both ways are good, the second is more conservative. The second entry method was dev'd by D liberators.

There's been a third bounce on this gradient. so trade with caution...  
I'll prefer to wait for a bounce on the next TL as shown in the chart

guys here are the charts for the 2 trades taken mentioned above.  
  
  
the bull trend is marked by the pink underlines and the bear trend by the yellow.  
  
with the yellow you can see the 3rd mark hit and broken through. this is because its on a 4hr timeframe. if you drop bak to the 15min or so you can see that it broke the   
133.18 mark by a couple of pips then shorted for more than 50 pips(i only took 50)  
  
the bull trend marked by the blue lines shows on the 3rd bounce it broke the trend and continued in a negative direction for 30 or so pips before completely reversing. Both trades successful. i know the eur/jpy trade some people were looking at would of been good to. hope all got in on these two, once again apologies for not posting charts as i have been moving.

hi david, i have a question on the trendlines. we need to connect the low / high of the waves ? if i get a high then i need to wait for a low and reverse and get another high. if we connect the highs of such waves then we will get a good trendline. just connecting highs of consiquetive bars (or alternate bars) is not proper. in my EJ chart i dont see any wave. that looks a bad trade  
  
thanks again for pointing this out

what i meant by your charts are off is that your candles are alot different to mine and therfor get different/incorrect trends. that e/j trade you took on my chart the two legs were one 5 pips in value difference from each other. That is a support resistance line, a completely different tradeable method. your trendline drawing looks pretty good though its just that your charts are off.

only for a set pair. though the pairs can be changed on the fly if needed  
  
for now i have gy as the standard and i have two more spots. if need be i could upgrade this. this incorporates both short and long trades for each pair added.  
  
i can change to 6 pairs, has the ability for this. but this is just for now..  
  
as for your question on the daily timeframe, not sure, when i trade it(not very often) i use 50 50. this working for you?

Sounds great David...  
  
The 50/50 works but sometimes I notice that i close the trade too early or didnt give it enough room to breath & for the price to turn around and go in the needed direction..so thinking of making it 100/100 as its a daily timeframe

I, too, have been following this thread and am studying how the GY pair acts on a daily basis. Will be shifting to the 4 hour TF now and study it for a while. Great thread. Thanks very much.

this is a short signal though i cannot comment how successful this method is on this pair as i have never traded it. i cant give sl or tp's either.   
my 50 sl and tp is for liquid pairs like gy.  
  
this surge up is caused by very positive retail sales coming out of gbp.  
best to stay out of market around high impact news. i say not to enter 1hr before adn depending if the news deviated heavily from the forcast 1hr after aswell

guys here is a screenshot of the latest neural that i will upload as soon as i see some trades.  
  
the format of line 1 is:  
Trendline1 buy gbp/jpy 1 price leg1: leg2: price | Trendline2 leg1: price leg2: price tp&sl  
second line:  
just has the one direction so if its a buy only buy details on that line.  
  
with the first option can squeeze more pairs into the app  
what do you all think?

Hi all,  
my first post in this thread.  
Nice work and ideas sharing done by everybody, especially thanks to David to have introduced the strategy.  
  
My suggestion to the money management is to identify previous swing high/low level or previous support/resistance area and fix TP at those levels.  
If possible start the operation with 2 lots: close the first lot at first TP and move the stop loss of the second lot to BE and wait for the second TP (or use appropriate TS).

yes this might be good for those who are trading non gy pairs. the 50/50 tp and sl has been working like a charm for me.

Dave,  
  
Thanks for your great strategy. I was trading a very similar way and it's great to find people who are on the same page as me! People tend to overload their charts with indicators and this is pretty much as simple as it gets, yet is highly effective. I'm glad to be in the 5% that win! Looking forward to your NN client. I'm done for the week +214 pips - have a good weekend!

hey roundrock, it works on all platforms with 1-click execution orders.  
how it works is it connects to my main nnhost which lists the trades. the trades will be visible through the nnclient and you can choose to autoexecute them if you wish. The way it autoexecutes is via mouse clicks and remembering where the buy and sell buttons are on your one click order window. so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that trade and auto trade it(when it hits the line on the 3rd bounce) if they choose. if you dont want to autotrade it you can just use it to view which trades i will be taking.  
  
hope this helps

Hey dave, I'm unclear how the program finds trades. Does it somehow look on the chart for trendlines? Right now the program connects and displays "no pending trades, window will autoupdate". I tried drawing trendlines but it doesn't matter.  
  
Also, in the readme.txt file you talk about "trade layouts". Where are these actually specified? Are they stored in a file? Attached to drawn trendlines? 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

Actually if the basic system is trading trendline bounces with a fixed SL/TP then autotrading is fairly straightforward. There are several trendline EAs out there that work pretty well. You just draw the trendline and name it a certain way so the EA can find it. Then when price gets near the trendline the EA enters according to the strategy you select (i.e. limit order at trendline, or bounce of so many pips after touching the trendline.)  
  
I don't quite see what a NN gets you.

I dont have to stare at charts, draw trendlines and screw around with an EA. Thats the advantage.

I understand the sentiment, but drawing trendlines on an H4 chart and running an EA to catch the trend continuations might require 4 hours/week at the most.

What exactly is the point you are trying to make...discredit the NN?  
You are advocating the use of an EA..the thread owner is givng what he has been using sucessfuly..are both not automated trading in a way? so i wonder what the fuss is all about...  
  
Let's be constructive and add value to things rather than draw up unnecessary argument..if you have a point to make, pls make it without drawing a bad air of someone else...NN has not even been tested yet and its already been attacked....perhaps you are one of the ''big boys''..lol

Far from it. I have yet to see a NN that actually works consistently for trading, that's all. I'm looking forward to hearing how the NN actually works. I'm just leery of black box implementations, that's all.  
  
The OP's original system is good, however. My suggestion of trading it with EA isn't far-fetched. It's not fully automatic since you have to keep drawing trendlines. So it's up to you what trends you see. The EA would just initiate trades and manage them based on your hand-drawn trendline.

ok guys first of all here's how my nnhost works. it scans my datafeed provided by reuters api and bloomberg api. It then draws these trendline and plots trades accordingly. when the price hits the level of the third bounce it will generate a sell signal or buy signal. Now i cant be running the nnhost on every machine or from my laptop because i will have to install bloomberg and reuters and quite frankly it will congest my hardware and make everything a hassel.  
my solution was the nnclient(nothing like the one i have released for ff).  
The nnclient you see now is basically the same as i had for myself but is tweaked for ff(and made the gui a whole lot nicer).  
  
I have been using this method for 5 years but have been using my nn for around 3. I have been successful this entire time.  
steevegee58, this isnt just a blackbox system. I do understand where you are coming from. My method is clearly outlined in this thread and thats how my host plots its lines(not based on some random magic algorithm). sure there is an ea to do do something similar but the ea's enter blindly. my host takes news into account(when i have it flagged to do so). Not just that, i dont use mt4 for my broker, how would i enter such trades on a non mt4 account? This is unversal for all brokers with 1click execution.  
  
I would suggest testing on a demo account firstly.  
  
The client has room for 6pairs so my next pair in line is most likely ej. i only trade gy so if anyone has any suggestions that would be good.

thanks for that fguru, have you traded these with any success? tp and sl will also have to be adjusted so i will watch over them or if anyone else has been trading these 2 pairs what sl and tp's ahve you been using? the 50pip sl and tp i use for the gy is only good for fast moving fx pairs..  
  
appreciate the feedback

The way it autoexecutes is via mouse clicks and remembering where the buy and sell buttons are on your one click order window. so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that trade and auto trade it(when it hits the line on the 3rd bounce)...

ok david, got it. thanks for the explanation. its something like it records your button execution, writes its scripts and remembers it and then next time does it automatically. but how about the quantity ? does it take same qty everytime ? also the symbol has to be in same exact location in the window, if it is changed then it will place order for a different pair ? how does it remeber the pair since we have more than 1 pair.  
  
i wrote something like this AUTOIT, for my broker for stocks. it works great !!

Thanks for your explanation, it was quite interesting. So the reuters and bloomberg datafeeds are for knowing when news events are coming to avoid entry?  
  
I'm learning about NNs now and experimenting with them. What are the inputs to the NN and how many neurons and layers are there?

hey roundrock, i have used software which works similar to this 2. basically it records the exact location on the screen for where the buy and sell buttons are. if you move the order window it will just click whatever is behind the order window -probably just empty space or a chart. Going from the readme file you will have to set up the buy/sell everytime you open the program or every time the checkbox is unticked.  
  
as for stop loss, take profit and lot size this is determined by you. You may want to open a oco order where you can specify the sl and tp as for the order size this is defined by you.  
I have cell message notification on my broker so when i get the message i will log in via my iphone and will set my tp and sl if im out..  
  
pretty darn good setup dave, this must of took you a while.. appreciate all you have done for us ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) im already more successful than i ever was because of your method.

Gee!..... I hate to be a pain in the you know where.....however I am not sure if I followed the correct steps. I have the fxdavenn window open, it currently says No Pending trades. Window will auto update. ( I have the box at the beginning of the sentence checked)......I hope that's it.  
  
Just wondering if someone could confirm that with me.  
  
Many thanks

ezzy, all that is is just a notice to say there are no trades yet generated. as soon as a trade is generated that line will be replaced with for example   
"BUY GY TL1 L1: 135.35 L2:135.55 50/50"(only an example)  
if you have the checkbox ticked make sure you setup the co-ordinates of the buy/sell buttons correctly. watch the vid if not sure.

There was a nice short on the USDCHF. I tried a trailing stop, but it took me out too early for my liking as i left a lot of pips on the table.

I've found trailing hurts the performance of the various systems I've traded. It feels good psychologically because you seem to be reducing risk. In reality you're increasing the chances of an early stop-out and not letting the trade run. 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

news indicator for consumer sentiment came out way better than expected for the gbp....... forcast was 2 and the actul was 33.. this could impact our trade i take it.

hello Ezzy, i think that price is leg 1.   
If i am right leg 1 = 1st touch, leg 2 = 2nd touch and leg 3 = 3rd touch =entry. May be i am not right. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f937-200d-2642-fe0f.png?v=15.1)

yes i just got an alert on my phone so i jumped on my pc.. the forcast for the news was 2 the actual was like 33 or something. very bad for the trade. this indicator never impacts the market so hmm...  
  
This is a good reason to stay out of market if there is news, even orange news can stuff up a good trade.  
  
if it breaks the support of 77 i would say exit all

That's not really true, unless you're only opening trades on the bar open.  
  
There's generally a bar forming during a news event. You wait for any trendline traversal during news to resolve itself before entry while the bar is forming.  
  
Also, you draw the trendline on the H4 chart but you could still look for entry on a lower timeframe as long as it involves the H4 trendline. 

You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

The forecast was 2 the actual was 33 - however there is a little star on the detail button on the ff news page. It states "Source changed series calculation formula as of this release;" I'm assuming thats the reason for the large difference between forecast and actual.

Well guys, its been nice actively participating here... I wont be active here for some time to come now..Need to concentrate on some other things [i'm a forex commando and on a new assignment..lol]. I'll log on most of the time 'cause my personal laptop is configured to automatically log on, but i wont be able to actively participate...since there's a trading machine for everyone now, i guess there wont be much of confusion anymore...I'll still like sm1 to put me thru how to load the ''machine'' on my pc please...  
  
Wish you all a sucessful trading with this strategy or system or whatever....  
  
P.S. I still need sm1 to help code my EMA cut strategy into an EA...

Hi David,  
I restarted the Metatrader platform and then your NN client: the first picture immediately and the second one after 5 min.

Hi guys First post on here, I have been trading trendlines with additional support, so I like the idea here. Question for dave 486 did'nt you say in one of the posts that for a 3rd bounce of a trendline inorder to take the trade you should wait for a few 4H candles before taking the trade for the 3rd bounce is this correct? as the current trade on USD/CAD the 3rd bounce was right after the the 2nd bounce ie the very next candle. I appologise if I have misinterpreted this.

> Hi guys First post on here, I have been trading trendlines with additional support, so I like the idea here. Question for dave 486 did'nt you say in one of the posts that for a 3rd bounce of a trendline inorder to take the trade you should wait for a few 4H candles before taking the trade for the 3rd bounce is this correct? as the current trade on USD/CAD the 3rd bounce was right after the the 2nd bounce ie the very next candle. I appologise if I have misinterpreted this.

hey kdx welcome. no if i did type that it was a mistake could you show me the post.  
what i would of meant is there should be a couple of 4hr candles between the first 2 legs, after the 2nd leg if the price touches the trendline drawn from the first two legs this is considered to be the 3rd touch/entry

Thanks for that David, I'm with you totally yes I misunderstood the gap as you mentioned ie the candles needs to be between the first two candles, I read most of the thread over the weekend so should have checked again before posting. The neurl client is excellent by the way. Lastly if you are still using the skype room could you kindly add me my id is : kdx205

no problem sam.  
  
l1 is the leg 1 price l2 is the leg2 price. so you draw a trendline from these two prices starting from the leg1 price and you will get the trend. so sell when it hits the trendline formed by leg1 and leg2 stop loss 30 tp 30

im removing the aud trade from the nn, i personally traded this and made 9 pips though the fibre connection to my server wehre my nnhost is was cut and got disconnected for a fair few hours.. i took the break in the asian session just testing how the aud performs during its native session. by the time it got to the eur session which is the recommended timeframe for trading this method it would of broken and would of made this trend invalid.  
  
ill check the markets now for anymore trades accross the pairs

new gy short sell. i havnt got auto execute enabled for this if you want me to enable it let me know and i will. please also take into account the news.  
also only take the short if the next candle or greater, not the current candle hits the line which will make a 3rd bounce.

Thank you for sharing your idea Mr. David.  
I need your explanation on the below set up.  
TL1: sell gbp/jpy L1: 137.52 L2: 136.86 50/50  
  
8:00am 29/JUL/2010 that is when that set u show, and immediately the price hit the TL that setup show. So what is the interpretation of that? and when exactly do i enter the trade? is it immediately the alert show or when that present candle finished? Please more explanation on this.

lL1 = leg1 value L2 = leg2 value so you draw a line from leg1 to leg2 when price hits the trend again you sell. the autotrade feature i have disabled for the week because im testing other pairs.

Hi David  
  
Discovered your system yesterday and decided to try it out. I'm 130 pips in profit as at 16:00 BST today, so to say that I am impressed is an understatement.  
  
I've been learning about trading for almost two years and have tried many systems, and I do mean 'many' Up until now I have focussed on short time frames (5 min to 15mins) thinking that they would suit my style and be more applicable to my future as a day trader. However, I am now begining to realise that longer time frames actually work bett and are more reliable.  
  
So I would like to thank you for posting this system and may the pips be with you... ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
GG

Question 1:  
Should "yes" appeared on [Successfull] column once E/J is valid to trade? Or what is the condition for "yes" to appear?  
  
Question 2:  
USD/CAD  
L1.0254 L2:1.0298 as shown on post #466 is indicated for Line 1 (drawn according to NN).  
However, Line 2 should consider valid buy entry? If yes should NN update it? I did restart my MT4 + NN but remain for U/CAD.  
  
Do I miss any?

then by looking at the charts USDCAD from wensday was invalid as 2 and 3rd are hit one candle after the other just like the GBPJPY chart i posted. so why is one valid and other not

no the usd/cad trade was valid. the first and second legs had more than 1 candle between them the gy 1 candle hit then the one after hit on the next candle which makes the second candle invalid. the 3rd hit you see on the charts is counted as the second hit.

Hi David. I need your help on the question below  
  
USD/CAD  
L1:1.0254 L2:1.0298 as shown on post #466 is indicated for Line 1 (drawn according to NN).  
However, Line 2 should consider valid buy entry? If yes should NN update it? I did restart my MT4 + NN but NN stay remain for U/CAD since 28/Jul. My problem could be same as Ezzy (post #421)?  
  
Do I miss any?  
  
Sam

i think you have mis interpreted dave's earlier posts which describe the format of the lines. leg1: price leg2: price  
you draw the line from leg1 price to leg2 price. not a seperate line for each leg. the line which you have labelled as line2 is the product of leg1 and leg2. as you can see the bounce of the 3rd hit on the line created a buy signal which was profitable. i traded this line according to the nn and daves rules and made pips.

This is how it looks on my MT4 ([forex.com](/brokers/forexcom "View FOREX.com Broker Profile")).  
All three trades would have been very successful.  
USD/CHF did not trigger.

You are absolutely right john19r. I made a mistake! I have attached the EUR/JPY chart again, now it should be correct. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
No, unfortunately I did not take any of the trades, as I forgot to open the neural client in the morning. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f62b.png?v=15.1)

tazca, your gbp/jpy chart is correct but there was no 3rd bounce. looks like a difference in the data feed between fxdd and your broker.  
your chart is drawn correctly though and if you did take that trade it would of been profitable. where the red arrow is pointing down this would classify as the 3rd bounce according to the screenshot in post #481

This would have been another valid trade, right?

I guess really what i am missing is how you determain where leg one is on the chart cause there is so many place where you could put leg one and have leg 2 already there and be waiting on leg3 to form.

I am looking for a clear trend, either up or down. For example when I see an uptrend I put my leg 1 on the lowest point of a bull candle. Then I count 5-7 candles and there I put my second leg. Then I wait for the next candle and most likely this will be leg 3 - the trigger leg.  
  
I have studied the successful setups/trades we had so far and often the second leg was 5-7 candles after the first leg and the trigger leg (3) one candle after leg 2. Maybe just coincidence, I dont know.

After "Buy" for EJ realised the candle is yet close for 3rd bounce. According to the thread should only trade on next candle open after 3rd bounce candle close. Please correct me if am wrong. Am I plotting the chart correctly?

Morning  
  
I have a question relating to the nn as follows:  
How long will the trade stay notified on the nn after the entry point is passed? for example, I just opened up the nn at about 07:30 BST and notice 3 trades. But I cant seem to get the TL points as indicated?  
Am I doing something wrong?

I'm using IBFX (MT4) on 4 hr timeframe.  
  
Think I'm getting the hang of locating the TL points, but would still like to know how long the trades remain on the nn after the entry point has passed?  
  
Thanks

ibfx is intorducting broker for mbtrading if im correct. their charts are from their own liquidity pool. use fxdd charts demo is free and its the same for live.

_I mean_ the FOREX DAVE NEURAL CLIENT software that i download from this thread. presently, I'm seeing (eur/jpy no trade) and (usd/cad no trade), so when will i know when there will be trade on them? and will it be immediately your software detect the signal that is shows here?

I've been using the nn.....forgot to say thanks. Only demoing at the moment, but really enjoying it.  
  
Once again, many thanks.

yes it means exactly what it says. when it updates it updates in real time. so under the successful tab if there is a yes or a no(you will see a yes for the aud) it means the trade has come and gone and was successful, the other two havnt triggered yet. just draw the trendlines on a chart and you will see if they have been triggered or not

Hi, anyone take AUD/USD as shown from NN? Do mind sharing your chart and showing the entry point? As I might misunderstand where the entry point should be. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
I did not take this trade as am confusing.

For a down trend, the line connects the highs. For an uptrend, the line connects the lows.

Great thread guys. I'm a new member and have been reading thru the thread and trust to finish by Monday. Thx to all for sharing & hope I can contribute something positive here too. I usually do a personal weekend analysis for Euro & Cable but have been so captivated & impressed by this thread that I decided to forgo my analysis to read thru the thread as I find it very simple and unique.  
  
Cheers, & God bless all

Scalping is a rather specific type of trading. It is opening a position and holding it for anywhere from as little as seconds (which brokers hate and you shouldn't do) to as long as 5 or maybe even 10 minutes.  
  
Most actual "scalping" involves a trade held for between 1 and 3 minutes.  
  
Can someone explain to me exactly how it is that this system, with positions that can be held for several days, is in any way a "scalping" system?  
  
Please don't take my question to mean I'm bashing on you or something ... because that isn't my intention at all. I am simply trying to understand.

mr charlotte have you watched the video? the autotrade works of mouse clicks and the setup is explained in the video. it records on the screen where your buy and sell buttons are and when a sell or buy comes from the host it will click on the locations recorded. this means once setup you cannot move the order window.

several days? most i have held a position with this method is 3hrs, the rest tp's were all hit within the hour. maybe dave can elaborate on why he called the thread trendline scalping. I dont see the importance of the terminology used. i guess if it makes you fell better you could call it swing trading.

toi you can trade all pairs. theres 5(might add another soon)  
ey and gy have autotrade enabled on them, the rest will be manual entries. As for now there are no trades accross the pairs hopefully soon there should be some.

Hi fguru...as per my understanding the 2nd leg should not be the current candle...the trendline should have touched 2 previous highs or 2 previous lows.   
  
David please correct me if i am wrong

guys for all those who are a bit confused here's an example of a gy trade which happened on friday and was listed in the nnclient.  
on the 3rd touch it hit almost to the pip and retracted for a cool 50pips

What do you mean by autotrade enabled on ey and gy? I don't have to set buy/sell (accross my pointer to buy and press b, to sell and press s)?

ok when there is a ey and gy trade you check checkbox next to the trade in the nnclient, select autoclick then setup have your order windows setup for one click execution open then select the text box for the setup for the corresponding pairs and move the mouse over to the buy and sell buttons and press b for buy and s for sell. you do this each for both pairs. a 'set' wll appear when the locations are recorded. did you watch the video?

yes for each pair you need to setup. so individual signals can be received from the server. for example a gbp/jpy buy order might happen 2hours before a eur/jpy buy or sell order

you can continue with other things just aslong as the order windows are still in the same place and not covered by anything. you can just enable the alert and check the status of the nnclient if you need to minimize the windows and enter manually upon hearing the alert

This is one of the most basic concepts of forex trading. It's simple trend line trading where you buy or sell on the 3rd bounce of the trend line. If you find this confusing you're in trouble.

Hi David  
  
I have been following this thread for about two weeks now and have had good results with the methord. However i haven't got how to use the nn, first the videos l don't know what's wrong with my system but l have no audio, its just vissual. Its just this video l have audio for any other video but l don't know why your video have no audio on my system.  
Secondary do l have to run the nn whenever l open the charts? Can't it be linked to the charts such that when ever l open the charts the nn starts running automatically? could l be missing something? I will appreciate your assistance and thanks again for this great system.

Start with this......learn how trend line is drawn...to do that here on this thread, go to the page where there's an attachment on how to draw trendlines..read it over and over again, but more importantly, practise over and over again.

looking for gy and ey setups, these 2 are the only 2 that can be autotraded, will add the other pairs for next weeks session  
  
watch out for the news remember not to enter 1hour before or 1hour after(if the news varied from forcast)

Guys, I missed a wonderful trade (USD/JPY) on DAILY chart because I was too anxious. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44e.png?v=15.1)  
  
I entered the trade at the open of the current daily candle at 86.53 with SL 40 and TP 40. The trade went in the desired direction for 20 pips so I set the SL to +1 and went to bed (I thought better be save than sorry).  
  
Just saw that it hit my SL (+1) while it went up to 86.60 just to go south again for 85 pips! If I wouldnt have moved my SL to +1 but rather to -10 I would have made a very great trade. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f624.png?v=15.1)

here is a screenshot for the two trades on the nn. These will be both autotradeable so have your nnclient setup to autotrade if you wish it to.  
take a look at fguru's charts(2 posts back) for trendline layout

hey fguru i had the same question for dave i asked him earlier this week. he said yes that he starts fresh from the new week because of the new pairs that hes added to quash confusion. said it was easier to run from the begging of the week, results were the same.  
  
so i suppose its up 2 u guys if you want to run it from the beginnign or from a previous week.  
  
sorry forgot to add that on average usually trades are generated on a wednesday due to a new trend forming which he can apply his method to.

toii the nn works of mouse clicks so when setup properly it only knows where the buy/ sell buttons are for the platform. things like lot size, sl and tp will have to be managed by ourselves. it only gets us in the trade.

So all I have to do just set up for the buy n sell button?   
after that, If the trades open, I have to set sl n tp for it?  
I can put a pending order by looking to the nn, right? ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

yeh exactly. oco orders you can specify a tp and a sl. so with @market oco's it will get you in at market price when the nn clicks on the buy or sell then the sl and tp is predefined so if it hits the tp it will close and vise versa for the stop.

ok 2nd touch was 1.0384 that 4hr candle closed as a doji the nxt 4H candle pretty much opened on the TL but entry would have been around 1.0391. I'm using Alpari Uk.  
  
I've also checked odl.[Fxcm](/brokers/fxcm "View FXCM Broker Profile") and 3rd touch there was around 1.0394.

NO!  
L1 and L2 define the TL (trendline). You have to wait for the third touch: when the price touch the TL enter the trade in the direction suggested by the NN client with SL and TP.

Hi guys  
  
Great reading and inputs. Nice work David and very generous of you.  
The reason for my post is a general enquiry about 2 points.  
1) The concept mentioned by John (above) that the 3 hits have been recorded because the 2 middle candles have been on the trend line stikes me as a bit strange. Would you not normall wish for at least a candle gap between to validate the hit? The reason I say this is that it is possible for the No2 to be the close and the number 3 to be the open ergo it is really only one hit.  
2) There appears to be differing charts even with the same timeframes ie several charts with 4h candles appear different. Similar in trend but slightly out when it comes to 'actual' candles open and close. So not hours out it would seem but out none the less. I can also state that my IG markets 4H differs from the ones quoted.  
Has this been identified previously? It would make things rather difficult if we have 2 or 3 different charts for the same TF.  
thanks for any feed back especially if I have this wrong somewhere

dotmag is correct, thanks dotmag for the screenshot. guys have disabled auto execute for the gy. news coming out shortly. hopefully it doesnt ruin this trade entry(remember wont enter if news impacts market and breaks the tl)  
will re-enable at +1hr after news or if news had no impact.

How close to the TL does price have to get before you consider it valid? Are you looking for an actual touch of the TL? or (say) withing a few pips of it?.   
  
I often seem to see price come close, and then shoot off in the direction suggested by the nn and think I should have taken the trade...  
  
thanks

Yes, but there are still some warnings to follow, you can find them in the David's first post, i.e. trade only after EUR session open, don't trade during news etc.  
For example we are waiting right now for a GBP news so don't trade, it's gambling.

gg if you are feeling adventurous and say the price is 5-10 pips from the tl you could take the trade if you wanted to. but you risk entering early. i know what you are talking about with this current gy trade i sore the price hit 42 then retrace within 20mins by 40+ pips.. hehe would of been good if the price hit 50 which is where the tl is then retraced would of been a quick and easy trade. now i guess we just wait for the news to die out.

Hi David etal  
  
May I ask why the European open is so important to trend trading and what news you consider important.   
There was no important news to be released that I was aware of that would greatly affect the GBP?  
Unless you meant the official reserve changes which is major news is it?

the eur to new york sessions are the most liquid. i prefer this time frame  
and as for news gbp had services pmi comine out 1hour and ten mins ago and a few hours before that halifax hpi came out. i now consider red to orange news to avoid.

thanks for the reply David  
  
I have never previously questioned the accuracy of FX charts however this thread has given me cause. Especially as you wish to trade of specific trend lines and price points.  
I just enquired to IG why their's and Metatraders charts should differ and was given the nelow unsatisfactory reply. I am following up further as it is imperative that the market makers charts exactly match what the real world currency traders are trading or else it is simply guessing based on false information  
FYI  
  
Dear Sir,  
Thank you for your email.  
Our charts run from midnight to midnight so this may be the case that there will be a slight difference to metatrader for example. Our charts are indicative in this matter hence the difference.  
  
Kind Regards,

This is my way of subscribing to this thread. Have read from beginning till I got tired. I think the strategy works but I'd like to ask one question: Do you need any particular candle formation around the third touch of you TL or just pull the trigger if it closes below/above?  
If the question has been answered before, still help out please.

Wow!  
  
You steadfast on that David, apart from the fact it looks as though only the green middle candle touched, it is again a situation where if the close is at or near its low then the opening will also be at the same price and when this happenes do you still call it touching twice ?  
From the naked eye it looks a great set up. My 4H charts don't quite match up due to IG markets stuff up. How's this...their 4H charts start one hour before the market actually opens on Mondays! The earlier t/f's are fine!!!

I think the OP stated from the beginning that the time lapse from the first touch to the second should not be less than 8hrs. The two consecutive touch cannot be that much unless candle is daily.

thanks precap  
  
That is how I understood it originally but thought sometyhing must have changes as the chart in mention is a 4H.  
Speaking of 4H charts could someone please post the 4h for Davids pairs just mentioned because how you can get a short on the AUD/USD from a trend line is nothing like what I can get on my charts. I found out IG markets run BST (British Summer Time) and not GMT over 7 months of the year which means 4H charts are different to every other provider who doesn't run on BST. Do all other providers run to GMT do you guys know?

Hi debono.  
Let me try to resolve some of the confusion. It is normal that every broker has slightly different signals/charts. We have to deal with that in these forums.  
Bigger visual differences (candle shape) can also occur easily, as brokers can have different starting hours, or other open/close prices for each candle. Normally highs/lows you want to identify at a defined time are **approximately** the same at most times - but candles might still look different.  
What I want to say is, independent from your brokers price feed, you should still be able to idnetify the highs or lows which David uses as leg "startpoints".  
  
But the problem here is something different. David creates many Trendlines based on quite inconspicuous candle appearances. For this method, david also looks **against** the dominating maintrend, i.e. smaller retraces (like the one seen on AUDUSD on H4 currently). On H4, the small tips of the candles' shadows are enough for DAvid to use it as a leg for the trendline drawing. One can more easily identify the swings of the main-trend retrace on smaller timeframes, like on my attached screenshot from M30. But David draws trendlines based on H4.  
Also, the same happens when you might think it is only the 2nd touch of the trendline. If you zoom in enough, you will see it touched as a leg2, then retraced maybe 10-20 pips, then touched the TL again (leg3). Not so clear to see on H4, though,..  
I asked David how reliable he feels them to be, compared to big retraces one would identify easily on H4, like real swings over several H4 candles.  
He answered he sees them as reliable as the kind of retraces which he e.g. showed in his 1st post #1.  
  
Hope this helps.

Hi David I read the entire thread and I have traded similar to this for 3 years and I will join in to help make this a great thread.Thanks for all your time given to help others. I don't use the script but only trade it manually and always go to smaller time frame for confirmation. It's more accurate but you will miss some trades. Anyway thanks to David and all who help here. Always patient MR D.

"Hi debono.  
Let me try to resolve some of the confusion. It is normal that every broker has slightly different signals/charts. We have to deal with that in these forums.  
Bigger visual differences (candle shape) can also occur easily, as brokers can have different starting hours, or other open/close prices for each candle. Normally highs/lows you want to identify at a defined time are **approximately** the same at most times - but candles might still look different.  
What I want to say is, independent from your brokers price feed, you should still be able to idnetify the highs or lows which David uses as leg "startpoints"."  
  
Many thanks Lowen for yout post.  
  
I have been trading FX for a couple of years and have only just discovered this re different open/close times for different brokers ergo different candles.  
I must say that this has some rather large implications in my mind as BST and GMT being one hour different has a pretty significant effect on all candles greater that 1H including daily.  
We are not trading off pretty pictures and coloured lines, we are trading off the recording of crowd behaviour and re ocurring behaviour based on what we perceive the crowd to see ie bounce off 3rd hot of established trend line. If we all see some thing different ie different highs and lows then this to me seems a falsehood as far as trading off charts.  
It is not so much as a forum issue as it is an accuracy issue for mine.  
I am told that the pro's trade off mainly 4H and daily with some use of the 1H.  
Not sure how true that is but is it is then collectively we are all only redaing the same charts at time frames from 1 hour and less. Definately puts a different perspective on things for me and thanks once again for your insightful post

Can you imagine a newbie disagreeing with the boss? I beg to disagree and hope to be pardoned. Let's see how this plays out though. It's the market for us all.

Hi, guys!  
  
Are all these AUD long trades right? Did anyone take them?  
What would we do in the case where we have two "opposed trendlines" nearby?  
  
Thanks!

Nice simple system you have here, congratulations.  
  
  
You may find the Sweetspots Gold round number indicator I modified useful, to show where the third leg may have good support, without putting lines all over the screen.  
  
  
The indicator puts Round numbers only on the right hand side of the screen.  
Change the shift lines number to make the lines longer or shorter.  
  
Hope you guys find this useful.

You mean the Round Number indicator?  
  
No one else seems to have had this problem.  
  
  
You have to download it, then drop it into the Experts/ Indicator folder of your MT4 then close it down and restart MT4 before you add it to your chart, as with all MT4 indicators.

When the market failed to hit thru my blue channel many times (you can refer to the chart I posted then), I closed with +7 and ran. I don't hold a trade after 3 attempts at a point.

I would say it is more of a method of determining high probability trades and nothing more than using s&r possible bounces or breakouts. Simple is better I like it. Always patient MR D.

Thanks, John!  
And what you did in the case where there were two opposite TLs nearby? You traded both with a smaller TP?

I am new to the system, as till today I have taken bounces on TLs after I see candlesticks patterns on them. Those trades I posted were a group I found when analyzing the charts with my other strategies.  
  
With David's system I have seen entries everywhere! There are lots of TLs in almost everypair; thus, I am not sure if all of them can be taken (but I suppose that they can).  
  
Do you take all trades you see in all pairs?

guys as usual monday theres no trades, was thinking about taking a short setup by a trend from last week but thought would give it a miss. usually by wednesday should be some trades so keep checking here and the nnclient will be auto updated.

Hi David, first of all... thank you for the 4 hr TL method. I have post a UJ 4 hr TF chart and I have drawn two lines. Red and Yellow. Are this two lines valid? Sometimes, I can drew numbers of trandline within a 4hr tf, and I am not sure am I correct. How far will u look at the 4hr tf..e.g how many candles in total? Thanks david

I think we should reconsider the paltalk trading room due to the many junks & spams coming into the room. A skype room should be better as u can block such spam and even delete any unwanted comments. In the alternative, Microsoft also has "Teamviewer" which we can also use, as screens can be shared and even taken over by another trader if granted permission by the originator. Just for your consideration guys, so we have an effective trading room.

I'm still in too, but it never looked like breaking through the daily pivot. Looks like it might be approaching for one more attempt.

hi,  
I thought the 3rd bounce has already happened before (red trendline).  
  
Why did you choose the green one, David? On other occasions you mention sth like "the trade did already happen", sometimes you don't. I just want to get into your thinking.

Great trade guys and thx Dave. I almost missed the boat as my nnhost did not update but luckily I'm alerted immediately a message is posted here. Made it out with some 20 pips after missing another 20 but good enough for me.![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Good call on that H4 Touch. Earlier there was a 3rd touch on daily... Is it that we are only focusing on h4, or when a daily is seen we can notify the group.  
  
Please advise.

I would think the first touch or should I say the L1 is too far back from the L2 but will leave that to Dave & the other gurus here, as I'm just learning too, but good observation and I like the confluence for additional confirmation. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60e.png?v=15.1)

david,  
take a look at your method on the daily, getting really close to a touch, and the momentum may be slowing down?  
just my 2 pence worth.

david, it has took a while but it finally got down to 109.15 with very little momentum so i have opened a long position on your daily rules?, lets hope its a good one and takes a ride to the top of the existing channel, keep it going and best of luck,

Hi David ,  
  
We need to know your system better . How do you consider a valid trade . Its not just L1 , L2 and L3 , right ?  
  
You can give some examples of In-valid trades as well .  
  
  
Thanks

David, I just ran into your thread....very happy to be here. I've been using a version of your method for a bit.  
  
I use the break of the previous trend line and the second bounce off the new trendline. I'm getting the same results. I started to use the Fib as a final deciding factor to enter. Also some other indicators but I probably don't need them. It just makes me feel better. Here's a picture below that's an example.  
  
I get about 20 pips on average off the 15 min chart. It seems to place me right at the beginning of the long runs especially on the yen pairs....at 5-12pm eastern. I use 15 pips as a stop loss. That is usually a little high if I use all the indicators. If I go more then 15 pip sl then I've made a real mistake or it's fooled me completely. Doesn't happen often.  
  
It was interesting that your software evaluated a trendline to the bottom of the falling price instead of the top. I usually place the trend line on the top falling and bottom climbing. There were three round tops falling.. The pointed reversals were on the bottom. It was saying to take a counter trade. And it worked!

Dammit, David; you owe me big-time. My kitchen is an international-standard health hazard that I was going to spend the afternoon cleaning. Instead, I have spent it reading this thread. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)  
  
Guys, this and the Nanningbob V5 thread are soul mates. This one shows us how to trade the trend after a bounce off the trendline. Bob's shows us how to catch the retrace after a strong move. We are making a killing over there; you are making a killing over here.  
  
Combine the two methods and the results will be fantastic. Bob's thread is <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=246113>. There is no need to read it all; read the first 10 pages or so to get the idea, then skip to the last 10.  
  
I am going to adapt two of my trade-sending ea's for use by the conservative traders here, or for those of you trading more pairs than are set up by nn.   
  
Bob's system involves identifying the setup, then adding the ea to make sure we do not miss the trigger. I shall adapt a buy and a sell ea so that the trigger is the third touch of the trendline, either immediately or at the open of the next candle etc - some time over the next couple of days.  
  
I shall code a semi-automatic trader as well, once I have made a few live trades and am sure I know what I am doing. This may turn out to be unnecessary, but coding trading robots is in my blood.  
  
I am not trying to move people over to Bob's thread; I am about to post a link to this one here. I think a combination of the two trading styles gives us a formidable trading weapon.

There is a pdf to describe their use.

Bugs in the EA's could wipe out accountkind. Put them on demo until we are sure there are no bugs.

Hi Steve  
  
I've had a couple of attempts at reading the nanningbob thread but cant make osense of it. Most probably because it has evelved over a long time. Can you point me at a good place to start (maybe one of the earlier evolutions).  
  
I also dont like robots...can the system be traded manually?

Don't trade forex live, will you? You will lose all your money. If you cannot even start with post 1 of Bob's thread and carry on from there, then you are doomed.  
  
Which bit of, "There is no need to read it all; read the first 10 pages or so to get the idea, then skip to the last 10." is causing you difficulty?"  
  
An asinine post like this in one of my threads would earn you a ban from all of them, so think twice before replying.

With respect to the thread master I will only mention the other thread this time only. If you go to page 1 of that thread and download the 3 zip files, in one of them you will find word documents, one of them is 30 pages read that first. It is a manual counter trend system and EAs are used to get better timely entrance.

Sir, your thread was bubbling but now it will start Buzzing big time. Steve is one of the best (and some say the BEST) coder in FF. He has a huge following which include some of the best minds in forex. They will soon be visiting and contributing to your thread. You have a fantastic system here and I guess the above mentioned people would assist you in fine tuning and evolution of your system. As Steve says these are exciting times. **Thank you for designing and sharing your great system with the FF community.**

Hi Ed  
  
In case David is busy today and this is bugging you big time (I was in the same boat few weeks ago), here is the answer to your post. Do not worry, nothing is wrong, I had the same problem at the beginning. The L1 and L2comes after a possible trade is identified. Normally Monday and Tuesdays nothing much happens and possible trades are identified from Tuesday onwards. For now you have to wait.

Having used the EA's today, I decided to implement the full safety feature I added to the NB ea's.  
  
When you drag the ea onto a chart, it asks for confirmation that you want it loaded. This is in case of re-starting the platform with an ea inadvertently left on a chart  
after its job is done.

Thanks Steve for your help here; very much appreciated. David has done a great job sharing his system and you have equally done a great job assisting with the EA. I have started reading Bob's thread and will take my time to understand the system. David's system is very simple and took me about a week to master, and look forward to the same for Bob's system.  
  
Thx you great guys with large hearts and God bless u really good for all your sacrifice and help.

I have added trading times to the ea's. You set your morning trading start time and evening end time to correspond with European trading hours _as they are in your own local time._ You need no offsets etc; simply think in your own local time.  
  
Here is where life gets difficult for your average coder. Most punters are unable to grasp the simple concept of, 'work out when Europe opens in YOUR OWN LOCAL TIME', and so post a host of questions about this.  
  
Guys, you can suit yourselves. Ask me one single question about this and I will instantly add you to my ignore list. Ask around, and people will confirm that I am ruthless when it comes to protecting my sanity from thickies. Once added to my 'ignore' list: I cannot see said thickies' questions; they cannot post in any of my threads - ever.  
  
Sorry to be so rude, but I have learned not to polite about this. I hope the attached help your trading.

Here is my tp trade from today. Legs 1 & 2 happened quickly, so I set the Trendline Buy ea onto the chart and let it do its thing. The arrow shows the entry; you do not need genius-level maths to work out the tp.  
  
This goes along with an eu tp sell trade from yesterday, and a uc sell that closed at a mptm-managed +10.  
  
Great start for me, using a system astral pointed me to late last week, so it is new to me.  
  
Inexperience hasn't stopped me from starting the auto-trader that astral _knew_ I would be unable to resist coding. Those of you who know my work will not be _totally_ gobsmacked to learn that I have already started work on the auto-trader. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

Maybe it calls for other custom indicators, or sometimes could be a font problem.

Try this it has also main markets time. You have to allow dll imports.

You have to put them in /experts/indicators folder. Than restart Metatrader to compile them.

Hi David.  
  
I found this via Steve's post on the Nanningbob thread. Just finished reading the posts and found the system simple enough to understand which is always a good start.  
  
I got the client and saw the suggested trade. But by the time I understood what the trade information on the client meant it was a bit late to enter but the trade worked out almost exactly as predicted on the client (GBPJPY buy) and would have resulted in 60+ pips! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)  
  
I thought it is worth mentioning that on the other thread a coder named 'Phover' developed a windows based panel that interacts directly with MT4 and his new version will even trigger trades automatically using an EA loaded into the chart. This may be an idea for the future for your client rather than using the mouse location memory. Please ignore this if it is not suitable for whatever reason.  
  
Thanks for sharing this and for the work you have put in.  
  
Z

Hey guys. David, I _love_ your method even more than I did when I read up at the weekend. I have done a few manual demo trades easily and successfully and will go live next week.  
  
I wasn't wrong when I described this and Bob's system as soul-mates.  
  
I have offered up a first draft of an auto-trader for this system at [http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...56#post3976756](http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=3976756#post3976756)  
  
This is a manual system, so I have placed the robot in its own thread to avoid cluttering up this one with discussions about automation.  
  
Have a look and see what you think.

hey buddy, yes this is a trade.  
  
as for everyone else the gy trade worked out well. i might be able to get free sms' from a gsm that adds small adds to the text. thinking about implementing this with the nnclient.. as i know some people wouldnt know if they have been executed unless they were watching their charts all the time.

i am running it on windows vista. not sure what ur doing but a system restore wouldnt remove any applications as it only affects the operating system.   
  
it deletes fine, doesnt run in administrator mode so it doesnt make and os changes. do you also mind elaborating on "it doesnt work" what doesnt work you cant see trades?

Yah, me too! I missed it by 20 pips, and didn't risk it!

Now it's working again. I know restore doesn't remove the file. I had to use restore to get windows to allow me to delete the file. That one doesn't make sense period!  
  
If it does it again I'll post the error locations.

Hi David. Got the message on the client as L1=83.97 and L2=84.03. When I tried to plot the points on the chart L2 is spot on a HL point but L1 did not correspond with a swing point at all.   
  
Am I reading this wrong?  
  
Another question. I had the audio alert enabled but I don't think it sounded the alarm. Does it sound when ever there is a new trade setup?  
  
Thanks

ill answer your questions for dave as i have asked him the same ones before. the audio alert only triggers when a trade is executed not when a new trade is loaded. as for l1 and l2 they correspond on mine.  
  
reads l1:8357 l2:84.03

Hello,  
  
I have been trading daily channels with entry on H4 pretty much same set up just using daily to confirm trend.  
  
Today I took AU short +62 half off as I trade MM a little different. Took half and move to break even just to see if I can get a runner.  
  
Great thread....

Hey Steve great stuff on the EA. I have searched everywhere and cant find an alert that works with diagonal trend lines can the EA be used as an alert instead of a EA sound/email on multiple charts?  
  
There was one posted here but it doesn't seem to work...  
  
Thanks

Try the attached indi. Double click trendlines and move where ever you want including creating diagonal trendlines. Delete which ever one you don't need. An alert will sound when line is touched.

Hey all,  
  
This thread was recommended by Steve Hopwood and I have to say that I am impressed.  
  
Going to try this on demo next week. i just want to make sure I have the nn set up correctly.  
  
Have there been any updates to it today as I have not seen anything? It does say "status connected" but just wanted to make sure.  
  
Thanks in advance

Hi David,  
  
thanks for the very simple method you have shown here... couple of questions if i may:  
  
1\. do you still have a skype chatroom? if yes could you add me please, my ID is grant18265..  
  
2\. do you have a break even move for you SL or do you go for TP or SL only  
  
many thanks   
  
Grant

I will fire up the nn as soon as markets open!

Thats not really a trendline, you've drawn horizontal resistance. Look at how fast price turned from the area, it doesn't look too strong, but you never know!  
  
this method works well on a diagonal line - comments?

Presently, the 1hr has closed above the TL, but still, the signal stays valid because price is not closed above the TL yet on the 4hr tf.  
  
So I'm still watching this for possible short.

Do you mind teaching me what a real trendline is? The fact that i'm new to FF does not imply that i'm new to Fx trading..I've seen a lot of ego fueling on FF moreso by traders who should still be in the classroom studying the rudiments of fx trading....  
  
Please lets learn to be humble and polite..you just might not know who is who on FF...its better to ask for explanation when you're not clear about anything posted rather than trying to prove you're a professor of Fx trading that knows all...  
  
Ego tripping wont get you anywhere..it only shows your ignaorance....

trades are only taken from euro start to new york finish and not 1 hour before or after news.  
also trendlines with a gradual trend arent usually taken also trends that are drawn from the previous week are not taken. only trends formed within the week hence the reason why there are only trades generated around tuesday/wednesday

Dave,   
  
My nn shows a buy signal on the USDJPY that was apparently for last week - I have looked at that chart - trade looked to be successful, but nn not saying successful. why would that be the case? When does the nn clear out old trades.  
  
Cheers Mate

Hi John  
I didn't realize that. So you are only taking trades where the 1, 2 and 3 occur within the same week ? I have been banging my head against a wall with my charts as they use BST and not GMT. Some times it doesn't make a difference but others it is significantly different. IT Finance charts are quite extensively used apparently yet they start their charts one hour before the FX markets actually opens hence their 2 hour chart is actually one hour and their 4h chart is actually 3 hours and each candle then starts one hour before GMT charts. That is why there appears some confusion between some charts put up previously in the thread. I thought I would just add this bit for those that wondered why we can have different charts for what should be the same time frame.  
I have no definative detail on what percentage of the market traders use GMT and what percentage use BST however it is simply ridiculous that all providers are not the same. Even if IT Finance charts are only used by 20% of the market it still means that 20% of the market are not seeing the same chart structure and making are therefore making different trading decisions.   
Anyway, if you are only using the current week then it is easy to work the trendlines with the 1h t/f.  
With regard to the comment that it isn't really a trendline. That comment is correct. It would be a stretch to take those points and call the price movement a trend however for the sake of this set up of Davids my question is does it matter?  
Is it the 3 hits that are important or should it be a defined trend first?  
I think overall everyone should be congratulated on their general good banter and support. It is unusual in any forum not to have ego come into play.  
One little thing I have noted since following along. David likes taking the long on a GBP/JPY bounce. I am not sure with you guys but my provider has an 8 pip spread on that pair. EUR/JPY however has only a 3 pip spread and so far when GBP moves against tHe JPY so does the EUR with similar pips gained. FWIW.

You're doing great. I have been printing from aud/jpy and eur/jpy. Thanx for drawing my attention to them.  
As for your trendlines, whether they're straight or crooked, it's knowledge that is at stake here. I have many of such TL on my charts and I love them because the print money ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)  
And my TLs are valid whether they're from last week or last month or yesterday.  
  
Holla for peace!

Oh dear!  
  
I thought we had a thread where we didn't have this type of postING. I guess not.   
Shame.  
You try to ask questions and offer help from over 10 years trading full time and you still have the 'kids' trying to throw their weight around.  
I guess Steve has the right approach to them.  
  
anyway Dave or others.  
A couple of failures with the JPY crosses influenced by news even if the crosses ocurred more than an hour away.  
I am still interested whether you trade the 'hits' with a trend or support/resistence or both.  
By the nature of the market we must have failures in any case or else the market will forever trend in one direction so I am less concerned with failures and more concerned with set up. If it is being auto bot traded then I am thinking thinking that it must simply take the trade on a third hit regradless of whether it is a tend or it hits support/resistence.  
One other little point I have noticed whilst looking for strength through confluence is that if you have your pivots showing and the trend line crosses through the pivot it is surprizing how often this point is a strong bounce point whether the 3 hit or 4th 5th etc

i have been trading this thread since dave posted. the rules are simple. not to trade 1 hr before or after news. now if the news is high impact and deviates greately from the forcast it can still stuff a good trade due to the bull or bear rally. going on these rules + a bit of trading intuition trading the 3rd bounce based on nothing but a bounce has yielded me 8 in ten trades success. nothing is 100% but 80% is good for me. hope this helps

Thanks John  
  
Are you trading long and short. I think Dave was just trading long?  
Alos are you only trading the 3rd hit ie if it comes back and hits it again a day later do you ignore it or trade it?  
I agree a bit of trading nous is always required and things are never black and white. The cause and rapid decline in price on JPY crosses indicated that traditional resistence lines may be broken.  
My point however is that if it is auto botted then hat can't be taken into consideration automatically. It still requires human intervention to decide on whether the trades would be set up in the NN as an example.  
Not a big fan of auto bot trading but then I am pretty ignorant in this area so my views count for little.  
Thanks for the reply

Hello, I am currently testing this strategy. However, I am a new at this trendline scalping technique and I need some advice from the more experienced user of this strategy on several things as follows:  
1\. I know that the thread starter usually trade GBP/JPY using this strategy (due to its high volatility), however, does this strat. works well for other pairs too?  
  
2\. If it does work for other pairs, do we need to make adjustments to the TP and SL set up?  
  
Any advice or suggestions are welcomed.

I guess you think yourself to be the longest full time trader thereis right?..''Adult'' who feels the ''kids'' are less off than he his.... Pride wont get you far...and i'm almost certain what your 10 years trading experience is like...Its not how far but how well that really matters in this business...  
  
I rest my case here...no matter what anybody says here from now on..all i'm interested is in making money and i'll keep to that and not some chiding from an overgrown adult...lol...![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)

My attention was brought to this and asked to confirm if this is a Trendline or not as the show of tantrums is getting some here confused as to who is right and if the line drawn is indeed a correct Trendline or just an Horizontal line.  
  
Well let me say categorically that i feel highly over rated to be called upon to put a stamp of authority on this issue, would have preffered my seniors in the business to do that.  
  
There are 2 charts in this referred post by Ftafx [your user id bothers me]. The first chart by own understanding of a TL shows indeed a true and correct TL going by the simple characteristics or definition of a TL [we have a complete wave cycle of ABCD and the TL drawn clearly joined the A and C points.].  
  
The 2nd chart however, is what i think is causing this show of gladiators [forgive my sense of humour if it offends you]. Going by the appearance on the chart posted, it would appear not to be a TL. But i think what Ftafx did was to show the 4hr TL on the 1hr time frame [i have a similar thing on my charts too] and then did not show on the thread, the origin of the TL as appeared on the 1hr tf.   
  
I would want to conclude that Ftafx traded this signal my own way and not exactly as Dave does, so i take the blame for the confusion here. I will get in touch with Dave and seek his permission to remove my posts so we can have a uniform way of trading here, afterall its his thread not mine.  
  
I hope i've been able to put to rest this issue and i plead there should be no more exchange of unpleasant words. Let's not get this beautiful thread stained with such please.   
  
Clean thread gives clean pips, and i love them pips.  
  
Happy pipping to you all.

Hello guys,  
  
I'm new here. I have followed you step by step so far. I tried this method the first 3 trades. However, I lost them all. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think the weakness point of this method is blind point at which the 3rd-bounce-candle break trendline instead of bouncing from the gradient.  
  
Just one thing I want to put forward to us is how to avoid this trap, how to identify this point. I'm still working on this...  
  
I made my trades as the pics below. I appreciate it very much if anyone can tell me what I did wrong.  
  
By the way, thank you for all your shares, contributions to us Dave, D liberator and other mems.

Please forgive me to answer this question myself.  
  
I think we need to turn back to smallers timeframes so that we can enter the trade more precise.  
  
Was I wrong friends?

press ctrl-y so it shows a new week. trades arent generally taken from a previous week especially for gbp/jpy. this was mentioned earlier on in the thread from what i rememebr. the gbp/jpy trade was a success last week. this week the trend is bearish and the reason why there are no trades is because of the sudden drop/ bearishness in the trend. These trades are usually taken with a more modest trend(where at least you can draw the line and have the 2 legs form)

Thank you very much **_john19r_**!  
  
I'm not sure about this too.  
  
By the way, could you help me about Dave's NN? Why I did click ok but it always showed only USDJPY like this? Of course, I have checked it for almost 3 days long.

I need to take some schooling on how to write stuff I guess, didn't mean it like that. I didn't feel like typing for hours to soften my words. It was just a comment.

Yes, me. But as you can see, the trendline has been broken already, so the setup is not valid anymore.

Unfortunately thats the problem, we cant know whether price will break the trendline or bounce. I think if we knew, then we would be all millionaires, lol.  
  
Sorry, I dont know the answer.

I think the trendline on GBP/JPY is too steep (same with USD/JPY), maybe there must be a bigger retrace.  
  
Check out EUR/JPY, I think this could be a valid trade.

You're so funny fguru.  
  
I think we should wait for the next candle to become a bounce-candle in 15m timeframe.

I took the EUR/JPY trade, because it was a bounce from the trendline **and** a pullback from the 13 EMA.  
  
If you check now USD/JPY then you will see it just pulled back from the 13 EMA.

It does not hit EMA 13 in my platform. That means you should open a trade and I dont?

Hm, different brokers have different data feed. Can you show me your chart with the 13 EMA on it?  
  
However this system doesnt use any moving averages, it is just me using the 13 EMA, as I have made better experiences with trendlines + 13 EMA. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

I would say I win 60-70% of the trades. Problem is that I normally trade during wrong times. I sleep during London session and I think this is the time when David wins most of his trades.

Hi Tipster,  
It is "Mini charts", indicator that allows you to display MTF's on one chart, avoiding switching to/from other timeframes. It is fully configurable, take some time to experiment. Wish you many green pips.

Trade was only good for 20 pips before market turned on good PMI report.  
  
Yes you should be right on the Aussie short, as I'm looking for a long at the re-test of the 100 SMA line (around 8945) - another H4 strategy I trade.

Thanks David  
Will be interesting to see if we can get a retrace tonight on the EUR as it is looking long and strong atm.  
Could you please confirm that the set up looks to only take trades within the current week ie all 3 hits must be with in the one week.  
  
thanks

I just wanna throw something out there for discussion. When I draw a trendline I try not to look for the second point to soon, give the market time to move around.   
  
Also, I try not to draw them off of consolidation areas. Price pivots are better (not pivot points), this is an area where price was rejected and turned around, which is NOT consolidation.  
  
What I do to train myself is to go back and draw trendlines where price did break out, and see how the lines connected to price. This also gives me an idea if the pait actually respects trendlines. The one thing you cant do is determine if the price moved from news or if it was just pending orders sitting around.  
  
I saw another comment in this thread saying that the trendlines was too steep (a comment on someones chart) and I have also noticed that. Problem here is when you go to lower timeframes and zoom in, the line isn't steep anymore. To solve this I draw my lines on 4 hour charts and above. Then I zoom in to snap the line to price.   
  
This is how I look at angled lines, horixzontal lines are different in that they are more bases on levels. The wmd thread talks about this (and there is a PDF in the thread you cant grab to read it without the noise).   
  
My major killer is overtrading - I look for trends on too small of timeframes to force a trade. I keep tell myself to stay away after the trade loses, but then it happens again. Maybe I'll print my guidlines and post them on my monitor. The good news is that I'm still making pips, I just have to get rid of the bad trades.  
  
Does anyone else approach trenlines like this?   
  
Suggestion: Post trades that worked, post trades that didn't work - compare, gain insight. I think everyone can learn from this (don't get me wrong, I'm no pro, I just think we can all learn from seeing closed trades)  
  
The EA I use to tade trendlines does a screen capture when the trade closes, makes it easy to look at all trades.

This guy is a trainer at Online Academy, they send out free news laetts that are good reading on supply and demand. If your sick of indicators, sign up.  
  
In my opinion, indicators are great for EA's (how else would a computer know whats going on...) but for manual trading, trendlines work, not all the time but they make me pips and thats why I'm here.  
  
I remember a few years ago spending so much time coding, I forgot to watch the screen and learn price action. My eyes opened when I zoomed into a potential horizontal line breakout and watch the 1 minute struggle to break it. You can see it let go. It looks like a guy running for a bus with his buddies holding him back, he fights them off after a while and BAM - price goes out of the range like a mini news release. Anyways, I still suck at it, making pips but also making lots of mistakes, luckily the math of risk management helps.

I gave an answer to this earlier on somewhere in the thread...you are right.  
  
Will soon be deleting some of my posts here..[still figuring out how to do that] so as to allow a uniform way of trading here...personally dont like when a trader starts a thread, some traders come on board and change the thread's style of trading...causing more confusion..so i shouldnt be doing that...this resulted in exchange of unpleasant words btw traders here [both the child and the one who shld be an adult trader...lol].  
  
Ftafx [contacted me and happens to be a former [graduated] student of mine...thats why the use of his id.....fta..[Forex Traders' Academy]... i really apologise for his unruly behaviour even though he was mis-understood, still no excuse for his unruly behaviour....  
  
I hope you guys keep on pipping....i love them pips...lol

It's okay D. It was just some moments of straying around. But all of that was because of pips. Everyone likes pip. I think nobody blames you.

I have read this entire thread and find it fascinating. The simplicity is refreshing (and I think very rewarding). I have entered several trades on demo and all have been successful. This is the latest...did anyone else enter this trade?

guys, is this a valid set up? do you wait for a bullish candle to form before entering, or do you enter AS the candle forms?   
  
secondly, do you still use 50 point sl/tp?

Interesting how it drew the trendlines. The green came from the indicator. The yellow was my trendline. They both got the same result. Looks like the indicator is a triangle hunter.

Did anyone catch all four of the GJ trades last week? It was very pretty. Basically taking the bounces off the channel (TL). Each one reached 50 pip TP. I only got in on the last one though.

This is great, however, I always try to enter WITH the trend as unexpected news is easy to break the upside of the channel. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I think you will end up taking more losses on those going against the trend.

Hi Coolshades, looking at your charts, if you put in "show period separators" on you charts, it would be easier to remember that we are only looking at the current week trendlines for trades. I know I love to look at the broader specturm too and the current week seems confining..but the current week only rule keeps us focused. My 2 pips worth.

Just took second trade ..short on this pair. First trade was long for 50 pips although could have stayed in until the top of trendline channel was touched... which would been over 100 pips. As daily and weekly trend is down, this short trade should be "easier".

Thanks DW...as I see it, trendlines, as with resistence and support levels, are not exact science..rather a range. I adjusted the diagional line, but it didn't change anything. Yes, I am channel trading, using this 3 touch system. I do not want to offend anyone and if I am "straying" from the thread, please just let me know and I will no longer post.

Thanks once again for showing us this simple but very effective method. I think we have an army of traders here who wish to be on your sms list (needless to say I am in also). Keep up the good work.

hello  
  
jus recently added using trendlines to my trading strategy (used to be loyal to my 2EMAs that is consistently giving me good profit) but there are times when the trend starts a few candles (4 H) prior to the EMA crossing so i am trying to see what TL has got to do with it  
  
quite interesting, i just started exploring it since last night  
  
new journey and wish to learn from other's experience and lessons

i believe Dave uses the major trend lines. SOme of your charts look like secondary trend lines. i use them myself from time to time but i don't think you can expect his normal win ratio with these lines. that has been my experience. also, i use price action with these secondary lines....i don't just enter on the third tap...i need to see movement in my direction

I agree, PA is my main "indicator" also. Not exactly sure what you mean by major trend lines, unless you mean overall trend direction which I look to daily and weekly PA to determine. But, with Dave's method, we are confined to looking at the current week's H4 bars, so that, to me, doesn't allow for "major trend lines", except as I said above, for overall direction.  
  
Several of my charts and trades were clearly channel bounce trading and I tried to make it clear that my way of trading channels was not clearly Dave's and that I would not post if there was an objection to it...but a couple of the pairs were in beautiful channels over the past 3 days and I could not pass them up. Only one of my posted trades (mostly channel bounce trades) has been a loser and that is probably because I did not watch it.   
  
Thanks for your response. I enjoy talking trading. I thought maybe this thread had died and that I was talking to myself.

I just happened to land here by chance and saw this chart. I don't want to disturb the dialog, but I do have a quick question for you, lawgirl.  
  
Was this particular trade based on anything other than the chart pattern, and the fact that the higher tfs were all pointing down?

Yes, and the fact that a beautiful channel had formed..trading channel bounces is one of my favorite ways to trade. I actually was more confident that this was a winning trade than any other of my recent trades...just goes to show what the market can do and how being too confident can back fire.

Yeah, I hear ya.   
  
You know, I was going to say that you may want to start considering having some fundamental bias to your trading decisions. For example, that NZD long you took probably should have been left alone due to economic factors.  
  
I know a lot of people walk around here preaching that price is everything, and that nothing else matters... unfortunately they're wrong. You seem to have a good grasp on technicals. I bet if you polished up your fundamental understanding of the market you'd be a pretty sharp trader.   
  
Not criticism, simply observation. I happen to think you're a gifted chartist, with discipline firmly in place. If you start trading the entire picture you could be a potential fund manager one of these days.  
  
Best of luck,  
MM

I'm at work so I don't have time to go through the charts but....  
  
There's been a ton of trend lines we could have traded on the 4 hr chart this week. I've been going up in tf to be sure there isn't a daily trendline that is close...if so I consider the higher time frame. I've noticed the price goes thru to the next line more times then normal. Dave can correct me if I'm wrong. It hasn't been 8 out of 10 wins this week on the 4hr charts.  
  
I'm not getting any trades on his software this week so I'm guessing there's a reason....I've seen a mess on the 4hr charts.   
  
Here's an example happening right now. The top red line is the daily. The other is the 4 hr. It's okay on this chart but I've seen it go much more then 50 this week.  
  
OTE=lawgirl21;4008407]I agree, PA is my main "indicator" also. Not exactly sure what you mean by major trend lines, unless you mean overall trend direction which I look to daily and weekly PA to determine. But, with Dave's method, we are confined to looking at the current week's H4 bars, so that, to me, doesn't allow for "major trend lines", except as I said above, for overall direction.  
  
Several of my charts and trades were clearly channel bounce trading and I tried to make it clear that my way of trading channels was not clearly Dave's and that I would not post if there was an objection to it...but a couple of the pairs were in beautiful channels over the past 3 days and I could not pass them up. Only one of my posted trades (mostly channel bounce trades) has been a loser and that is probably because I did not watch it.   
  
Thanks for your response. I enjoy talking trading. I thought maybe this thread had died and that I was talking to myself.[/quote]

Thanks for your kind words, I do love charts. And thanks for the constructive criticism. I use to try to keep up with fundamentals but eventually decided that fundamentals were crippling me ...meaning I was getting "analysis paralysis", so I rarely pay attention anymore. Can you recommend a concise source for market outlook? Thanks again...I so enjoy trading ideas.

Well, let's make this a little more interesting...  
  
For one, there is no "concise source for market outlook"... which probably explains you getting "analysis paralysis".  
  
Let's simplify...  
  
See if you can figure out which country is the current global leader in economic growth and prosperity by simply doing some good old fashioned Google searches.

This is my second trade today on this pair. First long - +26 pips. Time will tell what the short will do.

CAD/ JPY - This is worth watching. (this is a 1 hr chart) I just took it off the main trend line for 40 pips. It's been bouncing off it for a while. There's one coming down worth watching. It may be a big drop when it breaks the 38.2 fib. It didn't get it's 3rd tap yet. Look at it on the daily. A nice big triangle if you want to do the bouncy woncy.

No I went with the down trend and went off the main trend line...it wasn't beautiful taps but it's been falling of the line for a week and was a good trade for 40 pips. I was waiting for the one falling to tap the 3rd time...it did but broke thru, back up towards the main trend line....another good example of a break thru towards the master trend line.

it's 6:21pm eastern....E/J has tapped 3 times going up. Looks like a double bottom type. It's only about 10 pips off the line.  
  
Got in a little late but....pfg best showed a little different chart then IBFX. PFG showed the three taps.

Took 18 pips x 2 units on E/J....got in late so didn't go for max on my live account. I'll run my demo a bit more.

Lawgirl,  
  
It just dawned on me. Correct me if I'm wrong. You're trading the channels with 3 bumps of the main trendlines and triple bumps of the lines between the main top and bottom line. Hummm...sounds very powerful. How's your win ratio?  
  
Like this chart on 4hr???  
  
Also here's a 1 hr chart of the same thing. Holy moly...this looks powerful. Using the channel and intermediate trend lines it makes the main trades longer. Using the third tap on the intermediate line gives me the ability to stay in about 20 pips longer....after starting the trade at the third tap of the top main trendline. (on 1 hr chart)  
  
I noticed something very interesting on the 1 hr chart. The last little tail (on the third chart) had three taps on a little trendline going to the bottom main channel line. This said that the price was going to fall below the bottom main channel line....and it did. Notice it...I will pay attention to this from now on before entering...on the 1 hr chart.

Sorry for the late response, I was out for the day.  
  
I like your H4 EU chart and would have been ready to go long once PA tapped the bottom line for that third time.   
  
You are right about my channel trading. I would add, I only trade pairs that I can confirm direction on the weekly, daily, and H4 charts. I don't care what H1 is doing as long as the other three are in the same direction. I use RSI to do this. That way I always know if a potential channel trade is a trend or countertrend trade. I do a quick scan of about 12 pairs and eliminate all that direction does not confirm on the 3 TFs. This generally leaves me with about 3 pairs. Then I watch.

I've been trading the channels and triangles the same way.....Seems to work well. `Counter trend is were I usually lose money. I'm cutting counter trade out completely. I'm going thru all the pairs also....I get about the same...2-4 pairs to trade. It is amazing how the triple tap on a trend line is such a fine indicator of the coming payoff.  
  
The one thing I liked about the 1 hr chart (as a last check before entering...I always use 4hr or better for everything else) was that just before it came to the bottom channel line it triple tapped a small trendline on the 1 hr chart. It didn't show on the 4hr. It told me it was going to go thru the line and it did. I'd rather wait until it recrosses back up over the bottom channel before I enter just in case it decides to keep going. We've all seen it keep falling when all indicators said it should rise......for a long time.  
  
The direction thing makes sense. So your not taking counter trades at all? Are you winning better then 10% of your account / month?

As per using a quick peek at the 1 hour chart (looking for a 3 tap trendline) before the final 3rd tap of the 4 hr trendline.....  
  
If I can identify that the price will fall through the bottom channel then I get two advantages. If you truely believe the trade will be good.....   
  
1\. I can reduce my stop loss. I still calculate 50 pips from the original entry point but I can figure it will drop 20-50 pips. When I see bull price action on a lower tf chart then I can enter yet still keep the original stop loss. It reduces potential loss a lot.  
  
2\. Also I can get a few more pips on the trade by entering below the trendline.  
  
Last night E/U dropped about 25 pips below the trendline entry point before it reversed and went up.

Yes, I do countertrend trades... really I would call them re-trace or pullback trades..within the overall trend. I just don't expect as much from them as I might a full blown trend trade so my TPs are lower. (tell me if this doesn't make sense).   
  
I have not wanted to talk about using the H1 charts too much, as this is not what this thread was set up to study, but I believe you are correct in stating that confirmation on the H1 makes for a more powerful trade. I got my last winning trade of the week this morning shorting GJ, entering on the third tap of the H1 chart.  
  
  
  
My goal is to average $500 per day, 4 days per week. I am hitting that average. I do trade other systems though.

A good week for me trading David's method - or my understanding of it anyhow.  
  
Mostly, I trade nanningbob's V5 method. If you are fully confident with trading David's system here, then visit <http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=246113> to read about his system. It is a retrace, or 'counter-trend' system and both methods complement one another beautifully.  
  
Since 2nd August, I have painlessly increased the balance of my account by 19.17%. Roughly 20% of this profit I generated using David's trading system. This is in two weeks of live-trading it and only looking at the 4 majors + GJ charts - remarkable.  
  
What I am finding is that Bob's method generates lots of trades that hit their breakeven regularly. David's method generates trades far more likely to carry on to their +50 tp.  
  
Lovely stuff David. Thanks.

These are the two systems I am studying now as well. Using both on demo until I feel completely confident I know what I am doing. I have 2 systems I am using live right now that are doing quite well, but think these could be as good or even better.

LG,  
  
how do you exit a trade?do you absolutely wait for sl or tp to be hit without intervention? or close trades early? i am assuming your sl and tp are 50 points on all pairs.

With an open chart go to "Charts" --> "Properties" --> "Common" --> and check "Show period separaors" That's all you need.

I do not use an absolute SL or TP level unless I am going to sleep or will be away for hours, then I will use the 50 pips SL/TP. Otherwise I generally use support/resistence levels.

Are we missing good trades by not analysing what I call bridge candles and PA. Take a look at these wonderful trades the past 2 weeks on GJ alone. First for almost 500 pips, second for over 200.

I followed this thread for a few days until it got taken over.  
It looked like a viable method.  
It looks like the take over artist has moved on. I'll start looking at it again.

That's exactly what I was talking about with the stuff I mentioned. I'm looking at one right now. It's deadly!!!

The first "bridge" is not a trendline but an arbitrary upper channel line which you shorted off the bounce. The second "bridge" makes more sense since it's more of a legit trendline.

I am using the ea's I posted here to make the entries. There is also the auto-trader, but this is still experimental and going nowhere near my live account.  
  
I draw the trendline once I can identify a reasonable pair of legs (sounds kinky ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f923.png?v=15.1)). Then I set the appropriate David 4H Trendline Buy/Sell EA and leave it to do its thing. This way, I do not have to monitor the charts in order to pull the trigger.  
  
Mind, the ea's pay no attention to other factors that might affect my decision to take a trade. All they do is pull the trigger on the third touch/pierce of the appropriate trendline. Thus they may not suit everybody.  
  
They save me a shed-load of chart-watching.

Nothing arbitrary about it, as I see it. I just did not extend too far back into the week when drawing my TL, as that is not what this thread is about...but there are trend lines a plenty. Point is there was a beautiful set up for that 500 pip move down and I missed it..hope to not do that again.

I understand - what i was saying is it technically is not a trendline, but an upper channel line. In an up trend the trend line connects the bottoms not the tops. That's why i said your second example has more validity.

Examine this statement.  
  
By _whom_ would the intervention be made?  
  
_Who_ says it will be made?  
  
_Why_ should it be made?  
  
_If_ it is made, will it make any difference?  
  
Need I go on?  
  
Why should the markets care whom is the PM of Japan? Dem markets dey go up, den dey go down, den dey go up again...........................  
  
We have been having a laugh at this sort of guff in Bob's thread. Stay out of the market if you do not want to be in it, but not because some dipstick says something that has no backup factual information.

E/J - Notice the two big twin peaks.....draw a line down from the second one to the tops of the 4th peak from the end and the second from the end. A nice triple tap going down. Also, a nice cross on the 4hr thingy I sent you. Three bops and a r/g 4 hr cross....the ultimate.

Fundamentally, yes. Although there are nuances.  
  
Dave uses 50 for SL and TP. I use support/resistence levels.

I think it depends on how risky we are willing to trade.  
  
By the way friends, what should we do in some cases like below with one downtrend and then one uptrend?

Look for your bias on larger time frames. I have found that by mid-week, generally, the directional bias has been set by the weekly timeframe...so that is my measuring stick in most cases. Of course, if PA is showing something else..go with PA.

Weekly, daily..even monthly bias for GJ is short...any other direction, IMHO, would be a countertrade.

Thanks lawgirl21 !  
  
By the way, with your experience, do you think we should enter the countertrade like that? Is it a little risky, right?

I won't tell you to enter a trade, or not. Countertrend trades are riskier than trend trades, and trend trades are risky in and of themselves. So depends on your comfort level and tolerance for risk.  
  
I enter countertrend trades all the time in what I call channel trading. But they are generally well controled and within specific parameters. Most are successful, some are not...like all trading.

You started on a very weird day. It almost seemed like there was a currency war going on.....  
  
You're trade was correct. Just be careful tonight. The wolves are howling. Do the same thing, the same way next time....you'll be fine!!! The trend was down on the h4, daily, wk. Good choice for a first trade.

Hi lawgirl21,  
  
I dont think this one is a valid setup. The first and second leg are very close to each other as Mr. Dave said from the first pages of this thread.

Out with +45 pips. Could have stayed in longer for over 100 pips, but got tired of watching.

how do you manage the trades? once two touches have been done, do you keep watching the next h4 for a touch to enter?

Exactly, if I can..meaning if I can get to the computer. I have a full time job, but am self employed so that helps.   
  
I have 6 regular pairs that I watch. I try to scan them at 10, 2, and 6 a.m. and/or p.m. Obviously I miss the 2:00 a.m. scanning most of the time. Often I am late for a trade i.e. I don't get there at the third touch on a new H4 candle. I then have to decide to take the trade anyway or not. That last trade I posted, I was very late on, but took it anyway because I thought it had a lot more ride to it. It did, I was lucky. Hope this helps.

So you set certain intervals for looking out for trends? I looking at about 4 pairs, dun seem to have any trend currently.

EU, GU, EJ, UCHF, GJ and NZDUSD..but I really don't think it matters which pairs you pick. I will look at other pairs if someone points out that something is happening on them. My limit to 6 pairs is completely arbitrary..becuase I can't analyse and "control" more than that.

your period separators, your chart would be easier to analyze. The separators also help to keep focus.   
  
This was a winning trend, but, IMHO is now too late to enter. I have been watching it too, but missed it. I personally would not enter it now, although it may go up a 100 or more pips further.

10, 2 and 6:00 am/pm is my local time on my particular platform at which the H4 candles are formed i.e. a new candle starts at 10:00, a new candle starts at 2:00, a new candle starts at 6:00...ad nauseam. **Everyone should know the times of formation of new H4 candles for their time zone, on their particular platforms.**

Lovely channel. I'm looking to go short if PA continues down. This would be a counter trend trade and more risky, but if it continues down and taps the bottom line, it will be a 3rd tap for a move up again.

Did you get in to E/G lawgirl. Took a quick 16. Had 20 but it jumped like a frog backwards. It will probably drop another 20 or so....hummm...maybe not...just broke trend line. My white teeth are showing!!!   
  
83.5% win ratio so far this week....10 wins...2 losses. Funny to say but, I should have had 1 more win....made a mistake! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Way up in pips.

Went in late a little bit ago and took 10 pips off E/J. I've pretty much made my goal for today. I'm relaxing. I'll let you know if I spot something.

I am in it. Try it on demo first and move to live if there is movement. It has been slow in moving down.

thanks do we trade only when it touches or anyone trades it moving down to touch it then trade again when it touches?

It works on all pairs. You may have to adjust for some because they don't move as much. I don't take a set 50 pip TP so you'll have to make your own way with that. Use the 50 pip TP if you're not comfortable with anything else. You can use the EA's if they work with your broker.   
  
Use the 1-3% thing.   
  
This system works. Hear me....it works!!! Hear me...it works! Trust it, follow the rules and do it on a demo until you can say....it works. You can expand a bit on the trades after you are comfortable with it.

....make sure it touches. Try to catch it right when it touches or use the EA's. You can be a little more liberal on entry after the touch but you want a touch.

Actually might as well use the trendline alert and buy/sell ea combo. in that way we can learn more.

Don't know...stopped using it a week ago...  
  
The trades look good ....extend the line for a third tap. like it when the first tap is at a retrace.

Yeh, that 3rd tap happened at the 10:00pm candle, so I could have had it but was just too tired.

yes...then down to the master 3rd tap. I'm watching the 1 hr for the 3rd counter tap. Actually there's 3 on the 30 min. Should be worth a few pips. maybe 10-15

Yes there is..just my trendline drawing was a little sloppy. Remember that there are no exact numbers that we are dealing with here.

USDCAD is range bound now. I would stay away from it.

I take counters from time to time....especially in a channel or triangle. I probably shouldn't because that's were you'll lose more often....but...with three taps they usually work out. I don't want to hijack Dave's thread. If you do it...go for minumums. These are not plug and play trades. You baby sit them.  
  
Do the basic system first....you'll see the extra trades after a while.  
  
I don't take any trade without evaluating it on all time frames.

I'm newly registered here but have followed this thread a good deal and appreciate all the insight here. The GU looks to be in a possible downtrend with the 3rd tap on the current candle. This may be a counter trade. I'm curious if anyone else sees it this way as I improve my skils with this method. Also, the AUDUSD seems to be in a downtrend too. Comments?

Any thoughts on USD/ JPY?  
  
It's bumping a horizontal line. I have other indicators that say it's maxed at the high? A good drop on most pairs of JPY....on open tonight? Sooner?  
  
G/J looks similiar.

Thanks for the reply. It looks to be working out that way (up). The AUDUSD does seem to be working out as a short after a 3rd touch. I think I'm getting the hang of this. Demo for now.

I think all indicators are up on anything related to the JPY because the central bank in Japan has taken steps to devalue the currency, hence the big jump in everything XXX/JPY on 9/15. That makes me want to stay away from these pairs until we have more data in a few days and things settle out. I do believe these will drop, but it gets scary when the gov't steps in to move currencies. To me when that happens "all bets are off."

Sorry, I'm late getting to charts. I don't like that spike, though I beleive there is plenty of up room (look at the daily and weekly) left. Weekly, daily are long. Another 3 touch formed after the spike. Will be interesting to watch.

The double top says it's maxed unless it does something very unusual. It looks a lot like the makings of a double top on the 1hr. The thing is the spike up from the other day was artificial. I think it will drop, at least some, tonight. The kicker will be if it breaks the line you drew. The bottom line.  
  
I'm wondering if the long line means down???

G/U may be reversing....it's tapping a horizontal line. Watching G/J...it's tapped a horizontal line two times....I think all the JPY pairs are maxing. Some of the other pairs seem to have been caught up in the japanese manipulation this week....I'm thinking lots of pairs may try to find their true value tonight....which is down.

I hear you on the higher TF's. The lower TF's are starting to move down. the 1 hr is falling a bit....bouncing down off the horizontal line. Also, some people may be taking profit after the wild week.  
  
Look at the red line on the TDI. It's bending on the 4 hr.

I've been very careful today. All the JPY charts have major resistance..... 112.38 for e/j....it may break it.   
  
Up a few pips. Not staying in for the long haul today. My short was good on G/J but didn't stay long. I don't like what I'm seeing. It doesn't want to do anything. I think the japanese thing has effected all the pairs in one way or another.

Sometimes that's just how it is. I didn't have a chance to do much until tonight, but more than doubled by goal in the last 30 min. Will call it quits for the evening.

Our charts appear to be very different. Yes, wait for a third tap to enter. I sometimes wait longer than that to observe price action.

My first trade with this system too had a negative with nz/usd. No beginners luck! Maybe i did something wrong.  
Are the nn signals working for you all? I am not able to run the nn......After pressing the OK button no TL1 does not come.....help required to setup the nn. I did view the video 3 times though.

We probably have to have a re-read of the complete thread and hope someone would step out to give a feed back. Also we may probably have to have a look at the previous charts discussed. Does this method has a 'no trading on Friday' as with some other strategies?![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f615.png?v=15.1)![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/2753.png?v=15.1)

Thanks driftwood, noted. But I am quite upset with the margin requirements in IG. May think of changing broker. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f641.png?v=15.1)

You are forgetting a fundamental rule! Only trade the current week. It is really not important for the 3 tap system what previous weeks have done. You are making this far too complicated.

USDCAD is range bound..meaning it does not know what it wants to do. Weekly trend is down, but daily trend is up which confirms indecision. I would stay out of it unless it breaks hard to one side or the other. Remember that we do not have much time to trade today.

No problem. We are all "always learning". Put the period serpators in your charts, it really helps.

could you please tell me how do you determine weekly, daily, 4h trend direction. Could you post some example charts for us please?  
  
I'm not seeing the same trend direction as you. Do you use any indicators which tells you the trend direction for weekly, daily and 4h or just by looking at the price? Please let me know.

I use a very simple RSI (3) indicator + PA. I will try to post.  
  
Look at these EURUSD charts...weekly, daily, H4. Look at the RSI indicator. You can see that the indicator does not confirm direction on these 3 TFs. I prefer all three to confirm direction, but depending on PA may enter a trade anyway. Hope this helps.

Thanks. That really helps. I was looking at your previous posts for the past few weeks and I just noticed an indicator at the bottom (looks like RSI) of your charts but it says WOW:Long and sometimes WOW:Short. Is this a custom indicator you wrote yourself based on Rsi? Sorry to ask too many questions. I was just curious.  
  
thanks

You are very observant. I have tried not to have that indicator showing, as I it is a custom RSI indicator that I paid someone for so it belongs to him, but I have forgotten to minimise it sometimes. The RSI (3) that I posted is the same, except it does not say "long" or "short"

I'm curious where the one week rule comes from. In the very first post on this thread, David shows three trades with the system. Unless I'm misreading the charts in that post, in the first trade the third tap comes after a weekend has passed. In the third trade (second trade, second chart) it looks like there is over two weeks between L1 and the third tap.  
  
Was there some development I'm missing? Please forgive me if there is an obvious answer to this concern. I'm just trying to get a firm handle on the mechanics of this technique.

Nobody is paying attention to this thread anymore.  
  
Do what works. Look at it....if it works ...do it.  
  
Take the time to go through the charts and back test it.  
  
It works...believe me. don't get super hung up on rules. three taps...if you are afraid to try it...just do the major trend lines....big long pretty trend lines.

Drvmarch asked a question about a possible trade setup. Lawgirl answered that it did not follow the rules. Drvmarch then thanked Lawgirl for educating him on the rules of this system. That's all fine. But I was curious about the one week rule, because it seems to have creeped into this system, and I can't figure out where.  
  
It's clear that there was no such one week rule at the beginning of this thread. Two out of the three examples that David gives to explain the system violate a one week rule. But there also seems to be a clear sentiment that there should be a one week rule. Lawgirl says so. Moreover, Steve Hopwood seems to be incorporating it into his bot for this system.  
  
So, I'm wondering where it came from and what was the basis for it. If this thread is the wrong place to ask for details about David's Trendline 4H Scalping method, then please accept my apologies.

I have re-read the first 10 pages and you are so right..I can't find a reference to the week rule. I don't know if that rule was relaxed, or if I made it up! If I have confused or mislead anyone for saying this (more than once) I sincerely apologize. It is a rule I follow for entering trades, but not for garnering overall trend, however, so I may have added it subconsciously to Dave's rules. Again, I apologize to Dave and anyone I may have confused.

Re-reading the thread, I think its pretty easy to see how someone might think this was a rule. It seems to have creeped in, I think as a kind of accepted misunderstanding. And it's an interesting (at least to me) study in Internet "telephone."  
  
As you noted, it was clearly not a rule at the beginning of the thread. Comments 50, 74, 76, 77, 78, 81, 88, 133, and 139 all have set-ups that jump a weekend. There are also a number of set-ups that jump weekends that David specifically confirmed: those are on comments (31,35) (89,90) (139, 144). On top of that, in comment 247, Dave showed a setup spanning from July 7 to July 20. And the very first trade on the shared Neural Network spanned a weekend (comment 380). It's very clear that there was no such rule at the outset.  
  
Then, around comments 602-609, there was some confusion about a restart from the beginning of the week on the Neural Network. David had just added extra pairs to the NN, and he restarted the system from scratch to avoid some confusion. It looks like the restart of the automated system also occurred in subsequent weeks, but I'm not as sure about that.   
  
In post 692, David comments that, as usual, there were no good trades in the early week. He thought about taking a trade that had its set-up starting from the last week, but decided to give it a miss. In post 843, Astral notes that with the Neural Network, nothing much happens during a week until maybe Wednesday or so. These comments lead me to believe that the automated system, for convenience or technical reasons, limited its time frame to a weekly basis. This would serve to cut down the number of valid trades, including eliminating many if not most of the set-ups shown in the very early pages of this thread.  
  
At comment 890, John19 says that sticking to the current week is a rule. This is the first time anyone says that its a rule. Precap2 questioned whether this was part of the original plan at 895. But there was a minor bit of scuffling/flaming going on at that time, and no-one ever answered Precap2. The next time the "rule" got mentioned was by you, and its now easy to see how this might develop.  
  
Now here's a question for you, Lawgirl. Around comment 1028, both you and Cugir321 took a trade based on this third tap idea. The first leg of the trade looks to be on Aug 3, and the third tap was on Sept 6. This was part of a chart where you got two trades, one from the bull line, and the other from the bear. How does this trade square with your own rule?   
  
By the way, I don't have any opinion about whether the one week rule is a good thing or not. I'm just trying to understand what I've been reading and learn as much as I can from other people's experience.

lawgirl, no need to apologise. you shared with us all a method that works for you and most importantly something that is very profitable. Its up to each individual traders to decide what they want to do.   
  
I think lack of understanding and fear of losing makes a trader worry about the rules. Once they understand how this works then every trader will create their own rules. The method is trendline bounce and there are loads of chart with examples. That's what matters the most.

Wow! You have done a great job of analysing the thread posts. I looked back at that NZDUSD trade and my chart was the standard H4 chart with trading short on the 3 tap. I was trading bounces, or the triangle, or channel...whatever you want to call it. That is one of my favorite ways to trade.  
  
I believe Cugir321 was posting the daily chart to show the long term trend confirmation with the H4 chart, but he probably entered from the H4 chart.

What's your average lot size on a trade? How many trades are you willing to keep open at once? And what percentage of your account are you willing to risk on any single trade? I'm always interested to hear how other people handle money management, and almost no one on this thread has addressed how much to risk on these trades.

I am lucky enough to have a pretty large fund to start with. I take money off the board when I have accumulated $5K. I do not try to double my account...only to keep it and pull profits out of it. I tried "letting it ride" but found that it begin NOT to feel like "real" money and I got careless with it. I like to trade 2 full contracts. I don't like more than 2 open trades at a time, but will sometimes have 3..watched carefully. I have a high tolerance for risk. I won't share anything else about my money management.

UCAD is getting interesting, as it is breaking out of the range.

I'm grateful for what you have shared and won't press further. It's interesting to hear your reasons for not compounding your account. Most people seem to have the opposite reaction to the accumulation of assets. As the money grows, it becomes more and more real, and that leads to making mistakes, but out of an overabundance of caution rather than carelessness.

My crystal ball indicator is giving me caution trend down on the 15min to the 1 hr tf for U/C. It's actually speaking it.  
  
It may be leading me astray.

E/CHF  
  
Watch tonight.  
  
If it falls to the bottom line then it will probably be a nice long.

I saw that, but I'm not liking it. Too late. It was beautiful 4 candles ago. Weekly, daily, and H4 in different directions. I'm staying out for now.

Thanks for pointing this pair out. Not one I normally look at. All TFs are long. I will probably watch PA awhile longer, then go in.

I think E/Chf will do a quick drop in the next hour and then party up. We'll see...  
  
It seems a lot of pairs are consolidating.

U/CAD could be about to take a third tap....if you don't mind close taps it may be a short.  
  
It just took the third tap.....as I type. well within 1 pip....I'll wait...It's a trend line from that last big spike down. Spike on the 17th.

I like UCAD more as a breakout trade...but a pip is a pip...

I don't think she took the main line. She's what we call a progressive.   
  
i'm still kicking myself in the ass over U/CAD....everything looks so damn good on that chart. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1)

The thing that scares me about E/CHF is that main trendline sitting below the price. It's a ways off. If it decides to fall you could go 85 pips.  
  
that's the one I've been waiting for it to bop.

Do your assessments after you get a third tap.  
  
You don't want to go in until at least a third tap. I believe Lawgirl went in off another secondary trendline. I think she's probably up about 20 pips so God Bless her. She can't lose now if she says...no minus or zero!!!  
  
You need to use the main trend lines until you get a deeper understanding. It won't take long.

I see that you are looking at the triangle..good. You could be right. We need to check out the longer TF directions. Weekly is not reliable on a Sunday night so I skip it and look to the monthly, daily and H4.

Longer TFs are long....so that is the bias right now.

Am I missing something here? NZD/ USD  
  
This thing is sitting in the middle of a triangle. It's gonna be a while before it hits either line.  
  
I don't think I'd go for 50 pips if I took the trade. Maybe 35 or so....  
  
Yes it should be a short but it's gonna be a while before it hits for the third tap unless something happens like news.

BE???? what's that? Be enough?  
  
NZD/USD The bias is long for a bit....the two equal pointed tops on the daily and the lower highs seems to mean it's dropping after the tap...at least to me.

"Be enough" I love it! I wish! No, it means "break even" which means I cannot lose money on the trade..I may not make money, but I can't lose it either.  
  
Post your chart and let's look at it.

NZD/USD  
  
I think he's right....I think after the 3rd tap on the top line it's going to fall for a bit.  
  
Here's the daily....it looks like it's maxed up..see the two doji types or points at the dotted yellow line....it may go thru the triangle when it drops down.  
  
There's a nice channel going down if your draw a bottom channel line. I'd bet it's going through the triangle bottom.

We'll have to watch and see..but I'm not seeing a short trade here.

actually it was 35 pips profit. I'm out. Don't lose all your profit. Calculate 50 pips from the line and subtract where you got in. Get out with some profit so you can start the week with a smile. It went a total of 42 from the line. Good enough. Start with a win! You need to feel like a winner! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
Now look at everything I told you about on the 4hr and 1 hr chart and remember what a great long winner looks like. Flip it over in your mind to see what a great short looks like. Notice where everything is positioned.  
  
Save the chart ....mark it up with verticle lines!!!!

lawgirl/cugir321,  
  
I saw the charts both of you have posted on EUR/CHF, USD/CAD and NZD/USD. It was all brilliant. I like to participate but I was in bed (i'm from UK). Its amazing the asian sessions are giving so much steady movement unlike London session.  
  
My EUR/CHF trades attached. I entered one before I went to bed and added another position when I woke up an hour ago. Red arrow pointing entry.   
  
Keep up the good work and I will participate where I can. I'm going back to bed again.

I can't figure out your trades from the chart. We pretty much use three taps and a few other indicators which we don't talk about much to preserve the thread. And the trend on the 4hr, daily, weekly...I add the 1hr for quickies.  
  
I'll say it....I add...the RSI(3) (thanks to lawgirl). Be sure it's pointed in the direction of the trade. The TDI. ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) Cross of green over red. That's it!!! (maybe a little 5,3,3 stoch like pepper)  
  
If they're all pointed in the right direction...call the bank!!! You'll be depositing. You'll have to get a feel to decide how much! The indicators, I believe, help with the secondary lines. They tell you when to get rollin'...especially out. Watch price action...make sure it confirms the other stuff.  
  
The three taps on the trend line with the trend are the key. The rest just verify's it for me. I just set 50 pip stop loss and decide take profit on my own.  
  
This three tap thing is soooo powerful!!!

I have had the same experience as Lawgirl21 using the Nanningbob system. As soon as my account is doubled, I get careless and lose my profits down to the original funded amount again. The second time this happened I have changed my strategy to keep the original funded amount and then once a week/fortnight I withdraw the profits. I us 3x $1K accounts with different brokers. I seem to have a much better Bank balance growth this way.

Sorry about the [oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") charts. They are not that good. I pretty much trade trend trading, reversal, breakouts and range trading. Trendline bounce is one of the many methods I trade and the one that is most reliable in my opinion. So I trade pretty much like you and lawgirl but my MM differ from you two (i think).  
  
Lets say for example: A trader trades 1 standard lot ($10 a pip) with a 50 pip S/L and 50 pip TP. That's $500 risk for $500 profit.   
  
I trade differently. I break my standard lots into 2 or 4 lots (i.e. $2.50 a pip or $5.00 a pip) and always look for 1:2 Risk Reward ratio. So when I enter a trade I start with $2.50 a pip with 50 pip S/L and watch what is happening. If price goes against me I lose $125 instead of $500. So I still have $375 risk left to trade for the day. If trade goes my way I move to BE and enter another $2.50 in a suitable location and another and another.  
  
So if one standard lot trader makes 50 pips in one trade. I make 80-100 pips in the same trade because I'm adding position on each retrace. The end result is I make same as 1 standard lot trader or even better. But when a trade goes against me I get 3 extra chances to trade compared to 1 standard lot trader. So even if I lose 3 trades of $2.50 each I can still end up in profit with one $2.50 trade. Because the moment I move my stop to BE I have that amount to risk to add a position or trade it again. This is absolutely essential for survival in forex. Also trading this way helps me to extract maximum out of a move which is essential.  
  
In forex nothing is certain. Even if you wait patiently and do very detailed analysis and trade high probability setup...still it is not certain. Why lose your risk in one trade?

On which time frame do you wait for the cross of green over red line? Are you using TF 1 hr other TF for this confirmation?

I like the 1 hr (and less sometimes 15min) for entry but I monitor the 4 hr. They have to show pretty much the same thing except the 4hr will be a bit behind.  
  
I don't want to hijack the thread but I've found the system becomes almost bullet proof with these things.

lawgirl21,  
  
Not in the AJ but did take the NZDUSD in both directions based on the recent posts and worked out well. Can I ask why you are in at this point since your buy is not at a touch point from the lines drawn (maybe you have other steeper lines)? Or maybe you took it when the RSI turned favorable. It looks to be working out well.  
  
I continue to learn from the successful folks here. Thanks.

I took that trade last night as a channel trade, but it did have 3 taps when I took it. I am out of it now with +38 pips.  
  
I also took the NZDUSD trade long last night because of the triangle. Out of it now with +20 pips.  
  
Both of those trades were "3 touch/tap" trades, but within a certain formation: channel for one, triangle for the other. Channel is one of my favorite ways to trade...bounce to one line, then the other..up and down or down and up..sometimes for days.

This is the other trade I took last night and am now out with +32 pips. Wish I had stayed in longer. This was a range bound trade that could not break through the resistence area (blue line). We have been talking about this pair and setup since last Friday.

Took a little off nzd/usd this morning. My problem is I have to use a cell phone at work....it's hard to go thru the pairs and draw the lines. Anything close to a third tap that you folks can see? Thanks in advance!  
  
We should start a thread....call it "Almost 3rd tap". Post just the ones within like 30 pips of hitting a third time.

Do you actually count pips away from the lines? I don't.  
  
Look at USDCHF for potential long trade. Triangle formed. PA hit TL at least 3 times. COUNTERTREND trade though, so extra care should be given.

I do when I'm waiting for the third tap and I'm trying to share the info with you guys...a heads up coming.....that post was about sharing the info online.  
  
I've been watching US/CAd...doesn't want to hit the bottom line of the triangle.   
  
U/cad looks like u/chf.......nothing is bending up enough for me to enter.  
  
thanks for the heads up.

Took USD/SGD at 1.3338...things are bending down a bit on the lower TF's. Plus the overall trend is down on the 4, d, w...  
  
The triangle bottom is about 20 pips down...I'll take about 10 pips if it is so kind to give them.

This strategy is about as clearly presented, and as simple, as they come. A good start would be to start reading at Page one, post one and then continue. Then, if you have specific suggestion, you should find people here more than helpful.

David, thanks for getting the NN up. I tried it recently for the first time and it wasn't connecting. Seems to work well now. I appreciate all you've done with this strategy. Thanks for sharing your wisdom and all your hard work.

No need to apologize sir. Welcome back you were missed. Whilst you were away cugir and lawgirl were keeping us entertained. They have now posting at 3 tap thread which is quite interesting also (a variation of your method). Looking forward to your posts

I think it is supposed to be 133.37, not 132.37 right??

Hi David,  
  
The 3rd touch is few pips away from TL on my chart. This should taken into considration as valid entry? Please advise.  
The current sell entry of GY is based on other system which is under testing for the moment.  
Thank you.

guys the 3rd touch was a few pips away from my broker aswell but because i was using the nn it auto executed. i got in at 70 and also made 50+ pips.  
  
my understanding of dave's nn is it runs of a different price feed to that of main brokers like alpari fxdd etc.. dave has explained to me that he uses fxdd charts as they closely replicate his feed's prices. so if you have autoexecute setup properly and the price hits on his feed and executes it will also execute on the nn.  
  
i have been reading up and noticed that some people think that it analyzes their charts locally. this isnt the case. its client/server based technology. so the client connects to his nn server and displays trades. when the trades are executed on the server everyone who is connected also gets executed(if you have autoexecute checked)  
  
It will be great when the sms feature is added, i have been nagging him via skype to get it up and running but he has been busy the past few weeks. well it is all free so no one can complain, i sure am not. im up over 2kpips using his method + nnclient. the method is transparent and the nnclient is for autoexecution so thanks again dave!

Just to clarify i am unable to setup the auto-execute trade unless theres a real trade that comes in.. but on my chart the price did not hit the 3rd tap i am therefore unable to set it up...

no. i dont think your getting the concept of client server setup. no matter what your price is dave's nnserver has pricefeeds i think from bloomberg/reuters and other banks. so if the price hits on his server who ever is connected regardless of what your chart says(the difference between your feed and his) it will execute.

I like this method...i will have to study it further. Personally, i think i may have to use the length of the signal candle as my entry(candle close) and SL; then, project the candle length further, use the 50% of that candle length projection as my BE point.  
  
Also, perhaps, one can add some confluence to it: round number, s/r levels, fib levels(38 to 61).

Hi guys!  
I am a bit lost regarding the last GBPJPY trade that david and other members took two days ago.   
In the chart I am attaching, I tried to find that trade (I marked the 133.36, the price at which david mentioned he went in the trade). I also put two other questions in the graph.  
  
Thanks!

Hi, I have downloaded the ForexDave nn and under trade type there is nothing. Is that how it should be?  
  
Edit: Ignore my question I just clicked ok and see a successful trade.

I don't think there is a pure perfect strategy for taking these trades. Some do better than others. When you trade the amplified pairs (anything ending with JPY), then the chances you get your 50 pips is more likely for a quick-in/out.  
  
It just takes practice and an eye for price action showing trends. I prefer EURJPY and GBPJPY personally, but EURUSD and AUD has some great smooth trends for a lot of pips.  
  
The first trade you show is a possibility, but it is a long ways out and the general trend for the last bit had changed. So.....   
  
The 2nd trade looks right pretty much. The 3rd trade is a possibility, but you are kind of working against the trend, but it is in the shape of a bull flag (large one, too big in my opinion) or a wedge, which both are bullish. 

We are our own best indicator.

Thanks for your observations! They remind me that in this strategy, as well as with most of the discretionary trading, we can not take all the trades "literally by the rules"; instead, we should look first the setups that fit our rules and, after that, use our common sense (adquired with experience) to know if the trade makes sense or not with what is happening with the chart.

sorry david, iam new.  
  
is your method still working and profitable ? where can i get the latest updates on it from ?  
  
  
also, is your method not the same thing as the 3 touch trendline bounce theory ? i.e. if it touches the trend line 3 times then that confirms the trend ?  
  
on the first page your first post , you attached 2 screen shots. the first one is a buy, you bought after the price touched the trend line 3 times and bounced. however, was it not too late to enter a buy trade then as the up trend was too far and on its way to loosing steam ? and indeed shortly after it came down sharply.

is it a buy or a sell on the gbp / jpy ?  
  
  
as far as i can see, on the downside there has been 2 touches - so not a short yet.  
  
on the upside there are 3 touches, so we go for a buy right ?

hi  
  
iam not using nn. just manual trading from charts. i cant see the figures you quoted , on my charts at all.  
  
if you can post a screen shot of the charts that would be good.  
  
i dont think it is a buy though, as both my MA'S i use are showing sell.

i wish david486 would answer some of these questions considering he is the man in the know. he never answers any questions directed at him, which i find a bit annoying to say the least. what is the point of starting a thread if you dont wanna communicate with people and help people understand your system ?? you may as well close down the thread and trade on your own.

to whatfx and all the others asking the same old questions over and over again. let me explain the gbp/jpy trade listed in the nnclient.  
  
the gbp/jpy first leg starts at 131.90 and the second 132.14  
if the price hits on any candle after these legs on the trend drawn from 131.90 to 132.14 then you buy. take into account news announcements etc(you do not enter 1 hour or before a economic announcement)  
  
it cant get any simpler than this. i have been with this thread since it has started and dave has kindly written the nnclient especially for forex factory. So please keep your demands to your self, i personally dont want him to pack up shop.  
  
and to describe the nnclient its a application which displays the trades hes currently waiting for. you also have an option to autoexecute on your broker if you wish to follow his exact trades. try watching the video.

hello whatfx, is easy, here is chart for u. Look nn and L1 is 1st point of line, L2 is next, wait 3rd to enter.

Do same for au and u will see.

you do !? ok. but the 3rd tap could take hours if not days to occur, right ? also, how do you determine how far to look back to determine the trend and number of touches ?

This is not my "home" on ff but i like to follow up on this thread anyhow, as this type of trading is right up my alley. But have you even read through the thread? I think not cause then you would have no need to ask that question. The least you can do as a sign of respect to the thread starter is to go through and actually read through it, and grasp what its all about. Should really be self explanatory.  
  
Either way have a good one ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yes I understand it works on mouse clicks but how it command 2 different clicks for the pair? There's no way to keep the order window open for 2 pairs...

Hi. I believe MT4 only allows one order window at time. I am using two brokers MT4 and they're both the same.

Howdy! I've done/looked at trades very close to using this. I'm always amazed at how perfect the touches are to my lines at times when you'd think as a laymen that it should be a range and not a touch.  
  
However, most of the time I do all of these charts, but I'm not at the computer for that precise moment to take the trade. Do you all have software or brokers where you perform a buy/sell automatically, or are these trades all manual? My issue always seemed to be an issue of being around. Unless the line is a straight horizontal support/resistance.

You may use the NN by David or the EA's by Steve.  
I do appreciate the patience of David particularly when he is expected to answer the basic questions again and again, particularly the ones which are there on the 1st post of the thread!

Hey all,  
  
I've been reading the thread and found it very fresh, especially for a method that is based on diagonal TL only.   
  
Also, good on capitalizing on relatively small take profits. That way you don't need the market to fully reverse, sometimes a temporary reaction to a level will take you to your TP.  
  
Congrats on the system!

a couple of ppl have asked me why the thread has been quiet this week. to tell you the truth the volatility has kept me out of the market. i traded of parity on the aud/usd for 100 pips(entered last week exited this week) great trade. will be looking at shorting the aud again off parity. this of course has nothing to do with my method only something i consider to be a good resistance for the au.  
as for the usual trends hopefully next week will show something good

Hi David,  
happy to hear you again and congrat for the aud/usd trade ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1).  
  
Maybe I missed something but I'm no more able to connect using your NN client. I thought you were updating it to allow the SMS function, could you please tell me how is going this project?  
  
Thanks a lot.

Sure, I got 240 pips out of the last one. One more bounce is possible...

guys just to let you know my aud/usd parity trade is closed for a total of 24 pips. i shorted roughly 3mil hence the small pip count. i may look at re-entering. my entry was 1 flat and exit was 76.  
  
as for my server and the reason why it has been down, someone compromised it. it was hacked into and some of my code was stolen. that being said the code is useless without the other modules. that being said it has demotivated me in regards to this thread but i will still make posts whether or not i put the server back up is another thing. hope all is well and all are making money ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

Sorry to hear about that man! Someone hacking in to the server is really screwed up.

David, what you have contributed is tremendous and hacking your server is a malicious act... We hope you can get your server organize so you can continue to trade how u use to. As for the thread I respect whatever decision you have taken... All the best!!

Well, I don`t count any statistics. You probably know that the method is only let`s say 30 persent of the sucses. But I realy don`t do anything special. Just some discretion. The steeper the trendline the more likely it will get broken instead of a bounce from it. Also if price haven`t made new highs or lows and coming back to test the trendline I will be more suspicious that it holds. I use sl of 100 atr on 4H TF(60 period). But if the candle break the trendline and the sl is not hit yet I more likely will close the trade. I almost alwais move sl to be when price in my favor the amount I risk, but the more I don`t like the price action the faster I do it. And for sure I like to let the profits run if the trade is in the long term direction. Yes I get stoped out more times then I cash in the big profits, but it pays off. Sinserly I trade this only for a few months, but it doesnt mean that it is too early to say it works, because there are many methods that works if combined with good money management, right mind set, patience, not overtrading and similar things. Btw if I do not trade the bounce I may trade the break. And here it is clear,-the more steeper the trendline the more likely it will get broken. I use closed candles for breaks.

I would not engage in scalping on the yen. This is the most speculative currency. According to the scheme provided by you, the best deal on the European pairs, and only if they do not demonstrate complete dependence on changes in the euro dollar. And I just pips on the euro dollar (U.S.)

Hi Chris, So do you have good luck with the 3 _consecutive_ tap approach? And if so, do have guidelines? Seems like the most successful models of Dave's approach have a true ABCD config, and on a _not too steep TL_ , as Siber discovered. I got creamed papering '3 in a row' on multiple TF's.   
  
Thanks

Hi,   
  
i want to ask, do we need to wait until price really touch trendline?  
  
how to face this condition on GU H4? price almost reach trendline but not yet (small arrow).  
  
<http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/308/guh1.gif>  
  
maybe we should place BUY LIMIT on trendline? or maybe we can BUY now?

ADR of 100pips = 1.4060 for eur/usd. I LIKE 90% of daily adr for TP = 1.4070.   
  
which makes +80 pips for me. entry was at 1.4150, sl = -19pips.= 1.4169.  
  
1st pt = +37pips at 1.4112. 2nd pt = +80 pips. CHART ATTACHED:

Why does a thread like this end and much lesser threads continue?  
  
I have been trading very similarly to this for a quite a while now for 4-5 months and have found it very profitable. Never has a system offered me such great risk reward potential. I trade the 1 hour and look to catch the third tap of the trendline but with a tighter stop. If a trendline is going to be respected then there's no need for a large stop. 15 pips or so is fine.  
  
Anyone looking to trade like this, i've learned to only trade the outer trendline. It might mean you miss some trades but it definitely keeps you out of bad trades more often than not.

I trade 13 pairs, basically any pair I consider to move normally with a low enough spread to trade them on the 1 hour chart.  
  
Attached are just 3 pairs for today.  
  
1st chart gbpusd (trendline drawn from 4 hour chart hence why it doesn't match the 1 hr low exactly)  
2nd chart nzdusd  
3rd chart usdcad  
  
With a tight 10-15 pip stop 4:1 would have been so easy to achieve. I've switched from looking for a system with high win rate, to looking for a system with high risk reward. I'm hoping i've managed to find both.

Thanks Gareth, I will start drawing TLs over the weekend and give it a try next week on the 1 hour charts. Do you ever place pending orders or do you check the charts every hour? Also, do you wait for the third touch candle to close after the bounce before you enter as confirmation? Thanks again and have a good weekend.

It might mean you miss some...

What do you mean by the 'outer' trendline?  
  
I have been experimenting with this method as well, with moderate success. I did about 30 trades, and maybe I just had a bad batch, but I there were not many trades that even went to test the last swing high, and I was only buying the 3rd touch of the trendline.   
  
I'm buying with a limit order right on the trendline on the 3rd touch, and using a tight stop; but I'm trying to figure out some other filter to keep me out of my bad trades. I'm wondering if maybe I should only be buying if we are near to one of my MA for example (I usually use 20 and 60 SMAs.).  
  
If anyone else has any ideas on some way to filter out additional bad trades I would like to hear it, and also what seem to be the best targets? Like I said, I was not having much luck with price even making it up to the last swing high (for longs), so targeting that wasn't working and I was not getting many trades at 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 Reward/Risk. But maybe I was just on an unlucky streak.

It's entered off the minor round number, it's also at the 0.618 retracement of the move down (I only bother with 0.618 retracements). It's been hit a few times so lets see, I'm at breakeven so I don't particularly mind.  
  
Sometimes I look at lower timeframes for confirmation if i'm at my computer and there was a good 5 minute pin bar rejecting it (or at least the minor level..)  
  
In hindsight the trendline would have been better connecting the previous major high but in hindsight everything looks better and you can match everything perfectly, this is what I saw so this is what I traded when the chart was blank to the right...

Its not easy to sell when the chart has been going up with no confirmation, but i'ts the only way i've found to have a method with a decent chance of hitting 3:1.

Another trade as per my rules, it might not work but I don't expect them all to. That's my winners are generally 3:1.  
  
Off the 140.000 level so gives some confluence to the trade.  
  
Will stop trading for the day after this one..  
  
Just to add that I trade the 1 hour charts..

Decided to close it at 2:1, so adding the usdcad and 2 audusd trades (one worked and one didnt) means I had another good day.

High win rate? Would that be the old Jankone thread on 5 and 15 minutes ? It still works well for a patient trader albeit maybe less pips per trade. than your 4hour/One hourly approach.

The 5min Ryanmcd method is still my go to method, I just find it interesting searching for alternative ways of trading. The 1 hour method doesn't really take up too much time and I like the high r:r aspect. I wish Ryan would come back and post. He was one of not many I trusted on here and I have no doubt that he's still trading the eurusd exactly as he taught here, seeing if it's making higher highs etc and trust trading dips in the trend...  
  
Out of interest, how do you trade turnip? I often come across you on threads similar to what I like as well...  
  
EDIT: I just looked at your profile and saw how you trade, no worries in explaining it here...
