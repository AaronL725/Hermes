I assume everybody knows how to enter and exit the market but don't know a few rules that related to Money management.  
  
Such as;  
  
i - where to enter & exit with Money management,  
ii- where to display stop loss with Money management,  
iii- how to diversify the account with Money management (Scale),  
iv- how much we can risk our account.  
  
The website for Pivot Point;  
[http://www.actionforex.com/forex_ana..._200603215756/](http://www.actionforex.com/forex_analysis_and_forecasts/pivot_points/gbpusd_200603215756/)  
  
  
1) Where to enter & Exit;  
  
Everybody has own way of enter in to the market. No body can say the way you enter the trade is wrong. But, it's depend on how long you want to hold the market if the time that you enter the trade is non active market.  
  
The best time to enter the trades are during London Session and New York session.  
  
Once we know when is the best time to trade, we should know what is the trend for the day. The easy way to find the direction of the trend for the days is using the Pivot Point (PP). If the opening price is above the PP means Bullish. If the opening price is below the PP means Bearish.  
  
Now we have to find out what price to enter. Using the PP level at Daily, 4 hours, hourly will help us to place an entry.  
  
Entry Strategy;  
  
If the price above the PP level Daily, 4 hrs, hourly, we can enter at R1 hourly PP.  
  
If the price below the PP level Daily, 4 hrs, hourly, we can enter at S1 hourly PP.  
................................................  
The most difficult part is where to exit. We always say, we want to let the profit run until maximum level. How do we know the maximum level?. The PP will came-in as a leading indicator. This is one of the way we can discipline ourself.  
  
Exit Strategy;  
  
For buy - use 4 hours PP level (R1,R2,R3) for exit level,  
For sell - use 4 hours PP level (S1,S2,S3) for exit level.  
  
2). Where to display stop loss;  
  
Before we can start trading our money into the market, We should ask ourself. How much we willing to lost. We can use PP to display the Stop Loss (SL).  
  
There are 2 way we can place the SL;  
  
a). If the entry using 4 hrs than the SL also at 4 hrs PP,  
b). If the entry using hourly than the SL also at hourly PP.  
  
When the price reach at R2/S2 level, the SL will move to R1/S1 and so on..  
  
3). How to diversify the account (Scale);  
  
This is the most important part of Money Management. I like to name it as a scale strategy. Scale strategy can be use in any range of market. I realise that this method help a lot on to diversity our account with affective and efficient.  
  
For Mini Account;  
1 lot = 10 units  
or  
1 lot = 100 units  
  
For Normal Account;  
1 lot = 1000 units;  
or  
1 lot = 10,000 units  
  
The strategy;  
For Bullish, look for the range from R1 to R3, or  
For Bearish, look for the range from S1 to S3  
  
Example 1:  
  
Let's say the range between R1 to R3 or S1 to S3 (4 hrs pivot) is 40.  
  
So we can do scalling to 2 target;  
1st target at 20 pips, the 2nd target at 20 pips.  
  
We plan for this range with 1 lot for every 20 pips;  
It's mean, We can buy 2 lots.  
1st lot close 20 pips at target 1,  
2nd lot close 20 pips at target 2  
  
Take your profit every 20 pips move. Every 20 pips take 1 lot. Once the 1st profit taken, move the SL at break even (b/e) or +3.  
  
For the range 50 or 60;  
Scale = 20/20/10 or 20/20/20 (3 lots)  
(SL move to b/e after 1st lot taken, after the 2nd lots taken, move the SL at target 1.)  
  
For the range 70 or 80;  
Scale = 20/20/20/10 or 20/20/20/20 (4 lots)  
(SL move to b/e after 1st lot taken, after the 2nd lots taken, move the SL at target 1 price, than when the 3rd lots taken move the SL at target 2)  
  
For the range 90 or 100;  
Scale =20/20/20/20/10 or 20/20/20/20/20 (5 lots)  
(SL move to b/e after 1st lot taken, after the 2nd lots taken, move the SL at target 1 price, than when the 3rd lots taken move the SL at target 2, after the 4th lots take move the SL at target 3)  
  
4). How much we can risk our account;  
  
We should know the size of our account that available for us to trade.  
The Ratio that suitable for each trader also different.   
For those still in mini account, try to use ratio 1:1 or 5:1  
For those experience trader can use 10:1 or 50:1  
  
Use this calculator, to find out how much the size of account that we can expose.  
  
[http://www.oanda.com/products/fxmath...vailable.shtml](http://www.oanda.com/products/fxmath/units_available.shtml)  
  
5). Technical Indicator;  
  
Try to use 2 to 3 Technical Indicator only.   
Stochastic 14,3,3 + EMA14 (plot EMA 14 inside the Stochastic 14,3,3)  
This indicator use to looking for retracement.  
  
How to use the Stochastic?  
Use this Stochastic to see the retracement level.  
Look for new cross.  
  
For bullish;  
Try to take new cross from below 50 level to upward.  
If the cross happen at above 50 to upward, the bullish continue but not that big move. This can be use as a signal for overbought.  
  
For bearish;  
Try to take new cross from above 50 level to downward.  
If the cross happen at below 50 level to downward, the bearish continue but not that big move. This can be as a signal for oversold.  
  
How stochastic work with EMA14?  
When the stochastic cross with EMA14, this can be a 2nd confirmation for entry and exit.  
  
At chart 15 minutes.  
  
The looks will be like this;

Dear howard,  
  
Not need to plotting anything... just follow the reading that given from Action Forex website.  
  
What you need to do is follow up every hour if any changes on 4 hrs pivot points level range (PP, R1,R2,R4). Sometimes, 2 or 3 hours no changes. So just follow-up.  
  
Good Luck!

I would like to inform about the Stop Loss (SL).  
Place the SL 2-3 pips below the Pivot level (Bullish)  
Place the SL 2-3 pips above the Pivot level (Bearish)

hey Olaha, very interesting system. It uses price action, is very clear, and it uses pivot points, which in my opinion are very powerful if used accordingly. Will test the system in the coming days and will return to let you know my experience. Thanx. 

We leave no soldier behind.

Dear gagiul,  
  
This is powerful system because this system is leading indicator.  
With the condition, follow the rule. In our daily life, we have to follow the rule. If we try to avoid rule, our life will mess-up. Same thing in trading forex. In trading also has the rule that we should follow. To be a success trader is not easy. We should be a discipline person. If we can be a discipline person in our daily life, in forex will be no problem.  
  
So, Good Luck to you to try this system.

Yes only Stoch 14,3,3 + EMA14.  
You can mix with any indicator that suite you.   
But try not to use more than 3 technical indicators.  
If too much indicator, you will get confuse.  
Try to use system that simple as much you can.  
  
How to use the Stochastic?  
Use this Stochastic to see the retracement level.   
Look for new cross.   
  
For bullish;  
Try to take new cross from below 50 level to upward.  
If the cross happen at above 50 to upward, the bullish continue but not that big move. This can be use as a signal for overbought.  
  
For bearish;  
Try to take new cross from above 50 level to downward.  
If the cross happen at below 50 level to downward, the bearish continue but not that big move. This can be as a signal for oversold.  
  
How stochastic work with EMA14?  
When the stochastic cross with EMA14, this can be a 2nd confirmation for entry and exit.  
  
I hope this will help you and others to be a smarter trader.  
  
Good Luck! ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

From the P level on PP, the price above all the 3 time frame of P level.  
This is the sign of strong bullish. But we have to wait for opening time on London Session.

Now price testing the R1 - 2.0375 level.  
We hold at this price.  
Wait until the London session open.  
The price will retrace by now and came back again when the   
London session open.  
  
Good Luck!

I think.. most of you can see the movement of the price.  
Now the price just want to retrace.   
Look at the stochastic that I explain earlier, wait for a new cross upward from below stochastic 50 level.  
  
Just stand by...this will happen soon.  
  
Be aware that we have a news release soon.   
Try out of trade 15 minutes before the news release.  
  
Good Luck!

I use/am still learning a system that is quite similar to what you are doing. It is based on PP support & resistance. I use some different indicators. I'm still learning it myself so i don't really want to say much, until I get better, but I will say with a trending pair, I have found this to be a powerful method. I have been using it on the AUD/USD the last 2 weeks. 75 Pips last week. 117 this week. The hardest part for me has been the discipline to stay with my plan, although I am starting to feel like I am winning that battle. please keep us informed & if I feel comfortable adding to your thoughts I will.

Seem you doing great.. 117 pips.   
  
I give some tips for you, how to be discipline;  
1). Wake-up in the morning, same time every day,  
2). Sleep also at the same time every day,  
3). Eat also at the same time every day,  
4). Take a bath also the same time every day.  
5). Exercise at the same time every day (15 minutes).  
  
Practice those for 1 week. If you can do those, you will manage to follow your own rule of trading.   
  
As I mention earlier, if you can discipline yourself in routine/daily life... we can discipline ourself in trading also.  
  
Good Luck!

What is your SL?  
Why you buy 5 lots?  
The range for now is 24 pips, my advise... with this range, we can buy 1 lot only.

Use 4 hours PP. Calculate the range from R1 to R3. Than you will know how much lots you should buy/sell.

Pepejeans,  
  
Your SL is very close. Try to use at lease 20 pips SL.   
If you use SL 10 pips, that easy to sweep away.

I manage to take 25 pips. I place my order at R2 2.0385.  
I take profit at 2.0410. I know during the news release we can take around 50 pips.   
  
From now on, the price start retracing.   
So I think.. you all can close..rest..drink tea/coffee..   
Came back again during NY Session.  
  
  
Good Luck!

That is ok...  
  
Anywhere learn from mistake.  
No mistake..you will not learn anything...  
From mistake.....you will remember.....and do not do it again.  
  
You see the price, still move towards Daily R2?  
The max for this session will be at R2 on Daily PP.  
I hope this price will hold until Ny Session, than we will take again for bearish trend.

I don't understand... R2(2.482) is not daily.  
That is 4 hrs PP.  
This is not the top yet... bullish trend still continue if the price doesn't break the 4 hrs P level to downward.  
  
If possible, look for cross Stochastic at below 50 level, to get end of retracement.  
  
Just be passion... wait for NY session because from now onn..anything can happen.

I trade only GBP/USD. You can use other currency pairs.  
If you like to trade without news effect, try to trade with GBP/JPY.  
It does effect but not so much.  
Try to trade with GBP/USD at this moment, so easy for you to follow up with me. Once you know to trade yourself...than you can take any currency/pairs.

You work with ACM broker in management or you use ACM broker to trade?  
I can't say which is good. For my opinion, the smaller spread is better and the broker can give a good execution.  
  
Check out this site;  
[http://fxtrade.oanda.com/spreads/com..._spreads.shtml](http://fxtrade.oanda.com/spreads/comparing_broker_spreads.shtml)  
  
The news doesn't give much impact, so now we have to see if the price can break the 2.0480 level. If can't break, than we look for bearish bias.   
  
I will look for break 2.0440 for sell.

I trade news after 5 minutes on release time. The spread is big (15-20 spread). So, I wait until the spread back to normal (2.5).   
  
If I am very sure on the direction for the day, I will place an order.  
  
Off course is good time to trade news...but if the price goes to wrong direction, you will loss the account. Sometimes.. I take the risk.  
  
For those new trader, try avoid news release.

Hi Olaha, haven't traded with Oanda for a while - how much did the spread widen around the news earlier?...from memory they used CPI and PPI to widen to 15-20 pips.  
  
edit: ...just noticed your earlier post.

Yes...the spread around 15-20.  
During the news release, they make the spread wide,  
after a while the price reverse again. I still manage to catch a good price.

I wrote that which shifts with the time also. but it did not seem to be usefull so far  
This one which stays untill a day turns could be shifted by hours manually, just to adjust (and "tune") the start of the day (broker time + shift)

I like to use few time frame to find out the retracement. I use 1 hour and 15 minutes. The 1 hour can show a the the end of trend. Normally I look for the stochastic to reach 90 level and cross. That is the sign of retracement. Than I look for short time frame to see if they are any new cross at the bottom to take for bullish bias. Don't worry... you have to study a lot of pattern than you understand. Take your time. While you trade with me, you will learn more. Make sure, take some notes every time you find a new things. That's how I started.

If I am not mistaken, your's Pivot Points provide in the system. I have that also with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") platform but I don't use it because is different reading and confuse me a lot. So I stop using it and just remain using from Action Forex Pivot Point.  
This help me a lot. Easy for me. I just need to follow-up every hour.  
Just use this website;  
[http://www.actionforex.com/forex_ana..._200603215756/](http://www.actionforex.com/forex_analysis_and_forecasts/pivot_points/gbpusd_200603215756/)  
  
I hope this will help you.

I believe some of you manage to take 100 pips for GBP. Is a good move.  
I don't take during Asian Session.   
I take during London n NY session only.  
  
If I want to trade Asian Session, I will trade USD/JPY.

That is the sign of retracement. Than I look for short time frame to see if they any new cross at the bottom to take for bullish bias. Don't worry... you have to study a lot of pattern than you understand. Take your time. While you trade with me, you will learn more. Make sure, take some notes every time you find a new things.

Yes.. is going to retrace now. I can see 1 one show retracement, if you see from 30 minutes a bit clear. Try to see from a few time frame.  
I use fibocacci also sometimes to find out how much retracement can go.  
Fibonacci is good also. Is a leading indicator.

Bullish still stronger.  
May be we can go to 2.0635 (R3 Daily PP).  
Now is the time for retracement.   
I will wait for London Open.  
I will use the new PP at 7GMT.

I am sorry...  
I forgot to inform you all about the Stochastic has different setting for different time frame.  
  
For 1 hour chart - use Stochastic 14,3,3  
  
For 15 minutes chart - use Stochastic 5,3,3

My advice you better take mini lot;  
  
1 lot = 100/200 units  
  
so, 3 lots is 300/600 units

hebsh,  
  
You should know how much is your max risk first.  
If you know how much than you plan how much to buy.  
Check the ratio also.

We can't trade anything by now.  
Even during the news release, the price doesn't move much.  
Just about 40 pips only.  
  
From now...the price will be neutral/sideway.  
  
I will came back during NY session.

hi Olaha:  
thank for share your sys and teaching.  
My question is :by the rule say when price above (below)3 PP level we go   
buy (short) .Today the daily PP is 2.0429 it is far away,so now we do not   
have chance to short ,trade buy only before the price go down below the  
daily PP (2.0429).  
Do i understand right?  
thank again

Yes... that's the way we look for the trend.  
We look for buy market only today.  
Unless the price break the PP level on Daily and 4 hours.  
This way is save.  
We have to see the price above or below all 3 PP go to same direction.  
Yes...you are a good student...follow the rule.  
Good Luck!

80% winners  
20% losers.  
  
I can't say 100% perfect.  
This rule, very rare I get lost because my rule is every 15 to 20 pips move, I move my SL to b/e or +3.  
If you don't follow the rule, yes.. you will get a lot of reverse your position.

This is for the next news;  
  
Wednesday, July 18th, 2007 (10:00 a.m. New York Time) USA  
At 10 a.m. NY time we have Bernanke talking and giving his semiannual testimony. Everybody expects him to be hawkish, and if he drops his hawkish tone, I think we may possibly see GBP/USD gain 50 pips or more in the first hour of the report. On the other hand, if he remains in a similar hawkish tone like before, most likely it will be too dangerous to trade but the way to trade his testimony will largely depend on BOE minutes and U.S. CPI reading. If you are new to this, I suggest you to skip the testimony because it may be a little bit too tricky.

No..that is correct (the PP level).   
During new release is like that.  
Don't compare the trend with other pairs during the news release.

Wait for 4.30 news..  
  
General direction will be Bullish.. but just give a space for the news release to retrace. Than we take Buy... remember... look for 1 hour and 15 minutes Stochastic retracement.  
  
Good Luck!

I don't take anything now...  
I will wait for next New PP at 9 GMT.  
This news release doesn't give much move. 30 pips only.  
  
Let the price settle 1st.  
  
Just be passion...

Since the price can't break the 511,  
now we look for bearish trend.  
  
We can take at S1 level 480.

EUR/JPY is good currency to follow if you don't like to follow the news release because this pair currency doesn't effect much on any news release.

In 1 hr, the stochastic show that want to retrace, u better wait for another 30 minutes, if the next candle continue than take it..  
  
For save side... u can take at 168.70, With stochastic confirmation (15 minutes chart)

Actually I am not sure either hebsh sell or buy.  
I think.. buy entry.  
He shouldn't enter at that time because no signal yet on buy entry  
that time. He knows his mistake.  
  
On the time he send me the message, I was offline.   
After 2 hours, I came back to online.  
Than I see his message.  
Is too late to ask.  
When I send a message to ask either buy/sell he didn't reply.  
Is to bad, I can't help him.  
If I am not mistaken,   
he enter 4 lots mini account.  
So, 20 pips SL is just nice.  
  
I don't know where is hebsh now...he is missing.  
I hope he will back today.

Great way of thinking... Thanx first of all.  
  
What I don't get that if the price is above R1 or below S1 then shoud we take the trade from R2 or S2...  
I am lost in this.

2 **hebsh**  
  
Good entry i guess.. Try to catch your profit at 2.07 or even above  
  
SL may seem a bit tight though

Actually is very simple rule that you should follow;  
  
Look for PP level for Daily, 4 hrs, hourly.  
If the price is above the Pivot for Daily, 4 hrs and hourly =bullish  
If the price is below the Pivot for Daily, 4 hrs and hourly =bearish  
  
The entry at R1 for buy/ S1 for Sell (4 hrs PP)  
SL will be at Pivot level for either buy or sell.  
With confirmation from Stochastic.  
  
I think... you need to read again on page 1 of this thread to get better understanding.

What do u mean the SL a bit tight?  
  
He bought 4 lots (mini lots).  
Let say 1 lot 1000 unit  
20 pips is 20$ for 1 lot  
If 4 lots = $80   
Is a big money for him friends...

It depends on what is counted as a lot\or unit .. Say when i sell\buy 1 lot through my broker i sell\buy $1k ( 1 pp = $0.1, 4 lots -> 1pp=$0.4 and so on.. )  
  
As to the rules.. I see it the following way  
  
If the day open above a pivot, then set an enter around a pivot ( the price always runs to pivot prior to moving to R1 etc. Watch some days for it and you'll see it's true 90% of time)  
SL - under S1  
  
R\R ratio is 1:1 in this case, with the possibility to rise higher..  
  
More profitable is such a case :  
  
If the price crossed the pivot not reaching 1st R or S - then it 99% will reach opposite S or R **3** (respectively)  
Say it opened under the pivot, fell a bit but did not reach the S1 then went up above a pivot (and it happened at the past part of eu session, not earlier) - it always goes to #3 level in such cases .. That's all

As what I always mention, the entry at R1 or S1 but I don't enter on the spot... I always remind to wait for retracement to get confirmation. If the price came back to Pivot means no trade. But if the price been to R1/S1 and retrace above the pivot than came back again to R1/S1.. the price will not came back to Pivot level again. Because the price always test the strength at R1/S1 level. If the price agree than the price will continue to go to R2 and R3 or S2 and S3 (4 hours PP).  
  
I hope this will convince you....

Dear Vasyan and everybody,  
  
My advice to you... you should use the system that you believe in.  
Everybody has own style of trading. If you don't comfortable/believe this system.. don't follow.  
  
I believe.. the success trader is a person that believe their own system.

I thought you are not interested to learn my system?  
  
For those who are regular to follow-up my system will know.  
  
Like Leo221, he's very positive with this system.  
I don't mind to teach someone has a positive minded on this system.

My advice.. don't take because the retracement is not clear.  
I think..now will be sideway already for EUR.  
  
The daily PP is 2.0498. The PP broke already on earlier up to 2.0512. That is just for the test off Pivot area.  
Since the 4 hrs and hourly PP level is match, is win direction for bullish (at 2 Pivot level match).

Leo,  
  
Always make sure the price retest around R1 or S1 before enter the market.  
For the save side, use the 4hrs pivot.

I am happy to hear that you can follow the system.  
Normally the price will not follow the range at 4H because the big move happen during the news release. So we have to look for Daily range.  
During the news release.. esp. during major news, I try to take short term trades. Not more than 30 minutes, because anything can be happen during the 1 hr period. Once everybody take out profit, the price can reverse.   
I hope this answer may help you for the future decision.  
  
Good Luck!

Dear Steven,  
  
Thank you for your question.  
Please don't confuse...  
  
The answer for your question;  
To enter the market either buy or sell is depends on the PP level.  
  
If the price above the PP level for daily... bullish  
price below the PP level for daily...bearish  
  
When we know either bullish or bearish...  
than we have to wait until the price retest the R1 for buy,  
S1 for sell. (4 hrs or 1 hr Pivot)  
  
After the price retest the R1 for buy or S1 for sell - make sure the price doesn't retrace at Pivot level.  
  
If the price doesn't retrace the Pivel level than we enter at R1 for buy and S1 for sell.  
  
If the price retrace at Pivot level than wait for next retracement.  
  
Try not to use this system during the news release.  
  
I hope this explanation may help you.  
  
Let me know if you do not understand.  
  
Good Luck!

When you say the price above the PP level for bullsih or below the PP level for bearish -- What price are you talking about? the CURRENT price of the market at whatever time you are looking at it? Or the price that the candlestick opens at? That's what I don't get.

Okay. Olaha, I'm going to make another post after this one with an "example" using the gbp/usd. Going to go do it now, so you can see it and tell me if I'm doing it right or not.

Okay. So suppose you start at 6:45 EST (15m candle - open 1.9817)  
  
Daily PP - 1.9847  
4h PP - 1.9814  
Hourly PP - 1.9797  
  
Would you conisder this bearish since its below the Daily Pivot? Or would you just not trade this until the Price was either below or above all the pivot points for a stronger sense of trend?

Another thing - When you are talking about scaling and taking profits every 20 pips....  
  
Say the range from R1 to R3 is 40 pips. Lets use R1 = 1.9800 R2 = 1.9820 R3 = 1.9840.  
  
Do you:  
a) buy 2 lots when you enter the market at 1.9800? Then close 1 lot at 1.9820 (20 pip profit) then close the 2nd lot at 1.9840 (40 pip profit)?   
b) buy 1 lot at 1.9800 and close it out at 1.9820 then buy another lot at 1.9820 and set your SL at 1.9800 and take profit at 1.9840?  
  
If it is (b) then how do you know the market will keep going up? You just keep going til it stops you out?

In this case,  
If you look at hourly...  
You could enter buy at R1 - 1.9817 and take profit at 1.9853  
The price tested at R1 than retrace at 1.9810.  
This is the good example for short term trade.

What do you mean? there is no R1 - 1.9817, and how do you take profit at 1.9853 - thats not a number on the PP chart??

Don't understand, because for exit strategy you said use 4 hour R1,R2,R3? (for bullish)  
  
Quote from 1st post:   
Exit Strategy;  
  
For buy - use 4 hours PP level (R1,R2,R3) for exit level,  
For sell - use 4 hours PP level (S1,S2,S3) for exit level.

If you are daily trader, you can wait 4 to 8 hours trading... you can take 4 hrs pivot.  
If you are short term, just few hours trader like 1 to 2 hrs trader than use 1 hr pivot

In this case... the price still move in the range.  
I'm waiting for the 4 hrs pivot. This may give a big move soon if the price remain above 1.9814. The price already tested at R1 - 1.9868.  
So if the price remain above 1.9814, just wait for the break R1 to enter.  
I just make order on R1 at this moment.

How'd you make an order on R1? the 4 Hour R1 hasn't been hit yet. Most recent High is 1.9866

Well if it alreayd hit 1.9868 then why didn't you enter? Do you wait for the candle to close above 1.9868 with the body of the candle, and not just the wick?

As I say earlier... let the price test the price at R1 first. Then see the retracement... make sure the retracement doesn't came back at the Pivot point. Currently the pivot is 1.9814.  
  
Currently the price already hit the Pivot level. Means...the price is weak..  
I close all my order.

**Sorry if I'm asking too many questions, but it seems you have been extremely successful and I just want to pick your brain as much as possible =p**  
  
Okay, so you ALWAYS let it test R1 or S1, then wait for a retracement back to Pivot level. If it does NOT hit the pivot level and goes back up to R1 or S1, then when it hits the R1 or S1 - you enter the market then?

May be now.. we look for bearish.  
  
  
Follow-up the hourly pivot;  
Let the price test at S1 - 1.9797  
Make sure the retracement below 1.9822.  
Take profit up to R3 1.9722

Okay, now since we are watching the 15m Time Frame. The Stoch is 5,3,3 and the EMA is 5? When you trade off the Hourly Pivot do you use 15m TF? When you trade off the 4 Hour Pivot do you use 15m TF or 60m TF?

If I trade 4 hrs pivot... I use 15 minutes chart TF.(Stoch 5,3,3 and EMA 5)  
If I trade hourly pivot... I use 1 minutes chart TF. (Stoch 5,3,3 only)

> Okay, now since we are watching the 15m Time Frame. The Stoch is 5,3,3 and the EMA is 5? When you trade off the Hourly Pivot do you use 15m TF? When you trade off the 4 Hour Pivot do you use 15m TF or 60m TF?

so based on this, let me see if i can call the trades and please correct me if im wrong on this.   
  
right now the price is around 1.9850  
  
it is clearly above all pivot points.   
  
4 hr PP = 1.9819 and R1 = 1.9833. so if the market opens we will wait for price to move below 1.9833 and without touching 1.9819, if price retrace to R1, then we enter at R1.  
  
1 hr PP = 1.9821 and R1 = 1.9829. so we wait for market to retrace below 1.9829 and then without touching 1.9821 when price comes back to R1 we enter.   
  
so those are the trades i see for the 4 hr and 1 hr. my question now is what happens when we refresh and those values for PP and R1 change, do we keep referencing our old values or just abandon everything and look at the new numbers? how do we react to the new values?   
  
thanks

I think... you can be a good student. You understand the system now.  
You just need to learn to be a discipline student.. to follow the rule and be master on the money management.  
  
If the value change.... we have to change our order also. It could be +/-. Thats why we must check the value of PP every hour.

In this case now... we can't do anything.  
We have to wait for new value.  
May be we have to take the next hour value.  
In case the price break 1.9855 we can place our take profit level up to 1.9900 at R1 Daily (If the break happen before the next hour).

definitely need to be disciplined to make it in this business.   
  
1 hr PP = 1.9829, R1 = 1.9837 at 07:00 GMT  
  
price retraced to 1.9836 and there was a bullish cross of stoch (5,3,3) below 50 line. so i entered at 1.9840.   
R3 = 1.9849, so i used that as TP. this is all based on 1 hr pivot levels. my SL is set 3 pips below PP, so it is 1.9826. Am i doing this right?

Yes that is correct... good example but look back at the figure. Enter at 1.9840 and exit at 1.9849... just about 9 pips. That is not worth to take. This is westing time to trade. Try look for a big move, about 20 to 40 pips.  
Sometimes even 1 hr pivot give about 20-60 pips. That is the sign that the market is active. If the pivot figure is small is mean that the market is slow. Take note of this.

Yes...9 pips can be a lot of money if you buy 1 million.  
If your trade 10 pips everyday with 1 million also enough for the day.  
That whats banks did it!

this is where i have another question. sorry for all the questions.   
  
price is around 1.9850, and PP = 1.9841, R1 = 1.9861. price has not yet traded above R1. in this case what do we do? do we enter immediately price touches R1 or do we have to wait for price to cut pass R1 and then do the whole retrace thing again before we enter?  
thanks

Morning Olaha, and traders. Olaha, I'm starting to understand it a lot more, thank you so much for taking the time yesterday to answer all my questions ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). My question now becomes, say we enter at R1, then the PP updates, what do we do then?  
  
a) Follow the old PP chart.  
b) use the new PP chart.  
  
??

We must wait until the price test the R1 and retrace. When the price back to R1 than we enter if the retracement is above the pivot.

No...we have to follow the new target only.   
  
Let say you already entered buy at R1. The next hr.. the PP change than you just need to update you take profit level to the new figure. If you happy with the earlier target than leave it. But the SL you should follow the new PP levels.

Range is 37 pips. So if you do enter do you take your profit at R2 then again at R3 or do you still take it at 20 pips? Then 17pips for the 2nd profit?

The 8:56 GMT candlestick hit a low of 1.9827 - would you consider that testing the S1? (1.9825) or does it have to hit the 1.9825 to "test" it, right now it is retracing back to PP

Currently the price already break the pivot level at hourly.  
For short term the price became weak or reverse.  
If the price want to reverse... let the price test the S1 first.  
Lets wait and see.  
If this doesn't happen for the next hour... I close my window and go to shopping...he... he... he..

I just trade GBP/USD only.  
Most of the time I trade once. If the market active, I trade max 2 times.  
Try to focus 1 pair and don't over trade.

price went down to 9829 and then shot back up on my platform, so looking at the 4 hr PP which is 9819 and R1 which is 9833, i think that was a buy trade there. R3 is 9855, so the range is about 22pips.

Seems... the price is everywhere.... i might stop from now..  
I don't see any trend at this moment.  
  
For long term... still bullish.  
May be tmrw then we can see the clear bullish.

If you want to use daily pivot... look for 3 hrs and 1 hr chart.   
Normally.. I use daily for active market... esp like NFP or major news.  
because this news release give a big range.

based on 4hr pivot, it just hit R1, retracing back to pivot now? if it retraces and stays above 1.9841 then hits R1 again, enter with SL at pivot = 1.9841.   
  
Range from R1- R3 = 36, so 2 lots if equity management allows it.  
  
Take first lot at 1.9881, second at 1.9897?

why you have to wait for testing again... look at 3 hours ago... the price already tested.  
  
we can enter at R1 aready.  
  
Take first lot at 1.9881, second at 1.9897 ( correct)

You are correct...   
Actual was after retracement just now.  
I hope you can see the retracement happen few minutes ago.  
Remember this is good trade.  
  
For your all information,  
The pivot for Daily and 4 hrs is can be use during news release.

Ya, i saw the retracement a few minute ago. but what I was asking is.. How do you know when the retracement is finished? As soon as it tests the R1, then goes down, the moment it comes back up and hits R1 again - thats the end of retracement?

In this case is different... this is the news release.  
Is not advisable to take this trade for those new to trading.  
I like to use 30 second and 1 minute chart to see the retracement during the news release. The price also retrace above the pivot for daily, 4 hrs and hourly. That is great...

hmmm.. so if you are trading 4hr pivot on 15m time frame.. once it hits the R1 /S1 on the 15m time frame, you then go to the 1m charts to watch for retracement? or what?

I am using Oanda. I use chart that provided by Oanda.  
By using my system, you don't need to use complicated charting system.  
Bcoz my system base on price.  
Try to use simple chart. Less confusion and easy to trade.

Olaha, question - I was just watching the graphs. Here is what happened...  
  
4 hour pivot = 1.9869  
R1 = 1.9901  
R2 = 1.9936  
R3 = 1.9968  
  
Range = 67 (20/20/20/7)  
  
Price hit R1 and then retraced to 1.9877. Then price rallied back up and broke through R1 and took profit at 20 pips, then adjusted stop loss to 5 above R1 (1.9906). Then the market fell and took out my stop loss and fell to a low of 1.9891 (below R1). Price then rallied again and took out R1 and went to a current High of 1.9923 .  
  
My question is... Since it fell back below R1 after taking me out, at break even + 20 pips that I locked, should I have entered back when it rallied up past R1 and done the same thing? - All the pivot levels were the same, none had changed.

Yes you can do that, as long the price doesn't retrace back at pivot level.  
You can take again at R1 but just becareful bcoz sometimes the price can reverse crazy. Sometimes that happen. Take note of this.  
It's happen to me a few times. Some can be a good move.. big range.  
If this happen, look back at news release. Sometimes, this happen bcoz of Oil price adjustment or some speech happen. Read as much news as possible. Update yourself. Just be aware what happening around the world. Esp. for US matters.

Olaha.. Look at 4 hour pivot..  
  
PP = 1.9955  
R1 = 1.9975  
R2 = 1.9994  
R3 = 2.0014  
  
Price reached R1, retraced back to 1.9956. And now pulling back up, if price reaches R1 again, good time to enter? Range = 39, 2 lots 20/19 ??  
  
Edit: Nevermind, price just dropped bellow PP.

just curious here. what about the daily Pivots. we have R1 tested and there has been a retracement back to R1. do we even consider the daily like this one. the only problem i will have with this is the pp is very far from R1 and so our stop loss will be very big. what do you all think?

I was watching the daily from yesterday, the PP is way too far from R1 for me personally. Up to you and what is okay within your equity management range.

Actually, In my chart.. the price retrace at 1.9945.  
  
For info: the retracement must be more than 10 gape from the PP to R1 for buy and PP to S1 for sell.  
  
Edit : Sorry.. the retracement 10 gape above pivot for bullish and below pivot for bearish.

So you wouldnt think about shorting the GBP? If it were to hit S1, retrace (s1 to pp is only 13 pips), then hit S1 again?

P=1.9951  
S1=1.9938  
  
The price were touch S1 than retrace at p level so.. this is not the signal yet  
  
look at 1 minutes chart. Than you can see clear retracement.

Ya I know. But what I mean is.. since the range from pp to s1 is only 13 pips, chances are it will retrace within 10 pips of pp, so would you enter if it retraced within that area and then hit s1 again?

Hourly PP - 1.9966 S1 - 1.9954  
Price was already below S1 earlier, and it came back up, went 1 pip from new pivot, if it goes back down to S1, do you enter? Or wait for it to hit S1, then retrace (since new pivot and S1), then hit S1 again and enter?  
  
And another thing I was wondering, suppose you are in a trade and have not taken profit yet at 20pips - then the pivots and R's and S's change, what do you do?

The price just hit S1.. I didn't see any retracement yet.  
Let the price hit S1 and retrace below Pivot.  
  
I think...this question already ask by someone. Pls read again at the past post;  
If you are in a trade and the pivot change, you just need to adjust your take profit level and SL. If you happy with your earlier target than leave it.

Well that trade woulda met your system wouldn't it? Hit S1, retraced (didn't hit pivot) then hit S1 again (enter short) then it went and hit pivot (stop loss) - wouldnt the pivot be stop loss?

But if you look at 15m chart for 4 hour pivots, it hit R1, and hasn't retraced yet, so how do you get an enter at R1?

nice trade today. i used the new pivots and got in at around 1.9991 and took a ride all the way to 2.0041. this is just an excellent system.   
I have a question for you Olaha when you come back tomorrow. i was following you as you entered the trade below. the fact that you took 36 pips means that you entered right at R1 which was 1.9975 when i look at the 1 min chart i see a retracement and it is confirmed when price is at 1.9986 that is when the 1 min stoch crosses up and price just shoots from there onwards. so how did you enter at 1.9975?  
  
great pips.

Congratulation... How many pips you manage to take?  
  
May I know what setting of stochastic in 1 minutes chart you use?

Do you know that sometimes bcoz of you browser load your data very slow, you could missing some data. I don't know why you can't see the cross.  
  
Actually I place an order. Once the price test the R1, then retrace... I place an order immediately. So I get that price. If.. in case the price hit the pivot... I will cancel the order. That's why I get the price.  
  
Next time, I will take the picture where I entered.

one question:as yestreday 4hR1 was 1.9975 ,when we bought if we should wait price showed like 1.9975/1.9978,so we got 1.9978.is this right?

It's depend on your spread my dear... some broker give up to 4 pips spread...  
  
my spread only 2.5..  
  
So if the price ASK 1.9975, so my BID 1.9977.  
  
But if your spread is 4,  
So you will get Bid 1.9979

i manage to take 20 pip for the 1st lot,  
when the price move up... I place my SL at +20.  
So... I close my 2nd lot at +20 SL (2.0038)  
  
I hope some of you manage to do the same.

Once we know when is the best time to trade, we should know what is the trend for the day. The easy way to find the direction of the trend for the days is using the Pivot Point (PP). If the opening price is above the PP means Bullish. If the opening price is below the PP means Bearish.  
  
  
hi olaha:  
in this you said the ''open price''.it mean what time is price?  
thx

Dear Olaha,  
  
I have been an ardent fan of Pivot Points (daily pivots) & Fibs... and have been trading them for the last six months with decent results...  
Your thread has some priceless suggestions to improve my trading...  
  
Will try and modify my simple pivot trading method to suit yours and be able to get better results.  
Will let you know how it goes.  
Keep up the good work Olaha. God bless ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f911.png?v=15.1) .

Okay since this is my 1st attempt to understand the way olaha trade  
  
I'll try to make my own view about today  
since price is already try R1 today and goes back below pivot in 4hrs chart so it is not confirm yet to do the trade am i right ??  
  
Open Price is above pivot on 4 hrs and 1 hrs  
so it's moderate bullish for today, am i doing this rite ????

I got in at 2.0174. Let me tell you why.   
when the market opened today at 7 gmt, the 4 hr PP = 2.0157 and R1 = 2.0174, R3 = 2.0220  
  
see if you look at the charts you will see that price retraced down to 2.0171 and then retraced back up. thats when i entered. i will close first order at 2.0194 and then move second order to BE. Lets see how the market reacts.

For long term strategy... u r right....  
But today is holiday for GBP/USD... so no trade...  
Next time.. before you start trade, check your calender first.  
  
If you have any open trade... pls close at "break even" or minimize your loss or take small profit (5-10 pips)

Dear Olaha,  
  
I would like to join your club. I found your trading systems on this forum and I think they both are great. First I red your first thread “**Simple Trading system for Intraday/short term** ” and I was having pretty good results with it on paper trading.   
Now I am reading this Pivot Point system and I am trying to learn the way you trade.   
Thank you. All the best.  
  
Rodrigo.

Yes.. bullish trend for the day.  
Thats means.. we have to wait for the 1 hr pivot became bullish.  
Than we can enter the trade.

Ok good.  
  
If you want to try in real also can, but try with a small unit.  
May be can try 100 units to 500 units.  
Trade in real can bring more confident and discipline.

Dear Olaha,  
  
I would like to ask you some questions. Why did you change the first system to the “Pivot Point with Money Management Strategy?” I was getting good results with the first system and I was surprised how accurrate the fibo levels were and the stochastic and RSI worked well.   
I am sure that this Pivot Point system works well too.   
Is this system more accurate and profitable than the previous one? Or does it give more trading opportunities during the day?   
The stochastic that you use is it stochastic slow or fast?  
Thank you   
  
Rodrigo.

Yes that was a good system but the this pivot more accurate and can help me to make a good trade with discipline.   
  
Pivot system give me more trade rather than the previous system.  
  
In my platform.. they name it as Full Stochastic 5,3,3  
In my system, I have Full, Fast and Slow Stochastic.  
If you use [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile") broker, you will see this.  
I don't know about others.

Hi Olaha,  
  
Thank you. OK so it is if full stochastic. Yesterday I played with your system and I made some pips on GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. I hope that it was not just a coincidence ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1). I hope that it was because I followed all the rules.  
So the price was below daily PP, 4hPP and 1hPP so I expected that the price would go down. I was waiting for the moment when the price would reach the first 4 hour support (4hS1). When it happened the price stopped there for a moment and returned toward 4hPP. It did not reach the 4hPP so it was a good sign that it would go back to 4hS1.  
The price was moving up and down between the 4hS1 and a halfway to 4hPP (did not touch the 4hPP). I observed the Stoch 5,3,3 on 15 M chart. Both curves %K and %D crossed first (somewhere above 50) and then 5 EMA crossed the Stochastic but first it crossed the %K. Was it OK? If the EMA crosses the %K can it be considered as a confirmation?   
Then the price hit the 4hS1 again and when it continued to 4hS2 I entered the trade.  
Did I do it right? In a case like this does the stochastic 5,3,3 have to cross above 50 and go down on 15M chart? Does the stochastic 14,3,3 on 1h chart do the same or it does not matter? And is it enough if the EMA crosses the %K only? This is one thing I am not quite sure about.   
  
Rodrigo.

Seems... U understand the system.   
  
Actually... we don't have really consent on the technical indicator.  
The most important is the Pivot and the money management.  
The indicator is came at last.  
I use the indicator is for confirmation.  
I enter and exit the trade according to the Pivot only.  
For confirmation, than I look at the stochastic for retracement.  
For you all information, Technical analysis is legging indicator.  
So don't focus so much about it.  
Don't worry about where the line cross and etc.  
You can use the standard studies how to use the stochastic.  
  
One thing that you miss is where to enter.  
You should enter at S1 (after the retracement below the PP, than u should place an order at S1, and take profit at S3).  
  
Don't forget about the money management.  
  
My consent is money management.  
If you master on this, you can see the different on your trading style.

Olaha, say we get new PP and S1/R1 at 7:00GMT, if price has already tested the 7:00gmt S1 BEFORE 7:00GMT - say 6:45GMT - does that count as testing S1? Or do we have to wait for price to hit S1 DURING the pivot point time then wait for retrace then hit S1 again?

Now is short time bullish.  
Look at 1 hr pivot.  
Is abt 20 pips range.  
We still look for bearish now.  
Unless the price break the 2.0089,   
Than we have to look for bullish.  
I will inform latter.

If price were to retrace to around 2.0060, then hit 2.0064, you enter long?

That pivot still the same as previous hour.  
So the test at S1 earlier consider as a testing.  
Now.. we can place an order at S1.

Just look at the current price with the all Pivot level.  
Is very strong bearish.

Welcome to my tread.  
I will try to help you but the problem is I don't trade during New York session. I only trade during London session.  
Is abt 3pm our local time.  
  
If you want to follow-up, you have to be online from 3pm to 5pm.  
  
I understand, you work until 5 or 6 pm, is difficult to arrange.  
Try to understand the concept and rule.  
Than try to ask me question. I will try to answer the next day.  
After you understand than you start trade by yourself.  
I believe you can do that.

I get the pivot points from actionforex as mentioned in 1st post.  
  
The R1 pivot mentioned earlier is different now as it has changed, next time will capture a screenshot. 

I'm just moving clouds today - tomorrow I'll try mountains.

Sorry S-Deuce,  
  
I can't trade for the last few days.  
I have something to do.  
Anywhere, I believe most of you can trade with your own already.

Dear all,  
  
I'm so happy last week was a good trading day.  
I just feel sad that, I can't be online in this forum to share with you all.  
I just got time to trade for few minutes or an hour than I logout.  
  
After reading at fundamental side.... I think....the market will be a bit slow for this week. We have to wait until next week Tuesday, after US Interest rate announcement. Than from that.. we will get a good range of trading.  
Anywhere... just wait and see... if we have a chance to take a small range 10-20 pips everyday... if u don't mind...still better than nothing..end of the week can get 100 pips.

Price tested hourly R1, but then news release and hit pivot, if price hits R1 again would you enter olaha - since it retraced due to news announcement?

Olaha, with [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), is there a way to have the candlesticks be based off of bid price? (I know there is a button that will draw a line and show what the bid price is.) But I want the candlesticks themselves to be based off bid price and not off of the average price.

Yes.. Oanda has a button to change the ask/average/bid price on candle.  
This is very useful.

We have to use daily pivot to know the major direction.  
For daily pivot, show bearish  
The price move below PP.  
During 6 GMT, the price below pivot for 4hr/1hr (Bearish)  
After 8-10 GMT, the price above pivot for 4hr/1r (Bullish)

no...bcoz small range..

Small range is very risky.

Just wait and see...either one... s1 or r1

Olaha, why you take that trade? If range was only 24 pips? 2.0177 - 2.0153? Thought you said you only trade if range is from 30-50??

I calculate the range for 4 hrs.  
I enter at 1 hr S1  
My target at 4 hrs s3 but the price reject at 1 hr S3.  
So.. I close at 167

Hello Olaha,  
  
thanks for explaining your strategy.  
  
I have a question about when to enter  
  
"If the price above the PP level Daily, 4 hrs, hourly, we can enter at R1 hourly PP."  
  
I understand, that the price must be greater than the 3 pp levels and in this case I go long.  
  
Is that correct ?

Is very easy system to follow actually.  
  
If the price above the pivot- bullish,  
If the price below the pivot - bearish,  
  
The entry strategy is;  
For buy:  
Let the price test the R1 first for buy, after the price retrace, make sure the price retrace above the Pivot. If the price back to R1, than we enter buy.  
  
For sell:  
Let the price test the S1 first for sell, after the price retrace, make sure the price retrace below the Pivot. If the price back to S1, than we enter sell.  
  
The daily, 4 hrs, hourly pivot is very important.  
Normally.. I will use the hourly and 4 hr pivot for short-term entry.  
To get a major direction- use daily pivot.  
  
The range from R1-3 and S1-3, must be on big range.  
Is around 30 - 100. If this happen... we can start plan,   
how much lots you want to enter.  
  
Don't worry... soon latter...you will know how to use this system.  
  
Good Luck!

nice strategy,  
it would be much easier if you have the pivot calculator, I think you can have one for free at the blog earnforex.  
  
Recently I also have one friend recommend me to use [Forex Profit System](http://www.profitguideforex.com), which also use pivot techniques, however I have not tried yet. Is there anyone here used it before? If yes, please share experience

hi smarttrader,  
I have used it for 2 months. great results, last month i made 20/23 winning trades. it doesnt use technical indicators alone but it is a combo of candle patterns and tech indicators.   
and the mentoring is great. I sent email to ask question and immediately got reply from support team

sure, i don't mind  
the system uses the engulfing candlestick pattern, combined with the 3 EMAs and Stochastic indicators, can use 5 mins, 15mins or 1 hour chart.  
  
but I think you can buy it, because it comes a long with a lot of bonuses,e.g Fx National Live, and you can download a lot of EAs

I am prefer to get a free system.  
I hope you can share with us what is the system about with more details.  
Please share with us the charting setting with picture and explanation.

up to you, bro  
there is no free lunch in this world, so sometimes free system is not good, rite?  
i am a little bit busy and i am not so familiar with capturing the chart, then cutting it, then posting it here, maybe i will figure out and do that some other times

Look for the attachment.  
  
  
Additional rule;  
**_To find the right price._**  
Before we calculate a pivot point, we should know to identify the right price to take. Look for valid bar/candlestick.   
  
**_The valid bar/candlestick is ;_**  
For Bullish - close price higher-high,  
For Bearish - close price lower-low.  
  
**Notes: Use Daily/Weekly/Monthly chart.

I just would like to share with everybody about the MACD Divergence..  
This method of reading divergence may help us to make a good entry and exit decision together with our Pivot Point system.

Are you guys still looking for pivot calculators? They're all over the place. The generic floor pivots formula is:  
  
H = previous high  
L = previous low  
C = previous close  
  
P = (H+L+C)/3  
R1 = (2*P)-L;  
S1 = (2*P)-H;  
R2 = P + H - L;  
S2 = P - H - L;  
R3 = (2*P) + (H - (2*L));  
S3 = (2*P) - ((2*H)-L);   
  
This applies for any periods, including hourly, 4-hr, 12-hr, daily, 5 min, whatever.  
  
Just get an indicator and plug in the formulas and you're good to go. I could do this in 5 minutes with the indicators I have here. Good luck and I hope this helps!

Thank you for your feedback.  
I know the formula and had it in my spreed sheet format.   
I am looking for the Pivot Point Calculator something like Microsoft Windows using. They have window EXE file. This system can be use on offline and open in small window. So far, I can't find any with Mac. I hope someone could help me with this. That will be great to have it.

This way you have to type in OHLC for each hour... I know you're using a MAC, but if you use something like metatrader you can just code it onto your charts... so much easier.

Thx.. I think..I have to switch to Microsoft windows or upgrade my Mac to Window Vista then I can use metatrader or something similar.  
  
Currently, I have no choice to calculate the pivot every hour, 3 hour and daily. Then, draw a line on the chart. A bit troublesome but what I can do. That only the choice that I have.   
  
I hope, if any programmer here can do the software for Mac will be good.  
  
I believe, one day.. there will be....

Hi   
Thank you for your reply.  
I'll try to demo this system,and if i have any question i wont hestate to ask you.  
Is it that people are losing hope on the system or they have exhausted the ideas on this system?  
Lots of pips is my wish to everybody.

I am sorry..disappear for a long time.  
I just came back from planet Mars.. hehe...  
I find a good charting system that can help to trade successfully.  
I think...some of you knew about wave59. ([www.wave59.com](http://www.wave59.com)).  
This system is just wonderful but just need time to be master of the system.  
Too advance... so we need time to study properly.  
  
Please give some feedback/share about the Wave59 system if anyone of you already using it.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Regards,  
Betty

At the same time...when I was at Mars.. I realise...something interesting in the Pivot point system...  
  
I think..some of you don't know that Pivot Point has a few types of calculation formula. There are; PP Clasic, PP Woodie's, PP Camarilla, and PP DeMark's.  
  
I find that PP Camarilla one of the tools that help on target projection.  
  
Who's interested to experimenting and adventuring... have a look at this website;..  
<http://www.earnforex.com/pivot_points_calculator.php>  
  
Good Luck!

Look at current trend for EUR/USD..  
Compare at the PP level for Camarilla.  
I think the price at the level of R4,  
and the DeMark's show that level was the higher.  
  
I hope this may help you to start with.  
  
Good Luck..

For those who confuse taking HLC price,  
you can use HLC price from AF.  
For the Current Open Price,   
look for at 6pm EST at current Day.  
  
To calculate PP level for HLC.. we use previous day,  
for open price.. we use on the current day.  
  
I hope you all understand this.  
  
Wish you all the best..

I just went through the Metatrader system.  
Seems like a lot of them using Pivot in the system.  
I believe those who knows using the Meta4 and apply the system that I shared will doing better. The system can give alert. I hope someone that expert in this area can share some of the signal.  
  
Thank you.

Hi Dagoods, Sorry... take a long time to reply... I've been away from this forum for a such long time. Anywhere.. about the system that I suggested. The rules as follow; For Buy: 1). For Bullish trend - The price must be above daily and 1 hr Pivot Point. 2). When 1 hr pivot point move upward to a new level, move higher than the previous pivot hour, this is good signal entry for buy. 3). For confirmation entry, we have to get the second candle confirmation as a bullish candle or wait for new Retracement at above new pivot point. 4). All setting is in 15 minutes chart. For Sell: (Just reverse the Buy signal) For target level- we can use R1,R2,R3 or according to our own money management. Hope this will help you to understand. I try to make it simple as possible.

Here's a good read on this subject. It's an e-book. I look at a chart in a whole different way now.

Hello, good approach to get some pips when market opens. Just need to know one thing  
what if price if between Daily, 1HR and 4Hr pp. do you wait for price to close either above all PP or below all PP  
e.g if when market opens at 8am GMT say price is below daily PP below 1HR PP and above 4HR PP and at 9.15 it goes below all (1HR, 4HR and daily ) PP but 9.15 there is new 1HR pp. my question is would you consider 1HR PP of 8am (when market opens ) or 9.15 am (current 1HR PP). hope that make sense.   
  
pp = pivot points  
  
Thanks
