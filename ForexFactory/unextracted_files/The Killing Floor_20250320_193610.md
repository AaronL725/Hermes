**Welcome to The Killing Floor!**  
Please keep all chat that does not use this strategy or pair in another thread. Our the strategy may change from time to time, but for the most part, it will remain very constant. If it does change, there will be a statistical reason why. Many will say this is too simple and there is no way it works… Frankly, I don’t care because I get paid in pips, not opinions. The evidence of profitably from the entries generated by the system is provided.  
  
**Why Is It Called The Killing Floor?**  
Most people who step foot on the market floor each and every day die there. They spend all day sharpening their tools but never practicing their techniques. As a result, they are food for the wolves. Nine times out of ten, it’s not the strength of your weapon that matters, but your ability to maximize its utility.  
The goal each day is to hit the floor as hard as you can killing as many pips as possible. Some days you get killed on the floor, but most days you should walk off the battlefield drenched in the pips of your foes.  
  
  
_**Tools of Our System:**_  
**Pairs:** EURUSD & USDJPY  
**Time Frame:** 5 Minute   
**Indicators:**  
\- 200 MA  
\- 50 MA  
\- 10 MA   
[Click Here to Download MT4 MA That Displays Slope Color](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11182625#post11182625)  
  
**Risk Management:**  
\- 36 Pip SL  
\- 4 Pip TP  
\- Max 1:1 Leverage Per Order.  
\- Not Having FIFO Helps. If you are in US, you can get around it using [Oanda](/brokers/oanda "View OANDA Broker Profile"), you just need to make sure the size of each trade is different (1000, 1001, 1002, 1003)  
\- Ideally, Your [Spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide") are <= 0.5 Pips.  
\- - Any spreads over 1.5 pips will be very hard to overcome.  
\- - All Charts Below Assume 1.5 pip spread. If your spread is lower than this, expect much better results.  
\- Absolute Max Hold Time: 1000 Candles (Roughly 3.5 days)   
\- - Ideally, you should not get stuck holding a trade this long.

_**Important Notes**_  
****If****you try to 100% automate this system, you will get very different results. The trade management is key. You need to know when to stack entries, adjust all order TPs to the furthest orders 4 pip TP, cut losers, and most importantly, you need to know when YOU need to stop trading based on things OUTSIDE the market. Like your mood, energy level, emotional state after huge streaks of wins or a few larger losses.****  
  
****If you would like to shoot for larger gains, pick up small 4 pip gains while you trade through that larger move to create some buffer for your account to handle drawdowns/reversals.****  
  
**Even though we have 7 possible entries, this does not mean you need to trade every single one every single time. In fact, don't... You will eat your margins like crazy. The main principle is you have a good idea of what is likely to happen next at any given time.**  
  
****The Stop Loss used is a hard stop for****worst-case****scenarios like you lose connection, terminal crashes, etc. You should cut your losses way before your hard stop is hit in MOST cases. That being said, it is okay to let the price****run against****you a bit as it will.****  
****Consider fundamentals please! Don’t Buy EU after Draghi announces no rate hike while Fed hiked a few days before. You will lose, and you could see this scenario coming from miles away.****  
  
****The slope****is down if the value of the MA on the last****candle****is higher than the value on the MA at the close of this candle. Vice Versa if the slope is up.****  
****Most fast moves of the market caused by news should take out your TP,****however****, if you get in a situation where they don’t during one of these spikes, take the time to book as much profit as you can and reduce your risk. If you can’t take everything off, take off as much as you can as****the price****is almost surely going to re-trace and provide you a great opportunity to re-enter.****  
  
****When in doubt… Remember the data. Pretty much all 7 entries will have****a 90****% chance hitting your target within 1 day (288 5 minute candles) of the entry, even ONLY trading with a 10 ma slope, regardless of fundamentals, sentiment, gut feel, everything. So chances are you will hit your target a lot. The key is to maximize those hits by stacking the position to bring up your average entry and get larger wins. Lowest entry was the first obviously, all my subsequent adds target that first target and use the same SL as the first order so the R****:R****gets better. See image below.****

_**How to Interpret Edge Analysis Images (EEI)**_  
We have 4 charts in our EEIs. 

  1. The first tells us the probability of the trade ending a profit if we were to close out after x bars after our entry signal.
  2. The second chart shows us our Edge Ratio using the entry signal in question with a max hold time of x based on the MFE/MAE data in chart 3.
  3. This chart graphs our average MFE/MAE/OUTCOME if we were to take the entry signal with a max hold time of x.
  4. This chart shows us our Win Rate using our SL and TP based on the entry signal in question with a max hold time of x. The yellow line represents the win rate required to break even. The red line represents the win rate required to break even after paying our spread cost. _**< \- This is the only chart that takes into account the SL and TP. The other 3 are looking at how price reacts after the entry.**_

Look at the possible entries section. It explains it there. You then manage the trade with the stop loss and target settings and stack them like I showed in the Important Notes section.  
  
It's actually extremely simple. It's 3 MAs using some of the most popular settings out there.

EU spiking fast... Might get some blood on my hands... Will cut and run around 1.1590 and wait for momentum to point back down. Then I'll be hitting it pretty hard to make up for the lost pips and milk that move down as much as possible.  
  
One of the main reasons of using the really small TP is you can often get more pips out of a range than the range its self. In a day, you can get 200 pips out of an 80 pip range sometimes. This allows you to make up a lot of pips in smaller moves, and you can just get really crazy with the large moves.

This is the stacking I am referring to in the Important Notes section. In fast markets I will stack quickly, sometimes it takes me a bit longer. But you basically build the position as you think it will go in your favor and break it down when you think you caught a bad first entry (will be about 1/10 first entries on average, keyword being on average.)

Hey Sis....I will let you chew on this type of exit (I got 32 of these design to squeeze round the clock within a given threshold)  
Making up some numbers to put some ideas across...  
Max risk per account (say) 20%  
Max open positions (say) 20  
Average risk per trade = 1%  
Entry setup = any trend following (breakout?) you like...signals should be in the direction of trend.  
Pairs=28 pairs( or all pairs for each country currency)  
Trade frequency= at least one trade every 30 minutes  
TIME IN market= 100%  
Close all before Friday NY lunch   
  
Exit= any of these...  
Close all Buys when profit is @ per trade risk  
Close all sells when profit is @per trade risk  
Close all JPY or EUR when profit is @per trade risk  
Close all opened during Tokyo when profit is @ per trade risk  
Close all opened during London when profit is @ per trade risk  
Etc etc.   
Buy retail sell in bulk or Sell retail and buy in bulk....try it please. 

Staying in my lane...

All of your trade scenarios appear to be Longs. Am I mistaken?  
Should we just reverse them for shorts?

Ah thank you for pointing this out. Yes, reverse everything for shorts. I will make an adjustment to the first post.

Hey sis.yphus,  
  
I am mainly interested how you cut losers? Which indications do you use to determine if that particular trade is worth cutting when over 90% of your trades win? Is it PA or the indicators telling you that? Since it is your strat, the exit/cutting should be defined as well.  
  
Also, the indicator that you attached with the colours basically mean red = short, blue = long together with the other MAs? If correct, the other MAs are simple or exponential?  
  
Thank you, looking forward to test this :-)

What about setting SL to BE + spread and commission and letting it run for more pips instead of closing at 4 pips? Or have different sets of TPs?

I say go for it, but make sure to book your pips when you can because the small gains add up super fast. How you manage the trades is up to you.

As for cutting losers, I will be posting some more on that soon with some more graphs for those who love data like me.  
  
As for the MA being exponential or simple, these ones are simple I believe, but it really won't make much of a difference depending on which type you use.

Expecting EU to head south after/during Draghi speech. Starting to get in some shorts looking for small scalps. If it moves quick will look for some bigger gains.

**The Anatomy of a Loser**  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2860224?d=1529499043)

  
  
So it appears that this question has already become pretty frequently asked... "How do you know when to cut a loss?"  
  
This is a tough question. How can you make sure you don't become so tied to one deal, that you continue to pour resources into it even though its most likely a loser based on the behaviors and current results of the deal?  
  
You look at the data! You need to figure out how losers behave. Just knowing how the losers act though isn't enough, you also need to know how your winners behave. This way you can make educated guesses on how your current trade is likely to develop based on its current development.  
  
So without further ado, let's look at the data!  
  
IMPORTANT NOTE:  
These are just average values for MAE/MFE. This means 50% of the time the MAEs will be LARGER than the average. One out of 2 will be larger than the average...  
\-------------------------------------------------  
Let's start by getting a general overview of how the losers and winners behave during the different hold periods after our entry.  
  
_**The Bird's Eye View:**_  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2860237?d=1529499731)

![](/attachment/image/2860239?d=1529499736)

  
  
We can see a very clear difference in behaviors of the winners and losers. If a winner is going to take a long time to be a winner (100-200+ bars), the average MAE will still stay relatively low even though you will be holding the position for so long. On the flip side, if a loser is a loser, it will happen rather quickly regardless of hold time.  
  
If you are stuck in a trade for 150 candles, and your max MAE so far though is only say 15-20 pips or below the Losers Avg MAE, it is a safe assumption to bet that this trade will be a winner.  
  
If you are stuck in a trade for 35 candles, and your max MAE is already 10-15 pips above the Losers Avg MAE, it is a safe assumption to bet that this trade is most likely a loser, because in general, if it were a winner, it would not see that high of drawdown, that early in the trade (Remember the important note though, you won't always be right). If it were a winner, on average, it wouldn't see that high of drawdown even if you had to hold for 200 more candles to get your tp.  
  
The main idea of all this being, the longer you are in a trade, and the lower your MAE is, the more likely the trade is to be a winner. With each candle that closes while your MAE remains well below the average MAE for that hold period, the probabilities of that trade being a winner slightly increase (it is extremely slight, but it is increasing). The opposite is true if your MAE continues to be above average after each candle closes, this would mean the probabilities of this trade being a loser are slightly increasing with every new candle.  
  
So we are able to draw some really good conclusions from our overview of the winners and losers. Next, let's dive down a little bit and look at these charts up close so we can come up with some general rules you guys can use to cut your losers.  
  
_**Winners & Losers - First 100 Candles After Entry**_  

Attached Image

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2860294?d=1529500708)

  
  
Again notice how the Avg MAEs very drastically between the winners and losers.  
  
On average, by 20 candles after entry, the average your MAE would have traveled is 6 pips within 20 candles if the trade is a loser. If it is a winner, this average is only 3 pips. Now, these difference are very small early on, but as we extend our hold time, they grow rapidly.  
  
On average, by 40 candles after entry, the average your MAE would have traveled is about 19 pips within 40 candles if the trade is a loser. If it is a winner, this average is only about 4 pips.  
  
On average, by 60 candles after entry, the average your MAE would have traveled is about 30 pips within 60 candles if the trade is a loser. If it is a winner, this average is only about 5 pips.  
  
_**Rules for Cutting Losers:**_  
\- Within 20 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE has reached more than 3x the average, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If the MAE has remained relatively low during this first 20 candles, chances are you in a winner.  
  
\- Within 40 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE is considerably greater than 19 pips within 40 candles, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If the MAE has remained to be less than 10-15 pips within 40 candles, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
\- Within 60 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE is at or around 30 pips within 60 candles, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If your MAE has remained around 10-15 pips or so after 60 candles, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
\- What to consider while watching the trade develop.  
\- - Imagine you were plotting the MAE line of your open trade as it develops, candle by candle. What does that line look like as it develops candle by candle? If it is developing how the avg MAE for our losing trades and continues to do so as each new candle forms, you are likely in a losing trade. If it is developing how the avg MAE for our winning trades and continues to do so as each new candle forms, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
I hope this helps everyone get a good sense of when to cut their losers and when to size into their position.

> The Anatomy of a Loser {image} So it appears that this question has already become pretty frequently asked... "How do you know when to cut a loss?" This is a tough question. How can you make sure you don't become so tied to one deal, that you continue to pour resources into it even though its most likely a loser based on the behaviors and current results of the deal? You look at the data! You need to figure out how losers behave. Just knowing how the losers act though isn't enough, you also need to know how your winners behave. This way you can...

Outstanding! Is this a custom solution you created or something available to us that we can use? A near real time solution via an indicator to run against trade history would be an awesome thing to have :-)  
  
Edit: This is the only reason why I use myFXbook

Yes, this is coming from stuff I coded in MQL4 that dumps out into a spreadsheet.

Awesome. That would be a great share. Looking forward. I won't need to hook up to TE and myFXbook and expose my account to strangers :-)  
  
May I suggest you include a filter on the comment field and/or by magicnumber. I track all my trades against "environment variabilities" so this would be a great addition to my post trade analysis...which is alsolutrly critical to the account growth. You are doing great service here bro. Keep it up!

And just to say it....I have said this several times before. I am against opening of new trades based on the status of open/floating positions. That should not be confused with post trade analysis that you are highlighting here. In fact, I value filters coming out of post trade analysis far more than filters based on Price itself. This is a very legit way to drill down and reduce your trade count and increase the razor sharpiness with the entries.  
  
This is my approach to eliminating dependency on price (for those who have read my past posts and journey). This is the best systematic appraoch to addressing things that are in my control, things that can be controlled and things that just have to be left to the markets.

Slow day... Been spending a lot of the day in DD for some orders around 1.1570-80 area.   
  
Trade looked like a loser at first as MAE went up pretty quickly but then dropped off and didn't continue how it should have it was a for sure loser.  
  
When that happens, make the DD pay you!  
  
Scrapped up 51 pips as price bounced around a 25 pip range.

Going to hold onto my entries around the 1.1570s-80s and look to get out tonight later in the Asian session.   
  
In general, I am expecting EU to have some pretty brutal down days the next coming weeks so I will be biased short.   
  
The two economies and their performance or seriously diverging, along with each countries CB and their monetary policies.  
  
That being said, watch the MAs and don't be shocked if you see me tomorrow selling more euros lol.

This is what has been my Achilles heel, having a bias whereas my signals are saying contrary and just watch price go on without me.  
  
I believe there's still much to learn from your trading style, keep it coming. 

Let it turn and find your entry.

Not sure if you are using the max 1:1 leverage per trade, but that equity curve is nice ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)

No, however you could trade this alongside the pivot, knowing 3/4 days it will strike there. Close 1/2 and shoot for pivot maybe?  
  
This system is much easier to use imo since it's not time-dependent, meaning only get a target every 24 hours.  
  
The other similarities are in both these systems you need to use MM/trade management to make it work. Like I said in the first Important Note, you can't just 100% automate this and turn a $300 chrome book into an ATM.

You can quickly make back your losses when you get back in line with the trend/flow of the market.  
  
  
Will likely open a couple more sell scalps but going to slow down for the day. EU vol is picking up like crazy, 2 20-30 pip candles today. Tempting to sell the spikes.

"4 pip tp and 36 sl!?!?!? SIS! YOU FOOL! THIS WILL NEVER WORK! DON'T YOU KNOW R:R NUMBERS ARE YOUR EDGE!?!?! I mean all the uber furus say I should never use below 1:3... and I haven't made any money following them so you know it's true! I have also never seen any data or anything like that to explain why one is better than the other or if there are any differences at all so why would you do this!!!!!!!"  
  
I knew it would happen...  
  
I could see it coming from maybe 1000, possibly 2000 miles away.  
  
Well guys, let's put this shit bed for good.  
  
_**You don't**_ _**like the R**_ _**:R**_ _**? Well quit bitching and use whatever one you want, the edge upon entry remains the same, and it will still be your MM skills that will make the most difference. Don't believe? See below:**_  
  
If you have been following my work for a long time, you may remember the first thread I ever made that talked about price traveling between pivot points without any time requirement to see how likely price is to bounce from one to another. Eventually, the data lead me to this conclusion. If you randomly enter the market, no matter what r:r you use, your win rate will be the break-even rate of that r:r configuration minus trading costs.  
  
From this, you can conclude that there are only 2 things that can really give us an advantage:  
_**1\. Having an edge UPON entry, regardless of r:r.**_  
_**2\. Identifying winners & losers so you know which trades to cut, protect, and leave on.**_  
  
  
What is the difference between these two images?  
  
**_(All images below use the 3C:200-50-10 entry)_**  
_**36 Pip SL - 4 Pip TP**_

Does the edge you have upon entering the market change?  
  
No.  
  
The only things that change are this:  
\- The size of your losses and wins.  
\- The distributions of your losses and wins.  
\- How you manage your trades  
  
_**Your edge is the same though... Because your edge upon entry is really what will determine your outcomes regardless of the r:r used (assuming you use reasonable numbers, 1000 pip take profits are a little much...). You can then amplify your edge upon entry with how you manage the trade.**_  
  
So if you don't like the R:R I am using, use whatever one you like that fits your style. I personally like to win a lot so I prefer the higher hit hates. If you don't mind taking tons of small losses for a few big winners, go ahead and flip it, go 2:1 or 1:2 or 1:0.3238843 or .832323:16 or whatever the hell you want!  
  
If you are relatively new or haven't been trading for a long time and feel extremely comfortable with the market, I think it is silly for you to use an r:r where you can expect to lose consistently more than 30% of the time. Again that won't bother everyone, but most animals in nature will stop competing, and stop playing with their peers if they lose more than 30% of the time. Most will become psychologically defeated.

Whatever r:r you use, just make sure you understand that the r:r does not provide you any advantage in terms of gaining an edge. All it does is change how you will manage your winners and losers, the average size of your winners and losers, and the distribution of your winners and losers.

I know a trader, who can make 3-5 pip at will almost.   
if he gets more great if not he is happy with what he got, he has been trading for over ten yrs and still in the game.

How can you say that the 1C-10: Price Closes Above 10 MA & Slope is Up strategy will have a chance to hit target 90% of the times? I downloaded you indicator and backtested it a bit and I barely see any profitability. Can you please explain more? thanks

See important notes...  
  
The 90% coincides with the hold time...  
  
Simply using the r:r 36:4 provies a 90% BE rate... so even with no edge you would be winning 90% of the time with that rr... With the edge and proper management you can get 93%+.

Spot on Sis.... almost but you summed it up very well. I am hating nice guys like you who are just nice in sharing their wealth and making us think...and for me, any thought process triggered is something I just cannot let go of ...so even putting good folks on ignore is not working for me lol  
  
I kept thinking about your MAE and MFE tools which is crucial. It was a bit above my coding grade so gave up on this and many other stats which I find useless. At the end of my journey, I am come to the realization that only two things matter in any (or my) strategy:  
1) Return over Max DD. If this ratio is at least 2+, I am good and it does not matter to me, what other stats look good or bad  
2) Entry Accuracy and Exit Accuracy %, one could make tremendous wealth with 70+% entry accuracy. I have said this before, any entry setup has the potential of increasing the accuracy%. It does not matter what setup or PA or TA is used...pick any and figure how how to increase the accuracy % to address the "Return" portion of #1 above. Pick any exit strategy and increase the %exit accuracy and you will address the "MaxDD" portion of #1.  
  
Both #1 and #2 must go hand in hand.... everything else can be completely ignored and irrelevant...in fact, focussing on these nonsensical stats is detrimental to our account growth imo. Having said this, any performance measure could be manipulated to look great with some creative thinking.  
Would you agree?

Lol sometimes I question why I share so much... I always just think I wish someone shared it with me as none of this stuff is that complex, or maybe I just feel that way now that I really understand it. I also like to share because most people don't actually read any of it anyways or put it into practice.   
  
I agree and disagree with you regarding stats being manipulated. Certain stats can be manipulated, but the ones that can don't pay the bills and in most cases, manipulate them will ensure you can't pay the bills.  
  
The money you pull out every week and the money you start with every week cannot be manipulated. Your absolute return cannot be manipulated.  
  
For me, these are the things that matter in any and every strategy:  
1\. The size of the spread relative to the total range between your average TP and SL (if they change each trade).  
2\. The edge of the entry and it's consistency over time.  
3\. The expected value from the entry edge combined with the risk management parameters and trading costs. Is it positive?

My manipulation, I mean if an investor wants a good profit factor or a good win/loss rate or a good average win/loss etc etc, a strategy can be developed to focus purely on those stats...some but obviously not all.  
  
I want to comment on spread and trading costs. Forget about RM, MM, SL, TP etc for a minute and only focus on entry, exit and recovery of "trading costs". If risk is trading cost, recovery of trading cost is reward, just a simply strategy of 1:1 to recover costs plus a tiny bit of profit is sufficient. I do this without any regard to spread via ecn commission broker by considering a trade to not be in profit without a trading cost multiple of more than 1. I find measuring performancec as a multiple of trading costs to be the most consistent way instead of pips or dollar amounts or even %. Of course all this requires a honest broker which is just not available to us retailers lol

And I think you are saying... There is no edge in a setup. alone....Edge results in the "_execution_ " of the setup or entry given the other parameters that affect positive expectancy

O yeah I know what you mean, you can definitely do that, but anyone worth their weight in salt when it comes looking at data would quickly realize what is happening.  
  
That is an interesting way to look at it. One could argue that at any time, their true risk is actually just the trading cost so it would make sense to use it as a base risk measure. Like you said though, brokers for retail are brutal to work with.

Basically, if you mean setup just being the r:r you choose.  
  
Edge is gained upon entry, and then you can increase it or decrease it with good and bad money management

Perhaps a little more on edge since you are a "facts and data" guy like me.  
  
You say edge is in the entry.  
I say, there is no edge in the entry "setup" (of price over time)... either on a two-dimensional chart or price vs time data stream. By this I mean, I am a subscriber of "Efficient Market Hypothesis". whatever edge that might exists in the price feed is only limited to it's discovery with no long term consistent positive expectancy derived from it.  
  
What I am saying is... edge results in the _application_ of a setup with a stated statistical probability. It's odds can be increased based on devising a strategy and executing that strategy using whatever RM, MM parameters of choice  
What I am saying is.... even if you don't know or have an edge in entry, positive expectancy can be derived with a robust strategy... and here, I am not referring to random entries.  
What I am also saying is.... such a robust strategy will only work fabulously during fat/heavy tailed distributions which is where most money is made. If you agree with this point then it also means, we MUST gain as much as, as fast as we can, during favorable market conditions.... and "slow" the loses when market is just churning and going nowhere. I think "trade frequency" is a very important factor in performance measurement which many ignore imo.

When I say edge I mean the probability of the outcome being more than it should be if it were random. So with the 4 pip tp and 36 sl, my edge is my win rate percentage based on the BE percentage of the r:r setup.  
  
So if I win 93.5% of the time and my spread cost is 2%, I have a 1.5% edge.  
  
Regarding EHM, the market is efficient in only one dimension if that makes sense. mzvega has some really good posts on this.  
  
In regards to gaining an edge purely for a risk model, I know it works with certain parameters, but they are usually unattainable and if they are, the return is extremely small relative to the equity, like microscopic. This is just in my experience though, if someone wants to point me to a paper showing the opposite to be true, I would love it. Unfortunately, I have never met a soul who could point me to that paper or study.   
  
I also have not been clever enough to come up with my own models that would do something like that. I saw a Monty Hall model one time on here that looked pretty interesting but never figured out what exactly was going on.

Thanks for all your responses. I believe we are aligned. I will only believe in someone having an "edge" if they can show solid consistent performance of 2-3+ yrs. There are simply not that many out there in the retail spot FX space who can make this claim and those who really are (couple I know of) are based on the trader themselves and not the specific strategy they use. That is what makes me a non-believer of "price action". I have done immense studies on stop placements and margin calls and account behaviour when position size is increased or when you take bigger risk or when you use small TP orders or when you try to trap the market or follow the market etc etc and I simply could not find any so called consistency in "edge performance". Every attempt simply resulted in "makret is favorable now and about" and "decay is just around the corner". Decay seems to be the inevitable factor consistent in all my findings. That coupled with all the manipulation techniques I knew of and ones that our friend FractalFreak is showing simply makes me re-affirm the fact why so many lose in the retail spot FX space.   
There is tremendous amount of intelligence to be found here and still have yet to find success also reiterates my conclusion that retail fx trading is just a waste of time. We have to move towards centralized markets and play in the real supply/demand market.  
  
Would you agree with my findings and conclusion? I know this is heavy and loaded :-)

Yes, this is the case, and unfortunately, it's true for all things in life. 99.9% of all species go extinct. BUT life is still abundant and all around us. Everywhere.

I wouldn't say its a waste of time, maybe if you don't learn anything. What do you mean centralized markets? Why not trade futures on CME?

Yes ...futures is what I mean i.e. regulated/centralized.  
  
Agree...knowledge is never a waste but at the end, we are in this to make money...not just here and there but consistently for the long run :-)

Money is definitely the motive.  
  
Just exploring this idea of centralization, do you really think that if you move to the futures market and trade EU mini contracts, the behavior of price would be any different than what you see at the spot broker? Would it be so significantly different that you could make money on one chart but not the other?

Thanks. I am too tired but I am glad you directed me to that extracted post. I had not read it and the similarities of my journey with what CP wrote years ago makes me feel a little bit better :-)

No difference in relation to just the price feed but I can gaurantee this with 1000% certainly. A fully automated strategy on EU mini futures will yield different outcome compared to trading Eurusd in MT4 with a spot FX broker (especially with a non-US broker) and/or vice versa.  
  
**I will quit trading for good if anyone proves me wrong**!  
  
**Edit:** duration of strategy comparison must be at least 3 yrs

actually, the real and the NOW point we will always have only 50% probability the price either higher or down. and all zone is killing zone.   
look forward first and we will only have a blank (50%:50% probability up or down), after that look to the past. by this approach we can exploit the past history as an edge.  
but if we first look to the past to search an edge, we will forgotten that the fact ahead we only have 50:50 probability in every tick, in every minute NOW.  
thats why for me I do not predict I just only ride.  
and yes agree this forex is killing zone, the pure market battlefield. 

we don't predict, we only ride

It's interesting idea. I am testing this now. I have never done analysis with MFE/MAE.  
Quick test results showed me, that when you are cutting lossers, your lossers are smaller in pips. But you are cutting your winners too, some winners are now loosers, so you'll have less winners and at the end the result is the same.  
My entry is H1 open price, always buy(or sell), probability 50:50, ther is no edge in entry.  
I have other ideas to test with this type analysis, but I think the result will be the same, if there is no edge in entry.

Hi!  
  
Thanks for sharing the interesting concept and point of view!  
Sorry for the very noob question. Are you opening trade only by candle crossing the MA-s or looking a new trade for every (of course not _every)_ candle closing above the MA?  
  
With regards,

Hi VEEFX,  
  
I have traded futures for many years, but the fact that it is a centralized market does not prevent manipulations.  
  
To give you an example, the dark pool can use hidden orders, and some volumes appear only 24 hours later on board of the CME.  
  
Even if your "friend" FractalFreak have reason on many points, all the forex movement is not only manipulations, just as for the future.  
  
Banks need to do a lot of trading for their big customers, for example changing 400 billion dolar into YEN for an export company.  
They go through the forex, and have a range of possibilities for the bank to get the best price for this type of transaction.  
  
There is certainly a lot of manipulation, but it is not 100% always the case ...  
  
By the way, I trade the futures market with my own algorithm (almost like an HFT) and I don't care of manipulation ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) most of the time, not always ^^

Thanks GregV. Perhaps we are diverting from the topic on hand but it is related to the small TP proposed by Sis. Have you tried running your hft algo in spot FX to experience any difference in outcome? My strategy is also relying on trade frequency and as with any algo, we rely on connectivity with the broker's platform. Please read [here](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11182413#post11182413) the games and tools/plugins available to all retail brokers and tell me if these are available to futures brokers also? I am not referring to price or volume or order flow manipulations. I can handle all those with no issues. They can mess with one trade but not all 50-60 of my trades because they know i got 7 gorillas (entry/exit/profit/loss/drawdown/margin/exposure functions) tracking all their sneaky moves lol  
  
And FFreak is NOT my buddy...he is on my ignore list :-)  
  
Edit: also, which instrument is your algo trading in the futures market? Just curious

You're welcome.  
Regarding your first question, the differences are of course present. I do not want to list in detail the differences here because this is not the subject of the thread ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
And I do not want to bother those who follow the strategy presented or disrespect the OP.  
  
Some have asked me to open my own thread about futures and my algorithms, but given the way things are going on here, and given the behavior of some, I think there is very little chance I want to do it ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
There are very few curious members who give themselves the means to do their own research. You are part of these VEEFX members, but how much more  
are able to simply understand that one has to go beyond what one believes to start being profitable in trading? can be 3 or 4 other members? on thousands ...  
  
Trying to guide people in this forum would be a waste of time, because either they do not have the necessary background or the necessary means, or they like things that are done and are lazy, or they only like to criticize and unburden their frustration exactly as for the FractalFreak thread.

Hope everyone has a good weekend. Remember, when you get on a real hot streak, you need to curb your enthusiasm or else you will burn yourself.

Whenever I want to refresh my trading mind - such as it exists - I try to get my head around some of the fascinating stats you present on your threads : thank-you ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1).  
  
This thread is interesting me as after studying my MFE stats, I am - not for the first time - considering greatly reducing my initial targets. A work very much in progress, leading to my response to your point 2 above. Surely it is the edge of the **exit** and it's consistency over time that is most significant ? Btw, I did read Post #55.  
  
You have a great weekend.

**More Data For Better Decision Making**  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2866126?d=1529894635)

  
(If only she knew it was recently shaken)  
  
So we broke down the [Anatomy of Hillary Clinton](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11185595#post11185595), which was downright dirty. It showed us how our winning and losing trades should behave over time from our entry point, giving us a good sense of when to cut and when to let it run or even size in.  
  
This is great information that can guide us after we enter the market, but I still see many asking questions on WHEN to enter the market as the general entry rules are very broad. At least one of the 7 entry signals is valid on nearly every single candle close, and it's usually more than one ("What the f*** is this guy thinking posting 7 f***ing entry conditions that are nearly always met? This ain't push button enough for me! Making a living must be easier than picking my nose!").  
  
Well, folks, I won't tell you how to make trading easier than picking your nose, but I will go into how we can use data to make better decisions for determining **_**when**_** to enter a trade.  
  
Not only are these MAs and their slopes great for giving us entry signals that have an edge, but they also slice the market into cycles for us. Yipee! A bear cycle begins when price opens above the ma and closes below, and it ends when the opposite occurs, which then begins a bull cycle.  
  
By looking at how price cycles from one side of the MA to the other, we can get an idea of how far a cycle is likely to travel and how long a cycle is likely to last. It shouldn't take a genius to figure out that you want to get in on the cycle as early as possible so you still have room for your price target to be met and also time for it to get there.** If a cycle lasts 10 bars, you probably don't want to enter on the 9th bar if it takes 6 bars on average for your target to be reached.**  
  
So let's check out how price cycles around our 3 different MAs:  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2866115?d=1529893650)

  
  
_**How to Read Data:**_  
If price crosses the 10 MA, it will travel <=13 pips 75% of the time and <=7 pips 50% of the time. Once price travels 7 pips, it now has a 50% chance of traveling 6 more pips to 13 pips above the start of the of the cycle.  
  
If price crosses the 10 MA, the cycle will last <=8 candles 75% of the time and <=3 candles 50% of the time. Once the cycle has lasted 3 candles, there is a 50% chance it will last 5 more, totaling 8 candles.  
  
If price crosses the 50 MA, it will travel <=19 pips 75% of the time and <=8 pips 50% of the time. Once price travels 8 pips, it now has a 50% chance of traveling 11 more pips to 19 pips above the start of the of the cycle.  
  
If price crosses the 50 MA, the cycle will last <=15 candles 75% of the time and <=4 candles 50% of the time. Once the cycle has lasted 4 candles, there is a 50% chance it will last 11 more, totaling 15 candles.  
  
If price crosses the 200 MA, it will travel <=30 pips 75% of the time and <=10 pips 50% of the time. Once price travels 10 pips, it now has a 50% chance of traveling 20 more pips to 30 pips above the start of the of the cycle.  
  
If price crosses the 200 MA, the cycle will last <=20 candles 75% of the time and <=4 candles 50% of the time. Once the cycle has lasted 4 candles, there is a 50% chance it will last 16 more, totaling 20 candles.  
  
_**Rules for When to Trade:**_  
\- If the distance to your TP is larger than what the cycle has a 50% chance of traveling, don't enter the trade.  
\- If the distance to your TP is smaller than what the cycle has a 50% chance of traveling BUT you are not giving the trade enough candles to reach that distance (Cycle is more likely to end soon rather than continue), don't enter the trade or close the trade if it has already been on as the cycle is more likely to end soon rather than continue.  
  
That's all folks! I hope this helps, but I am sure it won't.

It seems that there is edge here, but there isn't. I can show you, where equilibrium occurs and at the end it is 50:50. If price doesn't travel 20 more pips to 30p above the start of cycle, then price has to start a new cycle. Imagine that previous cycle was a bull. And a new bear cycle starts(bull cycle ends) when price closes below MA.("A bear cycle begins when price opens above the ma and closes below, and it ends when the opposite occurs, which then begins a bull cycle."). So we don't know, where this candle closes: 1 pip/10 pip/50 pip below MA, and there efficiency occurs: we can win sure 20p on average, and loss will be on average 20p too, when you take in to account where candle closes.  
Rules for when to trade, I don't get well, because it seems more, when not to trade.  
Sorry if I sound too negative, but I have done a lot of stats on zigzags, and it is what it is. Whatever action you'll take, there will always be an equal opposite reaction.

Those pip distances measure from the CLOSE of the first candle in the cycle, to the max MFE, not the MA to the max MFE.

Yes, I understood that.  
"If price crosses the 200 MA, it will travel <=30 pips 75% of the time and <=10 pips 50% of the time. Once price travels 10 pips, it now has a 50% chance of traveling 20 more pips to 30 pips above the start of the of the cycle."  
What I wanted to say: There is 50%, that you'll get 20 pips. But on the other hand, if the price don't go 20p more(it will be 50% of time), and you'll wait for new cycle start, you won't lose 10p, you'll always lose >=10p and on average it'll be -20pips.

That's why you stuck many positions and not one,quess where...  
That's why you have also this to limit the stop loss   
_**Rules for Cutting Losers:**_  
\- Within 20 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE has reached more than 3x the average, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If the MAE has remained relatively low during this first 20 candles, chances are you in a winner.  
  
\- Within 40 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE is considerably greater than 19 pips within 40 candles, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If the MAE has remained to be less than 10-15 pips within 40 candles, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
\- Within 60 candles of entry:  
\- - If your MAE is at or around 30 pips within 60 candles, you are likely in a losing trade.  
\- - If your MAE has remained around 10-15 pips or so after 60 candles, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
\- What to consider while watching the trade develop.  
\- - Imagine you were plotting the MAE line of your open trade as it develops, candle by candle. What does that line look like as it develops candle by candle? If it is developing how the avg MAE for our losing trades and continues to do so as each new candle forms, you are likely in a losing trade. If it is developing how the avg MAE for our winning trades and continues to do so as each new candle forms, you are likely in a winning trade.  
  
I hope this helps everyone get a good sense of when to cut their losers and when to size into their position.

Fantastic explaination bro. Good Job. When to cut losses is the most difficult thing to do imo. Frankly, I have only focussed on %entry accuracy and %exit accuracy for my entries and exits. This opens a whole new realm of possibilities in the field of AI and ML techniques. Am I wrong in saying that focussing on MAE is not necessary if I have over 80% exit accuracy stats across the spectrum of my trade history?  
  
Also, majority of my "instantaneous losers" i.e. positions that reverse immediate (without a minute or two) upon entry, also recover over the course of the week with < 5% of losing trades left on Friday for me to decide whether to fold or hold. This approach works fine as most of my breakout trades could be bounce trades and vice versa. Those that breakout, kaboom! Those that don't break, I end up with "oh shit" thought which most likely addresses itself during the remainder of the week. Not sure if MAE analysis will help me with such a strategy but it is always worthwhile to investigate and rule out. 

Staying in my lane...

That's not true. If it exactly looks like the MAE, then you have a 50/50 chance. That's the reason why Sis.yphus put a factor before it.

Hi.  
  
First of all, thx for the simple and great system, working great for me! I suspect if I had more time, I would make even more pips ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1)  
  
I have one question regarding TP and SL. I have an trade manager EA, which sets TP and SL auto. The way I use it, is that I sell 50% of my lot at 4 pips and the rest is at a trailing stop of 2 pips. This way I get a good chance of making even more pips. Downside is, if it hits 4 pips and retrace, I will only gain 2 pips instead of 4 pips.  
  
However my "tests" shows that I more than often get quite a good running of my position and due to my reduced screentime, I will get even more pips than usually.  
  
Just my two cents.

My 2 cents...  
  
_**VeeFX: Define Trading & Investment Goal**_  
Define your goals and objectives as part of your trading plan. Things like Why the hell am I trading? What % of growth and income returns is desirable, max drawdown, per position %risk, Total % equity risk, SL, TP, trade frequency, sessions, pairs, exposure, rate and frequency of deposits, withdrawals, taxes, expenses, etc etc based on the overall financial goals across all asset class.  
  
Use a top-down approach first and then devise a FX trading strategy to fit the needs for your chosen portfolio allocation. One should not pick a strategy first then make it work and then tweak it to achieve your goals. That is a too narrowly focussed. You need to think big and make the necessary steps to accommodate growth of you as a investor, as a trader, as an analyst and trading capital.

Yep...remember I am a neutral guy with no permanent home on the Factory. I am like living on "No Man's Land" until I reach "Land's End".  
  
Speaking of Land's End, I have travelled many Lands End locations around the world. It is on my bucket list to visit each and every one of them (except the ones way up North and South...I am too old to freeze my b**ls LOL)  
It is something so magical, refreshing and spiritual to visit such remote locations. I have already chosen my destination on where and how to depart :-)

**Equity Progression**  
  
You ever wonder what your account growth would look like if you got your hands on a winning system? I bet you imagine it going straight up as it smoothly sails you into the lap of luxury... I am almost positive you don't imagine it would look how it really does.  
  
Below is how your equity would progress using a really strong system over x amount of trades. This simulation uses a system that risks 5 units for 7 units with a 50/50 strike rate and a spread of 0.5 pips.

Too few people would have.  
  
Please indulge me.  
  
I think the challenge is how many of those draw downs actually hit SL? You really have to know that with 1000 consecutive losses on a 1:1 leverage your equity can survive to fight another 500 trades of 36 pips SL. 

Let it turn and find your entry.

**How I tested Cutting losers short.**  
My entry is always buy on new H1 open candle. TP = 5p(Added 1p spread, so with spread 4p), SL = -35p(with spread -36p). Why entry H1 open and not MA's? Because it is simpler to code, and the same probability of entry: 50:50 , there is nothing magical about MA's.  
So if I open trades with Tp and SL, and don't cut losers, wait for TP or SL, the stats are :  
Trades:84600;  
Wins:74828;  
Losers:9772;  
Win%: 88.45%;  
Average pips per trade = -0.62p.  
So after 10 minutes of candle open I got MAE stats(trades which lasts more than 10 minutes):  
MAE winners: 5.1p;  
MAE losers: 9.1p.  
So, lets try to cut losers if within 10 minutes trade's MAE gets to >=20p(tried with 10p, 30p - result the same):  
Trades:84600;  
Wins:68723;  
Losers:15877;  
Win%: 81.23%;  
Average pips per trade = -0.67p;  
Average win pips: 4p;  
Average loser pips: -20.86p.  
As you can see, if you cut losers, you cut your winners too, and the result is the same, when you look at average pips per trade.  
Of course, I could do it more complicated: look for MAE's after each minute, each 10 minutes. But some positive results should be seen from this simple analysis.  
So maybe am I doing something wrong? Has someone else tried something similar?

You literally "test" the strategy using the wrong time frame, wrong opening conditions, scrapped all the tools altogether and their related cycles, and tried to 100% automate it despite me saying multiple times it wouldn't work...

I didn't like the entry you were using, so I used my entry. Because, it's the same 50:50 result at the end, if I use MA's or open price.

I didn't want to test all your system. All I wanted to test, how much your edge increases managing your winners/losers in your written aproach. I think, it should be seen some micro edge no matter the entry you are using.  
I am not trolling, sorry, if I understood wrong.

The r:r you choose does really depend on your psyche. For me, doing the reverse is much harder.  
  
Combine the cycle data with the MAE/MFE data and you should have a really clear picture of which sections of the market you should be participating in.

**Probability of Profit in a Series**

In this last post, we looked at how our equity curve is likely to progress using a pretty good system. That gave us a good idea of what to expect, but it still leaves the question, "how many trades do I need to take in order to expect to be profitable?"  
  
And that is a fine question to ask. The answer to that question will give you a lot of insight in terms of what conditions need to be present for you to consistently make money within a fixed period of time. As I have mentioned in other posts, this is how large trading desks like Goldman Sachs will [make money 9 days out of 10, for years.](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=10939052#post10939052) This will also give a good way to benchmark your system and make sure it is actually performing how it should be.  
  
Let's get into some numbers. I wrote a script that will do 100,000 simulations of a trading series lasting x amount of trades. It then looks at each of them to determine the probability of being in the money at the end of that series. This uses the same system in the last post. 50% Win Rate, 5 Pip SL, 7 Pip TP, and 0.5 Pip Spread.  
  
_**WIN RATE: 50% | SL: 5 | TP: 7 | SPREAD: 0.5**_  
_**

**_  
  
Pretty amazing stuff. In any series of 10 trades, you only have a 61% chance of making money. In any series of 100 trades, you only have an 81% chance of making money. **That means it would be totally normal to have a series of 100 trades where you end up losing money as a whole, out of every 500 trades you take. If 5 people pick this system up and each does 100 trades. One of them will lose money, and that will be perfectly normal from a statistical standpoint.**  
  
In order to be 95% confident you will make money in a specific amount of time, you need to be able to have 400 independent occurrences.**Trading desks have so many traders so their net number of occurrences across the desk can easily be well over 500 trades. Same fore HFT algos scalping nano ticks. They don't make money every day because they cheat. They make money every day because they understand numbers.**  
  
_**WIN RATE: 93.5% | SL: 36 | TP: 4 | SPREAD: 0.5**_  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2871467?d=1530114158)

  
Notice how the number differ from the other system, but not drastically or in some huge way. In some series lengths, this system is more likely to turn a profit, and in other series, the other system is more likely to see a profit. **Both systems need 400 independent occurrences to have 95% confidence that you will see a profit at the end of the series.**  
  
**Think about this: If we had 100 traders pick up the first system and 100 traders pick up the second system and each trade 400 trades. 5 traders from each group will still lose money after 400 trades with the winning systems, and that will be statistically normal.**

Hi Sis.yphus,  
  
Thanks for putting this information together - it does give interesting insights into the probability of profitable trades given the various scenarios. I must say, my initial trading session has yielded great results as you already know, so I am looking to refine my routine a little bit (what times to trade, how many trades per day etc) to put together a complete trading system that suits my lifestyle.  
  
One question I had was whether you have the raw data that you used to put together the graphs on post #1. The data on the graphs look similar across all entry scenarios, and is hard to differentiate between the various entry methods. I would like to know how much better (or worse) the various methods are based on their entry criteria (so for instance, I am seeking data like _"entering when price has closed below 200,50 and 10 MA and sloping down has a 0.5% better chance than when price has closed below 200 and 50 MA to result on a profitable trade"_).  
  
Cheers

You are a rock star man. I have had so many discussions and arguments over this topic when folks would just advocate "trade higher timeframe", "have patience", "market is going to be around tomorrow", "be picky about trades" etc etc. Folks just don't get trading is all about numbers and not about reading price setups or analyzing entries or waiting for days/weeks for the right entry and big RR. I have used a similar approach with my automation as well..but without using hard stops for obvious reasons. I just rely on (time) frequency of profit taking to exceed the frequency of loss taking via active and decisive management of my own "order book" i.e available margin just like market makers are required to actively manage their book size. Same concept of large numbers are 'necessary' for casinos and bucket shops to maintain their contineous flow of tiny profits. There is a reason why there are 10000's of slot machines. There is a reason why retail brokers need 1000s of retail tiny accounts :-

Can I ask a (no doubt daft) question?  
  
Why are you having to hold trades so long? For instance, nearly two hours to make +1.1 pips on UJ.  
  
I am honestly not trying to be cheeky or wind you up but when I run this (and other scalping of the same ilk), I am in and out in between one and five seconds on a good day.  
  
Today, while sitting waiting for an eye exam appointment, I took four trades on my phone:  
  
GU 1' 26" (One minute Twenty-Six seconds)  
GU 9" (Nine seconds)  
GU 25" (Twenty-Five seconds)  
DAX 22" (Twenty-Two seconds)  
  
If I am missing something blatantly obvious or stepping out of line, feel free to slap me about the head.

I bet you imagine it going straight up as it smoothly sails you into the lap of luxury... I am almost positive you don't imagine it would look how it really does. Below is how your equity would progress using a really strong system over x amount of trades. This simulation uses a system that risks 5 units for 7 units with a 50/50 strike rate and a spread of 0.5 pips. 10 Trades: {image} How many would keep trading after these 10 trades?...

Sometimes lol It is pretty hard for me not to look at anything and everything from a numbers perspective. Maybe it's my way of feeling a sense of control in an uncontrollable world.

Yes, very good point. I find that I am getting stuck in some trades that go against me initially, however they never go more than 10 pips against me so essentially I am holding until it hits my TP.  
  
Based on other stats that Sis.yphus has shown us, as long as the trade does not go to 15 pips against me, it is most likely going to turn into a winning trade. I have a hard stop loss of 36 per post #1 for if I am away from the desk, but I will cut trades manually if they go 15 pips against me.  
  
I should look at refining my entries - maybe when candles pull back to 10 MA after crossing it...maybe something like this...

This is why I like looking at numbers - provides actionable observations and insights to improve trading! I will give it a shot and see how I go - currently my updated entry criteria will be as below;  
  
**Long**

  1. Price closed above 10, 50 and 200 MA
  2. All three MAs are sloping up
  3. On the 3rd or 4th down cycle candle where the candle retraces back to the 10 MA, I will enter long.

  
**Short**

  1. Price closed below 10, 50 and 200 MA
  2. All three MAs sloping down
  3. On the 3rd or 4th up cycle candle where the candle retraces back to the 10 MA, I will enter short.

Sorry if this has been asked before, but how do you determine when to adjust your take profit from 4 pips?

That is completely up to you - the only thing it changes is the amount you win and lose each time.  
ou can use only 4 pips TP (as I have been doing).  
  
You can use a mix of 4 pips and other higher TP as per [post #1](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=780088)

Or you can even use your own mix of TP/SL as shown in [post #153](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11190195#post11190195)

Ah yes! You have pre-empted my reply!  
  
Elsewhere, I ''trade lines''. This in itself has no bearing here, other than there is a method of trading pivots for instance, which has you wait for a break and close over a level, then wait for a retest and fail to close back over the other side. The entry then comes as you open a new bar below the level.  
  
This is in effect what I was going to suggest you look for in relation to refining your entries - and is what you yourself have suggested is a possible solution. Cool.  
  
My initial concern was that when scalping, we are looking for momentum to get us in and out of a trade very quickly and avoid the very situation you are finding. To me, this suggested that perhaps you were not maximising your trade entry time (in too early before in an established trend / move gives you our momentum).

Hello,  
  
I understand the probablilities and 4 pips most every trade with 10 or even 50 ma is fine but i am sure that it can be done more better with the 200 ma :

Limprobable,  
  
While this may be true, my key takeaway is this:  
  
Sis.yphus and VEEFX- these guys deal with hard numbers. If something can't be proven with hard facts, then that aspect is not part of their menu.  
  
More importantly, i feel what Sis.yphus has conveyed is the ongoing conviction one should have in one's strategy-same confidence when executing the 3rd trade as well as the 1000th trade. These figures fit into that message.  
  
While in your example, once in a while we could have a home runner, but this home runner may not be consistently predictable. Also, one of the posts Sis.yphus has mentioned that he prefers high winning rate system because anything over 35% losing rate impacts the psychology...  
  
this is just my 2 cents...  
  
Thanks

Guys you have the stats on how much pips and candles last the 200 cycle. With this data and rest you can build and tweak a strategy how you see appropriate.  
  
Just my two cents.

You can adjust the differents tp according to the probabilities.  
You can adjust the number of entries and of course dont take every signals.

As I understand it, "stacking" is about multiple entries on different MAs, so different prices. I speak of several entries at the same price on one MA (200).  
  
But maybe I do not understand because of the language. If so, I am sorry and will delete my messages.

You can stack into the same position, or stack into a new one based on a different ma and different cycle. The stacking is mainly done to increase your edge. I am going to do a post outlining what I mean by this and how MM and boost your edge once it's there. The key is, you need your edge to be there though.

MY two cents.... one must not look at abstract stats (like look at x number of candles to determine trade performance etc and then tweak the strategy to optimize it). If you do that, there is simply no connection with a "static" past candles versus a living and breathing organic environment when you open the darn trade. One must look at the "environmental" parameters that have the potential of impacting your trade outcome and only then look at your trade history to conduct post-trade analysis of hard data that is generated from your own strategy. This sh*it is important. We all tend to focus too much on price. There is a LOT that happens outside of price.  
  
I posted [this ](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11216980#post11216980)for a specific reason to come to this thread and demonstrate how important it is to do your own trade analysis. This thread is giving me further pointers to look into my losers and how to cut my losers BEFORE friday close. I will admit, I don't fully grasp the power of MAE and MFE analysis as I only focus on entry and exit % accuracy. I also feel these have to be done in near-real time as trade stats are being developed to adjust in real time.... the power of turning what SIS is sharing into ML/AI is TREMENDOUS !!! All the stuff I have read on FF regarding ML/NeuralNetworks are shit compared to just doing this analysis in real time. I just need a good coder to get this all automated as my skills are a bit limited to what I can do :-

The meat is really in the EXITS...even without any edge in price setup with entries.

Do not focus on profits - focus on improving your trading.

It takes a strong personality to realise that something isn't right for them and to walk away. No shame in that.  
  
Look for something that depends on - for instance - a set pattern at a set time of day. Something repeatable. Begin with a method like that until you find your sea legs.  
  
Perhaps **3 Little Pigs** would suit. (I am not one for posting links - just pop it in a search engine and go from there).

Hi Sisyphus,  
  
what is the highest drawdown you had using this system? I assume that could be high. If not you wouldn't give up leverage.  
Can you deal with 3 SL in the row? Sooner or later it will happen. You would need 27 TP in the row to recover it (not incuding fees).

1:1 leverage per order is about 0.3% risk for each order that takes a 36 pip loss. So 3 full stop losses in a row is 1%. If you stack properly, you can make up the lost pips on the next 2-3 moves easy.  
  
The fluctuations are supposed to be small so you can trade often, because it's the CLT and Law of Large Numbers playing out over 1000s of trades that is actually going to make the difference, not the result of any one trade.

Is there any reason why you use  
  
TF 5M and MAs with periods 200, 50, 10  
  
instead of  
  
TF 1M and MAs with periods 1000, 250, 50?

I've found 200/50/10 to be great for the 5 minute chart - maybe your suggestions of 1000/250/50 could be good for other time settings.  
  
Yesterday's trades - still need to work on those entries to get in and out quickly. I think I will look at trading first two hours of London only and maybe first hour of NY open. Other times I find prices just moving sideways and not doing much.

Can you provide some statistics?  
How many trades are you keeping open in one time? There is a consolitated risk trough pairs, currencies and open positions.  
What is the number of trades per week and what pairs are you trading?  
With such low leverage and TP you need to make 1000 trades per month to get some perfomance..

There is nothing special in the periods of the MA. The point was to use the most popular settings, but instead we use them in a scientific way based on data. The cycle numbers will look similar for any periods remotely close to the ones mentioned in the first post.

As I mentioned in my last post, that is literally the point of trading so small, so we can trade extremely often. This is extremely important if you understand the Probability of Profit in A Series post I put up.  
  
With this system, every 400 trades you place in a series, 5% of the time, you will be in the red after those 400 trades... This is because of the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.  
  
In order to really see the edge play out you need to make 1000s of trades. Ideally if you could place 30 trades a day, or 150 a week, you have an 89% chance of ending the week in the money.  
  
If you place 30 trades a week, one out of every 10 week trading periods you participate in, you will lose money after the 10 weeks, and that is _**statistically normal.**_  
  
**_If you place 3 trades a week, you can trade for the entire year with a winning system, and 1 out of every 10 years you will lose money on the year. The big advantage HFTs have is they can do what most traders do in 2-5 years, in 1 day. So their statically normal losing periods only last hours relative to the amount of trades they make a day, instead of a year relative to the amount of trades another guy makes in a decade._**

Hi Sis!  
Thank you for the answer! I really appreciate what are you doing here!  
How many simultaneous trades is allowed to have?   
One open trade for one pair?  
Is it OK to have trades open in same time for UJ, GJ, EJ (risk for JPY is tripled)?  
What pairs are suggested to trade, all 28?

I would only trade one pair at any given time. either EU or UJ since they will have the lowest [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"). How much you stack is up to you.

With win rate 95% and 4:36 RR you can risk up to 50% per position by the Kelly criterion.

Hey Sis,  
  
I would love to read your perspective on why you are against automation (or think automation would yield in different results...assuming you meant poor performance). Doesn't have to be specific to this strategy.  
  
Looking at your background, almost anything manual can be algorithmically automated. I like automated because of the consistancy in application of an approach without any emotions so just curious if there is anything else more to it.

I have waved back and forth on this issue as my knowledge and experience in trading has grown. I agree with you regarding the emotional aspect and what you mentioned in regards to consistent application of the system.  
  
As I first started getting into the statistics/data a few years ago I was 100% gunho on the fully automatic strategy that you turn on and go sit at the beach for the rest of the year. Now I am still very much for automation, and breaking down a system to the point it could be automated by completely understanding the 100%-mechanical entries and exits as this gives you a really good idea of how price behaves within certain parameters, I just think you can benefit from having a layer of discretion on top of it.   
  
I think you can have great success with a fully automatic strategy, however, I believe truly exceptional trading has a degree of discretion associated with it.  
  
The algorithms/automated trading are great for most day-to-day activity in the markets where most of the moves are typical noise of the market. However there are occasions where you will know you need to get out of a trade before your algo does, allowing you to cut some costs, and there are times where you will know to size up using house money to catch a crazy wave and milk it for all it's worth.  
  
That is just my general opinion on the issue.

Something I have talked a lot about on this thread is how the risk/money management is a huge aspect of really taking the most advantage of this system, and any system for that matter. I have been able to gather that many are thinking: How this is true? How can it really make that much of a difference? This guy is full of shit!  
  
This post will be short because the point is rather easy to make. In order to solve this mystery, every one will need to go and buy a magic conch from Amazon, and wait for further instruction upon the arrival of your conch...  
  
Once your conch arrives, come back to this thread and check out the data below.  
  
**In this post we are going to use a 1:1 risk:reward ratio and a edge over the spread that equates to 0.1% - very tiny! Not as bigly as we'd like to see. But it'll do!**  
  
Without management, just taking the trades as they come, what do you think the probability is that we will see a profit after a series of 100 trades?  
  
**If you guessed around 50%, you are pretty close, it's actually only 46.759%.**  
  
So that means with this system, we can expect to lose money every 100 trades, more than half the time. That sounds like a nightmare to trade, I know.  
  
**Now let's see what a little bit of management can do for us in this scenario. I am not going to go into the details on how the simulation is managing the trades, it's nothing fancy though, essentially stacking in one form or another.**  
  
So how much of a boost do you think we will see? 5%? 10%? 20%? I know some of you greedy bastards reading this are looking for 30%+.  
  
**Welllllllll if you guessed 98.78% you are correct!**  
  
That's right. With a proper management strategy, you can boost your probability of profit in a series of 100 trades from 46.759% to 98.78%! Pretty flipping cool if you ask me!  
  
So is trade management important? Hell yeah it is. It's so important that it can make the tiniest edge ever very profitable.

Wouldn't that number be more close to 50.05 %? 0.1 % advantage would mean to have a probability of winning in 50 % + 0.1/2% = 50.05 %. Now you're just sampling from the population and thus (on average) the expectation for samples should be equal the mean of the population.

Couple people DM me on discord asking about entries. Sorry for my poor drawing skills, but here is an example;  
  
1\. 200MA down  
2\. 50MA down  
3\. 10 MA down  
  
Now wait for a small pullback to the 10MA, and enter. Follow post #1 - TP 4 pips, manually close at 15pips and put in SL for 36 pips in case of emergency (internet cut or what not).

Thanks. I would agree with having some discretion with exits or around trade management but prefer entries to be 100% automated (in a deceptive way that is to make it harder for anyone to figure out). I think it is necessary to have a uniform setup "framework" in order to consistently apply trading stats analysis for future trades... I hate moving parts, I hate unknowns, I hate thinks that I haven't thought about or accounted for. With my discretionary trading, I never bothered with trading stats analysis in detail because how can one statistically measure our own actions ? It just did not make sense (besides, looking back, one of my main weakness was with execution... no matter how hard I tried, I just could not work and think like a robot!). Now, with my automation, I do "allow" discretionary actions but only within the context of my automation.

Good post. Do you think an edge-less (i.e. 50:50 win/loss negative-sum system before spreads) could be converted into a profitable with proper trade or risk or money management? In my findings also, most presumably profitable systems I tested (systematically) resulted in a 48%-52% range leading me to believe the following:

  1. For every profitable trade, there is almost always going to be a losing trade
  2. For every stop loss hit, there is also always going to be a corresponding take profit
  3. For every statistically proven profitable entry, there is almost always going to be a losing exit (and vice versa)
  4. For every successful bounce or breakout or fakeout or ___________, there is a unsuccessful/failed bounce or breakout or fakeout or ________.

I am not being a debbie downer but this is what I was seeing over a significant large data set which really made me focus more on volatility-induced fat tails when real profits are made. Anyways, I feel I am repeating what I have said before in my posts.  
  
Keep the gems coming bro. You are doing a great service in breaking down the complexities for most of us to understand.

How many retests will you take before you like to say a larger pullback to the 50 or 200ma?

Usually the best entry is when price has moved away from the 10 MA, then pulled back 2-3 candles. Those are the best entries.  
  
If it goes back to 50 or 200 MA, I would cut the trade as less likely to turn out the be a winner.  
  
For example, yellow circle designates what would be deemed as a good entry area to go short.

Hi Ivanyo. Your chart example above (while good) gives a clue as to why you are sitting in trades so long.  
  
If you look at the sequence of your MAs as you enter, you have the 50 over the 200 over the 10.  
  
Now, if you look just slightly farther on, you will see that we get the 200 over the 50 over the 10.   
  
Notice how here, the candles don't go back up and close over the 10 but close below and we then get a much stronger drop away?  
  
Now, of course, you will likely get a lower entry (in fact you _will_ get a lower entry) most of the time but the move will be stronger.   
  
Balance that against your more aggressive entry (earlier) that will keep you in a holding pattern for a while (often quite a _long_ while) and could possibly be a turn against that little bit more patience rewarded with a stronger move which you can then stack like a madman as it drops.  
  
However, in the end, it's horses for courses - but perhaps just something to bare in mind.

i know it seems like that would be the case, but because the count of wins and losses will folllow a geometric Brownian motion themselves(along with price) it is extreme rare that after 100 trades the losses and wins will equal each other. That is because in these sample sizes, we will see an arcsine distribution instead of a Gaussian one.  
  
if this wasn’t the case we could easy just find over supply of losers within a series and bet it will even out before the 100 trades are up.  
  
probabilties are some of the strangest behaving things and that is what makes them so fun/challenging to work with.

Yes, I see that there's a variance. That can mean that you get more or less than expected. However, this variance doesn't change the mean/expected value ...

If you look at the sequence of your MAs as you enter, you have the 50 over the 200 over the 10. Now, if you look just slightly farther on, you will see that we get the 200 over the 50 over the 10. Notice how here, the candles don't go back up and close over the 10 but close below and we then get a much stronger drop away? Now, of course, you will likely get a lower entry (in fact you will get a lower entry) most of the time but the...

The detail you point with the MA's is of little notice in my opinion,you have a slope down hard 10 ma which means selling pressure.  
I would sell the break of the bigger MA before that and stack like no tomorrow. Is this SYS keep saying all the time,be aggressive.  
In the entry of the chart i would place a buy if the top was break for a reverse to the mean but with ONLY one position.  
And put a sell around where you point with NO stack as price has travel much,if break the low with momentum i would add a second order,  
with the security of profit i have from the previous position been in profit.  
  
That's my take on that.  
And always on 1:1 leverage maybe 2:1 if im feeling blood ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f609.png?v=15.1).Thanks SYS and VEEX for the tip ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f44d.png?v=15.1)

Yeah, I agree. My point was quite specifically looking at Ivanyo's issue. I wasn't suggesting that one approach was better than the other as such.  
  
If it comes down to it, you can easily trade this using the 10 ma all on its lonesome, with (or without, should you choose) your preferred method of directional bias.

you can boost a system that is just under break even or at break even, it’s just you can easily burn yourself in doing so and you need significantly more resources, occurrences and time in order to do so.  
  
the main reason being, a 0.1% edge vs a break even strategy will behave extremely differently during the extreme scenarios and every 0.1% change produces drastic change in how things behave during those scenarios and over 100,000s of occurrences.  
  
A 0.1% negative edge, will change the behavior during those periods so much, that it can often be too much to deal with. This is why I think it is extremely important to have some kind of edge upon entry, even if it’s 0.1%. It will make a HUGE difference over the long haul.  
  
I will try to make a post showing this in greater detail so you can visualize just how much things change with only the slightest increase or decrease in edge.  
  
Glad to hear you are liking the posts so far ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f60a.png?v=15.1) my goal is to make this one of the highest quality threads on here, providing traders with some real data and information they can use to build their own system or use the TKF one and just modify it, so they can have a fighting chance in this business.

Thanks. It would be a service of great use to everyone. Analyzing trade stats is very painful and labor intensive especially for high volume (# of trades) trader like me. It becomes especially difficult if the strategy does not use hard SL and TP making most of the stats insignificant for analysis. I have looking into "MoveToBE" type trade mgmt strategies and they all will have improvement BUT to biggest determining factor in strategy outcome is WHEN to move to BE (either in distance or trade duration) as what route we take will matter significantly in capping drawdown (which is huge...probably the only thing that must matter imo). Fascinating (and not an easy) subject bro but you are on to a good start to uncover some techniques. Is there a professional trade analyser tool (with What-IF scenarios) that does all this for Spot FX? I am getting burnt out with excel.

Just my 2 cents as I am not even close to you and Anticre when it comes to advanced Math and Statistics skills (I had to google Brownian lol), I can say is this:   
  
_"__count of wins and losses will folllow a geometric Brownian motion themselves(along with price)"_ seems to be in the list of reasons why most strategies fail...remove price dependance and remove SL and TP and you can control the "distribution" of wins and loss. 

Staying in my lane...

Hi!  
  
Sorry, I did not understand what is the point of it?  
There will be 450 winners with 450 * 40 = 18 000 pips  
and 550 losers with 550 * 33 = 18 150 pips. In the end of the day is loss 150 pips.

Dear Scrubpip,  
  
Let a master break it down for you. You're looking to manually stop yourself out at 15 pips. 33-36 range is for emergency stops such as having to fluff your fedora before assisting m'lady.  
  
550x15 = 8250  
  
You'll still be ahead 10,000 pips or so.

Hi killingfloor!  
  
The winning trades will be killed too, there is no edge in such approach.  
I believe there are possibilities for trading in profits using MA-s (trading on direction of the trend) and looking how the draw down figures out trough the trade, as OP is describing in this thread. But it needs more tests.  
Can AI and neural networks help in here? It is big topic and I'm not sure is there any effective way to use it.

Why the emergency stop needs to be so big: >30p, let it be 15p like your manual stop, so there will be even more pips, maybe 20000 ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1)

Hey Sis,  
  
I've got my head around the system (i think) It's the stacking of entries i'm confused with.  
  
It appears in your first pic, that all your TP's are the same level, 4 pips higher than your last entry.  
  
So, correct me if i'm wrong, but in terms of stacking, say you enter long on one of the 7 entry signals, you set a 4TP and 36 SL, a few candles goes by, price goes up down but doesnt take out your TP. As a result of this the MA's catch up and a new different entry signal occurs. So you place another trade, and set a TP of 4 Pips.  
  
Now you have two trades open long, given your picture it seems you would then move your first TP to be the same as the second trade TP, meaning, you're getting a few more pips out of it. Instead of averaging 4, you might average 4.5 or 5.  
  
Is this correct or am I totally lost?  
  
PS. I've spent the last three hours reading a fair amount of your posts, some damn fine logical work, and a great grasp of math and statistics you have.  
  
Edit. I've posted UJ trades which woudl have met the criteria in the last few hours, i'm just not sure there was an opportunity to stack them like the way i wrote above.

Yea that is correct, you can also stack when the first order is in drawdown so then your second orders tp would be moves to the first orders instead of the other way around mentioned in your post.

Interesting but i believe to see the complete picture you also need to look at inverse distribution (max pips towards TP for stopped out trades). If that graph shows different picture then it means this was just a chance outcome (i.e. not enough samples for law of averages to work). It would be great if you could post both distributions (from the same run).  
  
For a pure Brownian process you cannot make profitable system by using random entries no matter how u change the TP and SL. Only reason there could be some small edge in this is because of trends... But since trends are not stationary, this type of edge is not easily captured.

Also, cut your losses. Sitting on a trade >15 pips hoping that it will come back is fighting a losing battle. Important to keep your mindset relative when trading - it's not win or lose. It's win or **_learn_** \- learn from your mistakes and move forward. Don't make the same mistakes again.

Agreed, I can go on a killing spree but quickly negate all my hard work by sitting on losers that run and run. -15 pips and cut it. If not then I hold until 20 since part of Sissys theory is that if it doesn't break that 15 pip DD threshold you have a fighting chance to hit your 4 pip take profit. Perhaps it boils down to the user and their tolerance and skill at gauging overall trends and micro patterns since we operate on the ever-so-deceptive 5 minute chart of death.

I killed it today. Technically two 'losses' which was only due to commission, positive pips, (0.1) and (0.2) but lost money due to commission. Both were set to BE trades after some drawdown and other entry made up for them.

Risk was 0.03 lots per $100 or about 10% if the trade completely fails to 36 pips. Given the high win rate, a 10% risk isnt an issue for me. Remember 36 pips or 10% is worst case, S%*T hits the fan. EG. I enter and then minutes later it falls 36 pips.  
  
  
My brain has been alive today trying to figure out how to stack properly when you're ahead. I've got a few ideas that i might code into a money management EA.

There were 30 trades, and the lot size total was 0.90 lots. So that equates to 0.03 lots on average per trade. 0.03 * 36 pips MAX = 10.8%  
  
4 pips = 1.2% - spread & commission costs me about 0.7 pips. however, i managed to average 4.5 pips for my winners.  
  
Remember it's 36 MAX. Absolute worse case per trade (excluding slippage)  
  
So the whole OMFG you're risking 36 pips to make 4 isn't exactly true. I suggest re-reading and thinking hard about what Sis has written, I did 3 hours of driving today (during asia mind you) which gave me lots of think time.

djhenry  
only what I am trying to say is no one could calculate your risk on mentioned screen form myfxbook. Right?  
But it was done anyway, before you showed your approach.  
Did they take under consideration whole story about MAE/MFA analisys however they say can read and do the math?

Ah, hard to detect the sarcasm in your initial post after a few beers. LOL Whether they took into consideration the MAE/MFA, or money management strategies i deployed, well that's not possible.  
  
I know they could calculate my worse case RRR. But, I couldn't give a toss whether they think it's 'risky' or whatever, math is math, yes there is a chance i'll cop a smack down, but it's all about risk mitigation IMHO.  
  
Currently i'm crunching numbers and math to get it into my thick head, traditionally like many traders emotional trading has been my weakness, but i've followed this system to the rules today, and execution has been close to flawless. A couple of things I wonder, maybe Sis can assist.  
  
Say you have a 1C-10 trade, and it goes against you say 10 pips, and then it it fires another signal, it is wise to take another trade? Statistically you'd think the next trade would have have the same chance of winning as the previous. Then a 2C 10/50 fires prior to TP of the second 1C-10, what I did today, i move all the TPs to that of the original 1C (albeit at BE), so basically we have two trades that will make profit and one a BE. The second trade the second 1C-10 signal might make 7 pips, and then the 2C would make 4 pips, and the first 1C just 1 pip, making a total of 12 pips, or averaged, 4 pips. However, when a 3C fires and all the TP's are extended is when your RRR really ramps up.  
  
Am i on the right track here?  
  
Whether they took into consideration the MAE/MFA, or money management strategies i deployed, well that's not possible.

sis,  
i would lock metta87 from posting here,  
like the trader "davit" is doing this successfully with trolls in his very good&respected thread.  
please do something or this nice thread gets out of control.  
behaviour like metta87 should not be accepted! at least on your thread.  
  
you have the power and you should use it;-)

Yeah sissyphus should lock me up, just cause i ask for a trade explorer or maybe he could just man up a bit and put that damn explorer up.  
so easy but so hard uh  
remind me of eurusdd transient thread, loads of stats, 95% this 97% that, but they all blew their demo accounts, fxjay,eurusdd etc...like i said stats sounds good in theory but how about some proof, sissy has time to write long ass posts, share stats, yt videos, memes but still can’t put that damn explorer up...guess why ?

> In this post we are going to use a 1:1 risk:reward ratio and a edge over the spread that equates to 0.1% - very tiny! Not as bigly as we'd like to see. But it'll do! Without management, just taking the trades as they come, what do you think the probability is that we will see a profit after a series of 100 trades? If you guessed around 50%, you are pretty close, it's actually only 46.759%.

How did you calculate 46.759%?  
As AntiCre said, each trade is 50.05% win rate and expectancy and variance remains constant. That means the distribution after 100 trades follows binomial distribution with win rate 50.05%.  
You need 51 or more winning trades to be positive after 100 trades, that is:  

Inserted Code
    
    
    > sum(dbinom(51:100, 100, 0.5+0.05/100))
    [1] 0.4641868

So actually it's 46.419%.

Probability of your account to be negative after 100 trades is:

    > sum(dbinom(0:49, 100, 0.5+0.05/100))

45.623%, not more than half the time.

Probability of 50 win and 50 loss is about 8% and the rarest case is 100 loss (0.4995^100).  
8% may be small but it is still the most probable scenario. I don't think it's extreme rare, extreme rare scenario is 100 loss.

Arcsine distribution describes No. of periods the equity curve stays at postitive/negative side during 100 trades, not the result after 100 trades.

i think some of you guys think to intellectual, too rational.   
this will not work in the end. trading is more an art than a scientific approach.  
you cant dance, draw pictures or trade successfully with too much thinking and **over** analysing.

My feeling based on far too many years in thus game is that I know this method will work, however the analysis, fascinating as it is - and I do love it, is a problem, simply because if you look at how a human trades this kind of method, they are far more random than they think they are.  
  
I know that I am incredibly selective in my entries - or maybe that's incredibly random - based on those many years of experience and so I know I am operating at an unconscious level a lot of the time.  
  
Many, many, micro variables at work.   
  
I trade the way I trade, not the way anyone else does.

The very nature of "ART" is actually very "SCIENTIFIC".  
  
The only difference between a person who can't dance versus someone who can dance is that the person "who dances with the beat" looks good. And the person "who dances off the beat" is considered weirdo/can't dance/awkward/wrong.  
You can do the most weirdest-bodily-move you can imagine, and there is a fine line between people laughing at you versus people think you look cool is "if you are dancing with the beat".  
On a subconscious level, people can distinguish the body/movement within milliseconds... and the FINE LINE between being labelled as weird/awkward on a dance floor versus having fun and looking good on a dance floor is "moving your body milliseconds off/within the beat".  
It is also the same with music... Music is abundant in science; particularly in math. A professional artist is very scientific.  
  
The difference between looking like an ANGEL versus looking like a WITCH is millimeters of your face symmetry. It is NOT "in the eyes of the beholder" to which he/she finds you beautiful. It is based upon if your face has the SYMMETRY within the golden ratio. If your nose/eyes/mouth is tilted just 1 millimeter... you will be butt ugly. If you don't believe me, go and see a plastic surgeon. There are plenty of SCIENCE within BEAUTY.  
  
I can go on about Painting and Science... Love and Science... Religion and Science... Poems and Science... Writing/Story and Science...  
Trading as an ART is really very SCIENTIFIC.  
TRADING and SCIENCE is about finding the truth.  
You can never attain the highest form of ART/ARTISTRY without ever understanding the SCIENCE ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f601.png?v=15.1) (this including the art of trading).

ok, lets say trading can be scientific, rational...but the market is it not. could we agree with this?   
  
anyway i dont want to make thinks too complicated and everybody thinks different from his/her few of experience.  
i just want to helped some who might run in their circles and dont find the way out.

This is a brilliant subject in its own right, whether there is such a thing as 'natural talent' and whether talent can be taught (to the talentless).  
  
I have been both a professional athlete and sport climber. Nobody taught me, I was completely self coached. Even reaching he top tier, my skill-set was so specialised that those in my field (placekicking) were left alone to do our own thing.  
  
Things have changed a little now, with camps being set up to identify and progress youngsters who show talent but it still at some point comes down to 'can you do it?' before any coaching, which is in effect fine tuning, begins.  
  
As I said, fascinating subject in its own right.

I have been both a professional athlete and sport climber. Nobody taught me, I was completely self coached.

> Ignored

This subject (natural talent vs trained talent) has been bashed to death in the scientific community. (as well as in professional sport, where lots of money is involved.)  
  
Just like Hussain Bolt was predisposition with Height, Long legs and fast-twitch Muscles...  
People are predisposition with a certain level of intellect, natural talents (and Physique).  
And in trading, it is a big edge to be predisposition with such natural talent in accordance with trading.  
Most people on the short end stick will find it hard to accept this.  
  
And the people who preach that anyone can do it (any profession) is subconsciously saying it to be accepted.  
I mean... You come off as an "Arse-Hole" when you say things like _"Dude, you're 5.4ft tall... Give up your dreams of winning the 100m sprint in the Olympics. You are better off spending your time on other productive things you're naturally good at."_  
  
Given enough time, any person on the short end of the stick can learn and perform the task.  
But the reality of life doesn't give most of these individuals the necessary length of time and energy... the allowance to learn and grow.  
Life is filled with hurdles; paying the bills working a 9-5 job, family commitment, health issues, accidents, daily grind and distractions, etc...  
  
As like you said... Professional Coaches are screening for those natural talents...  
Because it takes a lot more effort in time and energy in training someone who doesn't have it.  
Even people screened for natural talents sometimes fall short... taking a bet on someone who doesn't have it is a very risky move.  
If we live in a world where there is no such thing as competition, then everybody can be trained to reach their full potential... and society will benefit greatly from this.  
Unfortunately, we live in a competitive world, where time and delivery is the essence... thus resulting in a lot of people getting left behind. And the society is in a perpetual cycle of carrying the burden of its own doing... society's self recklessness.  
  
Natural talent + Professional Training = Efficient use of time and energy.  
No talent + Professional Training = Extended use of time and energy.  
Natural Talent + No Professional Training = Will eventually get there.  
No talent + No Professional Training = Stop comparing yourself to others and enjoy your life.

and you think with these scientific things someone is successful?  
  
simple things like only the 10MA work. or all kinds of 123 patterns, trading around the daily open line, pivots or just "the line in the sand" is more effective when it comes to real trading results than any scientific approach. its wasted time imo. keep it KISS, because when it comes to decisionmaking, you need to act intuitiv and fast. 

trading is like dancing, don't think and just listen to the music!

I think you clearly have a talent, that of market analysis, at the very least, so hardly "no talent".

Intrepidpips,  
  
From my interaction, Sis.yphusis is a very patient and humble for his level of competency. For what it's worth, his ignore list was zero until now. Currently there is only one person there, that should shed some insight on the extent of his tolerance level.

I appreciate the amount of statistical analysis Sis.yphusis completed for the various system events, and have to give it a try. My only problem is the lack of specific MM or trade management principles/guidelines applied to his statistics. In his 'Boosting Win Rate Through Management' post, he shows that 'proper' stacking or scaling into of positions can boost win rates/profit from 46.759% to 98.78%. This needs to be applied to all 7 possible entries, and then compared as a whole; since a cross of the 10 EMA will likely lead to a PA cross of the 50 EMA and so on (it would be dumb not to take advantage of the high probability PA crosses to enhance total win rate). He mentions specifically NOT trading all the events however, as it be eat up too much margin. Since we know that, it makes sense to scale into positions with much lower lot sizes to compensate.  
  
In my mind this is leads to a MUCH higher probability version of card counting, allowing us to back-count before entering trades. Counting cards in an ideal environment (no shuffle master, 6-8 decks, being sober, etc.) only grants an edge around 0.5 to 1.5%. However once you inject money management into the equation, and bet more on a 'rich count' your potential returns increase. Very few if any FOREX systems EVER give you their true win rates or time/price cycles. This information is absolute GOLD and cannot be discounted.  
  
He even shows with the 4:36 (R:R) win rate series/profit table that profitability shows a marked upturn as the quantity of trades increase. I propose the below to account for the data he's presented regarding the various price cycles of EMA/PA crosses and their respective MAE curves:  
  
1\. Enter trade with ≤ 1% margin (e.g. 0.01 lot) with a TP of 4 & SL of 36  
2\. See below table for MAE and acceptable drawndown  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2886586?d=1531078263)

  
  
3\. Ideally you have entered on the first or second bar of a time cycle for a respective cycle. Within about 20 candles we will know if the trade is a winner or loser (if your TP hasn't already been hit). This is the MOST important part, because depending on PA, it will be clear how long the time cycle will last. 20 candles is 100 minutes or a bit over 1.5 hours. A trend (at least above the 200 EMA) can last much more than the 20 candles that Sis specified as occurring 75% of the time. Once it has been established that the trade is NOT moving against you, the probability that it will be a 'runner' increases.  
  
4\. I've put together a proposed table of scaling into a trade linearly below using sample values/lots:  
  

Attached Image

![](/attachment/image/2886616?d=1531079065)

  
  
We need to develop a method to apply the scaling method to the 7 events as they happen in sequence. I'm open to suggestion, however I would like to cap total margin as a % of total balance @ 10%, unless risk appetite is higher.

Thanks. I was referring in general terms outside of trading more in relation to lack of opportunities in life compared to others. If I had all the opportunities that my kids have now in this information age, I would be a completely different person in the talent space as there was no opportunity to even know of all the possibilities that existed. Anyways, it's more at the philosophical level. When I look at my past, the kids in my high school who were super brilliant and now where they are in life compared to a underdog like me, I am feeling pretty good about it (with no talent and training). I guess it is all relative.

Yeah I see his patience some other OP would have restricted posting to high impact members, I could actually troll this thread myself but self control is playing out, I might get what I want from this thread (actual examples of trades following the methodology -entries and exits) or just let it be.

**Let The Money and The Fools Talk**  
This will be my last post for at least 90 days, could be longer... Till then, I will let the money and the fools talk...  
  
I have loaded up a live trade explorer... No you can't see my size (It's a 5 figure starting equity though). No you can't see my stops and targets. So for all the blind sheep who would like to follow, tough luck. I am sure some of you people will still complain that the TE won't be proof with this privacy. You people will probably say the only way to know if it really works is if I come over to your house, wipe your butt, and then execute the trades in your account for you on your computer...  
  
  
Not sure when I will shut it down, but I guarantee you this:  
\- If I shut it off after 100% gain, scrubs will still come back saying, "It's been turned off for this long so how can anyone know if you are really profitable still?" This will happen if I shut it off after any gain... or any amount of time. **As long as I am not emailing these retards an hourly PnL statement till the day I die, they will still doubt it.**

I think is good for the thread to have a trade explorer for the proof of concept. It is perfectly fine to not reveal stop and targets cause this way someone can figure out the trade management. This is the last piece that each one has to figure out for themselves. You already done a lot to reveal a trading system. Here we have not only a trading system but a method of research that can empower a trader on the "killing floor" with deadliest weapon.  
  
Thanks.

Nice thread Sis... guess its my luck that I am looking at this too late in the day just after you wrote about not posting for next 90 days, will still try my luck incase you wish to help.  
  
If the instrument was DAX instead of EUR/USD, USD/JPY, what would the SL/TP, Entry/Exit criteria be with the same set of SMAs on M1.  
  
Wish I knew how to work with stats and numbers like you do.  
  
Wont mind if you wish to remain to silent, all the best with the TE

This is why I hate the way society and the digital revolution intermesh. To many people think they can sit behind a keyboard and be rude and demanding. This behaviour would not be acceptable in a face to face scenario.  
For the people who want proof the only way is to prove it for yourself.  
The Op has given you an idea to work with.....nothing more..... and he has given it to you for FREE !  
It’s obvious Sis has put a lot of time and effort into producing the material he is posting here.  
Trading is the hardest career path you could chose and quite frankly I think we are all idiots for not pursuing something easier.  
  
So please, take the information that is posted here for what it is worth TO YOU.  
if you don’t agree.....move on.....quietly.  
  
Sis, please don’t let the trolls discourage you. Just keep hitting the ignore button and continue to post as you set out to do.  
Too many threads here get shot down by trolls.....please don’t join that list.

I started a TE and will be following his system, i'm going to try and post screenshots of entries and my scaling strategy. That's the key piece that needs to be extended in this system. Has been very successful so far. Up 5.5% out of 72 trades (many are scaled in on the same move).

Price popped above the 200 EMA and then dropped down a bit, then popped above again. Entered on subsequent bars after PA closed above the 200 EMA. In right now for two separate orders of 2.5 lots each.

Not to overly complicate Sys' system, but I have added a daily Fibo draw for price levels and a CCI indicator. The CCI indicator is fairly accurate in forecasting whether counter trend trades will be successful. I'm not really using CCI to decide trades however, something I'm tracking seperately for correlations.  
  
I'm looking for EURUSD to test the 23.6 Fibo line (1.17463) after PA reliably moves above the 200 EMA (i've moved my TPs slightly below it for ~9 pips potential profit). Looking back to Sys' statistics, he shows that 200 MA price cycles move 10 pips 50% of the time and 30 pips 75% of the time. I'm taking fairly conservative TPs in this range (or below) in confluence with Fibo lines.

PA hit the 23.6 Fibo line. Here's where I'm not 100% sure what to do. My TPs were hit for a nice 9.3/9.6 pip profit for both 2.5 lot orders. Would appreciate any input, especially from Sys

What are your guys thoughts on trading pairs other than EURUSD and USDJPY with this system? I know that Sis only put those two pairs into the rules, but I'm not sure why. I often have difficulty understanding why certain systems only work for specific pairs. Anyone know why that's the case?

The answer is because he ran the statistics for those pairs with this system and obtained the TP/SL and time/price cycles with the given EMAs. I am testing this system with ALL the major pairs to see if it works. He only ran stats on the two you mentioned (I think) so that isn't to say this won't work with them. I'm being conservative with the TP and price/time cycle assumptions however as I'm sure they are different by a certain standard error than the two he ran.  
  
I'm trading so frequently though that it won't be until a bit (~1 month) that I can go back to verify whether other pairs match the systems stats.  
  
As an afterthought to this post, I'm 100% POSITIVE that the time/price cycles are different however so far with the right money management and scaling i've been able to come out ahead. I don't think I'm going to be able to generate the MAE/MFE and cycle info that Sys did with the other pairs however.

This sounds kind of simplistic, and lacking any statistical evidence, but the important reason you cut your losers is because you were WRONG. PA is moving against you, and is doing so very likely in a trend.   
  
Example on how you should ideally trade and react to a loser:  
  
1\. You go in light on a event (e.g. PA closes below 50 EMA) with 0.25 lots  
2\. It becomes obvious (as the statistics show) that PA has moved against you, and PA crosses and closes above 50 EMA.  
3\. You close your sell order for a loss of perhaps 5 to 8 pips  
4\. You go in medium with 1-2 orders totaling 0.5 lots (TP of 4, SL 36)  
5\. PA is likely going to continue to trend above the 50 EMA so you will have additional opportunities to scale in  
6\. Ideally, you will capture the new price cycle with 3-4x the lots you used in the sell order  
  
This is what I have been doing after I cut my losers, and as long as i'm not trading during extremely low volatility session times it has been more or less consistent. The price and time cycles are NOT always consistent, and that is why error'ing on the low side with smaller TPs is very very VERY important. Don't get attached to losers. Cut them and MOVE ON.

Most likely E/U and U/J were chosen for their low trading costs = spread.  
why would you chose a pair with a spread of 3 pips if you can do with a pair with a spread of 1 pip or lower.  
no need to try other pairs.

Nice work, i've cracked 1200 pips and just over $1000 starting with a $100 live account since friday.  
  
Curious to know what EA you're running? I run one that auto sets TP 4 and SL 36.

Just a order entry tool I built on one of those ea builder websites (not sure I'm allowed name the website here?)  
The box with 5 in it is risk%(yeah I Know It should be set to 0.33)  
CL closes all long positions  
CS.....short positions only  
the rest is pretty self explanatory.  
  
Well Done on your results but watch your risk, 1000% per week is unsustainable....slow and steady...I've found overconfidence is a killer.  
Now is the time you really want to reduce your size you have a nice little account there to work with.

Just took some more on EU, and i'm done for the day, I've withdrawn my initial amount and lowering, my risk this last week started off at 0.3 lots per $1000 and i dropped it two days ago to 0.25 lots, and today down to 0.2 lots, managed 120 pips today, which is lower than average, but as you said, overconfidence and emotions are a big killer of accounts, and I feel myself entering the danger zone, so its time to have a break.  
  
I was looking at writing an EA for the TP management, especially stacking, one where, when you open trades, assuming it's at a higher price than your previous entries, it moves ALL the tp's to +4 from your last entry, saves manually moving, i've missed a few pips because of this when you're just almost at a TP and a new trade presents.

Nice work on the risk management / stacking. Can you provide the EA builder you're using or your current build? I'm working on a similar EA for this (very very simple, will likely only throw alerts) and want to add the scaling element to it.

My EA is a really basic one, it just sets the initial TP and SL as each trade as its placed.   
  
I'm trying tp modify the code myself, to achieve stacking TP's but it's not working yet.

It isnt going so well with your trading sis.ypjus you dont cut your loosers and you are not stacking as you have talked abaut it is ok too stay in some loosers when you are in a strong trend ore it looks like it will turn around but some loosers are just loosers and they can go and go and go against you 100`ds and yes 1000`ds of pips and never turn around....keep the loosers short and winners shorter but make sure you have many many many more winners than loosers that is scalping..... 

You win some you loose some do both with peace of mind

Loving the system so far, have been making consistent profits with it. Main problems I'm having (and I'm sure others can relate) are that I'm extremely tempted to over trade and I'm closing losers too fast, not letting the trend do its thing. Still, all props to you use Sis for this system, it's awesome!

I am the same, sometimes, i'll stack it long with still some orders short, and close the shorts, because it looks to be moving long, only for it to whipsaw and it would have TP on the shorts and then taken the longs too.  
  
Remember the stats, each trade placed has a ~90% chance of hitting TP within 24 hours, I try keeping this in the back of my head

A key prerequisite to this system, and most in general, is the quality of the service/product offered by the broker. This includes average [spreads](/brokers/spreads "View Live Spreads on the Broker Guide"), commission, execution of trades, liquidity, etc. The spreads and commissions especially boost your winners and minimize your losers. I've tweaked Sys' system and am taking extremely small TPs, usually between 1 and 1.5 pips. What this is allowing me to do is trade far more often and achieve higher daily profit numbers. If you compare my TE with Sys's, you'll see that his time in trade is ~92% vs. my 24%.   
  
It's not all apples to apples however, as he is using a U.S.-based broker with lower leverage (50:1) compared with my 400:1 and is trading live vs. my demo. Order execution and spreads may not be identical. The tell of the tape however lies with his 34 closed trades in 5 days vs my 38 in 2 days. I'm averaging 19 trades a day vs his ~7 (almost 3x his frequency). The statistics he provides cannot be denied with the price/time cycles, however a good broker with rock bottom costs can allow you to do things most cannot. If you want to win more, you need to trade more. You will lose more, but the ratio should hold provided you stick to the game plan and cut your losers to get into winners.  
  
If I didn't have an ECN with extremely tight spreads and $2/$100k rips, I would not be able to do what I am doing. My average time in trade is usually no longer than 5-10 minutes, with the longest typically open under 1 hour. Minimizing the time it takes to babysit and scale into a trade has done wonders to my win ratio.

Rainingpips i am also trading for 1-3 pips mostly and i just have a coupple of quick questions for you sometimes i get a spike against me that takes out many trades of profit if i cut it at once if i let it run it can come back eventually but also keep going against me so i have been forced too take some big losses once in a while i see you have 38 trades with only two losses with one pip how do you stay away from 5-10 pips spikes ore even more and withch timeframe are you trading...I am not a total neewbee been trading for 4 years and are proffiteble but sometimes i give back too the market all too much...

The type of scalping I am doing does not work well with volatile spikes resultant from news. You can certainly trade after news, as PA returns to logical patterns off the EMAs. My largest drawdowns have been no more than about 5-6 pips, and those I normally scale in to build larger lot sizes for a trade (adjusting TPs manually to the original trade's TP). Unfortunately, I think I have been extraordinarily lucky and fully expected to cut many more trades than I have so far. I thought I had more losers, but the TE only shows two: one for -0.1 pips and the other -4.4 pips. Next week should generate at least 95 trades or so, and we'll have a better grasp on losers/drawdown now that I have the broker situation stabilized. I went through 2 or 3 different iterations of this TE last week due to changes in leverage and commission structure.  
  
All the trades I took were either the subsequent bar following PA breaking an EMA or a retrace back and bounce off an EMA. I'm not really taking signals from the 10 EMA however, and instead focus on the 50 and 200 EMAs. These have proven to be MUCH higher probability especially for the retrace bounces. These particular events generate VERY high probability 1-3 pip moves. My broker setup is the only thing allowing me to do this. Any rips higher than $2/$100k traded wouldn't permit the 1 pip TPs.  
  
Mage999, I have found if you follow the rules of this system, you should generate very high probability winners. In order to know for sure whether this is really working, we'll have to generate around 400-500 trades to break the 95% confidence interval according to his chart. Should be about mid-August. If this is consistent by then, I'll go live and switch to a live TE (with display restrictions similar to Sys'). I am already very optimistic however, as the 'Boosting Win Rate Through Management' post showed a 98.78% probability of profit and i'm @ 94.73% as of Friday.

Thank you very much for your feedback raining pips it is funny i also use 10 ema also 35,50 and 200 like much like you and trade bounces of them with the trend i also have a insidebar setup that i get 5-10 trades of everyday good setups togheter with linnear regression that tells me the short term trend i only take them if the insidebar is in the same direction of trend and no more than 4-5 candle later you get the breake out theese trades gives usually a little more pips than the bounces....I will post the indis here...The best bounces i think is bollinger and EMA confluence...And for broker i fund that [ic markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile") are the best that i have found with a fixed commision of 7 dollars pr.lot traded and 0 spread on majors and 0-0.6 on Minors if you found any better than that please share here is a link for them if you are a scalper:<http://icmarkets.com/?camp=20604> i dont either trade bouces of the 10 but in a down trend and i get a close over the 10 and a close below i open a trade on first candle after close below and the opposite for uptrend...Question do you close out the trades at once if they go against you like 2-3 pips ore do you sometimes wait for it too come back...I have done both and suffered two margicalls where broker kicked me out of trade i have recovered after many days of trading but i really try and dont let thet happen again...I am trading 0.78 lots and have a stoploss at 50 dollars and try too get 20-25 dollars on each win but mostly they are 5-10 dollars 0.8-1.5 pips i have noticed that if you want more than 2 pips you often need too wait for next candle and i like the trade too be under a minute...I use a period converter and are trading 3 min offline charts i found that too get the most valid setups and quick returns....The entries are easy its when too cut the losses that are difficult with this Kind of trading i have the same average loss as average win but is one week since i opened my account and that can also be a little lucky that i havent taken a big loss i have been down over 50% but with trend i have waited for it too turn and it has become a winner instead i think its best too take a loss at 5 pips ore more....When you say 2/100 k traded does that mean that you only pay 2 dollars pr lot traded if so i would really like too know witch broker offer that....Would appriciate if you would answer my questions...I have 73% winrate since open account a week ago with my last account that i payed more for trades(spread) i had 80% winrate for a long time more than that over a long time is a bonus in my eyes so if you can stay over 90 youare good..

Win rate doesn't matter as much as probability of profit. The way to control that is through scaling into a trade and cutting a loser. For the majority of my trades (the current TE trades isn't the best reference for this, as I was playing around with the lots) is to go into an 'event' (trade opportunity) with ~1% of your balance/margin. In my experience, you will know very quickly whether you are in a winner or a loser. The tell tale sign is that PA will quickly break the EMA again in the opposite direction after an EMA test or without one (and just go through). I've posted an example below that shows both concepts of scaling in and then cutting a potential loser and turning it into a winner.

In the screen shot, you'll see PA break both the 10 and 200 EMA. You'd make your first 1% entry with a 1 pip TP, which would be quickly hit (that first green candle after PA closes above 10 EMA was worth about 7 potential pips, with a 4 pip drawn down). Then you could come back in after the next 10 EMA bounce with another 1 pip TP at the next 10 EMA test (second green arrow). Lots of PA testing an EMA is normally indicative of a reversal, so be careful. This is seen mid-event and then results in a break (red arrow). This could have been potential loss of 1.6 pips, but would/should have been closed quickly to minimize. Trading the 10 EMA will produce more trades, but less 'high probability' winners. Ideally, you'll scale into winning event with 4-6% (4-6 trades) and your losers will be only 1%'ers.  
  
Magne999, I messaged you with the broker and procedure to acquire the $2/$100k rips. And yes, that is $2 for 1 standard lot.

Here are two more indicators i use for confirmation of trades the first one is the most relible currencie strenght indicator i have found so you dont get into a trade where the bacecurrencie is not in synch....The other is a volume indi that color the candle red if it goes down on high volume and green on up on high volume after a colored candle up ore down the chance of it too reverse are larger than without i use that a lot on the bounces...

Magne999, are you scaling into positions or going into trades with one large lot size?

Today i took the trades head on i saw your scaling post with 8 different lotsizes but at your explorer you only used 0.18,0,9 and 9 lotsize on last 15-20 trades it doesnt fit very well with your scaling chart.....LOL....If i can keep the win% over 80 its not very probebly that i we will see more than 3-4 cons...losses so its better too go out with smaller lots and tripple after two losses ore stacking open more possitions when it goes against you,but the loss i had today i got tree cons.Candles against me and 5 more after cutting the loss so if i had stacked there i would have taken a lot of pips with 7 posisions the stacking is a kind of martingale and sooner ore later it will go against you and never turn around i prefer to cut the loss quick and increase the lotsize after two losses since we are after 1 pip there will not be that many losses after each other...Thats my opinion after 65 trades you have a 86% winrate so going out small and increasing....that is my opinion...I dont mean too be smart ore anyting i aprichiate all help from you with my new broker i just wondered abaut your lots when you say scaling....I opened a 15 lotrade today and with commision and 0.4 spread i was down 75 dollars when i opened the trade its cheaper than [IC markets](/brokers/ic-markets "View IC Markets Broker Profile") anyway even the spread isnt 0 because with IC it would have been 105 dollars in commision alone and the spread there are mostly 0 but sometimes 0.1....As i said before i trade the 3 min chart and this tread uses 5 min but my system is very much the same i trade more bounces of the 35,50 and 200 but i also use a 21 period slope hull ma with linear regression too see shorttermtrend instead of the slope 10 ma i use the 10 in the same way you do here also i have learned a coupple of new things gere reading this tread so thanks too sys.pus i joked a little with him in the start but hopes he survives that...LOL like tree trades i took last week of the 35 here

Why would you bother with losses and doubling the lot sizes after losses? Why not just keeping them equal and small instead and let couple of winning positions securly open when trend present itself....when you can identify trend direction, do the double lot stacking in those moments, if you must. 

The biggest risk is not taking a risk.

I will do some scaling tomorrow starting with 0.5 ore 1 lot and doubble lotsize every 5 pips ore soo but mostly when bollinger bands are flat and i get a close ouside then its usually limited how far it goes before coming back inside usually at next candle but if not i will scale i dont like to stack the bounces because when it breakes the ressistence/support its difficult too know how far it will go...I see sys.pus has 5 ours trade duration and i think that is very long even if he`s stacking and with a 4 pip target...But that just me...lol....I am no expert just trying too keep the head over water...

<raining pips you sure are a better trader than i am i did one scaling ended with a profit of 300 and someting but started with 3lots that was a mistake so ended at 15 lots before it turned around and that was way too much....I watched your explorer now and you are up 250 pips in under a week thats impressive...

Scaling is probably the wrong terminology. I'm averaging into trades to move my average price closer to the market price as PA moves against me. PA never moves in a straight line forever, and WILL retrace. I'm trying out something a bit different right now where I'm averaging into a potential counter trend to catch either retracements or a change in trend. Scaling, at least how Sys described it, is adding more lots into a winner to bump up the average pip value. It's similar to averaging in (at least what I'm doing), however is potentially more dangerous as you can't be certain when PA will turn against you. Very important to have very clear goals and TPs when scaling in so as not to have your new average price over taken when the trend goes against you; and it WILL eventually go against you.  
  
The trick with either scaling or averaging into trades is to START SMALL. Like REALLY small. The current system i'm using starts with using 0.05% of margin and never moves beyond 38.4%. What this allows me to do is to take a total potential 160 pip move AGAINST me, while never being more than 20 pips away from break even. Have you EVER seen PA move 160 pips without changing trend or at LEAST a 20 pip retracement? I haven't, unless we're factoring in some sort of black swan event that almost crashes a currency.  
  
With this current system, you're either winning small, averaging into a loser (counter trend) to build up your total trade's lot size, or potentially winning big when the trend changes or there's a 20+ pip retracement (depending on how many lots you have averaged into the trade). My last 3 trades were all USDJPY sell orders, with respective lots 0.03, 0.09 and 0.21. As PA moved against me every 15 pips, I picked up a new order a magnitude of 2.33-3 larger than the last. In total, i hade PA move about 30+ pips against me before the trend changed. Ended up with +49.8 total pips spread out through the various orders on that move.  
  
Edit:  
  
To do this method, you're gonna need $3k+ to make it work. Depending on how far PA moves against you, you could be into 7.66 lots. I'm looking into average price cycles and candle cycles using this method to confirm, but it should stay fairly consistent. Right now I'm using the same TE to do this in addition to trading larger lots on the EMA/PA crosses (with the 1-4 pip TPs).

This is zigzag legs with minimum of 10 pips:

![](/attachment/image/2901094?d=1531927908)

  
As you can see, you need a really agressive martingale, to get at BE or small profit every time. I tried various systems, but the rewards are too small for this.  
I tried to MarginCall account when zigzag leg goes for example >= 60p (it's only 0.5% of time). But after all I lose more, than win.

It's stats from zigzag indicator. I recorded every zigzag leg for last 14 years. The minimum pips of zigzag leg is 10p. And you can see how much that 10p zigzag leg can extend from my previous post.  
Chart show ranges(ZZLegPips) with their quantities(count)- how much times it occour. As you can see when zigzag gets to 10 pips, there is 70% than that zigzag doesn't extend to 20 pips and 30% that it extends to >=20 pips and so on.

As far as I can tell, 'Zigzag' has little in common with my table. I am entering at set pip intervals (20 pips) with the lot sizes indicated. Unless my math is wrong, I don't see how this would fail terribly provided a trader had a sufficient amount of margin and didn't overextend. My table never extends beyond 38.4% of margin, and that's after a 160 pip move.   
  
Ideally, the trader would have a realistic TP in mind for the group of trades past the BE and take it. I'm still playing around with it, but took a +49.8 pip win using this system as indicated in my TE. This is moving into the realm of another thread however. After I test this more I may open a new thread. I was really only using it as an example for money management and averaging/scaling into positions which can be applied to Sys' Killing Floor system. The TE results speaks for itself, and the vast majority of it was obtained using Sys' system.

I'm trying out something a bit different right now where I'm averaging into a potential counter trend to catch either retracements or a change in trend.

There was some interesting research done on averaging-in a few years ago by a couple of guys called Ron Schoenberg and Al Corwin. I don't have a direct link but shouldn't be too hard to find if you check the usual places. Might be worth your while reading.

The biggest drawback i see with the averaging in is that you sometimes have too sit by your computer 2 and 3 days without leaving if you go 160 pips and back say 60 there are weeks when range are under 40 pips on USD/JPY its not often but i remember one time it did so you get a drop for a 100 pips that takes a coupple of days and then playing in a range of ten pips for a coupple of days you will be pretty tired this is putting it on the edge but possible.....You have done one trade like this and it lasted for 18 ours....Just saying...

I think i like the 1-3 pips TP instead i like too keep my trading days at 6-8 ours maximum even less if possible

So I haven't found the exact research/study by Schoenberg and Corwin, but I found an article detailing their basic premise. I've summarized the finer points/example below:  
  
"  
Let's say you have $4 to invest. If a future's price recently drops to $2, though you expect it to eventually revert to $3. Should you...  
  
A) buy 1 contract at $2, and wait for the price to _possibly_ drop to $1 and then buy 2 more contracts (_i.e._ averaging-in); or  
B) buy 2 contracts at $2 each; or  
C) wait to _possibly_ buy 4 contracts at $1 each?  
  
The resultant probability:  
A) _p_ *(1*$1+2*$2) + (1-_p_)*(1*$1)=1+4 _p_ ;  
B) 2; and  
C) _p_ 4*$2=8 _p_.  
"  
So as far as profit is concerned, A < C or B according to there research. In other words, averaging in produces less potential profit. The problem with this approach is that it assumes an outcome, as it must. In order to formulate these scenarios, they must be mutually exclusive and conditionally exhaustive. Conditionally exhaustive in this scenario has omitted ALOT. Price for a currency pair in the next 24 hours is unknown to all but the central banks, and even to them it is known only within narrow limits. 'Counter-Trend Averaging In' (I will surely come up with a more eloquent name for it) presumes to capture a new trend within the cycle of the preceding trend.   
  
What is unknown is when the current trend will end, and the next begin. The next trend's price and time cycle is unknown as well. What is known is that PA does not travel in one direction forever. There are shifts in trends, retracements within those trends that do not themselves constitute a change in trend and times when there is no describable trend at all (plateau). A "trend" itself is subjective, and a shift/change might be different for different people.   
  
The barebones strategy is to buy/sell your way into the best possible price point for when the trend inevitably shifts. This operates on sheer price action, either upward or downward and does not really include any indicators, expert advisors or resistance/support lines that define a "trend." The chart I posted permits a single move of up to 160 pips against the trader in a given price cycle. I don't have the data, and it is heavily dependent on the currency pair, but it's hard to believe that PA would move in a consistent 160 pips without a retracement or change in trend. I've decided that I'm going to create a new thread for all this, and I welcome critique. I've stopped 'averaging in' with small lots with the TE I have now, and will create another one for this strategy. My assumption is that the more volatile the currency pair (respecting the average spread), the better this will work. TPs will be based on fibo retracements and likely include a trailing take profit once the trade(s) go green. There's lots of work to be done gathering data however, so the new thread won't happen for awhile.

Please post the link to thread in here when you have begun it, I'm sure a lot of traders from this system (and almost any other, for that matter) would be super interested. Awesome info btw, definitely something to think about!

Magne999. Good to see you're enjoying FinPro. I got crazy last night and overleveraged. Cut my gains from 45% to 20% by disregarding the scale-in strategy and overleveraged. This system is very successful, however don't make the mistake I made and get over-zealous and over-confident. The urge to up your lots is there due to the high success rates of the trades, but a bad move can wipe out a lot of progress quickly.

Just too answer this i will keep my risk too under 3% going live and i have also overleveraged some with the demo that is what they are for....Its easy too get wiped out if you dont cut loss at 2-3 pips with the 1 pip TP...I am depositing sometime this weekend and will shoot you a PM on how it goes i think that bitcointing is a little scetsjy and am not very happy abaut it but should be safe i like skrill ore neteller better...Happy trading everyone and green pips as long as we can see...

With FinPro, you can also do a wire transfer, and I would 100% recommend doing wire transfer for withdrawls. I've heard of problems across several brokers concerning withdrawls via BTC.

I already have a live account with them, but only funded with a small amount of BTC (what I had lying around). I'm setting up Skrill now to deposit. I've never used it though.

A better (albiet paid) option is FX Synergy. I can't link it because it violates T/S but it will do what your 'TradePanel' expert will do and much much more. I'm using it to group and scale into trades. It's a 3rd-party program that links to a MT4 trading account you have open.

Im in the process of having an indicator made that ouputs live trade data regarding MAE and MFE to excel, so then it can be compared to historical MAE/MFE data for each pair.  
  
I assume there will be some difference between pairs, albeit small, so i want to run tests on individual pairs for accuracy and then i'll code something in Excel VBA to help us determine mathematically whether or not we should cut a trade. Help take the emotion out of it.

Do you trade the EMA breakes and if you do whats your target i trade some of thoose braekes also togheter with my own approach i have looked at the EMA 10 breakes and total with a 1-4 pips target it is at 50/50 so you need some more confirmations i use momentum if the candles are big before breake its more likely that it still will push on after the breake other confirmations will be very appritciated....Try and keep this system/tread alive...

What i am researching now is a little deeper into Sis' stats, I want to know, for each pair, whether the MAE and MFE changes, dependant on the time of day, the day or the week, the month of the year. etc,   
  
I assume there will be differences, the MAE and MFE of a EU trade would differ in the Asian Session one would expect to that of the MAE and MFE of the UJ. Will post results when complete, just dont expect it to be done anytime soon.

I hate to be negative but this method makes literally no sense what so ever.  
As the OP claim in-order for this method to work you had to be able to cut losers and let winners run.  
He then goes on to post a bunch of stats showing how he uses moving average to determine which traders were more likely to be winnings / losers.  
That's very unlikely as if he was able to gain a edge in such a manner then all the OP had to do was mark random areas on the chart and later check the moving average to determine if this trade is more likely to become a winner than losers if so then he could actually place the trade.  
So even if the OP system was profitable , what he is doing is very counterproductive as the edge would be in the moving average position and by using this method he would simply be paying addition spread.  
From the TE however I think it safe to say there is no edge in even the moving average stats.

He doesnt use MA to determine if trade is likely to be a winner or a loser, he uses, MAE and MFE.

My bad didn't actually dig deeper as the method made no sense when I tired putting it together , as the edge would lies in MAE AND MFE IF this information can still be obtain without having to place a trade ,The system would still be flawed.

Basically what OP has done has generated statistics for MAE and MFE based on the system.   
  
If you trade the system as described you can then use the historic MAE and MFE data to make trading decisions on the probability of whether you are in a winning or losing trade, if the probability is that you're in a losing trade, cut it, however, if the probably is that you're in a winning trade, albeit, it might still be in draw down, stack it. The edge lies in the trade management, and knowing when to cut and when to stack, this changes the edge.  
  
I've managed 60 pips on EU alone today in a couple of hours.

Yes I understand that , but in theory that makes zero sense ,   
the TP is 4 pip and SL is 36 , therefore you will be in drawdown when you determine if the trade is likely to be a winner or loser using the OP method.  
Why not pretend you enter a trade or enter a trade on a demo account , use the method to determine a point where the trade would likely become a winner then go on your real account and actually enter the trade.   
Then if you had draw down of 6 pip , you would win 6+ (4 the original TP ).  
Wouldn't this make more sense than random entries ?

But entries are not random. Entry is based on 7 rules, each of which hits its target of 4 pips about 90% of the time.  
  
Therefore, using MAE and MFE data as the trade progresses, one can determine as time goes on, whether or not that particular trade, is likely to be a winner or a loser. IF it's in draw down of about 10-15 pips after 60 candles, its likely to be a winner, so i'd add to the position, but instead of aiming for just 4 pips of the second trade, the ideal is to set that TP of the second trade to that of the first trade's TP, so instead of 4 pips for each trade eg. 8 pips, you may get 14-19 pips from the second trade + 4 pips from your original.  
  
If the trade moves against your quickly, statically it's likely to be a loser, and you should cut it, rather than just hope it comes back.  
  
Remember the 36 pip SL is for ermegency, power blackout, internet drop out, black swan, etc. Rarely, you should hit this level.

You are contradicting yourself ,  
If you win 90% of the time with A SL of 36 and a TP of 4 then the entries are indeed random and if you say otherwise i would love for you to explain how so.  
4 x 9 - 36 x 1 = 0.  
You can simply place trades on demo and if a trade is in drawdown of 10-15 pip after 60 candles then you actually enter a trade on your real account turning the draw down into potential profit.As that trades is more than likely a winner according to you and the Op.  
This means that the entire method is useless following that logic.  
Again I doubt that even is an Edge in anything the OP said , His TE speaks for itself.  
But even if it did contain an edge the method itself would be counter productive.  
PS if a trade with a stoploss of 36 and takeprofit of 4 has a dawndown of less than 16 the odd of it winning is over 50% regardless of the number of candles.

Did you backtest this system? It's strange that you get positive pips, when Sysiphus are in drawdown now. I tested cutting lossers short idea, but can't find any edge in it: [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post11206143](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11206143#post11206143)

Its hardly a surprise your 'back test' didn't work. Obvious troll is obvious.

I wrote that I tested **only cutting lossers short idea** , and wrote how I did it. If you've done enough backtests, you should know, that everywhere it is 50:50 win%, no matter if it is moving average or candle open/close. Moving Average doesn't give you more than 50% win. So, the edge should be in cutting lossers short idea. I think cutting lossers short idea should be universal and you could apply to any strategy if it works.

If you've done enough backtests, you should know, that everywhere it is 50:50 win%, no matter if it is moving average or candle open/close. Moving Average doesn't give you more than 50% win. So, the edge should be in cutting lossers short idea. I think cutting lossers short idea should be universal and you could apply to any strategy if it works.

Some people , prefer to learn the hard way.  
If someone literally sat down and examine the logic behind this system they would quicker realize how useless it really is.  
Even if the OP did manage to fine an edge the way the system was develop , it would still bring negative return,  
This is basically a system with no edge that encourages you to stack position meaning the spread will eat away at your account quickly.  
Also 100+ pip means nothing 1 full stack loser can exceed this amount , or a few stack losers which was cut.  
don't believe look at the TE posted , some of the loser exceed 200 pip so really if 120 pip is your proof of profitability idk what to tell you.

Why should I?  
  
I mean, if someone isn't smart enough to do the research and actually study the math, probability, standard deviations, etc etc of a particular system, why should I waste my time? I don't care whether you believe its working for me or not.  
  
The way I trade the system (as OP described) works for me, you can make it work for you too, if you invest the time.

How can i make it work for me when it’s not even working for op ?duhh   
  
And you re right I dont believe you at all, you’re the one saying you turn a 100$ to a 1000$ using this system in less than a week ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f925.png?v=15.1), that you ve made 100 pips today, so why be scared to prove it ? You already screenshoted your myfxbook 100$ account here [https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post11234522](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11234522#post11234522), so why not show to us how much it’s worth now ?  
your guru is in red, how can you be in green ?

This is one of my accounts, i have multiple $1000 accounts as psychologically for me, trading a $1000 account is less stressful than a $10k+ account  
  
In fact, i actually trade a $100 account, and it copies to my $1000 accounts.  
  
Take close note of the file name

Personally I find if i physically see my trade screen saying -$2 i dont give a fuck, but if i see my screen showing -$2000 i self doubt. That's the purpose of using lower account to trade with and copying to larger accounts, before you start nit picking and carrying on.

Exactly, you've got no idea. You can't even execute trades on a system that was spoon fed to you let alone create one yourself.  
  
If you had half a brain, you're realise the TE shown is NOT this system, in addition, it hasn't been actively traded in over a week.   
  
Why? who knows. I frankly don't care.

Sis' didn't explain whether his stats were for EURUSD, USDJPY or both combined. So as I don't know this fact, i've set out to find out for myself AKA I will USE MY OWN BRAIN. Something that perhaps you should consider doing, then, and only then, will you have any chance of success.

This system could never work , and even if it did.  
The edge would be used in the most inefficient way possible, literally all you do is talk BS like people aren't smart enough to trade the method.  
How can you even mention probability when you clearly have no idea what that means.  
You claim the Entries had a edge , yet claim the win rate was 90% with risk to reward of 1/9 , anyone with basic knowledge of probability would know how ***** stupid that sounds.  
You claim that the OP ran a bunch of test and found out that if your trade experience a draw down of 10-15 pip after 60 candles you are likely to win , anyone with knowledge of probability would know that as long as the draw down remained under 16 pip the odds of winning is over 50%.  
but despite all this the dumbest thing about the system is the method of entry even if everything the OP said did provide an edge ( it does not , don't be a retard ), why not just pinpoint a point on the chart wait 60 candles then if the draw down is less than 10/15 pips then you makes your entry , this would be a much better way to used the edge ( again there is no edge ).   
I have spend a total of 5 min reading what the OP claim before my BS meter was on high , didn't even brother finish reading I can only imagine the BS obtain within.  
Also you have not share any proof to show this system works , a withdrawal means nothing.   
And tbh you don't have to because there no way anyone with a brain would never think system can work.  
NO disrespect to the OP as his intentions her good and he too actually believe in his system.

So you spent a whole of 5 minutes reading, but didnt actually think, nor actually 'bother finish reading'? Yet you comment like you understand the system, congratulations, you're a moron. *clap clap*  
  
If you had actually have read, you'd realise it's NOT a system with a RRR of 1/9.

my god you are an idiot, you stack entry therefore it will vary but the principles of the system is base on 1/9 RRR.  
And again you dodge my questions and responds with some bs that 100% false. TP OF 4 SL of 36 variation occurs however due to stacking ofc so call it whatever RRR you want.  
It only takes a few min to understand the system the OP , he describe it in details on the first page , then I took a few min and read thru some of the addition post he made.  
Then apply some logic and realize that even if there was an edge in the method the system is terrible , then look and examine his TE earlier trades.  
The system is trash , the edge is base on a bunch of useless stats , I have explain countless time why this system can't work and everytime you avoided what I said and respond with something like you aren't smart enough or moron.  
If you enter trade with a TP of 4 and a SL of 36.  
and after 60 , 80 , 20 , 200 candles or any amount of candle your stats state , you experience a draw-down of only 10-15 pip would you add to your position ?  
because technically speaking the odds of you winning is still over 50% as long as the draw-down is not over 16 pip regardless of the number of candles.  
The only way this system would have an edge is if somewhere in the OP data , it showed that after X ( any amount of candle ) you are likely in a winner with as long as you drawdown is less than 17 pip , 18 , 19 etc ....  
So please so me data anywhere in this thread that state that I have a higher chance of winning at any point with drawdown higher than 16.

Shame this thread has come to this...  
  
I guess what people need to understand is that although there is a 80-90% win ratio with TP 4 pips and SL 36 pips, you do not hold until you hit the full 36 pip stop loss. That is there for you in case of emergency (lose power, lose internet connection etc etc).  
  
In reality, I personally hold and if it goes to -15 pips I am out. If you randomly enter trades, you will have an 80-90% win ratio per sis analysis. However you need to remember we are not entering trades randomly - we are entering them at the optimal areas of value to maximize our chances even further (i.e. when 10/50/200 MA give you the right signal). For example, you would enter here;

There is a similar thread (CHOROS) that trades off similar principles and you can see that people over there have had good outcomes with this system. Regardless of what people's TE says, at the end of the day it's your money and up to you whether you think something works or not - put in the work to determine whether it does and if you don't think it does just move on. No need to be petty and have arguments over an internet forum.

> Why Is It Called The Killing Floor? Most people who step foot on the market floor each and every day die there. They spend all day sharpening their tools but never practicing their techniques. As a result, they are food for the wolves. Nine times out of ten, it’s not the strength of your weapon that matters, but your ability to maximize its utility. The goal each day is to hit the floor as hard as you can killing as many pips as possible.

The killing floor? you got killed by the markets looking at your TE. It happens to noobs. Don't care how smart you are. Brains does not equal profits   
  
Yet to see a profitable trading system on FF backed by a profitable TE.   
  
It's noobfactory after all, newbies join and years,a decade later they are still a noob.  
  
You join as a noob and leave as a noob. Wiser for the experience but still an unprofitable noob.  
  
Experienced noobs spend a lot of time on FF teaching new noobs to be a more experienced noob-that is what noobfactory offers

It's the hazard of "free-speech." But an experienced eye can glance at a thread and know whether or not it's worth further looking into. Even if it's fool's gold, someone can still derive some ideas from it. In any case, it's still better than looking at an empty forum.

Exactly, trade it how it works for you, or don't, it doesn't matter to anyone. I'm having success with the system, and idc if losers like metta don't believe me.  
  
I crunched some data the other day, was able to determine that ~90% of your 4 pip winners, will NOT exceed 15 pips draw down, and ~95% will not exceed 21 pips. So as you say, letting a loser run to 36 pips should rarely, if ever happen, it's an emergency stop, but some people cant seem to grasp this simple concept.  
  
These figures were based on 310,612 trades, following all 7 rules mechanically over a 15 year period on EU. I'm yet to simulate the time MAE and MFE vs Candle hold time, my PC is still crunching the data.   
  
I trust Sis's stats, but it's unknown which pair he used, or whether he used both pairs, in any event he's gone for a bit, and I want to break down his stats a bit more specifically into pairs, time of day, day of week and determine for myself whether this impacts MAE/MFE and if so, how it can be exploited for profit. There might be a difference, UJ behaves differently in the Asian session than EU for example, so, IMHO that should be factored in statistically when making trading decisions, rather than a simple 15 or 21 pip hard fixed SL. I'm yet to run the simulation on UJ as i'm still crunching numbers for EU. But it will happen, in time.  
  
I like statistics, and ultimately, i'll program an Excel App and gives you a perspective candle by candle, trade by trade, based on time of day, day of the week and rule, to allow you to make better trading decisions. EG. When to hold, when to abandon ship and when to stack the hell out of it.

Experienced noobs spend a lot of time on FF teaching new noobs to be a more experienced noob-that is what noobfactory offers ![](https://resources.faireconomy.media/images/emojis/64/1f602.png?v=15.1)

The only time reverse RR works in my experience is when you have a PROVEN strategy with 80+% entry accuracy backed by at least 500 trade stats and supported by myFXbook to believe in your entry system. I focus on both entry and exit accuracy...they are the holy Grail. Everything else is just garbage in your trading stats.  
  
Edit: By Entry/Exit %Accuracy, I mean the one that myFXbook beautifully displays for historical trades once you authenticate your account information. I believe it is the only site that has this capability.

Dude, I am on your ignore list. Why are you replying to my post?  
  
If you have over 100 posters on your ignore list then what is the point of being on FF? Obviously you hate being on forums, why still be around? 

You came here for the truth and let me unveil it for you

It's like talking to a brick wall here, one last post and you stay permanently on my ignore.  
  
The concept you fail to grasp is that if you is that if you cut your losses at 16 pips automatically you will instantly LOSE more, and therefore your win rate will not be 90% win rate.  
  
What I said was very clear.... If you set a 36 pip stop loss, (albeit the part you don't seem to understand that this is an emergency stop and should not ever be taken out, trades should be cut based on dynamic statistics as the trade progresses and the if the probabilities of each trade becomes a loser outweighs the probability of it becoming a winner, this can be down, with a combination of time and MAE/MFE, these concepts appear well beyond your intellect.), 90% of THOSE winning trades, didn't exceed 16 pips draw down. If you were to sett a 16 pip draw fixed SL, your win rate doesn't stay at ~90%, it drops, it's simple math, it drops on my figures to 81.87% You also failed to take into account, trading costs and commissions, in your 'sophisticated math'.  
  
I'm happy to go about my trading and keep trading this method and gathering the stats for individual pairs, and i'm happy to share my findings, i might even share my excel app when I'm done, it's no skin off my nose whether you believe me, trade this system or not. However, those who want help i'll happily help them understand it. I'm not selling anything, I'm not forcing you to trade this method. If you don't think it works, that's fine, move along, you're not welcome here.

You can help by posting examples of actual trades showing entries and exits and rational for cutting losses and stacking up winners and believe me that is not spoon feeding, that is how a trading system thread post should be administered. Without these the "stats" give very little comfort. 

Let it turn and find your entry.

Come on now. Don't be dense! I have written two dozen posts on why I put all the good, the bad and the ugly folks on Ignore so read up bro. I even have members who are now dead or left FF on my ignore list. What I am doing is more symbolic in nature....to show people where they belong and to stop spreading the hogwash nonsense. My actions are only driven by my own research based on process of elimination. Why the f*uck would I listen to idiots who are not aligned with my understanding of markets? I am openly advocating everyone to do what i am doing! This is the only way to get the nonsense clutter from our minds from what the factory has to offer. Pick one member who has the balls to put their own subscribers on ignore? That's me bro practicing what I preach. I am NOT here to please anyone or seek an army of subscribers nor am I here to get pleasure out of someone's misery of seeing repeat failures.  
  
I do realize putting everyone in one bucket is not fair so I am un-ignoring folks from my list too as and when appropriate. I can also tell who is emotionally stable in life just by seeing how they respond to my ignore action LOL  
  
You are a straight shooter and I like that about you. I think I put you on ignore at the same time I did to Neildigest. The shit talk about DavIT became too much for me to handle. Hate is just not a good place I want to me in.  
  
On the flip side, you have pounded your chest many times about your own success and yet there is no evidence. Get it now?

Noted, it is however difficult in 'real time' as often trades are in and out within a candle or two. (more often than not) I can post stuff in hindsight, but then the trolls are like 'oh that's easy' blah blah blah or that's it's photo-shopped, cherry picked, etc. Those people will continue to be added to the ignore.  
  
However i have another idea, I've got an indi called snapshot2.  
  
I'll throw it on my chart it auto takes a screen shots automatically every 5 minutes, i'll mark up some charts next week that of actual trades I've taken with rational for them. Hope this will help.

you claim that 90% of your 4 pip winners will not exceed a draw down of 15 pip.  
To me this information can be interrupt 2 ways :  
90% of your total trade would not exceed a 15 pip draw-down .  
90% of your winning trade does not exceed 15 pip draw-down.  
While the words winners hinted you were referring to the second option , the reason I assume it was the first is because telling us that 90% of your winners does not exceed 15 pip draw-down is very misleading as it made no mention of the total amount of trades taken.  
For example you can take 100 trades, win 50 and lose / cut the other 50 before they exceed 15 pip drawdown. ( which would most likely result in a net loss )  
I assume you were giving us relevant stats and therefore it would have to be options one as option two is missing key pieces of information that I would have to assume you intention left out if indeed you were referring to number two.  
I understand the method but you are constantly posting useless stats or stats with missing key element.  
Again If I am wrong tell me but this statement but the below statement is literally useless information as you made no mention of the total amount of trade taken if you were referring to option 2 :

My statement is crystal clear. I stated winners, not trades.

Then the information is very misleading as you made no mention of losers or the percentage of winning trades from total trades , so the entire statistic is literally useless can we agree on that?

There are decent local trade copiers of free, I set up a VPS with and MT4 with several windows11all with trade sender (which is also my trading terminal on my PC), then i set up my client terminals, log them into different accounts. As I trade on my home PC, the remote terminal sends the trades out within a couple of milliseconds and i'm loaded up. It has a bunch of other features as well, eg. Say i have $50 in my account, and $1000 in my trading terminals, it will auto lot size accordingly. 0.01 lots on my trading terminal would be 0.20 lots on my others.  
  
Exceptionally useful psychologically, IMHO. It just a bit fiddly to get going, but once it's running on a VPS with 100% uptime, and programs to restart the terminals if they crash or whatever, they almost always reflect each other in terms of $ give or take a small amount.

Yep..same reason why I rum my EA parallel in demo and live accounts. I rather fool around in demo if I get the itch to think I am smarter than the market :-)  
If I am not sure of my actions, I rather try my "what-if" scenarios in demo first....so I like my demo to mimic live in all aspects of RM/MM. It just helps with the "deer in the headlights" brain freeze moments.

I don't trust trade copiers for the same reason I don't trust VPS or compiled code with DLLs. Wondering if you have source code of such copiers in mq4 for me to create one of my own?

What sort of thing is possible with compiled code with DLLs? You mean it's possible for the program to upload your EAs or Indicators to back home?

As you can see from the above, I moved the TP's to the maximum, therefore instead of 12 pips for the 3 trades, I got 18.8.  
  
Making a total of 29.1 for the day so far.

Note, on the first pic (the one with three trades) i didnt mark it correctly. There should be three orange arrrows, Entry #3 was on the candle close of the last candle.

You can read this [link ](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11151967#post11151967)and what's possible with DLLs. Enabling DLLs in MT4 is like opening the door to your house and letting the developer do anything on your trading station. Problem is about trust and capability and many noobs are too quick to download and test freely available compiled code. The power of what could be accomplished with DLLs are limitless including what I pointed out in this link about a compiled EA sending your account information, name, email address, account balance etc to track the performance of this EA automatically from users directly to the developer without any disclaimer or transparency.  
  
Anyone who posts a compiled EA should go directly in your Ignore List. That is what I do!  
  
EDIT: And while you are at it, read [this ](https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=11156321#post11156321)as well before the Factory kick me out the door.

Very interesting. Is all of the communication between a malicious EA and DLL to back home, encrypted?

Not sure but encryption during transmission over the internet does not matter at all when you are knowingly or unknowingly letting someone come thru the front door to steal information from your computer. Look at myFXBook EA. Their EA asks for myFXBook login id and password .... in plain text. Now think about why is it designed that way? Why is that same user id and plain text password written to the MT4 Experts Log file? Your broker wants to know EVERYTHING because he is the counterparty offering the trading platform for noobs to make millions :-)

No the reason I ask if it's encrypted is because, if it isn't encrypted then someone with a packet sniffer could determine if their information is being stolen (since any data transferred would be in plain text). Therefore I assume any connection MetaTrader makes with the outside must be encrypted thereby making it very difficult for anyone to find out what information was or is being stolen.

Djhenry, thank you for your efforts posting part of your trades for today. As you have been trading this method for a while, can you please let us know what is your win rate using it? I saw your previous statistics regarding the draw down for the winning trades, but I don't think I saw anything regarding overall win rate. Thanks

Yes and then i opened a selltrade on EUR/USD and where just too set my sl and the mt4 froze so it spiked up before i got it running again and shaved half my account away so i need too deposit some more tomorrow and start a new explorer for my own sake not looking at thoose red numbers andit wasnt my systems fault that i lost...This is the 3 rd time it has happened too me and everytime i have lost 20-40 pips it never goes my way i am sure i am the most unlucky trader when it comes too things like this...So from now on i am going too trade 1 standard lot of my 600 dollars account will be tomorrow and only trade 3 pairs with lowest spread EUR/USD-USD/JPY and USD/CAD....i will go in hard with one pip stoploss so i really dont risk much around 1% i have put the tradingpanel back on because with that you can have a fixed sl at 2.5 pips and close it manually at 1 pip the 2.5 is fore if should freeze again but it wont with only 3 pairs i had 6 pairs until today ore if it spikes the loss is 2.5 % so it wont be a total bust as for today...Happy trading everyone...

Pal - I applaud and support you in asking folks for proof to back their statements made on forums. _**But**_ you got to give some kudos _and respect_ to Sis and others for having the nerve to put up their live TE. We simply cannot run out the forum yelling "where is your TE? Show us evidence" all the time and then throw shit at someone who does have to courage to put one up for everyone to assess. I (mentally) subscribe to everyone who has a TE (live or demo... even though I advocate against hooking live accounts). They are the true warriors imo to tackle this market with transparency and NOT the scumbags who simply post their chart setups and share stupid "simple to use" systems.  
  
I will say this repeatedly till my last breadth....one who shows us graciously how good his losing strategy is, is FAR FAR better than someone who is morally bankrupt and keeps fooling him/herself and others around him. It take a LOT of courage and will power to tell someone publicly "I still cannot figure out this beast".... and 99% are still in this phase, knowingly or unknowingly. 

Staying in my lane...

No you can't see my size (It's a 5 figure starting equity though). No you can't see my stops and targets. So for all the blind sheep who would like to follow, tough luck.

been more than 90 days and the money still aint talking bro. what happened to you ? a guess of mine.. i think you were bullshiting a lil since the beginning.Had the explorer not been asked, this thread will probably still be going. Sad thing is there a many of your types around here smh
