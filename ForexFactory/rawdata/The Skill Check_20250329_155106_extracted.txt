Welcome to the Skill Check Trading System. This system is very simple, easy to understand, and has numbers backing it. That being said, it’s all about testing your skill to see if you can make it work. Remember even if you are guaranteed a 10% edge, a majority of people will still lose money hand over fist. Technically, one could argue that this is half a system, but I digress. Now, let's get to the system. The thing we need to do is establish a pattern in the market that happens consistently that creates opportunity. This sounds like it will be very hard, but it’s not. There is essentially an endless amount of ways you can do this, but there is no reason to over complicate it so we will take one of the easiest ways I know how. And we will do it using a tool everyone is familiar with. That tool is a pivot point. Just the pivot. No other levels. In case you didn’t know, a pivot is essentially a 1 period Typical Price(HLC/3) MA shifted forward 1 period. What is really interesting is a pivot has roughly a 75% chance of being hit each period. This is regardless of the pair you are trading, or of what period you are drawing your pivots (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, 1 Minute, 5 Minute, etc). The hit rate varies from at least 70% and sometimes goes all the way to 80%+ but usually sits around 73-76%. This is our pattern that creates consistent opportunity in the market. It essentially creates opportunity every day, week, month, hour, etc). We can now create our trading rules. In this case , we are trading the traditional pivot that is drawn each day. If you are looking at weekly pivots, switch out day for week, etc. We can only enter a trade long if: Price is below the Pivot when the next day begins. Price has not yet touched the Pivot. We can only enter a trade short if: Price is above the Pivot when the next day begins. Price has not yet touched the Pivot. We can only exit a trade if: Price hits your take profit set at the pivot. Price hits your stop. The Skill Check: It's your job to figure out where to place your stops, how to manage/ trail them, and when to enter as long as the entry conditions above are met. REMEMBER: Pivots can be drawn using any period, you don’t need to stick to the daily period. You can use large or smaller periods. I will say, using smaller periods makes your trading much harder because your transaction costs will be very high relative to the trading opportunities created. I like the spread to be less than 10% of the opportunity created. If the spread is 3, I want to see a 30 pip opportunity or larger. Let’s say you like to trade using a 1:1 RR. The skill check is to see if you can capture an event that happens 75% of the time, at least 51%+ of the time using a 1:1 RR. Say you like to use a 1:2 RR. Then can you capture this move more than 33% of the time using those parameters? Remember it happens 75% of the time, so if you know how to time the market, it is very possible that you can capture it at least 34%+ of the time. Some will say it can’t be done, but it can. Many people trade pivots, and this is why some trade it profitably and others don’t. Some have the skill, some don’t. Now let’s talk about the rules of participating in this thread so we can keep this lively and more importantly, actionable around here. Rules of Participation: If you are posting trades/charts you MUST identify the following: The pivot level being traded (what period is it, and what pair are you trading). All pivot levels must be shown either with the tool provided, your own, or hand drawn. You do not need to share your entry/risk management methods beyond the rules shared on the first page. If you want though, feel free to. For those who think I am doing other traders a disservice by “concealing” rules, chances are, you will lose using other people's rules anyway (see study above). Everything involved with the skill check part of the system is open for discussion/development here. If you want to share entry/risk management ideas and build upon others, please do so. However, if you are sharing, it all must still incorporate the original rules outside the skill check. Provided Tools: Attached is an indicator I coded up for us. It’s simply a MTF pivot. You can set which period pivots you want to see and it will plot it on the chart. It will also plot the pivot hit probability if you’d like to display that as well. Attached File(s) SkillCheck.ex4 13 KB | 1,107 downloads I have also attached an image new traders will find useful. It essentially shows you the different win rates you need to break even depending on your RR Ratio. Attached Image More tools come... I posted this on a friday on purpose. For those who read it and find it interesting, you have a weekend to download the indicator, look at the charts think about how you can pass the skill the check. Come monday , I'll be posting all the weekly opportunities created and few of the daily ones that look interesting. For those who want to share their entry plan, feel free, for those who just want to share there trade after the fact, feel free. We are all looking at the same opportunities. What will separate the boys from the men is those who can pass the skill check, and those who can’t. Example Trade/First Chart: This is a trade I took this AM. Longed USDCHF with a 1:2 RR. Remember, price moves to the pivot like this 78.50% of the time. It’s very possible to capture that move with a 1:2 RR more than 33% of the time, that is, if you have any skill. Today was an easy day. If you bought anytime before the pivot was hit you would have made money with a 1:2 RR. Most days are not like this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Sys, I am interested in Pivot System, subscribed. thanks,

--- 帖子 #3 ---
This set of rules mixes up the hemispheres . It would make more sense to buy above the pivot and sell below it, no matter what the entry or exit rules were. (Here is one system from FF that employs this filter in particular). Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I think you may have misunderstood the rules or I wrote them incorrectly. It would be impossible to ever make a profit if you bought when price opened above the level and vice verse since you are ALWAYS targeting the level.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I understand the rules as laid out above. It is just in the nature of price to move away from any given level, which is why one should buy above and sell below any particular line. Your rules are going opposite to this. I suspect you’re not going to be able to do much progress with this set of rules. Even if you somehow will, I think you’d have it easier to do just the opposite. Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #6 ---
You are right. Using just the rules laid out without applying your own skill (ie the Skill Check) will result in lost money. This is not what I am suggesting people do.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
The only way out of this problem imho is to define a different, dynamic level above which one just buys and below it just sells. This could be for example, the daily vwap . Then to aim at the pivot (if it happens to be on the correct side of the vwap) with R:R 1:1 or something. This might work. k

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Those rules may pass the skill check. Only one way to find out, test em!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Not necessary: While my proposal might even work, I think it would be easy to construct a system that would be better. Consider a system that would completely ignore the pivot target, but would exit based on, say, MA cross. If this signal would coincide with a price bouncing from the pivot, it would basically do the same as the pivot-exit system (and if the price would move in stages up to the pivot, the MA system would perhaps make multiple entries, but would reach the same destination). However, if the price would revert before the pivot, and go straight back to the SL, the MA cross would have the trade exit early, with a small profit or small loss, instead of hitting the bigger sl, so it would cut losers faster. Finally, if the price would happen to break through the pivot and continue on, the MA system would earn more as it lets winners run . Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #10 ---
The skill check isn't about exits, it's all about entries. The entire point is to optimize entries around the opportunity created in order to make it profitable. This is the skill check. Can you make a profit on an event that happens 75% of the time.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Each round level gets around 4 visits on average when 2:1 RR is applied. For example 60 pips TP with -30 pips SL. Every round level gets around 4 SL hits. Some might get 12 SL hits, other just 1-2. That is how 4 SL hits gets formed. Pair does not matter. Same applicationis in useon all pairs... Pairs variety is delusional. Now, knowing this, can you make money? I know a trader here who makes good money out of the daily, weekly and monthly opening prices. But the guy is a pro. He works in the industry. I have never asked any questions, cause I did not want to answer any myself about my stuffs... It did not look simple to me. It is more than just a line...

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Just curious, when placing this on a 15 min chart and setting the timeframe to daily I get:: Attached Image (click to enlarge) , just curious if thats how its coded, where we can only go up x amount of time frames with the indicator?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
That usually means your lookback is set too high. If you only have access to the last 500 candles, a lookback of 1000 will give you the error. I'll make an update so you don't even have to bother setting a lookback period or anything like that.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
It's is definitely more than a line. If I had to guess, I would say that guy is able to trade that because he really understands how price typically distributes around that line.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for sharing Sis, How accurate these rates are ? on which pairs ? In the chart example (M1), which tf pivot were you using ?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The probabilities are accurate on all pairs, and all timeframes. Sometimes the 1 minute time frame numbers will skew a bit, but it’s impossibly to trade 1 minute pivots with any kind of spread. That was a daily pivot.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Another option would be a target based average-in since a) we know that the likelihood of not touching the pivot is approx. 0.25^(previously missed pivots+1), b) we know that the distance d to the next pivot is a function of the current high, low, close and the time to the end of the current candle If d is too small we close the trade rather than going for a progression.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Just enter @ open with tp @ pivot and exit @ close.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Why asking when you can just check by yourself? It took me less than 5 min: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note that the "hit rate" is very high because the open price is usually very close to the pivot like 5-10 pips on H1. If there is an edge from knowing this 75%+ it is perhaps not at all by targeting the pivot from the open. For instance buying S1 in up trend and setting a TP at or above the pivot because you know price is supposed to reach it with high probability. The question becomes: what is the conditional probability of the price hitting pivot given the trend is (estimated) up and the price is at S1?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Using pivots can be profitable, particularly where there are other confluence factors. Sis has come up with a set of rules and those interested in the rules should test them out. KP

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Good to see you back Sis, enjoyed you Fundamental trading thread. I am always fascinated by pivots, the strategy is similar to Davit's Pivot trading thread in terms of concept. I have installed the indicator but the weekly and monthly setting seems not to be working. Will keep an eye in here. Bravo

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Nice to have another verify what I am saying so people don't think I made the numbers up. Love a lot of your work around the forum too btw. You are correct. There is no edge with this in terms of just buying at the open right away and targeting the pivot. The spreads are too high, the opportunity at that point is too small and most of all, that would take no skill . There are a number of ways you can gain an edge though, it will just take some skill.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks Keen. To everyone else reading this: The entire point of my rules, is for people to build additional entries rules on top of them, to find the edge. If they want to share them here, they can, if not no biggie. But the point is, the Skill Check system, as posted, is incomplete. Each trader needs to make it their own by refining the entries with whatever tools they like. This is the skill check part. I already know a few different ways to abuse these pivots. However, I choose not to share them. I may share a few of the ways I don't trade anymore but until then, don't ask and don't expect anything.

Nice series of trades - are you using currency indices to give you clues about attractiveness of pair pivots ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
am in; will give it a try.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Tried to establish Pearson r between the pair and its components for every pivot period...hmm.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Are we looking at the Caramilla pivots?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
No, the standard ones - must have caught a strange data series, though, even the pivot reversion was &lt;70%.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Sorry to clog your thread, Sis, but pivots are statistically interesting: no matter what sample sets I choose (e.g. here I chose 22 bars or 22 min on a M1 chart), the pivot hit rate remains at approx. 75%. It reminds me of the scaling laws discovered by Richard Olsen a.o ( https://www.researchgate.net/publica...e_FX_coastline ).

--- 帖子 #35 ---
That is to be expected as the pivot calculation gives a large (1/3) weight to the Close value. If it gave this weight to the Open instead of the Close, I would expect a significantly lower hit rate percentage... k

--- 帖子 #36 ---
True - it dropped to about 60% at (H+L+O)/3.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Likely a better set of rules would be to enter in the (Close-Open) direction in the (25% of) cases when (H+L+C)/3 is not reached. SL could simply be at (H+L+O)/3. Stop and reverse when the entry condition is satisfied in the opposite direction. Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Keep sharing man. The whole point is to share unique ideas like this. I just wanted to lay a foundation for others to build off of.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi traders, Today I just discover your thread. Here I share my first trade with this pivot concept strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Following your steps. Let's see how can we build the system. Thank you man! TONI

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hmm, from my experience with subsequences I'd expect to see a win ratio of just 52 % for your suggestion.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes, I'd also expect trend trading with such mechanical entry to have at best ~50% win ratio. What counts is letting winners run and ideally adding to them. Cheers, k

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Following your comment I created a duration weighted pivot which yields a very high hit rate... e.g. for H1 the pivot calculation is as follows: t(H)=M1 bars since High(1,H1) t(L)=M1 bars since Low(1,H1) t(Total)=t(H)+t(L)+1 P = High(1,H1) x t(H)/t(Total) + Low(1,H1) x t(L)/t(Total) + Close(1,H1) x 1/t(Total)

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Very nice work here man. Becarefully trading moves this small though on high spread pairs. It will make it almost impossible to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I USE PIVOT ONLY FOR TAKE SETUP OP AND PROJECTION Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
it would be great for doing ITM/ATM options at Nadex where high probability is the name of the game instead of pips traveled.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Another weighting I tried is Phi-based Recency Bias, i.e. if the High has happened first (=further in the past), it is multiplied with 0.382 and the Low with 0.618 (and vice versa). Again, the result yields approx. 75% hit rate :-)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Pivot width and range width need to be accounted for, in my experience. Big range days yield wide pivots and vice versa. So on wide days the odds of a central pivot getting hit go down resulting in missed pivots. Missed pivots is a great little strategy if you do it intelligently. However, I've also found that there are missed pivots where price might not reach the pivot, but falls within the central pivot range. (Where the central pivot range is a range around the central based on the width of the calculated period.) Case in point is the USDCAD earlier last week. http://content.screencast.com/users/...0Mar.%2003.gif The yellow box highlights the area in question. The previous day was decent trending day with a wide range. The blue line is the central pivot which price opened above and didn't move to the pivot line resulting in a missed pivot. However, because the prior day was wide it meant the central pivot would have have required a decent amount of retrace to hit before the trend continued. Using the central pivot range calculation, price nailed the TC line and took off. So was that a true missed pivot? The following day's pivots were wide due to another trending wide range and price didn't even retrace to the TC line thus that area could be considered a true missed pivot area. Just something to consider and some additional lines to watch if using the central pivot as a major decision/target area. You can read more about pivot range analysis here: http://pivotboss.com/2010/05/31/a-qu...e-pivot-range/ Missed pivots here: http://robbooker.com/how-to-predict-a-market-turn/ Missed pivots indicator here: http://tfl365.com/trifecta/missed-pivots-download/

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Why not just processing some stats. The most simple idea I can think about is to record 2 things, the distance from the open of a new D1 candle to the pivot, and if prize hit the pivot point within the day. Now we can calculate the probability how often the pivot point has been hit given the distance. But that's just the beginning and won't help in cases where strong up/dn movements occur during the day. Helpful could be in addition the distance prize can travel in the opposite direction before it goes to the pivot point, and the time of the first pivot point hit. And maybe the probability of a hit after x days haven't hit.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Do it, and do it, and do it, and do it, until the job gets done.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Don't have time. I'm working on similar stuff without pivots recently ... Just brainstorming

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sticking with the daily pivot calculation based on Phi (see post#46), I ran the indicator through 2122 days to again achieve 74% hit rate. I further added a frequency distribution of subsequent pivots missed before the actual hit, see upper right corner [missed pivots|%] in the attachment: you can draw your own conclusion.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I went back in history to find the above recorded 5 subsequent pivots misses: the trade direction changed after the first.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
The distributions of subsequently missed pivots are really interesting... Thinking of a couple different things we could do with this...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Me too - you first...:-)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Maybe you can add further stats showing the probability P(x|x-1) that x failures occur after x-1 failures have been already realized. That way we can further see if the non-hitting events are independent or more probable after realized failures ("clustered").

... Ignored Like some billy bar stats eh? I've gathered my own on some of the stuff you do and the numbers are great, however, I still can't figure out how you manage the draws on those few tough days. Also, your girl claudia is who put me on the pivots probably like 4-5 years ago.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i remember Claudia speaking about you.. as for draw down.. i have favourite Nos best one being 28. and for the 15 minute time frame 15/20 is good . THEN I COUNTER, it also helps having a bank roll to muscle the trades..

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Okay, I see, so once it's that max area, you flip it with a hedge? Is that what you mean when you say counter?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
This could perhaps be a reasonable mean-reversion approach -&gt; trading towards a pivot. k

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Yeah, you'd probably want to make sure the instrument with the lowest 14 day ADR, is also low relative to its self if that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes, i agree with the argument that it still loses, so you can actually just use a stop BUT when i have a fail i then adjust my lot size (sometimes) and my FD changes so i make more than 5%. My target for the 08-00 break is 10 but i look for 5. edit, i have a fail (1st part) and i can then chase Daily Range for example.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
So that's when you bring out some muscle from the bankroll so the next break opportunity covers the loss (not saying a martingale, just using some muscle like you said).

--- 帖子 #65 ---
i do adjust my lot size sometimes, it is all stat related and you are correct it isnt martingale related. What i also do and this is very debatable . Sometimes i make more than 5% and this extra is used to offset a loss. as long as i have 25 % at the end of the week (ok sometimes not) it doesn't matter if i were 40% up as long as i get the 25%. it is classed as a casualty or a loss leader.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
AND i use 2 bank rolls, a small one and a bigger one. (long story) don't ask lol. and bank roll i only use a fraction.... i play stats

--- 帖子 #67 ---
You guys at the edge and found something but probability will be changed as much as more people starts using it... Processed data is there so for the trained minds already have good ideas to see how to trade this

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi, i am continually updating stats, day in day out. running back years shows stats and they can be compared against recent stats. Frequency Distribution cannot be argued against I agree with what you say, BUT probability will/can be changed??? it could well change and does, but it shows up in frequency distribution.. Trade well bud, good post edit, i only play around with small lots now so i have something to talk about in here, BUT now contradicting myself, i am trading for my girl friend full lots. she was hoping for 6% return per annum but its currently running at +33% lol.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Sis anyone trading atm still 100 pips on the table on the Dax at 69 per cent hit rate cheers Eamonn.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
it has been a bit quiet in here.. Has anyone any stats of the DP being met and then breakthrough or retrace to the S1 or R1.. i am having difficulty setting my Pc to work it out. thanks

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I finally got to correct the stats for # and % of missed daily pivots plus I also added the pip distances from open price of first bar to a) the pivot, if it was hit, and b) the open price of the first bar of the subsequent period, if it was missed. Obviously, opening and closing trades at the first bar, doesn't seem to be a profitable strategy in the long run. Using indicators or S[1-3]/R[1-3] levels to enter at max excursion from pivot levels would undoubtedly bring down the hit rate, but possibly improve the winning:losing pips ratio. However, the more interesting strategy to look at would be to add 1 more order on top of the first missed entry (i.e. 1 martingale order to yield profit at the latest pivot level), as long as the distances between the two orders are somewhat meaningful - thereby combining the 76%+16% probabilities. If 2 levels are missed, we'd close the orders. I'll run the simulations another day. Btw: This time I used the traditional pivot calculation of (H+L+C)/3. My studies across all timeframes and period starting points suggest that there is no magical or market clearing pivot level, other than a logical correlation between recency bias of the pivot point calculation and the pivot hit rate itself - i.e. the more recency bias the higher the hit rate...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I ran tests over 630 days to see if there is a significant difference for the profitability (for trading logic see see previous post) with regards to the starting hour of the daily pivot calculation. There isn't really. In fact, only two hours turned out to be profitable: 10 AM Tokyo by about 400 pips of 6,600 range, and 6 AM London by about 120 pips of 6,200 range. The others were hovering between 400-200 pips in the negative over the same range.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Interesting observation over 18 years of EURUSD data: there has never been a higher missing daily pivot streak than 4. With the right initial risk and bankroll that should yield a positive strategy...

--- 帖子 #74 ---
How often did those 4-streaks occur? And when did they occure. If they are clustered there may be an obvious reason for this occurance. Would be interested to see your stats. Thx in advance!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
4 missed: 2 times; 24.-30.12.2007 and 22.-27.9.2017 3 missed: 39 times 2 missed: 183 times 1 missed: 950 times Hits: 5,077 times

--- 帖子 #76 ---
USD CHF is short now @ 0.9510 and closing 0.9430

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The stats are quite striking: I will try to find a pivot point calculation (i.e. degree of recency bias) that maximizes the distance to the pivot point while maintaining similar hit rates.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hello !iii! could you explain with more details please , i need to admit i tried so few days to understand , but i fail to understand the concept Thanks in advance SB

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The "problem" is the proximity of the daily open prices to the pivot level, which doesn't give much "room" to work with: 5% &lt;= 1.4 pips 10% &lt;= 2.7 pips 15% &lt;= 4.1 pips 20% &lt;= 5.7 pips 25% &lt;= 7.0 pips ... 50% &lt;= 14.7 pips

--- 帖子 #80 ---
ok i see it clear now thanks

--- 帖子 #81 ---
You could calculate the pivot for each new M1 candle. For instance, at midnight you calculate the pivot based on the OHLC of the recently closed day. At 00:01 you use the close of the M1 candle as well as the highest high and lowest low of the range from 00:01 of previous day to 00:01 of the current day, etc. This way you may have much more trading opportunities and thus you could just wait for the pivot points with a relatively high distance. However, the problem here is that many consecutive pivot points may not be hit.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Now we're talking

--- 帖子 #83 ---
This is how the proximity of open prices to the continuous daily pivot looks, when using a H1 resolution - just like any other oscillator. As expected, the hit rate remains high, but so do the consecutive misses (I saw streaks of 24 misses on 1,000 trades). Even if we enter only upon certain thresholds, I can't see, how the pivot stats with the high hit rates help us now.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Sticking with the calculation of continuous pivot levels, I simulated opening trades a) from the open price towards Pivot, no hard SL (i.e. every bar), and b) from sigma 1 and 2 excursion levels, but with additional filters being Reward-to-risk at 2 (i.e. Distance to Pivot = 2 x SL) Open price to SL &gt;= 5 pips, and The period high or low having happened before the actual open price -&gt; i.e. the open price has a floor / ceiling and closing trades at the Pivot (=profit), SL or with expiry after 1 day (=loss). The hit rates dropped significantly from a) to b), and, unless I have a bug somewhere, the profit:loss stats didn't suggest a statistical edge, either. I used 10,000 bars and with every sigma trades dropped tenfold and hit rates halved.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I really like how you are visualizing the distance with the rolling pivots. Creates a very interesting histogram. I think it does so poorly because the stops are super close. I'd try using a stop that is the same length as your target or 2 times greater than the distance to the target. Also, I'd be interested to see the basic pivot hit rates from each sigma level using no stops.

Since the true range differs significantly between the hours of the day, the calculation of sigma could be based on just all values of the same hour. However, I don't think that it will change the overall picture ...

Could you please explain what this shows exactly? Looks promising

It didn't...

...however, going with periodic sigmas only halved (instead of dropping tenfold) the opportunities per excursion level while the hit rates remained above 50%.

For now it shows, that Pivot levels remain a Fata Morgana.

Given the proximity to the pivot level for 50% of all hits being the main challenge to recover floating losses from previously missed pivot levels, one could try an Anti-Martingale approach: instead of focusing on trending streaks for double downs - i.e. the period of consecutively missed pivots -, we do a double up when a pivot is hit or when the hit was particularly small. Or we do it randomly. Any ideas are welcome.

FYI - I ran several 100 simulations using random double ups across 10,000 samples, but the profitability didn't change significantly (+-3%).

My code about the period congruent (i.e. only all first, second,..., 24th hour) sigma had a bug. I corrected that and, not unexpected, the sigma converges for a large number of samples. Nevertheless, it doesn't have any unknown impact on the Pivot stats.

Following the idea of a fellow FF member for pivots to better work in ranging environment, I used the period congruent ranges (i.e. rolling daily H-L) as a filter for entries towards rolling daily pivots. The range detecting logic was to enter as long as sigma &lt;=1.5, and the trend one was to enter for sigma &gt;= 1.5. For the first approach, the loss stats improved by 50% vis-a-vis non-filtered entries with even higher hit ratios supporting the theory. For the latter, they stayed more or less the same. Initially, I wasn't sure if I had the correct sigma's, since the current calculations suggest very long tails...

Hi selecting weekly pivot I got this error 2018.05.14 00:33:12.470 SkillCheck EURUSD,H1: array out of range in 'SkillCheck.mq4' (102,43) could You check or release the .mq4 file? Thanks

Bad settings. I believe you don't have enough history, as Sis Already stated before.

This thread has been around for a while now. I wonder how many people have actually made use of this information to create a meaningful strategy. Something so simple yet overlooked by many, maybe because "conventional wisdom" states that anything above the pivot point = buy and anything below the pivot point = sell. I stumbled upon this thread and took an interest, and decided to give it a whirl to see if something good comes out of it. I'm using the thread starter's original rules of trading towards the pivot point, using a primarily trend-following strategy, with TP at the pivot point. Haven't tested all pairs, but it seems to do ok for EURUSD and AUDJPY. There seems to be a lot of potential for this, and at least the initial tests are promising, with win rates &gt; 80%. I'm not sure if anyone is still looking at this or has created something meaningful, but I'm happy to have a discussion about this either via this thread or privately. I've attached some screenshots of the initial tests with EU and AJ. Results are combined.

The rules as stated by the thread starter would work well in pairs that range most time like EURUSD, USDCHF, CHFJPY. If one put little discretion into it, pivot remains a very simple but powerful tool for trading profitably, especially intraday

If only it was that simple. The truth is that the 25% of the time when the pivot points aren't reached would kill you. Don't take my word for it. Try it out.
