Looks like Eagle is on a great roll. Can you tell us the specifics on the system my friend? I wish you the best!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi eagle , Looks like an interesting breakout system! As I see you only take 3 candles to define a breakout box. Are there more details, cause it sure looks interesting! Happy trading!

eagle, i think you found a very good breakout strategy here... going to back test and forward test. The indicator is also fantastic

--- 帖子 #14 ---
It´s a nice idea, and thamk you for sharing your indicator. Eagle , how would you handle the breakout of GBP USD in the middle ???? ( Look at the arrow ) Do you put a stop loss of 20 or 30 pips, or what are you doing in this case ? ( I´m an italian fan and in holidays in August I´m every year in Italy, since 20 years already. I love italy !!!!! ( Camping near Jesolo)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for the indicators, eagle ! Definitely going to do some fwd-bck-testing Cheers for Italy

Here is how my setup looks like http://i13.tinypic.com/6fzz8kx.gif Changed the parameter for box validity to 19:00, because I usually don't trade later than 21:00 GMT+2

--- 帖子 #19 ---
So according to your code, the spread goes in the BoxBreakout_Offset variable, right? If so, why not make it automatic using a formula like BoxBreakout_Offset =( Ask - Bid ) / Point; BTW this s a very nice indicator I like the coding... Great stuff. Thanks for sharing it.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Is the breakout time 5 to 8 am your time or GMT?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks so much for sharing this with everyone! Can anyone see the box breakout color on their charts? BTW: I love Italy so much. The people, the country, and of course... the food! Wonderful! Have a GREAT WEEK! FXS

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Nope... Box Breakout color seems to be invisible...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Wow, look like a great breakout system for me...going to try this next week! Thanks man!!!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Looks good man. Many Thanks. Also, as howard asked, is 5-8 in GMT time?? Im using interbankfx demo. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Also, where do you put the stoploss? Is it the other side of the breakout box?? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I'm sorry, but could any one tell me how to use the indicator? Please give me example... Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #27 ---
whats the difference from Hans breakout? different in timing?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Yes, The use of indicator is as follows: 1. Indicator draws a box capturing the high and low of the price for the given time frame and number of candles. Particulary this indicator monitors high and low from 5am to 8am. 2. Indicator draws a box, keeping those high and low in memory for the rest of the day or given time period (for this example it's 23:00 or 11PM). When price breaks out of the given high or low, you accordingly must buy or sell depending on which side of the box was penetrated (high or low). If there are more questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I'm always ready to help

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Is 5-8 Am GMT? If not which broker's time are you using? Thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Greetings, Very interesting strategy. Can anyone advise me on this strategy. I have not seen an outline of this strategy anywhere on this forum. I would appreciate any assistance. Also, what are the best currency pairs to use with this method and the best timeframe. Thank you. Regards, forexnetworth

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks a lot Dexis..., Now, it's much easier read this indicator, well... Just one question left. The time zone, is it GMT? Great indicator, Thank you very much Eagle...

--- 帖子 #32 ---

I stopped beleiving in breakout systems like these after I saw Hans123 system performance for this year. It worked for over 3? years, and now its a pity it stopped since the beginning of this year.

If I understood the rules correctly, buy or sell if the price goes thru the box with 15 pips stoploss, then I have some bad news. see pic

--- 帖子 #41 ---
YOU TO HAVE EARNED 10PIPS AND NOT TO NEED STOP LOSS POSITION CLOSE!!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
what do you use for stop loss settings eagle?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I took the liberty of making a option to have the indicator determine the spread automatically. Just set AutoAddSpread to true. Thanks again eagle, I hope you do not mind this option added... To run it just as yours, leave AutoAddSpread false.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Wow, Scott, excellent modification! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
As I understand You use 15 stoploss quote:"Would Put One Loss Of Arrest Of 15 Pips . " post#17 this is what I see:

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Maybe eagle had in mind putting StopLoss to breakeven after +15 pips gain?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I think there is some more details which eagle havent tell us... But from what i see the first trade of the day is always on the winning side... Maybe 1 day 1 trade? or maybe after a trade on long we wait for a trade on short??? anyway this system like good to me! Thanks

--- 帖子 #48 ---
any rules on how to actually put in a trade? do you wait for a candle to close or put in a buy stop a few pips above the highlow of the breakout? thanks.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
example: high breakout gbp/usd 2,0330 entry. t/profit 2,0340+SPREAD=2,0343 S/LOSS 2,0315 LOW BREAKOUT GBP/USD 2,0307 ENTRY. T/PROFIT 2,0297-SPREAD= 2,0295 S/LOSS 2,0322

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Very interesting thread, i have been forward testing a strategy very similar to this, but varied as follows: 1. High and low is only one hour, that being 3pm-4pm Sydney, Australia time. I won't say what that is in other time zones because its fairly important to get it right. 2. If it breaks high, then enter long 1 pip above high. Vice versa for short obviously. 3. Target 10 pips. But if target not reached, S&amp;R other side of range. Example. High = 2.0334 Low = 2.0325 Breaks high, buy @ 2.0335, target at 2.0345 S&amp;R short @ 2.0324, BUT with a bigger lot size, so that when you get to 2.0314, you have made the same amount of money as your original long would've made, its slightly martingale, but due to the market at this time this is kept to a minimum because London markets are opening and volatility is almost certain. The idea of my variation on this is to always have the TP as 10 pips either side of the range. Its working well for me.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I may be overstepping the mark here and slightly high-jacking this thread, if thats the case and the moderators want a new thread out of this, i'll happily comply, i was going to start one anyways. Up to the big guys upstairs...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
What pairs are you considering? Or just the cable only?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Good job eagle could any one help me with the timming in EST? and we get the high and low for the candles from 5:00 to 8:00 so the high and low of 8:00 candle included or not? regards

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Sorry, i should've mentioned i only do this on the cable. Because it displays fairly consistent characteristics at this point in the day.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Could you help me i need the timing of the candles in EST? Regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Blackinc, from Qld perhaps, I'm based in Brisbane. How do you set the setting on your metatrader thanks. Thanks Eagle for the indicator.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Set your parameter of "periodBegin" = 0:00am midnight and "periodEnd" = 03:00am, which correspond to BreakOut-EAGLE local time setting. Hope this help

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi, what to double check the time... periodBegin= London market open time or 3 hours before London market open? Thanks

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Eagle, good simple method you have here.Could you please confirm that your stop loss is 15 pips and you target is 10 pips+ spread. Also do you enter on the break of the box not bar closing outside of the box. How long have you been trading this method? and do you know how many pips per week,per month you make with the method. With Many Thanks David-T

--- 帖子 #61 ---
15 pip stop may work for GBP/USD but on the GBP/JPY 15 pips is way to low in my opinion. Need to backtest and see.

--- 帖子 #62 ---

Hello FX friends, I have back tested this system and I've noticed that with the box from 5am-8am GMT and SL 15 of pips this is hit several times, instead if we move the box to 6am-9am GMT we can hit the target before the SL. I have simulate this on the past week. Altought, it seems to be a great indicator for the GPB/USD on the london market opening. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
This looks alot like the AHAL method on tsd. The AHAL method suffered MASSIVE drawdown in May but before this some people had got quite excited and jumped into live trading too quickly with probably bad MM and were burned. Just a heads up.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hey Eagle! Thanks for a good system. So let me repet basics....hope i got them: - GMT+1 time from 5.00 to 8.00 (Italy,Slovenia,Croatia...) - highs and lows of that 3 bars - when broken enter with TP 10+spread with SL 15 I do really not know why it works but it does..... Question: does bar has to be closed outside of zone or just brake of the 3bar high?

Great system, Eagle... Could someone PLEASE confirm whether entry is at the BREAK of the h/l or at the CLOSE of a candle above or below? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #80 ---
As for my understanding entry point is just after the break of the box not after the candle is closed above or below it. Buy stops and sell stops may help here.

--- 帖子 #81 ---

Hello to all, That spike that broke the box was a result of fundamentals, the UK CPI announcement that was 2.4 vs 2.5 previous. This could mean that inflation is not really slowing as it is still going strong, and there will be a good reason for the UK to hike the rate to 6%.

--- 帖子 #92 ---

Hi eagle Are you using 6 to 9 breakout from now on?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
No, i think he still stick to his system....5 to 8... Thanks

--- 帖子 #100 ---
First of all, a very big THANK YOU to Eagle!!!! It was very kind of you to share the indicator. It works well with the small change of time (6 to 9) and it is great for GBP based pairs (although the spread for the GBP/JPY can be 9 pips at some brokers, which makes that pair hard). Secondly, for us poor souls who live in EST (of the USA) and who must trade like vampires in the night.... I use "alertfx.com" to set alerts when price hits the break out points (or near them). The messages go to my phone via SMS and I created a loud noice that wakes me up. And best of all.....it is free! I hope this helps. Again....thanks to all who have such great ideas on this thread. It blows me away to see a community of positive people who try to help each other. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
do you use buy and sell stops above and below the zone? how do you enter the trade?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Great Thread, I was thinking that is someone is adding an audible alarm would be a great idea to add an email alarm too. Adding an email can be use to send a SMS to a mobile by using some site services. Most of the breaks occurs at 3AM for me. Thx

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Maybe this system can be used for other currencies, but on the market opening of at least one currency of the cross. I will do some back testing when I have time to check this.

Hi Eagle do you use a 15 pip stop or not? also my MT4 server is set to central europe time so what time should the breakout box be set to, i have idea but it needs to be confirmed 06:00-09:00 or 7:00-10:00 is that right or not.Somebody please confirm what we should be using. With Many Thanks David-T

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I read the thread and could never figure out the actual time parameters of the box. I matched up Eagle's charts with GMT time and this is what I found- He's running his box from 0400 GMT until 0700 GMT. As far as what is considered a breakout- I still don't know. Is it 1 pip above/below the box? If so, the spread needs to be added to the long entry.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I to use minilott and not to use stop loss . to be able you to use the min or max of the previous candle .

--- 帖子 #117 ---
eur/usd +13 ... usd/chf +13 ... aud/usd +12 ... usd/cad +13 ... total today = 76 pips

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Yes, 0400 GMT until 0700 GMT. Eagle is from Italy and the time is GMT +1 for the country so 0500 - 0800 GMT+1 or 0400 - 0700 GMT. As for breakout - enter when price breaks the box, at least in 1 pips.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Very nice, eagle! Thanks for sharing..will be watching this technique more closely! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Eagle, My Italian isn't perfect, but I do speak a little bit of the language. If you need any help with anything feel free to ask. Mio italiano non è perfetto, ma parlo un po della lingua. Se hai bisogno d'aiuto con qualche cosa, puoi chiedere.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Eagle Great system, seems to work quite well on gbpusd. I also find that the time setting for GMT is 4am to 7am. Nice work I love Pizza's Regards

--- 帖子 #122 ---
So then the NYC time is ACTUALLY 11pm to 2am??? In other words, the indicator STOPS measuring the range at 3am (London open)? I had it set from 12am to 3am, so the indicator didn't stop price measurment until 4am....

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Eagle, Could you give us a list of the pairs that you trade? I know from the past posts that you trade: AUD/USD EUR/GBP EUR/USD GBP/USD USD/CAD USD/CHF USD/JPY Are there any other currencies which you trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #124 ---
It's confusing. It always is when time is given in anything other than plain unadulterated GMT. On an hourly chart, the indicator draws the box ONE bar to the left of the actual bar that begins the measurement. It draws it at 0400 GMT. The first bar that is being measured starts at 0500 GMT. The last bar that is measured ends a 07:59:59 GMT. Again, the box will be one bar wider than the actual measurement window. After piecing everything together, I believe this is correct.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Eagle, I don't see any winning breakout on my 1H chart of AUD/USD. I am at GMT+1 like you. Could you clarify this please? Do you use any other indicatiors? Or are you using any other time frame like Daily of 4H?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Make sure your indicator is setup for the correct time parameters... AUD?USD is a very clear short for over 20 pips today....

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi guys, just wanted to know how u guys entered the trades. Do you wake up and watch the trade or do you place buy/sell stops? Also, isnt meta trader on GMT time? If so won't u just have to place the indicator in and use the same settings? The only change should be when this occurs in your local time as far I as I am aware.

JOB ON ALL THE CURRENCIES THAT TO HAVE SEEN WITH SMALL LOTTERIES 0,02 AND NOT USE STOP LOSS. YOU TO BE ABLE TO USE the S/L WITH the CANDLE BEFORE To 1H

--- 帖子 #133 ---
It depends on the broker what times are shown on the MT4 charts. The only one I know that uses GMT time is IBFX.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
ahh thank you. what about the issue of entry. buy/sell stops? enter the market manually? thanks.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
At the 3am EST bar, (London open) it opened at 8777, low was 8753.. Bottom of the box was at 8771.... easy 15 pips... Remember, you should have your box so it STOPS measuring at the London open...

--- 帖子 #136 ---
[quote=eagle;1499259]JOB ON ALL THE CURRENCIES THAT TO HAVE SEEN WITH SMALL LOTTERIES 0,02 AND NOT USE STOP LOSS. I mean no disrespect to Eagle who is doing a GREAT job... but can someone please explain to me what the above sentence means? (small lotteries 0,02???)

--- 帖子 #137 ---
[quote=audionut;1499284] I think Eegle means that he trade all pairs with mini lots of 0,02 without any stop loss. Eagle will correct me if I am wrong...

CIAO,SAI COME IMPOSTARE GLI ALERT E-MAIL PER INDICATORI? GRAZIE EAGLES HELLO, TO KNOW LIKE SETTING UP ALERT EMAIL FOR THE INDICATORS? THANKS EAGLE

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Did you know that you can set alerts within MT4? To do this, 1 click on the Alert Tab in the Terminal window. 2 Right click in the window white space 3 select Create 4 Follow the instructions to set up the alert 5 Make sure your email is enabled in the Tools tab (at the top of the screen) and then the Options tab and then the E-Mail Tab. You can have either a sound alert or a visual alert or a Email alert, or any combination of them...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Eagle.... Here is how "Alertfx.com" works: Go to the site and sign up as a user. Then you will have the ability to create alerts and they can then be delivered to either your email or phone (via sms) when price hits the target. Example: I live on in EST of the USA, so after the box is created I see where the breakout is going to happen for both the possible "long" and "short" areas. Then, I create 2 alerts (one for short and one for long) that send an SMS to my mobile phone when they are reached. Then I get to the computer and watch what happens. I suppose that you can either do this or just set "pending" buy and sell orders. I like to see what is happening and I prefer to set alerts. OK, lastly.....am I the only one confused about time???? I feel very stupid and I think that I messed up my "inputs". Is this correct? IF your MT4 platform (and broker) use GMT, then just leave the times alone and they will be correct. If local time is being used by the broker, then make the adjustment to GMT time in the "input" section of the indictor so that they correspond to the correct settings (5 to 8 GMT) or (6 to 9 GMT)??? Also...have we come up with an agreed setting? (5 to 8 GMT) or (6 to 9 GMT)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi, I´m not sure if we all undestand the great addition that an Automatic email alert will do. For us leaving in America the box draws somewhen from 11pm and 2AM which means we are getting some sleep. Unfotunately we would have to wait until 2am for the box be formed to be able to set an email alarm. The idea would be that the email is sent once the box is formed and broken in either direction. The user info to where and how the email is sent is defined under Tools, Options, Email. If seen indicator that do this. Here is one. The line that actually send the email reads like... if(EMail_Alert) SendMail("MACD Colored Alert",TimeToStr(TimeLocal(),TIME_DATE|TIME_SECONDS)+" : "+alertmsg); Print(alertmsg); I do not know how and where to insert the code. Maybe someone with programing experience could help us. I attached the full indicator code. Reynold

Ciao Eagle Would it be possible for you to create the same indicator for MT4 but for Tokyo market opening.? I think that this could be very nice to use with JPY pairs like EUR/JPY and USD/JPY.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Sorry to keep bringing up this subject, but I have read several versions of times to use with the indicator. The original plan posted by Eagle was 5 to 8 GMT, then it was changed to 6 to 9 GMT, and finally I saw that 4 to 7 GMT. I did a comparison of the three and it is my opinion that 04:00 to 07:00 GMT gave good results (with least amount of false signals). It seems logical being that it reflects activity immediately before the start of the London session. May I ask for your comments? If we all use the same inputs and verify the results then we can say if this really is a winning system or if the past few months have been "luck". Thanks

--- 帖子 #147 ---
This is what eagle is using now 4 to 7 GMT, but I guess that for him it is 6-9 he is at Italy with GMT+2 (if you have any doubts http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=215 ). I was checking also and its the timeframe with better results. I'm now checking a better timeframe for JPY pairs, if someone can help

Exactly so GMT+2. Normally Italy as GMT+1, but in the summer they have GMT+2. GMT time http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ Italy Actual Time - http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/tim...n-union/italy/ I hope that this issue is clear for everyone now

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Guys- this time thing is the biggest mess I've ever seen. If you'll check Eagles charts against your own charts, you'll see he starts his count at the bar that begins at 0500 GMT and ends it at the bar that ends at 0800 GMT. That is 9AM London time and is not the opening of the London market. The bar he starts monitoring is the bar to the right of the left hand margin of his box. Another poster pegged it at 0300 EST and New York isn't even on EST- Its EDT during the Summer. Eagle- Let's do this. Tell us the name of your broker. Tell us exactly what you have as inputs to your indicator for periodbegin periodend boxend I'll find out the time standard used by the broker and we can figure it out from there. Also, the fact he is located in Italy doesn't matter concerning his chart times. What determines the chart times is the MT4 providing broker.

I wrote a EA for a system that was similar to this one a year ago. I can modify it and post here if anyone wants it, so it will run under these rules... The thing is, I do not want to maintain it, nor do I want to answer a bunch of questions about how do I load and use an EA. I would be happy to upload the source code and anyone is welcome to modify it or change it as they see fit. If I were you I would still use the indicator by eagle for the graphics, because this Ea does not have graphics it just places the trades at the correct time. Does anyone want me to post it?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Checking Eagles chart above with my own.....OK.. yes indeed, I can confirm Eagles charts STOP the measurement 1 hour after London open... OR 4am EDT. Just make sure your settings reflect this and your all set.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
In that case he could not have made 12 pips on the AUD/USD this morning. Put that box on that pair and look at it. UNLESS- He is using different time parameters for different pairs.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Exactly So candle one starts at 4GMT candle two at 5GMT candle tree at 6GMT and candle four starts at 7GMT (8am GMT+1 London market open) and closes one hour after the market open.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
You are right, he could have done only 10 pips without spread. Yes, It is possible. Eagle show us your AUD/USD box

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Mt4 brokers do not report uniform pricing. He could have easily had a larger range than your or my chart had ... We are only talking about a couple of pips... It happens all the time...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Not that much. With my spread I could only have made 6 pips if I had traded at that time. I checked two different platforms- IBFX and FXDD.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Yes, but he only measures three candles. The box encloses four candles. The first candle to the left is not measured.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thank you. I was not aware of that.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Eagle- You show a 12 pip range from the bottom of the box to the low of the next candle. I show 10. That's understandable, but to have exited at that next candle low you had to sacrifice the spread. Mine is 5 pips on that pair. Yours must be close to that. I only see about 6 or 7 pips profit. Actually I see a stop out. Your profit target could not have been hit if it was 10 pips + spread.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes the way I see it you use the 3 hours before the market you are trading open with the last candle one hour before open. So for London open you use 4am to 7am while the market open at 8am. I think a simmilar argument will apply for other markets, adjust you time according to the open of the market you trade. Regards

--- 帖子 #167 ---
He entered 2 pips before the bottom of the box Mine is 3 pips on that pair and on several others

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Yeah, I noticed that he did. I didn't mention that.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
That's what I understood that Eagle was doing, but that's not what he's doing. He stops his Hi/Lo measurement one hour after the London open.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
:surprised

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes would you please post it? Thanks. Richard

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Ok, I will upload it. You guys can do with it what ever you want.. If AutoMoney Management is true, It will determine the lot size for you based on the Percent To Risk. Formula is Account Balance * Percent to risk / Stop loss/ 10 If it is false, the Lots determines the lot size. default is .10 lots the Cancel Hour is the time you want all trades to cancel. The EndHour is the hour that you want to stop measuring. LookBack is how many bars to lookback default is three. That pretty much is it. The source code is well documented so as to see what is going on and where... Have fun. Oh yeah, I forgot, Disclaimer... Trade at your own risk. I make no warranties as to fitness for any purpose. The close all trades portion I got from a script that is circulating and I liked the code, but wanted to state I did not originate that part. Nice coding wish I had LOL

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I won't belabor it anymore. but that still wouldn't have hit your profit target. You showed a 12 pip range from the bottom of the box (actually above the bottom). If you sold at 1 pip below the box that gave you an 11 pip movement to the low that followed. Your system states to use a profit target of 10 pips + spread. That would have been a PT of 12 pips. To reach that, price had to fall 14 pips, including the difference between the bid and ask prices.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
The system DOES look to be a little more profitable with the last candle measured being the one BEFORE the London open.... Interesting... Maybe I'll do some backtesting tonite to see if this is true...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I agree with the statement that 04:00 to 07:00 GMT seems like the better play. I also agree that you should use the same process to trade other sessions. Thanks for all the input. This is really a very simple plan and I can not believe that it could work...but it seems to do the trick. I guess that sometimes simple is better. Now, if the time issue were not so confusing . I will test several pairs during the next London session using the 4 to 7 GMT inputs and report back when the session is over.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Kind of surprised... my backtest for June (not exact; eyeballed a lot and "guessed" what I might of done) shows that your better off with the system as Eagle originally posted it (measuring thru the 1st hour of London open) vs going to 11pm to 2am EDT (stopping the measuring box AT the London open instead of 1 hour AFTER the open)... Using GBP/USD, had about 220 pips for the month and 1 losing trade using the original system (5-8 GMT) vs 151 pips and 5 losers using 4-7 GMT)... Let me know if someone finds a dramatically different result... :surprised

hello eagle! first of all thank you for that indicator - it took me some time to realise how metatrader works but now i can see your indicator which timeframe for the boxes to you use? 5 - 8 or 6 - 9 im from austria and in the same timeframe as you are how to you place your order exactly? do you handle with a limit buy on the top of the box and a limit sell on the bottom of the box? thanks for your answer

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Can you tell us more about this filter? Thanks for sharing. Also, we all have been debating time parameters for the system (4 to 7, 5 to 8, 6 to 9 GMT), does any one have "tradestation" or a program that will allow decent back testing? I am not a programmer and have no idea how to set up rules that allow this testing . It would be interesting to see the results of 12 months worth of data comparing the different start times and the SL levels (is 15 pips the best?). Eagle is "THE MAN" and I respect him for sharing this information. But the last few days have all been effected by news events that caused "break outs". It would be nice to see how profitable the system would be when we looked a data containing "news" and "no news" days. Eagle...THANK YOU VERY MUCH! Have fun in Tunisia, brother

--- 帖子 #191 ---
How about lorix takes that idea to a new thread, as not to dilute this concept? Thanks

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I have AmiBroker that will do an accurate backtest. It will be a little labor intensive because I'll have to manually start and stop the backtest to insure that Daylight Savings Time is accounted for. I'll also have to find a source for the dates of the changeovers. I also will be unable to distinguish between news days and non news days. Other than that, it will do a good backtest. It will optimize the PT and SL.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
GREAT! Thanks for doing that Billbss . It would be a huge help to all. At this point, I think that if enough days are in the data that is tested it will not matter if they are "news vs. "no news" days...it will all come out in the wash. If there is anything that I can do to help, please let me know. It sure would be wonderful to consistently make 30 + pips each day .

--- 帖子 #201 ---
thank you eagle for your quick answer! so you take the timeframe 5 - 8 ?? please let me know if im right! thanks sweety

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hello, First of all: Bravo Eagle, grazzie tanti! Now, having read the post, I am still not sure about the start time and end time when the box should be determined. Note that I do know the time references (gmt and so on), and I do know that each MT4 broker uses it’s own time reference on the platform. We just have to compare our local time to the platform time and adjust the indicator accordingly. What I am not sure I understand is when the period is supposed to be calculated, after reading so many references here… My MAIN QUESTION is: - When is the 4 hour box period supposed to end when compared to the London open time? - London (that is the UK session) opens at 08h00 local ( London ) time. - Presently the London time is GMT+1 (summer time) - Looking at Eagle’s chart (see Post #150) I understand that the box period is between 06h and 09h, GMT+1 time, which is the present London time. - The indicator runs on a H1 chart =&gt; When the 09h candle ends it will be 10h in London (GMT+1). ð Then the box period is between 6am and 10am London time? ð In other words the box finishes 2 hours after London/Uk session opens? Also: - When I put the indicator on my charts, in a way that it matches Eagle’s charts, then I come also to the same conclusion: the analysis period ends at 10 am London time, which is when the orders should be placed. Is this correct?? Can Eagle or someone confirm? Thanks MD

--- 帖子 #203 ---
[quote=bluejet;1500506] Here is an example of today's trades on GBPJPY the red arrows are shorts. BTW the EA did this automatically 5 good trades today on gbpjpy

--- 帖子 #204 ---
you place your orders at the open time of London. That is 7 am GMT. The levels are set by the highs and lows of the previous 3 hour candles Don't forget to allow for your spread. My spread is 3 pips on Cable.. which means i have to set my buy orders for 1.5 pips BELOW the mid price to get it to come in at the right point. My sell orders have to be placed 1.5 points above the lower breakout. So for a ten pip gain it has to move 13 pips... Can be confusing... (certainly i got it wrong a few times and it cost me!) Good luck!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Guys, Eagles original system is to have the box STOP measuring 1 hour AFTER the London open. We are also exploring if his system works better with the box stopping the measuring AT the London open. Appreciate Billrss doing a more accurate test on this...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
That's the way I understood the system. What threw me is that Eagle's charts do not coincide with the times he has stated. He is looking for breakouts from 9AM London time on, not 8AM.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Eagle, Are still here or have you gone to Tunisia already? Maybe the easiest way for us to understand the hours of the box is: =&gt; At what time - Italian time - do you put your (limit) orders? The hour the limit orders are entered is when the 4 hour period/box has ended, right? So knowing the Italian time that you enter your limit order allows us to calculate when is that in our time. Italy has one hour more than the UK. So if you enter your orders at: - 11h in Italy =&gt; 10h in the UK =&gt; 2 hours after London opens - 10h in Italy =&gt; 09h in the UK =&gt; 1 hours after London opens - 09h in Italy =&gt; 08h in the UK =&gt; hour that London opens Which is it? Thanks again MD

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Just compare Eagles charts with your charts... you'll see he is stopping the measuring bar at 1 hour AFTER the London open...

--- 帖子 #209 ---
You guys may be right. I got confused with the times so what i did was compared the actual bars on the first chart with those on my timeframe... I run on GMT even though i am in England as i find it less confusing with the changes.. It seemed to me that the chart worked with the orders being placed at the start of the London open... Sorry if i got it wrong.. maybe it works better if the orders are place at 8 gmt... Easy enough to change the time on indicator and look back on the charts i guess... I think it probably works either way... I just checked back on the first post... have a look.. Look at the 13th July and compare it with your charts. The bar that breaks out of the zone is the 7 gmt bar... (man oh man!)

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Who is your broker? Your broker time is very important...GMT +? Thanks

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I use igforex. I set my charts to run on GMT+0 although time here in England is GMT + 1. London currently opens at 8am local time which is 7am GMT. If you look back at the first charts and see where the breakout box is drawn, i think you will find it corresponds to the orders being placed at the opening of the London session. Normally this is when you get the big movement so it seems to make sense. However it is not my system and I may be wrong. However i think i am right that the period that is taken by the indicator is the 3 hour candles before the London open... Normally i see some big movement at around 6am gmt (which i think is the European markets opening?) Then at 7am gmt it all really gets going when London opens... I try and trade London breakout if is looking clear... I would look for a breakout, retrace and then take the confirmation before trading it. I think Eagles system is very exciting and i hope it works so I can make lots of money all the time..

--- 帖子 #212 ---
There seem to be a lot of similarities to this method, which I use successfully. The SL is tighter but otherwise quite similar. http://www.forex-tsd.com/manual-trad...asian-low.html Am I mistaken? Is this better or not as good, in your opinion? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
The last two charts that Eagle posted show him waiting until 9AM London time to start looking for breakouts. I didn't look back any further than that.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
It's very similar. Eagle has more definitive rules in his system. The other one leave a lot to your imagination.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
End of the box for breakout is: 08:00 GMT 09:00 UK 10:00 CET (Europe) 04:00 EST (US East Coast) 01:00 PST (US West Coast)

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks Howard...nice post...very clear...!! Now, I think we need to determine WHICH time frame is BEST or creates the highest profit.... starting to trade AT the London open, or waiting for 1 hour AFTER the London open? This is where a definitive test would be welcome from someone smarter then me

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Howard, great post! I agree with Audionut... We now need to see which time frame is best. The above indicates that Eagle's original settings are correct (5 and 8 GMT) for the "inputs". Thanks.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi everyone! Great thread and thanks for all the imput. I'm a newbie wrt MT4. I've loaded the indicator, but my MT4 platform is GMT +3. So my $64,000 question is, how do I, and where do I go to, change the start and end time for this indicator so that it indicates at the right time? I tried the MT Editor, but I couldn't open the file to change the times. I tried changing the times in the "input" box but it wouldn't let me do that either. I'm stumped on this one. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Cheers all and have a great day! Nancy

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Right click on your chart where the indicator is loaded. Go to Indicator List. Select the indicator and click Edit. You will then see all the fields that you can change. I hope that helps. Tom

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Thanks Tom! Oh my gosh! I need more sleep. I was in that before but it never dawned on me that I had to double click in order to change the numbers. Duh. Sometimes the simplest things can be the hardest. Thanks again! Nancy

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Ok I have a question for anyone who's good at this indicator stuff. I'm trying to set this indicator to capture the Asian open. I'm changing the times to periodBegin: 23:00 periodEnd: 2:00 and Boxend: 12:00 for example. But the boxes get really messed up. Somehow the red box starts at 2 and then ends the next day at 23:00 and it all gets reversed. Would anyone know what needs to be changed in the code to have this work with the Asian session since under GMT is starts in one day and ends in the next? I'm just curious if this method would work similarly during the Asian as it does for the London. (or if anyone has already looked into this and has some thoughts that would be great too) Thanks! Tom EDIT: Never mind.... The hours I was inputting are wrong anyway. Realised this when I woke up today.

Hi Tom, I input the Asian times and it seems to work well. My time inputs were: Period begin: 1900 EDT, Period end: 2200 EDT and Box End: 0800 EDT. Now it worked for me because my MT4 server is GMT +3 so the actual timings for me on the charts are: 0200, 0500 and 1500 hours respectively. Hope this helps Nancy

I've seen some Italian speakers in this thread. I'm sure someone will see this and help. I used Babelfish and got the same translation as you did. It's still not clear. From looking at Eagle's charts, I think we are missing something. I don't think he is doing a simple breakout of the box. I believe he is buying and selling within the box.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
No problem Tom. Happens to all of us sometimes.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes...Eagle, if you wish to put your thoughts into Italian, I can have your words translated into English very quickly. Then, we might not lose something becasue of the language barrier. Let me know your thoughts about the idea. Also, I am sure that many of us are interested in your latest post about about "tendency". You are obviously very talented and it should not be your responsiblitiy to learn English when you are the one sharing the advice. Thanks...Now, go have fun in Tunisia!

Hi Sweety78901.... Thanks for sharing your success story with the group. You mention that you were able to make 10 pips from the eur/jpy? Attached please see 2 charts, one is using the input settings of 4 to 7 GMT and one is using 5 to 8 GMT. On both of them I don't see how this is possible during the 8 GMT or 9 GMT candle. May I ask you to show me what you did? What inputs did you use and what broker's data feed do you use? Perhaps you might have a "screen shot"? Chart "1" is uses 4 to 7 GMT inputs and Chart "2" uses 5 to 8 GMT inputs. Red lines define the start of the long and short breakout areas and another red line shows the maximum movement of price.... it does not appear to make 10 pips + spread. Thanks for your help, maybe I am doing something wrong?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thanks Billbss, I will have my colleague translate it by noon (EDT) today and I will post the result. Also, you mentioned that you might do some back testing to see about the best inputs to use (the original 5 to 8 GMT or 4 to 7 GMT). I found someone who has "tradestation" and this weekend we will attempt to also back test the data. Maybe we can compare notes on Monday? Thanks

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I use Metatrader with IBFX (which uses GMT) and I'm in the UK. I have set this with 03:00 and 06:00, in other words 4am to 7am local time. I prefer to use it on the 5 minute chart though, because I'm not sure how the candle after 06:00 GMT affects the box, i.e. is the high/low from that also included. Using the 5 minute chart the last time that can be included is 06:04:59. I find this shows a bit more accurate break outs , potentially even earlier than it would otherwise so a few more pips. I'm a newbie so feel free to poke holes in my theory, but it makes sense for me! happy trading, SF412

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Here we go with the translation Breakout from 6:00 to 9:00 When the box is formed put a buy order outside the higher side of the box and a sell order outside the lower side of the box. Target profit 10 pips + spread, losses aren't so high and taking care about this system I'm quite always in profit. To handle the stoploss I'm working on an indicator so that we can only put only one order (a buy or sell at a time). I know my english isn't so much good, hope this is better than Babelfish Anwyay I will try to keep in touch with Eagle to speak about his trading method so that we can reorganize in more readible way the thread. Per Eagle : Ehi Eagle sentiamoci via Skype così mi spieghi un pò tutto come funziona il tuo metodo e vediamo di sistemare tutto e fare capire a tutti come utilizzarlo. ciao ciao Skyline

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Sounds good. I should have mine completed by then. I have several years of data.

to skygod! eur/jpy i entered the trade at 168.52 and the break out goes to 168.39 - i entered a buy option at 168.42 ( these are the prices inclued already the spread of 2 pips ). i put a stopp loss at the end of the other side of the breakout box because i saw that when the price break out in one direction and did not get the 10 pips for the first time it is very likely that it will break the next time. i don´t know how to create and set up an screen shot. i already make 10 pips with usd/jpy but i have set the time for the boxes to 6 - 9 gmt for these curreny pair hope this answer help you

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Eagle! thank you sooo much for sharing your wonderful system with us.. I have only one question. Most probably others must have noticed too that in few instances, there are False Breakout happening. For instance I hope you guys can see my attachment if not just check out last 3 EUR/JPY breakouts which are as follows: 2007.07.18 14:00 168.42 Fake breakout upward 2007.07.19 10:00 168.14 Fake breakout downward 2007.07.20 10:00 168.82 Fake breakout upward These are 3 consecutive Loser trades. I just wanted to share this with everyone. I hope someone knows how to avoid these Traps. Thanks. chao! my 10 cents.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Your boxes are drawn one bar too early. You are starting to look for breakouts at 8AM London time 0700 GMT. Eagle starts at 9AM London time (0800 GMT) He at first WROTE that he started as you are. When he displayed his charts, it was apparent that he started an hour later- 9AM London time. Eagle's message, that was translated this morning, seems to confirm that. PS- IMO- I wouldn't trade EUR/JPY keyed to the British open. I would trade it either at the European open or the Japanese open.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Billbss, thank you for the clarification... EUR/JPY does seem little unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thanks very much . The difference in our results is becasue of the differnce in times that we use in the input section of the indicator. I was using 5 to 8 GMT and I see that you are using 6 to 9 GMT. Perhpas the Euro and Pound based currencies require there own time frames? If I used the 5 to 8 GMT inputs on this pair (E/J), I would have had a lose. Thanks again! BTY... To do a "screen shot", using MT4, simply click "file" in the upper left of the platform and then click on "save as a picture"....it will safe as a gif file. Hope this helps.

IO STO' LAVORANDO SUL FALSO BREAKOUT E ST0'CERCANDO UN INDICATORE CHE PUO' DARE LA TENDENZA MIGLIORE DEL BREAKOUT IN MODO DA INSERIRE SOLO UN ORDINE A VALUTA

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Skyline did a great job with translation... here is another version in which he talks about lots sizes and the fact that he does not use SL. Just my two cents Breakout from 06:00 to the 09:00. At closing, breakout to place the purchase orders from the high of the “box” (I am thinking “range”) and sale order from the bottom of “box” - target profit 10 pips + spread, stop loss? I do not use it because I place mini lots from 0.02/0.03 therefore the loss is not high, but considering the system I always “go in profit” (he usually wins??). For the stop loss I am preparing a trend indicator, thus (so that) we can place only an order for currency either high or low. Please excuse me, but I must write in Italian. Many gains for all! Have a great weekend all!

Hi all So the TP s 10Pips+spread and stoploss ??? which is the best paires for this System? Regards

--- 帖子 #260 ---
INDICATOR

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Eagle originally said the SL is 15 pips. He also said the best pairs are GBP/USD , GPP/JPY This was in one of his early posts.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
but i think that SL 15 will be bad? Regards

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I'm not sure. We are doing some backtesting. There should be some results soon. Eagle also just posted an indicator. He said it will help with the SL. I haven't looked at it yet, so I don't know how it works.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
could you help me to get this Indicator co i can't found it the last post for Eagle is the Bout indictor with a diff. time Regards

--- 帖子 #265 ---
You are right. That is not the indicator that I assumed it was. Eagle stated the SL was 15 pips. We are doing some backtesting to see if that can be improved.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Guys Have been watching this thread with some interest. I think you can filter a lot of false signals using a stochastics oscillator set to 5,3,3,close and only enter long when signal is over 80 / short when under 20. It might mean you delay entry until will into the day but a quick scan back on GBPUSD and this looks like it has potential. All the best Jason

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks for contributing to the group effort . Hopefully, on Monday we will have some results of back testing to see which time frame works best.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi guys, for a buy situation, do you wait for the bid or the ask price to pass the breakout zone? thanks.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Somebody try to backtest? for me this dont works.. http://i20.servimg.com/u/f20/11/12/22/22/chart10.gif http://i20.servimg.com/u/f20/11/12/22/22/tester10.gif

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Ledzep: if you want to test a system with such narrow stops and targets like 10 to 15 pips, the software has to account for the bid/ask-spread, which, to my knowing, metatrader cannot do in a feaseable way. I have some similar approaches already coded in my own custom written backtester, so i ran this system through 3 years of oandas tickdata, since it wasnt much work for me. The result is catastrophic. Settings i used: 10 pips target, 15 pips stop, range from 6 to 9 CET. Trading was limited to 9-13 CET. Times adjusted on CET-DST rules. If anyones interested, i can post the system-stats and transaction-list. On a side note, all cable morning-breakout approaches i track seem to perform really bad since Jan 2007.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
shrike: What software do yo use to backtest oanda tick data?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I'm trying to backtest it on AmiBroker and am getting very bad results with it, also. I'll double check my code before I post the results to make sure I haven't made a mistake.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I wrote my own software in VB.NET. My program chews either thru tick-files or realtime tick-streams and outputs transaction-lists. I use neoticker to analyze those transaction-lists and generate stats/equity-curves, and another program that i wrote myself to analyze P/L-distributions.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Your testing is much more sophisticated than mine. I'm using Alpari 1M bars with AmiBroker. BTW- I do know of a GBP breakout system that has done really well this year. It's hitting over 80% winners. Profit/ risk is 20/30, but it tests even better with a 35/30. Someone was running a journal thread on this system a couple of months ago and the Mod deleted it. I don't want to say anymore about it because of that.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
so we have 3 different software packages 1 MT4 using Breakout eagle Ea 2 Visual basic using Oanda 3 AmiBroker using Alpari All three are returning poor results. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
smjones: i am not entirly clear what stoploss eagle uses and what timerange, so his system may be quite different from what i did tested.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I think this is one thing that no one is clear about. Looking at some of the charts he has posted recently, some are using 5-8am GMT and others 4-7am. So I don't know if he uses a different time range for different currency pairs or what. Then I also saw the 6-9am range indicator he has posted a couple of times and that really throws me off. (on a side note, through the little testing I have done on my own the 6-9am range does not do well) The other thing I wanted to point out is that I think the targets (both profit and stop loss which from what I understood are 10 and 15 pips) are not the most efficient we can use. Sure you might get a higher win %, but that is irrelevant. Because a 15 pip stop loss plus spread (say 18 pips total for the GBPUSD) is almost double the 10 pip profit target. And more often than not, these breakouts go for much more than 10 pips. I think by increasing the profit target to say 20, it would really increase the expectancy of the system overall. Win % will go down, but profit will increase. Anyway, I'm still doing my own testing with different pairs and time ranges. I will keep everyone posted of my findings. But so far, I wouldn't call this system dead yet based on backtesting. Tom

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I have tried all possible time ranges with poor results. I was using SL 15 and PT 10. Optimizing the SL and PT using 1M bars is very slow. I have not completed that yet. From what I've seen so far, I'm almost certain it will be a loser no matter what parameters are used.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Eagle uses 10 pips + spread for PT. His SL is up in the air. I think lets it run and uses a discretionary exit. We've nailed his time range to 6-9 AM London time.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Why not, if it is a winning method post it here or refer us to it.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
That's what I thought too. But if you look at post #225 you'll notice he's using 4-7GMT (5-8am London time)

--- 帖子 #283 ---
No, his boxes on that chart end at 9AM London time. (0800 GMT) I just double checked them.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
No they don't. See my chart attached below. It is set at 4:00-7:00GMT (ending at 8am London time) His chart here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=225 But I have also seen some GBPUSD charts of his using 5-8. Thus my confusion.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
You are mistaken. I've checked it again. The boxes on that chart end with the 0700 GMT bar. These are 1H bars. The 0700GMT bar begins at 0700 GMT and ends at 0800 GMT. 0800 GMT = 9 AM London time. If you set the indicator for 4 to 7, it draws the box to end at the 0700 bar. Again, the 0700 GMT bar ends at 0800 and 0800 GMT is 0900 London time.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Ok there's some miss-communication here. What you're saying is correct. I didn't word myself correctly. I'm speaking strictly of what the indicator range is. So if you were to set the indicator from 4-7 that is 5-8 London time. But of course that 7:00GMT (8 London time) candle ends at 8am GMT (9 London time). But what I'm saying, is that some of Eagle's charts are using 4-7 (indicator range) and others are using different ranges. That's why I'm confused. In post #225 he is using 4-7GMT for his indicator. But in posts #4, #12 and #150 the time ranges are different.

Thank you for your great work. I was about to start trying this setup live today, but after reading your posts I decided to wait and see how it was going to be today without news, and today it was a loosing day for this setup, the pair reversed at 9.5 pips (without spread) only, and hit the SL of 15 pips already.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Ok boys and girls.... Yesterday, Sunday EDT, me and a programmer friend sat in an office for 4 hours working with "tradestation" in an attempt to backtest this "break out" system. I am not sure if we were ever able to do a genuine backtest becasue the programming can be complicated. 1) We were not sure if we were matching the data to GMT. 2) We had issues getting the program to count "shorts'. 3) Our data was limited to 6 months (which is nothing). With that said.....our results might be "garbage", but we tried our best. Mixing start times (inputs) and varying the SL and TP from January 07 to July 07 showed poor results. This bummed us out because we had big hopes for the system. Perhaps I should not have generated this post....but we did a lot of work and I thought that it might have some value. I am sure there must be some much smarter people out there who can do a decent back test. Thanks

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I reached the same conclusion. I could not get Amibroker to properly account for the spread. That should have worked in favor of this system. I tested GBP/USD from April1 through Friday. It lost big money with every reasonable combination of PT and SL and in both of the time periods we have discussed. I saw enough to not want to spend any more time on it.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Fair enough. Thanks for all the backtesting guys. I think executing this method purely on a set S/L and Profit target would not work over the long run. Discretion needs to be used for the exit (profit or stop loss). And based on some of Eagle's posts, it seems that he does use some discretion. But that opens up a whole new can of worms so there's no point of going into that. Take care, Tom

--- 帖子 #297 ---
@Billbss.... Well, misery loves company. I am sorry that you had trouble with the testing too. So, what do you think? Is our testing flawed or is the system flawed? When I only used data from June 07 and coupled it with stochastics (from post #266) it seemd to work very well on the GU pair. Maybe I was "curve fitting" the data becasue I wanted the system to be a winner? I welcome your comments. Thanks for taking the time to attempt the back test.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks for the comment....... I agree. Fixed SL and TP do not seem to work, nor does blindly entering the trade with pending orders at the each side of the box. Oh well? Someone please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I think it's a losing system. If Eagle makes money with it, he's using a lot of discretion with rules that we don't know about. It might be possible to tweak it by expanding the width of the box or tying the PT and SL to the ATR etc. and make it a winner. I think there are better systems on this forum and elsewhere to spend time on.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
What systems do you think are the best?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Ok guys. Hi I've had a look at this indi and really like it. The only thing though is that I see most are using 3hours to draw the box, and which 3 hours during the Euro opening session seems to differ as well. So try my take on it. No matter what charting you use, use GMT time. I am only using 2 hours to calculate my box. And that will 5GMT till 7GMt. Europe opens at 7GMT. I use a 15min TF, but you can use anything from 1min to 30min, and here's why. On my 15min chart I have placed a 30min 30ema. So from 5GMT to 7GMT my 'breakout zone' has been determined yeah. So now I wait, and wait, chat to mates on SKYPE, and wait some more, have breakfast and wait some more till the breakout occurs. The breakout occurs, I don't enter then. I go brush my teeth, make a cup of tea and then come back to my computer to trade. The reason for explaining it this way is for those who are always wanting to 'pull' the trigger and chase the market. Yes there are those who are able to do that, I'd rather go make a cup of tea and relax. Why relax? Because once the breakout has occured, I will place an order 3 pips away from my 30min 30ema, in the same direction of breakout. This way, I am waiting for the pullback to the 30ema. My stop can then be 15 pips other side the 30min 30ema. If the breakoput was false and I entered the trade and the market came back and hit my stop, I lose. But most breakouts occur in that zone have a pullback to roughly the 30min 30ema. That way when my order no gets triggered, many time it's on par with what the breakout was, some times even a bit better, but at least my stop is now for of certain than just chasing after the market. If the breakout was false, then many time you are able to enter a trade in the opposite direction, enter at the half way price of the high and low of your 'breakout zone'. Then also use 20 pip stop. I will then all day long keep placing orders 2 pips from the 30min 30ema, but now my stop can be smaller. We can only be wrong once during the day, the other way has to work. Don't chase em, let them show you there hand, then let them come fetch your business. Kind regards always Susan

Hi everyone, I did a backtest on GBPUSD and I got good numbers. I do not know how to use EA so I download historical data form September 2006 to July 2007. I got 1,525 pips in profit. I download it to a Dbase or FoxPro DB and played with it. I hope I made no mistake on programming. The data I used was Time 6:00 to 9:00 (please let´s no start the time thing) A target of 35 Pips. A StopLoss of 50 pips (I found these numbers to be the best) If a trade was open in ethier directon but the target was not meet, then the deal is closed at day end. I attached an XLS file for you. Even when the file I used is 30 min chart the time frame is from 6 to 9. The importat fields are... The Hours and Minutes look like 6-0 or 6-30 is actually 6:00 and 6:30. HighReached and LowReached: which are the high and low of the TimeBox. This Line is just below the end of the 9:30 data line at 9:30 candle close. Signal: This is the Line when the profit, Stoploss or end of the day is reached. Pips: Pips made. Example for the first 13 lines of the file Line 10 shows a High of 1.8955 and a Low of 1.820(This is our timeBox) Line 12 show "Short TP" and 35 Pips. It means that the Action was going short and the TakeProfit was hit. Hope it helps. PD The XLS file also includes a screen dump of my chart. I´m in Mexico with my time set at GMT-6. Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Sorry, I forgot to mention an extra filter I use. Still on 15min TF in the same window I have a 60min 5-3-3 stoch and a 4hr 8-3-3 stoch. Just following them with the 30ema, you will win more often than not. One last word, I have mates who are keeping a watchful eye on many currencies, 5 to 8 etc. If you concentrate just on 3, then there is no reason why 50 pips a day cannot be the norm. And personally I do not trade eur, as I make my tea in my time. I don't let a currency have me wait on it to move snail pace. I just trade gbpusd, usdchf and euryen and I average no less than 60 pips a day no sweat. And don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to blow my own horn. It's just that we always read that we have to aim for 20 pips a day. Well that's what I read and learnt when I started a year ago. And I personally think that slowed my growth rate down extremely much. This is probably the most easiest and simplest method one can use. It works and it's very profitable. As you get more experience you'll learn to close only some of your positions and leave some over night. After weeks and weeks and months and months you'll have so many many small positions that all have a healthy profit, that you'll be able to only have to trade 2 mayb 3 days a week. And that is the idea is it not. Tha's why we all started off slaving in front of the screens, learning and learning method ater method. So we can enjoy time with our families and friends. It's just a note to all who feel down, or disheartened or whom think it cannot be done, it can you will yeah. Kind regards always Susan

Thanks for sharing and being open with your ideas, I am sure that we are all very grateful .

Thanks Skydog. I will dive more in to it. I think we can make this strategy work. Will be posting more results soon. Reynold

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Susan, This is very encouraging to see that you are making good pips everyday. I am a bit confused about the 30min 30 EMA. The 30 EMA is calculated from 30 periods depending on what timeframe you apply it too. So if you apply a 30 EMA to a 30 min chart is calculates 30 x 30 min time periods. So if you apply a 30 EMA to a 15 min chart it calculates 30 x 15 min time periods. So if you apply a 30 EMA to a 15 min chart and to a 30 min chart it is not plotting identical lines on each chart. If I place a 30 EMA on a 30 min chart to get the same line or close to it I would need to plot a 60 EMA on a 15 min chart. Can you clarify what you mean by a 30min 30EMA?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Breakout systems work in theory -- if you can handle the monotony of drawdowns that follow. My primary system that I use (I have one I use and one automated system on futures contracts) does 650 pips consecutive drawdown. That's enough for me. But I get 900-1300 consecutive pips runup... Hans123 system will do 400 pips in the red, 50 in the black, 200 in the red, 200 in the black, 1000 in the red, etc... That sucks. I can't handle 6 out of 12 months losing... that's a horrible system IMO and wouldn't pass my development.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Spirirtbreezer, I have been looking at your chart set up on the 15 min chart for gbp and I don't see many great set ups using the retrace back to the 30 EMA after the initial breakout. Could you post one of your recent trades so we could take a look at how you are trading the breakouts and what you look for? Thank you...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Spiritbreezer, I'm very interested in your post, I've taken time to have a look at it and would like to go ahead and test it. Before I do please can you clarify the following: What is your take profit target, or do you trail your trades? Do you only trade when both stochastic's are in the direction of the breakout? Do you only trade when the 30/30 sma is in the area of the breakout box? If you could post a picture of a trade set up it would be great. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hello Spiritbreezer... Please take a look at the attached files. They are the pairs that you favor, gbp/usd - usd/chf - eur/jpy. I used the 15 minute TF and added the 30ema and 60 min stoch (the 4 hr stoch does not seem to work). It seems like your method did stop me from being "faked out" in usd/chf this morning . But here are my questions: 1) What to do when the 30 ema (blue line) is not in the box at the time of a break out??? Please see charts for gpb/usd and eur/jpy. On the e/j the 30 ema is way above the box and on the g/u it is way below the box during a break out. In the g/u chart, the break out is headed towards the 30 ema. Should these situations be a "no trade"? 2) The use of 60 min stoch.... Do you just look for a general direction (up or down) to confirm the trade, or do you actually wish to see it touch the "80" or "20 " level to confirm the trade? 3) What are your ideas about TP? Please answer, if you have time. Thanks again for your help

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Climax, You could have made 10 pips on each of those trades...it worked perfectly from your example chart. A 15pip SL is way too small for the GBP/USD or GBP/JPY. I've used this system and often times I do not use any SL. The key is to keep it at 10pips only, depending on market condition. If you feel more comfortable putting in a SL. I would recommend a SL 1 or 2pips above the High(above the box if in a short trade) and 1or2pips below the LOW(below the box if going Long). This system is not 100% but it is very good break out system for 10pips a day. Very simple system. You may even trade without the assistance of the box. Often times I find the box annoying, so I tend to trade without it.

Sorry for being away for a while. But blame these forums for this. We come here and take bits and pieces from every bodys threads and add them to our charts to see how they work. And by doing that we learn adapt and evolve in the field of Forex. Which is Fantastic. I have changed, or rather evolved things to be much better now. I'll share all I know with you know, as that way I know we can make it better. There's alot of info gonna follow so I'll break it up into bits. But stick with it.

I use these. I break the different time frame into segments. I'll take the open of that time frame, meaning that with the period seperators vertical lines on, I take it from the open of the new period. So only a weekly time frame, I use the open of the new year. I'll draw a horizontal line, then lines above and below at 360 pip intervals. Using your fibo channel tool it's easier. I then take the daily time frame, and draw a horizontal line on the open of the new month, then again pips above and below at 180 pip intervals. Then on the 4hr time frame, again horizontal line at weekly open and horizontal lines 50 pip intervals up and down. I will also only use one fib retracement, and that is from the high to low of last week. Or low to high depending on which way the trend went. Picture 090 will get explained n next post.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Ok, so the first pic then is of a 4hr chart, where I can see all the supp and res from all the time frames. It may look messy to some, but because you drew those lines, and made them your own, you will know what they eman. On the previous post was a pic of the moving averages I use. If you use an hourly chart, like the pic, and traded it naked, no candles or bars, and just when the 12nonlag crossed the 13 smoothed ma, then you will win way way way more than you lose. Now using the sup and res lines in combination with this, pips on! Ok, so now we know trand direction by looking at the hour chart and where the 10 non lag is in accordance to the 13 smooth yeah. So now the juicy bits get started when we switch to 30min. Here we still look for 10non lag to cross the 12sma in way of trend. Now the box thing. I have seen some guys post there charts for explanation, but they have a black background and the box is like aqua or something bright. I would suggest to change the colour of your boxes so that you can see what is happening on the inside. My box time, not GMT as mentioned previously sorry about that. My charts are using Europe time, so GMT plus one. My box times are still 05:00 to 07:00. The box is an addition to the setup of the crosses on the 30 min, like an affirmation.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Ok, so we look at the juicy 30 min chart. I hope you guys are prepared for this, because you are going to be trading all day yeah. On the 30min chart we use the 12 non lag and the 10 ma. We are looking to buy if the 10ma is above the 70ma and to sell if it is below. Importantly are the stochs 5-3-3 of the 60min and 30 min. We do not trade against the hourly stoch. We let the hourly and 30min help us with momentun and we let the nonlag and 10 tell us direction In the first pic you see clearly how at 10:30 the nonlag was looking to cross the 10 down, at same time stochs were turning down, then we had it concide with the box breakout. All the while the stochs are showing momentum down and the ma are showing us direction down, we looking to sell. If we get a bull candle we sell again 1 pip below it, and so forth. The second example is of a bullish trend and the buys we do. Now these are just naked charts, without the previous supp and res lines. So once combined it becomes more powerful. Stops and exits. Well this is to each his own, but if you look at your 4hr supp and ress for the week, it will give you an idea. I forgot to mention: If you look at price it's forever spiking up and down on the charts. Now the nonlag is like price, just it has the rough edges polished. So when it crosses another ma, like the 70ma or 4hr 50ema etc etc, it is a good sigh, so can enter at the cross only if stochs are on your side. So in the second pic, when price broke out of the box, the nonlag crossed the 70ma, so good sign to long.

Hi Spiritbreezer, Very interesting chart set up. So are you concerned with the overall long term trend direction, say determined by the 4hr chart? Most traders would advise you to trade with the trend. Do you take only set ups that trade in the overall trend direction or do you feel with this system you can take counter trend trades?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Spiritbreezer, How did you arrive at the intervals of 360 for weekly and 180 for daily chart?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hello....don't worry, we were all new to forex at some point (even the high and mighty among us). I think that you are asking how to load indicators onto your MT4 platform, yes? If so...follow this process: 1) Down load the subject indicator to your desktop (don't open it). 2) On the lower left of your windows screen you will see "start", right click it and then press "explore". 3) Once in explore, get to "programs" and expand it. Then find where your trading platform lives (look for the name). 4) Expand this section and then open "experts", then open "indicators". 5) Go back to your desk top and right click the indicator that you down loaded and pick "copy". Then go back to the indictor section that you found when exploring your programs and paste it into "indicators". 6) Restart your MT4 program. This is how I do it....let me know if you need more help.

Hi skygod, Thank for your help. I can open that indicator after follow your step by step as above. I will backtesting and feedback the result asap. Hopefully this system can help us earn alot money loh...haha have a nice day

Hi uguys Ozzie Dave from down under via America, sounds like a rap tune Ok I read somewhere on this forum about a strategy that uses the 4hr 50pip levels last year, but had forgotten about it. I will try and find it and post the link here. I had a friend about 2months ago make a similar box indicator but whidh draw tp and taget points etc, and I tried it for diff times of the day. And it was whilst having many of these on the charts that I saw that there are specific supply and demand points on the charts eveyweek, and then rememebered the 4hr 50pip levels things. So logic says if there are 4hr levels there should be higher levels too. So just played around and found that 180 and 360 work best. Trade from this morning. First pic, cable hourly crossed down beofer midnigh, so now wait for stochs on 30min and 60 min. Second pic, see here 30min cross down, so instead of selling 2 pips below bull candle I waited. The reason was I had a 4hr level right there and experience tells me that if we had broken through on the next candle we would have a pullback candle. Stochs still kept heading down so put sell order 2 pips below the candle that hit the level. Got filled at 456 with target being 50 pips down next 4hr level, we broke through that and stochs still down, so next target next 4hr level at 362. Easy as pie. This method is so so well complimented by the strategy called '4 hour strategy(300+pips per month)' by a gentleman called Phillip Nel from S. Africa. I too am from S.AFrica, so great minds mmmmmmmmmm : Look it up, and on the first post is the PDF for the strategy. If you can just grasp the idea behind the macd histogram giving you signals, you'll be well on your way. I don't use anything elase of that strat except for the macd, I also don't look for patters or draw the lines on the macd, mayb I should start. I know it's weekend, but spend as much time in front of the computer as you can whilst you don't have to worry about trading and you can give this you full attention. Draw you levels, aand go over and over different weeks. Kewl beans

--- 帖子 #325 ---
So the previous pics I explained and showed without having the box on so you could see it clearer, now look. The breakout was beautiful. I would also like to thank 'eagle' again for bringing this to our attention, and I do apologise to him if it seems as if I am trying to change his breakout system. That is not my intention at all yeah. I too am trying to better ever day . Kind regards

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Here are 2 more examples of this morning. First pic, EurYen the hourly was showing sell, so wait for stochs to turn. Here we can look to sell 2 pips below the low of the bull candle cause it was below the 4hr level with target next 4hr level, but crashed through it, so target next 4hr level. Looking at this yeah, one can now start to think in the larger picture, by trading lots and the scaling them down at every level you hit. So following this from Tuesday you would probably have 10 lots still running short on euryen, with many many lots trade short and exited in between, and your ten lots would have entry points all lower than each other as you kept taking short signals, exitig some positions on profit and always letting the last one run till you get and exit from, say the non lag on hour crossing 70ma, and so on and so on. Second pic in euro, I don't trade it cause it does not move enough for me, buy I know it has its faithfull follower. But here we see hour showing short, but stochs heading up, so wait for them to turn. They then do, and we sell below the bull candle, and the next one and so forth. Kewl bean!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Sorry Dave, never answered your question about counter trend thoroughly. I will only enter a counter trend trade if I get a sig that the hourly stochs is turned down and the 30min stosh is ob if we get to a 4hr level or a fib from previous week. Importantly, you need to see that the hr stoch has turned over and that 30min is ob. That is what makes this method nice is that we are only using one indicator window, so can stretch it a bit bigger. With counter trend take profit quicker and move stop to b/e, not b/e plus spread cause it will often come back to the level 2 or 3 times before it goes down if it's gong to go down.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Spiritbreezer Very interesting study you did, cutting out a lot of lagging and trading more based on price action. Do you mind posting the Non lag MA indicator plus your 4H MA indicator? Where do you stay in SA? I am also a South African but do not stay in SA at the moment. Regards

--- 帖子 #329 ---
SpiritBreezer On post #326 what are those 2 time frames you are using on the pics? Also what is a lag mov avg that you use? And lastly, I presume that you are just using one chart to trade with on a 15 minute time frame? Thanks Johnny

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi guys At the bottom is the 4hr 50ema and the 60min stoch. The non lag is a few posts back, it reads 10nonlag, just change it to 12. The time frame I am using is 30min. The pics I posted will be 1hr on the left and 30min on the right. I take trades just in direction of where the nonlag is on the 1hr compared to the 1hr 13smooth. So a wrap up, on 1hr look for 12 nonlag to cross 13smooth. Then trades taken on 30 min when the 12 nonlag crosses 10 smooth. Also stoch have to be in you favour, I gew in Kimberley mate, living in UK now for 4 years, but going back home for good in 5 weeks. So real excited about that. I'll play some more this weekend see what I come up with, but I doubt we can get any better than price action itself. Don't forgetto read the PDF of Philip Nel to grasp the 4hr MACD histogram movement thing. O, have a great weekend all.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Spirit: Thanks for that info. Another question. From a few post back you would put all those lines from different time frames into one chart? I'm guessing that is how you came up with the support and resistance levels. That use to be a floor traders trick back then. They use to use the open to trade off of it. I know that they are still using it among other tools. Johnny

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Spiritbreezer, I'm a bit confused about the NLMA and Smoothed MA settings. On the hour and 30 min chart you use 12 NLMA. But for the smoothed MA you use 13 on the 1 hr and 10 on the 30 min chart. The 12 NLMA on the 1hr chart is equal to a 24 NLMA on a 30 min chart if I want to represent roughly the same MA on both charts. The same with the 13 smoothed on the 1 hr, it would be a 26 smoothed MA on the 30 min chart. I can't say that I understand why you have the same 12 NLMA on 1 hr and 30 min but you have 2 different settings for the smoothed for 1 hr and 30 min charts. If you use your settings the cross of the 12 NLMA and 13 smoothed MA on the 1 hr chart will not occur at the same time as the cross of the 12 NLMA and 10 smoothed MA on the 30 min chart. Also, what do you use the 4 hr 50EMA for? Sorry for so many questions.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Good questions Dave. The more questions that get asked the more we can understand why this works. If we use the same settings on the 30min as we use on the hour chart, then we'll have to be ready to take the trade when the crosses occur. The market is like energy. So once the trend turns, (crossig on the hour chart), it shows that the market energy is tuning. Now for us to get in on that if we did not at the crossing of the hour chart, we have to wait our turn. Trend was up, hourly chart crossed down so trend is down now. Now our turn comes when the downward momentum has died out a bit and more energy is required to push it down further. And to me this is on the 30min chart. When the non lag crosses up then back down again. This crossing up then back down signifies to me energy gather. It's like a battery recharged to drive the market further down. Hope this clarifies it a bit more. Besides, there are many ma crossing sytems which all work if you follow the properly. I just, obviously, like the one I thought of the most. Enjoy the rest of the weekend.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Spirit, Is it possible to attach the templates and list what time frames to attach them too? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hey Guys, I hope you all are having a great weekend. I am very interested in this system and am in the process of setting up my charts. I am having a problem setting up the 12 non lag moving average and would welcome any help you may have. I trade on the interbank platform and when I pull up the moving average box the only options are simple, exponential, smoothed and linear weighted. Any ideas what to do? Thank you in advanced for any help.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Spiritbreezer I must be blind, I see all the other indicators plus your screenshots, but not the Non Lag MA, can somebody please post the post Nr ,Please, Please? I will be greatfull, I do not know how but I went through the posts again 2 times but for the life of me can not see it. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Sorry.... I must be blind too because I don't see the "Non Lag MA" indicator either. Can you tell us in which post you placed it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Here is the Non Lag MA Indicator.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Ignore the tpl on this post, load up the tpl on post 340. Have a look at the ma's I use on daily time frame and higher. Just the 30ma, 70ma, 100ma and 200ma. If you look at cable specifically, we stopped 10 pips above the daily 30ma on Friday. I suspect well have a small bullish day on Monday bouncing of the 30ma at 219 and go up to last weeks 38% fib at 282. So that, I think, will be cables range for Monday. If break thge 30ma, then the next target will be the 70ma, but See how the ma's are all lined up it shows a good uptrend. On EurYen weekly we have bounced of the 30ma 5times since May, it lies at 160.81 and we are now at 161.71, so I reckon we'll drive down to that on Monday through Tuesday. It's small things like this that we will start to look out for and get to know how curerncies operate. All the indicators are oasted in the last 3 pages, so load em up first.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
This is gionna be quik, need to leave as going to outdoor concert with live bands I use the SHI-channel indicator or 4hr time frame and higher. So have the MTF channel indicator showing me the 4hr channel on smmaller time frames. Unfortunatly don't habe the quadrant one in MTF yet, but working on it.

This expert follows the explanation of eagle (hapalkos?) in the abovementioned thread. It estimates the high and the low between periodBegin and periodEnd and sets two pending/market trades to capture breakouts. This trades will be cancelled/closed at BoxEnd/BoxEndFriday. The only parameter which would not be evident is RiskedCapitalInPercent. If you set this value to 0 it will take 1 Lot for each trade. If you set it for example to 3 else it will risk 3% of your capital per trade. It is obligatory to utilze the following include file. Please copy it into your .\experts\include directory. The most actual version of OrderReliable I could put my hands on to, has a bug who does not allow a fallback from pending order to market order in case of a price which is to close. This is fixed in the actual version. This experts shall server to improve this method. Otherwise i suggest to let the discussion in this thread be too distracted as regards to expert-issues.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thanks for the EA, will test it tomorrow, Regards

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks Eagle for sharing this method. I've been using it for almost 2 weeks now and your technique really making money for me. I'm playing 3 pairs gbpusd, usdjpy &amp; eurjpy and no additional indicators, just plain Eagle breakout. You ROCK!

--- 帖子 #344 ---
THANKS ANASMI

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thanks eagle. Will try your breakout. I read in your post #182 that you will introduce a new strategy(single 5 pips + spread) when you arrive from vacation in Tunisia. Can you post your new strategy? In your post #183, you said you will give indicator of tendency for breakout. Is the indicator ready? Thank you and more pips to you!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
So you keep increasing your position. But at what rate? Do you wait for a certain amount of time, price movement, indicator based?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Susan a few questions if you don't mind. 60 pips/day is great but how do you calculate that? Per pair? How many open trades do you have on average? I find that a bit confusing. Eagle opens one trade and then waits for the 10 pip target. You open the trade and then keep adding near the "30min ema30" That could mean you add 10 lots to an initial breakout. Right? What exactly is your profit target? Or how do you exit. When you wrote 'many weeks/months' I assume you don't mean you are holding your position that long but that in that time you have a feeling when you leave the trade open overnight. When does 'overnight' start? At boxend?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Is the 70MA on M30 a SimpleMA ? Is the 10MA on M30 a SimpleMA ? MA 30/70/100/200 used on D1 and up are all SimpleMA? Message #318 The 1st picture shows a short trade. Do we enter at the breakout of the eagle box or do we wait for the price to go below 70MA? Can you post the PDF of Philip Nel or a link to it.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Ok, so you know I take 3 positions of which the thrird I let ride. Well let ride is basically that. Once my 3rd position goes profitable by x many pips, everybody has to determine there own, then on my third position I'll move stop to b/e. And I'll leave my stop at b/e till the next week. The reason for this is, because If you look at a 4hr chart, you'll notice the currencies I trade trend well. Say we're in a bulltrend and I took a position on Tueasday last week with the stop now at b/e. So for the week I'll keep an eue out to make sure that the currency does not retrace more than 61.8% from my position to the highest point of this week. What will normally happen is a currency will reatrce like 50 pips in the new wekk then continue in the same direction, bullish. Once it has done so, I then move my stop up to 15 pips below the low of this week. And leave it there till next week has made a new low then move it up. And so on and so on. That is why you'll end up with many many small positions, if I get stopped out so be it, I have some profit on that small ansd when I get stopped out I'll definately have a short position from higher up in place allready, if not many many small positions. So in other words, I'll be hedged to the teeth, and no matter what happens, I'm making the cash. As for how long I'll keep it? Till I'm stopped out. This is a lifetime goal, well I say goal but it's not actually. I goal has a start and end point, there is no end point to this. What you'll have to do, is create some sort of record for yourself whereby you can keep track of these many many orders. Maybe like what I've done. I bought a massive whiteboard for each currency and placed it on the wall. Then on the y-axis numbered it, choose your own way, then everyday just add in with a peice of paper and stick you position on there. Then finally have a thickish red paper to uses as a horizontal ruler to place on your board every 4hours and move it to where price is. Have a look at a 4hour chart and see what the results would be say since beginning of this year if you were able to just get 1 position in the right direction and then kept moving your stop up and up. Thanx for the question by the way.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi Yeah the ma are simple. I like them that way. But any ma with any price setting will work, if you adapt your trading style top it. I enter the tarde at the breakout of the box yes. Here is the name of the Phillip Nel strategy, just go to the trading systems page and it will be on the top ten 4 Hour Strategy (300+ Pips per Month) and the PDF is on the first page. Thanx for the questions.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Susan, Thanks for the answers. I hope you don't mind answering some more... So you open 3 positions. Do you open them all at once (at the 1st signal)? Or in another way. I ask because earlier in this thread you said you added several times at "30min 3EMA" You just enter 3 positions there or for example after a retest of the EMA? I understand things are personal, but can you give me a guideline on where you set your targets? (for 1st and 2nd) Are they just fixed numbers? Fib line? Stoch crossover? MA crossover? etc

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi, I take 3 positions at the same time when I get the signal yeah. I'll then only add one position at the 30ema every time. This stop will be 10 pips other side. It will be my supp in bull trend or res in bear trend. As to profitt taking, I'll close my first position as close to 15/20 as possible. You'll gather where after a while. You'll see pivots in the way, ma's in the way etc. The reason for this small first target, is because that is my spread plus some money in the bank. I can then take my second position and move the stop to b/e. So I therefore have 1 position open with stop at b/e and the third I'll keep the stop where it originally was when I took the 3 positions at the first time. So you know how to work the 3rd positions stop as I explained yesterday. So worst comes to worst, your 3rd position gets stopped out. But you have had 3 positions in the market, of which their spreads has been paid for, and the second one is at b/e, so you'll have one position stopped out. Now most people take one position and get stopped out. But as you get better and better you'll not get stopped out as often, you'll have your spread paid for, you'll have one position you'll need to manage all day whilst adding to it, and the 3rd positon you'll leave as is till next week. Take care

Hello all, When I first saw this thread I was amazed by the simplicity and I thanked Eagle for sharing his idea. Then, there was lots of debate about the setting of the inputs (time window used to capture the first 3 bars) and a few of us even attempted to back test the system. Since that time a few souls have continued with some interesting concepts (which I seem too stupid to understand) and it also seems that the originator has left the scene.... But even after all this, I have found myself drawn back to the original concept. I respect those of us who can understand all sorts of fancy lines, indicators, and MTF charts. But I need something very simple so that I can make my 10 to 15 pips a day (and then use the magic of compounding to reach "freedom"). So, here are my thoughts after spending many, many, many hours of trying "this and that": It is best to never lose sight of the fact that "the trend is our friend" and that most of these these pairs do have a "break out" of some sort after the start of London trading. With the above in mind, I started thinking about ways to place these "break out" trades with some sort of "compass" that would only allow me to enter "high probability" trades. Here is what I am doing: 1) On 1 hour chart add original "Eagle" indicator with time inputs of 5 and 8 GMT. 2) Add the following MAs... 5 ema = Green, 12 ema = Red, 24 ema = Blue. 3) Add RSI (default setting of 21). Each morning (I live in EDT of USA) I get my sorry ass out of the rack at 05:00 (EDT) (09:00 GMT), open up the charts, and apply a pre-made template containing the above items. Then I scan the pairs looking for this magic combination..... Once spoted, I go to a 30 minute chart for a trigger to enter. VERY SIMPLE. Green, Red, and Blue lines are stacked in this EXACT order when price is near the break out point of the "Eagle box". I get a further confirmation from RSI and enter . Long = GREEN, RED, BLUE in decending order and RSI is over the 50 level (pointing up). Short = is opposite of above. My problem is coming up with an acceptable SL. Any suggestions would be very helpful. If we can find a way to have an acceptable level of risk in order to have a high probability of making our daily quota of pips......We could all end up on "easy street" . All comments welcome (good and bad) and it would be great if Eagle returned with the other ideas that he had mentioned. Thanks for reading.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Skygod, Eagle hasn't left the scene. He's spending his pips on holiday I agree, don't overcomplicate. But are we overcomplicating? Eagle is a nice concept. But not perfect. (nothing ever will be) So we start looking for improvements. You want to go back to basics. But are you really doing that? No. You are trying to build a compass. Absolutely nothing wrong with that. But is not the original concept anymore. And your aim is exactly the same as that of Spiritbreezer. She tries to filter out the (potential) bad trades. You try exactly the same with "high probability". The only thing where Spiritbreezer has a high aim is the number of pips. She wants whenever possible earn some bonus pips on top of the 10 you aim at. And yes you are very right that a average 10 pip profit plus compounding will make you a very good income. (although 'good' is very subjective) The most important word in the previous sentence is 'average'. You win some and lose some. So your winners need to be bigger than 10 pips bring back the average to 10 pips. If you can guarantee 10 pips on every trade change your nick to Tradinggod... And even if your lifestyle requires 10 pips/day try to reach at least 100 pips a day and put the 90 on a savings account. Nothing guarantees that this system will still work after 10 year. If your setup works I wouldn't get out of bed that early What about a simple indicator that checks the setup, and if the setup is found play some sound. No sound = stay in the rack :-) I know a trader that works in a similar way. He has his PC connected to some amps and has speakers in most rooms of his house and in his garden. When a setup met all speaker start to bleep and he goes to his trading room. Sometimes he never gets in his room. Then he had a nice day in his garden. Nice story. But a very important one imo. Humans, even Skygods, need good sleep. You need to be fresh when analyzing charts. So you need to be out of bed more that 5 minutes before the box completes. GBPUSD H1 10,14,16 May -&gt; missed trades because of the filter. The filter seems to get confused at times without real direction in the market. Otherwise take a look how the EMAs can grab pips beyond the yellow target. The RSI doesn't seem to add much to the EMA filter. There are times it keeps us out of a bad trade. But also keeps out of winning trades. If a indicator performs medicore/neutral it just adds unwanted complexity. BTW none of the above was meant negative. (I can't express myself very well in English...) I want to complement you on your compass. at first sight is looks very good and simple to use.

Hi, I have read all post in this thread, the system seems to be good. congratulation Eagle. I just cant seem to get the timing right. Does it matter what time zone i am? or I just need ensure the indicator start 3 hour before &amp; end 1 hour after the opening session. Do I need to modify the timing to other opening session as well ? for example 3 hour before New York to 1 hour after? 3 hour before Tokyo to 1 hour after? 3 hour before London to 1 hour after? Thanks

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Look here: http://www.forexmarkethours.com/ Or download the small program at the bottom of that page. Check the current London time and compare it to your current chart time. Your red Eagle box has to end when London opens. Don't worry if that 4AM or 11PM on your chart. The only thing that matters is that your red box ends on the right time! The easiest way is just to try until it is right. The timings in this thread are for GBPUSD. If your want to trade another pair you need to find session setting for that pair. http://www.wharton.co.uk/time_zone_clocks/474_057.htm http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ http://www.arachnoid.com/lutusp/worldclock.html http://www.worldtimezone.com/ http://www.qlock.com/time/gmaps

The Red Eagle box end at London open or extend 1 hour into London open? for example London open 8pm my local time, so Red Box end at 8 pm or 9 pm.. I like trading GBP/JPY so which time is good ? end the redbox at Tokyo open time right?

--- 帖子 #366 ---
At open or 1 hour after open. It's a personal preference. As I understand the original rules the red box must end 1 second before London opens. So if you are on H1 and London opens 8:00 pm on your chart then the end time is 7:00 7:00 + H1 candle = 8:00 Personally I feel extending the box 1 hour may avoid some false breakouts. GBPJPY I really don't know what's best. But because the London and Tokyo sessions almost don't overlap I would investigate both opens.

Hi Traderseven and Icfxtrader, Sorry for the delay in responding, I was out and about all weekend. Traderseven, I am greatful for your feed back of my observations...never any offense taken . Yes, you are correct...my plan for a "compass" has flaws but I was trying to take advantage of "the trend" as a way to comfirm making the tade. Over the past 4 years I have studied everything from candles to fibs to S/R to wave theroy to news trading...most of it is "hocus pocus" and only works because the "market" believes that it works (which is all that matters). I would be more than happy to hear your ideas about a simple compass. I respect you for adding some input . @ Icfxtrader....I will attach a chart that will show you what I was talking about. Glad this thread has come back to life! Also, it is wonderful to see Eagle back on the scene (although I have no idea what he is saying....we lazy Americans somtimes forget that English is the the only language in the world)

Skygod, all Another trend confirmation idea you might like. It's a little more responisve as your idea. It's not perfect (obviously). Just see what you like best. Long: EMA(20,Close) &gt; EMA(21,Open) Short: EMA(20,Close) &lt; EMA(21,Open) Neutral: EMA(20,Close) = EMA(21,Open) =&gt; you will see extend periods of this. When checking things manually it can often be hard to see what the EMAs would have done during the buildup of the bar. That's why I both shift them by 1.

I am having big trouble making this indicator work on New York open time. in my MetaTrader. NorthFinance shows New York open today at 23.00 while in marketiva shows 5am I use this indicator in MetaTrader so making the indicator start at 21.00 end at 23.59 and box end 16.00 make it goes backways .. and if make boxend 05:00 also goes backways.. where am i wrong here ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #373 ---
It's of no importance when New York opens. You only need to know when London open. On your MT4. The timezone where you live in is of zero importance. Only MT4 time is what counts. Probably stating the obvious but when I say London open I don't mean the 1st bar after the weekend but the time the bank people start to work/trade. They start 2:30 from now. I don't have North Finance but if it really opens at 23:00 and it's the time on your charts not on your watch then London opens at 18:00 The timezone your charts are in is GMT+10 (Vladivostok) London is GMT+0

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Yes the time was not correct on my metatrader, i download new &amp; install from fxopen. the time is correct now. I also confused Asian open time to US open time, my mistake . Set the indicator to correct time now. waiting ..... 1 more thing, I do have the BreakOut_0600_0900_EAGLE__indicator.ex4 do i need the other MG4 file as well ?

I came accross the attached Indicator to draw lines on your chart at certain levels, problem is it always draws lines in round numbers. Is it possible for somebody to change the indicator to allow user input for a value you want the indicator to use as starting point, say 2.1125 then the indicator calculate the grid values from this input? Regards

"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex and more violent. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction" Albert Einstein My view... Keep it very simple... My variation to this: 1. I take the height of the box 2. Divide to 3 so we have 3 numbers x1, x2, x3 3. TP levels are BO + x1, x2, x3 4. Enter with 4 units. 5. Leave the 4th unit till the end of the period (box length) 6. When BO+x2 executed move to BE 7. SL is half of the box or the other side depending how aggressive is the method

Hi all, Very interesting thread. I live in the EDT zone and cannot get up in the middle of the night to trade so I would have to trade the New York open. Does this system only work during the London open or would it also work during the New York open? Is there anyone here who trades the NY open? Thanks Pips to you. Jbone

Hi all Very nice thread ... i will add this system - breakout - in my PeptoScalp_ea_v01

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi, Perhaps someone can help me. I'm new to MT4. I added the breakout indicator to my MT4 and I just happened to right click on the chart. The box that opens usually has "new order" at the top but it is now replaced with "expert advisors". This happens on all the charts I open even though I only added the breakout indicator to one chart. I added the indicator to experts/indicators in my MT4. Was this correct or is this causing the problem? How can I get the "new order" to appear again? I have deleted the indicator from MT4 but this did not help. The "new order" option on the toolbar does not work either. Many thanks Jbone

I am assuming by upload you mean to make it work on your chart. To make this indicator work, because it is a compiled program and not source code. This is how I do it. This goes for any MT4 indicator, not just this one. 1. down load it from FF to Program Files/ Your Broker name/ experts/ indicators. for example, my broker name is for charting MT4 is Strategybuilderfx. So mine would be ProgramFiles/Strategybuildefx/experts/indicators 2 now that the ex4 compiled indicator is in the indicator folder on your computer, go ahead and start your Metatrader. If you already had it running, close it and restart it. 3 Now open the navagator window from the view menu at the top. 4 now select the indicator by it's name from the list of custom indicators that are listed after the experts. 5. Now left click on ithat indicator and keep holding down the click key and drag the indicator onto the chart. 6. now set the inputs the way you want them and click ok. the proceedure is exactly the same for the source code version, because when you shut of mt4 and restart it it automatically compiles all source code files in all the folders... If you need more help, just PM me and I will talk to on the phone about it on my 800 number. Thanks hope that helps

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Just my 2 cents. A system with a fix SL and fix TP definitely a losing system. If the TP &lt; SL, then no need to argue, you will loss. If the TP &gt; SL, then you need a system with at least 50% winning ratio or you will loss/break event on a long run. I believe a breakout system will have 50% winning ratio only if you set the SL=TP. So in a long run, I believe this system will result a break event or event a loss because the spread. BUT, you can improve you winning chance using this system by set your SL fix and having a dynamic TP (a trailing stop that allow your profit run) and only place one type of order (only BUY and never SELL, or only SELL and never BUY)which match with the trend. And then your question will be "what SL and what kind of a trailing stop ?" and "How to determine trend" You need to find it by your self.

You need to brush up on your math. The expected payoff of a system is computed this way- (Average win/Average Loss * win%) - loss%

Dear Eagle; Your Breakout System is simple fine system that works also very well. I decided to report my own Experience. Pairs : EUR/JPY GBP/USD GBP/JPY USD/CHF AUD/USD USD/JPY All with good results everyday but USD/JPY need other Time frame. If you use 06:00 to 09:00 (GMT+2) , then switch to 05:00 to 08:00 for better results with backtest confirmed by me. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 06:00 to 09:00 means 04:00 to 07:00 GMT or 05:00 to 08:00 London because london is GMT+1 now in the summer. So Sync your Metatrader with these details. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Use Triple CCI woodies as your Second Indicator . (Trend CCI50 and Entry CCI:14 ) Activate "Fractal" Indicator. Use Moving Average Indicator with Following Setting. 1. Period=50 Shift=0 MA method= Simple Apply to=Close Style=RED 2. Period=20 Shift=0 MA method= Exponential Apply to=Close Style=Yellow. Conditions : IF fractals Occure During the redbox and the TrendCCI50 &gt; 0 then the Breakout occur on upper side of the Box. but if the TrendCCI50 changed to less than 0 or weak , then it may go Down. Also , If the EntryCCI 14 is less than 0 then it is harder to break the box when the Trend CCI 50 &gt; 0. I try to make a Document , but it is working 100%. Riguardo FATTO...

Hey guys sorry for the language used, and pyramid i really owe you mate ur triple cci is perfect and offcourse the breakout eagle indicator which earned me 40 odd pips 2day thnx cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
First off, I read this thread from beginning and gracias for a nice and neat system senior Eagle! Thanks also to everyone who contributed here. Secondly bksujal, its just that when someone repeatedly posts questions with big fonts it can get a little annoying especially for people who spend a lot of time on forums and come across a lot of people who do this. Anyways, in response to your question, and from my personal experience, you should use CCI14 and CCI50 together in taking your trades if you want to use the triple CCI...Pyramid here just explained about it but I'll try to make it more clear. The CCI50 is an overall trend indicator. Take zero as a level if CCI50 is above it, this indicates we have something like a trend to the upside. CCI14 is a faster trigger, however, this does not mean you ignore it. With both CCI's above zero, its a stronger trend to the upside, and the box is broken easily. On the other hand, having CCI50 above zero and CCI14 below makes the box harder to break, thus there failed attempts to break the box, triggering some false signals as perfectly demonstrated by the chart pyramid uploaded. Its not a matter of which line is more important than the other, its about using both indicators together to help you in making a trade decision. I realize your question was aimed at pyramid but I thought I might pitch in to help.....greetings from Dubai!

--- 帖子 #455 ---
The use of indicator is as follows: Indicator draws a box capturing the high and low of the price for the given time frame and number of candles. Particularly this indicator monitors high and low from 5am to 8am, London time so just set the time this will be on your brokers time in the parameters of the indicator. Indicator draws a box, keeping those high and low in memory for the rest of the day or given time period (for this example it's 23:00 or 11PM). When price breaks out of the given high or low, you accordingly must buy or sell depending on which side of the box was penetrated (high or low). This indicator works most especially on these following pairs: AUD/USD EUR/GBP EUR/USD GBP/USD USD/CAD USD/CHF USD/JPY This a good example of how to enter a trade with the indicator: For a high breakout (this is when there is a breakout on top of the box) GBPUSD 2.0330 entry. Put your take profit at 2.0340 plus the brokers spread =2.0343 and Stop Loss 2.0315. For low breakout GBPUSD 2.0307 entry, take profit at 2.0297 minus broker’s spread = 2.0295 and then put your stop loss at 2.0322. It is a easy strategy don’t know why people are confused. I got this from past post. Have fun

I'm so sorry, I'm soo stupid, I know It's been asked most time, but it still confuse me. could some one tell me the correct time to capture the box?

We follow London session which is, as i understand, GMT+1....... If your broker is using GMT+1, Then there's nothing to change on the default time (5:00 to 8:00)....... If your broker is North Finance which is GMT+3 then you have to change the default time from 5 to 8 to 7:00 to 10:00...... Alpari is GMT+2, So it should be 6:00 to 09:00 in order to catch the previous 3-hour bars. Other: I understand the OPEN_FIBO should be loaded to the chart twice. First set is TRUE on the UP parameter. 2nd set is FALSE.......... I'm sure there's still something not clear to me. Just my 2 cents. Thanks. Rene

--- 帖子 #485 ---
February of this year to be exact... There was a nice thread started here at FF called Box Breakout indicator . There was much development of it and many varieties are available in this directory and this one also that are resource directories of the ForexFactory "London Calling" thread . I've spent some time reading from the first post to #484 above. The funny thing is someone in the L.C. thread PM'd me months ago and said basicaly i should have named the thread "10 pips a day guranteed" or similar and the masses would have come. LOL. Way to funny looking at what has taken place here. OK, my 2 pips worth. TraderSeven brought up a good point when he mentioned that waiting until 1 hour after session open might filter out some false moves, this is what my live account testing has also shown me. I will state right here that i quit trading the L.O. last May as it was taking time away from family (i'm in Oregon USA), but knew enough in testing to believe that a heavy amount of discretion (for me anyway) is needed to make this a profitable trading model. If i stopped my box at 1 hour BEFORE the L.O. i lost miserable due to many "German Headfakes" as we used to call them. If i stopped the box right at open i would get some good gains, but needed to often close the trade before the London morning news. IF i waited for the box to close at 08:59 London and waited for a breakout of that are over the course of the trading day, most likely i would gain those 10 pips (actualy i let it run and set it to break even once things had gone past 20 pips setting it to BE+5). Also, and this is a quick post script edit/comment. There are some posts of mine that mention what we used to call here on the west cost "The Midnight Express". This was simply taking note of the 00:30 (Twelve Thirty West Coast Time) candle which corresponded to the 08:30 candle in London and taking the direction of the candle. I found that taking the candle that began and 08:30 and ended at 08:59 was often a better judge of the session's direction. Some rambles and food for thought. It always pleases me to see an old idea come to light and create excitement. I hope you have many pips in the bank as you experiment with this simple idea. Cheers, Thom

for the tips mate. I'm a newbie and anything that focusses me into the market and adds to my knowledge of its finer points is awesome. I like this particular indicator as one of a package of tools I am developing to stay in the market for as long as I can without getting square eyes. This one gives me a point of reference as each of the FX the zones gets underway each day....being a newbie, that was something of an issue for me. FF is pretty cool as forums go, very helpful.

Thanks for those links Thom. I'm going to look if they contain some idea's that a useful for Eagle. Are you referring to LO/Eagle or just any 'morning breakout system'? I think I found even better times. Draw a red box at 23:00-03:00 GMT That box setup filters out a lot of fake breakouts that only last 4 pips and then take out your stops. It not only reduces the false spikes but also sets you up for a better starting point that very often reaches between 30 and 50 pips. And that suits me better. I really like Eagle. 10 pips a day for sure is great too. But when taking everything into account risk, spread, slippage, losers, etc for me personally its RR is to low. With a higher target things get much better. Ideas that still follow the Eagle indicator. The biggest problem is filtering the fakes and letting the winners run. If you look at a H1 chart and the candle that breaks the 30 pip target is &gt;25 pips then there is a good chance for grabbing 50 pips. Only take trades in the direction of that candle.... Another thing to look at Well that's enough for one post. Now I'll just wait and see if this thread gets up to steam again. Lets make Eagle fly!

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks for the cooments TS. This was specificaly what a group of us found when trading a similar morning breakout model during the summer of 2005 through fall of that year. I've seen on session-open B.O. model that waited even longer than the 03:00 GMT and were gaining some nice trades. Here is the position (pun intended) that i take on breakouts, and this would include (for myself) B.O.s in any of their various forms such as Carter's "Box Play", the "Midnite Express", or the lot (LOL more pun fotter) of them: As our fellow trader mbqp11 says "Be vewwwy quiet. I'm hunting stops." In general, its dangerous out there in the market to start with, and basing a model on a supposed breakout, and then adding to that (for some B.O. models) a very low pip target OR low RR may prove to be futile in the long term. In several of Eagle's posts he does mention moving his stops and letting it run, and i believe i saw at least a handful of reported pip gains that were in excess of 20 or so pips each. And THAT in my opinion is a good thing, and something that should be further researched. Back to Eagle. May it bring in some simple &amp; consistent pips for you. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Apologies for sounding stupid if I do but do you configure the red box to commence at 23, cross the midnight line and run up to 3 AM GMT. Could you elaborate please. I'ld be much obliged mate.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Dear fellows, I just want to know, did anybody just put a buy/sell stop order with TP+10 or manually put the order and watch the CCI indicator? Is it really works?? thanks...

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Did the latter 4 times, watched my indicators and hey presto...it worked! Now I don't believe there are any guarantees in life cept death and taxes but this baby is worth watching.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Have you ever tried to stop the box 1 hour before LO and then ignore all action for an hour to avoid the headfakes? That way you have the box you want without being faked.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi, Had anyone posted a fully functional EA for this system that can be used in a live account ? Thx.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
You may check Post #173 of this thread. But I am of the view that the EA needs further fine tuning.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hey everybody. I have been following this thread since the beginning and I know people have different views on this but I was wondering what SL do you tend to use with this system. I know some people are running it without a stop loss and some people are using 15 pips. Could someone clarify this matter please. Thanks and God Bless.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Hi, Can anyone please explain or guide me how to draw the lines explained in red in the above post (Post No. 316) ?. I tried the fibo drawing tool in MT4 but it does not draw lines where we can specify 360 or 180 or 50 pips interval. Thanks, TS

--- 帖子 #498 ---
can you guys give me an idea of what S/L you are all using? i am finding that 15 pip s/l is hit quite a bit. If I have a higher s/l than a t/p, that might lead to an unbalanced system tilted towards the losing side. thanks.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
All of my trades were GBP using this indicator. I do not trade blindly everyday. You have to analyze price and news. I use a stop loss of 50 pips. Only 1 time my stop loss got triggered. If price move in my direction for 25 pips, I use trailing stop 20 pips. Depending on situation, sometimes I just manually close trade if I will not be able to monitor in front of computer. If price movement is strong in my direction or news favor my trade, I let it run. Usual pips are 10 to 50 (less spread &amp; commission) but highest I was able to close was 100+. At the moment, I wouldn't recommend using this indicator since the chance of losing is now high bec. GBP movement is like crazy.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
For the last 3 trading days, this system is on a roll. Hope it will sustain its momentum like before . This is the most profitable system I have encountered used along with BAT.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
hey qwert, are you straddling the range or picking a direction to play? thanks.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Vder, to make it very simple, just open trade in the direction where price breaks the box.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Vder, for me, I think that one should have many proven systems or strategies. You should have tried them many times before and have a high percentage of win. What I mean is that there are many great systems out there. But they do not always work since markets changes behavior. When current strategy is working poorly, try your other strategies by backtesting first(even for the last 1 or 2 weeks of data) and see if which strategy is more successful for current market. At least this is what I do and it usually works.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Another italian on this 3d Someone can help me posting the hi-lo value for EUR/USD or GBP/USD for tomorrow 21/09/07 ? I'm living in Brazil and i'm just confused about time zone Grazie

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hakuna, you'll only know the hi-lo of the day "ON THE DAY ITSELF" before the opening of London market. That means you have to monitor even for just 1 min before opening of London market to know the hi-lo. Re time, you just have to know what time your MT4 broker use as the start of the day. My broker's start time is GMT+0, so I set the indicator time at periodBegin=0500 and periodEnd=0700. Some examples, if broker's start time is GMT+3, periodBegin=0800 and periodEnd=1000. If broker's start time is GMT-2, periodBegin=0300 and periodEnd=0500. This strategy is a no brainer and surprisingly very profitable most of the time. Just this week, all profit daily with total +323pips. Although very stressful since you have to monitor for many hours. I trade only GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Thanks Qwert I've the same time of Italian time zone (GMT+1) so i need to set 6:00-8:00 right? Is there any way to set another broker start time on MT4? I'd like it to set it to GMT+0 so i don't make any error about time.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hakuna, your time set is correct. You can't change starting time of broker. It is fixed unless they are the ones who change the starting time to GMT+0, or you find another broker. Anyway, even though brokers have the same starting time like GMT+0, they usually do not have the same price feeds. One reason is one may have an advance/late time of i.e. 2 mins. Even if 2 mins is only a short period of time, if price changes rapidly during these 2 mins, two brokers' opening/closing prices will have a huge difference.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Read and tested, looks great

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thanks for explanation. Just one more question, are you using the Eagle rules (10+spread TP , SL 12 ) or another TP SL rules?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hakuna, I don't use Eagle's rules of T/P &amp; S/L anymore. Just his indicator. You can just look back at the data/price and you'll know T/P is much much more. S/L of 12 is too tight. Safer is 50 pips if you can't monitor. I remember Eagle indicated he doesn't use S/L. Since everyone kept on asking about his S/L, he just said 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks Eagle.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #513 ---
tx Eagle for the breakout method, I made 10 pips on all 6 pairs that I trade today. GU, EU, UY, UC, GY &amp; EC. I read through the whole thread more than once, maybe I'm stupid but I could not found consensus on the Begin and end time for the 3 hour period. Eagle said in one post that the begin time is 3 hours before London open, so my last bar is the one just before London open - 3am to 6am GMT, my time GMT+2.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
okkkkkkkkk

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Voleva sapere da te qual'è l'orario che usi per calcolare il massimo e minimo. La prima barra è quella delle 3am e l'ultima delle 6am (ora inglese), quindi in totale 4 barre?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Eagle, could you please send me this information? It all looks great...and who couldnt use 10 pips a day?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
esattamente.totale quattro barre. grazie inglese sono zero

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Eagle uses the indicator set on "start time 06:00" "end time 09:00" and he's on GMT+1 , so you need to set the indicator on 07:00 10:00, 4 bars. QWERT uses only 3 bars, so your time should be 07:00 09:00. Bye

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Tx Hakuna and Eagle I used Babel fish to translate It wanted to know from you qual' is the timetable that it uses in order to calculate the maximum and minimum. The first bar is that one of 3am and the last one of 6am (the English hour), therefore in total 4 bars I just want to know, do I set the last bar to 1hour before London open, thus it stops measuring ON London open In that case GMT +2 would be 4am GMT to 7am GMT, 4 bars but it end on [9am GMT +2] which is London open at [8am GMT+1]. Basically, does this indicator work so that it Stops at London Open, I think if we can get that figured out then the time zone would not be such a problem. All just need to set their indicator to stop at 1 hour before London. Once again tx for the pips Eagle, and the explanations by all

--- 帖子 #521 ---
The time for one hour b4 London open should be (GMT) 7am. As what I've learned from babypips.com, London open is at (GMT)8 a.m. My broker time zone is GMT+3, therefore 08:00 + 3:00 = 11:00, therefore I set the periodBegin=08:00(3 hrs b4 London open), PeriodEnd=11:00. That's what I've learned from Eagle's posts. I might be wrong so correct me.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hopefully Babelfish got it right Desidero appena sapere, io regolo l'ultima barra a 1 ora prima che Londra aperta, così smette di misurare su Londra aperta

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Babelfish sucks Do you see the red box of eagle's indicator? The right red line must be on London opening time, for me it's on 9AM for you should be on 10AM (GMT+1) and for maxcruiver is on 11AM (GMT+2). On the indicator set "Period Begin" to 5:00AM then add the difference with GMT, "Period End" to 8:00AM then add the difference with GMT. I hope my english is better than italian of babelfish

--- 帖子 #524 ---
tx Hakuna, an better explanation I could not have asked for &amp; hopefully I did not swear at anyone with that translation

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Not to worry to you approximately babelfish, it is simply amusing to see the own language massacred from a program therefore like I am making now with yours using babelfish in order translate from the Italian English

--- 帖子 #526 ---
so true btw, I'm just waiting for EU to give me my 10 pips today... made 10 on GY, UC, GU, EC, and cancelled UY, as I was to late for that one, but could have taken it if I look back

Wow Thanks a lot for you amazing system eagle. I thought of a great idea to backtest it. Is it possible to make an additional red rectangle of 10 pips above and below the Breakout points to know if it did give you the 10 pips. Thanks

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Change the color to "none" -- that will take it off

Hello there, You can easily change the range of the indicator by hitting "Ctrl + I" or right clicking on the chart and hitting Indicators. http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/9297/22513200ia6.gif Just change the periodBegin to periodEnd to whatever you like it to be. Hope this helped.

This strategy, seems really nice. Well done Eagle. Has anyone done some backtesting on it? If so can you post the results? Has anyone got a decent EA? Comments appreciated!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Any news about 5 pips eagle system ?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi everyone, Because I had a feeling that this system could work and no one came up with a decent EA, I decided to back-test this strategy by hand. I tested the pairs, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/JPY, EUR/CHF, USD/CHF, GBP/JPY and GBP/CHF. I only tested the first trade of each day and compared 3 Stop Loss placement strategy: 1. 15 pips away from entry; 2. Outside the Box (If long 1 pip below low of box, If short 1 pip above high of box); 3. Above or below High/Low of previous candle. The results were quite good but far from spectacular. So I decided to filter the trades. For each pair, on the Daily and Weekly charts I plotted a 200 period Exponential Moving Average. The filter was as follows: - Only took Long trades : when price was above the 200 EMA on both charts; - Only took Short trades : when price was below the 200 EMA on both charts; - Long and Short trades were taken when price was above the 200 EMA on on chart and below on the other. The improvement was spectacular, there was an overall improvement of about 51 %. Included is a word doc. with the results. Comments would be much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hey thats a pretty nice filter. My question to you is how far back in time did you go when backtesting. Thanks

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I started the Back test on the first trading day of July - 02/07/2007 and the last day included in the test was 24/10/2007 Thanks for your comment, if you have more questions feel free to ask!

Dear friends: you are welcome, i just experienec the system today, and i made 10 pips. We can study together. I think it is better to explore the tread from the first .

--- 帖子 #588 ---
The only indicator u need is just the breakout located on the first page. The other ones are just extras.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Different Brokers will display different times. My previous chart is from North Finance so depending on who you are using it might appear different. The time thing was beat to death earlier so if you care to get into that you could re read the thread. I placed the indicator on my chart and I did move it around at first but then I just left it at the original default 5 to 8 which because of my Broker might make it differ from your setup. JMO but it is simply personal preference where you place it. Other than that I am just looking to trade the breakout in the direction of the prevailing trend, look to take a 20 pip profit, more if it is running. I only started looking at this yesterday so I'm just looking at a few indicators to come up with what I want to use with the box to give me an idea where price is and which direction &amp; how far it might be moving.

darko80, I put you on msn.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Maybe you should read at least the first page of the thread no ?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Right, I read and I understood about the method. But I'd like to have an explanation on why this works.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Ciao viandante, this siystem is really simple. It measures low and high from 5:00 to 8:00 (italian time, GMT+1), then you'll put 2 orders (one buy at the high and one sell at the low) with both a take profit of 10 + the spread your broker put on the gbp/jpy (if you trade it ).

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I understood that the indicator simply took the low and the high on a period of three hours and with a GMT+1 chart. The time is between 3 and 6 am. But why this works? It's really so easy?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Ok, sorry I was writing while you was answering me. So, you put an order when you go out of the box, is it right?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
YES RIGHT, it's not so easy, cause this is just forex but 10pips as TP is a safe strategy. It works really nice, but try it on demos first

--- 帖子 #601 ---
thanks!

the indicator time is above GMT+1 6:00-9:00 so GMT+0 is 5:00-8:00

open up the properties screen and go to common. Then uncheck show object descriptions at the bottom right. Mister ED

hello thanks for the post but i think it will be of more benefit if you can trow more light on the strategy in the sense that you did not talk about hw to identify the breakout. is it three candlestick of thesame colour or hw? pls do give the details so ALL can benefit. thanks

1. Thanks Mr Ed. You are right! 2. One more question about the indicator: I enclose a picture from the graph. Look at last rectangle, look at the arrow. The rectangle should cover all the bar at 05:00, but it didnt. How come?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
hey smilee, Actually the indicator does not use that bar in it's calculation. If you read some of the first 3 or 4 pages you will understand how it is calculated. (I think Bill posted a Clear description of that ) It actually does not use the left most bar but takes the next 3 bars to make up the box. That is if you use the indicator as presented. You CAN by changing the times in the inputs menu make the box use as many bars as you like BUT it will never use the Left Most bar in determining the breakout box. SO if you want the indicator to START with a specific bar you would want to have it draw the left hand line on the bar directly preceding the one you want.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
How do i make the change in the indicator exactly? the indicator should not compute the whole bar from 04:00. I want it from 05:00.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
O.K. I have looked at the indicator &amp; here is what I found. The chart below I have set the times in the input section to periodBegin: 07:00 periodEnd : 10:00 Now the Box begins at the Left edge aligned with the center line of the 07:00 candle and ends on the right edge passing through the center line of the 10:00 candle. If you look at the box however it's parameters are drawn using only the last 3 candles, the 08:00 , 09:00, and the 10:00 candles. The 07:00 candle is clearly NOT within the box. SO if you want the box to reflect from and INCLUDING 05:00 to 07:00 you should enter 04:00 to 07:00 in the input boxes. The 04:00 bar WOULD NOT be used in drawing the box in this example.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
You are right! Thanks alot.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Can anyone pls tell me how can i setup for the time?im using interbankfx and now im in aus.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
If I am not mistaken your broker IBFX is on GMT+0 time. London open is 08:00 gmt + 0 The fact that you live elsewhere makes no difference (other than to your sleep) Your chart should say 08:00 when it is 08:00 in London. ( I could be wrong please verify) Determine when you want the breakout box to be &amp; set accordingly. Remember that you set it one hour BEFORE you want the box to begin. (ie a 4 hour spread will give you a 3 hour box, so a setting of 05:00 to 08:00 would give you a box beginning at 6 a.m. ending at 07:59:59 am. (i think http://www.2007.worldmarkethours.com.../Defaulta.htm?

I absolutely love this trading system, I been using it for quite some time now and what I do is simply "set it and forget it" with a 15pip trailing stop

--- 帖子 #632 ---
dear eagle, I found a lot of system here. I am too late here to post my comment. Eagle i want to tell you something. Whenever somebody tell me that a new good system is started here on FF. I take a look. Problem is if there are too many posts on thread, it make u confuse only thread runner know where is his system is going. Please EDIT your 1 post every time with latest indicator and information(related to timeframe,entry,stoploss and target ) so their is no need to read all posts of thread. I have read 29 page in 1 hour and now have headache. Iam not english. Please eagle just do that. Thanks

this thread appears to have died prematurely. Skyline - did your SRDC3 EA not have legs? or do you not believe in the strategy? Forward testing manually the last week has been positive on cable, but suffered whipsaws on GBPJPY.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
one simple filter would be only place trades in direction of 5SMA.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I still think the indicator repaints itself so I'll have to place lines manually from now on.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Happy Christmas and many gains...

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Thanks Eagle This is still a very good system. Wished someone would come up with an EA for this system.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
This is a very interesting concept, and it inspired me to do something I rarely do: read the entire thread (all 44 pages!) After a little study, I've decided to do some testing, with the following customizations... 1. The box will end at 18:00, not 23:00 (same time zone as Eagle's), because most movement is over by then. 2. Timeframe = M15 3. Use LSMA Slope for confirmation (period = 6) 4. Open a trade for each bar that crosses a box boundary from the inside out (breakouts), long for upside breakouts, short for downside breakouts. 5. Open a trade at the open of each bar that is outside the box, if the direction of the LSMA Slope agrees, long for bars that open above the box, short for bars that open below the box. 6. SL and TP TBD by experimentation. 7. The size of each trade will be small, because of the strategy of opening many trades at once.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Looks like anice filter DGG. Can you please post LSMA. There are many versions of that indicator and I want to be sure that I'm looking at the same indicator as you do. http://www.forexmt4.com/_MT4_Indicators/ What value for slope do you consider best? Thanks for sharing your idea.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
That is the classic Eagle rule. You enter on the breakout and then add to your position for every bar that openens outside the box? Regardless how much the price has moved? Somehow I think you don't have a fixed target like Eagle does. Besides that a 10 pip profit is very small (I use 30) some trades will be so close to the fixed exit that they don't even recover spread. Is your target purely discretionary? I 'use' the enclosed LSMA. Look for a slope in the right direction. Yellow should be considered weak.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
The picture shows false bearish breakouts followed by a bullish breakout. GBPUSD, H1, Target 30 pips Short entry: 1- Price crosses below the box. 2- LSMA is red. Long entry: 1- Price crosses above the box. 2- LSMA is green. Applying the above would have kept us out of the short trade because LSMA was yellow, green but never red. Long exit: 1- Exit when you hit the target. 2- If the LSMA color turns yellow watch your stops/trade carefully. 3- If the LSMA color turns red then the breakout was a fake afterall. Take profits! 4- If LSMA turns yellow and turns down act as if it turned red. ----------------------------------------- As I wrote I use a 30 pip target. That requires more power from the breakout. So when aiming for that target you must play according to the rules mentioned above. But the short breakout would have taken the 10 pip + spread traget. So an additional short rule could be: Short entry#2: 1- Price crosses below the box. 2- LSMA is yellow. 3- LSMA is sloping down. (not almost flat) 4- Change target to 12 pips. Above I wrote about colors changing during a trade. If colors can make us exit earlier why not keep us in longer. Say we took the 'yellow trade' and during teh trade the LSMA turns red. I would change the target to 30 then. With care!!!

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I've been using the 5SMA a trend filter and only placing orders at the box boundary in the direction of the MA. TP50, SL at other side of box. Still prone to whipsaws but good MM this one is a winner.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Can you please post that indicator? Or do you mean teh standard 5 bar MA? In that case Simple or Smooothed?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
simple 5

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I have shown the LSMA Slope, not LSMA.. See attachment for the code which I modified to give a slope value. I haven't tested this concept yet, so I don't know what would work best. The parameters would change over time as the nature of the market shifted anyway. I chose 6 by a quick look at the charts; as a starting point for further research.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Yes, I included all the rules I want to use for completeness, even if they are the same as Eagle's original concept. Yes. It's a probabilistic approach, based on the idea that an indicator signal identifies a time period within which the probability of price movement is greater in one direction than the other. According to the Law of Large Numbers, the sample size must be large for the actual result to be similar to the expected outcome. A single trade for each signal does not provide a sufficiently large sample to take full advantage of the probability asymmetry identified by the indicator signal. As I mentioned above, I haven't performed any tests on this idea yet (for this indicator, anyway). When I do, the crucial parameters will be determined by optimization. I like the LSMA a lot (though my current favorite MA is HMA...), but I'm leary of using the color changes because they are changed after the fact (repainted). Essentially they just indicate the slope of the indicator - in a fairly crude fashion - so I simply re-modeled the indicator to give just that; the slope of the original MA.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
This system needed a fresh set of eyes. I am doing very well with this system and I was hoping that it could be improved. Thanks for your help guys

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Dear DGC, Good luck with your testing. Looking forward to the results. And thanks in advance for sharing. My best to you and yours, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #659 ---
do you have any variations on the eagle rules? A different TP/SL perhaps?

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Dear WHTenn, How have you personalized the system to make it successful for yourself? Thanks very much, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hey Cgldsmth and Lenoxer, this is what my chart looks like. I added the XPMA indicator and the Parabolic indicator. I am attaching pics of their settings and the indicator XPMA for you. The Parabolic is part of your mt4 standard indicator package. I have not varied by Eagle's rules, I just tweaked the system by using the above indicators Reference to yesterdays box breakout that started to go short at 10:00 for a few pips but the XPMA and Parabolic indicators did not agree. I did not take the short. At 1400, the breakout occured and this time the XPMA and Parabolic agreed with the trend and I jumped it. Can you think of another way to make this system better? All I want is 20 pips. I trade with big lots.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
looks great WHTenn. A very nice filter you have there. I'm going to forward test live with nanolots for 2 months, but using TP and SL around psychological round numbers to see if it can yield fewer stops. An excellent New Year to you.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi WHT, Please explain what you mean by "XPMA and Parabolic agree"? How do they agree? Thanks Herty

--- 帖子 #664 ---
XPMA Description: XPMA is a trending indicator that will show you the current trend Blue=down, Red=up and Yellow= sideways Parabolic SAR Description:The Parabolic SAR (stop-and-reversal) is a time/price trend following system used to set trailing price stops. The Parabolic SAR provides excellent exit points. Forex traders using this technical indicator should close long positions when the price falls below the SAR and close short positions when the price rises above the SAR. If you are long (i.e., the price is above the SAR), the SAR will move up every day, regardless of the direction the price is moving. The amount the SAR moves up depends on the amount that currency rates move. I hope that this helps. Wishing you a Happy and Prosperous New Year

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hello WHT I think you mean Blue= up and Red=down?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
I just read through the whole thread. It's very simple but effective. Many thanks to eagle, WHTenn and all for your contribution in this system. Still one simple question before I have a test. Does the GMT 5:00-8:00 include the first hour of London or not? If yes, it counts up to and include the first hour of London open in the High-Low. If not, it only counts up to the the first hour of Frankfurt. That would be less confusing to me. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Great catch Pipo, thanks a bunch Pipal, to get a better understanding and an answer to your question, check out the answers given by Eagle. Actually, pm him and he will send you the correct settings for the indicator Good Luck

--- 帖子 #668 ---
I just started looking at the Eagle breakout system recently but using a Slope direction line instead of the XPMA. My question is, on the chart shown in post # 664 your indicators changed direction during the breakout period, would you have made the trade to the short side at the end of the box?

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I look at the overall trend using 4hr and daily charts. I then look at the xpMA indicator for direction and then Parabolic SAR. Yesterdays chart would be an excellent example of what to do when in doubt rather than the one you were looking at. Using the below chart for a reference. EUR/USD Hourly A.....Did not jump in, breakout to below but xpMA showed an upward movement. Parabolic SAR was above. B.....Took short, xpMA changed for a downward movement, Parabolic SAR agreed. C.....xpMA changed color to yellow, Parabolic SAR still indicated a downward movement. I remained short. D.....xpMA changed line color back to red, Parabolic SAR still indicated a downward movement. I remained short... xpMA went downward in color but changed to yellow in color then changed back to red for a continuation in movement. Parabolic SAR indicated a downward movement all along. Trading this could have resulted in over 120 pips if you rode this out. All I want is my 25 pips... no more, no less. Mission accomplished!!

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I added the XPMA and SAR indicators to my charts with the same setting you posted earlier but I get a different picture. I assume this is caused because I’m using a different signal feed than you and may be the reason other systems people claim work, doesn’t seem to work for me. Looking back at the other charts you have posted it seems like I would still get basically the same entry points as you do using this system. On the prior day in your example the price broke out early and you made your 25 pips and then the price reentered the box and broke out again. Would you have traded the second breakout too?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
the way I trade this it the 25 pip mark, close 80%, let rest ride, moving original stop up, and trail. My 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
I just enter and trade once a day using this pair. I trade three different platforms and three different systems. I really don't have time to watch it other than the breakout. You may see a difference if you don't use FXDD. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #674 ---
This has appeal... interesting way to trade. Very good idea actually. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #675 ---
WHTenn, This filter is a great idea. I think there will be almost zero failed trades. Have a question on eagle indicator Are they different for each currency pairs. Could you share the one you are using. Also would you know what time should I be setting for the box, given I use FXDD metatrader. Thanks much TradeStar

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi..I am using the setting on post 661, on this page. I am testing it on another pair at this time. I need to read this thread all over again to see what other currency pairs others have tested this system on.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
I use FXDD time 06:00 09:00 20:00 with Slope direction line instead of XPMA (seems to give close to same results as XPMA) and if it appears that the breakout bar will reverse the SAR then I still make the trade even if its the wrong direction at the time. I just finished testing on EUR/JPY selling 2 units @ breakout SL set @ 30pips TP on 1 unit @ 30 pips, if hit move SL on 2nd unit to break even and TP 30 pips higher. Also considering using Trailing stop on 2nd unit instead of TP. Results look good, Spreadsheet attached for EUR/USD and EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hello Abnormalone, tks for the spreadsheet reference. Can you enlighten what is the setting you used for the slope direction line? is the setting the same for both E/U and E/J?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Same for all pairs that I have been looking at so far. Slope Direction line Period=60 Method=3 price=0

--- 帖子 #680 ---
This is one very impressive spreadsheet. Can you post a chart for us? If you need software for screenshots, just shoot me a pm. It looks like your averaging 31 pips per trade. Are you using the same 6-9 setting on both pairs? This is great! Here is a Slope Direction Line indicator if anyone want to test it. I am adding it to my charts too! Change settings to reflect AbnormalOne's Period=60 Method=3 price=0 Update : I did a fast check on AbnormalOne's Slope Direction Line Indicator and I actually like it better than the XPMA on the EUR/USD pair. This is a great example of teamwork! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/buttons/quote.gif

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Another question to both Abnormalone &amp; WHTenn: using either XPMA or Slope direction line as filter, are you using 1Hr time frame to look for breakout only?

--- 帖子 #682 ---
I do not use the 4 hour chart for a reference. For example, look at 1 hour EUR/USD chart for 12/31. This is a clear short. Looking at the 4 hour chart, same pair for same time frame, it shows a long instead of a short. If you followed the 4 hour chart, it would have confused you and you probably would not trade since your getting two different directions with the Slope Direction Line. If you traded the 1 hour chart at the same time, you may have picked up 120 pips. Compare the two. You can trade with the trend of the 4 hour chart but you will not get as nearly the amount of pips as if you trade the 1 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Dear Thread, Following with interest. Thanks to everyone for their input. I use eSignal and not Metatrader. The eagle indicator doesn't seem to exist on eSignal---someone please enlighten me if it's there somewhere. At any rate, the indicator doesn't seem to be more than a "time box" of the high and low for a certain range of time. Could I simply mimic the indicator by drawing horizontal lines on my chart at the appropriate highs and lows and at the right times? And, would the Hull MA slope line be a good proxy for the trend lines you all are using? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Len - Yes you can. regards daytrading

--- 帖子 #685 ---
If you use shorter time frame you will have to change the 09:00 breakout time to 09:59 and the results may still vary by a small amount.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Using either indicator would have caught good EUR/JPY trade this morning. Trading 2 units, 1 TP @ 30 pips and 1 with 30 pip Trailing Stop would have nailed 150 pips minus spread

Can anyone tell me the difference between an EX4 file and a MetaQuotes Language 4 file? I am considering paying to have an EA written and they charge extra if they have to translate a file I can only find the Slope indicator in EX4 file type but there is a HMA indicator which seem to be the same as Slope that come in both file types and I am wondering if I should substitute it in order to save money

--- 帖子 #691 ---
I use the HMA indicator your speaking of with HMA period 8. I also have the slope direction line set at 60,3,0. For instance, when the slope direction indicator is displaying a nice downtrend (1hr chart), the HMA 8 shows you the pullbacks or retracements rather nicely.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
.EX4 is the compiled format .MQ4 is the source code

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Is this the same SDL previously posted here or did you make changes to it? You may want to state why your posting this. Traders may want heads up if any modifications were made.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I think he posted it for me because all I had was the EX4 file and not the metaquote language 4 file

Hey Guys, I have added a Psar alert to this program and it works nicely. It is not mine. I found it on another posting. Install both into your indicators folder. The alarm does go off too many times in case someone wants to fix this annoying feature Check it out

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Question, what are your time settings for each of the above charts?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I use 30 minutes.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I have a question for you, I tried the psar alerts, but cannot get the box to quit popping up, after an alert, can you? Will it stop, I must have tried 20 times closing the popup alert box, before removing it.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
the SRDCIII EA (already posted) gets pretty close to what we need. I've asked skyline if he can add a slope filter but he's pretty busy at the moment.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I opened the Slope Direction Line file and found a line which reads "extern int price=0; // PRICE_CLOSE". I'm not sure but I believe this could cause the indicator to repaint during a bar and if it does that would make back testing a little unreliable. Does anybody know how to change this code so it works on the Open price?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I too like the slope direction line on my chart but I have changed the setting to the following as I trade off the 30m chart and saw that some others were also using 30m chart for this system. These setting seem to work better for me. Period 30 Method 3 Price 0 Could someone please post the HMA indicator mentioned earlier. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Could someone please post the HMA indicator mentioned earlier. Thank you in advance.[/quote] Not real sure but believe HMA is same indicator. When I put it on chart it draws right on top of Slope indicator.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I posted a note stating that it would be annoying. It is not mine and I don't know how to cease it. Reference to time settings question, you replied back with your time frame on your charts. I was referring to the time settings on your individual pairs... are you using 6-9 box settings on all currency pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Thanks for the heads up my friend. This will be nice to check it out when he can do it. Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I guess I answered my own question. After surfing the web, and forum, I found that I need to check the allow dll imports box, in order to cancel the alert after the first time. I will try this Monday, seems to work now.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I set my charts up with the same settings that WHTenn used in post #661 but for some reason when I compare my chart with the one from post #669 the SAR dots on my chart are on a much higher plane and they reverse one bar earlier than his. You can see the difference if you compare my chart to post #669 and I wonder how many other people may have this same problem. I am worried that if I pay to get an EA written it may work for some people but not for others. I believe we are both using FXDD and would like to know if other people have the same problem or if maybe I need to make some adjustment that would put me in sync.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
On my chart, I use 30 minute, IBFX, but if I put it to 1 hr, it reverses at same spot 8:00 gmt, as yours. On his chart it is hard to tell where the sar dot is for the 7:00 hour, but it doesn't matter that much anyway, I don't think, because your other indicators are not agreeing, anyway. I use the lsma indicator, and my did agree, and change to red at the 07:00 gmt hour though.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
I do not use either of those indicators, only Slope Direction Line at present. My concern is that if these two indicator do not agree on my charts then how do I know that any will and therefor not cause my test results to vary greatly with other peoples.

I threw up my charts and then installed my Parabolic sar from both my indicator and custom indicator file folders and they matched exactly. Do this, go to MT4 help then click on about and verify that you have Version 4.00, build 2.11 dated 15 Oct 2007. Another trader noticed a similar problem about a year ago on this forum. I cannot recall what their findings were. It was a logical reason though.

Check out these two indicators that I am testing with this system. 1) Stoch Histogarm 2) StepMaStoch v1.1 I am attaching both to this post. Attach and play with them.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Looked back over my test results to compare Stoch indicator to Slope indicator. On some occasions the Stoch filtered some bad trades but also entered a few bad trades that Slope would have filtered out. Below is an example of one trade Stoch would have picked up that Slope missed. It is hard to tell for sure which one is best because of the indicator ability to repaint while a bar is being formed. I think I still like Slope better because of its ability to use Open price instead of Close and therefore eliminate repainting.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Just finished back test ON EUR/JPY using Stoch indicator and it does show better results than the slope indicator. Over a two month period the gain was about 100 pips if you only made one trade a day. There were days when it could have generated more than one successful trade in the same direction but I have only been counting one unless there was a reversal to the other side of box. My think was that one trade per day would keep you from getting stopped out more than once if the market was whipsawing.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
What I would like to get my hands on is an alarm that would go off when a breakout of the box occurs. I need to find someone that will do this.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
I was playing around over the weekend trying to figure out how to make one, and possible add indicator also for confirmation, but I am not a good programmer.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
That makes two of us my friend.... your not alone! Did you try the two indicators I just added?

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi Eagle I'm a french trader and I'd like to tell again about the timing of your system. With the setting 6:00-9:00, the third hourly candle begins at 9:00 and closes at 10:00 (end of the orange box). So, we are waiting for 10:00 (London time) to begin to trade. Is it right ? So, it's impossible to begin to trade at 9:00 ? What do you think about ? Regards French people love Materazzi http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Upper Pic... The first candle, (circled in yellow) that breaks outside of the red box is the one you start monitoring. When it breaks the white box, (red arrow) you take the trade. This is the actual trade for GBP/USD occuring at time of posting... moving nicely and agrees with my indicators. This is the hourly chart. Middle Pic... Just an expanded pic of last candle on same chart. Bottom Pic... Eur/Jpy going on at time of posting.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
ya, I like the stoch histogram better than the stepmastoch, but i still need to play more.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I thought you would

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Thanks WHTenn, I understood but the candle in the terminal line of orange box is the hourly candle 9:00-10:00 and the candle circled in yellow is the hourly candle 10:00-11:00. OK ? So, we must wait for the close of the candle 9:00-10:00 to begin the trade because the high and the low of the orange box are determined by that candle (and the two precedents). The beginning of the trade is at 10:00 (London time)! That's right ? If it's wrong, I must change my settings.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
The 10 candle is the one that is formed outside of the box. If this same candle breaks outside of the red box if your looking at the hourly chart. The box high and lows are determine by the 7-9 high and lows during that trading period. The 10 candle...as soon as it is formed (10:00:01), you watch this candle as if it was the start of the Grand Prix race. From that point you watch the direction and along with the other indicators, if it agrees with the indicators and it breaks the height of the box, you should take the trade going long and opposite direction for short. Continue watching the indicators associated with this movement. I trade large lots so I am only taking 25 pips which is very easy to obtain.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Thanks So, actually your settings are periodbegin = 6:00 and periodend = 9:00 ? OK ?

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Here you go, exact settings my friend. I got my pips with GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY. Waiting for my EUR/USD to come thru.

--- 帖子 #724 ---

So that 10 am bar would be the very start of London session, right?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Since the trading hours start after 2am, I have grown accustomed to staying up and trading.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Correct my friend

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Thank you. The reason I am asking is because of the controversy on "fake breakouts" during the 1st hour of the London session. I'll try to do a visual backtesting between 10 and 11 (one full hour after London opens). It would be interesting to see what this brings.I'll let you know when (and if) I get around to it.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
it was my question too the backtestings 6:00-9:00 and 5:00-8:00 are totally differents for EURUSD

--- 帖子 #730 ---
I am all ears... what are your thoughts on the backtesting? Do you like the 5-8 better on EUR/USD?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
no, the 6-9 is better i don't know why !

--- 帖子 #732 ---
If you put a few pips offset on box it filters out some of the false breakouts on some pairs. I,ve noticed EUR/USD several times just breading out 1 or 2 pips and then reversing.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
I trade large lots so I am only taking 25 pips which is very easy to obtain.[/quote] Do you use 25 pip target for all pairs? Do you use Stops and if so how big? Do you close trades good or bad at any certain time if target not reached?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
I would like to add an observation and share a technique I have been using with this method for some time. To avoid 'false breakouts' of the box, add a Stochastic Oscillator (5,3,3) to your chart (a standard MT4 indicator). As soon as the "Breakout Box" has completely formed, drop down to the 5 minute chart. Or you could just start at that time frame if you prefer. When price is about to break out of the box, consult the Sto Oscillator. DO NOT TRADE AGAINST this indicator on the 5 minute chart! Wait for the Sto to agree with the price breakout of the box. There will be times when a good trade is missed, but there will be more occasions when a bad trade is missed. The net result will improve your trading. I have attached two charts. The first shows waiting for maximum trade gain; the second shows avoiding a "false breakout". This helps me tremendously; I hope it helps others too!

--- 帖子 #735 ---
This was yesterday's trade!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
It's my understanding that this method is keyed to the opening of the London market. The "Breakout Box" closes when London opens at 8:00 GMT. However, a visual survey of EUR/USD would suggest that a large amount of price movement takes place in the one hour preceding the London open. I would attribute this to trading that takes place in Europe because those markets open one hour before London. Therefore, if the "Breakout Box" closed one hour earlier, it would be smaller, more compact and would appear to provide greater trading opportunities and hence larger gains, especially when filtered with the Sto Oscillator I referred to in the above two posts. Other currency pairs would probably be different. For example, I've observed that adjusting the "Breakout Box" to correspond with the Sydney and Tokyo opens works well with currency pairs closely correlated to those markets. Any thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
good idea so, you think to use settings 5:00-8:00 (EURUSD) with sto filter why not ? I'am trying

--- 帖子 #738 ---
What time do you have your box set for? Looks like it might be 1 hour different than most of us have been using.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
OK here we go, the great time discussion. I have the box set to close at 7:00 GMT. If you look at my posted 5 minute chart from yesterday, you can confirm that time........

--- 帖子 #740 ---
hmm...there is no time on your charts ...... http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #741 ---
The reason I asked about time was because the box high low prices change quite a bit when changing from 1 hr to 5 min. TF's and I had not seen your later posts with the explication as to how you used them.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
This alert is what I have been using to let me know when a breakout is occuring. (Helps with a little more sleep at 3:00am) I give credit to MAESTR2 from the FF thread of IMRAN SAIT Post #5499. There is a vidoe attached to this post that lets you know how this indicator works. There are also different sound files that you can load for different currency pairs. I just use the main sound file and it is annoying and keeps repeating itself until you move the lines thus you can't help but wake up and pay attention. (This is the first time I have sent and attachment with a post so let me know if I did it wrong.) Also if you have any questions after watching the video.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
If you isolate a three hour time period; ie. 5 AM to 8 AM GMT, the high and low prices for that period are fixed. It does not matter what time frame or chart you use to view that time period, the highs and lows will be the same. I suggested using the 5 minute chart because I have been using the Stochastic Oscillator as a filter for this strategy as explained in my previous posts.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
To view the video, open the indicator with MetaEditor. Two links are listed, both on youtube, showing how to use this custom indicator.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
We might be using different Breakout Indicators. Using Breakout-EAGLE_indicator (attached)when I set it for 5:00 to 8:00 on a 1hr TF it actually measures from 6:00 till 8:59. When I change to 5 min it mearures from 5:05 till 8:05. On the EURO yesterday the top price stayed the same but the bottom price changed from 1.4710 to 1.4701 when changed from 1 hr to 5 min. TF. Sounds like you might have a better indicator, if so please post it.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
You are correct when using the attached indicator on a 1 hour chart. I have used the same indicator on the 5 minute chart only, choosing to have the box close at 7 AM GMT (the opening time for European markets) because I also wanted to use the Sto Oscillator on that time frame for optimum entries. You might want to take a close look at the 5 minute chart history to see how this setup and method works.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
[quote=Abnormalone Do you use 25 pip target for all pairs? Do you use Stops and if so how big? Do you close trades good or bad at any certain time if target not reached?[/quote] Hey there... I use 25 pip targets for all pairs. I use 20 stops for usd pairs and 30 for jpy pairs. I stay with the trades until I do obtain my 25 pips. If they are bad, I jump out and reverse. Keeping in mind the daily average movement, I can get my pips.

Just found this great thread! Questions; 1.What pairs are most people trading with this method? 2. What timescales? 3. The dreaded time question - I am using StrategyBuilder and am in the UK. Strategybuilder works on GMT +2 and I am using the Breakout 6-9 indicator. This means that for GBP/USD the first bar on 15 min chart is 9:15. Is this correct? Really appreciate help form anyone out there on these - I dredged through the thread and got more confused than emlightened!

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Beachbum's great posting made me look at a different approach to my system. I also changed a few indicators and added a few thanks to the great additions by the traders on this thread. I am including my Template and indicators that I use. With the Breakout system, my times are set from 6-9 which does reflect the same time frame as BeachBoy's if charts were compared time wise. I am using the Chin Breakout Alert, xpMA, StochHistogram and Stocastics. This is the EUR/JPY 5 min chart.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Two more indicators and template on this post. This is the Eur/USD 5 Min chart

--- 帖子 #752 ---
This is the EUR/USD 5 min chart... nice move

--- 帖子 #753 ---
The 3 pairs I am trading are the EUR/JPY, GBP/USD and EUR/USD. Time frames I traded the above charts with are the 5M. Since your using a different system and a different broker, you need to find the time of the London open on your system. The first 5 minute bar on my chart is the opening of the London Session. You should look at my time frames on my chart and draw a line up and this should help you to determine the time frame. If you use the breakout indicator I posted, the time frames are 6-9. I hope that this helps. In my opinion, this thread rates 5 stars... everyone that agrees, vote on the upper frame of the top page.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Many thanks for your help. Noticed the posts by Spiritbreezer (p23 onwards). Have you looked at these? They started simple but rapidly got complex. Any thoughts? Looking at your approach it looks simple and works - what can I say!

Hi guys Try the following set 3:00-6:00 and backtest it It's great for EURUSD !

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Generally. wise words. Only everyone wanted to contribute with their one flavour. Nothing wrong with that this is what these froums are for. To get ideas. Also the basis of this system lies on one of the oldest trading concepts that works. It can make huge amounts of pips if applied wisely and if someone can fit it to its one personality. The ideas here are for to play around with and to fit to your personality.... Just my 2 cents. These kind of BO systems can be applied profitably.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
This is fantastic... can you test the EUR/JPY and GBP/USD? These are the pairs most watched with this system Thanks

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I use the Eagle'box and also differents indicators to filter the fake break out. My beginning chart is a 15 M and my parameters are a classical moving average (200 EMA), a classical parabolic SAR and a slope line for the trend. The indicators : MACD 12.26.9 and Sto 5.3.3 and a great thing: the Bands Squeeze based from the Bollinger Bands. Entry Rules: Buy if up break out and slope line green. MACD + is better but not necessary. I look also for the resistant or support lines. If a resistant line is too much near, I don't trade. I take only 15 pips (Eagle method) Sell if down break out and slope line red. MACD - is better but not necessary. If a support line is too much near, I don't trade. I take only 15 pips (Eagle method) I look also at Band Squeeze: if there are yellow bars and red line above, there is a a movement in preparation (generally important). When the red line cut the yellow bars,I check the others indicators to know the movement ( up or down ) and I take a position. Pivot lines, resistant lines and support lines are also importants. I check also the possible divergence ( only MACD ): it's always a very good indication. So, there are many elements for the decision. The main problem of this system is the hours settings beginperiod-endperiod. So, I advise you to backtest differents hours settings for your preferred pairs. Normally, good settings give a ratio W/L &gt; 7 . The following chart is interesting: 1/Eagle system: 21 pips possible (only 13 for me) - caution because the resistant line is near. 2/We see on Band Squeeze the red line cut yellow bars: at this time, it's difficult to determine the movement ---&gt; waiting.. Then MACD decline to 0 and red bars appear on Band Squeeze: it's possible to short at the down break out (red slope line) or MACD = 0 :70 pips possible with down trend (only 58 for me). 3/There is a nice bullish divergence on MACD: 35 pips possible following up trend ( no on the chart but it's true http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif )( only 28 for me because TP fixed during the night) Good trades, I think, but it's not always like that ! This is a synthesis of differents trading methods. Best regards.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I would view this Sto signal as "OK", but certainly not as good as when the values are at extreme levels, bouncing from those levels and turning in the opposite direction. My expectations for a trade from this signal would be lower than if I was trading from an extreme level. Buying from extreme 'oversold' and selling from extreme 'overbought' levels usually is best. The net result is fewer trades, but better pip gain. For this reason I look at all pairs that have a Euro currency in them (EUR, GBP, CHF) and choose the trade with the best setup using this method. Fewer trades, better quality trades, fewer losses, less drawdown and solid gains. I don't like 'overtrading'.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Thanks WHT. Please let me know when you have them. Question???? I have Telsa Alert Indicator installed. It works great. Draw a line... attach "Alert_0" to it and when it triggers, it sends an email and makes a sound. Then the alert_0 is removed from the line. In the Breakout Indicator Hapalkos added this capability. I turned it on last night and when the Box finished forming at 02:00 it put the Alert Lines on as it was suppose to. When the alert was triggered, instead of alerting and turning it off, it started looping with the sound. I had to turn the function off on the indicator to get it to stop... or ... delete the line. Anyone have a fix or thoughts on this issue? I guess I can continue to draw the lines manually, but if I could get this to trigger ONCE and EMAIL once, I could some more sleep. Thanks... Mike G

Seeing Madscalp's BB Squeeze made me think of another BB Squeeze that I looked at to use on another system, don't know why I stopped using it, but it looks good with this system. Looks like both BB Squeeze's could help to prevent false breakouts, thought I would attach the other one here and a picture of my EurUsd chart today. Let anyone who wants to play with this one also. Todays Chart - Using the BB Squeeze, the first three lines would indicate a false breakout, ( Could have picked up your 10 pips on #3 if that is all you are going for with this system ) however the fourth line the BB Squeeze says "Go For It" and proved to be quite profitable. I have looked back on using this on my charts for the last several days and it looks really nice.

Thanks eagle for your great system. It's very simple and profitable I takes me one day to read the whole thread I want to ask about the original system, 1. London now is GMT+0 and My server time is GMT+2. So london open is 10:00 am on my server time (GMT+2) So i should set from 7:00 am till 10:00 in the indicator, right? 2. I found that we can have more than 1 breakout. For example, The price breakout high 4 times. So I have to make 4 open position? or just the 1st one? Could u help? Thanks in advande

I saw a post earlier that you were a participant in and it was discussing trading out of your qualified money (ie. 401K and IRA.) Sorry to post the answer here on this forum but FF would not allow me to respond on that THREAD. You can set up your individual 401k to trade 4x as long as your broker allows it and you have a trustee holding the money that deals with your 401K broker. I looked into this last year through Millinieam and FXDD but was not happy with the answer to my questions from either groups "tax experts" so I did not move my indivual 401K over to them. However, I do know based on talking with my CPA last year this can be done. He told me your Broker has to accept the Trustee and Fee's. I only found one at that time that would do so, but doesn't mean there are not others. Apparently not prevented by the IRS, I mean they let you invest your qualified $ in Real Estate, so why no FX. In other words, ASK YOUR BROKER.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I don't think I've posted in this thread before, but follow it with interest, as a simple break-out plan has been part of my {and probably many others'} arsenal for some time. I also have to agree with BeachBum. Turtle just reminded me I've been trading the 1st hour {power-hour?} before session opens succesfully for quite some time. {Exception Asia, i usual position for a break of the first 4 hours} Eagles "box" just made it easier than drawing the horizontal lines myself! : Thanks dude!! So if I can add any value, if just for your research sake. Check this. 4H-breakout Asia Box: 00:00 - 04:00 GMT 1H-breakout Europe Box: 07:00 - 08:00 GMT 1H-breakout US Box: 12:00 - 13:00 GMT BTW, to the cody coders. Is there anyway of getting more than one box per TF onto the chart? I can only drop one on at a time, and don't really to MQL :. If not, no sweat, I do them manually. The reason I ask, is that often, a break of the open of europe for example, gets pushed back into within that range and can mill around there for hours. Then break again on US open, and find a range that is sometimes again, within the range set by the first hour. "The box" provides a very good "range guage" as well on those days. Check it. Hope that made sense.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
fsiltd, hi there, yep, I had the same problem trying to get more than one box on the chart. My way around this was to have two templates with the same chart set up but with different box time settings. Assuming you are using Metatrader. Template 1 for the European open, Template 2 for the US open. HTH Dave

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Yep, do that also sometimes, if I'm focusing in on 1 pair. Else as said. I'll leave the europe-open box on screen, and manual the rest. I only use MT for analysis sometimes. I don't actually trade the platform. Either way. If you're a short-term trader/long-term speculator as I am. The theory is sound. My acc balance is all the proof I need. PS. Sorry eagle, I'm not trying to "change" anything with this method/style/technique/stratagy/call it what you will. Just observations.

I have just finished talking on the phone with my friend Lisa to compare notes. We noticed that the Chin Breakout Alerts actually go off at times other than breakout times. This indicator alert is not working well with this system. We removed the indicator from our charts. Does anyone know of a reliable alert that can be attached to the break out box that will give an audible and possibly email/phone alert when the box is broken? Also, we are mainly discussing London times to trade this system. Does anyone have any settings for the USD market? And if so, what pairs can work with the USD Market?

These probably urk me the most! I don't know why people new to this "arena" insist on not really wanting to learn anything. I've mentioned before, I only recently started using this "break-out" box. Purely cause I'm gettin lazy! But it doesn't mean I didn't take the time to learn and implement a break-out plan/stratagy to begin with. If I can suggest anything of use at all to new traders reading this and other threads/forums. LEARN how the indicators, fibs, ganns, etc. actually work. Once you get the underlying concept of a thing, you can apply that knowledge regardless of pretty boxes, lines, xMA's. This thread is a perfect example. The plan is simple. The execution is simple. The concept is sound . Everything else that gets added to the mix, will NEVER change what it is/was to begin with. You don't even need the box to trade it. Get it. {Sorry, early morning, little sleep, quick vent :}

I noticed 1 trader has been trading 1 hour breakout box US session. Anybody else trading Eagle's box on US Session? Just wondered if so if it has been profitable?

Anyone looked at Murray Math as a means of screening out possible weak moves? Using WHTenn's basic template (in this thread recently) and adding MM to this on the 5 minute chart seems to improve things.

Can you get the indicator and I will be glad to add and test it my friend.

I added this Parabolic SAR Color-Alert to my chart. I found these here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=65055 thanks to MagnumFreak . This guy is amazing! A real asset to this forum. I easily picked up my 25 pips on each of my three currency pairs early this morning. Attached are the Parabolic SAR Color-Alert indicators and my trades and most recent template that you see in the pics.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
This is the one I use - there are countless versions and opinions (just like the Eagle times!) but the all give the same levels. I just use this one "neat" - no changes to setup. It recalculates around 12:00 (not the time discussion again!) so have a look.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Added and testing now my friend...Thanks a bunch I am also testing one from my friend cheelu too!

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Hi WHTeen, Thanks for indicator and template. Btw do you enter on the first bar breakout the box (which is still moving) or you enter the trade in 2nd bar ? Or just use buy stop or sell stop outside the box ? Thanks, MS

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Very first bar as soon as it moves beyond 1-2 pips outside the box. Good Luck

I have a general observation, and was wondering if anybody else noticed this. I had my breakout setting period end at 6:00 gmt, and at 6:10 gmt monday, I was waiting for the breakout to the upside of my gbp box after 6:00, and it wouldn't, box just kept enlarging. I was under the impression that the box stopped drawing at the period end time, but it ends at the end of the candle of the time specified, 30 minutes, on my chart, to the best I can figure. I moved my period end to 5:30, and it completed the box, showing me what I had missed. I hadn't noticed it until then because normally there is not much movement during this time, but Monday there was.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
If you are using one of the Custom Indicators from this thread, you should be aware that the Period End Time refers to the candle corresponding to that time. In the example you give, the last candle in the box will be the one that opens at 6:00 GMT. If looking at the 1 hour chart, the box closes at 7:00 GMT. If looking at the 5 minute chart, the box closes at 6:05 GMT.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
that is what I noticed exactly.

--- 帖子 #835 ---

Wow, your bright and cheerful here. Instead of saying that the "forex is stealin joy out of people", why not say this instead, the forex does not agree with you. You should not assume incorrectly. You want the instructions, etc... GO TO POST#1 and READ FROM THERE... as everyone else has done here.

Hey WHT, this is supposed to be my job here at FF! ..................................................

--- 帖子 #842 ---
this thread has been pretty quite lately---where is eagle at, on vacation again? is the reason this thread is a bit quite is due to the head fakes out there--there has been more recently on some of the pairs. Or is everyone just so busy making money off this system they are to tired to post results?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
OOPS, my error my friend. I wish you a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Thanks WHTenn for posting----for the EJ trade looked a bit tricky due to the first break it made up at 9gmt then going back down to the channel's lows then back up again thru the high of the channel at 12gmt --- did u get in on a buy then or a sell later on in that pair? on the GU pair were u able to avoid the head fake up also? i am guessing so--it tried a run up for 5 hrs after the channel formed. WHTenn do u tend to trade in the direction of the day chart and only enter trades on the 60min or 15min or what every time frame u use in the direction of the day chart? or do u counter trend trade if it is there.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Time based BOs can be very profitable when they are first discovered - (big Ben etc)..but they are generally a temporary phenonomon, and in the old phrase.. they work till they dont... Full marks to Eagle for this break..and thank you for sharing it..... I´ve made pips from it and Im sure others have too... I, along with many others, have tried to eye-ball charts to try to identify new patterns.. with great success at times, I must say. I´ve used both statictical programs and more recently EAs to scan data series to verify or disprove my and others different hypotheses. In the last fortnight on another FF thread a talented and generous member called saaedb produced an EA for a similar type system (to Eagles) published by Nicotina that is one such useful tool in establishing the history and patterns of such timeBO opportunities. Heres the link in case you havent covered it : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...aaedb&amp;page=111 the EA is called NicoaTinaBreakOut_V2.ex4 With respect to the author I have reservations about the accuracy of the current version of the code.. and more reservations because he has not released the code .. only an exe. Sorry, but I think its silly really because its good but hardly rocket science.. You must remember the big boys are using supercomputers to analyse the data for such opportunities..and even if they´re all not Im sure they check in with FF threads regularly, to see if they´ve missed something..LoL!

--- 帖子 #846 ---
last night I tried the EA you mentioned and I don't believe it works on the same principle that we have been discussing. It tried to open a buy when the price was below the box. Do you think that maybe the reason these EA quit working is because to many people start using them and maybe create to many orders all coming in at the same time? There are a lot of people following FF. Big people could see volume increases and start entering their own orders which would cause a counter reaction of some type.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I've modified the original indicator to include an email alert/ popup / play sound, whenever a breakout happens on either side of the box. This new indicator will also look in to the current trend indicated by the Slope Direction Line indicator that was discussed in the forum while ago. The new inputs to the indicator in addition to the existing ones extern int SlopeChartTimeFrame = 60; extern int SlopePeriod_Input1 = 30; extern int Slopemethod_Input2=3; extern int SlopePrice_Input3=0; extern int pipsbuffer=5; extern string sound_wav="alert2.wav"; SlopeChartTimeFrame is the timeframe on which you want to monitor the Slope Direction Line indicator . SlopePeriod_Input1 and SlopePeriod_Input2 and SlopePeriod_Input3 are inputs to the slope direction indicator. pipsbuffer is the number of pips the current price should have crossed from the high/low of the box , to be recognized as a breakout. sound_wav is the name of the sound wav file that u want tobe played when a breakout happens. This file should be there under experts/sounds directory. Any questions let me know . Hopefully it would be useful

--- 帖子 #848 ---
This is how I like to use the Eagle break-out method; I'll explain it later.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Here's the template; use it on Alpari UK (GMT +1)

--- 帖子 #850 ---
After examining the posted template, you know I have two MA's to show the current trend on the 1 hour chart. The purpose of the Red line/fast MA is to show where the average price is moving NOW! This will prevent being fooled most of the time by price spikes that leave the box and then fail to continue in that same direction. We want the Red line to penetrate the outside of the box; the sharper the angle and the wider the separation from the Blue line/slower MA, the better. But........pay attention to the Pivot, Support and Resistance levels as the price moves towards and away from these. Often times these are like magnets for the price. Once the red line has exited the box and we have examined the important price levels, it's time to trade. You can wait for the 1 hour candle to close, or drop to a lower time frame (15 or 5 minute chart) and plan your entry there. The key indicator is the Red line exiting the box. I'll post two charts to show what I mean about price spikes and avoiding fake signals: The first price spike marked by the "Hot Pink" vertical line broke below the box, but the Red MA line did not; it bounced off the bottom of the box. No Trade! Three hours later the Red line exited the top of the box along with the price; time to trade! The second example shows a price spike 'up' while at the same time the Red line was descending; don't buy, sell! Backtest this method for each pair you wish to trade to confirm it's effectiveness! If anyone has a question that can't be answered by thoroughly examining my template and the posted charts, I'll be happy to respond.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
where is the latest eagle box indicator

--- 帖子 #852 ---
BeachBum. In your first example: " The first price spike marked by the "Hot Pink" vertical line broke below the box, but the Red MA line did not ".... Are you sure the red MA did not break below the box in the same time the price did break it? You show an example where the price changed its way back upwards but in the real time, before it bounced back into the box, wasn't the red MA out of the box too? and 1 more question: your MA's are weighted and periods are 1 and 5?

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Good question smilee........ I can't answer positively for this example on the 1 hour chart because I don't watch that closely. I look at the 1 hour chart at about the half-hour mark to get a 'heads-up'. If the Red line has moved significantly outside the box, I'll consider a trade; but my preference is to wait for the 1 hour candle/bar to close with the Red line outside the box. There will be occasions when a reversal occurs, usually triggered by a news item or one of the important P/S/R levels. Otherwise, this is a powerful tool for me when trading a B/O. The 1 MA is Median price, no shift. The 5 MA is Open with a +1 shift. Both are linear weighted.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
I hope everyone got a piece of this pie this AM:

Here's a good question I received by PM: "Great work you did for improving eagle break out strategy. I saw your template and i have read ur strategy explained text. I have a question here. do you use the same template in trading gbpusd and gbpjpy" I use this template to plan for potential trades on ALL pairs that include one European currency (EUR, GBP, CHF).......15 pairs on Alpari UK. Also, I use this template for Asian currency based pairs by adjusting the hours for the box to 0:00 to 2:00 on the Alpari UK platform.........16 pairs. I don't use it for the NY market. HTH!

Beachbum, This 1 hr BO box is great, helped me pick up alot of pips this morning, with no false BO's. My Question- when my alert went off on the 1hr chart with the linear weighted average ma only, I dropped down to my 5min chart which I trade off, and price was still quite a bit away on the 5m chart of breaking out. Trading the ASIAN markets, the BO boxes were different sizes, and yes I took into account the box ending at the hour (2:00GMT) and (2:05 GMT on 5min) this made no difference. After I added candles to my 1 hr chart, the boxes were the same size at the London opening . Did you intend for the boxes to be different sizes (1hr vs 5min) which appears to occur when the MA lines are the only lines on the 1 hr chart, or did I do somehthing wrong? Thank You for your time.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Kudos Eagle for this innovation. you really did a good job. your breakout was tested and the result not bad. but one observation is that it only work when the trend is flat.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Thanks for your swift response to my question. I kinda love your tweaking as they mitigate false break-out. bravo! I have more questions here: 1. What are your settings for the eur pairs? 2. How do you narrow trading down to 5mins using this method. I will suggest that you do a comprehensive explanation of your 'Modified version' in PDF file(if time permits u) stating the settings and how u trade this more reliable tweaked system for more pips Thanks

--- 帖子 #860 ---
pipstalker, I wait for the box to be completed on the 1 hour chart; then place a vertical line on the top and bottom of the 1 hour box. Now when you drop down to a lower time frame, you will see the break out prices from the 1 hour chart. Plan your trade from this lower time frame if that is your preference. This process should prevent you from being confused by the different sized B/O box on time frames other than the 1 hour chart. Remember: we are interested in the B/O box from the 1 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Naijafx....................you're pushing it! I have already answered question 1 in post #855. If you want to enter from the 5 minute chart, use the suggestion in the previous post and follow the breakout of the Red line as the signal for a potential trade. If I spend the time to write a detailed pdf for this method, it will be for sale, perhaps on e-bay...................

It seems that WHTenn has been banned for infractions (temporarily I hope); some of his posts got a little unsavory on other threads. So I will respond for him in a style that should make him proud if he is viewing this: Naijafx................do you even bother to read previous posts? Or do you prefer to just jump in and ask questions without doing any research? You have PM'd me and asked questions that were already answered in this thread; now you post a question about the two MA's I introduced and explained just a few pages back. Here's my suggestion: before you ask any more questions, try to find the answers yourself; preferably by reading the thread that interests you. If, and only if, you cannot find the answer, post the question. I will be glad to help out when the answer is not readily available; sometimes staring you right in the face. If this arrangement is not agreeable to you, then as you suggested in one of your PMs to me; you can pay me to do your research for you, write an explanatory PDF file for you or even trade your money (if you have any) in a managed account. I am guessing that one of these alternatives would be to your liking. (PayPal account info available upon request!)

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Well, thanks for all u said about me, doesn't bother me coz am learning seriously here, I saw some similarity between ur modified system and george's. I believe that integrating them to make something tradable for me with confidence would be a nice one. Anyway, I don't feel bad in anyway, but kinda learning and reading all I could to become successful like you. Meanwhile, I used ur method to get some 50pips on thursday but i think 25pips is easier and safer for newbie like me. Thanks for all you've written about me, they are impetus, to fire me to the frontline. Once again, am very grateful for your swift response to my mails and please expect more. God Bless you

Hi Ive read this from start to finish in one day- fantastic thread! Ive traded the Asian High/Lows since September with a very modest profit each month on a 15-15 ratio but with a longer timeframe for the breakout box. This year it has been patchy with a number of false breakouts Whilst I have been convinced that a breakout based on the London opening not only suits my style of trading but has proved successful for a number of months I have struggled with developing the idea any further and felt that it could be much improved- the question was how? What you have achieved here is fantastic- by collectively sharing ideas you have taken an original sound trading system and put forward over the currency of the thread lots of different combinations that work together-many of which I hadnt even heard of! Thanks again to all of you Happy Trading Mark (UK)

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Well I hope this thread hasn't died. There's some great work on here....eagle, George, beachbum, etc.... it's a great thread and a great method. I haven't posted on here but this is one of the methods I use to glean a few pips from the start (for me) of the trading day. Very reliable although I have a slightly different set-up which suits me. It's my view that 10 pips a day can give you a very good living at this game, all else considered. (Not forgetting other pairs). I struggled for a long time in forex and this method helped me turn the corner. Shame to watch it fade away. Dave

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Hello Acko...... I think it's been quiet here because WHTenn 'went away' for a while and the rest of us are just quietly using this method to regularly bank pips. Would you mind sharing with us your "slightly different set-up"? All suggestions are appreciated..........

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Sure, no probs. Well, I like things very simple. I like to do the 15min. Just the BOut box set at 05:00 to 06:45. Box end at 10:00. Go for 10+spread only and no BOut trade after 10:00. Jump to my other methods then. This lets me get at the 7am candle should it start to rocket. All times GMT. I have the 50emas, close, high, and low: visual only. And Macd std settings. As we're only going for quick tens, I like to see the fast macd on the correct side of the slow for confirmation. I look at 6 pairs so you might think this could be 60 pips. Alas, no. I can only manage 3 comfortably if things go tits up, which they can as you know. I set buy/sell stops 2 pips beyond the box prior to 7am. A simple method, but reliable. About 65% hit rate, which could be improved upon I'm sure. What's your hit rate BB? Dave

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hello Dave.... My "hit rate" is close to 50% because I trade this method with very tight stops; and I have many B/E trades because I quickly move my stop to B/E. My thinking is that I want the price to move strongly in 'my direction' when it leaves the B/O box. If it stalls, I want out with a small loss or a B/E trade. Many times the price will move strongly AND quickly in my favor; those are the trades I want to stay in for as long as possible. I will do this by watching the 15 min chart and moving my S/L along until the price stalls or I get stopped out. The winners are usually large and the losers small; so the 50% win rate works well for my style of trading (and the B/Es are just the cost of doing business). HTH.........happy trading!

--- 帖子 #885 ---

i have some remarks about eagle breakout. And i think that one can be rich with that method by reducing losses. so how to reduce losses? and how to maximize profit! - if the height of the band is less than 90 you can go for tp=100 and sl=100 - if it's more than 90 you can go for 50pips or you can chose to do not place any buy/sell stop order. as for me i chose to stay aside. when the height is less than 70pips i double the lot and i go for 100pips. lest follow these pictures: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

tresorfx..........you might want to consider using ATR on a Daily chart as a starting point for your research. The current ATR (20) for GBP/JPY is 250. If you use 90 pips as a benchmark for the size of your breakout box on that pair, that amount is approximately 40% of the ATR (which incidentally equals the ATR on a four hour chart). A similar .4 x ATR (20) on other pairs (or ATR on the 4 hour chart) would probably be useful for initially deciding the size of your B/O box. I have been doing something similar to this when using this strategy because I am of the opinion that a smaller B/O box lends greater weight to a successful B/O trade. HTH!

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Tresor, what hours are you using for the indicator (5-8 GMT)?

Hi, your set up looks interesting, can email to me as well? at sleewc@gmail.com . thanks.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
to be sincere i dont know how to use ATR this indicator.... i dont know how it works? could you send me something about that indicator? As for the height of the box, i dont choose 90pips only by the histirical data, i practiced it and since, i didnot make any losses trade. certainly,i'm sure ATR will be be some thing very interresting. so i expect you for that good trade to all.

I must want to say one of the best system on forex factory. Unfortunately no so much discussion about this system is on going. i have consistent profit with this system. i do not feel need for any thing else. What i need just keep researching different methods to improve this system. Well it never let me down anyway. its very easy to follow. there are so many systems and very experience traders in this forum. I personally always got confused which one to follow which one to experiment. At last i decided three best systems for my self and this is one of them. Bullet point trade when market volatile. and almost every system work. Great place forex factory. Great people at forex factory. i will say Eagle is one of them. regards

Average True Range Average True Range Technical Indicator (ATR) is an indicator that shows volatility of the market. It was introduced by Welles Wilder in his book "New concepts in technical trading systems". This indicator has been used as a component of numerous other indicators and trading systems ever since. Average True Range can often reach a high value at the bottom of the market after a sheer fall in prices occasioned by panic selling. Low values of the indicator are typical for the periods of sideways movement of long duration which happen at the top of the market and during consolidation. Average True Range can be interpreted according to the same principles as other volatility indicators. The principle of forecasting based on this indicator can be worded the following way: the higher the value of the indicator, the higher the probability of a trend change; the lower the indicator’s value, the weaker the trend’s movement is. Calculation True Range is the greatest of the following three values: difference between the current maximum and minimum (high and low); difference between the previous closing price and the current maximum; difference between the previous closing price and the current minimum. The indicator of Average True Range is a moving average of values of the true range.

PIPer, did you have a chance to do further analysis on the style of entry, TP and SL. The backtest result posted on #543 was very informative. A simple Excel Program can be developed to calculate the box size, ATR and the possible PIPs to make [based on size of the box (as per tresorfx)]. I have noticed that if we add a 13 EMA on the chart. It can provide a good place to put initial SL. I feel if the box size is already 50%-60% of ATR, it is risky to enter trades. Any suggestion on such situations, where one should not trade at all, say before major news or conflicting 4H/Day/weekly signals, quite period etc. Specially for those who are on the Pacific Coast, it is not possible to monitor beyond London open. Thanks

Hi Tresor, REally interesting with your research. But.. until now I don;t know how to use the indicator. and also don;t know which indicator that you are using. Please do advise me for the detail.. can you? Really appreciate adn thank you Be4. REgards.

hi eagle i am using using your system and its perfect. Its excellent and i am always in profit. Great thanks to you and looking forward your new system. regards

Thanks brother. Be working for all of us ...

Hey Eagle, Where have you found is the best spot to place your stop loss? I've been using this type of trading for over a year, and I can never figure out a good stop. It's the middle of the night for me, so I usually place the trade, then wake up every hour on the hour until I've taken profit, or I decide to manually close. I'd love to make it a set and forget strategy, but I want to give myself enough room to let the trade breathe. Thanks. Bob

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Thanks Eagle... That's Italian, I'm assuming?

can anyone translate that...lol

Hi, there there must be a good reason this thread is still alive, given that some nice man developed the EA according to this strategy, and according to the strategy test, it seems this EA doesn't show good potential, and doing forward testing, the result is negative. no idea how to bridge the two scenario, anyone could please explain? thank you

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Do you know any thread with back/forward testing with positive results???

--- 帖子 #920 ---
I have dozens of eas with positive back testing result, but, surely after the optimization; occassionaly, there could be a couple of EA still keep positive in a forward testing, but, definitely hardly on a second forward

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I agree. Discretionary and optimization are my first enemies.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
what do you rely on to trade then?

--- 帖子 #923 ---
1. Find High and Low at Italian Time(GMT+1) From 5 am to 9am 2. Add your spread on High, subract to Low 3. Insert orders (i assume just after 9am) 4.(6.)Set Take profit to 50 pips, Stop loss to 60 pips from entry 5. Close the opposite position whenever 1 got filled 6.(4.) If Take profit Stop loss wasnt hit till 23 pm close the position. 7. Check support and resistance on the 4 hour timeperiod with De Mark indicator

HI MR eagle thank u for sharing this amazing strategy with us, that show how much u like to help others,and to MR cliffedwards :maybe igot some how hurry when isend my first message because (when i so the 62 pages,which are realy too big,and also because i was NEW to the forum , and because iwas wanting to see the latest strategy),but after isend that message on 31 may istarted reading "and when iwas reading i noticed that ishoudn't send that message before finishing reading of all pages" and now iam in page 52 . Thanks MR EAGLE and MR CLIFFEDWARDS for help and sharing this great strategy.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
The last two months i tried this strategy with a demo account... and i can say that it pass the exam to apply it on my live account... of course I realize that it is wise to put an SL according with the average volatily of the pair... It works better on EUR pairs...

--- 帖子 #932 ---
I have experimented with the original indicator... setting this at 3:00 to 7:00 London hour (i´m trading with Alpari UK), offset usually at 5, SL ATR*1 + Spread, TP ATR*2, SL moved at BE. I usually leave two pending orders before go to sleep... one BuyStop and another SellStop... not all the days... I realized looking at the charts that with this way this signal can win almost 40 to 50% if uses a SL of 1*ATR and 60 to 70% of the time and more if uses SL of 2*ATR ... I have´nt tried with another pairs... or another complements... Thanks Eagle

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Casi me olvido.... I tried with the american session (using better with 10:00 to 14:00 London hour) but the result are not as good as the european session...

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Zeropip how are you handling stops/limits with this strategy???

--- 帖子 #935 ---
same as European session... (SL = 1*ATR(20)+Spread; TP = 2*ATR(20)); but American session is erratic with the EUR pairs... USD pairs works better in this session.... I have tried TP = 1*ATR with more success with EURUSD...

--- 帖子 #936 ---
My wife uses an SL of the High - Low of the Indicator´s square and a TP of 161.8 Fib... with almost the same win probability... I will test this setting this week... only european session I will post the results ...

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Well... This is the first day... (live account) Yesterday I selected two pairs for trade... trading only 0.02 microlots per pair order for this forward testing, and these are the first results: Closed orders: EURUSD -50, -50 (both pending orders hit the SL.... it can happens from time to time)... EURCHF -35, Opened orders: EURCHF currently at -18... Balance account: -26.77 I will continue post the results daily...

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Zeropip Interesting approach with ATR*2. . I assume the ATR SL is NOT dynamic? but is set on the reading available at entry. I use same idea but less rigid.... just set SL based on a typical ATR for each pair...generally about 50 but on low ranging pairs like EURGBP 38-40, and on the volitiles GBPJPY / GBPCHF etc 65-75. Does anyone know of a trade management EA that offers dynamic SLs based on ATR? Be interesting to see if it made a difference.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Yes... The european session starts 2:00 am in my city... so it is very late to follow the SL and TP, so I must let it on FF (fire and forget)... An EA could make a difference... of course... but i think one must be careful to select the pair and not trade those with recent ranging history...

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Zeropip Have you considered periods of drawdowns with this sytem?? I like your ATR apporach by the way

--- 帖子 #941 ---
I have two little accounts to test the trading strategies live after demo. These account are opened on Alpari (UK)... and currently testing four systems... OzFx, Eagle BO, TSR Igor, and Fozzy... I prefer to use Jacko´s approach in my main account (fibo retracements mixed with a fundamental strategy)... Well yesterday was a bad day to start live testing this system Here are the results... (live account) 28-04-08 EURUSD: -50 (L), -50 (S) (SL was the range of the square... I sorry) EURCHF: -35 (L), -35 (S) Total pips = -170 29-04-08 (TP 2*ATR, SL 1*ATR) Closed orders: Opened orders: EURUSD: 50 (S) None EURCHF: 30 (S) EURJPY: 50 (S) EURCAD: 60 (S) Total pips = + 190 I have excluded EURAUD and EURNZD because these pairs have too many spikes... and high spread... better with larger timeframes...

--- 帖子 #942 ---
That´s why I´m testing live.... demo is not accurate with the drawdown results... If you wanna trade Money management is IMPORTANT...

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Hi ZeroPip, I think that your results could be better if yoy set TS (trailing stops) to your trades. Your targets are very chalenging, and if you reach them, you will have a lot of pips. but, in many cases, the pending order triggers, the graph start moving in your target direction, and turns around. Dont you deserve getting something from such a trade ? Using TS's may give give you some green pips that are better then the results you currently have. Another option can be changing you RR ration to 1:1, TP 1 ATR, SL 1 ATR. Just my 2 cents, BR Dani M

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Zeropips... Im sorry you had a bad experience with your trades today. Maybe if you have time you might look at a slightly different approach that Ive had some success with recently. Use the breakout-eagle_indicator-with_autospread indy but set to 04:00-08:00 GMT..(that would be 5-9 London summertime - 6-10 CET etc) Use an xPMA indy set at 10-5-0-0.8... 60m chart. version A - Trading only in the direction in which the xPMA enters the 4-8 box and cancelling orders at anytime during the day, if xPMA changes colour (red&gt;green or vica versa---yellow and yellow back to original colour is ok) place buy/sell orders with maybe 2/3 pips room. You can trade all majors and most crosses. Ive lookd at 20+ For TPs and SLs a sensible range/ATR approach is best. and use all usual TA, S&amp;R, Day, week and month H/Ls , Fibos etc for in Trade management Heres the score from today for the 20+ pairs I´ve been looking at... 11 signals..9 worth 50+ pips &amp; 3, more than 20 pips. Triggered signals.. Majors... EURUSD - 50+ USDJPY - 80+ AUDUSD - 60+ USDCHF - No Signal GBPUSD - No Signal NZDUSD - 30+ Crosses... EURAUD 100+ GBPCAD 50+ AUDJPY 100+ etc.. check em out your self.. Like most breakout approachs its not great when markets get in gittery tight ranges... before a major announcement or during consolidation days.. Try checking it back visually. in last three weeks, worst day - last Monday-- best previous Monday. Some days xPMA filter rules out some great moves. So I´m working on a "sub-rule" to allow bypass in certain conditions. Finally.. as I´m sure you know...indy "Signals" CAN differ depending on broker feed. I use an ODL demo. which is GMT based.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
I don't know if anyone still reading this thread can help, but is it possible to change the original indicator so that it displays the high and low above and below the box. It would just make everything a little easier and quicker. Much appreciated Max

If we carry out basket trading using eagles break-out system, the profit will be much. We can hav say a 14 Currency pairs and trade the breakout of 14 of them. One advantage of trading currency in a basket is that the profitable currency pairs will cover for the losing ones. We can set a collective stop loss and collective take profit level. When any of these is attained, we close the trade. Attached is a screen shot of a demo I experimented on this. I used EA for this.

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Timex hi.. Ive been developing a similar approach...I was interested that you use the SDL indicator. I use xPMA 10/5/0.8 trading only in direction of trend. Tested basket of 22 for 4 weeks.. with specific high probabiity pairs AUDUSD, Cable, EURJPY, EURAUD, GBPCAD, GBPJPY ,AUDCHF &amp; NZDCHF. SL 50/65 with 3 TPs using a trade management EA. Spacing set each day based on individual volitility trending/ranging/consolidating and recent ranges. I notice your screenshot shows 100 pip sl/tp what kind of results have you had with this or are there just virtual stops with real ones hidden? C

--- 帖子 #953 ---
I got an expert advisor from one of the forums that hav similar Breakout strategy. The setback is that d expert advisor doesn't take the existing trend into cognizance. After the end of 8, it places pending orders at both end of the box. Whichever is triggered first is taken and the other pending order is cancelled after some time. The EA has the basic principle as Eagle's on page 1 of this thread. It'll b better if some1 can produce an EA that takes Slope direction line into cognizance and will only enter trades in the direction of the slope. The EA shld also consider news events. If I had asked the EA 2 take 10 pip profit from the currency in d basket, I'm sure it will b a winner as some of d currency went 20 pips, some 30 pip before changing course. My settings yesterday was TP = 100 and SL = 100. I closed d trades when total profit was 220 pips. 2day, my settings are TP = 60, SL = 100. Not nice, though d EA has banked 290.86 pips and stop loss hit on eurjpy. The other trades are running at losses. Cliffward, I'm sure if an EA is well developed that has no SL or TP for each Cpair but a collective SL and TP, we hav something nice. I say collective SL and TP becasue some of the trades closed for 60 pips profit are still profitting. They could hedge d losing ones. Cliff, your thoughts

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Attached is a manual for d EA. Any1 good in programming can hav a feel of d program by looking at d manual. U would hav discovered that the EA programmer made his, use-only, so its difficult for me to make modification if I can.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Like the thinking.. There is an element of hedge but be careful of (1)different value pips /ie lot sizing...(2) check what the REAL hedge potential is.. say your short GBP and 5 GBP crosses.. cause the pound is gone weak overnight then it suddenly whips an hour after your trades are triggered...-news or some other event risk- a resistance reversal level..whatever...WooooH... if the other majors are quiet...suddenly you are in deep DoDa on six trades . .. You thought you were hedged but you were actually very exposed to GBP reversal.. Now Im NOT being negative.. just that we would need a balancing calculation to ensure we dont get too exposed to any specific major ... (does that make sense?) I'm working on another persoective... How to sort out the highest probability trades from the slope/xPMA filter on eagle. I've done visual back through April, and IDd 7 pairs that have proved most consistent for my version of system. I've also begun to do analysis each morning on relative strength majors.. Today for example the system showed CHF and yen bullish.. and GBP NZD &amp; AUD unanimously bearish. Majors and all crosses.. This suggested that relative strength winners , assuming trend continuation.. and trigger..would be Short AUDJPY AUDCHF NZDJPY NZDCHF GBPJPY &amp; GBPCHF. and USDCHF... This basket had over 600pips potential win today on just 7 trades!!!!!!!.. Of course if it had reversed....LoL

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hey Abnormalone, glad to see I'm not the only one that is not normal! I have created an EA too of sorts for this a while ago. I was messing around with different timeframes (i.e. two charts with different boxes for same currency) In the end I got tired of having to maintain 2 EA's, and so instead modified mine to pick up the times and prices from the breakout indicator. (I know you can declare the start / end times as external variables but each time the EA was recompiled it would default one set of charts and I'd have to change them all) To get the values, declare these variables: string monitorbox = ""; string tradingbox = ""; datetime MonitorBegin = 0; datetime MonitorEnd = 0; datetime TradingBegin = 0; datetime TradingEnd = 0; int boxcolour = 0; double boxhigh = 0.0; double boxlow = 0.0; ... and put this near the start of init(): monitorbox = StringConcatenate("BoxPeriod ", TimeToStr(TimeCurrent(), TIME_DATE)); tradingbox = StringConcatenate("BoxHL ", TimeToStr(TimeCurrent(), TIME_DATE)); if(ObjectFind(monitorbox)==-1 || ObjectFind(tradingbox)==-1) { Comment("No BreakOutBox Indicator, quiting..."); return(0); } boxcolour = ObjectGet(tradingbox, 6); // i used the colour as the magic no MonitorBegin = ObjectGet(monitorbox, 0); MonitorEnd = ObjectGet(monitorbox, 2); TradingBegin = MonitorEnd+60; // only start trading a minute after monitor end TradingEnd = ObjectGet(tradingbox, 2); boxhigh = ObjectGet(monitorbox, 1); boxlow = ObjectGet(monitorbox, 3); conditions for trading time: if(TimeCurrent()&gt;=TradingBegin &amp;&amp; TimeCurrent()&lt;=TradingEnd) conditions for long: Bid&gt;=boxhigh conditions for short Ask&lt;=boxlow The nice thing about this is that if you use the offset in the breakout indicator it also gets added here so the boxhigh and boxlow automatically moves out. hope that helps SF412

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Hi Jas, It doesnt matter where you live. Your broker's time is the only thing that matters. I see you are using Interbank FX. IBFX time is same as GMT. There are several differnt box times that people use. the most recent famous ones are 1) london break out 00:00 to 2:00 AM (CST) , which is 05:00 to 07:00 GMT 2) US breakout 06:00 to 08:00 (CST) , which is 11:00 to 13:00 GMT. http://www.forexmarkethours.com/ You might be interested in the following threads http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=106489 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=103682

Hi Eagle, Thanks for posting Are you trading a straight breakout and using the weekly to determine a longer term trend thereby serving as a filter? Kind regards Mark

--- 帖子 #984 ---
hi Eagle Why you have changed ur trading rules? I thought you had 1 hour TF why weekly now? Did you find trading 1h TF and scalping hard with your method? I'm currently using panca scalping on 4 h TF for 25pips and it's been rolling with the martingale system. I know martingale is very risky, I've been betting on sports last year and I lost all my deposits due to the martingale system but with this panca I'm generating good. Can you clarify why weekly TF?

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Thanks for the great system. My question though, how do we filter false break-out?. Are you using weekly chart to determine the overall sentiment of the market.?

any body still on this system? Why did the thread Die suddenly

Up to this point, ive learned that this system provides great results with EUR,GBP, and CHF pairs. I just have two general questions 1. How to determine a false breakout of the box 2. Where to take profits( 2 times the pip range of the box or...) I've tried some methods for the false breakouts but none seem to have worked too much. Anyone have any thoughts?

Hi Eagle!, I have been looking at charts for several days looking for a new trading method to compliment my existing ones. After a couple of hundred hours at my PC I thought I had discovered a fantastic new Breakout system. I was so excited! I continued my research and did all kinds of backtests and spreadsheets to back up my discovery - everything was looking incredibly good. Today I decided to go live with it and it worked like a charm. After that I though I need to build an indicator so I would not have to draw the lines manually on my charts and as I was searching - I found your EAGLE BREAKOUT INDICATOR ! It is EXACTLY the method I THOUGHT I Had Discovered, but you beat me to it. This is a super indicator and I have already included it on my charts an have had a great trading day. THANKS for all your work and for sharing this indicator. PS. As I was typing this, I just had another winner with EURJPY!

--- 帖子 #990 ---
BIG!!!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS !!!!!

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Hi Folks, I use a similar strategy on the GBP/JPY and post it on the GBP/JPY Indicator thread that seemed to have died. You all are welcome to join me there, but I do no calls, just observations. I trade live full lots, so I am committed and am profitable, but you must make your own trade and money management decisions. No whiners! I will endeavor to codify my trading rules for clarity. Bon Pippage!

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Yes.. PA has reverted to a temporary pattern which makes this strategy profitable in current market conditions on some pairs.... Thanks Eagle.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
I have been back-testing and trading this system live for some time now ..... and I am deeply grateful for the person who introduced it. This is a sound, solid system ..... however, I have taken the liberty to combine a couple of things with it which have been very very helpful in taking my trades. An Indicator called AK_Zig_Zag_Pointer. EMA144 EMA169 I believe these EMAs form a tunnel which is perhaps called Vegas Tunnel? or something like that. If a breakout is happening towards this Tunnel I get very cautious or dont take the trade at all. The safest trade is when trading price is 35 pips away(EUR/USD) which is considered a rebounding zone. If a breakout faces the ZigZag Pointer ..... it means the price is upfront with a vital support or resistance point. And with the keen scrutiny I have learned that this sytem works flawlessly if you turn your time frame to 5M ..... I mean add the indicators to 1H but then turn the chart into 5M for your entry. I am adding an image of a recent breakout and you will know how zig-zag pointer and Vegas?Tunnel let me get away with a few pips and I did not had to worry about my SL. Providing I can always settle down for fewer pips .. only if they are in profit. P.S. Sorry I forgot to mention my entry rules ... which are a little different ... I let one 5M candle completely open and close outside of the box shadow and take the trade on next bar open ... as of fixed SL .... that could give you grief ... always decide your SL according to the price movement in the market. Thanks and would love to hear how it sounds.

ive seen this one before... actually the original creator use simple moving averages, not exponential moving averages... its basically a very simple trading method... its the same as how you interpret price vs moving averages.. a close above is bullish, a close below is bearish... the creator chose long term moving averages because they move relatively slow vs say a 20sma of course if you play based on a moving average which is flat youll be right 50% of the time and when you are right and stick to that side itll of course be profitable

Absolutely not ..... I don't trade the tunnel or moving averages .... I just use them as a filter. I use them to know if the breakout I am getting will go up further ..... I use zig zag for the same purpose .... I trade eagle breakout system not these moving averages .... if I used them, I won't need breakout indicator and if I used them I would take trades even outside the box when price touched these EMAs.

Interesting approach..zotopec.. thanks for sharing.. Can you upload a copy of the indi? and tpl file you are using.. Also I notice you are using different TF and Breakout box settings..?

--- 帖子 #997 ---
I have attached the copy of indicator here ..... however, template is default. I have attached the indicators to my chart on 1H and then changed it to 5M TF, thats why you are seeing an out-stretched box .... the tunnel moving averages are, of course, Exponential and none other. If you are way too cautious in taking trades feel free to add a 400SMA ...... thats the red line in my screenshot and also consider it a filter. And believe me, this set-up could not let you take a trade someday .... but whenver it lets you, you will be happy. Pip Up! P.S. No system is flawless and no system is useless either. When market behavior changes, we gotta modify our system, shed some things and add some things .... and it still works.

Hi folks, to clear things up: i am a system tester (pro). I tested the eagle system Eur/usd, took me 5 hours: win: 10 Pips /sl:20 and 10Pips / sl: range of 6-9 GMT (this means the stop loss is set at the barrier of the other possible entry: example: long on 13500, short on 13450 -&gt; in on 13450 (-&gt;sl: 13500) cause we got in at 13450, so the other side is the stop loss. The results are normal/nothing special: 10 Pips / sl:20 = break even , the other system (10Pips / sl: range of 6-9 GMT) -720 Pips (!) .... The Problem of the system is, that you win often but if you loose you loose more than you made before: Example (10 Pips win/sl: range of 6-9 GMT): 10 10 10 10 -83 .... that's the Problem: overall you loose -43 Pips. The longst winning series was about 19 times in a row, so you made 190 Pips in a row, but overall you loose. if you set sl to 20 Pips in Range, it's break even(about :2000Pips / -2100 Pips) , tested back to 18/2/2008 .... The System does NOT work, at least for Eur/Usd from 6-9 GMT. I think if you tweak the system a bit you can get a CRV (Chance/Risk) of 1,5 to 1,8 MAY BE... nothing interesting for me, too bad, if some indicators change systems get back to break even or worse. Thanks for all forexmembers for their ideas, this was my contribute to the scene. But thanks for the idea !

Hi all, I have followed the early part of this thread and wanted to thank Eagle for posting it. Personally I am a big fan of simple strategies, and I also believe that human judgement and intuition will walk all over technical indicators anyday. To that effect I have been trading the GBPUSD and EURGBP only, and using a trailing stop of 10-20 pips. If that isn't hit I'll take over manually. I usually make around 2-3% of my total bank each day. So far I have not had a losing day, it's been about two weeks. The thing about these breaks is, they are often far more than 10 pips, so why not let them run? At least then when you find you're in a fakeout, you can take a 20 pip loss on the chin and still re-enter when it breaks the second time. Thanks again for such a simple, commonsense post. Cheers Dazman

I'd like to thank Eagle for coming up with a profitable strategy like this, i've paper tested this strategy for four months and average monthly pips is 1800 for both gbp/usd and gbp/jpy pairs with tp/sl of 80/40 and 100/60 respectively on different break-out times, i only look 2 hours back on my chart, i also use a moving average indicator to help prevent me from entering others on ranging market conditions, it greatly fishes out situations where both sell and buy orders would execute and both hit stop losses. With proper money management, patience &amp; dedication to ur style, one should be able to make 50% - 75% ROI after an average of every 20 trading days (a month of trading).

fxtrayda, How do you implement the use of an MA with this breakout system? Could you please elaborate on how you are trading? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I use 14SMA (levels 5 &amp; -5) for both pairs, i don't place orders if three or more candles prior to my trading time were touched by the sma or any of it's levels, however i still take trades if the range (Highest - Lowest) price of the last two candles is greater than or equals to 80 pips irrespective of the sma touching issue. i also do not place orders if the range is less then 40 pips. please demo trade this and get used to it b4 attempting on a real account, best of luck. i'm not good in programming but i believe it shouldn't be difficult to find someone to make an EA for this.

Hmm.. I think above all, this is just the same with using EA. the trigger will automatically callculated by the systems (EA)and what we do just use our gut to make the decision. Im the big fan of Jesse Livermore... he's the true chartist.. by 'Observing' the market Movement he can analysis the trend and the strenght. But again System is the heart and the mind of today's trader.. some still lose money -due to lack of dicipline and some make a heck of money - due to lazyness or neglected to their emotion (EA doesnt need u to be present when trading) I think traders today are losing a very important think intrading - their xperiences. Old scool took them years to master, but we just need few day to be the same level with them. Cheers

Hi just to check, is anyone still using this system? If there is, how's the system performing? Thanks, Andrew.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi Andrew, I just found it too. I am also looking at 'BOWALF' and 'Box Breakout - Set and Forget' Lots of the same idea. You might be interested.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
