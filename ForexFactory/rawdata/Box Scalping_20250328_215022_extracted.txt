Box Scalping Live Trading Box Scalping could be used at EURUSD M1/M5 and can be trade at all times when the spread is tight. Box Scalping has only 3 rules. (1) Enter after one "Fulfilled Box"* (2) Set a Stop Loss at the opposite End of the Box (See further: How to set a Trailing Stop in "Box Scalping", p.3, # 31 ). (3) Exit your Trade at the next Entry or several Pips later Further more, see "Trade Examples", "Fulfilled Box Location". I wish you a lot of pips.

Interesting strategy, Forexcube, thanks. I have problems with the "fulfilled" Part. I would draw much more boxes than you so I don't know when to draw. May be you can explain it ? Have a nice weekend ! Jack

By trading with a 10'000.-$ Account you could trade with (A) 1 x 0.1 Lot or (B) 3 x 0.1 Lots per Entry. or with a 1'000.-$ Account (A) 1 x 0.01 Lot / (B) 3 x 0.01 Lots. Option (B) I. Go out with the first 1 x 0.1 Lot Order at the next Box (+10 pips) (by a 10-Grid-Box-Scalping) / (+5 pips by a 5-GBS) II. Exit with the second 1 x 0.1 at the box after next (second box which follows) (+20 pips) (by a 10-Grid-Box-Scalping) / (+10 pips by a 5-GBS) III. Exit the third 0.1 lot order with the next opposed Entry Level .

Isnt this basically the same thing as 10 pip Renko? with the advantage of seeing the underlying PA? pretty cool tho!

Example 5-Grid-Box-Trading EURUSD, M1 This Example demonstrate a 5-Grid-Box-Trading (5 Pips Boxes) with the Focus of all Enter Shorts. When the first 5 pips has reached and the market price goes further down into the second Box (labelled with "10") you have to trail the Stop Loss from -5 Pips to 0 Pips (Zero). The Results per Trade could be seen in every column at the bottom of this figure ("SUM Per Trade" in Pips). May be you have to reduce the number by roughly 30% (Spread and Time Delay). See also # 24 , please.

FXcube, Looks very interesting ... How do you place the boxes ? In other words, do you have rules (other than visual) ? Thanks, FerruFx

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi FerruFX Sorry, it's exclusive visual. May be someone could code a script (perhaps based on the Grid Builder) or an EA and post it at this thread here. FXcube

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Fx Cube, Very interesting strategy, however there is always room for improvement. Especially to avoid whipsaws or forgetting the big picture. Maybe placing levels on your chart for significant S&amp;R levels to keep an eye on the big picture but the whipsaws would still pose a threat. What measures do you have in place to avoid whipsaws? Good system/idea, simpler=better

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Matt795 When volatility is increasing (Candles are getting longer) you don't have to react at every reverse (see bright green marked squares - "by increasing volatility" at # 11 ). Your arguments have to be incorporated. That's fine: S&amp;R levels. I focus the S&amp;R, the Murrey Math &amp; the Pivotals. Then again by scalping you earn 1-5 pips most of the time. I will point out one multipurpose Whipsaw-Strategy soon. FXcube

--- 帖子 #16 ---
In the post #11 picture, did you placed the boxes back on chart or in real time live ? If in real time, what is your "visual" decision to fix definitively a box and then wait for the break ?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Boxes were completed in the aftermath.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Script or EA? Maybe a script should be written... ...by the Market Entry [Option (B) 3 x 0.1 Lot / 3 x 0.01 Lot, see # 5 ] at + 5 Pips and +10 Pips Ranges (by the 5-Grid-Box-Scalping)* with an automatical Exit at +5 Pips (first 1 x 0.1 Lot), next +10 pips (second 0.1 Lot) and the third (last) one at the next opposite Entry Point with trailing the Stop Loss at the Zero Line when the Market Price is going further on in the second Box and a SL-Trail at the +10 Pip when the Market Price is running in the third Box. Then the optical problem should be solved (may be with the HH and HL Concept, et vice versa) as far as possible. *by the 10-Grid-Box-Scalping: Automatical Exit at +10 Pips (first 1 x 0.1 Lot), next +20 pips (second 0.1 Lot) and the third (last) one at the next opposite Entry Point or at +30 Pips, by trailing the Stop Loss in the light of the aforesaid.

Hi Forexcube, I downloaded and installed the Grid Builder, but all I have is some green lines, no boxes. Am I doing something wrong? Thank you, Darryl

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Darryl! All you've done correct. The Grid-Template isn't at my chart. I have put it on this threat and have given a link for all traders who like more lines then boxes,..., the only reason. Sorry for my misunderstanding comments! Best regards Fxcube I have make a comment in # 10 now afterwards.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
OK, how do I get the boxes on my chart like you have? Looks like a good method.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Download the template in # 21 and alter the size of the chart described in # 23 , please. But you don't need the template. It's all at "Properties" &gt; "Common" &gt; "Show Grid" when pushing the right Mouse Button directly on the Chart.

How to set a Trailing Stop in "Box Scalping " Trailing Stop A trailing stop is often utilized in connection with the stop loss. Indeed, it would be futile to attempt the trailing stop without first setting the stop loss. That is because the main purpose of the trailing stop is to move the stop loss incrementally in the direction of the profit target as the currency price moves way. Such has the effect of incrementally bagging profits while the position remains open. The original stop loss level cannot be reached by the price reversal without the trader's position having first been closed automatically at the new stop loss level made possible by the trailing stop. See further: Article Source: http://EzineArticles.com/635290 , (also # 32 ) De facto: If the Market Price is running up in Level 3 Box (L3) you can set a Trailing Stop (1. Trailing Stop) at the Bottom of L2 (border between L1 and L2: 1.4255). If the Market Price is raising in Level 4 Box (L4) a Trailing Stop (2. TS) could be place at the Bottom of L3 (L2/L3 barrier: 1.4260), ... and so on. So place the Trailing Stop at the Bottom of a Level Box below the actual Price Level Box every time. In "Box Scalping" you could mange it like the Example below.

Forex - Trading With The Stop Loss And Trailing Stop By Sandy Robinson, J.D. There are various risk management tools available to the trader in the foreign exchange (FOREX) market. Two of the most common ones are the stop loss and the trailing stop. What are they and what are they used for? Are they necessary for successful trading? This article will help you to understand these concepts and provide answers to these questions. Stop Loss The platforms provided by many online FOREX brokers contain built-in features such as the stop loss and the trailing stop to help manage certain risks inherent in trading. A stop loss is a feature which allows the trader to pre-determine the price level at which the position will be automatically closed should the market move unfavorably against the open position. The primary benefit of the stop loss is to put a cap on the amount of loss a trader is willing to suffer. A well-placed stop loss is an essential component of an effective trading strategy. There are, however, traders who trade without a stop loss or trade with the stop loss set improperly. Both of these approaches are courting disaster. Day traders will typically have a different approach to setting a stop loss than those who take long-term positions. Because they are more interested in making quick profits resulting from small market movements, the day traders will typically utilize a smaller stop loss. In contrast, the wider stop is favored by long-term traders who are less concerned with the smaller moves of currency prices, including the temporary reversals present in the trend. Such price reversals would normally trigger the smaller stop loss of the short-term or day trader. Positions taken by long-term traders may be open for several days or longer, experiencing a fair number of reversals on the way to the take-profit target. Consequently, the wider stops would be preferable to this breed. Trailing Stop A trailing stop is often utilized in connection with the stop loss. Indeed, it would be futile to attempt the trailing stop without first setting the stop loss. That is because the main purpose of the trailing stop is to move the stop loss incrementally in the direction of the profit target as the currency price moves way. Such has the effect of incrementally bagging profits while the position remains open. The original stop loss level cannot be reached by the price reversal without the trader's position having first been closed automatically at the new stop loss level made possible by the trailing stop. In a news trading situation--generally characterized by rapid price movement--a trader would ideally utilize the smallest incremental trailing stop allowed. The smaller the trailing stop, the more possibility there is for making and keeping pips without being subjected to the vagaries of whipsaws or other rapid reversals in currency price. As in the case of the stop loss itself, a smaller trailing stop would be favored by the short-term trader. For example, instead of waiting for the price to move 20 pips before the stop loss is moved and the 20-pip profit realized, the trader can realize profits earlier by setting the trailing stop at 10 pips, with the expectation of bagging 10 pips with each 10-pip move in the currency price. Although it would be a trader's dream to have a trailing stop as low as 1 or 5, the lowest to be found on any broker's platform is probably 10. Still, by utilizing a well-place stop loss with the appropriate trailing stop, a trader can invest profitably and minimize the inevitable risks while preserving precious trading capital.

Hi What broker/software do you use for scalping? I have been trying MT4, but its very slow at handling SL/TP and multi-positions quickly. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Looked at a M5 chart with a 15 pips step. Look very promising. Money management exactly the same, scale out and trailing based on the 15 pips ... FerruFx

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Skovjuul May be it's better to use some different brokers. Oanda for EUR/USD (but Oanda offers only a leverage about 1:50), Dukascopy (JForex-Advantage: Java), Interactive Brokers. Activtrades offers an extra Account for Scalping. For scalping, you're best going with an MT4 ECN. Most ECNs generally have leverage of 100:1 or 50:1. I prefere a higher one around 1:400. One STP Broker is FXPrimus. Important topics are "No Slippage", "No/rarely Re/Misquotes", "Timely Execution". If I imagine my live brokers were running my stops I would remove my money very quickly. FXcube

For those who have problem scalping with their brokers, I would highly suggest to follow a higher chart with a higher grid (like the one I was talking in my previous post). It won't be considered scalping ...

The Best Forex Brokers for Scalping This article is part of our guide on how to use scalping techniques to trade forex. If you haven't already we recommend you read the first part of series on forex scalping . As important as basic concepts like leverage and spreads are for forex scalpers, they are still secondary subjects in comparison to issues related to the broker, his attitude and preferences. Quite simply, the broker is the most important variable determining the possibility, and profitability of a scalping strategy for any trader. A scalper has control over his strategies, stop loss, or take profit orders, as well as his time frame for trading, but he has no say in matters such as server stability, spreads, and the attitude of the broker to scalping. There are hundreds of brokers operating in the retail forex market today; naturally, each has a technical capability, and business model suitable to a different trader profile. These differences are immaterial to most long term traders, for swing traders they are meaningful but not that significant, but for day traders and scalpers they are the distinction between profit and loss. At the very basic level, the spread is a tax paid on profits and losses to the broker for his services, but the relationship goes a lot deeper than that. Let’s take a look at the various issues related to the scalper-broker relationship. (Once you've read this article make sure to stop by our forex broker review section to find more informations on the most popular retail forex brokers.) Low Spreads A trader who doesn’t use the scalping or day-trading strategies will open and close may be one or two positions, at most, in a single day. Although the cost of the spread is still an important variable, a successful trading style can easily justify the relatively small fees paid to the broker. The situation is quite different for the scalper however. Since the scalper will open and close tens of positions in a short period of time, the cost of his trades will be a very significant item on his balance sheet . Let’s see an example. Suppose that a scalper opens and liquidates 30 positions on a day in the EURUSD pair, for which the spread is commonly 3 pips. Let’s also suppose that his trade sizes are constant, and that 2/3 of his positions are profitable, with an average of 5 pips profit per trade. Let’s also say that the average size of his loss is 3 pips per trade. What is his net gain/loss without the cost of the spread included? (Positions in black) – (Positions in red) = Net profit/loss (20*5)-(10*3) = 70 pips in total. Which is a significant gain. Now let’s include the cost of the spread, and repeat the calculation. (Positions in black) – (Positions in red + Cost of the Spread) = Net profit/loss (20*5)-(10*3+30*3) = -20 pips in total. A nasty surprise awaits our hypothetical trader in his account. The number of his profitable trades were twice the number of his losing ones, and his average loss was about half his average gain. And in spite of that remarkable track record, his scalping activity gained him a net loss. To break even, he would need an average net profit of 9 pips per trade, all else remaining the same. Now let’s repeat the same calculation, with another hypothetical broker where the spread is just 1 pip in the EURUSD pair. The 5 pips per win, and 3 pips per loss (the same scenario which was examined in the beginning) with a one-pip spread would bring us an outcome of (20*5)-(10*3+30*1) = 60 pips in total profit. Why is there such a large discrepancy in our results? Although the numbers do speak for themselves, let’s remind the reader that while we earn money only on our profitable trades, we pay the broker for every position we open, profitable or not. And that is the problem. In sum, we need to ensure that we choose the broker with the lowest spread for the currency pair we’d like to trade. A scalper must scrutinize the account packages of different brokers thoroughly before deciding to become a client of one of them. Scalping Policy What is a scalping policy? Although the majority of well-established firms with a history and a significant client base have an official policy of allowing scalpers freedom with their decisions, some brokers quite simply refuse to allow scalping techniques for clients. Others process client orders slowly, and make scalping an unprofitable endeavor. What is the reason? In order to understand the cause of this, we should discuss how brokers net out their client’s positions before passing them to the banks. Supposing that a majority of a broker’s clients are losing money while trading, what would happen if at a time these losses were to reach such a large size that some triggered margin calls which could not be met? Since forex brokers are liable to liquidity provider banks for the profits or losses of their clients, they would have faced periodic crises of liquidity and even bankruptcy. In order to prevent such a situation from arising, brokers net-out the positions of clients by trading against them. That is, as a client opens a long position, the broker takes a short position, and vice versa. Since the result of two orders in the opposite direction is that the total exposure to the market is zero, the liquidity issue is resolved, and the firm is unimpacted by losses or profits in traders’ account. But there’s a problem with this situation. We mentioned that the broker countertrades its clients’ positions, and what if the client makes a profit by closing a long position, for instance. The broker then has to close the short trade which had been opened to net out the trader’s long trade, and while doing so he incurs a loss. And well, isn’t this a great incentive for forex brokers to ensure that their clients are constantly losing money? Well, not so much. First of all, most of the netting is done internally, where individual traders’ positions are netted out against each other without the broker having to commit any of its own funds. And the small remaining net position (the net long short or position that remains after the broker has netted out client orders against each other), is usually a losing position which can be counter-traded by the broker safely, because it is a well-established fact that the overwhelming majority of forex brokers lose money. Now that we understand that scalping does not necessarily constitute a problem for a competent broker (just like the occasional winners are not problem for casinos), we are ready to understand why some brokers dislike scalpers so much. As we said, the broker needs to net out trader positions against each other to guarantee that its liability against banks is minimal. Scalpers disrupt that plan by entering trades all over the place, at awkward times, with difficult sizes which not only forces the broker to commit its own capital at times, but also ensures that the system is bombarded with crowded trades. Add to that the possibility that the broker’s servers are not exactly lightning-fast, or modern enough to cope with the rapid flow of orders, and there you have profitable scalpers as the worst nightmare of a broker with a slow outdated system. Since scalpers enter many small, rapid positions over a short period of time, an incompetent broker is unable to cover its exposure efficiently, and sooner or later kicks the trader out by terminating his account, or slows down his access to the system so much that the scalper has to leave by his own account, due to his inability to trade. All this should make it clear that scalpers must trade with innovative, competent, and technologically alert brokers only, who possess the expertise and the technical capability to handle the large volume of orders arising from scalping activity. A no-dealing desk broker is almost a must for a scalper. Since trades are mostly automated in the system of a no-dealing desk(NDD) broker, there is little risk of external tampering as the system is left to sort out client orders on its own (still profitable of course). Strong technical tools Scalping involves technical trading. In the very short time frames preferred by scalpers, fundamentals have no impact on trading. And when they do have, market reaction to them is erratic and entirely unpredictable. As such, a sophisticated technical package which supplies an adequate number of technical tools is a clear necessity for any scalper. In addition, since the trader will spend a considerable amount of time gazing at the screen, reading quotes, opening and closing positions, it is a good idea to choose an interface that is not too wearying on the eyes. A bright, graphically intense platform may be pleasant to use and look at at first, but after long hours of intense concentration, the visual appeal will be more of a burden than a benefit. Also, a platform that allows the simultaneous display of multiple time frames can be very useful for a scalper as he monitors price movements on the same screen. Although scalping involves short term trading, awareness of the price action on longer timeframes can be beneficial for money management, and strategical planning. No slippage, no misquotes, timely execution We have mentioned in the section on brokers’ scalping policies that a scalper must always seek a competent, modern broker in order to ensure that his trading style and practices are welcome. But timely execution, and precise quotes are also important for ensuring that a trader can profit with a scalping strategy. Since the scalper trades many times in the short time frame of an hour, he must receive timely, correct quotes on a system which allows rapid reaction. If there’s slippage, the scalper will be unable to trade most of the time. If there are misquotes, he will suffer losses so often that trading will be impractical. And we should not neglect the emotional pressures which will be caused by such a stressful, difficult, and inefficient trading environment either. Scalping is already a burdensome activity on one’s nerves, and we should not agree to suffer the added trouble of broker incompetence on top of all the other problems which we have. To conclude this section, we’ll add that scalping is a high-intensity technical trading method which requires a highly competent and efficient broker with state-of-the-art tools. Anything less will diminish your profits, and increase your problems. Next: The Best Currencies for Scalping Forex Risk Statement: Trading Foreign Exchange on margin carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The possibility exists that you could lose more than your initial deposit. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. http://www.forextraders.com/forex-st...-scalping.html

FXcube, In the attached example, do you consider to exit and reverse the trade ... or once a trade is in progress, you let it closes (scale out, trailing, etc ...) first, then wait for the next opportunity ? FerruFx

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I would trade in this way. Enter Short at Line 2, set SL at Line 1, if the Candle crosses Line 3, trail the SL at Line 2 (= first TS),...,if the Candle crosses Line 4, set the Trailing Stop (= second TS) at Line 3,..., and so on. See the Chart below, please. EURUSD-M5-15-Grid-Box-Scalping If you like more to trade the EURUSD, M5 at 15 Grid maybe I would prefere the Strategy described in # 42 . Hope it helps! Fxcube

--- 帖子 #42 ---
EURUSD, M5, Grid 15 By using a M5 Chart with a 15 Grid Box maybe it's better to scalping in the following way: This Design point out an Enter at the next Line after the HL-Candle* with the stop loss below sea level (the next Line down, say the Bottom Line). Example: Candle 1 HL* &gt; Enter Long at Line 2 (1.4145) and set a Stop Loss at Line 1 (1.4130) and apply the Trailing Stop Concept. Candle 2 HL* &gt; Enter Long at Line 3 (1.4160) and set a Stop Loss at Line 2 (1.4145) by following the Trailing Stop Concept. ... Candle 6 HL* &gt; Enter Long at Line 3 and set a Stop Loss at Line 2 and make use of the Trailing Stop. Label *HL = Higher Low. The Example below indicates only the Enter Longs.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Ok so you wait the Short trade to close and only then look for the Long entry.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I trade the M1-5-Grid/10Grid in this way, yes!, often simultaneously! ..., but why not Enter before an Exit. Feel free to do it and make your experience. It shouldn't be unfavorable with a M5-15-Grid-Design. Fxcube

It would appear that the best way to trade this scalp method would be to trade only with the short term trend, for the new traders anyway as trading retractments are at best dangerous. Therefore I have posted a indicator that may help with following the trend. As always if this is seen as being of topic, please feel free to remove this post.

so what is the best box size?

iamloco M1-Grid-M5/M10 Scalping produce more Trading Stress than a M5-Grid-15 Trading. No doubt! It isn't a matter of "best box size". Both have benifits. Scalping at M1 demands more Lotsizes as would be desirable most of the time than M5 Trading. FXcube

Hi Forexhard You are working aginst every thread I've opened. Okay maybe I am the bad boy and you are the hero. I can only repeat me: "Make a psychotherapie"! ...and go out of my life! http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=308286

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Okay, then I will write a *.doc-file, step by step. Beforehand A "fulfilled Box" is a field where the market price tend to reverse in the counterpart direction and is crossing a Grip-Line. There you have also set the Stop Loss at its Bottom (by Enter Long Orders) or at the Top (when going Short). Let's say it's the Starting Point (Area) of every Order and every Trailing Stop. Sometimes when the market gets more volatile it could be built more a "fuzzy set" a vague form when could not be exactly determined if it might be set one grid more up or one more down. I will describe these market environments more next week when Forex has opened the doors. Then we can see more the mechanics in practice. FXcube

Excursus: Catch Turning Points In The Forex Market Any time the currency trends in a specific direction and then clearly changes direction and trends in the opposite direction is referred to as Trading turning points. Forex treaders often refer to retracement or bounce trading as turning point trading. In order to catch and trade turning points in the market one has to understand what makes the market move. The only way market movements can occur is by the buy and sell order flow into the Forex market. It is as simple as that. You therefore have to become an expert at understanding how the market responds to these sell and buy orders and where they are likely to accumulate. There are four major groups of market participants who cause orders to be placed in the Forex Market. The first group consist of the major banks and institutions. The market moves as a result of their actions. You better believe this for your own trading sanity. How often have you been in a transaction which is going nicely positive for an hour or so and then suddenly goes thirty to fifty pips against you for no apparent reason? There was no announcement. There was no major support or resistance where the price turned. It was not at a special time of day such as a market opening or close or an annoucement time i.e. market opening. One of these big players may just have placed a hundred million order in the market.Often these big players did not like the direction of a particular market trend and then boldly introduced a huge amount of orders in the opposite direction. When the price is just drifting around these orders have an overwhelming impact and will reverse the market or start a trend. The risk in not that great and often these deal go positive within minutes. This happens six to eight times a day and explains why in spite of following your trading plan to the letter your deals go bad. These moves can be traded if your broker supplies volume information and often you will see the volume go up before the trend moves. The second group are orders placed by participants in the market based on Technical Analysis approaches. These orders are placed at various strategic price levels and act as entry orders or stop orders. These orders accumulate around support and resistance levels in the market. This explains why when a certain price level is reached there is often a big move in the market as all these orders are activated at the same time. You need to be competent at identifying these support and resistance levels so that you can anticipate these moves. A large part of the market movement is based on these price levels. Round number price levels, Fibonacci levels, Pivot points and historic support and resistance levels are used by traders to trade these levels. The third group are orders that are placed in the market as a result of economic announcements and news. These orders can move the market over one hundred pips in two minutes and can also reverse the market over two hundred pips in the next five minutes. They are orders that are placed as a result of the fear and greed reactions to current news. You need to watch the economic announcements schedule closely to make sure you are not adversely affected by these orders. It is better not to trade these probable whipsaw moves. The fourth group are orders that are processed by the financial institutions based on their actual need to buy and sell currencies in order to settle commercial trade transactions or investment money movement transactions. When financial markets open and when they are about to close, are times when these transactions can occur. This explains how trends can occur at these times. Using the order flow behaviour in the Forex market as mentioned above has helped many traders understand the price movements and has given them the ability to take advantage of these opportunities. http://www.articlealley.com/catch-tu...t-2065867.html

Buy Stop Order http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg What Does Buy Stop Order Mean? An order to buy a security which is entered at a price above the current offering price. It is triggered when the market price touches or goes through the buy stop price. http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg Investopedia explains Buy Stop Order People using a buy stop hope to gain if momentum gains on a particular stock. If the price exceeds the price you have set, it will automatically trigger a market order http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buystoporder.asp

Thank you r2997790! I have trade this more in combination with the pivotal points and M5 at the Beginning 2008. M1 is in my practice since the beginning of the financial turmoils in the markets and I feel lucky about it. When a trend is coming up often candles are getting longer and you have to trade faster. May be you could missed the first fulfilled box. If so go in one Grid Stair later then at this strategy. The ratio of success depends at my Risk-Management. Near the Pivotal Points I tend to enter in the market with higher lotsizes, so the Profit Data depends more of my Risk-Style with the Focus of the Capital Gain. But why not counting the pips in the next days? Good idea! Sideway market When market runs sideway the candles are getting smaller. It's not the best time for BoxScalping, maybe with a tighter Grid-Band (e.g. M1,Grid-2 or Grid-3) for catching ~1-3 pips. Fxcube

I have make often the comment "if you scalp the whole day long, you could lose money!" Then again there is an estimating the effect of a market environment (e.g. Volatility, Momentum). The next weeks one aspect could be working out the most helpful market environment for make use of Scalping Strategies. Simple and efficient: I tend to make things so simple as possible. So I look at the bodies and the shadows of the candles and its gradient. Fxcube

How To Place Orders With A Forex Broker Posted: Sep 25, 2010 When you place orders with a forex broker, it is extremely important that you know how to place them appropriately. Orders should be placed according to how you are going to trade - that is, how you intend to enter and exit the market. Improper order placement can skew your entry and exit points. In this article, we'll cover some of the most common forex order types. (For the latest discussions about forex, check out the forums at TradersLaboratory.com ) Types of Orders: Market Order This is the most common type of order. A market order is used when you want to execute an order immediately at the market price, which is either the displayed bid or the ask price on your screen. You may use the market order to enter a new position (buy or sell) or to exit an existing position (buy or sell). (For more insight, see The Basics Of Order Entry and Understanding Order Execution .) Stop Order A stop order is an order that becomes a market order only once a specified price is reached. It can be used to enter a new position or to exit an existing one. A buy-stop order is an instruction to buy a currency pair at the market price once the market reaches your specified price or higher, which is higher than the current market price. A sell-stop order is an instruction to sell the currency pair at the market price once the market reaches your specified price or lower, which is lower than the current market price. Stop orders are commonly used to enter a market when you trade breakouts . For example, suppose that USD/CHF is rallying toward a resistance level and, based on your analysis, you think that if it breaks above that resistance level, it will continue to advance higher. To trade this opinion, you can place a stop-buy order a few pips above the resistance level so that you can trade the potential upside breakout. If the price later reaches or surpasses your specified price, this will open your long position . An entry stop order can also be used if you want to trade a downside breakout. Place a stop-sell order a few pips below the support level so that when the price reaches your specified price or goes below it, your short position will be opened. Stop orders are used to limit your losses . Everyone has losses from time to time, but what really affects the bottom line is the size of your losses. Before you even enter a trade, you should already have an idea of where you are going to exit your position should the market turn against it. One of the most effective ways of limiting your losses is through a predetermined stop order, which is commonly referred to as a stop-loss . If you have a long position on, say the USD/CHF, you will want to the pair to rise in value. In order to avoid the possibility of chalking up uncontrolled losses, you can place a stop-sell order at a certain price so that your position will automatically be closed out when that price is reached. A short position will have a stop-buy order instead. Stop orders can be used to protect profits . Once your trade becomes profitable, you may shift your stop-loss order in the profitable direction so as to protect some of your profit. For a long position that has become very profitable, you may move your stop-sell order from the loss to the profit zone to safeguard against the chance of realizing a loss in case your trade does not reach your specified profit objective, and the market turns against your trade. Similarly, for a short position that has become very profitable, you may move your stop-buy order from loss to the profit zone in order to protect your gain. (To read more about setting stops, see Stop Hunting With The Big Players .) Limit Order A limit order is placed when you are only willing to enter a new position or to exit a current position at a specific price or better. The order will only be filled if the market trades at that price or better. A limit-buy order is an instruction to buy the currency pair at the market price once the market reaches your specified price or lower, and is lower than the current market price. A limit-sell order is an instruction to sell the currency pair at the market price once the market reaches your specified price or higher, and it is higher than the current market price. Limit orders are commonly used to enter a market when you fade breakouts . You fade a breakout when you don't expect the currency price to break successfully past a resistance or a support level. In other words, you expect that the currency price will bounce off the resistance to go lower, or bounce off the support to go higher. For example, suppose that based on your analysis of the market, you think that USD/CHF's current rally move is unlikely to break past a resistance successfully. Therefore, you think that it would be a good opportunity to short when USD/CHF rallies up to near that resistance. You can then place a limit-sell order a few pips below that resistance level so that your short order will be filled when the market moves up to that specified price or higher. Besides using the limit order to go short near a resistance, you can also use this order to go long near a support level. For instance, if you think that there is a high probability that USD/CHF's current decline will pause and reverse near a particular support level, you may want to take the opportunity to long when USD/CHF declines to near that support. In this case, you can place a limit-buy order a few pips above that support level so that your long order will be filled when the market moves down to that specified price or lower. Limit orders are used to set your profit objective. Before placing your trade, you should already have an idea of where you want to take profits should the trade go your way. A limit order allows you to exit the market at your pre-set profit objective. If you long a currency pair, you will use the limit-sell order to place your profit objective. If you go short, the limit-buy order should be used to place your profit objective. Note that these orders will only accept prices in the profitable zone. Execute the Correct Orders Having a firm understanding of the different types of orders will enable you to use the right tools to achieve your intentions - how you want to enter the market (trade or fade), and how you are going to exit the market (profit and loss). While there may be other types of orders, market, stop and limit orders are the most common of them all. Be comfortable using them because improper execution of orders can cost you money.

It's nice of you to show that all BUT the problem still remains (and that could be the rating only 4 stars ): WHERE do you draw the boxes ? Of course there "possible" turning points but there are moves where market fakes a lot (like last week sometimes). Even worser: Imagine a SL of 10 Pips, go in because market shows a possible reversal and the market does that 4 times. (happenes at least 1-2 times per month). So your down 40 pips. Besides, another problem is the TP. That's the biggest problem I think. Of course you can scale out/trailing out but LOOK AT LAST WEEK. Often you get trailed out a lot because of fast market movement and then continuation. The Idea of the system is nice and yes you can earn money with it but you have to be a real pro ,- no an ace of reading marketconditions like PA and so on but then you don't need the boxes no anymore. It's a nice gimmick, yes, because a "box" give you some easy looking trend window, SL and when to enter but it's worthless unless you are not able to identify trend reversals and this can only do 5% of the readers here I guess, excluding me. Just a thought ! Thanks anyway, Jack

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Another thing: If "box" drawing aiming for trend reversal than there's a very easy tactic: Just enter the market in the next candle (1 minute/5 minute) when this candle moves against the current trend a least 10 pips and set the SL on the high/low of the "reverse"candle (e.g. 12 SL + 1 spread = 13). Under normal conditions you get stopped out 1 or 2 times, than market reverse for 30 pips may be if you entered. But again: where to set TP, where a trailing stop and so on...position management is the key, not the entry. these are the essential things and this can only know people who are real pros. I know some stuff about that but it's so little that I cannot be profitable trading this way.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Look at the chart then you see what I mean Made a little mistake: not -10 pips on the first 3 positions but -5 to -6 pips. Anyway I think the problem I mentioned is clear .

--- 帖子 #77 ---
If you please, it's best when we talk about the correct version. Isn't it JackintheBox? Enter Short Order Profit: +60 pips by Option B (e.g. 3 x 0.1 Lot size) - and with 1 x Short Order: +30 Pips (minus the Spread). FXcube

--- 帖子 #78 ---
not too sure what this is but hey good luck to you all...... i think it is similar to what zebulan came up with albeit on a smaller time frame.

See # 6 Example EURUSD, M1, Box Scalping with the help of the CCI Divergence. ...so also at M5 by switching between the Timeframes. Why not? Feel free to adapt the Box-Scalping-System at your personality.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Ok, that's exactly what I mean. If you look at my Boxes, they are different to yours because I use mechanical entrys (higher Lows, Lower Highs). You use additional stuff to draw boxes and that's the difficulty and this can no one tell you where to draw them except you know the TURNING POINTS. (and that is the hard part which cannot be solved by boxes, that's what I meant) greets Jack You are able to draw such boxes with nice turns but lots of people cannot do this cause they simply don't know when there's a turn (look again at my boxes, you never know when it turns)

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Jack I understand your statements very well but your arguments don't seems logical for me for three reasons. First: Your boxes aren't right. See my corrected design further up, # 79 , # 77 . Second: Most of the trader know that after a big move the market is often falling in a consolidation phase, so not the best opportunity to scalp the 10-Grid-Design. Third: You take one example with Higher Lows (e.g., # 71 ) and apply it at all market environments. Absolutely not! It's at the outset to explain the research criteria for setting the best fulfilling boxes (although this design aren't eligible for the Holy Grail). I have described only one aspect for setting a Box. Give me time to explain it more in detail here at board, please ...but if you have placed the Box everybody knows what is to do. Where to set the Box is the topic which has more point out here at this board when following the price process, because everybody would set it at another place. That's absolutely right! FXcube

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Okay may be it's better then we made here an end of all further discussion about the topic where could set a qualified turning point (a Fulfilled Box)! It's the essence of all forex workers to point out where Market turns. It isn't so difficult and traders who won't learn it couldn't trade successfully. If so then all strategies might be a risky system moreover the Holy Grail don't exist. Coming back to your example: You have it apply in the wrong way and you know it! What a pity! FXcube

EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 08 Live Trading Enter Long at 1.4270 Stop Loss @ 1.4250 (by using the Triling Stop). (Next Pivotal is mR1 1.4289). Why set the SL 10 Pips below the "Fulfilled Box" (-20 Pips/1.4250) and not at the Bottom of it (1.4260)? Market seems to move in a sideway direction with no Vola and no Momentum and it is lunchtime. Price Movement between a 20 Pip Range seems more possible at this market environment, ... or you don't trade this market situation never ever.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi FXC. I'm really looking forward to testing this system in my week off - next week . A confirmation of the above example: As I have understood you would go long at 1.42600, stop loss at 1.42500, take profit at 1.4270 (half and let the other half run after moving SL to 1.42600) From your picture it looks like you have just gone long at 1.42700, but then I would be vary of the possible resistance at that level (half an hour earlier). Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi Skovjuul You could do in your described manner a little time before (see the chart below, please), but then I wasn't sit in front of my monitor to take the better chance. This was my intention. e.g. Option B (3 x 0.1 Lot) Go Long @ 1.4270 Stop Loss @ 1.4250 Take Profit @ 1.4280 (first x 0.1) Trailing Stop @ 1.4260 if 1.4280 has reached.

Thanks ForexCube for sharing your thoughts. I have to admit that I exaggerate my examples, yes but I neede to do this so it's clear what I meant. I'm just studying different turning points/possibilies and their some hints but I have to learn more a about that. Thanks also for live trading ! I guess you need statistical skills and a "feeling" for a possible turn and as you showed it's worth 30 pips or more, so 2 fake-ins are ok approx. to get a well CR-Ratio of 1.5 (Gain/loss) . What I recognized is that their often a turning point in market between Europe and open of Us-Session, good to trade I take that sometimes. Greets JAck

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Jack I think when we put our experience together we could work out these Turning Points with a/the higher/est Probability of Success to get an even better CR-Ratio (over 1.5). I will explain my concepts of turning points in the next weeks here at board. Hope you and others could make the same. The FF Members could chose among these concepts all these ones which fit the best for themselves. I like your point of view. You're wellcome! Best regards FXcube

It's a good time for making some pips, no doubt!,...also when the market is closing. FXcube

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I've read through the entire thread and it's still unclear why you choose to make one area a box and not another. Do you wait for price to hit one side of a box bounce off, then break through the other? Maybe it's a language barrier, when you say, "fufilled box," do you mean a, "filled box" As in the box was filled then broke out one way or another?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
It's subjectively where you earmark the "Fulfilled Box" where no candles has to hit the contrary side before (don't bother!). JackInTheBox has pointed out the importance of the Turning Point otr the "subjectivity" of placing a "Fulfilled Box". If you have identify a Turning Point (often as an Entry with a higher Probability of making a Profit) then you can fill this Grid Area with color ("Fulfilled Box") and you can set a Stop Loss, a Stop Sell or a Stop Buy, a Trailing Stop, and the first and second Take Profit Levels and the last Exit Level (third Order Exit), e.g. when trading "Option B" (3 x 0.1 lot) in the trot. With a script it should going faster and easier. What's more you can go in a trend with an Entry Order. In this case (market situation) doesn't need every "Fulfilled Box" a Turning Point. FXcube

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Turning Point a point at which there is a change in direction or motion. To think of Pivotal Points as Turning Points could be often the right way of making a profit.

Forex Pivot Points http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009.../book_icon.jpg What Does Forex Pivot Points Mean? A set of indicators developed by floor traders in the commodities markets to determine potential turning points , also known as "pivots". Forex pivot points are calculated to determine levels in which the sentiment of the market could change from "bullish" to "bearish." Currency traders see pivot points as markers of support and resistance. Forex pivot points are calculated as the average of the high, low and close from the previous trading session: Forex Pivot Point = (High + Low + Close) / 3 http://i.investopedia.com/inv/092009...y/inv_icon.jpg Investopedia explains Forex Pivot Points Because pivot points are thought to work well in very liquid markets, the spot forex market may be the perfect place to use them. Day traders use the calculated pivot points to determine levels of entry, stops and profit taking by trying to determine where the majority of other traders may be doing the same. Forex pivot point calculators are available free of charge across the internet through retail forex brokers and third-party websites. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/fo...vot-points.asp

The task is to find out areas with a higher likelihood of making a profit when scalping at M1. I will give more examples next time. FXcube

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Dynamical Scalping Example Dynamical Scalping could be described as a subform style of "Box Scalping". The "Fulfilled Boxes" were placed with the Top &amp; Bottoms of CCI(14) around a Pivotal Point outside of London Market Time. Within these marks many Orders have executed. (When trading with higher Lotsizes it's crucial to trade with max. 1.0/1.5 Spread) . Profit: + 8'226.-$ FXcube

--- 帖子 #107 ---
A few questions: 1. Is this a live account and not a demo account. 2. why the odd lot sizes, I see you go from 2-8 pip size. Is that just spreading our your risk over your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I'll never publish real account at FF, KumoDragon. It's more a security question! If you ask other traders if they like to do it! Most of them would say: "No!", Do you see Real Accounts with big Deposits at FF anywhere? FXcube

--- 帖子 #109 ---
No, just for fun! I look more at the money which I could (and have) made by every trade. Every order is like a tankership on the ocean waiting for the discharge cargo. When I go in the market with a couple of orders at once I can go out with some of them earlier without any limit orders of Option B (3 x 0.1). That's for me dynamical Box Scalping. FXcube

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So, basically you are just looking for what looks like some sort of small turning point or pivot and using the last box as a starting point and stop loss, wether both sides were hit or not? Then using connecting boxes as the trail?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes, yes I have seen traders posting real accounts. As long as you don't divulge the account # and passwords you wouldn't have any problems with someone trying to hack your account. I'm trading an account with about 10K in it, doesn't bother me one bit to tell anyone here no way they can hack me or hurt me. The reason I asked is, it's been my personal experience that what works well in demo rarely works as well live. Especially when it's scalping with a tight stop. So, I wanted to see if you were doing this for real or were just doing it on demo. Are you doing it with a live account at all? If not why even bother trying to promote it on FF. Kind of misleading. Some people assume that if you are promoting a method, that the promoter must have some REAL success with it. So, if you are not it's kind of misleading. I'm not trying to be rude in your thread. I just wanted to know if you are currently having similar results live, as I find the concept interesting. But, don't want to waste more time downloading the indicators and testing it with small lot sizes, if all you have ever done is traded demo. If you are live with this, are you having similar results as your demo?

EURUSD, M1-Grid-5 Example Turning Points are working out with the help of M1 Trendlines. The "Fulfilled Boxes" were placed then one (or two) Grid-5 over the Price-Trendline-Crossover. The "Fulfilled Box" will create at the moment of the Crossover, not before. Trade only for 3-8 Pips in a Ranging Market outside of London Market Time. (It's crucial to trade with max. 1.0/1.5 Spread) . The Chart below illustrates Enter Short Trade Possibilities.

The Combination of the strategies # 106 , # 118 will give you the chance to go in the Market with more Entry Orders at different Distance Travelled Points.

Thanks for excellent post. I seem to remember there's a script where you can execute buy/sell limit/stop order just by clicking on a line placed on a chart. But I can't recall what it's called.

Good morning, Forexcube! It's 2.26 am (GMT +1) here in Graz Austria. Today i make my first post on Forex Factory. Since 2009 I am member of this website,but I preferred to remain "in shadow"in this time.I have read hundreds of pages of forums,learning step by step the thorny path of forex. And still are far from the truth! A few words about me: I have 32 years, 2 children (a boy 2 years and 5 months young, and a and a daughter 5 months young). I have a full time job in the steel industry.By accident 3 years ago, coming home I found a newspaper in a bus station.having enough time (for the next bus), I browsed the newspaper. So I found an article about Forex. I know it sounds stupid this story,but so I got in touch with Forex. no friends, no knowledge, no tips about FX.Because of the job, I realized that i can only trade in small windows of time.So pretty much everything I could find for the small time window:Using indicators and systems from THV,MissPips, LOHAD, Madscalper,Choros,NiceGuy,flag the trend ,Swiss Army (i mean ..indy ) and the good old Cave. But I must admit, I love your " box". for that I take my hat off ! I need time to fully understand how it works.(because of work!) By the way! I'm crazy about Rivella ! I ask my brother (who lives in Switzerland) to send me two boxes every months by a truck driver ! I apologize if I was boring ,i upset someone and excuse my English. Have a full month of valuable pips ! Ich wünsche Ihnen alles Gute ! Nico (Graz-Austria)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I prefer to test something new (new indi ,sistems) in real account , although there is a risk to "burn" a small account. I prefer to be confident with the "loss of earnings"in real acount , than optimistic with "potential gains" in demo (hurts harder if you slam head against the wall later...) Money management is for me the holy grail.... just dare anyone to contradict me ... I wish you all a full month of the valuable pips! Nico

--- 帖子 #124 ---
thanks Forexcube, but not quite what i had in mine. What I'd like is, you draw a line where you want to buy/sell on limit/stop order on the chart. And from this line you attach a script on it it then will set a pending market order at the price level of the line. I'll have to search in my indis/scripts graveyard, now that your strategy looks promising !

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Oh sorry, Maybe it's this one! http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=98061 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=292330 Try it at the FF Search Field with "Buy Order Chart" or "Script Tailing Stop Chart" or so...

I must apologize Forexcube, I did not say thank you for this wonderful piece of soft. mea suscipiet coeptus ?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hey tiger saw your question and thought i may have something which may be of use to you... They are both scripts which go in experts/scripts folder, then you just drag the script onto your chart where you want to setup the pending buy or sell order.. a dialog comes up once you drag the script onto where you want the order to be placed to ask for take profit/stop loss and lot size... Hope it may be useful.. josh

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I'm looking for a Script or EA that will buy/sell at the breach of a horizontal line (or at the touch with the mouse in the chart) that you place on a chart. The script or EA would also let you place automatically a stop loss 10 pips above the Entry and take 2 profit lines (1 order at +10 points, second order at +20 points) on the chart and will runing a Trailing Stop 10 Points after the actual price when the price is running in the next Grid Box and this Trailing Stop as also execute the last (third) Order. So that before the trade, you could easily place the three lines (entry, SL, TP and later the Trailing Stop) on the chart and move them around at will. Are here some good experienced programmers who could write this Script or EA for EURUSD, M1? Kindest regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Oh it's an interesting time running with two children through the world and have the honour of upbringing. When I read your post I'm having flashbacks of my own beautiful life with the difference, when I was 32 there was no special Forex Market at the heaven which you could use in a right way and my daughter was coming on the world and the son 2 years moments later! Congratulation!. If you have had an accident I'm sure you have got some inputs more about the meaning of life. Time flies! Best wishes to Austria and a special greetings to Graz. FXcube

--- 帖子 #132 ---
This an amazing idea!, especially with the trailing stop after the third box. I know a programmer off of odesk that would probably do this for $125, I just might have to commission this script, or if anyone wants to go half-sies on it;-) Any other options, ideas, or rules you want this script to do? This thread is really progressing Cube! Are you creating a pdf for this?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Forexcube, try this one, it's EA and you can adjust lines just by dragging. If I get time this week I might add to open 2 positions at same time for 2 profit levels. Or you should ask Steve H. he might get on board with EA.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
A *.pdf-file? Oh yes, sure. May be in autumn when it's getting colder here in Switzerland.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Thank you , I appreciate it. May be I could find other programmers who do it for free just out of curiosity. May be I write a script when I have more time. I don't think so that it's difficult. I don't know! Best regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Accept my thanks for this beautiful EA. I will test it out and will give you a feed-back. Thank you! It would be great if I could find more time to learn the mq4 (C++) from the ground up. Maybe every day 30 minutes or so. But MT5 is not the same code, is't it? ...might be it could be better at all learning "JAVA"? ..and will be a time come when C++ is out and JAVA is in for MT4? Best regards Fxcube

EURUSD, M1, Grid-5, 2011 August 09 Example Short in...short out,...within 5 minutes. It's not neccesarily to trade the whole day long. When scalping it could be also an excellent idea to wait for an Entry Chance with a higher Probability of Success. What you have to do then is: Hop in the market collect your Pips and jump out as fast as you can when trading with higher Lot Sizes. The Market environment below indicates a sideway. A little later it was broken down till 1.4210. When scalping it's important to set a Stop Loss. Profit: + 1'389 $ (within 5 minutes).

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Example EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 09 ...and the story goes on Why was the Stop Loss set 5 points under the Bottom of the "Fulfilled Box"? Inasmuch as it seems that the market has indicated a higher volatility. Profit: +1'573.- $

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Be careful, please! If you try to scalp the whole day long maybe you could lose your money! Why? Scalping Strategies don't show you the bigger trend. It's more like a flap of a butterfly, a wing beat!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi Forexcube, The templates you provided, there isn't any indicator. How did you make the grid ?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
....also, from your charts, you have a 4 digits broker ? so on the template you gave it should work with 5 digits broker i think. still perplex about your template though.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I could rewrite it for both of them. Thank's!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Like this # 28 . Not so smart! I know!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have been looking for this functionality for quite a while so thank you for this. I can't seem to get it to work though. I have installed it in my MT4 but how do I use it? I have tried dragging it onto the chart but nothing happens. I have tried opening a position and then adjusting the SL/TP by dragging the lines but nothing... Please help

--- 帖子 #145 ---
So put it in your expert folder, then when you place it on chart it shows 2 lines (green/red) buy stop and sell stop, which are dragable, move it where you want to be and then it will self adjust orders. Works fine on FXDD, if doesn't works in your case maybe is broker thing .. not sure ..

Hi altoronto I'm not sure what you mean with 5,5,3. I change these parameters since I have a 5- or 10-Grid and I change the size of the chart, ....and take a look at # 57 (M1-Grid-10 with the Grid Builder: Grid Space Value 100 / M1-Grid-5, use Grid Space Value 200), please. Hope it helps! FXcube

Live Trading Dynamical Box Scalping EURUSD, M1, Grid-5, 2011 August 10 (~14:00 GMT+2) Long @ 1.4350 SL @ 1.4345 It's more ranging so I'll try to trade a dynamical box scalping and only for several pips (1-5 pips) and let the other trades run to 1.4355, 1.4360, may be further on.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Result 15 minutes later. Profit: +30 pips You dont have to wait if the Stop Loss has triggered, when scalping dynamically. Often it's so that the Market could change when New York opens the market (see # 158 ). Get out as soon as possible. Profit is Profit! It doesn't matter how many. If you take out it several a day (additively here 15 pips, there 5 pips, then 30 pips and so on...) you could earn enough money.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
...and a little later? Market has suddenly turn around after New York Open Time. Here you could realize also the importance of a Trailing Stop. For me it's not the question if I have passed the profit when the market turns abrupt and are running extremely in the contrary direction. Of course not!,... except if you are a clairvoyant. Take it easy. Next chance will come!

Hi Forexcube ! Awesome, really great your trades. I have huge problems by shorting "tops" or "bottoms", to get filled by market (I don't like because I enter only on consolidation, forex often snaps back). Of course, if you're so experienced like you forex is fun I think ! Keep it up !

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi JackintheBox! Maybe try to trade only in an uptrend or downtrend when prices comes back to a support or resistance line, or widen the boxes at 15/20 pips and go at M5/M15/M30/H1, and/or try it with other currency pairs. If you don't have a good feeling by Box Scalping let it be. There are so much other efficient strategies at FF or put here and there something together and create your own system. Why not? The important thing is that you feel good by yourself when trading. You're wellcome! Best regards FXcube

Hi FXcube, How do you set the chart like this:

Hi FerruFx, Thanks for your respond. But what I want to know is setting the chart with fix vertical price scale with different 5 or 10 point.

I found another EA which I think is perfect for box-scalping. Its the Visual Trade Closer from Forexbrace. http://www.forexbrace.com/content/view/231/77/ This one show a TP and SL line on your chart and you can move them around with your mouse, making it extremely easy to move your SL and TP one box at a time. Give it a whirl, its perfect for scalping. Kind regards.

From what I can tell, this system is really a Renko system without the Renko chart. I have worked for a long time trying to get a Renko System to be profitable. Best I can get is PF = 1.12 - 1.2 which is far from my goal of PF = 2. All of the pips from a trend is great, but ranging kills all those pips deader than a door nail. If you are looking for an easy way to see a reversal, Renko is a easy way to see this. KingHigh

--- 帖子 #174 ---
KingHigh, I would tend to agree with you... when the market is trending systems like this and renko are excellent. So, the key focus should be entry criteria, ie. when the market is trending, so you only trade at optimum times. Give there's 24/5 hours of trading and any number of pairs there should be no shortage of opportunties.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
The only way for trending strategies to be profitable (significantly) is to trade only withing trending condition ... So the only key is to define the ranging market to avoid it. Once this is done, any trending strategy will be profitable ... FerruFx

This is a very interesting approach. I will study it and perhaps comment.

EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 17 Some traders here don't know where to find the right entry point. Maybe CCI(14) could be a help for you by switching between M1 and M5. Then you could also trade some M1 divergences like in the frame below. It's absolutely equal if the market price would go more down (e.g. till mS1 1.4368). If you scalp the forex market you will make some points here and some points there. I tend to trade more this kind of scalping stlyle: The first thing to do when scalping the forex market is... Wait! Do not trade every market situation which seems to have a higher probability of success. Choose only these ones with the highest probabilities of a profit return and go in with higher lot sizes.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
very good strategy - very powerful thank u

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanks for the great method ForexCube =) Missed 2 trades with this otherwise I would have had over 30 pips for the day but caught one quicky. Went long on the Euro around 31 and took out at 40. There was a support level below that got hit for the 3rd time with a pinbar and my entry was at the Break of a small trendline with the candle closing over the grid line. I think with patience only taking trades with easy to see support or resistance areas combined with some trendlines may work out to be profitable. Cheers for sharing your knowledge FC, God bless you.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
my stop was near a recent low, around 24. So i used a stop less then 10 pips as I saw fit. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Another one...Price made a pinbar on a support area with the end of the Pinbar on the black Grid Line, the 2nd candle closed over my blue box drawn by my Support/Res indy which is a buy signal for me, and the CCI 14 being oversold, looks good for a quick buy. Good for a quick 8 pips. Heres the chart.

Hey FerruFX, First of all thank you for all your great work on this wonderful forum. I need a little help to code an indicator into a EA (which i and my friends have tried to program more than thrice and failed! I think this must be a piece of cake for you though!) When we tried to convert the indicator into EA it produced very strange results compared to the indicator (i.e.Working of the indicator changed mysteriously and produced different signals other than the normal indicator.) We want the EA to follow the rules mentioned below : 1. Should take the trades based only on the 1Hr timeframe . 2. The trade should be opened only, after the closing of the current candle(signal candle/ arrow candle) at the opening of the next candle(To avoid false signals). 3. Lot size - to be determined by the trader in the inputs in settings dialog box. 3. Stoploss - 50 pips 4. Target price set to 50 pips should increase by 50 after every 50 pips achieved. 5. Trade Exit Criteria - (i)If opposite direction signal occurs close trade after closing of the current signal candle and opening of the new candle(To avoid false signals). (ii)Trailing stoploss 30 pips or 50 pips, whichever is suitable. 6. Max open positions = 2. Please take care that the indicator's working and code is not altered so that it does not affect the performance. If you have any doubts please feel free to let me know or contact me - mane.shreyash@gmail.com . I have attached the indicator below Thanking you in advance. Regards, Shreyash

--- 帖子 #188 ---
No probs FC, Cudn't resist another trade, took the euro short around 53 when I got a pinbar just out of my resistance area, marked the entry with a vertical line....Just took profit at around 31 right now... Im done and very happy for the day. I will hunt patiently for more opportunitys tomorrow. Thanks again

EURUSD, M5, 2011 August 19 Trade Example Box Scalping with CCI &amp; the Pivotals Often you can see that the market price will go ~10/20 pips over the Pivotal Point. Often it's better to set the "Fulfilled Box" above the Pivotal and the Stop Loss de novo higher. Experienced Traders don't wait sometimes to the Trailing Stop and go out of the market before the Trailing Stop could be triggered., (e.g. at DS1 1.4329) and take some pips more along (+11 Pips, Total: +81 Pips).

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi Shreyash "Box Swinging" or "Box Trading" at H1,... why not? If so there could be trade all currency pairs. The spread wouldn't be so important any longer. Thank you for this work! Shreyash, could it be a possibility for you to upload the *.mq4 format so that everybody could read the code. Any *.ex4-files could be potentially dangerous. Thank's FXcube

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi WilteredFire I have make a link to your examples at p.1, #1 "Trade Examples". Hope it's okay for you! Best wishes! FXcube

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hey FXcube, Sry, i do not have the .mq4 file. you can convert it into mq4 if you have a decompiler / converter. Please help in converting the indicator into an EA as it would be very profitable as the signals generated are more than 95% accurate. Regards, Shreyash

--- 帖子 #193 ---
FYI, the signal is plotted 3 bars back ... so your entries will be 3 bars too late. FerruFx

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Shreyash I don't have a decompiler due to the fact that most of these don't decompile exactly. The other topic is more a security question. Why download a *.ex4-file where you nothing knows about the code. When I would decompile it I have to put the *.ex4-file on my hardisc and it's exactly what I won't! (Excursus: No EA is 95% accurate and most of these EAs are bringing a loss and not a profit in life trading). Maybe you have make an excellent work! I don't know! I hope so! Best regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Dear Ferrufx, Do you mean to say it plots the signal at the third candle? If so, What kind of indicator is this? What strategy does it follow? Please add a sound alert to the indicator without changing its performance, so that i can test it. Whats your view on this indicator? Can it at least be used for scalping? Regards, Shreyash

--- 帖子 #196 ---
hi fxcube Ive been getting good results with your scalping strategy but i wanted to know what is a good money management risk ratio when your are scalping this way thanks.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi FC ! I am looking for a "catch me if you can " Trailing Stop EA To explain better: a "aggressive" TS in "fast" movements. the stop price is not using a fixed amount (5~15 pips TS ), but always at low (or high) of the last candle sets. The rule for the TP price after the open order (sell/buy) are secondary for me. Some mates of mine from Romania experiences on this. What I found out from them: is based more on price action &amp; THV4. Their rule is: Do not be afraid to lose 3 ~ 5 orders (max2~4 pips SL) until you catch the wave ! Of course they are not gamblers ,and are patient with the entry. P.S.-By the way, your article is very interesting. -I never thought it could be so ... "traumatic"..after ! Greetings for Zürich !

It's always a problem to "predict" turining points. so why not go for a more solid amount of EVIDENCE that a turning point is PAST, and then go with the new ESTABLISHED trend. DrDave

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Jackinthebox, On your picture you posted, I have to ask why were you trying to buy when it was a clear down trend? There was no evidence that the market was in an uptrend. If you were just guessing that maybe some consecutive bars with higher lows was a possible turning point, then I think you need some more practice and/or some different method for determining what direction you are going to try to trade. DrDave

Hi bfree! That's great! Thank's! FXcube

I don't know! It depends at my risk aversion as a function of the market environment. If I estimate excellent profit probabilities (e.g. the market is turning at an important pivotal point or the market price is running a full trend with a high volatility) I expect 0.025 - 0.2% Profit per trade. After every 5-10 scalping trades I make up a payoff about the Total. Hope it helps FXcube

EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 21 Entry Example - Confirmation Point The Frame below shows an Entry Point as a confirmation function of a Support Line after a Turning Point (here Point D) has built. You can further take a look at the CCI(14). Step 1: Draw a support Line (here A-B-C). Step 2: Wait at a Turning Point Step 3: Entry when the Support Line will be broken (here Point E). Step 4: Set a Stop Loss.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 21 Exit Example Step 5: Draw the Resistance Line (here G-H-I). Step 6: Exit when the Price cuts the Resistance (see Exit Area). You can additively take a look at the CCI. (Don't wait at any Grid-10 Levels).

Scalping Example for some Entry Long Rapid Trades &lt;simple &amp; efficient&gt; EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 22 The frame below has pointed out some probabilities of an Enter Long in a Market Environment of a Range Bound with the parameters of a &lt;Resistance Line&gt; and a &lt;CCI-Divergence&gt; independant of any Grid-Level. If a candle crosses or closes at the right side of a Resistance Line you could take a look at a CCI-Divergence. If so then the likelihood seems greater of making a scalping profit.

Example for an Entry Short Rapid Trade &lt;simple &amp; efficient&gt; EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 22 The frame below has pointed out some probabilities of an Enter Short in a Range Bound Market Environment with the parameters of a &lt;Support Line&gt; and a &lt;CCI-Divergence&gt; independant of any Grid-Level. The candle crosses the Support Line or closes at the right side of a Support Line. If so then the probability seems greater of making a scalping profit which becomes more powerful in close contact with a CCI-Divergence. After 2-5pips you can go out of the market or trail the Stop.

Dynamical Scalping It's one of my favored Trading Style, when Scalping at M1 near a Pivotal Point with a CCI-Divergence often you could go out at the next M1 Resistance Level with one or several orders. You could stay in the trade with the expectation of a run down when setting a Trailing Stop at the Break-Even Point or in the Winning Zone.

Hi Razorman Oh fine. Why not put your ideas on this thread here and tell all of us your Scalping Concept? A lot of traders use the RSI, others a combination of Stochastic, RSI, MACD,...A lot of interested traders are here to work out the best Place Areas for the "Fulfilled Box". The main problem seems to be where to set the "Fulfilled Box". I will make a link at all good ideas at p.1, #1 every time. That's clear!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hey i am a little confuse, just to clarify, the method of identifying the fulfilled box is divergence of the cci?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Travaillez, chacun en sa vocation. François Rabelais (Gargunta, chap. 45) See the summary of the discussion at p.1, # 1 Fulfilled Box Location . Some traders don't know where to find the right Entry Point, say where the "Fulfilled Box" have to set. Maybe CCI(14) could be a help for you by switching between M1 and M5, see Example, p.13, # 181 . Where to set a "Fulfilled Box" concerns the Topic about the Turning Points in the Market, for what is valid that everyone's opinion is bound to be subjective. The Examples below illustrate different concepts.

FOREX Scalping? WTF?! Jeder der sich ein bisschen in den FOREX Handel eingelesen hat, wird wahrscheinlich schon mal über den Begriff FOREX Scalping oder über eine Scalping Strategie oder Scalping Technik gestolpert sein. Die wenigsten können mit diesem Begriff wirklich etwas anfangen - dem wollen wir hier Abhilfe geben. Es geht also im folgenden nicht um die Beschreibung einer FOREX Scalping Strategie sondern lediglich um die Begriffsdefinition. Begriffsdefinition Scalping bedeutet "raus schneiden" oder auch "schälen", "raus schälen" etc. und genauso verhält sich auch ein so genannter Scalper , ein Forex-Trader der Scalping betreibt, am Markt: Er versucht aus einer gegebenen Marktbewegung (die nicht unbedingt nach oben oder unten gehen muss - manche Scalping Techniken funktionieren auch auf einem seitwärts gerichtetem Markt) einzelne kleine Bewegungen mitzunehmen und die gewonnen PIPS quasi aus dem Markt raus zu schälen. Dabei werden in einem sehr kleinen Zeitfenster Positionen eröffnet die nach ebenso kurzer Zeit wieder geschlossen werden. Der Gewinn (und bei erfolgreichen Scalpern auch der Verlust) schwankt in der Regel zwischen ein paar PIPS - bei manchen Techniken und manchen Marktsituationen vielleicht auch mal 10, 20 oder 30 PIPS. Aber das ist eher selten. FOREX Scalper beschränken sich im Normalfall auf einen einstelligen PIPS Gewinn - hauptsache positiv. Dies hat zur Folge, gerade auch, da man diese Handelstechnik nicht unbedingt den ganzen Tag über ausführen kann und will, dass die Positionsgröße bei Tradern, die FOREX Scalping betreiben, nicht selten hoch bis sehr hoch ist im Vergleich zu anderen, eher mittel- bis langfristigen Trading-Strategien. Dies können sich die meisten Trader dieser Techniken auch erlauben - denn Ihre Gewinnverhältnis ist in den meisten Fällen auch relativ hoch. Wobei allerdings dazu keine genauen Zahlen gegeben werden können, da diese sehr stark von Technik zu Technik schwanken. Genauso wie auch Aussagen bezogen auf die Zeitdauer eines einzelnen Handels recht schwierig zu treffen sind. In den meisten Fällen wird jede Technik, die zu einer Haltedauer von unter 5 Minuten pro Trade führt, schon als Scalping bezeichnet. Dies ist wichtig für den nächsten Punkt. Welchen Broker für das Scalping? Generell sollte man vielleicht zuerst eines klar stellen: Wenn Sie mal eine Position wieder nach 30 Sekunden schließen oder das vielleicht auch öfters machen, sollte das noch kein Problem für Ihren Broker darstellen. Sobald Sie aber ein System verwenden, mit dem Sie regelmäßig zeitlich sehr kurze Trades ausführen und dabei auch noch erfolgreich sind, hat Ihr Broker, wenn es sich um einen Market Maker , also einen Retail Broker , handelt, ein großes Problem: Er hat dann nämlich nicht mehr die Zeit, Ihre Position mit denen seiner anderen Kunden zu verrechnen und den Endbetrag bei seinem Liquiditätsprovider (also am Interbanken-Markt) zu hedgen (=durch eine gleichlautende Position abzusichern). Wenn Sie also gewinnen, muss der Broker in die Tasche greifen - was natürlich kein Broker gerne macht. Die Lösung dieses Problems Wenn Sie eine FOREX Scalping Technik einsetzen, dann sollten Sie vorher am besten bei Ihrem FOREX Broker nachfragen, ob dieser so ein Verhalten auch duldet. Es gibt sogar ein paar Retail Broker, die das Scalpen dulden, da diese Trader meistens in der Masse untergehen. Aber denken Sie immer daran: Je mehr Gewinn Sie durch Ihre FOREX Scalping Strategie machen, desto unbeliebter werden Sie bei Ihrem Broker! Sollten Sie noch kein Konto für diese Handelstechnik besitzen, so empfehlen wir, gleich bei einem ECN Broker ein Konto zu eröffnen. Durch das Durchreichen der Orders kann es dem Broker egal sein, wie Sie handeln. http://www.devisenhandel-forex.de/sc...ie-technik.htm

Forex Scalping - Extensive Guide on How to Scalp Forex Forex scalping is a popular method involving the quick opening and liquidation of positions. The term “quick” is imprecise, but it is generally meant to define a timeframe of about 3-5 minutes at most, while most scalpers will maintain their positions for as little as one minute. The popularity of scalping is born of its perceived safety as a trading style. Many traders argue that since scalpers maintain their positions for a brief time period in comparison to regular traders, market exposure of a scalper is much shorter than that of a trend follower, or even a day trader, and consequently, the risk of large losses resulting from strong market moves is smaller. Indeed, it is possible to claim that the typical scalper cares only about the bid-ask spread, while concepts like trend, or range are not very significant to him. Although scalpers need ignore these market phenomena, they are under no obligation to trade them, because they concern themselves only with the brief periods of volatility created by them. Forex scalping is not a suitable strategy for every type of trader . The returns generated in each position opened by the scalper is usually small; but great profits are made as gains from each closed small position are combined. Scalpers do not like to take large risks, which means that they are willing to forgo great profit opportunities in return for the safety of small, but frequent gains. Consequently, the scalper needs to be a patient, diligent individual who is willing to wait as the fruits of his labors translate to great profits over time. An impulsive, excited character who seeks instant gratification and aims to “make it big” with each consecutive trade is unlikely to achieve anything but frustration while using this strategy. Scalping also demands a lot more attention from the trader in comparison to other styles such as swing-trading, or trend following. A typical scalper will open and close tens, and in some cases, more than a hundred positions in an ordinary trading day, and since none of the positions can be allowed to suffer great losses (so that we can protect the bottom line), the scalper cannot afford to be careful about some, and negligent about some of his positions. It may appear to be a formidable task at first sight, but scalping can be an involving, even fun trading style once the trader is comfortable with his practices and habits. Still, it is clear that attentiveness and strong concentration skills are necessary for the successful forex scalper. One does not need to be born equipped with such talents, but practice and commitment to achieve them are indispensable if a trader has any serious intention of becoming a real scalper. Scalping can be demanding, and time-consuming for those who are not full-time traders. Many of us pursue trading merely as an additional income source, and would not like to dedicate five six hours every day to the practice. In order to deal with this problem, automated trading systems have been developed, and they are being sold with rather incredible claims all over the web. We do not advise our readers to waste their time trying to make such strategies work for them; at best you will lose some money while having some lessons about not trusting anyone’s word so easily. However, if you design your own automated systems for trading (with some guidance from seasoned experts and self-education through practice) it may be that you shorten the time which must be dedicated to trading while still being able to use scalping techniques. And an automated forex scalping technique does not need to be fully automatic; you may hand over the routine and systematic tasks such as stop-loss and take-profit orders to the automated system, while assuming the analytical side of the task yourself. This approach, to be sure, is not for everyone, but it is certainly a worthy option. Finally, scalpers should always keep the importance of consistency in trade sizes while using their favored method. Using erratic trade sizes while scalping is the safest way to ensure that you will have a wiped-out forex account in no time, unless you stop practicing scalping before the inevitable end. . Scalping is based on the principle that profitable trades will cover the losses of failing ones in due time, but if you pick position sizes randomly, the rules of probability dictate that sooner or later an oversized, leveraged loss will crash all the hard work of a whole day, if not longer. Thus, the scalper must make sure that he pursues a predefined strategy with attention, patience and consistent trade sizes. This is just the beginning, of course, but without a good beginning we would diminish our odds of success, or at least reduce our profit potential. Now let’s take a look at the contents of this article where forex scalping is discussed with all its details, advantages and disadvantages. Our suggestion is that you peruse all of this article and absorb all the information that can benefit you. But if you think that you’re already familiar with some of the material, to shorten your route, we present the table of contents of this article. Contents 1. How scalpers make money : Here we will take a look at the logic behind scalping, and we’ll discuss the best conditions and necessary adjustments which must be made by a scalper for profitable trading. 2. Choosing the right broker for scalping : Not every broker is accommodative to scalping. Sometimes this is the stated policy of the firm, at other times the broker creates the conditions which make successful scalping impossible. It is important that the novice scalper know what to look for in the broker before opening his account, and here we’ll try to enlighten you on these important points. 3. Best currencies for Scalping : There are currency pairs where scalping is easy and lucrative, and there are others where we advise strongly against the use of this strategy. In this part we’ll discuss this important subject in detail and give you usable hints for your trades. 4. Best times for Scalping : There is an ongoing debate about the best times for successful scalping in the forex market . We’ll present the various opinions, and then offer our own conclusion. 5. Strategies in Scalping : Strategies in scalping need not differ substantially from other short-term methods. On the other hand, there are particular price patterns and configurations where scalping is more profitable. We’ll examine and study them in depth in this section. a. Range Scalping: Some traders consider ranging markets better suited for scalping strategies. Here we’ll examine why, and how to scalp under such conditions. b. Breakout Scalping: We’ll examine news breakouts, and technical breakouts separately and discuss suitable scalping strategies for both. c. Trend Scalping: Here we’ll take a general look at forex scalping in trending markets. 6. Trend Following while Scalping : Trends are volatile, and many scalpers choose to trade them like a trend follower, while minimizing the trade lifetime in order to control market risk. In this part we’ll examine the usage of Fibonacci extension levels for scalping trends. 7. Disadvantages and Criticism of Scalping : Scalping is not for everyone, and even seasoned scalpers and those committed to the style would do well to keep in mind some of the dangers and disadvantages involved in using the style blindly. 8. Conclusions : In this final section we’ll combine the lessons and discussions of the previous chapters, and reach at conclusions about who should use the forex scalping trading style, and the best conditions under which it can be utilized.

Calculated from the Day Besides all the Swing Trades I like to scalp 10 times a Day with higher Lotsizes 3 x 1 Lot (Option B) per Entry (with a 50K Account). If you trade 5/10 x 4 Pips a Day you have made 20/40 Pips,... x 3 Orders = 60/120 Pips Minimum, ...say 600.-$/1'200.-$ a Day. Often the second and the third order will make more Profit than the first one because they could run longer in the market with a Trailing Stop. Now you have only to subtract the Minus Trades and the Spread, ...but 20/40 pips a Day seems a Regulatory Net Profit at Advanced Trading Level.

I like to trade every Strategy in my own way, so also the Box Scalping. Dynamical Scalping means also not to hold onto the hard Rules of Box Scalping and wait if the Market Price is really crossing a Grid Line. You can do it, ...sure!,..., but it isn't a must. If you like to trade more in a flow, you could more let the market it's breath. Why not go out and in and out and in with several orders at the same time and diversify the Exits in Pip Sizes and in the Timing?. Box Scalping could give you an excellent frame(work) and an orientation.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi forexcube, i've read half of this thread. i think it's actually quite hard for beginner to make profit in the long run, but nevertheless it's very good way for trader to learn the market because the price action is boxed and is easier to conclude (and actually it's still a pure-and-naked chart). But hey, i think it's quite fun to trade with this method for how long have you used this method?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi alvseek! Thank you for your feedback! Okay So I have to work out more a "Locating Strategy" which could give optical signals for setting the Fulfilled Boxes, maybe based on Indicators like the CCI and the Pivotals. Maybe I'll put the "Fulfilled Box" into the "Sicko-Scalp-Machine" (without MACD) in the hope of creating a more "Practical Design" which should be easier to apply at the Forex Market. Sicko-Scalp-Machine: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=281532 . I use "Box Scalping" since 3 years and with the CCI(14) Indicator (Tops &amp; Bottom Trading) over 5-7 years. Often the "Box" is only in my head (to imagine), ...to draw it at the charts needs often too much time. That's also the reaon why it wasn't drawn in the last "Life Trading Charts" here. Kindest regards! Best wishes to Indonesia! FXcube

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I'm not sure if including more indicators could get more practical. This box method is already perfect for me. I think it's very simple but still very sharp (and giving a very good result in demo account for the last 3 hours). But that's maybe because i've (and of course you too and other not-beginner traders) familiar with the PA. I think it would be more practical if there is given specific, whether it's rule or condition (in the price action) when not to trade and when to trade with this method. as for my self, i just trade when there's appear to be a quite distinguish-able trend. fyi, i've tried backtesting and it appears that it could catch near-top and near-bottom price, nice *off topic, have you ever went to Indonesia fxcube?

I agree that this is a bit difficult for newbies that have no idea about "basic" ideas such as support/resistance, trendlines, momentum, etc. Forexcube, After seeing your examples with CCI divergence, that looks like a very good strategy to use for high probablility entries. On my latest trade post, I trailed a stop behind the highs on the last bar that made a lower low. I will also will be looking at drawing a pseudo-tendline and just use a candle that CLOSES across this line to exit. I think that would offer 2 benefits over the trailing stop: 1) will make the exit closer to a swing point; 2) is more in the spirit of "scalping", where you get in and out rather quickly. If the reverse move turns out to be just a retracement, can always jump back in for another scalp (if there is a valid setup.) DrDave

# 251 # 252 # 255 I think the hardest problem is to get accommodating with one system or another. best solutions you will never find. until you test yourself...add, delete, modify indi.. Curious as: box relaxes me .... ! stressles &amp; relaxing I do not care if I lose 2 ~ 3 orders (before I was desperate when it happens to me) no kiding... when i have too many indicators on monitor,become more concentrated, but nervous. I do not need this.....I have enough stress at work I work in four shifts , when I get home is noise,I am tired,but happy. ...house is full of life and is increasingly getting better. last five weeks was a nightmare. It was quiet at night to learn about forex and for testing.. im still a beginner... I try to keep a log of what i make (demo &amp; real ) in FF (bfree profile) ForexCube, you are a source of ...."quiet" with your charts (for me at least ) Thank you.

Hi alvseek Good question! I like to trade all my scalping trades manually. Script, Indi, EA could be okay but the most of the time they makes problems or the broker makes someones. Maybe you could upload your script, indi or EA here at board and we all here could help you to rewrite it. (E.g. It should have be functions for a 4 and 5 digit broker,... and so on).

Trade Example Box Scalping Option B (3 x 1 Entry Orders, see # 5 )* EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 24 Entry Short @ 1.4465 (e.g. see # 314 ). *...by setting a Trailing Stop and going out with the last (3rd Order) at the next Pivotal Point (DPV 1.4431). By trading with a 100'000.-$ Account you could trade with (A) 1 x 1.0 Lot or (B) 3 x 1.0 Lots per Entry. By trading with a 10'000.-$ Account you could trade with (A) 1 x 0.1 Lot or (B) 3 x 0.1 Lots per Entry. or with a 1'000.-$ Account (A) 1 x 0.01 Lot / (B) 3 x 0.01 Lots.

In Retrospect It's not vitally important if some Scalping Orders aren't closen (here 2 open orders # 333 /1.4435, # 334 /1.4454 just now) when the higher Timeframes (H4 &amp; Daily) are signalizing a Bearish Divergence. What you can make is to let these few Scalping Orders running into a Swinging Trade (higer Timeframe-Level) and expect more Profit by running these ones more longer term (H1/H4) with a higher Pip Target (see # 348 , # 349 ). Here in Switzerland you have also the option to hedge these Sell Positions (with Buy Orders and minimize the risk).

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Forexcube, first of all let me say thank you very much for your posts. I really appreciate each of your educational posts here on FF. Most of your posts are little gems that should be observed carefully. I'm very interested in the approach you use to trade M1/M5 (scalping trades). Simple and very effective. Your skillful use of PA, S/R, Pivot Points and CCI indicator is a beautifull piece of art. Only a master like you can do that. I only have a few moments a day to trade and read posts at FF... (I have full time job) so I need to learn as much as possible how to walk across your path. Could I ask you why the CCI indi has 140 and -120 levels in your charts and how to use it? Would you mind sharing your Pivot Point indicator? Have a good day and Happy Pippin! Alejandro

Hi Alejandro Merçi: Thank you for the kind words. I really appreciate it! CCI: The CCI-Levels aren't a hard rule. I change the levels in fact from time to time. For me they are a help when I scalp at M1. The Market Price turns around (up or down) and I consider if I would go in with some more entries when the CCI will cross these lines. If vola is high often I go in the market further more orders. Maybe you could change these levels more in this way where you feel fine! Indicator: The Pivotal Indicator has tacked at the attachment. Good Luck! Photo Scene: Nature is great! Kindest regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #407 ---
First off, Thank you for posting this thread Forexcube. I've been playing with your methods this past week with limited success. I was going to throw out the idea that this might be used at a higher TF, say, 15m with 20pip grids? Doesn't really make it a scalping system anymore, but would help folks that aren't as quick with recognizing the patterns.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
EURUSD, M15, 2011 August 29 Maybe something like this. 1st Entry with Candlestick Patterns and/or Pivotals and the 2nd Entry when the Market Price crosses an EMA Line (e.g. EMA55, or 100, or EMA200 or so) or have closen at the other side. You could also draw some Trendlines and set the Market Entry at these Crossover Points. At this example below you could also switch from M15 at the "Shooting Star"-Situation at M1-Timeframe and trade also here the Shorts. An other M15 Strategy could be with EMA5,20,100 &amp; MACD 5,26,9. Sell only when EMA20 is under EMA100. Target: 5-10 Pips M5: You could also try EURUSD, M5 by taking the Entries with the help of EMA5 to the Close and EMA5 to the Open, MACD 12,26,1 and Stochastic 5,3,3 by a Risk ~1% and a Stop Loss from the High/Low from the previous Candle, but Minimum 20 Pips. See also Advanced Candlestick Patterns. http://www.investopedia.com/articles...#axzz1WMeguYAo Good Luck! FXcube

hope so...in the long run...we're slow:-(

The old version now.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
there's a conflict here...when you compile..bacause you have OCO 3 times in your expert folder. It shows only 1 in mine http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1314820390

--- 帖子 #451 ---
keep only "OCO Visual_2 " in your expert Advisors folder. remove the 3 other OCO Why are they here? You can have only 1 and run only 1 EA per account. You need to open a second account if you have another EA running. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1314821171

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Can I ask you why do you have a date of august 31 here? Did you rename the EA? anyways only 1 OCO should be in your expert advisor folder. Let me know if it works now please http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...3&amp;d=1314820390

Maybe it needs more time for a problem solution. I don't know! Actual with the first original EA:

Hey here you are... You need to check allow DLL imports Advisor folder is good now . http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...5&amp;d=1314826041

--- 帖子 #459 ---
If so, maybe you have win a sensitive one! Thank you for your great help. Experience Report I don't have use any EA for a long time. And each time it's the same bullsh*t! EA's don't work at other computers with other brokers and so on and every time I hear the traders say "oh it's a really great EA. You could make much profit" ...and so on. I don't think so. I have only lost my time since now and nothing goes once more.... Anyway! Best regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #460 ---
It should work now. Be sure if you already attached another EA (OCO or other) to a chart to remove it also directly from the chart. 1 Right click on the chart.... 2 Second tab expert advisor 3 Click remove Always restart MT4 From now ...the way it shows on your pic OCO will work on its own..No need to do anything anymore. Even if you reboot your PC ..OCO will still keep working untill you stop it directly from the chart.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
You're right..I tried many also and they are BS...but this one works good...no bugs..no CPU problem....proof it opened already a pending order on your EU chart.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Have change the Demo Broker to FXDD just now. Here it goes. But where is the difference between these two brokers with the exception of the higher spread at FXDD, where more pips will be lost when running the EA?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
OK just try it a week then let me know. What I think about robots ..some do work really good ..but the scam is that the ones who sell them never tell you that you need to have a certain level of experience to use them. They will never replace the trader. They are very sophisticated and need to be monitored very closely.. To make it short..you can never get rich with a robot or any EAs in general if you're not a good trader in the first place.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
You're welcome

May I ask you what kind of settings you use on EU M5 ? FerruFx

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Maybe I rewrite the OCO-EA if I have more time. It couldn't be that this EA set a Buy Stop 1.4435 and a Sell Stop 1.40754 at EURUSD when the Daily Range is 1.40 - 1.45. What a sh*t! Kindest regards FXcube

EU H1 EU M1 Scalping for 10 pips ..trailing 8-10

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Thanks. You don't use StopLoss. So how do you manage hedging ? I mean, when the price turn against you and go to trigger the opposite pendings, the previous orders are still here. Do you close them or your broker allow hedging ? Do you reset the EA after orders closed ? Because when price goes far from the trigger lines, you are in a situation where no more order will open until price goes back ... if price goes back ! FerruFx

Hi FXCube ! I have congratulated you before for a system that makes money! I find your methods good - can make money systematically. I myself trade similar system - don't post because of all sorts of guys who would like to "improve" upon the posts in general. I could not understand this part of FF-posters. Why are people obsessed with " I will suggest something that will make you a better trader or make your system better" ? As far as EAs go, if they were such money-spinners, why would the vendors sell it for $99 a shot ! And why everyone is not a millionaire if EAs work. Funny they all use it on Demos. I think this is the hardest game bar none, in town but money can be made by following simple methods and utilizing intelligent MM.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi Matt795 Scalping is for me 10 Sec., 30 Sec. M1, M2, M5 not more. If you have the intention to avoid false signals look at higher timeframes and don't scalp (or e.g. you can use ADX at M5 &gt; 20/25 to avoid false signals. Trade then above this level, or/and use e.g.MACD12,26,9). So easy! If you scalp the whole day long you will forfeit your money! Take also a look at # 478 , please. Kindest regards FXcube

I consider all Traders to be friends and so offer my Best advice - I hope you do not mind. If you are trading, Do NOT treat anything connected with Forex as Toy - it can blow-out a couple of years of savings before you know it. Again, excuse my Op - work hard at it to make money - no easy way out ! Best Regards.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
hi forex cube question is why did you get out the trade when the CCI hit 0

--- 帖子 #486 ---
See # 485 Hi 408gls I didn't look at CCI hit Zero. When you click with the left mouse button on the chart it will get larger and you coud see the right value. In this case the CCI was below -120 (M1 Level) and the Market seems more to have had a low Volatility and 7 Pips were enough for me. At first I take a look at the Market Environments (Volatility, Range Bound or more a Trend, and so on) and then I decide to get out earlier of the market (after 2-10 Pips) or let some of the orders more run into the win. When I think that the Market could change e.g. at a Pivotal Point and could have develop the power for a M5 trend I tend more to go in the market with three orders or more and let the last one(s) run in the "heaven" (maybe 20-50 Pips) with a Trailing Stop. Life Trading take this into account. But at first of all I W A I T for market entries with higher probablities of success and the CCI-Indicator could give good signals with -120/+140 at M1 and so look at the CCI-Tops and Bottoms at M5, also. You could also take a look at CCI-H1-Top, then switch down and wait at the CCI-M30-Top, the next chance could be CCI-M15-Top, afterwards at a CCI-M5 and M1-Top and trade at all these levels short - et vice versa. In the last case you would have had another risk-reward-ratio, ...why not? Kindest regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #487 ---
ok thanks i think i got it you said you do multiple orders with the same currency at different levels ?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Yes! ...and so... first of all it's more a kind of Time- &amp; Money Management and the Strategy by any standards should be more subordinate (it's not that important!). FXcube

--- 帖子 #489 ---
You can make with a subprime strategy more money when you have an excellent Money- &amp; Riskmanagement as you can give up the ghost a superb strategy with a fake M&amp;R.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Across all the markets I've traded that is the honest truth. The sooner novices learn that the better off they are. There's only 3 signals a trading system produces: buy, sell, no trade It's what you do with that signal that matters and where experience comes into play. I've been trading lately using Oanda 's mobile app lately and since it doesn't have any indicators I can't use things like the CCI. Instead what I look for are price pivots (a low, a lower low, a higher low. Looks like a triangle) and have been very successful. I hope you don't mind forexcube that I'm pimping another thread, but Chantalb's "Trading Price Pivots" has an excellent explaination of it. Over there they trade higher timeframes, but a pivot has to start at lower timeframes...

Hi, I feel like a real novice with my inquiry...I have read the thread but it escapes me what constitutes a "Fulfilled Box". Can someone please provide a definition? My apologies if this has been answered earlier. Thanks, BC2

--- 帖子 #496 ---
There is no definite answer to this question. When plotting a Fulfilled Box you don't want the reflexes of the Market. You only want to plot its intentional movements. Often you can set a "Fulfilled Box" e.g. at a EURUSD-M15/M30 Resistance or Support Line and trade it at M1/M5, see also the hint at p.1, #1, "Fulfilled Box Location" (read also the advice of DrDave, # 199 ). Be careful in setting a "Fulfilled Box". At those times it seemed like the market was "breaking". In hindsight we can see that the market was merely testing that level. FXcube

Hi Skovjuul See p.1, #1, please. Fulfilled Box Location Discussion: Some traders don't know where to find the right Entry Point, say where the "Fulfilled Box" have to set. Maybe CCI(14) could be a help for you by switching between M1 and M5, see Example, p.13, # 181 . "DrDave" have make excellent Inputs (see also the Link of his Examples below, please). Where to set a "Fulfilled Box" concerns the Topic about the Turning Points in the Market, for what is valid that everyone's opinion is bound to be subjective. The Examples below illustrate different concepts. Examples: p.6, # 85 ; p.8, # 106 ; p.8, # 118 ; EURUSD, M5, 2011 August 19, CCI &amp; Pivotals, p.13, # 189 ; &gt;An excellent concept from "DrDave", p.14, # 199 ; EURUSD, M5, 2011 August 21, Entry Point with a Support Line, p.14, # 204 ; EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 22, Example for some Entry Long Rapid Trades, p.14, # 207 ; EURUSD, M1, 2011 August 22, Example for an Entry Short Rapid Trade (2-5 pips), p.14, # 208 ; &gt;"DrDave", EU-M5-Sell, p.18, # 257 , see also the PDF attachment for logic of short, p.18, # 257 ; Take Notice, # 496 ; Do you wish that I should publish a "Fulfilled-Box-Concept" solely based on the CCI?

When I estimate a market situation with a higher probability of a win I go in with more lot sizes and a little more when I have made and excellent profit the days before; so I use also a higher lotsizes by scalping (e.g. between 1-10 Lots only for several minutes). I never publish real accounts! Kindest regards FXcube

Hello Forexcube, Maybe you have explained already. But could you tell me how do you use CCI in your strategy for scalping. I understand the divergence bit, but most of the charts you posted I can't figure out why you exited at such and such level of CCI. thanks

Hi tigerbalm The Commodity Channel Index is for me a help and will give me an orientation which I haven't to follow. I can but it isn't a must. So I take a look moreover at the market environments at M1 &amp; M5 (HH, HL, LH, LL, the Pivotals, the volatility &amp; the momentum...). When I trade after London Close (now) I look at the CCI more strictly. If there is a M5 Divergence and a CCI Top or Bottom I expect a greater Profit Chance generally. After London Close Volatility seems often not so strong, so the scalping trades needs more time for catching several pips in slow motion.

ForexCube you're trading breakouts rather than fading overbought/oversold ?!! Sometime i use this tpl for confirmation (all indis are in MT4)

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Interesting Topic, bfree! Maybe that at M1/M5 it should be more in this way you've described. At higher timeframes (H4 and near the Pivotals) Forex Pure Fade Trades seems market-dominating. I didn't make any statistics about that. FXcube

Example to make a trade in this way, then... The Bulls and the Bears Indicator don't give me more information when I see it directly at the green and red bars, ...maybe moreover it could confuses me more.

It's absolutely indifferent if I trade the ups or the downs. Economical informations about Europe (Fundamental Data) affected me to trade more the downs. Godspeed! Fxcube

Random Thoughts on Patience Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold. For if you put on more clothes as the cold increases, it will have no power to hurt you. So, in like manner, you must grow in patience when you meet with great wrongs, and they will then be powerless to vex your mind. Leonardo da Vinci

I like this one. The keys to patience are acceptance and faith. Accept things as they are, and look realistically at the world around you. Have faith in yourself and in the direction you have chosen. Ralph Marston

Random Thoughts on Patience Learn the art of patience. Apply discipline to your thoughts when they become anxious over the outcome of a goal. Impatience breeds anxiety, fear, discouragement and failure. Patience creates confidence, decisiveness, and a rational outlook, which eventually leads to success. Brian Adams

EURUSD, H1, 2011 September 08 Triangle patterns are usually characteristic of a trend consolidation followed by an accelerated break out of the pattern in the direction of the continuing trend. Symmetrical Triangle http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...riangle-78.gif http://www.cmsfx.com/resources/graph...angle-78-2.gif A symmetrical triangle is indicative of a period of consolidation during an uptrend or a downtrend. The symmetrical triangle has a line of support that slopes upwards and a line of resistance that slopes downward. The triangle pattern yields to a breakout in the direction that corresponds with the trend beforehand, though not always. http://www.cmsfx.com/en/forex-educat...angles-wedges/ If so then the price could make a breakout downside, but when you expect the daily range (rough values between 1.40 - 1.45) it could go just as well upwards.
