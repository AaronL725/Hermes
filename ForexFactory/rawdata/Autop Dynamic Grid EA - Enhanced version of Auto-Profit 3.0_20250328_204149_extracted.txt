Hi everyone. I've been following all the Threads around grid martingales lately (Remon Accumulative Grid, Bauta's Expanding Grid, Keydcuk Piggy..) and tried to draw the best of each. I've been working on some Grid enhancement these months, SWB Grid, Viper grid, and the good old Ilan/Auto-Profit/GridMeUp strategies. Here is a dynamic TP/Pipstep version of Auto-Profit 3.0 that I had translated from russian and recoded from scratch. I use an hybrid formula based on HiLo / ATR / raw pips (in % of the price) to determine my targets. This EA will always be free and I do not intend to sell anything. __________________________________________________ Disclaimer : Autop is an EA meant to trade ranging pairs mean reversion by scaling-in as the price moves against its TP, meaning exponentially exposing the account to the underlying asset. Autop's money management being exponent-based, it makes the EA able to recover fast from its drawdowns but can stress your account equity considerably. Trading any scale-in strategy is dangerous and one often risks his entire account for doing so. I am not responsible for what you guys will do with this EA and advise you to ask for settings check-up before running it live ! New release : version 5.3 Now available: - Trend filter (ADX / ADXMA based) - Days of the Week filter - Spread filter - Time filter (hh:mm starts / hh:mm ends) - ability to move the InfoBox (hud) from top right to top left - Survival mode - ADX Trend Hedge : hedge your current position when the filter switches On . This position will close as your current cycle closes. - hedge over time filter (i.e. you can just hedge your trades as the time filter is on without having to close them in loss.) - sharp entries option : the trades are confirmed by the ADX - one-sided trend filter : allow the expert to take trades toward the momentum in trend - Disable Short Cycles (disabling short cycles will still allow the EA to open short hedges on long cycles) - Disable Long Cycles (disabling Long cycles will still allow the EA to open long hedges on short cycles) Trading Idea: Opportunity mode By running 2 instances of the EA on 2 charts of the same pair, one with Long Cycles disabled, the other with Short Cycles disabled, and using the one-sided trend filter on both , we will make sure that the EA makes money of big moves whatever the direction even if the other gets stuck into a cycle. Edit: Make sure to change the Magic Numbers of the EA on the 2 charts so that they don't interfere with each-other Thank you for helping on this development bros, Edo Last updated on the 22/07/2016

4.2 version now available Post #1

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi Edorenta, great work! This is the BT (one month: 2016.6.1 - 2016.7.1). It's possibile to have the source code for implementation?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I still need to work on it.. I don't plan on selling anything but I'd like to see how keen you guys are before I share my code What implementation would you consider?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
You're right, I respect your work and it is right that you finish the project according to your goals. I saw you expected, between inputs, even a Stop safeguard Equity. I also would expect a Target of the day and possibly a Trailing on Equity, for portfolio too (later, advanced). I have implemented something like that as an external EA, but perhaps I should put it inside a native EA. The martingale / grid are very dangerous and must be handled very carefully controlled, putting constraints et similia.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I know 25% BT is not a good result for referencing but I may use it with my VPS and here is my set file. May I know what is the different between 4.0v and 4.2v? Thanks~

--- 帖子 #9 ---
thanks mate. which time frame and pair is best for this nice ea?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
4.2 fixes a bug related to the Pair Digits (Takeprofits calculation was incorrect on 3 digits pairs such as XXXJPY)

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Short TF such as M1 / M5 should be favored. Pairs that retrace such as EURUSD / USDCAD / EURCHF theoretically would give better results.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thanks bro when you say: "Pairs that retrace " - do you mean ranging pairs?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Congratulations on the good combination thinking Edo! I wish I could spare you some time, you would eventually waste in the wrong direction. Here is what I have come up to, after 30 months of strategies development, live trading, live accounts blown ups and almost unlimited number of demo accounts being also blown away. I hope it will be helpful to your efforts. 1. There is no bad strategy. Almost any strategy works. Except the pure martingale based ones, those who double, triple or quadruple, whatever. Multipliers are OK. 2. Humans are constantly changing their trading plans, usually after a loss. This is from where a bad name is given to multiple otherwise good strategies. 3. Whatever strategy one is using, never change it. Stick to it. When the bad times are over, good will come back again. 4. If 3 is strictly followed, it is likely, when there is a proper general profit/loss management, one to stay profitable. 5. All grid systems are beaten by the market. At least twice per year. By beaten, I mean total account annihilation. 6. Knowing 5, one should trade, one and only, with a fixed amount of money. 10k for example. 7. All accumulated profits should be immediately withdrawn or moved to another account, where the ongoing trading cannot not hurt them. 8. Never, under any circumstances, grew the base 10k account into a bigger one. If you do it, you are doomed. It is impossible to make money, if you grow the trading account. 9. Losing the base 10k account few times a year is OK. As with any other business, it is just an expense one has to face while trading. 10. Trust your system and never betray it. Once you betray it, look for a new job, cause you will lose your capital anyway. 11. Trading grids is a sign of greed. Being all over the place has never being a good idea. However, nice money still can be made, although the rates moves in chaos-like design, made only to kill all grids, while it looks like it is favoring them. 12. Range is the best grid killer. Try to detect it. The sooner, the better. 13. Find a range-based strategy. You will need it, even when you trade the trend-based grids. 14. Try to avoid multipliers or adding an additional baskets/virtual ea to a level. If you do that, you will still make nice profits at trend times and will register small losses in range times. I am sorry if I sound too parental or even mystic. Please, do not get me wrong. I just want to be in help of the community here and all traders that are struggling. Very soon I will post my live TE. Where I will trade only for pure fun...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
is this a commercial content??

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The answer is on this page... not too far up. Thanks edo, I'll check it out sometime.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thx for sharing your work and Ea Edoranta. And thx to MoneyZilla for extremely valueable input. Been in the market for 20yrs, and can vouch for his rules... Still can't help looking for value in grids....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
remon is selling his system even if the thread is not in commercial content

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi, I have backtest the EA using default setting with $500 starting equity from Jan4, 2016-Jul1,2016. Below is the result I got.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Edo l am testing it on demo account since 12 hours from now first 8 hours EU only last 4 hours EU and UC So far 96.6 P and really little DD... Excellent job mate...Congrats... Hope that will continue... Blew up 1 account with remon's one... Maybie entries are better... Keep you posted

--- 帖子 #20 ---
This will blow up account either without the equity StopLoss, Grid is not a safe strategy for any period especially news. So I would like to trade it in Asian period to reduce the potential risk.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Edorenta! i'm checking it on demo acc. for the EU and EC so far with a very little DD. Thnx for sharing. Hope u'll release the real account version. Really appreciate your work and effort. Subsribed Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #22 ---
You're free to manually stop the ea during news. I'll work on a news filter This is a real account version but I encourage you to run further testing before running this live. I really appreciate your insight Zilla, as always you're a man of wise words. I'm actually trying to split with the grid model, rather using similar order management but working on a sharp entry and trend following. Idealy the ea would trade grid-style in ranging markets, and trade longer in trend. Kind of cyclical trading. Once more thanks for the warning, I wouldn't waste time on such extended dev if I was not interested in it

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Edorenta Thank you so much for your great work and sharing. Can you add a item in EA? such as at some time of week end, to close all orders if net profit of opened order + today closed orders &gt;0. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Great post! Can you please explain your thinking behind point 6,7 &amp; 8? Regards Vlad

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Here have one more request, may you implement the EA with a time filter? hope for your great update~

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello Edorenta, thanks for your EA and your contribution to the FF community. I'be been back and forward testing it with success, and I like the way that you have concepted this EA, just want to bring up a suggestion, if you have time, and think it's worthy, to add or to create a hedge version of this EA. I think this idea will reduce the DD and increase profitability cause while we are opening positions against the trend and wait for the retracement like it's working now, we also could make money in favor of the trend. Please think about it. Thanks and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
MoneyZilla, If you have the time, could you please expound on the above statement? Is it because of broker tricks that you say this? Or, some other reason(s)? Thanks! knickalls EDIT: Looks like you may have answered this in the "Mathematical Trading System" thread.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Yes, I did. The answer is here . Unfortunately, they disregard the data I gave them. I think they are unlucky. Those, who read my explanation and try to understand the data I have posted there, in ranging times will be able to reach rate predictions with over 90% of success. 30-60-90 pips is easy to catch. When I say easy, I really mean it. P.S. I personally do hate trend, cause it is pip size is unpredictable, while in range everything is predictable, clean and easy.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Edorenta, Nice EA, I have some questions on it. 1. The equity is protected by 15% loss. Several huge drop in the back test as show. As the equity increase, the actual amount will be increase as based on 15%. Is it possible to have fixed equity loss in the EA? So that we don't have to withdraw the profit immediately and we can do the backrest to see how the improvement of this EA is. 2. I tried to reduce the lot multiplier from 1.8, all lots are 0.01 without increments, I think more safe to do it, in the BT, the equity grow steadily but slowly, how to reduce it? I hope to find the balance point. 3. In my forward test, when the equity loss % reached, not all the opened positions closed at the same time, only one or some closed. Is it correct? And, soon after those cut loss, the price rebounds, a new position open again, that is OK?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Bigape, Will you be able to share your setting? Is this using AP4.2 ? Regards Laikos

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Laikos, sure ... but the BT is on 4.0 version

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Edo So far results are just....Amazing... Do you plan to use it live any soon? What do you suggest as a minimum to do so...? Just speculating... On my demo .19 Lot was the max DD reached so far... Picking by example a low margin currency: 30$ margin/.01 lot= it means approx 600$ margin for one trade not including others involved... What do you think? l am curious to know your thought as you probably have a plan to use it live sooner or later... Thanks for your contribution to Forex traders Regards

--- 帖子 #33 ---
[quote=Edorenta;9019970]This is a real account version but I encourage you to run further testing before running this live. {quote} Hi Edorenta! What will be the minimum amount needed if i want to trade it live for just one pair say Usd/Cad. thnx for ur sharing and response Regards,

--- 帖子 #34 ---
On a cent account, $250 would be a safe basis. On a micro I'd say that anything under $2000 is lead to get margin called in the medium term using the EA as it is currently. However I ran a test on a micro with $600 a few years back with a similar strategy and was able to triple my account in a few weeks before it got whipped out. As Zilla said, it's all a matter of withdrawing at the right time when trading risky style It will depend on the way you want to trade it (i.e very small pipstep and high multiplicator in order to recover quickly, or rather high step and multiplicator between 1.4 and 1.7 trying to lower the exposure. I don't have this much time atm but stay tuned, here are all the implementations I'll bring to it: -News Filter using the FFcal so you don't have to worry about the news/break whipsaw -Trend filter to exit counter-trend hedge (I'll use an ADX) -Time / Days filter so you can set it the way you want Let me some time to figure these out. If any coder is keen on working along, pm me I let Autop run at work last friday for a 7 hour session, here are the results:

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hello Edo, may you add time filter on the EA please? because I would like to move it on a real account but asian period only. Hope for your upgrade implementation~

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hello Edo,... Good day,... I think you need to add in "Commission/Lot" value as consideration also,... because in the long run,.. PayOff/trade become smaller and smaller,.. eaten by COMMISSION/Lot,... If you add in as the component of TP,.. then will be help,... Thanks, Budi

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yeah, the important thing, commission......

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Good work Edorenta

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello Edorenta, well done, this is one of the toughest martingale gird system I can found in this forum....so far. first thing first.........could you pls. move the dialog screen to the left? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Nice suggestion Jonirrenicus, i've tried to use the filters in the EA settings to disable the EA name or the panel, but it doesn't work (Don't know if it's my terminal problem). Besides my hedge version suggestion, I've also think when you have time Edorenta to add a survive function, that will allows in strong trending periods to close positions that goes against in zero or minimum profit. Thanks and good work.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks Edorenta, EA seems have very promising, tcurrently esting it. I did following -..table and analytic to false

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Ok, just checked what is the issue, it works if you change the settings before attach to chart, after it's on the chart, if you change the setting it will not apply. It happens the same for all the others settings. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #43 ---
New version released: 4.3 Now available: - News filter (to be tested) - Trend filter (ADX / ADXMA based) - Time filter (hh:mm starts / hh:mm ends) - ability to move the InfoBox (hud) from top right to top left Much more to come. ​ Version is updated on post 1 but you can find it here as well with the indicators it lays on.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I'm sorry I'm not planning on working on a copy cat of Remon78eg EA (RHunt) as I think there is much more interesting to be digged. Hence I don't think I will work on a hedging version anytime soon. I corrected this, the EA now cleans up the chart at every init/deinit

--- 帖子 #45 ---
ok guys what are the best settings for this EA

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks Edorenta. Another thing, may you suggest some scalping settings? With shorter take profit and shorter steps? What can we change to achieve this, even it's means it's more dangerous. Thanks...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Lower the HiLo/ATR weight to less than 0.25 each (i.e. 0.16 each) with raw pip offset &gt; your spread (i.e. 2 pips), use a multiplicator over 1.6, use a step*x under 1.1 (i.e 0.9) and use the EA on M1 / M5, then you should get something similar to a martingaling scalper. I'd advise you to use the trend filter though, using an ADX under 20 and an ADXMA under 50.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks, will test it and post the results. Just to let you know that I'm also testing a just sell orders chart and a just buy orders chart with some success(of course as eur/usd is ranging for quite some time, will have to wait to see what happens when there's news or if starts trending. This creates a virtual hedge that has nothing to do with the original version, but hey, is just a test

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks Edo, great update! I would give it a try in real account after one month demo on my vps, great work!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Is it possible to optimize this for faster backtests? It currently takes about 5 minutes to backtest a week of data, whereas it should normally take about 10-40 seconds. Let me know if I can help in any way.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Edo, Thanks for sharing ur Ea. So far backtest is smooth. Regarding updated version, do we have to place the Indies in mt4 for supporting Ea? Also, how does the Ea analyse the news from the Indi (IN TERMS OF brokr GMT server time)?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Edorenta The trend indicator works on what kind of TF? Can you create an external variable to select the trend TF? gilfx

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Looking Better now! thanks~ The next step for this EA is to increase profit, i suggest you take remon hunt v26 as a model. What i mean is to give this EA a safety threshold when in a trending market. EX. supposing we put it on H1, if the trend is really strong, it will buy at every bearish candle with a max limit of 3 orders. That's the way remon increase profit for his EA.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
2 Problems my friend, pls. dont delete any trading arrows when EA is stopped, leave it and we can check the order movement and find the weakness. why there are no trades on the pic, according to ADX filter it is a down trend.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I have a really good suggestion! It will double the profit with no more risk added. If stuck in buy and distance from the first BUY order &gt; XX points ( depending on ATR), sell function will be activated. viceversa Another easy approach is Total BUY lots &gt;= 4 X lot size, start sell (with increased lot maybe?). Total SELL lots &gt;= 4 X lot size, start BUY . Market is always tricky, before a big fall it is always looks like a good long trend.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Maybe it's the news filter, if that's the case it's a good sign, that the EA is working as it should, impact news level 3 = no trade

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You can find enclosed a version that doesn't clean up the chart on deinitialization. As for the ADX trend, as Kornrogers figured, the ea simply does not trade when this kind of move occurs. This is done in order to focus on ranging markets. Let me remind you that this is not a trend-trading EA, it has no mean to trade such moves. What you're describing here my friend is an hedging approach, as I said I don't plan on working on an hedging EA yet. Switch the following settings to false, it will prevent the EA from calculating useless data in order to optimize faster.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
listen to me my friend, hedging will double your profit with no more risk. EX. stuck in buy for 2-3 days, switch to sell does not cost your money but only increase your profit. For the trend filter can not save your EA from the big fall, counter trading is the only way to get out.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hedging is easy to implement. Getting out of a hedged scenario (profitably) is not so easy... How would you recommend this be done? Regards Vlad

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thank you for sharing your approach. I'll look into it. Btw could you tell me what version of MT4 you're using and what's your screen resolution? I ran some tests on several computers and my InfoBox looks much better on my screens than it does on yours, no idea why

--- 帖子 #61 ---
NO you get me wrong! my friend This is not kind of Hedging you are talking about.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
version 988..... no problem at all..... There is a change you have not mentioned my friend.... If we turn the ADX filter on, why EA will slow down the lots increase rate? That's good but how does it work?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
any setfile of this ea or use as default setting

--- 帖子 #64 ---
As I told before, I'm running two charts, one with just "sell" orders and one with just bye "orders", it works with no problems. Of course the profit from the "trending" order is minimal cause it only opens the smallest lot and closes in TP in the direction of the trend, while the other order is increasing lot sizes (martingale) doing it's normal retracement behavior, nevertheless, is some profit. I can't see other way to do this without get stuck in "hedge open positions problems" (other than the one that EG104 does). We could also increase the lot in the trending positions(like piggy permits), but this would need to be done manually, and I don't think this is Edorenta goal when he designed the EA. I think this was about building the most safest martingale EA, and for the record I think Edorenta have done a great job. With all of this, I'm not saying that there's no ways to improvement, thanks for your contributions friend jonirrenicus. Let's build the best grid EA ever

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I'll try something similar. I think that the EA misses counter-cycle opportunities as it gets stuck in a position waiting for a retracement. Could you share your early results? Are you using the ADX trend filter? Cheers

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nothing in my code is meant to lead to such a slow down.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
That happened to me while visual backtesting, but live running it, the trend order closes the positions normally when it reaches TP line. While the other chart is doing the martingale approach. I was doing this with the first version with no adx. I think a buy and sell order opened at the same time, one doing martingale and the other just booking profits in the direction of the trend is easy to do? Don't you think, at least for start...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
You know what, that's exactly what i'm thinking. This kind of EAs are wasting pips in a trend by doing nothing but waiting. I believe counter-trading will not only increase the profit but also allow your stuck positions to get out earlier. for EX. Attached Image (click to enlarge) if you only buy, price will never retrace back to your TP. (dead) But if you also sell, you already in profit before the market move down further. (live) NOTES: if we increase lot size too quickly and trend reversed, it will blow up.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
ok, pls. test it on MAY 31th G/U M5. you will find the difference.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I don't know it it's the same thing, but I have one open cycle now of buy orders, while the trend is down, and the orders are 0,02, 0,02, 0,04 , 0,06 and 0,02 again? Shouldn't it be 0,12?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
You've probably shut the expert down and started it over on the chart, or reloaded MT4.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
At first I thought about that, but it opened the order in the same step size, and with the same TP of the others orders :S Wait, I did reload MT4 to test the AP 4.3 version...maybe it's that... Now, with the AP 4.3 version this problem is solved?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
It's not a problem, it is just that the lot management starts over when you restart the EA. The magic being the same the EA will manage the old orders TP, but won't calculate the new lot based on the old cycle

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You can find enclosed the sets I'm using to run FT on Autop 4.3. I did not optimize anything, but the results are quite steady on most pairs. (results are SHORT ONLY)

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Just one more thing, not wanting to overpost or monopolize the thread. I've tried to change the settings as your suggestion to create a scalping version, that would work on ranging markets, and I did with some success. It opens and closes orders fast and successively, but sometimes, when the order goes in the direction of the trend, it doesn't close the order in profit, and keep it open for a long time. Anyway to overcome this without manually closing the order? Or it's a problem in my settings?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Because you have "Keep open positions in trend" selected to "true"

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ok, gonna try it.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Thanks for share Edorenta. Good

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Something rong with the TP?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hey bud, there seems to be a little glitch on JPY pairs, I'll fix it Friday as I'm away for 2 days, so do not use the EA on those yet

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thanks for the suggestion, but it didn't work, it keeps the position in profit with no TP line. Anything else i can try? I leave here the set file.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hi friends i am backtesting this Ea but it is very slow why? i turned off visual mode but it is very very slow up to now i saw good and low DD but the profit is not good enought it is about 70% in a year means 5.8% per mount with 0.1 lot

--- 帖子 #83 ---
finaly it finished good resault

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks, but it didn't seem to make a difference.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
thanks for the EA and I run it on my real micro account with my VPS. I set it in the EURUSD M1 chart,from the last two days result, it is profitable. If anything surprise or accident occurred, I will show it on here. If I didn't post any new reply with screenshot then I am earning money with the AP3.0

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Turn on ADX filter Attached Image (click to enlarge) Turn OFF Attached Image (click to enlarge) Better turn it off...

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Which adx parameters are you using for your filter? Try smaller ones. Btw I didn't say the filter will always get you out of DD or experience less exposure, but it can. At least that's the way I trade

--- 帖子 #88 ---
it is a two side argument...you can say it is "useless" when it is the time you showed in your chart but it can also lower your DD/exp. less exposure out of your snapshots. The main purpose of trying something new or add on function, we should try to use it/adjust it not try once and blame that "thing". See deeper,don't only look at the surface...

Hi Edorenta, as I'm quite new to fx trading, i have been testing and trying out lots of different EAs yet. But this one You created here is impressive. Running live with a conservative config without martingal and testing/demo on an also conservative martingal - both running save and profitable until now. @all: Since I do absolutely don't know much about most of the available custom indicators, I'm trying to understand the meaning or better the difference of the two parameters "Use FFcal for the 2 chart currencies" (my setting ist FALSE in my enviroments) and "Use TSD Cal" (set to TRUE for EUR and USD - since I'm trading EURUSD only at the moment). Thanks in advance for Your kind relplies!

Could you add ECN option It will open trade and place SL and TP at the same time Then we can backtest more quickly I think

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Wise words Sagera, if the price didn't retrace at all in this example, the filter would have saved the account. Why? Simply because the raw Grid would have kept expanding against the trend and the exposure would have lead to an obvious margin call. Now the price there has retraced, hence the raw grid could eventually close up the cycle sooner and with less exposure (luckily?) Welcome Barlam, these two are similar news filters. One is based on the Firex Factory calendar through the updated FFCal custom indicator imports, The other is based on Forex TSD custom import (developed on their forum and implemented in the EA) i have not tried them both yet hence I am not sure it works flawlessly yet.

This EA is good but it will blowup account eventually... I tested from 2012 Jan to Aug &amp; It shows great profit with medium DD till April but when it comes to May 2012 well... EA showing its true color... For limit order - May 2012 will eat you up EA &amp; whole account &amp; Feb 2012 will blowup Stop order ONLY way to stop this by using equity stop ... If you dont... then say goodbye to your precious account... It will blow up eventually today or tomorrow Edit: Sorry I mixed up with another EA... as in this EA there is NO stop order or limit... therefore, I found trending month is deadly &amp; that was May 2012

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I'll look into it. Did you try backtesting with an ECN already? I can feel that you're a very constructive member Well martingales are risky strategies, there is nothing new here. What we're trying to do is work on a better way of identifying ranging markets and moving markets along with working on order and lot management. If you're just here to cry cause you've burnt a demo or failed to backtest the EA successfully, please find an other thread to spread your negativity. (If you manage to backtest the EA with a simulated news filter along with the right ADX filter optimised over the 6 previous months (november 2011 to may 2012), the EA will swim through most of the pairs smoothly barely exposing your account. Run relevant backtests and come back with helpful advice or do not participate on here thank you.)

Hi Edo So far new version is working great...l use it demo on EU, UC Since almost 3 days= amazing 680P Gain for max martingale of .10 Lot... instead of .34 (previous version) Filters seems to do a great job so far...Keep going mate...Will continue testing and posting... You got my attention...seems promissing... Thanks

Hey Ben, do not hesitate to share your results. 680P = 680%??

Hi Edo l did 68$ on .01 Lot since the new version But 104.66$ since sunday as you can see below...just amazing If l am not mistaken 68$ is 680 Pips... Happy if my results can help

Hi Just answered above...yes

--- 帖子 #101 ---
hey, nice job on the EA. I have been testing various similar EA and so far, yours is on the top of my list. There is one problem tho, the time filter does not seem to work. In the strategy tester, if I use start 00:00 stop 02:00 (or anything really), the EA opens positions all day long. Can you take a look? Also, as a programmer, is there any change we will get the source code eventually? One thing I coded in another EA was an 'Emergency Trade' option, which would open a single position with a high multiplier in the opposite direction in case a grid goes bad (a threshold in points would define 'when' its time to open the emergency trade), to try and recover from the loosing positions. It can't fix every case of account blow up, but the way I see it, since it's about to blow anyway, if I can save 1 blow up out of 3, it becomes acceptable on the long run. Anyhow, keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi ben.deschain, what timeframe did you use for such amazing results?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
what is your demo broker? Is it ECN or STP broker? Because I did't see the charge per transaction. I am curious that can this EA use in STP? because I think the ECN broker did worse in this month, the slippage too high (&gt;4pips), average spread even nearly 1.1...Still the above question, I don't know can this EA using in a STP broker. I think the main point we need to do here is test and suggest based on the origin EA. Your idea can pass to the Edo( the EA creator) and I think Edo has the great ability to implement the code if it can help. But after two and a half days of trading by this EA, I still don't have any suggestion.... It is still running great.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi In post 3 l saw screenshots from Edo were M1...Did presume that was the one... Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Sagera Broker was regular Alpari Demo MT4 and of course commissions and/or rollover aren't there... Just switch few hours ago to my live broker still on DEMO TESTING ( with com/rollover included) Let see if commissions will affect results that much...l am curious too Have changed currencies too... But rollover should not be an issue as trades don't stand all night long. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #106 ---
thanks for your info and sorry for my bad english . I think it is my broker problem because I was using some scalp EA and maybe the broker flagged me...so the slippage was too high for me. The commission is not a problem but I would like to see some different result from STP to determine which broker I should change/remain.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Edo With your permission have few questions As l said previously to Sagera :Just switch few hours ago to my live broker still on DEMO TESTING ( with com/rollover included) from Alpari What is the take profit by default...Wasn't sure...Is this 21 at line: ATR HILO Period for dynamic TP ? Anyway Alpari showed 30 sometime 37...Do not know where that come from... lf l want to increase TP as it appear only 14 with my broker FXCM for NZDCAD...and it is not enough... Also for an unknow reason TP doesn't show up on my second chart...AUDCAD tried several time...takes trades but no TP Do you think this issue is broker related?? Have Version is 4 build 988...Had no problem in the past...Do you have any idea or clue? Thanks for your help

Thanks Fibo38 i added it like you showed it above but i am still getting the error but only if i change the settings like i describe below. I just realized i only get the error file not found ffcal.exe when i change the input on the ea where it says "Use ffcal for the 2 chart currencies" i changed it to TRUE instead of False. Am i supposed to keep it to false? If i leave it to FALSE it is fine i do not get the error anymore. But i do no get any trades at all i have it set up for an hour so far but still no trades. Just wandering is that normal?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
[Quote = smahil; 9030952] Gracias Fibo38 he añadido como lo mostró anteriormente, pero todavía estoy recibiendo el error, pero sólo si puedo cambiar la configuración como yo describo a continuación. Me acabo de dar cuenta sólo consigo el archivo de errores ffcal.exe que no se encuentra cuando cambio la entrada en el ea donde dice "Use ffcal para las 2 monedas de gráfico" i cambiado en TRUE en vez de Falso. ¿Se supone que la mantenga a falso? Si lo dejo a FALSO que está bien no me sale el error más. Pero yo no conseguir cualquier operación en todo lo que tengo configurado por una hora hasta ahora, pero todavía no hay oficios. Si pasea es eso normal? [/ Quote] I do not know see if edoranta, have if we can clarify, sorry

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Ben, as said in Post #1, the TP is based on current HiLo and ATR values. The exact formula I use is: Current HiLo * HiLo weight + ATR * ATR weight + raw pips. If you want the EA to trade wider on NZDCAD (in your example) you have 2 solutions: highering the timeframe so that the dynamic TP is basically higher, or add some raw pips (i.e. 5) Let me advise you to cut with the exotic crosses such as NZDCAD. The extended spread you'll trade with will eventually wipe all your profits out Try opening your MQL4 editor and compiling the FFCal to make sure you obtain the .ex4. Double check if you put it to the right folder as well. This should not happen. Hi Sagera, if your broker flagged you, just get a proper/other one.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Do you mean that it keeps the positions open or just keeps trading? I've just ran a test with your settings (00:00 to 02:00) and it works fine by me, have a look:

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I backtested with Pepperstone broker. This EA firstly opens an order and then modify TP, SL. It takes time. But some broker may not allow to execute the order and modify it at the same time So It is necessary to have an input option for the EA to open trade and modify TP-SL at the same time or not Example for two types in the below pic https://i.gyazo.com/af7e82bbffb1e923...1241e8a15f.png

Hi Edo, I guess there's some problem with news filter. Ea just opened new trade with the forex tsd filter onn ( There's red news in half hour ). Regards, FxRhino.

That is in fact kind of what i thought of, but I've not been shure... Now some more Feedback from my tests... Once more... I love this EA, especially the TP calculation seems to be awesome ! I did backtesting with Your settings from #Post 74 (only short) on EURUSD and detected a critical zone in the beginning of february 2016 (especially on lower TF with some lower balance) and crashing in 2014 (I think it was september - as i did not save the results ). As I said, I'm also doing testing on demo account. Yesterday I realized, that the EA entered with new trades in the timebox where it should not, because of the hogh impact news from US. As I'm in Germany it was 14:30 (2:00pm) over here for the news. Please see my settings and the order history in the picture. Attached Image As there should not be any new entries (plz, get me right, I really mean the opening of new grids) in the timebox of 90min before and after that news. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Writing this I saw the EA entering again, waiting only some more minutes for news from the US (high impact). Plz see the pics. Attached Image Attached Image (click to enlarge) As I added the indicator itself, You can see, that my settings might not be the problem, because it shows the right time until the news. (I thought there might be a prob because of the GMT offset). For information - I use Activtrades as my broker. I'm sorry if I made mistakes in my configuration. In that case, I really appreciate Your help. Cheers!

Thank you for the feedback bros, I knew there was something wrong with my code. I'll work that out next week! I'm going to remove the TSD Cal component and work on a better working FFCal addon Hey Bazze, hope you're doing well. Thanks for sharing your results, keep doing so! What pairs are you trading?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
New release: version 4.5 - ADX trend filter is now external - Some bugs corrected (JPY pairs) - Survival mode (!!!!!! Remon Style, but better ) - TSD Cal news filter has been disabled, I'll focus on a pure FFCal addon. Cheers, Edo

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Many thanks Edorenta !!!!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thanks Edo On what timeframe do you suggest?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thanks Edorenta, yours is the best, tested many. AP_4.3 survived AUDJPY 140pips move up during night hours.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Guys Here an update : Unfortunately that doesn’t work with FXCM .. same as l picked ‘’non exotic’’ currencies... Behavior is erratic...trades close prematurely in negative...For some currencies TP don't show up... Probably a bug on the Broker side…Last version 4.5 didn't change anything. It seems that l will have to open another live account if l want to try it live one day... If someone get it works properly with them...please let me know... Just curious...Bazze- Sagera: What is your live Broker? Thanks guys to continue sharing your live results...will follow it anyway...

--- 帖子 #125 ---
What settings are you using? Are you demoing? ECN? Try longer timeframes and tell me if the EA still behaves the same way

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Edo Regular Settings just set false info box and EA name for testing purpose It is my live Broker but on DEMO testing...They claimed to be NO DEALING DESK FOREX EXECUTION means non market maker but ECN...don't know...l will try longer TF... Keep you posted Have a nice WE EDIT: On M5 TP showed up on those 3 currencies l have tried so far...keep you posted EDIT2: erratic behavior is back...As you will see below Both sell EU displayed closed in negatif for no reason... During that time another sell was trigerred at the same place it shot down previously... Also unusual behavior... have double commission charged for each trade...Never saw that before...Then you see what l mean by erratic behavior...A bug somewhere probably on broker side...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
You are right, it works fine, I had misconfigured the GMT offset, nevermind!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You can see it in the pic posted:nerd:....

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Version 4.5 does not produce any profit in backtests. Has anyone figured out what settings have changed from 4.3 to 4.5? I've tinkered with everything and can't get it to trade profitably anymore.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
You're right. I also tried to make all the settings both on the 5.3 version, remove survival mode, but the ea keeps close orders and open new.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
You use the default settings?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well.. I'm not home atm but it has to do with the survival settings for sure. tweak them around. I'll get back to you on monday

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The same happens to me, the new version, in backtests keeps closing position is losses. Setting survival mode to false doesn't solve. I'm sure Edorenta will work this around. Thanks for your hard work Edorenta, i really think you are on the right track. I would kindly ask, when you have time, that you update your post one, and briefly describe every feature of your EA. If we have a clear perception of what every feature and setting does, will be able to optimize results for different pairs and different market conditions. Every experienced trader or programmer easily know how the EA works, just from looking at the settings, but, me for example, I'm having a hard time, trying to configure the best settings, cause I don't know what most of them do. Sorry for this, and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Same problem, v4.5 closed the position in loss. Hopefully it will be corrected by Edo

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi everyone, New release : version 4.6 (corr 4.7) - Survival mode is now fixed - New option called "ADX Trend Hedge" meant to hedge your current position when the filter switches On . This position will close as your current cycle closes. This option has proven to lower the DD heavily on many of my tests. I'm working on some optimization to run a trade explorer that I will attach to the thread. Cheers, Edo

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi Edo, as I'm running long term backtests on two machines (4.3 ignoring 4.5) with different settings, I will test 4.6 tomorrow and give some feedback these days! Once more, thanx for Your hard work! One more question. I was wondering how the option "Keep open positions in trend" is supposed to work. My first thought was kind of trailing of open positions in the detected trend, but that does not make really sense as the TP is set on the chart. So I think disabling this option would close open positions when a trend is detected? (I could not yet recognize this behaviour, but I did not really focused on testing this by now.) Cheers, Barlam

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi Barlam, The way it works is really simple: The ADX accelerates, indicating that a trend initiates whatever the direction it is. If you tell the EA to close the open deals when the trend filter switches on, whatever your current profit is, it will get closed, often resulting in a loss. I'm going to work on a better approach of this trend-exit (i.e only exit if the trend seems to be sideways relatively to our current cycle)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks for the hedge add-on, gonna test it out.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Just corrected a glitch related to the hedge orders sending "OrderSend Error 138" Here is the fix:

--- 帖子 #140 ---
... of cause You do and You do it good! Thanks once more for Your answer. A tiny little idea for the EA- just to think about by Yourself perhaps: As one of my test settings (based on sageras set from #post 8) relies on non martingal (set to 2) and seems to be kind of stable (at least back to 01.01.2014 long&amp;short), it would be interessting to see what happens with linear increments instead of a factor martingal. If You too think it might be interesting, we would have to think about the base value for an increment. Even with fixed base lot it might be nice to have an own setting for the incerment value. Otherwise that would be a problem with % based base lot. What do You thing? Worth some brain energy? Might be not, as I'am definitly no expert. Barlam

​one option could be also to use quadratic (or more) equations to drive lot weight during a counter trend. For example I use y=0.000009*xE6 in my strategy where y is the lot amount and x the number of orders. if properly managed it can survive a &gt;1000 pip move in the opposite direction. I also use hedging during these moves as it keeps the DD acceptable

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi Edo, Could you add new features like tradeonmonday = true/false for all weekdays, so that we can switch on/off the EA for days that have huge economic data releases? Thanks !

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Sorry for my late reply..I use VantageFX Raw ECN account. In the screenshot below, you can see the profit earned in this two day (minus the profit in my post #118). I take the liquidity risk on friday because a great downhill occurred on EU (M1) and I think the pairs would retrace to the previous price. At last, it really retrace.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hey Huatboyz, I'll implement a day of the week filter with hedging-over option. Stay tuned Sorry dude, I just fixed it. I was quite tired as coding yesterday.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Autop stable release : v5.1 New features: - hedge over time filter (i.e. you can just hedge your trades as the time filter is on without having to close them in loss.) - sharp entries option : the trades are confirmed by the ADX - one-sided trend filter : allow the expert to take trades toward the momentum in trend

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Would you please give some setting?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Awesome, that should work very nicely.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Edo, already testing... but the last version with stable profitable results in backtest was 4.3. What I recognized on 4.9 and even 5.0 yet is, that even with martingal turned off, fixed lot at 0.01 and hedge off, the EA opens positions with e.g. 0.02 in the opposite direction of the actual grid, often closing them along with the TP of the grid resulting in (small) loss altogether. I think that might be the way the hedging is meant to work - but as I said, hedge is turned off. Another thing is, I always (with every new version) try to recreate the settings and results of a former version, but even with the "same" settings I do not get the results (at least until now) of my extensive BT of the 4.3. To get it together... How can I/we help You to find possible problems? Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello Edorenta Nice EA and thanks for this hard work. I am using your AP_4.5 and please see the attached results and settings if there is something wrong. I have not changed any of your default settings. All trades were taken with these default settings.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Barlam, once more, thanks for taking part of the improvements and giving me your feedback. If you turn all the filters off, disable the ADX hedge and the sharp entry you should have the exact same EA as 4.3 used to be. Cheers mate, Edo ( 5.1 enclosed )

--- 帖子 #162 ---
The reason for your loss is because you're running the EA on M1 with thin TP, your spread and commissions eat all your potential profit. Please upgrade to version 5.1 and run some tests on higher TF such as M5/M15. I'll come back to you with some setfiles

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thanks Edo and I shall await those setfiles.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
You know what, I'm just running a BT from 01.01.2016 until 18.07.2016 on EURUSD M1 (long &amp; short) with a Martingal config on 4.3. Afterwards I will use these settings along with Your suggestions above on 5.1 and post both results - whatever they may be - to give You some concrete feedback (may be tomorrow). Cheers Barlam

Hi Edo! First you are the Best!!! But i have an idea, in TF 15/30 i cant trading safty, i know that this EA is good, but when come a Big Candle, we are loosing everything. An SL is good for everybody. I tested your Bot, and is good!!! Cheers Blaid

This idea, that in 15/30 TF , when the adx bone trend changed, than you are better make a 15-20 pip SL, that your money in safe to be. I studing businees, i am not a programmer, but the rule here is a little bit high.

Thanks edorenta, i'll try to help with BT. Currently my TradeExplorer, here in FF, is working in real account (overly small, i know it) with 4.2 version with good results. It's trading in 5M and 15M, in two charts. Both works correctly, but in 15M chart, the black data table seems not to be working correctly. In any case, this is the best ea i have never seen.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I'm really happy to see that your account already grew 22%, do not forget to withdraw your deposit as soon as you reach the 100% threshold to be mind-freed of stress related to the EA. We'll work and do whatever we can to get this among the most profitable grid EAs. At least I'll do my best

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi Ed.. Thanks for your EA. New version is closing trades in no time.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Please switch the setting "Close the hedge as time-filter switches off" off as I said above, the error comes from there

Hi all, whether You may needed or not. As promised attached You find my results for EURUSD M1 BT from 01.01.2016 until 18.07.2016 in 4.3 and 5.1 with the "same" settings as suggested by Edo. (I know about the modelling quality, but it is comparable as You can see). In fact those results are almost the same! As I'm neither at home nor in office the next days I cannot go on BT with some powerful hardware these days. But I will do so, besides other tests of course, recreating those settings and results with newer versions. The sets (optimized for BT) are attached too. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Feedback is as welcome, as suggestions to change settings or do additional tests. Cheers Barlam

Thank You..

Hi Edorenta, first, thanks for all your hard work and sharing it here. It is appreciated. Subscribed to thread. Started testing on a demo starting today. I'm running V5.2 on 3 pairs, AUDUSD, USDCAD, and USDJPY, starting with a Bal of US$1000. The last time I tested one of the grid EAs the DDs were so bad I never bothered with it much. I'll let this run 24/7 for a few days and see what happens. Thanks again.

[quote=troya7634;9038338]{quote} I tried to backtest those set files but I cant do it. This message appears a lot of days and i dont know why (my lot is correct, 0.1) The problem appears in one and two set files both. hi edorenta, and everybody. BT with v5.2 returns the same problem than reported with previous version one; any idea about this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #194 ---
hi am getting this auto v5.2 EURUSD,M5:0.02Error: 0 any help guys. Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Edo, many thanks for the upgrade. Can we add a feature, stealth mode (meaning tp levels are invisible to brokers)? if we set TP levels as visible levels to brokers, i am afraid sometimes some brokers may play around with quotes and not get us filled. many thanks !

--- 帖子 #196 ---
@Edo: Push! I already also thought about that option - but I think because we have such a nice cockpit in this EA we should see the actual TP target there? Btw. the 4.3 and 5.1 BT from my recent post is running in 5.2 now... Feedback comming. Cheers

--- 帖子 #197 ---
@Edorenta Thank you for this very promising EA. Currently I am running a "tick level" backtest on M1 EURUSD data from 2012 and the preliminary results of the first 4 months (shown below) look pretty good. (Backtesting this EA on M1 "tick level" is somewhat slow: analyzing 1 month's data takes almost 1 hour, so the final result is expected in about 2 days from now...) I wonder if it was possible to incorporate a "Risk Setting" parameter which could be used as an alternative for a fixed starting lot size. In other words: the EA would automatically calculate and adjust the starting lot size based on the actual current balance. For example: Risk Setting: 1 = 0.01 lot/$1k (as trading 0.01 lot equals approx. $1k) while Risk Setting: 0 would mean using the current fixed starting lot size. Attached Image (click to enlarge) P.S. Unfortunately my backtest has stopped with an "Ordermodify error"... Attached Image

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi,that is already possible. It is % based. Set fixed Lot size to false and choose % value two options below. I already tested it, proven working.CheersBarlam

--- 帖子 #199 ---
@Barlam Thanks! In my backtest the balance has almost doubled in the first four months of 2012 (from $3000 to $5400), but the starting lot size is still 0.01. I guess I have to wait for the balance to grow more to see the automatic lot size increase. For example: if the base "Risk setting" were 0.01/$10k then it will take about 1.5 year to see the first lot size adjutment in my ongoing $3k deposit backtest.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Two pairs, v5.1 and v5.2 identical settings on M1, too good to be true

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi andres, Would you mind to post the set once more? Good work mate!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
okay, here..

--- 帖子 #203 ---
one question, what if during news time e.g. ECB conference and we have some open positions, this is potentially a risk? any solutions to avoid the potential huge drawdown?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
and another demo acc. v5.1 today. I am testing several pairs on many accounts. This account produces more gain but I prefer settings in my post 212

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Sorry, wrong picture regarding my settings above

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I want to ask, it must to add adx and adxma indi to the chart? it has any correlation with the parameter set? and if it has correlation. the value of adx is different. on default set is 35 and 10 (linear weighted) and in the indi is 150 and 25 (simple) method. it must to change? or just follow the default?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Any chance you can improve backtesting speed? Disabling the infobox doesn't improve speeds at all. Thanks for all your hard work on the development!

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I have also OrderModify error 130 which block the backtest.​ And on my side, it takes few hours to test 1 month on m1 chart tick data. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Same here EDO... Another suggestion, i don't know if this is possible, as we know this EA in ranging markets is 100% secure, in a large trend that's when the problem occur. As the distinctive feature of this EA is the fact that it expands the grid when there is a trend, and you already inserted the hedge feature, we could also increase the lot size in the hedge size by simple increment and the retracement side with the normal multiplier. So for a 2 multiplier it would work like this. Retracement side - 0,01;0,02; 0,04; 0,08; 0,16; 0,32; 0,64; 1,28 Hedge (trend side) - 0,01; 0,02; 0,03; 0,04; 0,05; 0,06; 0,07; 0,08 If it's not that easy to do.. at least take something from the idea..cause i think it could prevent a larger DD.. Thanks EDO

--- 帖子 #221 ---
By using "Open Price Method" the backtest has managed to get through the "OrderModify error 130" . Although the results with this method are not too accurate, they are accurate enough to mark when a "Martingale DEATH SEQUENCE" happens.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
it is very hard to decide whether it is a trend or not. There are so many false break out in this market, especially on GBP pairs. You think it is a trend and it turns out a false break out, a even larger DD will happen.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Thank you for the settings Barlam. For those who wonder, this settings may be the most profitable ones, but does not care about any filter and keeps on entering the market, waiting for a retrace at any point. Hence a big move (such as a news hike) can lead to extreme DD. However I'm still testing similar settings with success, surviving the 5000 trades threshold easy. Hey Bobby, DD is ultimately inherent to grid strategies, now this strategy is about how to limitate it, maximizing our Calmar ratio (Profit over max DD). Thanks for joining the journey MasterGuru. Just as Zilla you're a man of wise words on this forum and I appreciate your feedback and your backtests. I'll look into my code to optimize its speed, however I'm now close to 2000 lines of code and loads of TP/Step/Hedge calculation functions and calls that make tick testing quite tough. I totally agree with you. If we were able to identify trends that well we wouldn't be working on such strategies hence a scale-hedge would come along with fewer profit if the market retraces and hits our retrace-TP.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
With any Martingale, the "death sequence" is practically unavoidable on an average "retail trader" account. On the other hand, if the EA can produce average 500% (non-reinvested) profit with average 3 total crashes per year, it translates to 200% profit per year, assuming that the profits are withdrawn on a regular basis. In summary: a good Martingale setting is not necessarly the one without crashes, but one with net yearly profits including the unavoidable crashes .

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Quoting jonirrenicus {quote} it is very hard to decide whether it is a trend or not. There are so many false break out in this market, especially on GBP pairs. You think it is a trend and it turns out a false break out, a even larger DD will happen. I totally agree with you. If we were able to identify trends that well we wouldn't be working on such strategies hence a scale-hedge would come along with fewer profit if the market retraces and hits our retrace-TP. I understand you guys, and it was just a suggestion. I know that this would lower the profit, but my idea was to change it to be more safe, with less drawdawn when heavy trends occur. Beside this, I don't think you totally understand me, cause we would not need to know if a trend is on or not, cause the hedge(trend) positions would be open exactly on the same step as the retracement. I believe we could have the both ways, the one that masterguru is talking about, with bigger profit, and some crashes, and the one with less crashes and less drawdawn.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This is the result From 13/7/2016 in my real account, I will post the details after few hours/days. Still in great condition and small drawdown still using 4.3 with default setting，just changed the martingale multipler to 1.1

Hello First I want to apologize for my bad English, this is not my native language. [IMG]file:///C:\Users\Jean\AppData\Local\Temp\msohtmlclip1\01\clip_image001.gif[/IMG] Thanks Edorenta for your share. I am trying to make a long backtest Autop 5.2 from the 01/08/2008 to today. But there is a problem. Please look at capture from the journal. Thanks for help Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #228 ---
On 7/21/2016. at the start of the Asian session, I changed my demo acct. to 4 pairs, usdcad, eurchf, audjpy, and audusd. v5.2, settings from post 212, TF = M1. Began with an actual Balance of $992.11 after losing $8 on 2 pairs during the previous 2nd half of London and full NY session. The results are better. There were a few big hits, but as long as the account survives and recovers that's OK. Trade Explorer synched from 7/21 is here http://www.forexfactory.com/#acct.81-tab.report

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi, thank you for the details. Would you let me know what was your maximal DD ?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi Edo, I am following the FT with version 4.3. Today during news of ECB the Ea opened extra 2sell n one buy trade with the already existing grid in which all trades had tp level set. Those weird trades didn't had any tp placed. Was that normal? I checked journal but there was no error. FYI, I have disabled add filter.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
As the below backtest shows: SHORT - and even medium - TERM results can be very deceiving for stability (i.e. without the crash scenario). The EA was working perfectly (with an experimental parameter set) from January 1st, 2012 for almost 22 months straight, until the "death sequence" happened on October 18th, 2013. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #232 ---
this perfectly demonstrates why when trading martingale every trade could be your last. only trade these systems if you are willing to withdraw profits regularly

--- 帖子 #233 ---
At least 4/5 times of profit..that goes with your idea of withdraw whenever we double the account at least. The problem is if the death sequence occurs in the first place

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Exactly! Which also means that anticipating a certain number of "crash events" one should have at least 2-3x "reserve deposit" available to be able to start over.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
nice work are you going to add the time filter??

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Could you show me your experimental sets? I'm curious about the steps and multiplier you used. As well as the trend filter / hedge settings. (Btw an equity stop at 30% of the account might have saved you from this death sequence, the question now is to know whether it would have been hit several times across your test or just along this sequence.)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Well, I have run multiple experimental sets over the past 24 hours and it was one of the two attached below. Currently I am testing settings with $10k deposit and 20% Equity Stop by which I can simulate multiple small ($2k-$5k) account crashes without actually crashing the test account. According to the preliminary results the first 20% DD happened after 15 months with an approx. 8% average monthly profit until that point, i.e. only 2.5 months of profit were wiped out, although the recovery time might be longer due to Dynamic MM. Not bad Calmar Ratio if it remains so...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thank you for your time, looking forward to your preliminary results. What time filter are you talking about?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
If you use martingale multiplier, you will blow your account many times (e.g.: 2016/4), you can see Barlam's post #200, start from $500 from 2016/1 and the result is great but if you start in 2016/4, your account blew up very soon. We can use martingale with some luck but we may meet the death sequence when you are in the very beginning... So we must study the death sequence of this EA. First we can see and regconize the sequence then we may code. But MasterGuru, may you provide the 2013 trade record here? Then we can see the trade start from which day and use different indicators to see the sequence. Regards! P.S.: Below are EURUSD 2013/10 H1 and H4 chart, you may observe the huge price action at 16/10 to 17/10. This action is very sudden from ranging to upward trend.

Seems like Troya's account is doing pretty well so far : http://www.forexfactory.com/troya7634 Troya would you share your settings? Thx

--- 帖子 #241 ---
@sagera In my opinion 0.01 lot/$10k is the highest risk setting for any Martingale to survive long term, so the mentioned $500 deposit is destined to crash. The "only" problems with $10k deposit is that the yearly profit % is very small for the risk taken. 2012 seems to be a smooth sailing year for almost any setting, however, 2013 is very "rocky", so whoever is doing backtests I suggest starting with this difficult year of 2013 (at least that is what I am doing).

Team, as we're trying all these different set files and version, want to give you my input as I've been trading live for the past several weeks. ONLY way you're going to stay afloat is by having your hedging option turned on. It works wonderfully. If you run it Martingale or as such without the option of a reverse savior than you're going to find with your pant hanging down to your knees at one point or another.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
ANYBODY TRY GBPJPY??

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Wonderful metaphorical but so right! I want to thank Edo and MasterGuru here to point out the sense and nonsense of my sets. These ARE NOT meant to be used on live accounts without customization and (IMPORTANT) more balance. The sets are there to have different versions of the EA "naked" comparable. And we can see through these results (5.2 again shows almost the same results - I'm just not able to post it by now - I'm sorry.) that in fact the basics work in the same way. Now we have to go and turn the right switches to get the EA and the results through the hard times along with a profitable money management. As MasterGuru pointed at and yet could verify it crashes in 5.2 in 2012, 2013 and 2014. So there is a long way to go! Let us take our time, support Edo and share our insights! That's what I try to do here while doing the best I can (Unknown newbie me!) At least I see no point in hiding my results as I do not hurt myself by sharing them, BUT perhaps save someone his hard earned money and by Your feedback also mine I hope! Cheers Barlam

Too high spread for me

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Could you please share Your set file?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yeah, I read some of your post before and $10k is risky, $500 is non-sense at all. But in a short term like this few months, EU is in a very silence ranging market, this would be a great chance for someone only have a little fund. You may say that is not a good chance for us because we don't know when is the ranging market and the trending market...well, that would be the vision of a guy not the EA...In my opinion, EU will not be safe anymore because of some critical news and the brexit so I would find some pairs with keep retracing and smaller price level that trade safer to this thread, I hope we can give a try and help Edo development as well as we can

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sorry for previous quick negative comments... YES, this EA is different but not with the default set... I had to change something &amp; now its amazing I have tested from 2012 Jan to Dec &amp; with only 5% equity stop Its given me back avg 4% ROE per month... &amp; I am using 4.2v kinda better to me

​lot size calculation is not correct. Multiplicator = 1.9 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
The most accurate (tick based) backtests are really slow on M1, however, somewhat faster on M5. Here is an M5 and tick based backtest from 2015.01.04. It might be a start, but still not optimal. Why? I was using fixed 0.01 lot and the max. DD was $2236 with $3000 deposit, so the REAL max. relative DD was -75% (2236/3000). Should the backtest had started on the day of the max. DD - i.e. without accumulating profits before - the report would have shown -75% DD. So some parts of MT4 backtest reports about DD can be misleading. However, increasing the deposit from $3k to $5k would bring the max. DD to 44%, which is still high, but almost tolerable. So next project is running the same settings from 2013 but with $5k deposit.

What was the deposit and the max. $ DD...? These data would be needed for calculation of the industry benchmark, i.e. the Calmar Ratio .

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Modeling quality NA. Anything below 99% is unacceptable in backtest and even 99% can't guarantee it's performance because there is 0 slippage in backtest and no requotes ever. The backtest was invented as a method for code writers to check if their code is performing how it should, open trades based on the conditions and whatever else they input in that code. Later on people started to do backtest on systems to find out that the results from backtest does not match with forward test and not even demo trading is not reliable because of the differences between demo and real. You've been along for quite some time masterguru and should know how unreliable these tests can be. Want a real test? Open a 10$ acc on cent to replicate 1000 $ and the ea can experience real market not the flawless one that you get in demo where spread is always the same for all trades, there are no requotes even for 10.000 trades.

Thank you MasterGuru for your great work . Also i will say thank you to Endorenta and everyone who helps to make this EA. I see me like a beginner and i have testing the Autop 4.3 with using the 1 min set from user endres... . Because i am a not so professionell as the most of you i watch the results from endres 1 minute set and optimized it again so i think it is better for me because i do not like martingale. By using martingale i never can know about when the lot size will go hi and where is the end of them. ! Sorry for my bad english and hope you can understand me !. That what i saw the results from endres set file more trades were right than wrong. After then i have firstly deactivate martingale. Second i change the Fix Lot Factor from 0.01 to 1.0 with max 7 Trades setting because i test it actualy on my little live micro account that i have only for testing in real live modus and not demo. Third Step was change the Base Lot if Fix down to 1.0. The result with backtast on MT4 are good for me. Perhaps someone can optimize my setfile again when i make some wrongs and can put the settings into the Autop 5.2 Version. Here my result about 2 month Backtest AUD_CAD 1 Min.

NA comes from tickstory. But it's actually 99.90%, I experience the same output glitch with my tickstory Pro. Please read carefully as he already said he was backtesting using 99% tickdata If you knew a little about BT, the amount of ticks modeled on his BT should have rung a bell

New Autop stable release : v5.3 New features: - Disable Short Cycles (disabling short cycles will still allow the EA to open short hedges on long cycles) - Disable Long Cycles (disabling Long cycles will still allow the EA to open long hedges on short cycles) Trading Idea: Opportunity mode By running 2 instances of the EA on 2 charts of the same pair, one with Long Cycles disabled, the other with Short Cycles disabled, and using the one-sided trend filter on both , we will make sure that the EA makes money of big moves whatever the direction even if the other gets stuck into a cycle.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) check the 5 trades that are closed around 1.13930 . If spread was at that time 3 pips and my backtest calculates a normal spread of 1.2 than it's inaccurate as hell as that trade would not have been closed and there are many other occasions when spread or slippage are ruining a test. I am not saying that the EA does not do well or it's logic is flawed but backtesting is not forward test. The EA does what you told him to do and does not know the deffinition of maybe.. Maybe later on those trades would have closed but maybe not so having a percentage of DD ex 29% and the actuall being maybe 59% or maybe 101% should raise questions. If i set the spread to 2 pip it may be 4-5 at some time. If i set to 5 although the normal spread offered by broker is 1.5 , i still may have 6-10 pip if market moves fast and what would have closed on demo would be still open on real. How about this one? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or this one ? Notice that i am using every tick and tickstory with current spread as default.

I appreciate your opinion. I agree with you 100% but unfortunately I haven't got enough time to run raw spread BTs (as Capella would do on worlwide-invest). I encourage as many people as possible to run tests with custom sets and share their results. BT can get us on the road to good sets but ofc the market still won't behave the same tomorrow as it did yesterday. I can see your demo acc has grown already, but what scares me is the negative pips (neg edge), could you share your full report and sets please? Thank you for contributing. Hi Imperial, as I said in my previous post you have to change the magic numbers for the Long and the Short setups. Otherwise the EA will aggregate floating datas and mess up with your account, and you don't want this to happen believe me Dude what happened with your TE? Your account was flying still a few hours ago, keep sharing your stats please

--- 帖子 #269 ---
@Matraguna Anyone who has been around on FF for a while knows that - even "tick level" 99.9% - MT4 backtesting has limited use for many reasons (which reasons have been mentioned before), not to mention the fact that open and close prices of each trade are simply simulated by MT4 even in M1 tick level backtesting. But thanks for reminding... On the other hand, having no better options to filter out obviously bad parameter settings , it is still more practical than running 4 years of live forward tests on 5000+ separate $10 funded cent-accounts with all 5000+ possible paramater combinations as suggested. In other words: backtests are reasonably OK to discard useless settings, as parameter combinations which fail in backtests will likely fail in live forward tests, too. In conclusion: Once we manage to get rid of the obviously useless settings we might have left with 10-20 "promising" parameter combinations. And THEN - and only THEN - it is practical to run live account forward tests. At least that is my approach. But please feel free to run all parameter combinations on thousands of 10 USD funded cent-accounts for 4 years and we will be curiously waiting for your results in 2020 ...

[quote=Edorenta;9044007]{quote} I see your live is stuck in the USDCAD cycle, hope it will retrace soon. The move down was mostly news positioning and then the actual news, There are currently 6 longs open on usdcad. 1 is slightly in the money. The other 5 are 35-60 pips south of the border. Luckily the other 3 pairs are doing OK so no danger yet. One of the "endearing" qualities of UC and AU are they are usually concerted opposites. AU and AJ are moving lower at the moment. When the news wears off UCad will probably get back normal. Maybe

Hi Bobby, The Max DD your account came across is really high considering your balance, maybe you should consider safer setfiles? Be careful, I'd be embarrassed you burn those $270 before doubling it

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Yeah, I know it's very risky. If the account does a disappearing act it won't be your fault. You have nothing to be embarrassed about as far as I'm concerned. I'm fully aware what could happen with this strategy. But I think I'll hang in there a while longer. If, and I mean IF, the account doubles I'll withdraw the original deposit and decide from there. I will be interested in how your new strategy with v5.3 goes. Best regards to you an d yours.

I'm forward testing the Opportunity Strategy (a chart for long cycles, a chart for short cycles) on a shitty laptop atm, using the enclosed setfiles on 2xEURUSD, 2xUSDCHF, 2xEURCHF, 2xUSDJPY

Hi Imperial1, I don't know why, but my saved set files won't open here. Sorry. But I just used the exact same settings from andres in post 212. v5.2, TF=M1. Please be careful with a small account on these settings. I've never been accused of being normal, and I don't encourage others to join my cliff diving.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
How could you change the font size of mt4 axis, i think it is bigger than default

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Problem with M1 is that if you trade with small pipstep/step you'll probably recover faster and your cycles are going to fly by like you were scalping, BUT the extensive spread will eventualy wipe most of you profits out and the trend filter is not meant to work on M1. There is no point using M1 if you use an atr/hilo multiplier over 0.8 or an extensive pip offset. It is, to me, much more interesting to trade M15 with tight ADX and TP setups (ATR/HiLo multiplier under 0.5 with no point offset and a step multiplier under 1.2) Windows settings, not in MT4. A lot of inner-fonts can change inside softwares when tweaking windows settings

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi Edo! thanx for sharing and have u opened two charts for each pair? Regards

--- 帖子 #288 ---
As I said in my two lasts posts, yes you have to use 2 separate charts for the two separate setfiles as you can't overlap 2 EAs on the same chart. Do not forget to change the EA magic numbers (already different in the setfiles I gave away) Please read carefully not to make us both waste time

Hi, I put Autop on a demo account last night to test but it isnt trading, am I missing something? thanks

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Edo, I'm trying out lots of different settings these days and thought some time about the spread filter. I guess we could need an option to not only filter high spreads on the start of new cycles but also on new positions in an already running cycle. If think those spreads could have an impact on the effective TP. Let me give You an example on my EURUSD testing: With my broker ( Activtrades ) I have 7 or 8 points spread most of the time and as You can see I do my BT with 10. From time to time the spread goes up to 40 (I just need to look at this very nice Infobox of Your EA ). First thing I did was to deactivate Sunday because this starting hour from 23:00 (11:00pm) to 0:00 always has higher spread. I don't know if that is intended, but it seems to work (last night) although I left the time filter deactived. (Intended that way?). Next I set the maximum spread for new cycles to 10 just to make sure that the average cycles don't need to climb over those high spreads. But now I'm curious because ... let such an cycle have 3 to 5 positions ... if on only one of them the spread rises to that ugly 40 (may it be some worst case...) won't this make it hard(er) for that cycle to hit the TP? May be I'm thinking of a very unimportant point - then blame it on my low experience plz! Btw. I'm also trying hard to give MasterGurus set some edge to get through those death sequences... We will see... Cheers Barlam

Hi all, as promised I owe You the results of my comparable test sets (see post #200 for the results of 4.3 and 5.1) for those newer versions 5.2 and 5.3. Plz see the attached screenshots. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I didn't add the set files just because the settings are the same, ignoring all new possibilities and filters. So, as mentioned before just take these results as an indicator, that the EA in the newer versions works as in earlier versions as the results show! Don't ask me what happended to the diagramm pics as I have no idea why they are scaled up this way. But anyway, don't mind - everything was ok, just the same results as before! More important: I also tested only long and only short on these settings and sadly both ended in a death sequence. It shows that longer lasting cycles sometimes "protect" our balance by preventing the EA from starting another cycle that may end up in a crash... Btw. I just recognized that I set my MT4 to German so those result shots are German. Anyone got problems with that? I could change my language settings to English... But friends, this EA is great! We will find a set and a pair, I'm sure! Cheers Barlam

@Edorenta Unfortunately it was due to a non-retracing trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3 more entry levels and a $10k account would have saved the day from the "death sequence"... which goes with the "general wisdom" that any Martingale with a higher risk than 0.01 lot/10k has very little chance of long term survival.

Hi friend, in fact I cannot, at least not easily, because I messed up the labels by loading and saving an older set. But You can go to page 10 of this thread here and scroll down to post #200, attached you'll find my sets for 4.2 and 5.1. Here is the Link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...79#post9040179 I just used the same settings and disabled everything new. I will repeat this test with every new version (at least until Edo tells me that this is running out of any sense ). But plz, only use that set for testing! It can crash your live account easily. If You do not believe me, see the post from sagera here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post9042281 I could validate his test and yes it crashes if You choose the "wrong" start date for the BT. Of cause You can take this as a basic set and do Your customization... Cheers Barlam

You, better that all of us know how this retracement-type EA suffer from long trends. I believe the hedge add-on from edorenta in the last version could prevent or at least delay the death sequence. I don't see any other way of doing this, as all the EA's of this kind have this problem, so I truly believe that the hedge in-built function is a innovative and major improvement and we are on the right path, I also know that with the hedge function the profit could be less(at least in the same amount of time) but the DD is also smaller. We talked about this, and there's two ways of doing this, withdrawing profits to prevent eventual account blowing, with reserving deposits. This is already possible, with the 4.2 and 4.3 version for instance. Or continue to work in an alternative, with slow and steady version that wins the race. We all know that the market always finds a way to crack our EA's, but Edorenta built a EA with so much variables that I believe if we adapt a total pair range, like AUD/CAD of about 4000 pips, with the right MM, i.e, lot sizes and grid sizes to the account size, and the settings in the EA, I think we can do it. I'm making a lot of tests, and working the concept in excell, hope to achieve something. Nevertheless thanks for your insights Masterguru

--- 帖子 #345 ---
As MasterGuru said, 0.01lot/10k for martingale trading is already the highest risky, I agreed that. So I would like to suggest who trade with smaller fund than 10k like me (only AUD 600 in one account), we can split to accounts in different broker to face different risk and find some proved pairs to hedge our accounts and minimise the risk. Meanwhile, we can close the martingale option, you may say the profit would be lower/ slower.... But after you earned a double like $500 to $1000, then you split that account to two accounts and trade with different pairs, you may not too risky at all. What I am doing now is simple, I earned $100, collect it. After 5 times, I open another account in another broker, trade with few accounts.....Again and again I must say, this EA is doing something great and the algorithm is fantastic.

Hi Sagera, very interesting. On what pairs you use this strategy? One or more pairs? Martingale off, and Scale-in also off? Lot fixed? Thanks!

Here's a backtest from April 6th 2015 to April 11th 2015. Default settings are on, except that the equity stopout is disabled. Anything you would have done differently here, besides the stopout? This trend was too strong and there was never a large enough pullback. 7k loss would be hard to stomach.

To be honest this EA looks very promising and profitable if tweaked the right way and used the best settings(.set). I was just wondering what it's based on like what are the rules that tell it to open an order and what not?!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi sagera, what do You mean with "close the martingale option"? Do You mean money management set to "none" or "scale-in"? Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #352 ---
There are some things you must consider when trading with a martingale EA. This will cut the "death run" short and allow you to ride the gains #1. Set a stop loss for each trade. If you base this on ATR, you will have an exact SL for each pair. If you cannot find the ability to add an ATR SL to each trade, then set a default of 50 pips. These should be trailing stops. #2. Set a breakeven point and trail it. Hide your trail else your broker/bank will find you and kill you. #3. You may use an equity trailing stop. #4. After 2 - 5 (pick your poison here) consecutive stop losses being triggered. Reverse the trades. #5. Grid size should be 5 - 10 This is a standard trading strategy taught by every professional and everyone alike. "Cut your losses and let your winners run" Good luck ! Best Regards, Allisonmagic

Yes EDO, I'm curious to see what will happen when a strong trend occur in the opportunity mode, I've set my hedge amount of trades to 15 and max. amount of trades to 25. I have a TE(it's a high risk profile cause the account is to small, it's just to check EA working), for now it has good results but I only trade eur/usd and this pair is ranging for quite some time, your EA will always profit. I truly believe that hedging is the way to go, when ranging EA's get in trouble, so the development you have made are fantastic, as long as we have the correct settings I think we are close to what we can call a safe EA. Good luck to all in FOMC.

Thanks Sunnybeach for pointing that out, i don't know if that's a bug, but EDO will clarify that, I also need EDO to verify the take profit when there is more than one hedge order open, cause my demo and live account are closing some position at loss. I don't know if this as to do with the auto survive function, and it's meant to be this way, or if it's also a bug. I'm using exactly EDO settings for two charts, buy and sell, and the only modification was the number of hedges number of trades that I've changed to 15. Thanks EDO.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
That is great! can you share the settings please?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Yes, I have the same doubt about the hedge

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hey guys, from what I have seen and understand, along with the hedge orders it is quite normal that a cycle together with it's hedge orders may close in some (minimum) loss. That's the point all about it. You may optimize that by adjusting the hedge size (in %). What was surprising to me infact was, that the loss You describe usually happens in cycles with only some few positions open but ends in profit when there are many open positions in a cycle (where it's getting dangerous). Altogether hedging is dangerous in a "normal" behaving market, because it can slowly eat up your balance the way You described it. Perhaps I'm wrong with my understanding... but may be Edo can clarify... In the end this is one reason, I already asked Edo, if it would make any sense to have an option to decide when to start hedge orders (number of open positions in a cycle or a relative (%) or absolute ($/€) drawdown). Cheers Barlam

Hi sagera, it has been an older post but I'd like to tell You that I managed to get through this "hard time" with version 5.3 even with 500 EUR balance by allowing 15 trades (10 before) and using sharp entries.

That's a good point. I don't take the hedge into account when claculating my TP which often ends up in a loss (cycle profit + hedge loss) in a ranging market. I have not yet figured how to implement an hybrid TP laying on both. This is the reason why I advise to use limited hedge size (under 45% of current positioning size) and 1 max hedge trade . Can I see your setfile please? It seems to me like the equity stop is set way too low and is eating your account, stop after stop . Some more wise words from you my friend I also read your PM about the custom hedge trigger, I will implement it asap. (i.e. : Hedge 1 after X open trades, Hedge 2 after Y open trades.. and so on)

--- 帖子 #378 ---
That might sound funny but I can't understand it. I first thought about a hedge trade, knowing that its size depends on your current total exposure, but given that it's got a TP it can't be a hedge trade. If you could you handle me your current setfile, that might help. None has come yet with such thing as "best sets", it depends on your way of trading and how much risk you're willing to take regarding your growth target.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi fegeme, thx You for Your hint. I know about that (pointed towards this low quality in some former post). As I wrote I did those test mainly to have a comparison between different versions of the EA as Edo provides them for testing. In fact it's only a tick level problem on M1 with my broker. Higher TF do reach up to 99%. I' not getting tired to repeat, not to use that set on a live account. At least not with such a low balance! Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #380 ---
As I said there is no magical sets so far, you can try these around low spread, ranging markets, which is what I am doing atm (following results are 2:30 of trading on many crosses under 2pips spread)

Hi Edo, as usual I'm just happy if my ideas and tests could help in anyway as I'm most of the time not 100% sure if there is so much sense in these approches. If I can help in anyway You might want to direct, just tell me! Otherwise I'll go on following my own weird thoughts... Cheers Barlam

This is great work and as You (and also we in supporting You) do not stop here, we will find some kind of "safe" automatic trading with constant profits over time. So what ever all You guys do... Take Your time and do backtesting. Take Your time and optimize Your set(s). (I know there are many options, but they are there for a reason.) Take Your time and repeat that backtesting again and again. Take Your time running Your set(s) in demo account(s). Be conservative, go live and make constant "safe" profits!

Yes, it's unilateral, no doubt. They are different TF and two different versions. Perhaps this should be tested in two or three accounts, but ..... Really i dont know why, but i'm doong it by the same. Could you give your opinion about this, ?? I'm a rookie in the Olimpyc Games

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I think that you should trade many more crosses in opportunity mode in order to diversify your cycles and partially hedge it. BTW for the ones interested I sometimes close my cycles manually (i.e. ahead of news or when I think the price will break against it) using the enclosed little scripts that I assign to keystrokes (i.e. Alt+L to close a the long cycle on chart, Alt+S to close the short cycle on chart) Have fun with it! See enclosed my results for today, I tried going full M1 on several pairs, using close sets to the ones I gave in my last post. +7%, Max DD +5.5%

--- 帖子 #389 ---
thanks edorenta, i´ll try to apply all this

--- 帖子 #390 ---
So far, So good, this EA is wonderful, tested on a fast internet connection on an ECN server.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The EA has done it's job for the week, so I closing it down Will start it up again on Tuesday. (I refer to post #212 for the set file used.) So far it has been a pipharvester, but for long??? Must stay positive, and hope for the best ...

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Nice!!! What timeframe? And could you please provide me with your settings or .set file.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Default settings ( didn't touch anything except the magic number ) opened 2 charts, one for short set to true and one for long set to true on M1 chart

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Oh ok... interesting really because i am getting totally different results than you!

--- 帖子 #395 ---
There's many reasons why an EA act differently, - Internet Speed - Computer Speed - Broker ( fast execution, low spread etc. )

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Does anyone know why some orders doesn't have a SL/TP ?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
True, so what broker do you guys use (Live) i am looking forward to joining VantageFX!

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I do not have any live broker yet. But Try to find a broker that is close to your internet connection. the closer the better. or get a VPS

--- 帖子 #399 ---
if you want test the ea's all the day and night you must to use vps. i am testing some strategies and have a live account too.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
New trading day, new setup! I've understood that M1 is not the best way to trade opportunity mode with the setfiles I shared yesterday, unless you want to make your broker rich as you pay more in spread/com that you actually make. I'll hence stick to M5 today. Watch out for the upcoming news on USD and CAD this afternoon, I'll disable related pairs.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Two charts / pair ..... One large and another short set ? I cant open your zip at this moment

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi Edo, ok, that will be interessting. Plz keep us updated with the results of this day. You use these sets You posted for Fruitpunch right? Exactly these settings on every of these pairs? If yes, I would go and do some BT on some of them... Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Here you go! Remember that I use my scripts to close when I encounter missing TP issues or just that I feel like closing a cycle

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Thx Edo, do You already have an idea where the missing TP comes from? Have You checked (may be daily BT) what would have happened to those cycles You closed manually if You would not have? I remember the great goal to reach a point where we could run this as a "no minder", so this would be interessting. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I didn't really have a look at that yet, but I usually close next to the TP (sometimes I just feel like closing cycles to higher my free margin) the results wouldn't have been much different, probably better though ahah. As for the missing TP, it depends on your broker's stoplevel, I have to add a few lines in my code (i.e if TP &lt; spread + stoplevel then TP = spread + stoplevel + 5 rawpoints)

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Good Morning, Here's an update, i've let it run overnight and catch the london session. The results are TERRIBLE on M1, i do not recommend using this on M1 at all. When i woke up this morning the account was -1200$ , next week i will try on a new demo account on M5. Some transactions had no TP/SL, if i can help debugging this, most orders without TP and SL was orders made with a higher/lower lots. For example, i set the script to 0.02 .. well 0.01 or 0.04 had those missing.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Much respect to the creator of the thread, I have some nice ideas for a grid creation algo if anyone would like to hear it. Firstly, box size depends on what time frame you want to trade. Bigger box, bigger time frame and also more DD. Smaller box smaller time frame less DD. But in the time frame you are trading you have average retraces, those retraces can set your box grid. So the EA uses the market and the time frame to determine its grid size, it should also look at the volatility profile through the day, no good designing a grid bot that looks at the overnight session and basis its calculation on wrong data. Next question is the market rising or falling, better to buy in a rising market if you do sell sell at extremes, in a falling market sell and buy at extremes. Finally all trends end, so a heads up to a trend end is great to have as either the bot goes into sleep mode or ceases to trade entirely. If anyone is interested in what I am saying and you want to go grid bot designing I am willing to explore the implementation of some crucial areas.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Great results mate! Can you please share the indi for the account performance?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Alright guys, today was a bad day. I couldn't stay behind my screens to monitor the EAs so I let it run through the news and every single pair has been extremely trendy, getting my 1k demo to a 40%DD margin call. The EA was eventually able to grow the acc 10% this morning as the market wasn't that trendy Reasons why I lost: - trading way too many Pairs on a 1k account - too little leverage (100:1) got my recovery mechanism stuck at 30%DD - let the EA run through 14:30 news - let the EA run into a Friday trend environment Next episode next week, stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Edo, this EA can't handle overtrend price I think, I stuck in GBPUSD now, my DD 10%+, Let's see what will hapen

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I have the same problem.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hello Edorenta, just like I said before, we have to tune up the settings to overcome all the problems. I probably will restart my TE, cause i don't think I have the best settings, as I don't have much time, I went with the default, and I think the equity stop loss is way to tight. Just like you, I have a small account and grid systems tend to have problems in this context. Having said this, I believe you have designed one of the best and more complete EA's in FF, and as I have more time and going forward with more tests, good things might happen. Anyway, thanks for your honest post.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Id like to share how the EA has traded along the day, with news included. Attached Image Attached Image (click to enlarge) So , I think like all you, it's fundamental to determinate if we are in range or in trende, the correct set Is that is fitted to the market session. But, you know i'm a newbie

--- 帖子 #414 ---
The best EA I've found so far! Unfortunately, I was too greedy and kept the lot sizes too high and the EA running in too many pairs. I woke up this morning with my live account (that had about $500) negative :/ Lesson learned. I'm still new to the forex world (this is my first week actually putting effort to it), so I'm doing a lot of mistakes as I go. Will continue using this EA, but being more careful this time. I'm thinking about trying opportunity mode this time, with only 2 pairs. Thanks for the efforts!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
What time frame did you find it most profitable and with less risk!? I was thinking M1 or M5

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I'm still testing M5 timeframe, so I'm not the best person to answer this question for now.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
seems that you use opportunity mode at different pairs,how about in the same pair? One more thing, how about hedge every trade? Because sometime we need to wait for recovery and the price would be in a unexpected trend like Friday,Even I used the old version, I can get the close result as yours. Despite all those result, would you interested on hedge every trade? Using the same take profit formula. It can lower the DD also and keep earning even waiting for recovery. Hope you would respond for this

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Edo! As we all know that fridays in forex means by and large a "news day". News that change the market, change the trending pairs to stuck into the ranging ones, and ranging pairs to change to trending ones. Therefore, most of the senior traders don't trade on Fridays at all. That's how the market used to behave. Now, i think we should stop the EA (either manually or through built-in options) on Fridays and see the difference. What do u reckon about it? Regards.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hello Edo.Add your EA any "AOTU TREND CHANGE"- WITH H1.Then EA open orders trend direction,and filter loss orders.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yep that's something I figured the hard way looking at BT crash though, many death sentences include fridays and cycles running over the weekend so yeah, we should think about not trading after friday morning

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Been having fun with this EA. Thanks Edo. Has anyone tested the equity stop? I had mine set to 10% on one pair but it lost 17%, have not gone over the trade history to check it out yet, just asking if it is working for others and if so, what are you setting your equity stop at, if at all? Cheers

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yes, is working, but you have to test the EA, and adapt the settings to your trading environment , i.e. size off account, pairs your trading, cause the EA will make profits continuously but when a strong trend occurs the equity stop will activate and you'll lose the profits. At least this happened to me twice, in 200 pips moves with no retracement. Again, if I had the correct settings this will not happen, so the secret is to have the best set possible. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Many many thanks to for this wonderful EA. The problem of friday.... Even stopping the trading on Friday afternoon, we already have some open positions; what we do with these? perhaps you need to allow the EA to close at a loss. Always better than arriving to activate the survival mode or the equity stop. thanks to Troya7634 for the picture Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #424 ---
hi edorenta, hi guys. What do you think about hedging our chart with another one, on the same pair with different TF? And with another correlative or non-correlative pair ? Really i'm suffering a lot of problems with trends in my BT, and I don't find a solution. At the moment I am not able to configure it properly at all. Even when the grid is hitten to the correct sense, I think that we are not taking advantage of that trende

hey, can you share your set-files? Cheers

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Edo, hi all, don't really know whether You want to know it ... I also ran into the trending news on friday and was trembling waiting for the things to come. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now see my result! Attached Image (click to enlarge) I do love this magic TP calculation because it simply rewards the higher exposure with growing grids but takes short cycles nice and easy! Also I'm repeating BT without fridays. Sundays are already out because in that 1 hour over here in Germany I usually have a far to high spread to trade. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Happy to see you recovered dude. You understand how the TP works, the higher the lot increases, the closer the TP will be from the current price. hence a higher multiplier theoretically means faster recovery and not just higher exposure.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thx Edo!. Sure I understand that. It's just that most of the EA I tested so far get out with the same profit regardless whether it's been only one level or even twenty.... That was my only point here. Great EA buddy! Barlam

--- 帖子 #430 ---
hey!!!! Be careful with AUD tonight !!!

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Thanks for the hint man! As I'm currently "cleaning" my small live account from another scalper EA, this morning removed the last AUDUSD positions with some profit. Now I hope so for NZDUSD next night, as there are 3 sells and 4 pending sells on the chart. I already created a trade explorer and will share it when there is only AP 5.3 running on that account, what really looks good along the last weeks... As there seems to be less talking here these days, I want to ask a question: Could anyone proof the FFCal working in Autop (5.3)? As most of the sets seem to have it switched off, I'm really interested! Cheers Barlam

I have tested v4.2 first time on H1 chart from 2012 full to 2013 till Nov but 2013 profit is almost in break even.... anyway then i found in M5 chart it shows even better result than H1 Note: M5 chart in 1month have same amount of data bars H1 chart in full 1year Jan 2012 Performance: Profit: 1285pips Loss: 861pips Net Profit: 424pips Feb 2012 Performance: Profit: 1319pips Loss: 838pips Net Profit: 481pips I dont use any martingale (inevitable fall) &amp; I use a fixed equity stop... always remember "Stop loss is your true friend" &amp; btw I used v4.2 As I tested 2 months in M5 chart that means it has been tested 2years in H1 chart

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Dude this thread is mostly about framed martingaling ahah. The TE partially got out of the trend on the USDCAD as the price retraced as followed Sorry to see your TE burn on this USDJPY cycle Troya

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I,m getting crazy with my BT, i don't find a fitted set. I think that the principal is the direction of the grid. If we could determinate it, we would have the solution, but ..... how ????

--- 帖子 #435 ---
As I said before... Jan &amp; Feb of 2012 M5 chart BT result was total 800+ pips profits but, If I would run continuously from Jan 1 to 31 then total net pips would be only 14pips!!!! Yup &amp; Feb results would be loss The trick is - You have to stop trading after a certain time of the day... just like we do in real time trading!!!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi, may be it would be a good idea (@Edo) to add an option to stop trading after a given amount profit was made each day (like SWB Grid EA). Would that fit those need You describe? Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #437 ---
It did it !!! But by this way, my DD will arrive

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi everyone and Edo, I think the problem still the same, the period of trend and the period of ranging. I think the most specious way to solve the trending market would be the different calculation of hedging. I have an idea that similar to Remon's Grid EA. That EA will close a pair of trades one is -x and one is +x+y x is the absolute lost amount, y would be the take profit amount. You can see his part two explanation: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=583322 . It is bravo and I think this Autop EA can using the similar method to reduce the lost in trending market and faster recovery. I used a similar method to trade manually with Autop but It seems OK ( you can see it in my profile, the lost is XAGAUD, despite it). The method I use is to see the RSI touch the 30value I buy once with multiple lot (0.01 to 0.06) to hedge and cancel one sell which almost sell -50pips lower. After the cancellation, the EA will open a new sell order at a higher price and it can level up the take profit price.This method can apply into ADX mechanically. In Autop5.3, it is well developed but the most important things is: How to survive and taking profit in different Market. Auto Grid can take profit in ranging market easily. If this EA also conclude a great hedging method. It will be great in different market . Hope this would help your development Sagera, Regards!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I Edo, is there a way to increase the steps between orders? Is their a multiplier to expand this steps? Can you explain how to do this in 4.2 and 5.3 version?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi mate, it's the same in alle versions ... it is called "Step = x*TP". In 5.3 it is under "__5__" and the default value is 1.1. I think this is what You are looking for! Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thanks Barlam, I do change that in both versions, but it doesn't seem to have effect...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hmm, I think it depends on the TP calculation and so also on the Martingal multiplicator. I think You should see the difference when You reach more steps in a cycle. At least I can tell You, that it works: My BT show complete different results for 1.2 and 1.1. As I'm going to change my live account to 1.1 from 1.2 I did intense testing on that. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hey guys. The step calculation is the same as the TP calculation multiplied by the Step factor (that's why in the settings you see x*TP). That means that if the TP based on ATR/HiLo and raw pips is 20 pips and your Step factor is 1.5, your step will be 30 pips, your exposure growing slower than if you had a smaller step but a much slower recovery too.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thank's EDo, gonna try it.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi Edo, in your settings ATR/HiLo is written in points. Points or pips ? Points seems correct to me. Your 5.3 opportunity mode is doing very well, playing with different settings and I use 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I think Edo did a quick reply ... sure it's points as pips would not fit here

--- 帖子 #448 ---
2 days, current

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Yes it's expressed as raw points (i.e if you trade EU: the pair is at 1.114 which means that 1 raw pips i 1,1 pips. A raw point on the EU will be 0,1 pip. Now if you trade the USDTRY which is at 3,023 atm, a raw pip would be 3,02 pips, hence a raw point would be 0,3 pips.)

I have tired to try martingale systems..... Most popular threads are all talking about system like this.... What we need is a system with SL for every trade... martingale is like time bomb, you won for three days,he won for three weeks,someone keep longer for three month... JUST one day, ALL Dead!

--- 帖子 #458 ---
but all say that with martingale you have to close when profit and to withdraw all. if you doubl e you account and withdraw then you are right. like to play casino. win only once but not forever.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Which version of the EA are you using???

--- 帖子 #460 ---
martingale usually have little profit....cause they cut the winner short, let the lose run..... When to withdraw this is problem...only god knows

--- 帖子 #461 ---
it's about MM, spread your risks between many accounts, don't care if one blows up, withdraw every week. This my demo testing

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I didnt use martingale... I shut it off &amp; tried to test the EA &amp; it appears for the first Jan - April... 4months total 2200+ pips but May &amp; June it started to fail

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Stop hi-jacking this thread with your BS tests please. This ea is based on recovery/wager loss, if you disable the lots increase then there is nothing to be tested, this EA is meaningless used this way. Dude all the TE you put up are martingale based. Why don't you trade the way you think then? ahah

[quote=infernal199;9068644] Nothing personal dude it is just that the TP calculation is based on the scale of the positions, so your TP will always be miles away from your current cycle if you use constant lots

IMHO everyone has it's own approach to the market, and may adapt the system the way it's more convenient. Your tool is very powerful, cause it's very customizable, so we are able to change whatever it's need to suit our strategy. One question EDO, what to do if like today with NFP we have a large cycle of trades open in one way?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
If it is possible to implement control button for example STOP (CONTINUE)? Stop means that EA will continue until open orders exist.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Well if you're already in the market and not hedged, brace yourself and wait for a retracement Look at my TE, I wasn't hedged and decided to withstand the NFP, now I'm crying

Hello Edo, Sorry I quit use on Live account, I will BT again and again. mybe I cant find best sets, I want to use this EA on live account after this BT. Actually, in overtrend its too danger, please find way out for this problem thanks edo

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Yes, the problem is that the steps are to narrow, and in a strong trend the lots will multiply to fast and put the account in danger. In a ranging market it's perfect, and the profit is overwhelming, but when trending it's hard. EDO have included the hedge function to prevent this, but we still haven't found a perfect way to do it, cause when there is more than one hedge order open it will not calculate the TP correctly, and honestly I don't know if that's easy to accomplish. For now, I am tweaking settings, enlarging the steps so the system may adapt to the pair range. Euro for example is in a narrow range of +-1200 pips since January 2015. I'm trying to find the best settings so my top order size lot met the top of the range to not put the account in danger.

--- 帖子 #473 ---

My Exp how to profit use Autop 5.3 default Setting. no greedy = profit (if I use this EA in more than 3 pairs I often lose, but when I place Autop on 2-3 pairs I more often profit) avoid the news (Autop can't handle overtrend, so avoid big news) baby step (I prefer quick profit despite slightly than big profit but need too long time. I prefer M5 than M15 or 1H) Autop like the Staedy state (if we have small balance, stable market will be good for us) Sorry I'm not good in english, please 'gv me good feedback for good sets, I want to try too, thanks all thanks Edo for good EA

Nice, do you mind sharing your .set file with everyone so we can all attain all the same profits!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
please test it before start on real account. Use it on real account on your own risc. I think every EA can blown down accounts. So watch what he makes and don´t forget to withdraw your wins. Don´t worry when it will blown your account. I made a BT for myself from januar 2016 - juni 2016 with no blown result. In my zip file are 3 set files. Use the micro set if you have a micro account, the mini set for mini account and standard for standard or demo accounts. I have start with micro account and a recommended ballance around 100,00 €. This setfiles do not use martingale and have max trades 7. Good luck. Attached File(s) PaGaLeO.zip 5 KB | 1,933 downloads

Hey peoples, i do nothing. This is only a setting wich works good for about 4 weeks now and no on knows how it will wotk in the future. So be carefull. This EA is Edorentas work with help by many other members here. I hope the peoples who will run this setting with Autop 4.3 makes good results. I use the same setfile for EUR/USD for 1 Week now, the result is also ok and made profits, but USDCAD results better @this moment. Perhaps someone will test the setfile with other Pairs. Next week i will start with testing the Autop 5.3 Version. Great job Edorenta !!!

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi Troya, first i will say you do a good job here. The ADX Trend Timeframe settings was posted in the setfile from user andres. I have tested his setifle and do optimized it again. My result, if someone like me have a little ballance account it is better to reduce the max trades without using martingale because i have more control. If the ballance is much bigger so martingale can make more money. I let run only 1 ! pair each account. I think it is better to have more low ballance accounts and some of them with different pairs just like one big account with different pairs. Actually i have another real money micro account with autop4.3 , started with 40,00 bevor 1 week and EURUSD, same setfile but with max trades 4 and now its around 60,00 .

Hi troya, yes you are right. I noticed the same if ADX direction is on higher TF then account can survive much better. My ongoing 5 accounts in opportunity mode, are on M5 and ADX trend TF is set to M15. Ongoing tests on 5 demo accounts are showing nice growth and survived well 24h/day last week.

I am glad that you have detected the same. Even if for 5m chart , we use 1h, it seems to be good.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
hello, Can you share your sets I want to try, thanks

--- 帖子 #494 ---
let's see if this week my account grows to 40€ , duplicating the inicial balance. In that moment, I will stop the automated system, will withdraw 10 €, and restart my TE with a more agressive sets. Good luck !!!!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Interesting!, make sure to let me know how it goes haha and yes good luck

--- 帖子 #496 ---
any news in thead ?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
.... Working about and testing it ..... 😓😓

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I'm currently with a lot of open positions and big drawdown (about 30%) for GBPCHF, since yesterday. I'll make update about that trade if anything happens, but I don't think that will be a problem, unless a big move occurs in the opposite direction, again. The EA already grew my account 70% in 2 weeks, so I'm very happy with it Also, I'm lowering the risk as my account grows, so I don't lose it all in one bad cycle.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Can You plz share your settings? Thx

--- 帖子 #500 ---
REMEMBER !!!! My TE is only a test with a very small real account. My DD is very bad. Please be careful.

Thanks, can you upload your set-file?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
of couse sorry for my bad english. It's AP 4.3. Set copiered from PaGaLeO post all for 3000 cent account (0.1 lot/1000 cent deposit) are here: https://www.sendspace.com/file/09rf9k

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Alright... The GBPCHF cycle was closed in profit, after two and a half days in red. The profit was about 10~15% the account size. The biggest lot size was 46.20, starting in 0.1. My account had about 40% drawdown to do it. I'm thinking about lowering the starting lot even more. That was the first that that happened in this account, but it was kind of scary. Anyway, still loving the EA .

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I restarted my TE with new settings, as my account balance is small, the default settings were to aggressive. Till now, even with movements of 150 pips, the DD is quite low, and the max, was about 8%. Gonna try it some more weeks and them post here the settings. Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Barlam, What set you use in TE?

Hi, Edo I did forward test of AP5.3 for XAUUSD. The TP is more than $200 away from current price. Would you please check it? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did some backtest also. The TP is correct by using tick data. But it is not correct by not using tick data.

hello all backtesting the ea... can any1 advise me (in case i missed out on the posting)...which settings should i adjust if i use 4 digit broker and 5 digit broker? thx in advance!

--- 帖子 #512 ---
sorry for my bad English. I haven't enougt tick data but I'm afraind this set is not to good. lot multiplier 2.0 and max trades 15 are to mutch

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Yeah, i would never even consider that.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Yes, It is not the setting that I will use. I prefer to use 1.4-1.7 for different pairs. It is just to give a setting to reproduce the wrong TP. XUAUSD has 2 digits. 1336. xx ​

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi all, back again since I've been of for some days. To answer Your question Classic T, it's the same settings I posted here already but 0.02 start lot and altogether 3 charts. One trading long, one short and and long &amp; short. I just want to see what happens here. I think it is risky but may be it can double the balance quickly. Let's see what happens! I would share a TE with my live account too (0.01 and only 1 EA long &amp; short), but there is another EA in a chart and I have to wait until the last cycle (bad, bad cycle) closes there... Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #516 ---
i just tried it on a live account with micro lot. now i get the error divided by 0. any idea, what might be the reason? Cheers

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi, we could check Your settings if You share it together with the pair You try to use it on...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Ok, xcool asked me to post those set files from my actual demo TE linked to the thread. Here they are, exactly like they are running in that demo acc... All running on EURUSD M1. As it was no good idea to post them exactly like running, I removed the sets here and reposted them in a later post. The sets here did use general settings to only allow long or short and not the config of the EA itself. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #519 ---
@Barlam thank you very mutch ( vielen,vielen Dank )

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi Barlam, in all three set files are the long and short cycle enabled. Just ask, because one should trade long the other short and the third in both way. Regards

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I checked this and dammit You are right. I in fact did use the general EA setting to only allow short or long! Of cause this does the same as I don't use the hedge features. Nevertheless please find the correct settings attached here. (I'll remove the other archive on my former post). Cheers Barlam

Hello PaGaLeO, Sir, Thank you for your set files and concerned advice. It was very informative and easy to understand. My demo account is wonderfully doing well but not the live one. I am enclosing the screen shots here-under. Please suggest changes in settings to operate it on my live account at your convenience. Thank you with Regards, kkb2k8

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi, I would like to ask what is the different between TE attached in this thread? thanks

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hello PaGaLeO, Sir, Extremely sorry Sir, the live account has started making trades with your mini account setup. I was repeatedly using the micro account setup as I am having very low equity &amp; was afraid to use the mini. I apologies to FF and all concerned for occupying space in the thread. I thank you again for being successful by your support file and I Salute &amp; thank to Forex Factory for providing us such an platform. Regards, Sir, kkb2k8

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Ok, as we can see in my TE those settings are to risky, at least using this set on three EAs on the same chart... I will remove the TE set up a new one when I have the time ... more conservative this time. Update: Ok this trendy movement in EURUSD is going to kill even my live account.... So I have to wait and see what's going to happen. Info: The EA has been in SELL on EURUSD on M1 since 2:20 am without any considerable retracement until news on 2:30 pm today (look at the chart). Update: Yes it started to kill my live account and I did something I never wanted to do again - I threw some more money on the problem and... Got a trade out on (only) one open position. In the end I managed to get out of this hell with some profit. BUT: This has only been luck and experience from former pain back when I already burned my fingers (and money of cause) in the past! Conclusion - we have to use at least the equity stop, may be somewhere above the trade out level (30% with my account). Why I'm telling You this story? I will adjust my sets, repeat many of my BT and get back here with the results, may be along with some new TE. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Another great day for my account! 5.8% profit already, today. The big profit was made in USDJPY, starting with 0.1 micro lot and closing in 19.23 micro lots (which is not a problem... my account can survive much more). The low risk / small lots setup is working great. There are days that the profit is not so good, but in compensation, my account does not blow up and generate great returns in days where the market is volatile / trendy. Thanks again for this awesome EA.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
can you post your setfiles? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Live Acc?, and if yes what's youe equity! Because if it's under $1K then that lot size is very risky.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
It's a live micro-account. The equity is about 1.2k. Sure. I attached the set files, but keep in mind that you have to adjust it to your own equity and to the risk you want to take. I'm using that same set for 3 weeks now. I trade EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPCHF and AUDNZD.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Nice and thanks!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi Danielfariat, thanks for sharing the set file, may i know what time frame you use for it?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hello PaGaLeO, do run your TE on H4? Can you please attach your settings please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I'm using M5.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
@Eng.JMD Fuck, it's so easy to go some pages back, isn't it ? You must at least be able to do this damn simple job ! Right ? So at page 24 - post #480 - he posted his settings !!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I saw it. But in description of TE is mention H4 not m1 I want to confirm this. And also need to confirm the set also since there was another TE and it blown out. However, the question was for PaGrloe not for you. And you suppose not to answer, we are here to learn what missing in our trade. Thanks

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I doubt whether we would achieve the same result because of the starting time, the version, the spread, the timeframe, etc. This all is a big question mark.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
...note, Berliners are always well-known for a cheeky snout...

--- 帖子 #541 ---
This morning I started to test PaGrloe's set-file (according post #480) on AP_4.3 on 1min on EU. In the meantime I have already more trades then he displays above. I don't understand.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Would you make a TE or post your investor password? Maybe we can compare the two accounts. A difference could be the different start time.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I have no TE. I'm trying live and what I mentioned before it will never ever the same result as PaGrloe has.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
What he has posted is set file for USDCAD. He might use different setting for EURUSD. He should have a trend filter on high TF to get such a result.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Actually that's what i mean. As long as we do not get exact information about all the details of his settings etc. we will not be able to copy his results. PaGrloe's settings are still a black box for me.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
1 minute is doing so well for me!!! I hope it sustains and proves itself so i can run it on a LIVE acount. It is currently at 63 Wins and 7 Losses

--- 帖子 #547 ---
This sounds great! You have any idea how to reach your incredible result? :-)

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thank you for this great EA. ​ I´ve run many backtest and what came to my mind is: Is it possible for future update to let the EA Close trades when the amount of Floating Chart P&amp;L reach a specific amount of Money. There were some situations in which the Money went above $50 but neither trades were opened or closed. After a day the Floating Chart P&amp;L went to -$300 I think it could help to understand the EA better in some currencies. Nevertheless, thank also to everyone in order for helping. (sorry for my bad grammar)

--- 帖子 #549 ---
You hit the nail on the head. I have been running this (5.3) all week on just the default settings and I have a global trade manager that set's the equity target at 10% a day, then it flattens all the trades and I am done for the day. It has hit 10% every day so far this week. The only thing I am working on is trying to get the DD under control as it is around 24% If you are wondering E/U, U/J, G/U, CHF/JPY, EUR/GBP, E/J and G/J 15 minute charts

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Wich options do you set to have that equity target? Only equity target (true) and 10% ? I tested it a few weeks ago and couldn't

--- 帖子 #551 ---
The pairs/assets I'm trading are in my post, 15 minute time frame. Yes... Equity has to hit 10 percent then my global EA will flatten any open positions. My balance is about 25 percent above my equity. The next day I adjust my lot size to 3 percent risk of the new balance. This week might be an outlier.... I've only ran it this week. I'll continue to run it for the next couple weeks to see if this trend continues. When/if I go live I will probably lower my profit target to 5 percent daily. Hopefully this answers your question

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Sorry, when you say "my global EA" , what are you speaking about? Autop 5.3 or another thing ?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I have an EA that monitors my account and stops trading when the equity reaches the levels I want. Which in this case is 10 percent. Otherwise the EA (5.3) will just run unabated.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
We really need some kind of stop loss mangement or trailing as i've noriced when the markets move very quickly in price the ea will not be able to get back to its original position = BIG LOSS!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thanks. Understood

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I started live a live account on eur/usd M5 with 2 charts, one long and one short. However after several days the ea's only opens one trade each side so I ended having almost same equity with a huge distance between the buy and sell order.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi everyone, I'm truly sorry I didn't give you guys any news lately. I found out coming back from holidays that the flat I used to rent in Paris had burnt down and so did my source code.... I know you might not believe it but that's a true story. I got extremely upset and had to reconsider my priorities as I was getting a new job in the meantime. Forex is my soulmate and I'll get back to it really soon, with an even better EA, and a cleaner strategy. Until this time comes, please do not send me any more PM on Autop as I discontinued my dev on the version 5.4 that unfortunately is no more. I see that many of you guys are actually making money with my EA and I'm very happy about it. Please continue sharing sets and results on here, I'll be watching you It was great working along with you on this and that taught me a lot too. Cheers friends

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Thanks for all your hard work Edo, sorry to hear of your loss of the source code. Look forward to seeing you back sometime. Take it easy. Cheers.

Hi everyone. I hope someone can help me here. I am using version 5.3 with long settings on the one chart and short settings on the other. At the moment the trades work like this. If long close on the one chart, short immediately open on the other chart as if they are link together.(i did change the magic numbers). I want the charts to act seperately. What i mean is if a long trade is open on the one chart but start to move in a down cycle, i want the other chart to open a short. It must not wait for the long trade to close before it opens. Thanks

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hi, now that is quite strange, because it should (and does) really work like You want it to. You are sure, that You are using different magic numbers? @troya: Like in my PM I will try to explain those settings when I find some time to do this... Cheers Barlam

Hi Barlam. Yes i am sure about the magic numbers, but does not matter. I just put long and short on one chart. Works OK for me. I just want to make sure about the type of MA i must use. In all the set files posted here it shows "0" but in the 5.3 version i have there is not a "0" option only smooth, linear weighted etc. The default setting is LWMA but i dont know if that is correct? Thanks for your help.

hello sir what is your input in both cases

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I started with a 500usd account and the EA still going on. It's not a perfect example, but as others on this thread, if you use the right settings, i.e, use a very conservative approach with a grid not to tight, pay attention to news events. It works with no problem.

Hoi, great EA! I have an idea, how can it works better. I Use UniversalStrenghtMeter since 1 year, and it works fine for me. I use 2 of them, one on H1 and one on H4 both with MACD standard settings. When H1 H4 are in same direction I trade as trend, When H1 is in oposite direction I trade as countertrand. It is possible to run only sell/buy cyrcle in the direction of the trend/countertrend, and run sell+buy cyrcle when the market is in sideway. There is a short video about the USM, the indicator what I attached is a little different, because it is a free version. Inserted Video

Dear friends, I wanted to test Opportunity Mode and I DID by running two instances of the EA on two charts of the same pair (EURUSD) , one with Long Cycles disabled, the other with Short Cycles disabled, and using the one-sided trend filter on both. I did all the writings, But the problem is: both EA open orders same time and same position! Do not they have to be different? I attached running same time my both EA settings. Where am i doing wrong in ea's settings? Please help me! Thank you... P.S 1: I change both ea "Magic Number" and "Hegge Trades Magic Numbes." P.S 2: What is "Survival Mode?

Great idea! Can't wait to see its outcome

Look closer. The left side only sells whereas the right one only buys. The order levels appear on both chart as this is the way MT4 works but the EA is working correctly

Nice to see you back Edorenta New projects?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi there, I'm working on it, stay tuned

--- 帖子 #601 ---
After three months DEMO, i finally found the right way to use martingale systems. They are: 1 trade on lower TF, better not trade Higher than M15 in order to survive in massive NEWS flow. 2 trade on both directions, let the profit run in one side and try to break even in another side. 3 trade patient and not greedy, hands off on those red Schedule pairs or those pairs already have crazy moves. 4 trade with good brokers which provide tight spreads even during big NEWs time. Finally, the most important of all...have faith in martingale systems, if there is a rise there must be a fall, visversa.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hello jonirrenicus, there is definitely some merit in grid/averaging/scaling/martingale systems, even if most of the ceptic people on FF, just close their eyes and ears when marti word is pronounced. Beside all the points that you listed I add money management as the most important. If you calculate the maximum lot based on the maximum range for a pair, and I'm saying this based on monthly timeframes, the account will never blown, if using hedge, obviously. The only issue I'm dealing at the moment is one that you've pointed out, and that is greed and anxiety, mainly to winning positions, cause we are always afraid of this coming negative and close them to soon. To prevent this I'm trying to using automated systems, but even then there is always the temptation of closing the orders manually . Anyway, good luck to all, and with the help of Edorenta that I consider one of the best coders in FF, and with his new concepts, we will always come up with better ideas and better EA's.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I will wait, thanks

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi lads, this week-end I'll be pleased to introduce you to my new creation: Keops. The core idea is similar, but the code is much cleaner and beyond customisable. The EA will fit better small accounts too.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Thanks EDO, as always, thanks for sharing. Can't wait to test it. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Bravo EDO!!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
If you calculate the maximum lot based on the maximum range for a pair, and I'm saying this based on monthly timeframes, the account will never blown, I have to point this out....this is very wrong my friend. I'm trying to using automated systems, but even then there is always the temptation of closing the orders manually . Look at this, why you have to close orders? Because you have to stop trading ranging before NFP/Bid rate...etc. My experience tells, " The longer you stay in this market the more dangerous you are!" Need proof? here you are... A good ranging system has to be"quick in &amp; out "

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi Edo, happy to see You back on track! You know I am here to support where ever I can... Got a new Xeon Server ready for testing. Your EA will be prio one. So let there be maaaaany tests and create something even more impressive. I am still sure automation can be done Your way. So keep up Your great work! Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #609 ---
good ideas. not sure if trading both direction is right. i would like to add something else: time in trade is critical. the less time spent in position(s) when a marti involved, the less the exposure to moves, the better. another, pick staring point. smarter. not any random point. marti thrive on mean reversal. help having a meaningful one way move based on whatever the preference, simple visual, indicator, currency strength, etc. previous x days or x hours move can help. average daily range too. many mentioned above combined can give high(er) probability. there is no fool proof in marti. traditional, or soft approach, like not full doubling down, just the same. i believe time in trade is the ingredients that makes the difference. trying to be selective, pick initial entry smart, and be out reasonable fast with reasonable profit. the more time in trade expand, the more invalid the initial entry idea become, the more the chance of ruining account.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Yes Yes, we have a lot in common.... Trading both sides is the only way to increase profit for martingale system... If you have a better idea, i'm very glad to hear... i believe time in trade is the ingredients that makes the difference. trying to be selective, pick initial entry smart, and be out reasonable fast with reasonable profit. Exactly! it takes me 3 three months to understand this point, that's why i pick lower TF to avoid NEWS release and start trading only at S/R lvls.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
my experience... still not sure about running both side i am a firm believer that once in a trade focus all the concentration and monetary resources to that one trade / one set of entries. news are not to avoid, simple wait for the first 2-5 min to a new range to establish, then fade the direction with marti. S/R, and i believe pivot levels ( not really beyond daily if M5 chart used!) and BRNs (00) also useful. there is no fool proof approach of course. at major news like election, brexit vote, better to be away from temptation of trading! as for money management, after the initial growth of account it will become key part to withdraw to the side at least part of the profit. as account equity grows, position sizing if not 100% following the growth, can also become extra cushion to drawdown, lowering risk somewhat. here is my "project" i am working on, when time allows, adjusted some things as per above from a bad drawdown after february. ( trading is not continuos, due my everyday work). the data i left in shows what i meant lower the time in trade. the rest of the data not shown, irrelevant here on the topic. since february there was no losing day. currently after 300+ trades average trade duration is 21 min. it is average, so, some ends in 1 min, some in 2 hours, obviously. martingale meets scalping?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
sorry, forgot one important thing to mention... we talking about martingale here, but for the record, single entries not only fine, but welcome! basicly, marti is used to enhance otherwise sound enough trade entries, where timing might be a bit off for some reason. and of course, the trade off, the less is time in trade, the less the risk because in a trade, but as a trade off often money is left on the table. believe that a worthy compromise to make.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Thank you for your contribution on trades duration. However, could you tell me what exactly this has to do with the EA? You're talking about single entries, the ea is about scale-in entries. I'm impressed by your trade journal and I'd be curious to know more about the exact way you scalp and what is you analysis based on. Maybe you should start your own thread and tell us more about it Cheers

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Push! @profitfarmer: sounds and looks really interesting. May be You would like to share Your insights and get feedback (ignoring all troll comments witchout any value of cause). Keep going...

--- 帖子 #615 ---
uhm, here is a little clarification then, since previous posts were not about me or how i trade, but was intended as part an answer to the post above about time in trade. and that can relate to the EA. mention single trade entries. that stands in context of the marti scale in. to elaborate. once the timeframe where entries considered lowered, then in turn preferable the marti scale in distances should be lowered too...that in turn might result that about 20-40% of the time a tighter TP will be hit without ever needing/happening a scale in. this fact itself also lowers the 'time in trade' as well. also points to that in general vs. any random entry point, an entry based on some thing or things might enhance probability to a good entry ( some single entries) and that in turn reinforce the chance that other trades based on the sort of higher probability entry points might just as well has a better chance to come out ahead and faster than any random point marti entry. results in lower consecutive number of marti entries, lower running drawdown, quicker possible recovery and exit, and yes, less time in trade, so, more focus and cash to be available for another trade when comes around. higher the timeframe, larger the pacing, more time in trade, and more chance that the initial entry situation have changed, or an important news to happen. hope clarify a bit what i wanted to write. i dont trade with EA, manual trading, but indeed it is based on a hybrid soft/traditional martingale approach, on M5 tf. if you dont find it related, then sorry, was not intended to spam your thread.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Man, i think you got it very wrong! THIS IS Edorenta's thread! Calling him the troll is very silly!! i am only thought to add some of my thoughts, since i trade a somewhat similar way, although manually.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Wow, now You got me very wrong. I would never call edo a troll. I mean, there are always posts sending all martingal to grave... I'm a supporter of edo's work since I'm here on FF (he knows that ). I'm sorry if my statement was'nt clear... I just wanted to push his idea to make You talk about Your work with us - may be in an own thead. Cheers, Barlam

--- 帖子 #618 ---
ok. if there is no feel that it derails the thread, and there is some questions about what i wrote, it is fine with me to try to answer if i can. if i could add something to the thread, great. as i said, i have zero knowledge about EA and programming. my experience is in manual martingale trading.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Now You are on the way. The hack &amp; what Edo is trying to do here is, to use his knowledge and also what You obviously can contribute (as perhaps everyone else here on the thread) to automate that trading (as far as possible without getting to complicated - as this mostly seems to fail in the long term). I still think it can be done &amp; Edo is someone able to do it - as You and me are not! From my experience every input and feedback is welcome to Edo. @Edo: Correct me if I tell something wrong as it might look like I'm talking for You (what also was not my intention at all). Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi Edo, nice to see you again. You making great job and can't wait your next EA. I still trying to ajust Autop v5.3 with (think ) good results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is only November. TF is M5 but i must control EA all the time. I was very close to the clear account. Deposit is in PLN (about 0,25$), both direction L&amp;S. @Barlam: thanks for the sets and tests. Guys you are amazing. Many thanks ----------- sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #621 ---
OK, here is an example. ( i made it easier to see by presenting M1 chart, i basically use M5). having fully in trade and waiting vs. reduced time in trade. less steps used thus lower DD% running, when in trade. this for start. if not deemed off topic, we can continue, but like to here also some views in exchange.

--- 帖子 #622 ---

Hi guys, I dont know if I this question is suitable for this thread, but I will try. Because if I dont ask answer is still no. I see you r working on something similiar as me. So I need help with margin formula with multiple trades when Im buying/ selling, just averaging my entry level. USDCAD Price l volume l margin 1. buy at 1.3510 0,01 ? 2. buy at 1.3520 0,01 3. buy at 1.3530 0,02 4. buy at 1.3550 0,03 5. buy at 1.3570 0,05 Do you know how to count formula from some weighted average after this move and rising volume. I need to put in my excel. Thank you

hi all i would like to thank first edorenta for giving everyone his work. after metaquotes have told they will shutdown mt4 i like to know what will happen if we have to migrate to mt5 .this ex4 file will not work all our demo efforts will go in vain. any idea when will mt4 shutdown.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
in a way your demo effort was/is always vain! the least your forward demo test, but most ppl seem to be busy to try to again and again over-optimize backtests, to the point it becomes very unlikely to run on present/future data with similar results. not to mention that real life slippage ( and for example few cases when broker in demo use their best volume discount) just not reflected as in live account. i think after few backtest, the best is at least to go forward with the EA, like the one linked to the thread. i think that better testimony for the EA than any optimized backtest ever be!! of course, each needs to decide that stat data is something they can deal with ( DD%, PF, W%, etc)

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Thank u . i do accept everything you told. but my worry is after we put all efforts if we are forced to shift to MT5 due to closure of mt4 WILL WE BE ABLE TO USE THE EA in MT5?

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Don't worry, Edorenta will still be here for us. Even if it's not in this project, will be another even better.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
NICE TO HEAR THAT. We all will be happy if EDORENTA THE BOSS himself will assure us that. i know it is too much of ask but he is the leader.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
only one thing comes into my mind: Man, you, after 6 years on FF forum still make so much fuss about starting a backtest, i feel you need not worry about MT5 coming...by the time you get to live trading it will be already MT8 implemented anyway

--- 帖子 #632 ---
hi, what makes u think i made fuss about starting backtest. u missunderstood my frist quote i had only told about demo will go waste if we cant migrate to MT5. i was surprised by your answer. anyway the APT answer was only from kornrogers. he understood what i meant. i do not believe in back test frankly it is pain to do backtest in MT4. I TRIED OPTIMISATION few times but failed so i do only forward testing. and i do only forward demo and i try it live first in cent accounts and then to standard account. but i liked your comment that even MT8 will be implemented . i liked that.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
may misunderstood... yet, i think whatever effort you put in testing is not vain, as long as it is forward. i would say better to risk your 20$ right away for a cent account, than end up finding out that the system is working sufficient to realize you wasted 6 months on demo. and even after the demo there is never a guarantee that things will work live. once i had that experience with a system of mine. worked on backtest, worked similar on demo forward...then just died out on live trading, as market range changed some, and slippage was eating a few pips a day, just enough to ruin my cost. good system, acceptable MM with R:R 1.5, but all the time felt wasted...should i figure out in the 6 months demo what i learnt in 1 month live...yep, that would worth 20 or 100$. after all time spent has a value too, just as well as you dont work at your job free neither. ( and i am not!).

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I accept it. nothing is equal to live and most important enemy which we will face is our EMOTION which will never be seen in demo.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi all, ok, I know it might be a stupid newbie question, but I just have to ask... I did a BT on EURUSD from 1.1.2014 to 1.10.2016 SHORT only with 10k balance and it was quit good with less than 20% DD and nice profit. It took more than 250 hours on a small Xeon Server I will provide the results when confirmed. Perhaps I want to go SHORT only because of positive swaps (EUR as margin currency). To be sure that this acceptable DD is not only result of the downtrend in this period I'm now testing LONG only in the same period with the same settings. I limited the number of grid cycle positions to 10 and in the very beginning of 2014 (02.01.2014) the 10 levels were taken comming back in TP in the end of the month (24.01.2014). Now my question: The TP was taken, but altogether the balance was about 40 EUR less than before. Is that because the negative swaps are calculated in the BT? (Would be no problem at all if the DD is OK. I will see that in the test results). Thx in advance for any reply... Cheers Barlam

Is anyone using still this EA especially on live accounts? It seems very slow for optimizing. Author seems to moved to another project so I guess this one wont be developed any longer? Thanks

--- 帖子 #650 ---
hi Edorenta i know its not the right place to post.but u must see it. i have found this ea on youtube. its extremely profitable with low draw down. with PRO version 80 to 100% profit per month.but he gave u the free real version of this ea with limitations like no backtest ,after two weaks it dont work. i can not understand which indicator is used to open 2nd,3rd and onward positions to martingale . you can have this version just ask him in youtube comments. please make this ea i have tested all three versions on demo account. and its a good martingale ea .because if there is a news which moves in one direction like 200 or 300 pips it dont open next position untill his indicator give the signal. thats why low drawdown.

Hi Edorenta and all, Have you got any trouble with FFcal indicator? Today I got trouble it. It can not load and make MT4 freezed Please help me to solve this Can this ea trade without load this indicator? Thanks alot

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi Mmfx15, it might help You to know, that the FFCal implementation sadly does not work in Autop. So I guess if You remove the indicator and siable it everything should be ok. If it is activated or loaded (here Edo has to jump in) Your Expert log will be flooded with log entries that the indicator can not be loaded. I guess if You set "Use FFCal" to false, you should have no problems. I just can't verify that at the moment... Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Thanks Barlam, I removed it. It works now

hi edo, i tried to trade with your autop ver.5.3 but find some trouble about the local broker rule that limit minimal open order is 0.1 and five digits broker.can you helpme with the right set? Â Â thank's

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi there, after much personal problems i am back now. I am still working with this EA and write you about my results. I have still run the autop 4.3 version with EUR/USD now. In the last 6 Month i have made round about 260% profit with live-account. Also i have withdraw money. I do not let him run all the times in automatic mode. Sometimes i stop him Fridays in different times when i have positiv results, also today. So, the autop 4.3 can be a realy best, sometimes he made till 20,00 profit a day with only a 50-70 € equipy account, but sometimes, when the news are bad, he went till 25,00 negativ. I will say that can be often. this result, the drawdorn van be till 55% sometimes, but all the time i have wait about 1-3 days, mostly i gave him a chance to come back to positiv result. The The last time was wednesday. All looks goods, bad news, he went the wrong way about 60 - 80 pips and i have wait. This night ( german timezone ) he comes back to winning zone. All good. In the past i have stop bad results 2 or 3 times manualy with lost and some days later i saw that i have only to wait because he comes back in winning zone. I think, the autop is a very good semi automatic EA, you have watch 1.2 days what happend. You must look, what is the best way yourselfe. I am still happy with this EA because i have good feelings about it. My little live account makes good profits. Some post bevor i have upload my set with USD/CAD. I do not change something and i use this set with EUR/USA . But be carefull. Never let him run without control- Best regards to all and good trading sessions. PaGaLeO

hiÂ PaGaLeO, can you help me with the set file ? our local broker have rule about minum open order is 0.1 not 0.01 . thank's

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I hope i can help you. Which account do you have? Mini or Standart Account? In Page 27 i have post a zip file with 3 setfiles. Use the micro lot setfile if you have a micro account, use the mini setfile if you have a mini lot account and use the last one if you have a standart lot account. This are Setfiles for autop 4.3. I use EUR/USD. You can test him bevor also with USD/CAD When you load one of these setfiles best you change the max trades from 7 to 4 if your account ballance is under 75 Dollar. I only use 4 max trades. Whatever. Autop will open till 5 position then.

the set file is for one chart trading or we can use two chart with same currencies to hedg?

PAGALEO good day, I tested your EA works very well, I should please a few questions. I tried your publication set 0.01 set based on the ideal 1000usd account, max drop about 600usd, you have some in conservative settings? As Alternatively, change the value of TP can decrease the period ATR? I am sorry for my bad English

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi jkos, the EA is from Edorenta, i made only the setfile post here. Actually i search for a conservative setting for it. regards.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Thanks for your answer, you use the settings with a SL? of the graph have such declines?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi, no, i don´t use stop loss inside the EA. I wrote on page 33 that i use him like a semi pofessional EA. I stop him sometimes, not often myself, if i have the feeling the ea went to much in wrong direktion.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hello all I have been following this thread for a time and i like the idea but do someone have the mq4 file of autop v5.3. Important think with this ea is to stop trading and maybe place hedge orders when high impact news is coming on the traded currencies. another think we have to understand exactly when and how is this ea is placing trades so if we want some improvment that we know what all this opitons or parameters are. We dont need big changes but there are small fixes that have to be done . I m not a coder bother way but here are people that following this ea that can code. but we need the mq4 file first

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Sir question can i use ur system to my live micro account? I have $100 with min. lot sized of 0.01 Please advice me thank you very much your highnest

@PaGaLeO Are you using your USDCAD set file for all the pairs I see in your Trade Explorer?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
not actually. I use it with EURUSD

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Yes you can, i have micro account also with setting 0.4 Lot and max trades 4. Actually i don´t run this because i test a new setting with lower risk settings on H1 Timeframe with different pairs. I will share it soon.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I tested new settings from January 2016 till January 2017 with EUR/USD and from 07.2016 till 01.2017 with AUD/CHF to get lower risk with Autop4.3 Version with Micro Account. So i have optimized the setfile to let him run with 1H Timeframe. All Results and Settings you will find in Zip File. My goal was to find a EUR/USD setting that even surpassed the Brexit of 20/21 June. My results and the html setfiles you find in the zip file. As always, be careful. Sometimes it takes time until he gets into the profit zone and makes profits. But you are on the safer side than the 1 minute Timeframe Setfile I posted. The 1 minute setting is more profitable, but you have to be careful. For all those who attach more importance to safety take the H1 setting. You can test the H1 settings with other couples and post good results here. It always takes a lot of time to test, but in the group we are stronger.

Hi. Can you share r set file please! Tnx

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hi, First of all, great work with this EA and it's a pity what happened to the source code. Hope we can see more of your robots coming out soon keep us updated. Does anyone know if there is a way to calculate the movements in PIPs without retracing to blow an account with X capital? For example: "Using these settings ......... would be necessary a 400 PIP movement without retracing for a $5000 account." Is there a way to calculate that for different account sizes and EA settings? It seems like a profitable EA, what I'm trying to do is see what it would take for this EA to survive past trends that didn't retrace quickly. Let's say, for instance, a $50.000 account would survive any price variation in the past 10 years, regardless to when it started or compound profit. I know about Renko charts but I need some sort of formula that takes into account all trades open and the lot size of these trades. Hope it all makes sense.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hello there, I understand what you are saying, you have to calculate the total range for the pair you want to use, let say 8000 pips in eur/usd(0,8-1,6). Then you have to divide your account amount to know how much does it cost a pip. Then define the max lot value so the account don't blow out, and then you have to know with the settings you are using what is the grid each size step, and then adapt the setting to suit the lot size. The steps above are doable, but not easy. One thing I know for sure, if you use this EA in larger timeframes (4h and above), it's very difficult for your account to blow cause it will only open an order after a candle closes, so if you have 100 pips movement in 4h it will only open another order when the 4h candle closes. Good luck.

Running v5.3 on a real $500 account Hi guys, after backtesting it, running it on demo accounts for weeks i finally moved v5.3 to a real $500,- account My plan is to double my account , so from $500-&gt;$1000 and withdraw $500 when it reaches $1000. Its running 24/7 now for 3 days and so far so good, it made $21 during those first 3 days. Before i moved to a real account i did a lot of backtesting. I had a hard time finding settings where the EA was able to double my money without blowing up the account. What i found was : 1) You really really need backtesting with 99.9% modelling quality, variable spread and commissions to get results which are (almost) the same as on live (demo) accounts. I used https://eareview.net/tick-data-suite for this 2) You need to backtest with the amount of money your real account will have. You cannot backtest with $50.000 and then put the EA in a $500 account and expect the same results. If you have a real account of $500 then do your backtesting with $500 as well 3) This EA needs capital to work with. $500 is not much so i only put it on 1 chart. Don't expect it to survive when running on 2 or more charts with just $500. This will blow up you account sooner or later 4) The lower the spread, the more profit.. thats why i choose EURUSD as it has the lowest spread (timeframe i use is M15) 5) To get the EA to survive during backtests, i had to change the following settings: - ADX trend timeframe: 1 day - trade start time : 08:00 - trade end time : 19:00 - trade on sunday: false - Max number of trades: 6 - Use equity stop: false - with these settings i backtested multiple periods during 2015-2017 where each period was 3 months and all survived and at least doubled my account. Attached are my settings.. Note: i've just started this on a live account. Results are looking good, but no guarantees off course. I'll post updates here if people are interested

Thanks for the long period of tests. May I like to ask about the DD you have faced on the long term BT's. This would be informative to adjust a lot size upon different balance types in use. It seems like I do understand from your words, that on 500 balance 2 charts will blow account in any time of long term. So a 1 chart will harm around 250 in basic words, hm am I correct of my thoughts? I did not test this for the moment but your tests inspire me some to thinking about. And did you also make some tests from other pairs beside EU, I have a mind to test it on a cent acc with more pairs to find out actual performance capacity because. Thank you for your help in advance.

Remember.. my goal is to double my $500 account into a $1000. When it reaches $1000 i will withdraw the $500 profit and start all over again. So my goal is not to let this thing run for 3 years ;-) Its double my money, take profit and then restart With my backtests the EA was able to do this within 2-3 months. So all backtests i've done are based on 3-months periods The drawdown during those 3 months periods was pretty high and i spend a lot of time searching for settings which are 'safe' and did not blow up the account. Still the drawdown with these settings can reach up to $300,- I realize this is very high (60%), but then again.. i think it is normal to have a high drawdown if your account only has $500,- Anyway.. the EA did survive and double my account in all backtests i did. I tried different starting dates between 2015-2017 and with these settings it always doubled the account in 2-3 months. I did not yet backtest any other pairs beside EURUSD. But when my first real test succeeds i plan todo so. If all goes well i will open multiple $500 accounts and let the EA run on each account on 1 chart / pair So for example account #1 : $500 EURUSD account #2 : $500 USDJPY account #3 : $500 GBPUSD etc...

Thank you much. I have a silly question. I have higher amount of balance to trade, so I need to multiple the lotsize accordingly to fit your same settings. But on BT I have not the same result if I change the lot sizes only. In example I want to trade 5 times with higher lot size of yours. Below a part of your settings and a 5 times increased lot size of mine. But on BT example with yours I get 40 trades, and with mine 57, apart from this the final result is a bit different as well. May I have to change few other parameters. Thank you in advance if you have any opinion which can help Attached Image Attached Image

State after running 5.3 on 4 charts for 1 week on a demo account with a fixed lotsize of 0.02 Total profit in 1 week: 216,- euro It was pretty smooth sailing all week long, until yesterday. Then some currencies went up 50-80 pips At the moment its trying to recover from a potential loss of -223 euros. I will just let it run to see if it will recover or not, and if it does to determine how much drawdown it used I also have 5.3 running on a $500 live account since 4 days. Since its a small account i changed the lotsize to 0.01 and it runs on just 1 chart (EURUSD) Total profit so far is 28,50 euro in 4 days with a drawdown of -4,19 euro.. So live version is doing well, and if it continues to do so, i'll start adding more $500 accounts with other currency pairs

[quote = ebeckers; 10498211] Runter mit v5.3 auf einem echten $ 500-Konto Hallo Leute, nach dem Backtesting, läuft es seit Wochen auf Demokonten und ich habe schließlich v5.3 auf ein echtes $ 500, - Konto verschoben. Mein Plan ist, mein Konto zu verdoppeln , also von 500 $ -&gt; 1000 $ und 500 $ abheben, wenn es 1000 $ erreicht. Es läuft jetzt 24/7 jetzt für 3 Tage und so weit so gut, es machte $ 21 während dieser ersten 3 Tage. Bevor ich zu einem echten Account wechselte, habe ich viel Backtesting gemacht. Es fiel mir schwer, Einstellungen zu finden, bei denen der EA mein Geld verdoppeln konnte, ohne den Account zu sprengen. Was ich gefunden habe, war: 1) Du brauchst wirklich Backtesting mit 99,9% Modeling-Qualität, variablem Spread und Provisionen, um Ergebnisse zu erhalten, die (fast) die gleichen sind wie auf Live (Demo) Accounts. Ich habe https://eareview.net/tick-data-suite benutzt 2) Sie müssen mit dem Geldbetrag, den Ihr Echtgeldkonto hat, einen Backtest durchführen. Sie können nicht mit 50.000 $ Backtests und dann den EA in einem $ 500-Konto und erwarten die gleichen Ergebnisse. Wenn Sie ein echtes Konto von $ 500 haben, dann machen Sie auch Ihr Backtesting mit $ 500. 3) Dieser EA benötigt Kapital, um damit zu arbeiten. $ 500 ist nicht viel, also lege ich es nur auf 1 Diagramm. Erwarte nicht, dass es überleben wird, wenn du mit nur 500 $ auf 2 oder mehr Charts spielst. Dies wird dein Konto früher oder später sprengen. 4) Je niedriger der Spread, desto mehr Profit. Deshalb wähle ich EURUSD, da es den niedrigsten Spread hat (Zeitrahmen, den ich benutze ist M15). 5) Um den EA beim Backtests zu überleben, Ich musste die folgenden Einstellungen ändern: - ADX-Trend-Zeitrahmen: 1 Tag - Handelsbeginn: 08:00 - Handelsschluss: 19:00 - Handel am Sonntag: falsch - Maximale Anzahl an Trades: 6 - Verwenden Sie Equity Stop: false - mit diesen Einstellungen habe ich im Zeitraum 2015-2017 mehrere Zeiträume getestet, wobei jeder Zeitraum 3 Monate betrug und alle überlebten und mein Konto mindestens verdoppelte. Anbei sind meine Einstellungen. Hinweis: Ich habe gerade mit einem Live-Konto begonnen. Die Ergebnisse sehen gut aus, aber natürlich keine Garantie. Ich werde hier Updates veröffentlichen, wenn Leute interessiert sind {Datei} [/ quote] Good Job Mate

Thanks first PaGaLeo for sharing it with us. A little my background: I'm a GRID trading fan and know its good sides and risks. Generally, I do not believe in EAs. I have tested hundreds of them and have not found what produces profits over a longer period of time. I trade manually or with special grid EA. I've been testing Autop EA 5.3 it now with Tickstory for about 1 month (ca 75 tests), partly running a demo account, and one 1H combination is also live. I have achieved profitable results and I believe in it The most reliable results are 4H. The smaller the timeline (from 1H up to 5m), the higher the risk of death traps, however, but the more profitable. I planned to start the 4H combinations first, and proceed with a profit of 1H, 15m and 5m. The best and most reliable results are given by settings such as: ADX sharpen, ADX 13/13, Both sides, no hedge and no risk, Scale-in and so on. According to the settings and test results, I still feel EA lacking in one of the settings that I plan to monitor and do manually in order to get a bigger profit and not to let the account down. I monitor one step on a larger chart the trend (Exemple: trading 1H, monitor 4H) with the EMA 50 and EMA 11. If EMA 11 is above the EMA 50, then I will set "Single side" on Long trades, otherwise "Both side". In the case of Short trades, on the contrary. I tested that in this case, the profit would increase by about 24% for 3 months (1H). And in these cases, for smaller graphs (15m-5m), I would even stop trades to protect the account. Thank you for this super EA and will post my results here more precisely.

I got tested so far to see how to avoid losses Please help and explain the "Survival Mode" logic? I understand that hedge only works if "ADX trend hedge" is enabled. Why can not hedge start as conditions for "survival mode" are met, but ADX hedge is disabled? I understand that if "ADX hedge" is not allowed, the "survival mode" will not work. Hedge reduces profits and if hedge actually needs for survival, then it does not work Maybe there is a future development or do I get it wrong? Best regards Marxx

Hi guys, Back test for the EA was great but on FT looks like fail. I think the calculation for profit taking was wrong. I'm using setting attached for EU TFM1.

hi, in your opinion, what should be the minimum balance to have with your settings? thx

Pyramid is the Good way but You need to use currency strenght metter for adjust Your lot size By exemple if thé ea start à buy pyramid on EUR USD and euro is Very strong and USD Very weak so thé séquence is more agressive.... Look CSM on h4 maybe daily ... Mmaybe You can use one indicateur of ferrufx like filter Ccfp diff Use H1 or h4 with weekly for filter and begin strong pyramid Regards

Mr. Edorenta. Thanks for this EA. Almost exact idea I have about grid. Can you help me with simple question about FF 2 Chart Hedge? I setup to True usage of FFcal 2 Chart with: Stop 100 minutes Start 100 minutes Keep Trade: True Hedge Trade: True After that I put Max Trades 50 and max trades hedge 50 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Before news, the EA Opens Hedge But not put any SL or TP in the hedge.. Now all (natural) opened trades closed in profit But Hedge still opened in here... no tp / no sl The question is about that....... What will happen now? I'm thinking the Hedge Trades will close when STOP 100 Minutes occur. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it correct? But I can see that it closed now one hedge (of 5 opened in same instrument) for nothing maybe? all opened same instante time.... How to control Hedge TP and SL in this case? (before NEWS) Thanks.... By the way. Can we test the new Grid EA Sytem from you? The Keops

After long testing of Long and Short trades separately, which did not make a good profit, as one party was in most cases losing money, I discovered a new method for using Autop v5.3 I'll trade Long and Short together. For example, the main settings of EURUSD 1H are: ADX 13/13, Sharpen entries and ADX trend = TRUE, ADX Trend Timeframe 15 min (always 4x smaller; for example, when EURUSD is 30 min, then ADX timeframe 5min), No Hedge, Scale-in. Test results are good. At the moment, I have been trading EURUSD 1H with profits for two months in a real account. I follow the trend and, if necessary, close profitable trade before I see that the TP is unrealistic. If necessary, I will put a profitable trade BE. This will ensure that EA will not be able to repair a loss-making trades, but will be able to start a new trades immediately in the opposite direction and make profit. Good profit for everyone!

Hello Folks. I'm working with this EA for about 21 days now. It's very nice about dynamic grid scalping big spike position before close entire cycle, Thus nice. BUT I'm figuring the best method to deal with News Filter. First I tried to Hedge is all but the EA opened hedge position in very high level os price spike making it useless.. So, I decided to close it all 20 minutes before the news.. but this action no works and trades Blow. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Edorenta, are you there? can you share The Keops. Can you explain News Filters Usage? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Mr. Edorenta just updated his Files Links... for who want to test more EAs to share Sets later give a try... https://github.com/Edorenta/trading_lab/ But I can't see indicators for EAs there. Thanks

I'm testing your set file with separately trades. TF only 1H, ADX 5min That's good result green growth's slowly and safty. (2XX cent, profit 10-15cent/week) this week I'll 30mins TF L/S 1 window. Your set file's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Ok...so am a bit confused on how to avoid the massive drawdown....I open trades and lets say my equity has gone down by $500. I decide to close all trades so now the worst that could happen is lose $500. I let the EA run and guess what it still opens trades in the same direction against the trend. so lose another $500. When do I stop the EA and when do I turn it back on. Am lost...what are your findings...and any tips to avoid the VERY big drawdowns would be highly appreciated. Thanks
