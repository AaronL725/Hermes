Taming the Trend Is about taking a piece out of the intraday range, using range bar only Continuing from..... https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...=681893&amp;page=8 Using Range Bars and ADR 14 Call it trend following, counter trend trading, breakout trading, What matters is that once you see the picture, you will know. you won't guess. Range bars clearly show beginning and end of moves based on daily ADR, I call it 'Taming the Trend' I trade live account and i try to capture 40 pips daily out of 130pip daily ADR ENTRIES: In most Range Bar Systems, I noticed alot of these systems are based on 3bar reversal. ( COUNTER TREND TRADING Possbily). IN THIS SYSTEM WE ENTER ON THE 2ND BAR WITH THE TREND DIRECTION ( NOT THE OPPOSITE). By the 3rd bar we are out already Meaning we wait for a completion of the 1st bar and then enter on the 2nd bar Do i enter right a way? No. I wait for pullback of few pips... \ Note: sometimes in volatile times, price shoots without pullbacks. Do i front run? yes and no depending how much more move left .. if it is really the first bar of the day.. hell yes i front run Do i add to position?... that also depends. Usually no enter heavy full size and exit all at once. do i always capture 45 pips.?. No lol as easy as it sound. i m capturing on average 25 a day. but im still practicing. but that is due to the trader's ability trading the system (That would be Me) but I will improve. This system is as good as I am Does range bars strategy have potential, Im a trader and only trade intraday ranges. The trader becomes focused on current action. and not trying to pick tops and bottoms. The market moves 100+pips daily. I promise you it will move another 100+ tomorrow in some direction and thats everyday. I ask myself how much of todays ADR has market moved? And did it move in compliance with the trend? or Is it in a pullback? I traded when times we had to execute trades over the phone. Charts were luxury. So yes for me ranges will do it. For Predicting tops and bottoms, analyst can do that better than anyone else I will keep updating this. but i ask people to comment, share, and ask questions.

Simple Setup Start Range bar chart for GBPJPY and place ADR indi and Pivot Range Bar 41 to 45 pips ADR 14 Pivot Daily ( reference Only) Things we keep an eye on Previous Day Pivots ( the real pivots) Open High Low Close . Yes these are the pivots Daily pivot Range Bar, High and Low for entry. I will explain more soon. But for now play with this setup. I promise you won't be sorry. Cause you are not predicting tops and bottoms. you are trading and trying to take a chunk out of the daily ADR and that happens when the move is confirmed. Trapping the ADR for 40 pips is interesting idea and i expect help develop using everone's thought process .

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Top Down Approach Monthly Weekly Daily 4hr 144.16 Monthly Weekly Break Point Retest 142.24 Daily Break Point Retest Now that trend is down. but ADR finished. Expect a retest to upside.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
On Range Bars 144.16 142.25 also shows a possible retest

--- 帖子 #5 ---
With this system you are not predicting tops or bottoms. We are staying within the Range Trend in this system we wait for bar ends to make decision. Market moves in 3 to 5 waves wave 1 market in buy wave 2 market in distribution Sell or wave 3 Market in buying on pull back ( reload for more up ) ( buy again) Wave 4 if wave 2 at sell, then expect Sell Short after if price was in pullback wave 5 rest back to balance. ( not sure what wave 5 is , but usually its either continuation or reverse) How to play it You wanna make your decisions to buy or sell, after the 1st bar finishes, that way expectation is that 2nd wave will move another full ADR Range Bar 1 ENDS = wave 1 BUY Range Bar2 begins = Distribution Sell ( closing positions) Range Bar 3 begins = not sure what to do with it. but hey, im all ears and open for suggestions

--- 帖子 #6 ---
We are practically Dissecting the range and filtering the move of 45 pips ranges 140 pips GBPJPY 1/3 of that 45pips 3 range bars will move to make that move, with pullbacks I think you can trap on 45pip bar.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
141.58 open and entry level to upside risk to downside 141.40 141.20 Reward to upside 142.25 142.55

--- 帖子 #8 ---
a safe entry would be around 141.40 with only 10 pips sl very possible A Two Lot Trader would hold for 1 range bar of 45 pips and exit 1 lot at bar end Hold Lot 2 for possible 3rd bar continuation.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
New range bar begins either 45pip up or 45 pip down ADR finished. buying at this level is an oppt.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Range bars with the Dragon.. wow you sure like adrenaline lol anyway my 2 cents; since range bars are all the same size there are certain patterns (like 3 bars reversal/continuation) that works very well and very reliable to catch a price imbalance and a move in your favor.. See the charts in that way and you will see what i mean; very easy to catch pips, the "boring" part its to wait for the bars whenever they feel like to paint

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Interesting Im using 2nd bar for decision either continuation or reverse. i will look at it your way. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #12 ---
20pip range bar reversal possible to upside first obsticle will be today's open expect 142.25

--- 帖子 #13 ---
40pip bar

--- 帖子 #14 ---
20pip bar pullback

--- 帖子 #15 ---
price needs to take out the open to the upside before the bulls take it all the way ful ADR. on the other hand. we had a busy week or month. we might see side ways movement in range of 30 to 40 pips. Even better to trade

--- 帖子 #16 ---
now we need to take out the HIGH to continue

--- 帖子 #17 ---
we are clear for take off 141.85 142.00 142.25 142.58

--- 帖子 #18 ---
its got to break 141.85

--- 帖子 #19 ---
141.85 is the High + 10pips for breakouts

--- 帖子 #20 ---
holding till 142.25

--- 帖子 #21 ---
welcome to the 2nd fucken 45pip range bar. buy is the norm

--- 帖子 #22 ---
price will move another 45 pip but wait for correction back a little

--- 帖子 #23 ---
keep an eye on time London open what happens at london open price will retrace back a bit and possible continuation later the first hour of london session high and low is important. cause that forms the IB for the session IB means initial balance for those who don't know its Market profile play

--- 帖子 #24 ---
buying on pullbacks along with the rising trend is the norm thats TAMING THE TREND

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Price currently pull back retesting 1st hour high.... buy is the norm on this pullback 141.70

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Being a trader is like a Caballero Knight Rider Only the Caballero can tame the horse ( Trend) Lets tame it together. Amigos. Trading is not about picking tops and bottoms.. thats for Analysts. Trading is trading the current action using reference points and statistical ranges. I Trade.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
oh by the way this works for most markets my past experience is stocks and sp500 emini but currencies is fun. amazing ranges.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
good job bro following

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Price needs to take out the 141.85 for spread breakout if we don't break above that level before london open i will drop my trade.. WHy? well... its risky and price will drop back to bottom for London Desk to reload the guns. They don't like to miss lower prices. . although their computers dont' sleep if price takes out the low of today 141.37 , buy stops can be placed with 40 pips profit

--- 帖子 #30 ---

Range Bars Pivots ADR 14 then use your favorite indi's to spice it up watch OPN HI LO CL these re your real trading pivots. all other are for trend identification

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Still waiting on offers to be lifted and price break above 141.85 then a push to upside is possible. No news till USA session

--- 帖子 #35 ---
1st hour London session comes. and price above 141.85 its possible that price retraces back downs to the hi 60s first (Lock an Reload for london boys). dont let that scare you . as long as price above the open, Longs are good

--- 帖子 #36 ---
watch the 1st 10 min of london open. it might turn market around. also mark the 20 and the complete full hour

--- 帖子 #37 ---
sleeping at today open

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Nice system. How long have you been trading this way? Also, are you still bullish on GJ for Monday? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Can you upload the indicators you use ?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post10114368 Cant download from this page

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Ok. I will upload the indis and templates i use. Im testing many indis to filter, but nothing is solid. except for ADR and Range Bars. Im bullish. GBPJPY yes. 142.65 Possible reversal Here is what happens usualy when we have a lower close on friday expect to see two days pull back before trend continues to downside and if we close on the hi on fridays expect two down days pullback before price gets back up why. cause of missed oppt in the markets. and Price fills I will post some charts also. For now Buy levels would be 141. 58 and sell level 142 60 remember above open or below open... is your trend identier.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Verily new. But i have traded for many years stocks and Emini using ranges and market profile , Im back in the game less than a year now. and i focused on forex and ranges. and im finding out its no different but rather even better since its 24hr market. I do still trade stocks and gold as well as GJ

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Indicators and Template uploaded to first post. I have an issue with the range bar indi. if anyone has a better range bar indi please share.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
OK. Thanks. Looks like a great system. Will follow along.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
this 41 range bar ends at 142.11 next bar retraces a bit, then buying would give another 41 pip range bar toward 142.50s

--- 帖子 #46 ---
If and when price drops below the previous low then its sell, cause that would be below the open as well. The open is your intraday pivot, above its buy , below its sell , then range bars with ADR 135 , filters the trend to find entry's

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Gold 7point Range Bar Same old story drop to 1278 possible then rebound toward 1304

--- 帖子 #48 ---
GY 4hr Chart. Price Heading toward 142.60 then if that breaks expect 143.05 ADR completion. if that completes and breaks above, expect another Full ADR ( might happen on tuesday) watch for price pullback around frankfurt open. re-newed buying after pullback toward the break of 142.20s

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Got in 142.39 Tp 142.62

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Now that price is at 60s what to expect. price will have a pullback at around frankfurt.. We do nothing for now. WAIT Wait for pullback toward 40s to get in on the long side, and wait for ADR completion at 143.05

--- 帖子 #51 ---
21 range bar high ends at 142.69 and 41 range bar high ends at 142.84 Price reaches 142.84 then its confirmed towrd 143.05 price stays below 142.69 expect return back toward todays open. ( not exactly but toward)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
HI FADI GOOD TO SEE YOU BACK WITH THIS GOOD THREAD HOWEVER, MY EXP. WITH RENKO AND RANGE BARS IS BAD. I Have developed many ea.s to trade these two crazy bars the first look is good but after few bars, as the chart is on off mode m2 or m4 or m6.... the bars will be not accurate and then you need to close the chart and reopen it or change the time frame then going back to the requird time frame.. \are you acing the same problem, if you do not then please guide me to the good setup for the range bars chart that it will not make this defect and i promise you you will get in your thread here a very strong ea's for the strategy

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yeah I know about MT4 . not very reliable, i keep refreshing the indi before the session I also use Ninjatrader8 with Interactive and I have Range bars also,

--- 帖子 #54 ---
bounce off of .65 buy points .40 .20 to be safe, wait for London IB to complete ( initial balance 1st Hr of the session) if bullish candle forms. its a buy if bearish, obviously more downside possible. price needs to take out .69 to see 143.05 or more below the open its all sell again

--- 帖子 #55 ---
And by the way, this inidi i uploaded is the cleanest i found. its accurate enough. setting it up. is easy. Just put on any time frame chart.. and open offline thats it. you can use templates uploaded. By the way I dropped the Pivot . as the daily open is a stronger pivot for intraday trading. while i dont reallly trade on MT4, i use Interactive brokers. and they don't provide MT4 so and expert isn't for me. but it would awesome that everyone here can make use of it. its honorable that you offer. Thank you

--- 帖子 #56 ---

--- 帖子 #69 ---

--- 帖子 #70 ---
if 60s hold and price bounce off, expect price to go back up toward 143.40 thn 143.60 possible if breaks to downside. expect the open an possible lower

--- 帖子 #71 ---
the current 4hr bar needs to close with demand. and close above 142.60 level, for bulls

--- 帖子 #72 ---
1hr

--- 帖子 #73 ---
scnerios if price closes above 142.60 , we know we need to buy if pice closes below, we know we need to sell but here is the thing. if price closes below, then price will go up first at the open of next hour to test for supply at 142.87 and cause of missed oppt ,

continuation to downside

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I know many sending me PM asking to explain entries and strategy, and some having issues with Range Bar indi I will Update the first post with more explanation as soon as i feel comfortable myself with the system at this moment im still testing and profitable and hoping everyone to participate, share and ask question, as that would help evolve things faster. For entries. I use the 2nd 45pip bar into the ADR. Meaning I wait for Range Bar 1 to finish 45 pips then i wait for pull back to buy hoping 2nd Range bar will move another 45pips range. For the indi issue. I really don't know how to solve that part. MT4 isn't a very reliable in my opinion. I would invest in ninjatrader with good data and get the range bars. for me the indi works fine. attach to any chart ( time isn't an issue and TF) and open offline. these are the settings . See Image After that go to FILE Open Offline see 2nd image and thats it.

41 pip Bar and 21 pip bar current 41 pip bar will end on the high of 142.62 my plan since i missed this current bar entry at 142.21 low i will wait for this bar to complete at .62 and then sell 21 pip bar shows pullbacks within the 41 pip .

--- 帖子 #93 ---
141.71 possible stop and reverse toward 142.30 again. then sell

--- 帖子 #94 ---
possible sell point at 142.30 lower target 90 pips at 141.40 obsticle would be 141.71 needs to clear to downside. lower targets 140.60 139.60 with 139.30 possible reversal

--- 帖子 #95 ---
139.00 gives in to downside. expect 129.00 before year end 139.00 holds and reverses traffic. expect 144.00 retest then drop

--- 帖子 #96 ---
45 pip bar

--- 帖子 #97 ---
since price is below weekly open, trend is down for the week for price to continue to next target 140.60 it needs to break 141.71 but before that price will rally toward 142.25 area for renewed selling below is the outline for possible weekly continuation and lower close on friday. if not expect run up after the break of 142.30 with target 143.30

--- 帖子 #98 ---
all in all, was ok. again lost on GOLD trade did well on GJ

What to expect? Im bearish overall GBPJPY till we reach 139.50 , then i start looking for signs of reversal. intraday, im looking for a pullback to sell around 141.40/60 Price currently below today's open. that might change around frankfurt/london session price gets above open, thats the que that its going toward 141.25 141.44 141.65 these are sell zones. might be chubby a bit, you may wait for price to drop below open again to sell. the only issue is that SL will be abit bigger. Reward is up to you Price is heading toward 139.00 very soon

--- 帖子 #112 ---
possiblity 2 GBPJPY price heads toward 140.40 first before we reverse up toward 141.60 Should we buy into the low. YES and NO. why. cause price might move lower. when can you safely do that and buy into the upmove? if you see a V shape candles or bars. then its reVersing and volume drying up on previous candle and increasing on current volume with both candles closing on the high.

Hopefully this helps. Follow the Daily ADR and let the open be your pivot. if you use range bars use the 2nd 45pips bar into the trend for entry. if you are advanced trader, i doubt you even need charts to trade. Just use the open of the day as main pivot How and when to trade.. London and US session are best at the open.

I will post best times of executions When I trade Stocks and EMINI SP500 contracts. Usually I adhere to time execution along with major support and resistance. Example: SP500 starts trading at 9:30 AM EST I know at 9:31 there is a trade either up or down. and another trade at 9:51 AM and another at 10:31 AM Currencies do the same. Pay attention to these reversal times. And if at around these times, price is near ADR high, ADR LOw, chances are its a high probability setup if confirmed by 2nd range bar. TIMES LONDON Session EST 2:00am EST 3:11am EST 3:46 am 4:55am 5:31am 8:15 am 8:31am Time US SESSION 9:31 9:46 9:51 10:01 10:31 10:46 11:01 11:31 11:51 LUNCH TIME USA ---NO Trading

2nd range bar, pointing up few more pips, but time isn't on our side. Lunch time NY EST

--- 帖子 #146 ---
2nd range bar from top, opened at 3:46am and sold down. why time is important? well, if you enter early you get stopped out only to see the trade going the way you bet on it from the first place. so timing your entry helps avoid stops. Why, cause Time = Volatility and Liquidity

--- 帖子 #147 ---
why this 2nd range bar from bottom isn't a good trade to buy into? cause TIME is against you. LIquidity pushed market to full ADR and below open. chances are price will close at the lower end of the day. Im not saying buying isn't going to work.. its probable . But im in the business of knowing and not guessing. ONLY TIME CONFIRMED trades

Hello Frank, Thanks for sharing. Are you still looking for a good range bar creator? This is an EA. Choose renko type; rail to rail. Attached File(s) MathTrader7_RenkoChartCreatorEA.ex4 51 KB | 229 downloads Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, look ovo.cz regards

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi FxHelp, Thanks for your hard work here and for also helping me see how to trade with Range Bars. I downloaded your templates and Range Bar Indicator but the Indicator is not creating any Range Bar charts. Please where am I to install the Range Bar Indicator? In the Indicator Folder or Experts Folder. Presently its in the Experts Folder but I tried the Indicator Folder too but it didn't work. Can you please point me out to what I am doing wrong? Secondly, can you please upload or point me to where I can get the Fibo Filter Indicator you use on your charts I really like it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
The EA in post 209 does it better to create a range (=renko) bar offline chart.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi RS, thanks for your reply. I do have that EA and that is what I am using presently and its really good but there is a particular formation I desire to see in normal range bar indicators that the rail2rail renko range bar doesn't show. That's why I still seek another. Thanks man for your help. Cheers

Then change the name of your thread or get Range Bars from the likes of OVO.CZ which are very good. Others here might know of other Range Bar providers/chart packages -that is if your thread is still going to be called "Range bar" trading? Just a thought.

I can use range bars from ninjatrader as a thought. but this thread is evolving toward less and less indicators down to bare metal. and also im trying to show that we don't really need that . all we need is ( dont even know what to call it) price action maybe, + ADR levels. Right now all i use is price action /market mechanics and daily range If i cant change the name. lets agree its evolving

gold on the move toward 1294-97 then rebound.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Easy... Price is below today's open.. that= downside movment. Price went up to a point and reversed sign number 2 that price isn't going up.. but above all we don't know for sure, its called SPECULATION ( not prediction) ALso you can use Volume VSA Volume SPread Analysis also to help find FAKE HEADS Fake Breakouts. or what have you. the idea here is not to predict, but let the marekt tell us what to do. price breaks a level, usually will retest the break.. chance 1 is to sell with it. chance 2 is to wait for retest. ( i know sometimes no retests . price pushes thru the QUE fast)

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Look at Gold, and tell me if this is reversal based on Volume. its H1 time frame. but it should be fine. for some traders, you can take the dead cat bounce from here for a quick 3 points. for some they leave it alone and wait on confirmation to break the level to downside or retest of the reversal

--- 帖子 #313 ---
GOld Here is 4H time frame same story. volume confirms that price capped at 1299. will it completely reverse or reverese a bit then drop more.. a trader can buy the bounce of 1299 for 3 pts on touch and reverse another would buy after on retest. another would wait for more points and wait for selling to hit the que and level is broken to downside

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Market Mechanics. General market movement based on OPEN to CLOSE relation or CLose to Open Relation. both are same in theory, but different in trade execution. What is Market mechanics. its OPEN HIGH LOW &amp; CLOSE and the relation of current price against these Numbers. SIMPLY put PRICE above open = buy day Price Below Open = Sell Day Price Above OPEN and ABOVE Yesterday's Close = buy PRice Below Open and Below Yesterdays Close = Sell PRice above OPEN and Yest CLose and Yst HIGH,, = thats no brainer.. its Initiatave buyers taken market to new highs. Pricee below open and yst close and yst low = Well,, Selling is the norm.. Most Look at market HI and LOW new High new low.. Very nice.. but still market mechanics are needed to understand what is happening today The Open tells you a story.. The CLose tells another story.. Both combined ,,, they make today's BOOK

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi Frank Thank you for answering my PM Where can I learn market mechanics? I really would like to be coached by you

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I did answer those questions, about market mechanics. its simply what most call it Price action however the naming conventions change from person to person. I don't dwell too much on Price action DOJI MOJO OUEJI..lol but i use OHLC and Ranges. I answered your PM.. its hard for me to do training now. cause im also responsible for managing funded accounts and I trade live. isn't what i do here enough??

GOLD waiting on 1294/3 for buys

--- 帖子 #318 ---
why it sold off of the 1299:? Simple answer price is below the open.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Now here is the Thing. if price of gold drops and closes today below 1294 .. then we are in bearish territory. and that will bring us back down to retest the previous week lows 1270-1259

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I wonder what u see feel and think when you trading Totally my style. Quick analyst and good trader. You seem to be in the know all the time. Keep it coming Thanks

--- 帖子 #257 ---
from here on. if gold closes today below 1294s expect more downside movement tomorow if price closes above, the we shall reverse and go back up again. let the market tip its hand first then we go along

--- 帖子 #258 ---
GOLD Gold above 1281, Strong buy. 20pts swing if price doesn't break that level, expect to see 1260

--- 帖子 #261 ---
GBPJPY Price at critical point. break above we see 150.00 revrese and we are back into 148.00

--- 帖子 #262 ---
good question a dead cat bounce is possible at Monthly pivot, I don't trade that. but i would wait for either a break and price to close above on the daily or weekly by friday, then would buy into retest or I would wait for reversal and then re sell, but that would be against the trend a bit. For now I would wait for market to tell me what to do. this way im not guessing, i m knowing. By the way, the answer to your PM is still No.
