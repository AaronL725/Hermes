17-12-2023 My fellow forex trader friends. I have to make a hard decision now. All those years, up's and down's. I really tried my best to make this strategy work, but I failed to prove profitability. Therefore be very careful trading using methods described in this and my earlier threads. I'm sorry I failed you. Throwing in the towel for now, but once I regain strength I will continue pursuing the financial trading dream. Wishes my brothers on FF will make it one day. Giving up was never an option for me, but I do not wish to promote something here not profitable. All our times are too valuable for that, just know I did all with the best intentions. Farewell for now, I will take a break on FF and only return if I come closer to the Holy Grail. Been depressed lately and my apologies for not answering threads and private messages. I struggle with my mood and unemployment, can't even afford Christmas gifts. Thanks everyone for the loyal support here throughout the years and best of luck in your future endeavors. Best regards, yours Lekkim &lt;3

Attached is random charts from different time frames explaining and showing clear and strong trade signals. It's simple, trade it when red price does not follow green volume. Give it a try and good luck

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Added poll to this new thread, hope we can do even better than same poll from my last thread about Cumulative Delta Price Volume. Feel free to give me some feedback, but please test it before deciding.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Tell me please where you see buys and sells on forex? Can you show the screenshot where to see it?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
This is the best strategy ever, I've been looking for such system for months, thanlks for your help.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Can you be more specific? Do you refer to where the indicator gets volume data from or where to see the volume data in template setup? And what exactly do you request screenshot from or of?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thank you for your compliment. I knew I wasn't the only one with these thoughts, I've looked for a solid volume indicator for many years who would fit and show cumulative delta lines alongside with price, hope that I finally figured it out after all these years.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You are advertising indicator that calculates cumulative delta of buys and sells (as seen on its description). So please show me the screenshot where you see that data in MT5 terminal? Can't find it. Can you help me?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks, but Ive got just one question, all the red line is price and the green one is volume? because there are more than 2 of them in the chart. Thank you very much for your reply sir.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I'm not advertising anything, I recommend the free indicator because I find it best to use. Other volume indicators can be turned into green lines also, for example PVT, OBV, and Positive and Negative volume indicator. You see cumulative of buys and sells in top left corner of indicator as attached. It calculates from volume tick data. However what the number is isn't really important since it will differ broker to broker, what's important is the green volume lines movement compared to red price movement.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Man, I'm terribly sorry but there are only 2 options here: 1. You are liar 2. Or you are an idiot thinking that what you said is truth And the fact: both options... your thread is scam and lie. THERE ARE NO TRADES DATA on FOREX, and you, "traded since 2015" MUST know it. Who the heck you are trying to cheat and why? Show me SCEANSHOT where you see order flow? Where you see trades? Buys and sells? Ah, you will proceed your idiotic "can't understand what you Spanish guys is talking about"?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You should have some respect and behave yourself. Are you drunk? Try again to ask me nicely and I might use my time explaining it for the third time.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
There are 3 red price lines and 2 green volume lines. Two of the red are price overlay from indicator and last one is MA1, they differ but works well together to eliminate noise. The two green lines are volume delta with two different calculation methods explained like this: The method of decomposition of candles volumes into buyers and sellers volumes - 'All' - the whole volume is involved in decomposition and - 'Active' - only the volume that produced the movement is involved in decomposition. Also here it makes for best entries to use both.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Second try. I asked you: 1. Are you idiot that don't understand that forex has no volume and trades data? (That can't be true since you said you have 15 years experience) 2. Are you scammer who is trying to cheat us?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
You have a rude behavior and you are disrespecting me for all my hours I put into helping other traders here for free. I'm not into dislike or censoring, but you should stop being toxic here.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Why you expect respect from me when you are just cheating us? I must respect you because you are trying to cheat me? You said you are experienced trader, you have 15 years. But this is lie. It is impossible to trade for 15 years and don't know that forex has no order flow. Now you said you are trying to help other traders? Wow. What is the help? To cheat? To lie them? Arte you sure they need "that" help? I asked you 1 simple question: show me the screenshot of the orderflow from your MT5. Where is that data? ah? Stop cheating us. Show the data first. After that you can say if I have respect or not. SCAMMER DETECTED OR YOU SHOW ORDEFLOW SCREENSHOT, OR YOU ARE SCAMMER

--- 帖子 #17 ---
You have anger issues, what about you stop editing your post 10 times in 10 minutes and actually read what I text and look at the charts. It's pretty simple but somehow you have no understanding of volume in trading or how to extract data from tick volume in metatrader. What are you on right now? I know it's Saturday night but still.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I found a Spanish wine for you, here you go relax yourself ryuryu, lol

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Vote so far so good, glad to see 1.500 views 50 traders downloaded on first day. I'm looking forward to do live trades alongside you starting next week. Green pips for all and thanks for support and messages. Hope we all gonna make it as a strong community. I enjoy the visuals in the template, easy for the eye and simple, would make me proud if other fellow traders would appreciate and use it.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Nevermind she jumps from thread to thread with the same theme and attitude now ran away to her thread to seek support... ryry, I'm 100% sure that this indi (link in first post https://www.mql5.com/en/market/produ...al#description ) uses the same principle as yours you made on TradingView and selling on one of the platforms https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14288765 Go hide, scammer.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This trading individual seems to have serious trust issues, I've seen some of you dealt with him before. Just ignore him, I will answer his silly questions if asked nicely. I checked even without me disliking his posts in this thread, the results are 2 likes and 13 dislikes. I guess that says everything. Cheers gentlemen, enjoy your Saturday night

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I can see that @ryuryu has called out your approach but doesn't appear to have explained "why", clearly enough, IMHO. You state that the indicator is based on Cumulative Delta and for this to be possible, you need a volume feed that allows you to deduce Delta volume. Unless you are using futures price data/volume, it's simply not possible to deduce Delta volume from "normal" MT4/5 tick data/volume. Tick data doesn't know or show the number of contracts bought or sold at any price point. All tick data shows is where price has traded but not how many buys/sells were transacted at each price point. That information can only come from an Exchange. So, whether the indicator/strategy works or not, at best, it can only be trying to "deduce" an approximation of buying and selling. Delta volume is really the difference between buying and selling at any price point. You need this information before you can average it into Cumulative Delta. Some Cumulative Delta indicators on MT4/5 will analyse the M1 timeframe and effectively assume that a bullish candle close is buying and a bearish candle close is all selling. Then, that information is calculated across the other timeframes to give a pseudo-assessment of buying/selling ie., faux-Delta volume. However, unless you are trading real price data from an exchange, there is no way that an indicator can provide accurate Delta volume and therefore, not Cumulative Delta either. Hopefully, that explains the reaction you received. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Appreciate your detailed post. It's the closets thing you come to cumulative volume delta IMO. There is no such thing as exactly trade data of metatrader retail clients. Tick data is the closest you will come. I've tested many platforms and trading software's as well as CME options and futures data and Bloomberg advanced. Just download it and give it a try, then you might understand me more. I've looked at this exact template for 3 years, optimizing, analyzing how to use it profitably. This whole thing is advanced AF, even for me with so much experience. I'm just saying, load the template and follow trade instructions, then you might also be able to understand it better and answer some of my uncertainties. But again, when red price moves way away from green volume it's a good trading opportunity. Call it tick volume call it garbage, this is what I most believe in throughout testing about 1.000 indicators and strategies for 15 years. I love constructive criticism like you give, because it forces me to think it all through. Never the less I'm just here sharing what I believe to be most profitable, what ever happens my intentions are clean and good. I want to succeed and make a living just like you. Let's see how next week goes where I will be trading live here in thread and on live verified myfxbook account. Also looking forward to feedback from other traders. Cheers

Perfect timing just confirmed my sell on ETH/USD 30 min chart thanks and very cool system

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Nice to hear, Dino10! And thank you for your kind words about my system. Feel free to share your trading chart with us all.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Exiting week coming up. Beforehand I will be doing a complete excel spreadsheet analysis of all 28 forex pairs on all timeframes, to be able to have the overall signals and trade entries. I will of course share this with you and show you how to do it. In able to get full overview of FX market you need to analyze the data of all pairs. Will be sharing the spreadsheet also, so you will be able to do it yourself. Also I will do comparison of 3 different MT5 brokers and overlay them for further confirmation of opportunities. You all have a blessed Sunday ahead, best wishes

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Lekkim, When it comes to price and volume movements, to achieve accuracy, we could further analyise strength and weakness of 28 pairs in a particular timeframe, and find out a pair with strength currency against weakness currency as well as the one pair which is diverted from among pairs. What do you think and we need to code that indi? This would eliminate those bad and manipulated entries. Edit: Sorry, I just saw your last post mentioning similar.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
This picture I made in my first price volume thread in 2019, still relevant and makes sense. As I see it there are two outcomes of this thread: 1. I've developed a consistently profitable trading strategy and we can all profit from it. 2. I can't kill my darling and I'm in a state of delusion, if this we still might still learn something, but I personally will be ruined. Time will tell. What's funny about me, is I tend to work much harder and concentrated when I share with fellow traders. My pride and ego is on the line, but it's the only way instead of being in your own mind state of echo chamber. I've been glued to FF for two days now and I really enjoy chat exchanges. So thanks everyone. Stay tuned and have blessed Sunday.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I just have one question, when I zoom in, it is not the same picture (sorry for my bad english) I mean the indication is changing? so what is the level of zoom that we should focus on, to get the right data.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Provided indicator shows anything but not cumulative volume delta. I said that indicator not calculates buys and sells because there are no data about buys and sells on forex. If candle green all "tick volume" is positive, if red it is negative. So you can use cumulative ATR and it will be the same. BTW if you don't believe me you can check post 280 on the indicator page where the author describes how it works. But in fact everyone knows what tick volume is and how it works. Except may be some "experienced" traders I guess. I just said that this indicator is fake and the description of it is fake too. And I said nothing about strategy bases on it. Strategy based on fake data is fake. I just wonder why trader said he has 15 years of experience in trading forex but don't know the basics. How you can be sure if you don't have that indi and will never have it? It is not for public and you can't have it. Again lie. This thread is 100% lie. One lie about his experience, second lie in indicator description, third lie about my indicator. Nice. Have you ever tried to live at least one day without any lie? p.s. of course my dear dumb friend, if you use indicator on fake data you will get fake results. And it doesn't matter who has created it. Is that not clear for you? Or you expect that fake tick volume data will become magically real trades data?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
How you can be sure if you don't have that indi and will never have it? I don't need your fake indi, thanks. Because I know how it works, newb. Dedicated software processes data from T&amp;S. TV/MT4 doesn't have it. No Bid, no Ask. Only volume per candle is available, if candle is bearish -&gt; volume is negative, then script accumulating intrabar values for selected time-frame. So you have real ticks from CME Don't try to be smarter than you are, scammer ryry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #32 ---
You are digging yourself deeper and deeper in your lie. First you show "magic" indicator for mt5. If look it has fake description and fake calculations. Now you show CME data. Okay good, so how you are able to use MT5 indicator with CME data? Stop that please, it is too funny to read how you try to save face and not look stupid. Keep scam people with fake indicators based of fake data. No need your reply. I just said that "pro trader" is not a trader but scammer. And the indicator provided is scam and fake. And that forex has no volume data and no indicator can show volume, delta, cumulative or whatever. Not interested in that discussion anymore. You have already shown who you are and what is your level.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
No, you need my reply. You missed the point, happens when u are dumb scammer. Your indicator is no better than the one on the first page. Dedicated software processes data from T&amp;S. TV/MT4 doesn't have it. No Bid, no Ask. Only volume per candle is available So you have "real ticks" from CME If look it has fake description and fake calculations. Just like yours. Be fair. Okay good, so how you are able to use MT5 indicator with CME data? Futures trading is available in MT5 and it can get volume data from CME But any indicator that takes into account the volume/ticks/whatever of the candle and not the bid/ask works on the same principle. Go hide, stop polluting the thread with your presence. My apologies to Lekkim for using the thread to stick ryry's scammer's nose into his lies...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hey Buddy, thanks for your reply. Just want to assert that my post was in no way intended to be criticism of any kind, it was just my take on the reaction you received

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I don't dispute anything you say from a technical perspective. I don't know whether you have some kind of history or ongoing feud with Lekkim. From my perspective, your reaction seemed somewhat aggressive and personal. I just tried to explain why you might be calling everything "fake" and "scam" by explaining the "why" in case Lekkim didn't know/realise. That's it.

Hey all I had some personal matter to take care of, which resulted in me being offline from FF in two days. I'm back now and will be online throughout the whole trading day today.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I'm glad you started this topic. I already tried the delta approach before, but unfortunately I got stuck with its further development. Now I took it up again.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello Lekkim, thank you for sharing this system. I've never seen anything quite like it. Can you please help to clarify for me, how exactly a signal looks like? I am still quite confused. Exactly what do I look for to press "Buy" or "Sell"? Thank you for your help!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
there is a phenomenon where the exchange rate is forced to reverse in order to maintain equilibrium. and after reaching a certain level, the balance is restored. this is mainly observed on smaller time frames. we try to indicate in advence this change with delta..

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Interesting idea, but tick volume is not true "True" Volume (in terms of the actual volume of contracts/shares, etc., traded). So, (@Lekkim) I'm curious how volume can be used as an indicator for trading Forex? I apologize in advance if this question has already been asked... haven't completely read all the posts. Although I will say, there was a research article published a few years ago that indicated tick volume was a good approximate for True volume. Another concern is that the "volume" for each pair is going to change from broker to broker due to the decentralized nature of the forex market, so if you're using a tick volume indicator it would need to be using the tick volume specific to your broker. Best, Dave

--- 帖子 #42 ---
That research report was funded by who? Tick volume is fraud, not even close. Try it on a Futures market to see the truth.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi everyone. I found this in my files. maybe of some help. best

--- 帖子 #44 ---
This bloke knows the truth about volume. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14334274 He's spent a documented small fortune on developing an indicator that shows the way and after a year and a half has f*%k all to show for it. He now wants wants someone to stump up $450 a month for the data. If he really had the grail, he would self fund and keep quiet!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Why you always lie my friend? 1. This is simple EA written with python for MT5. This EA I made just to try out the MT5 python connector (btw it is profitable). 2. You can check the source code of that bot, because it is totally free and you can find it on my github. And you can see it has no volume data checks. 3. I never asked anyone to buy be anything. That guy said that he can buy the lifetime subscription for clusterdelta, but I said that it is not a way because cd code is not open source and I just don't know what variable names it has so I'll never get the data from it. 4. For 1 year, as you mentioned, I have created discord group, telegram channel, telegram bot, website, dashboards, 11 indicators and 16 repositories on github (and countless amount of bots, scripts and other stuff). Tell me please what have you done for last year, dear? I think instead of being my fan and checking all my activity day by day you better spend your time to learn basic math. Believe me it will help you better.

I would back him (ryuryu). I've read his posts and can see his movement forward. Recently it's been leaps ahead, so his learning has accelerated. 1 to 1.5 years is nothing in this industry. It took me 14 years before I had something that worked consistently. He is on the right path. How is your trading? Have you taken what you've already learned and put what you understand the best and can "see", onto a chart, then traded it for months, figured out what was missing and found it, traded it for months and made your own system or are you on my 14 year plan of jumping around from thing to thing and "guru" to "guru" with nothing to show for it? It's tough in this business, but the people who make their own way are the one who are the most successful.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes of course. Now Rick bring a self proclaimed successful businessman should really see the potential in you, but he’s not stumping up $450 and your 13,000 trades from your previous post isn’t either, Thanks for stopping by.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Were you going to answer my question? How is your trading? Have you taken what you've already learned and put what you understand the best and can "see", onto a chart, then traded it for months, figured out what was missing and found it, traded it for months and made your own system or are you on my 14 year plan of jumping around from thing to thing and "guru" to "guru" with nothing to show for it? It's tough in this business, but the people who make their own way are the one who are the most successful.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Rick, I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you, but - and I don't remember the specific details of the academic research article- the authors state that tick volume could be used as a proxy for true volume, or probably better to say, "degree of active price movement". I'd hypothesize that if you plot the number of transactions at any given price point, within a specific time period, a price point that has a higher number of transactions could be a point of support/resistance versus a price point with a lower number of transactions with regards to assessing future price activity. But again, my reservations is that tick volume will be highly specific to your broker, so you just can't take a generic data feed to assess tick volume. @rosalieone - thanks for providing that pdf! I'll have to search for the academic article that I referenced in my previous post, but the conclusions seem to be the same. Best, Dave

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Am I obliged to answer your question, no. Have you and I interacted before, no. Did I stop Rick and the boy wonders previous attempt at funnelling saps into joining them on Crypto where the saps were being used to provide liquidity, yes. Do you want the boy wonders trading view indicators that were for sale on his website, then look for the last post by Bluesteele on the boy wonders thread and open your eyes! You’ll find that boy wonder minimised the post but he can’t delete it! Educate yourself.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
In real life on real exchange candles forms with trades. There are buys and sells. So first buy or sell is open, last is close. Somewhere inside there can be high and low (or they can be equal to open or close). Sum of buys and sells called volume. Now let's check forex. Tick data is not trades. It is price and direction. They are using it to draw candles. All you have here is speed. Yes, you can calculate the speed of incoming ticks and measure it. In fact, all you have on forex: OHLC and speed of ticks. No volume, no trades. So you can never get data to calculate for example 3-in-a-row approach we are trading. Because your "tick vol" data will always draw you same color as the candle. Next you will never calculate the delta - the difference between buys and sells, because there are no data for that. Have you ever seen any statement or rules what tick volume is, how it calculated and regulated? Nope. Never. Because it is fake and fraud. What academic researches and proofs you need more?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Bluesteele got destroyed by Ryuryu when he commented on his post - Bluesteele never came back. Your comments here sound like a jealous brat that has no clue how to trade so why don't you do us all a favour Move along like Blue

--- 帖子 #53 ---
what do you suggest how to measure the imbalance condition in forex. because the phenomenon exists.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thank you for your sharing. It's an interesting topic indeed..... So, basically you're a counter trend trader trying to pick top/bottom....

Hi davelansing Ryuryu answered very well, but if I can make a few comments. What controls price direction is not size of Volume (executed market orders) but rather the density of the liquidity its attacking. So we may be able to read size of volume, or even be lucky enough to know the balance of Delta within those executed trades - but unless we know the strength of Asks above price or the strength of Bids below price - its still a calculated guess. Ryan &amp; myself study the bias of Market orders to determine which way price is likely to swing, its an calculated guess but its still an edge if you know what the real data is, but no edge if you can't see those Buyers or Sellers. But we can do better Let me talk about a stock trade I took today on ABB.AX (Aussie Broadband) which was about $2.97 at the time. The order book was Bearish around 60% and bullish about 40% so price was drifting down. Market orders were primary Selling orders but the market was overal thin. I couldn't Buy because the order book was Bearish, I could also sense price was going to drop further. I ended up Buying down at $2.89 because I knew when the Sellers were extreme, the big players would step in and Buy back the market. Therefore like Futures, You go Long when Sellers are too strong, you go Short when the Buyers are too strong or You go Long when Sellers are too strong when DELTA FLIPS and you go Short when Buyers are too strong when DELTA FLIPS i.e. Ryans three in a row setup

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I recommend using CME data for EU, GU and XAU. Works pretty good. For other assets you can use direct API (like for crypto).

--- 帖子 #59 ---
thanks for the advice.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Sorry, but I didn't see your posts because they were blocked. You were blocked because you're probably an asshole. Because I only block assholes. Unfortunately, I can't remember why I identified you as an asshole, but if so, then so it is. I'm a guru in this. I'm never wrong. P.S. Say thanks to RickM - he told me about new idiotic shit you've posted. Rejoice, you have been noticed. But you shit yourself again.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
What's up Rick, another volume thread, you sniffing out a possible sale?? More fish??? Bluesteele hung Ryu out to dry, destroyed Ryu by copying the sales page for his indicators, the indicators that change on a daily basis. Along with the magic method. Ryu should be in Commercial. Someone pissed on your parade...again?? Just so we're all on the same page Rick, here is the sales page, obviously changed since then but here it is. https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...l?d=1673834478 Toodlepip.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hey Rick, just a a thought. Kev never came back. That's right. Where should he have come back too Rick? Ryu blocked Kev, remember!!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yes, very much a possibility of selling at that point.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Crikey. Not getting involved here lol, trading day starts in 10 But if those items on that link above are for sale by our Forex Factory member ryuryu then he really should register himself on FF as Commercial. Commercial is NOT a punishment. It is just an honest acknowledgement by an FF Member saying they are selling items. Many good folk on FF have put their hands up to correctly identify themselves to others on this site that they are commercial (its especially helpful for new members coming to FF looking for guidance in any way on trading). If ryuryu is encouraging FF members to go over to a Non FF Site where his items are sold THERE, and not on FF, it would still make ryuryu a Commercial Member over here in FF. But has ryuryu acknowledged that he IS selling items, is that link correct or not. I am sure NEITHER Moodybot or Bluesteele would have any objection to any trader making money by selling their wares on any platform, as that is their right as a person in a free world. But on FF they do have to Register themselves as Commercial as I understand it. Best to do the right thing maybe. Up to ryuryu to acknowledge that he is or has sold something though.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Lekkim, sorry pal, back to trading

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I've read every post I could find of ryuryu's over the last two weeks and have not come across one where he said go to this or that website and buy something. My preference would be to be able to continue following his growth and learning as he walks us through the math side of how the big$ trades and what gives them their edge. That is much more valuable to ff users than locking up someone so they cannot "think out loud". Getting stuff down on virtual paper helps get it out of the head and allows the person some feedback as well as clearing the way for their next step. I did the same process on ff a few years ago. People who do this get to profitability faster than whiners and naysayers who likely never make a penny trading.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I've been on ff a few years more than you and have interacted with you...it's always been negative from your side and it's always been after you've posted something trying to destroy someone. I'm sorry that you are not able to answer my question as it suggests you are no a consistently profitable trader. That's why I was trying to help you with walking you through what worked for me and ended up making me successful. Go back and re-read the steps and do them. Being successful changes the attitude and you'll likely start trying to help and encourage people instead of tearing them down.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Many thanks for the offer but I’ll rain check on this one. Can you show me where we conversed, I honestly do not remember you. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I just went back to try to follow your logic on this. You state, "He now wants wants someone to stump up $450 a month for the data. If he really had the grail, he would self fund and keep quiet!" But, here's what he actually said, and anyone can go read the link that you provided for his post: "Next step is to implement CME data into MT5/python to have our famous 3-in-a-row trading. For now I don't know how to make it without buying full CME package (it is about 450$/mo). But may be it worth it, because from 100k you can make easy 250/day, so that 450$ fee is just 2 days of trading... Or may be I can get all that data using another software like ClusterDelta. Anyway this is a big task for future." He never asked anyone to pay anything for him. So, you might actually owe him an apology for making things up about what he said.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
lol, you have a red diamond...you've posted a lot. Hope you're able to become profitable some day.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
@Ryuryu I am fortunate to have known him through ff and learned a lot from him. It's also difficult to inject people like you ready to help anyone who needs help with trading no matter the time. Do you bring any benefits to yourself when you help others? Of course not special with me . I believed most traders on ff they knew me , i am a slow leaner ,very hard for them to help me,even now .Ryuyu , thanks for being here to help many trader specially me ,you never ask any from me ,some time i felt like you hold my hand to help me. Thanks Ryuryu again . I forgot to let you know the new indi you gave me on TV , i loved it . I start to trade gold base on that indi , once i will trade crypto with that indi too. Thank @Ryuyu .

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi cash, Welcome back to FF. ALL (new) ideas are great, and can help newcomers to trading and I agree with you completely. Rick’s volume ideas, that he was discussing openly many years ago with me &amp; others, which ryuryu took hold of from Rick, are valid. Rick had the 1min vol working and then he chased deeper as I remember into tick and “real” volume CME (ie NOT forex tick data activity) to find his own advantage down in the depths of (absent) volume. This is great for traders who wish to trade in that micro arena (1 candle, 2 candle, 3 candles etc). I looked, and looked hard, but for the way that I trade (intra-day scalp/swing) I found that vol was just not necessary for me. As Vol didn’t explain to me where price was headed or to which targets (ones above and below current price). My ideas that I formulated from many things I was shown and helped with in my journey were attacked by ryuryu at the beginning a year ago. No probs, he had his own way (well Ricks way that is). But when someone attacks your own ideas (mine &amp; others) and you then find they might be selling their ‘ own ’ ideas by rubbishing someone else’s, then in business that is a huge no-no and by law not allowed. But each to his own. Look its hard to find info and to be honest I don’t really care. I have said on many occasions I wish ryu &amp; rick well in their trading. We all do what we can in this tough game. No ONE way of trading is the only way, and not ONE way of trading is best imho. So good wishes to all trading. Here’s a couple of recent posts posts ryuryu made about his off-site Discord Channel. I do not subrcribe, have never looked myself, or even care much about what he &amp; others do there, even stuff he sells if he wishes, good luck to him. When Andy put up a link above and when I looked at it (a bit small to read lol) I DID see pricing on items at the bottom. Only a subscriber or ryuryu himself can explain what was for sale there if anything. It doesn’t bother me, but if selling then FF rules say that is a Commercial Member, end of story. Again, I wish all well, it’s a tricky game trading, but enjoyable. - - - oh yeah, here's the off site discord channel mentioned &amp; posted recently, maybe you could join and clear it all up once and for all on behalf of ryuryu https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post14335898 https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...8#post14335898 If there is nothing for sale, please advise us and this can ALL be put to bed immediately (as I only wish to trade lol and post the odd chart or two hahaa) all the best

You understand that the EA he has posted based on his wondrous method is a perpetual loser saved by an account blowing martingale. You looked at the numbers right? No!! Thought not. You know he tried to funnel traders into crypto, to use his indicators. What’s wrong with that you may ask. If you did your homework you’ll know that there wasn’t enough money on the table for them to trade! And tell me this, what would you do with an indicator that you could speed up or slow down to benefit oneself from others using the same product on a market with limited availability! Any thoughts on that cashbox!! And as to the the method, trading crypto short! Well that went well! How about you look at his discord group, nope, we’ll that’s worth a read. So let’s summarise, a self confessed guru coder, guru volume trader, funnelling people from FF through to his discord group with a sales page in his website with a crypto based method trading short that took a hammering with account size limited by lack of participation running around the forum as though someone had pissed on his parade. For craps sake, is it that hard to understand.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
0.1,0.1, then a 700% increase to cover No angle needed Rick, it’s clearly laid out. The EA has martingale recovery. I’ve had one trader who I have never heard of block me, perhaps another catch for you Rick. Can you ask the others to block me, more fish for you the better, eh Just make sure they put their results here ok. And just remember this, Ryu hijacked this thread followed by you. Just a fishing expedition for you, and you’ve been allowed on my thread for over a month, nothing, nada! Go Brandon!! On your way out Rick please put the cutlery back!

A shame, it's turning into a tragedy now, if true I'm hoping CashBox will verify all this one way or the other. I looked and thought $69 for an indi, pretty much like on the mt5 sites, no probs. Then read the small print. $69 a month, each month as a subscription. Still its a business so no real probs to me. Trader now goes to Twee and declares himself Commercial if true. All good. The only grubby thing imo is not so much the selling of a Delta Indi for a $69 monthly subscription, that is just business so no probs. BUT THEN To come on to another ... " DELTA named Thread" ...opened on FF by another trader Lekkim, on the Trading Systems thread, and bagging Lekkim for his efforts. Come on, not cool imo, let your own product sell or not on its own merits

Lekkim, could you please put moodybot TimeTells bluesteele to ignore list? They are ruining your good thread. They have nothing to say about volume and only post off-topic. Also I must say that I never posted a link and never said that I'm selling something on FF. So if you idiots are promoting me for free then you (moodybot, TimeTells, bluesteele) must be marked as commercial members not me. I suggest you go back to your scam thread and draw your idiotic lines there. As you see people don't want you here.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi ryuryu, I don;t think anyone suggested you were selling something here on FF . But can you clear it up for everybody here and now. Once and for all. Are you selling anything trading related outside of FF?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Are you selling or renting out indicators to be used on TradingView. A simple question. It’s a yes or no. A simple yes or no!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
You are clearly off-topic. Why should you follow somebody around on forum like this? how does Ryu's comments/actions affect you. You can simply ignore Ryu or not participate on discussions with him, he is not forcing anyone to engage with him.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This was I believe your third or 4th post on this thread. Before Pete Kev or myself looked at what you were doing! ——————————————————————————— Man, I'm terribly sorry but there are only 2 options here: 1. You are liar Quote I've been researching, tested and traded financial markets for 15+ years and tried almost everything. 2. Or you are an idiot thinking that what you said is truth And the fact: both options... your thread is scam and lie. THERE ARE NO TRADES DATA on FOREX, and you, "traded since 2015" MUST know it. Who the heck you are trying to cheat and why? Show me SCEANSHOT where you see order flow? Where you see trades? Buys and sells? Ah, you will proceed your idiotic "can't understand what you Spanish guys is talking about"? Ryu Why are you asking for us to be blocked?? You are refusing to admit that you are commercial. You are delusional absolutely delusional!

How i get caught up in this sh ! te AGAIN is beyond me lol. But you are correct Andy, Lekkim started a Trading System thread on Cumulative DELTA ryuryu came in with this post and is now pretending to be Lekkim's friend, omg https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...5#post14330685 ryueyu drew all the attention to himself. But IF ryuryu is selling/leasing monthly a delta indicator himself, then his turning up on Lekkims; thread is not by chance. IF he is selling/leasing a delta indi at $69 amonth does he NOT see how bad it looks to call the OP here on a new thread a liar. How does ryuryu not see he has compromised himself. Will someone please, as I have already asked cashbox lol MAYBE FERNA just join the Discord Channel and advise if ryuryu is selling/leasing monthly a Delta Indi of his own. Goodness me. if only ryuryu would just say NO he is not and has never sold/leased trading gear we could stop this to and fro. If NO that's great if YES then just declare himself to Twee as Commercial so that new &amp; highly hopeful FF members can understand the nature of the situation. There are many great Commercial Members and everyone also then knows where they stand. This should not have been so difficult lol

--- 帖子 #90 ---
or this post ryuryu while STILL on Lekkim's first page , have you no shame. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14330704 When you accused poor Lekkim of being a scammer . Mate no one hates you ryuryu, we are just wondering about your motives of coming on a random Delta Thread with your vitriol (especially if YOU are trying to attract paying customers from FF to go to Discord for the completion of your OWN Delta sale) Folks are just wondering if you are the scammer ryuryu, that's all. Please for the love of god Are you Commercial ?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Once @Lekkim used the word "volume" everybody went berserk... In post #43 @Rosalieone brought up an interesting article illustrating tick frequency could be a proxy for trade volume, but nobody was listening anymore. @ryuryu, @W0lfram, @RickM, @moodybot, @CashBox, @TimeTells, @bluesteele: Congrats, you have succesfully killed @Lekkim's thread with many posts fighting and accusing each other. Too bad we will not able to learn from @Lekkim's ideas...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
You understand that Ryu insinuated that Lekkim was a scammer right! The thread would finish right there, And it’s not the first thread that Ryu has pissed all over. While he is able to post as a normal member ever thread that follows based on volume will suffer from the Rick and Ryu roadshow!

No rage Rick. And no jealousy, in fact jealous of a scammer, do me a favour. The other commercials are waiting for their new compatriot! Adios amigo..

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Let's calculate volume of idiots and delta (good people vs idiots) in this thread? And cumulative idiots volume as well since the thread named Cumulative Delta Price Volume. First we need to create variables Inserted Code good_member = ['RickM','Ryuryu','yoriz','Cashbox','munchie''] (and many others, sorry if miss you in that example) Inserted Code idiots_and_scammers = ['moodybot', 'TimeTells', 'bluesteele'] to calculate how many good members we have we can use python. Inserted Code all_good = len(good_member) The same way we can caclulate how many idiots and scammers we have here: Inserted Code all_bad = len(idiots_and_scammers) Then let's sum both values, like Inserted Code total = all_good + all_bad Now, if total = 100%, then idiots = Inserted Code all_bad * 100 / total

That’s not the point. You are suggesting to me to sneak up on Ryu on another social media platform that isn’t regulated by Forexfactory.com’s rules. Don’t you understand that’s wrong and in the boundaries of legal harassment? What’s next? Seek up another person on Social media like facebook? What does Ryu’s personal life concern me, or anyone of us? He clearly shared some contact info to those he wanted in his life, but that’s his decision. What goes on in his personal life, or on other platforms doesn’t concern us unless we have been given consent. I am for a high roof of tolerance, but making this personal and with some vendetta-like nature is very unprofessional. If Ryu are breaking any of Forexfactory’s rules, that’s a concern for this forum -engagement in other social media is not.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Reading his thread would have helped you but I'll condense this down so that you can take your attitude and turn it into something a newby would be proud of. The method was designed to run on Crypto, short. There is only enough liquidity to operate a tiny account. You will know that they were using $50 ... actually perhaps you didn't know. You purchase the indicator along with all the other saps thinking you're onto a good thing. You cannot trade when you want, not enough liquidity. Read the thread, its all documented. You all trade at the given signal, thankyou very much you are providing much needed liquidity. Those that control the indicator have an advantage over you! They trade either before or after you and your fellow saps all trade one way. He is limiting the indicator to 2000 subscribers paid $69 monthly at a reasonable profit of $138,000 per month. Now tell me why they would want you too subscribe! You might make a few bucks on your $50 account, now compare that too $138,000 monthly without having to trade. Fortunately for a you a few people on here can actually fathom these shills out.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
You seem like a relatively reasonable person Ferna. However, how you have missed the obvious is quite beyond me. By that I mean HOW could you EVER " sneak up" on ryuryu's Discord Channel where he is "apparently" making selling a subscription to a DELTA indicator available through another site lol and all ... before ryuryu came onto this new thread about " coincidentely" discussing DELTA lol and then ryuryu posting this piece of absolute vile invective https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14330704 on the OPs VERY FIRST PAGE of his new thread WHEN You cannot ever sneak up LOLOLOL on ryuryu's Discord Channel as you have ASK HIM VIA AN FF PRIVATE MESSAGE first to be .... INVITED . If you value ryuryu as a friend you can CLEAR his name immediately from what you misread as random attacks on ryuryu by certain posters (as for some reason ryuryu seems to avoid and deflect from all questions about a Commercial Status for himself) YOU can help ryuryu here, do you not understand ? There are none so blind as they who will not see. Trade well, ferna

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Next you will never calculate the delta - the difference between buys and sells, because there are no data for that. This is exactly what I was talking about. your delta indicator can't calculate delta (Ask-Bid) because TV does not have such data, there is only the total volume per candle. It is possible to request the data of 1s candles. That's why 1 minute chart can have different color candle on your "delta" Thanks for finally admitting it, dumb scammer. Does anyone know ryry TradingView nickname?

Guys, It's clear there are two warring factions, please take your beef back to your base or open a new thread. It is looking like, there was no traction and very few takers for your previous posts {both groups} and that you had to hijack a thread. Have some courtesy and respect for your fellow ff members{in this case, the OP} Thanks

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hey all, my apologies for being inactive this past trading week. I've had to focus my time on the home front. I'm glad this thread is blowing up with discussion, I just wish the discussion would be more on how to make money with this strategy instead of personal beef between traders. As said earlier I will not dislike or ignore members here, since I'm a big fan of not censoring / freedom of speech. In between the fighting here there's been some traders giving positive feedback and shared valuable information on the topic and I like that. It shows that this cumulative delta volume is something many traders are interested in and by sharing thoughts on the theory we might all get wiser, so thank you for contributions so far. In the further course of this thread I hope traders will share some trades based on this method so we once in for all can conclude if this is an edge or not. Back testing / looking back in hindsight is one thing, but live forward trading is what needed to prove this. I meant to do this this week but got caught up with non trading situations. I've been called a lot of bad things in this thread and I'm trying not to be demotivated by it. I've spend a lot of time developing and sharing this all for free with no bad intentions to sell anything. It's fair if people don't like this system, but the poll shows support for this idea so let's work forward with this hope and motivation. The main goal of this thread is to help other traders make a profit and maybe develop something even better together. Hopefully I will be back at my screens live testing next week and for the traders who's been testing this throughout the week, feel free to share pros and cons in the thread. Also my bad for not replying to all thread posts and pm's lately, I will catch up on that. Happy weekend to all.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thank you for the answer Rick. Another question, since there is no true volume/DOM etc., in Forex, what if you had access to the order book? With that said, Oanda offers us B-book clients an order book that's updated, I believe, every 20 minutes. The order book is very generic and doesn't give you the precise number of pending orders at any given price but does show the distribution of buy and sell orders supposedly proportional to the number of actual orders. Since price moves from one liquidity pool to another, do you believe that this order book can be used as a proxy to what you guys are doing in stocks and Futures, albeit even with the 20-min delay?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Cheers Lekkim ! Well put discussion is good. Just some advice from a guy whose traded everything from stocks options warrants futures fx etc.... Ive used volume T&amp;S Level II to naked charts...to trading with hand drawn charts in the 80s etc etc... Been there done it. There is no one best way or best method. And anyone that tells you such a thing either has an agenda or is ignorant to that fact/inexperienced ..naive etc.... Trading is a highly personal performance based business. Your biggest challenge is you.. You are trading against you..your biggest enemy. I strongly believe and know volume and its derivitives can be very useful to a trader and I believe it is completely unneccessary for many successful traders as well. Same with indicators etc.... I know and have met so many profitable traders over the last 30+ yrs that trade from price alone no charts...to only candlesticks to one or two indis to volume and every other combo you can imagine.... Whats the common denominator ? The answer is The Person/The Trader.... You have to find a system a method that resonates with your personality(both timeframes and methods)... And dont listen to the guys who say that "this cant work or that cant work" because they cant make it work or cant see how that can work... My only ONE exception to this is Martingale money mgmt.... it will eventually catch you and burn you. It does not work long term period. Besides that I see no reason why you cant make what you have laid out work for you... Most traders just add and add layers of context that they need to know to try and find an edge...The edge is you first and foremost.. Not umpteen confluences...Its you pulling the trigger and managing yourself thru the trade. So DO NOT let the naysayers demotivate you... Fuck them and the horse they rode in on.. They are no one to you. This forum is ripe with the righteous my way is the only way members.... Screw them.. Because "when you know... you know" and when you really understand what that means you will have peace and confidence in your trading Now maybe I am rehashing a whole pile of things you already know and if so... Its always good to go back to the basics and understand the true nature of this business for a retail trader is the innner battle with yourself... YOU vs YOU.... I wish you all the best with YOUR way ! Blue

You / it called the top pretty well, it went down from there, hope you took the trade and it suggest more room to fall still towards green lines

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Each graph / picture calculates the candle tick volume of your current chart, so yes it will be changing a lot. Try to combine more data periods / timeframes or trade what you believe most in or what you are most comfortable with.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
This one was called well also, just for information, crosses like crypto including ETH/USD might not be traded a lot at your broker, so data can sometimes be vague compared to FX pairs.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I should get my behind to work and make and share this. It's a lot of work but a good way to compare and cancel out noise in between timeframes. Also it gives signal on all aud, nzd, cad, gbp, usd, chf and jpy regardless of the crosses and should give an overall view.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I've never communicated with ryuryu before I started this thread, so no feud. He made it clear this type of cumulative delta volume is of no worth, however we are many who believes metatrader tick data is valuable. Thanks for your comment of clarifying, Geester.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Glad I caught your interest. The delta approach in it self, is in my opinion such a great idea, the challenge is to find correct data to build the strategy on. I've had same thoughts for years, I tried delta approach in many other software's like, Bloomberg, Reuters and CME. This one in metatrader might not be perfect, but It's the closets I've come to valid data which can be accessible to all for free in popular MT5.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
You're welcome. I agree, It's so different from many other systems who are mostly based on technical indicators of price. I will share some more charts to help you understand my suggestions of trade entries.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hindsight m1 trades of yesterday with black lines showing optimal entries:

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Same with m5 timeframe on this week, I will not put black entries lines anymore, I hope you get the point. Buy when red price lines makes larger move away from green volume lines and when to close it is up to you. I suggest you do it in profit or at least closes when gap closes and red price touches green volume again.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry you asking RickM, but I can answer too. The orderbook contains "wishes". It is not full liquidity, because the orders can be removed immediately (and because 90% of orders are from the big player - that's how he knows the real liquidity). It is "I want to buy at" and "I want to sell at". But it is very useful if you want to determine the walls. Because if you are in profit and face the wall then better to exit then wait for it to be eaten (because in most cases it will not and the price will bounce back to loss. So in this case 20 min lag of orderbook data looks like a joke.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
It sure is. No It's much more fluid. No rules of tops and bottoms just looking for red price divergence where ever it can be found.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Haha yeah, I guess using that word is only for the brave. Thanks for reminding posters to keep a nice tone and stay thread relevant and yes that article was interesting. Don't worry I'm not giving up so easily and will continue posting, this thread will prosper never the less the fighting, just read through it. Also even in between the fighting there's been some valuable information and opinions shared.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I've tested trading it on crossovers, but I found no edge in that way. The cross of red price and green volume is only useful when closing trades.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks, I agree. It's disrespectful to call thread opener scammer and liar on first page, hope it will not drive other traders away. We all want green pips, let's not get hot tempered or letting our big egos take over discussion.

Hi davelansing I'll give you my opinion about liquidity then talk about Lekkim's use of the Cumulative Delta Indy. If you had to ask me about the one trader who understood how to trade the order book, its Navinder Singh Sarao. He's the guy that got blamed for the 2010 flash crash of the US equities markets by trading the E Mini S&amp;P Futures out of a bedroom in a London flat. He was of course a thief as he was spoofing the order books with 800 lot size trades 4 to 5 ticks above price then he was shorting heavily on an lopsided order book for massive profits. We are talking around 70 million pounds over a few short years, quite incredible. Now if we had ever decided to look at the E mini order book during this time, you and me would have seen his orders and both of us could have taken advantage ourselves as well. BUT NO ONE WAS LOOKING BUT I AM LOOKING NOW Now you know what I am looking for now every day on the S&amp;P order book - there is no need to for us to be dishonest because we can just sit on the S&amp;P looking for unusual activity and trade against it WITH AGGRESSIVE. Ryuryu in his last post was just talking about general liquidity often being fake which it is, but unusual orders are different and do have meaning. We just have to understand what it means. 101 liquidity trading is that price attacks the direction with the most liquidity = Sellers enter in numbers means price turns bullish. The other issue Navinder was really pissed off with was the HFT algo's destroying the readability of the books and the threat those HFT machines may jump up and close his massive orders causing him to lose millions in a second. He was using an Algo himself on TT platform to move his orders away from these Algo's - but sometimes they got caught. What a shame lOL FOR THE RECORD - I DO NOT SPOOF BUT DO ACT LIKE A MARKET MAKER AT TIMES Back to Lekkim's strategy which is interesting. The way I see it is the Cumulative Delta Indy used on Tick volume via MT4/5 may just be useful, actually it may work well for one reason. If you find a professional Order flow trader (other than me) and ask him / her about Cum delta, they will probably tell you the success of this indicator is not using it to establish direction, rather they use it to establish TRADER PARTICIPATION. What I am saying is when the Cum indy is flat or only on a shallow trend = DO NOT TRADE. The reason is we need traders to enter in big numbers to trade, not watch. Tick volume may actually be a good guide to Trader Participation so if we add the Cumulative Delta indicator to start moving up or down while tick volume is increasing, that's " a shit lot of traders are acting" = we should trading similar to Lekkims strategy. Direction of the Cumulative Indicator isn't important, only that its moving up or down is . Time to get back in my box and shut up.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
If you don't day trade and don't have all day to analyze charts, I may suggest you use higher timeframes for example D1 (daily) A stress free method where you, if you get the timing right, can profit from larger movements. Here's some graphs of strong signals on daily fx pairs:

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Cumulative delta indicator make sense only if you can mark start point of calculations. And of course it is not usable with tick data, only with real data. It is extremely useful to calculate the imbalance and amount of stops around. Cumulative continuous delta indicators literally shows nothing but candle size. And of course cumulative delta of market with sessions and weekends has too much noize too. You can use ATR or CCI it will show exactly the same. If you want to check if your delta inficator is correct and the data is correct check the colors of candles and colors on your indi. If they are the same - you have fake data and fake indicator. If they are different then it is good data and real indi.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
My view is other than your. For example EURNZD. What must change in settings ?

Thank you for the examples. By the way, how do you handle DD such as the one shown below? Adding up more positions? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
this something like reverse move of over stretched price

--- 帖子 #135 ---
price tend to move with in a trend when going into a certain direction. however, over liquidity might force price move ahead of trend and this indicator might indicate that over stretched price moves where it will correct soon

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I agree with ryuryu about what data you use and the delay. Anything with 20 min lag delay I can't think of a way to profit from this. When shit hit's the fan at news events and high volatility, you have to have real time data. Also I spend my time looking at various order books, also futures and CME and Bookmap and I might miss something, but I could not find a trading edge in looking at liquidity and buy and sell order walls etc. But let me know if you found something valuable to share.

After looking at your attached picture, you should close your market watch and navigator in your metatrader and make it full screen, the chart is longer (wider) in my chart. If any differences left after that, It's because of difference in my and your broker data.

As I mentioned in first post of this thread: 'Trade the difference if both gap but most importantly the ratio of difference is big, for example if red price makes a move at least double in size, the bigger the difference the better trading opportunity. When red price makes significant move or gap both more volatile and higher ratio difference and lines below green, buy. When red price makes significant move or gap both more volatile and higher ratio difference and lines above green, sell. The bigger the ratio and length of difference, the higher probability of profitability' So yeah, I would wait for difference to get as big as possible. If I was already in a position and the drawdown continued I would stand my ground or add more positions.

ooo fuck , this is big problem, i use icmarkets so top broker. I can check other company, give me name your broker,

--- 帖子 #144 ---
No, It's not a problem. I've compared many brokers and overall the data is the same, of course with some differences. But that's also why I wrote in first post, that comparing many brokers would give confirmation on trades. I personally have 5 different brokers loaded with this template. So whenever I do a trade I compare them all to get most valid data. Also it does not matter if It's a demo account or real account, the data will be the same. So if you want to take this strategy to the next level you download metatrader 5 from various brokers, set up demo accounts on them all and compare. In regards to these minor 'challenges' I think I've overcome them all. Actually as a 'pro tip' I can recommend you a software that let's you overlay many different mt5 windows, this makes for the quickest comparison. What broker I use is irrelevant, but if you want to know send me a private message (I'm not here to recommend brokers)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
WindowTop: https://windowtop.info/ You can compare different broker data manually by clicking from one tap / window to another or you can use this free app. It makes you overlay different screens and makes you change visibility / opacity. For example if you want to overlay 3 brokers, you set one window to 100%, second to 50% and third to 33%. This is a pro tip and it not really needed but if you are a perfectionist this will give you some satisfaction.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
ok, i understand your metodology, but my view is very different than your. I think that is not normal. Ok , i waiting for private message. I want a picture like yours, so the name of the broker is enough for me.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I was just lookin such tool, thanks mate

--- 帖子 #148 ---
That's awesome. My pleasure mate, happy to help.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Ooh something new here. In addition to correct trader mood, psychology and colored lines now we have dimensions... Oookkaaayyy. This is the problem of 99% traders here. You can't explain things and at the same time you have a strong believe in nonsense. Again: market orders move the price. Trend is the result of the movement. This way only and there are no other options.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Okay- Market orders move the market. What is it you are trying to say? What exactly is your beef with the thread starter?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
What you mean "okay"? Like I said that 2+2=4 and you said "okay"? It is not okay, it is basics. If you don't know the basics and post the bullshit like that guy (nonsense about dimensions, trends and so on) that mean there is nothing to discuss with you. Same as you said "okay", but it is not okay. If you registered since 2015 and still don't know the basics it is not "okay". Okay if you said "yes, market orders move the market". That will be okay. So please if you have nothing to say then keep your forex fairy tales in silence. I know them all and no need to repeat that bullshit again and again. For slow guys I can repeat: Forex has no orderflow data, so in is impossible to use volume indicators (delta, cumulative delta and so on). All this indicators are useless and show anything but not the cumulative delta of the volume. Also cumulative volume delta make no sense on markets with sessions and weekends. Because of data corruption. What I mean. Check the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It make sense so calculate cumulative delta inside the green block. And inside the blue block. But NOT inside the red. Understood? BTW: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Delta volume February 2023 stats. Stay green!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You actually think Forex has no volume data????????? I think you need to correct and update your fundamental knowledge about forex. In this day and age to say, Forex does not have volume data is such a blunder. Please check this, https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/CLSRV/overview Attached Image (click to enlarge) FX volume data from clearing houses. Henceforth, I don't know how anyone can take anything you say seriously.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Yeah, thanks for your input Ryan, and that is what I thought as well... the 20 min lag is a killer for lower time frame trading. With that said, I did take screenshots of the Order Book (OB) for EURUSD on an hourly basis from 4:00am EST to 10:00pm EST on several different days, and it was remarkable to me that the distribution of Buy and Sell pending orders didn't seem to change all that much from one 20-min update to another. Almost as if the pending orders, that weren't actually triggered by price, were relatively stable. But the large order blocks on the sell side seemed to slow/stop the upward movement of price, whereas the large order blocks on the buy side seemed to slow/stop the downward direction of price (albeit this was only observations over the course of three days - not much data to support any definitive hypothesis of using pending orders as a proxy for liquidity and subsequent price directionality).

--- 帖子 #154 ---
The reality is this: you're only seeing the data in the Futures market that makes at best 33% But you have no order flow data or Cumulative Delta of the other 66% - the Cash market (no data available) - the Options market Therefore the whole order flow and Cumulative Delta idea is pretty much flawed.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Orderbook is a list of limit orders higher and lower the current price. Limit orders higher the current price are asks, lower are bids. The orderbook data can be used to determine the walls. It is very useful when you are in profit, but you hit the wall. Then better exit. And here the orderbook data will help you too. Because it is highly recommended to calculate if there is enough orders in the orderbook to fill your market exit (not to bring you back to the loss area). Both methods are useless with a lag. So I don't see any purpose to use orderbook data with lag. You can then draw random orderbook and look at it, the results will be the same. So I just don't know what to discuss here. Data is data. Or you have it and can you, or you don't have it so it is not usable then.

Ryuryu Again a bunch of nonsense. Refer to my previous post where I proved that your very fx foundations are wrong. This post also contains misinformation. It's looking like you are copy pasting some page of an old book you read. Not nice to misguide people on their forex journey.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Yes, I have observed this myself regarding ryuryu in real time over the past 1½ years, as he was misinforming forex currency traders over on The Dutchman Thread. ryuryu as I saw it (so just in my opinion) has no understanding of forex, no understanding of chart reading &amp; oberservation or even basic market behaviour concepts. But it is good at least to see him learning something &amp; now implementing Horizontal Lines (ie price) onto his OWN charts. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14338569 ryuryu once made ridiculous comments about these basic core components exposing his limited forex currency understanding of price &amp; the larger markets targets. And as regards to paying for something trading related from ryuryu. All I could say in my own opinion is. Caveat Emptor Buyer Beware and do your Due Diligence. Trade well folks.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
ps, so sorry AGAIN Lekkim, but it has to be said, misinformation must always be called out imho else those reading ryuryu afterwards may assume it was factual, when it wasn't

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Pete You never heard about CLS and the services it offers till now, so stop looking for an angle to have a shot at Ryuryu - your'e better than that. The service CLS offers is a volume report send to a trader during the intraday period or at the end of day. It is not useful if you need to trade in the next 5 seconds, 5 minutes or 50 minutes as the information is already old. Ryuryu and myself are trading Bids &amp; Asks which are only seen under the 1 minute time frame. Volume information that's older than 1 hour is totally useless, the information has already shifted, liquidity has shifted and trading off old data is no different that trading off some time lagging indicators. Its no advantage in my eyes so they came up with some bullshit themselves. They develop an algo that likes to guess and called them alternative forecasting algorithms. So they like to guess Again, why are you so interested in Ryuryu's work when you can't be bothered to actually look at what ryuryu is actually doing - its bloody good stuff.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
CLS Models As you can see here in their forecasting models they also use, not even close. Ryuryu and myself can afford to have no error in the data we receive and it has to be updated to 1/10th of a second. Futures data does that, FX data doesn't and old, very old

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Rick, While I do see you as well researched &amp; informed on your own topics, you will also realise that I know you quite often jump the gun as you have done before , and then misread or misunderstand the subject at hand. I ask myself, why not just PROMOTE ryuryu’s Sales Pitch over on his own thread about delta. To do this here on Lekkim's new thread - also on delta - stinks of poor business ethics to me, sorry. Look I suggest we ALL …. stop this on Lekkim’s thread . If you can ask ryuryu to UN-BAN me from his own thread so I may post there and then open up THIS discussion there I will come over there to ryuryu's thread and post my thoughts to ryuryu, yourself &amp; your merry band of followers on, what I think about ryuryu’s sum knowledge on Forex Currency Trading . Let’s move these intrusions please over to ryuryu’s own thread, if he is willing. This thread here of Lekkims is brand new and I see it is interesting, informative and things have already been fleshed out that I see as a benefit to many. You ask why I post about ryuryu. Well thankfully I have not had to interact with ryuryu for ages now, and wouldn't have. UNTIL. It was brought to my attention, firstly, that he is likely a Hidden Commercial member, and AFTER that the good man Lekkim went &amp; ‘shouted’ good words towards me over on my Home Page so I looked again at what Lekkim was currenrtly doing in Forex Currencies (&amp; Delta I saw) and while reading Lekkim's .... VERY FIRST PAGE .... on his .... NEW .... thread, guess what i saw the grub (imho) ryuryu referring to the OP as a cheat, liar &amp; scammer You may have missed ryuryu’s vile post Rick , here it is again to refresh your memory (on the FIRST bloody page ffs) https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post14330704 So Le’s do all this OUT IN THE OPEN please you, ryuryu and ALL your followers over there on ryuryu’s thread and see where it goes. Lets talk Forex Currencies on ryuryu's thread, NOT HERE

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ryuryu has not brought up his indicators on this thread. It is everyone else who is doing that and accusing him afterwards. Please stop derailing the thread.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi B, NONE SO BLIND. Ask yourself in a quiet moment of reflection, what is ryuryu's indicator about (clue ... delta) Then have a quick look again at the heading of Lekkim's new thread (clue ... delta) rudy did NOT have to bring it up any part-time detective could have put two and two together apparently some can't oh, well trade on (EDIT: ps brandon, see you over at ryuryu's thread when he un-bans me and let's get to the core of it)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Pete Ha Ha ..... yes I did miss that post from Ryuryu I have said it many times that Ryuryu can be a pain in the butt at times, rude and also arrogant. But when you get to trade with the guy for a while, you will find he's compassionate, very helpful and an incredibly creative trader who can rack up some incredible profits without any effort. If you want Ryuryu to become a nice guy, it would effect his capacity to be as profitable as he is now, he would fail. So I encourage Ryuryu to be himself and never let anyone change his mannerism, let him be an pain in the arse because he's a better trader because of it. You guys can carry on hating him, he won't care. On a side note, I actually like your work and read most of your posts - keep them coming (not keen on coloured lines but pay no attention to me). Last post here I think for me, unless its of value to this thread. Cheers

--- 帖子 #165 ---
ryuryu's using CME Futures data. Lekkim's using tick data from forex brokers. i know which is more accurate.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi Rick, Cheers, you too pal. And you also know we have all been down THIS VERY SAME PATH BEFORE (brandon will not know all this - yet). Maybe put ryuryu on a leash &amp; muzzle (just j/k'ing ) and then maybe NEW THREADS that counteract directly what ryuryu is selling might get a chance to get off the ground all the best rick

--- 帖子 #167 ---

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Once a trader broadens their awareness, that's when they grow up. Cum delta can be traded just as well as tick data. I know I've done it .... but I see MANY who try to covet and endorse one or the other, just to hide their inabilities or insecurities. After all, this IS a public website. Any dickhead with typing skills can create an account. Hehehe. The person is the wild card never the data. Once each person here's been trading for long enough, with REAL experience under their belt, then many things like that make sense. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Gold !

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Yeah you can say it and say it and say it. People are NOT dumb. They just listen to segmented fragmented bullshit. How the hell do they feed themselves each day if they cannot function?! As for ryu and Rick etc. they'll grow up, They'll HAVE TO otherwise Life'll kick 'em in the nethers and try and wake 'em up to themself. One simply cannot truly appreciate a real learning space while making a B-line for these sites etc every time you hit a wall or it gets hard (booohooo!!). Begin a schematic and make lots of room for expansion. THAT is how you learn. I used to love using cum data in its raw form and still do use some. But people have got their heads screwed backwards. If I tried to explain how I do it, people would just walk out. Hehehe. If only they'd sit with bloomberg or other nat sites that offer treasuries or cross asset discussion, people will learn something. Hehehehe. Sorry Lekkim for butting in.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Just as a side tip here ..... Delta is a process of processes so it works best when detailed as a [from-&gt;to-&gt;for-&gt;from] overlay. With a constant correlation to - time, use and who. If you choose to understand this process then you can trade options WITH currencies WITH any futures deal AND FX spot covers all of your costs. Even throw in some energies eg. Oil or a healthy Stock Index for good measure if it fits. Of course learn what you need to know and do with each one beforehand. But that chain is great for balancing exposure while accelerating your performance : cost ratio. Most people are far too 1 or 2 dimensional in their thinking. FX .... why was it created? What is it used for? Put aside the "stories" and see what society likes and dislikes. Then compare this to its needs. Now you know and understand more than most try to. Cheers. Peter

--- 帖子 #174 ---
BRAVO !!! SPOT ON !!!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi Peter As you are an expert using Cumulative Delta, please enlighten Lekkim, me and other readers here just how a professional trader would use it. Now is the your time, lets see if you understand the mathematics of this indicator and how you use it in its raw form (does he trade naked or something?) Peter - explain it to us now

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I think it is not correct to discuss what is better real orderflow or tick data until some will bring us the full description what tick data is , how it created, what are the rules, how it is audited and so on. As I see here in the thread there are a lot of gurus claiming they know how market works. So let's listen to them. (I know that this will not happen and guys like TimeTells will start writing long posts again for nothing, just to hide the fact of lack of knowledge and move the topic in another direction.) And if there will be no description found then I'll kindly ask them to shut the f**k up and never open their lying mouths anymore. As for me I know that tick data is fake and scam. The only purpose of it is to draw candles for gamblers thinking they can outperform casino using drawing tools. I know it's hard to admit that everything you know is a lie, especially if you registered here 10 years ago. Because many people may think that you are stupid. But, guys, find the courage and admit that you are just gamblers, and have absolutely no idea how the market works. p.s. this is not about Lekkim and his thread, because he is trying to research this thing. This is about stupid scammers who know nothing and only post blah-blah-blah. We know names. I'll edit this post adding username and count the bullshit that username posted instead of posting the answer for my direct question. 1. moodybot - 1 2. aaven - 1 3. PeterCaleb - 1

--- 帖子 #177 ---
The best thing you can do is to open your thread up so that TimeTells can reply to your challenge, unless of course you’re bullshitting and to frightened to. Edit. Or I’ll open my thread up to you. So what’s it to be, your thread or mine?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Ryu, It is my understanding that most of them who has spent some time in learning FX/using MT4 is aware that the "volume" information available in MT4 is tick data/so called "volume" from the said broker. Lekkim never claimed otherwise nor did he say what he uses is superior to order flow methodology. He is sharing what worked for him. There is a proverb where i come from which roughly translates to this: There are a group of people and they find out that the cake which was supposed to be there is missing. They exclaim" there must be a thief", so one of the guys immediately takes out a napkin and wipes the crumbs from his mouth. For some reason Lekkim opening a thread, the kind of reaction you gave as if he attacked your trading methodology. The so called debate/discussion that you want between real orderflow or tick data is just your insecurity showing up and wanting to show what you trade is superior to what Lekkim does.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I'm not threatened nor impressed by people trying to goad me into giving them what they want or feel entitled to. The sheer CHOSEN stupidity of people trying to be lazy and swindle real knowledge out of people is astounding. My input comes from years of trading. A fact not chest pumping. My knowledge speaks for itself. "Data traders" are the new fad. That is all. Trading is about adapting, learning and bending some more to then come to rest at the beginning again. Most of the cock arsed stuff people on here talk about is silly. To have "one golden goose" is a silly and misguided way to view the world. My above input is, as it says, for those who wish to understand this process. Now here's the catch, IF, you, the person do NOT understand the markets, then guess what, of course you will spit chips!! You've used up all your time to 'carry-on-laughing' (for anyone who gets the pun) on these sites instead of actually learning. For people who say they trade something - crypto, stocks, fx etc ..... c delta AS A RULE, is formed BECAUSE OF "X". It is not the cause. It is the effect in transit !!!! (THAT last word is key.) As is tick data, cross matched with Bonds, specific stock formats and on and on we go. WOOOW !!! So is it the lazy or stupid box that people always tick (hahaha) when approaching this stuff? Experts .... smexperts. Grow a backbone and stop being suckerfish. Therefore dear Rick, cannot teach you something you refuse to acknowledge exists. Been there with you before, done that and still found you wanting. You seem to think you and your kin are the first "......" - fill in the blank and seem to forget Life was already happening when you were born. That is your attitude and it seems to precede people like you. I would deal with that before anything else. I also see so many people trying to talk about other things they don't really understand. My oh my people looove to waste time. You chose deltas and data and forgot the real world. Who's fault ? Yours. Whose responsibility? Yeah, yours. So EVERYTHING that all these "people" claim, is "trading" is merely an attempt to arrest real life. Can't be down. The faster you all stop bitching and bickering, the faster someone learns. WOW !! Wouldn't THAT be a revelation. Everything has a relationship. End of story. (Again so sorry Lekkim). IF you choose to understand the process I described above, your c Delta work will go miles beyond "these people". It's all there in what I wrote. Use it or don't. Learn or don't learn. "Thanks for coming. I will NOT be here all week. Hihihihehehe" Peter

Ryu, Since i pointed out that your knowledge of forex was lacking, i am a scammer? Please stop the childish behavior of making up false stuff and lying.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
The answer has come through from the protagonist himself and posted in his own thread! ----- Announcement ----- I don't want to write anything in other topics anymore and teach anyone. I don't understand at all how you can trade for 10-15 years and not know absolutely nothing about volumes or how the market works. I don't believe this is possible. This is either a special kind of idiocy, or a banal scam. In any case, I do not want to participate in this and advertise these scammers with my participation. ----- Announcement ----- So I will post only in this thread, if you want to discuss volume delta approach please you are all welcome! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ So basically he's been put back in his box!!

Yes, maybe consider lowering your leverage by half each time you double the account? To be able to move over to using prop firm money, it may be best to get the risk per trade all the way down to 1% due to their risk management rules and trying to stay as far away from losing the account(s) as possible based on NOT maxing out their "allowed" risk and hitting their drawdowns/max loss per day/max loss per high water mark. If you hit the max they close the account and you have to start over. Don't worry that 1% seems like nothing on a small account because when you're trading hundreds of thousands or millions of prop firm $, it's a lot! The goal is to learn how to trade within their parameters now so you can make huge money on their huge account size later. The goal is NOT to make huge money on a small personal account. 1% on a 1 million dollar account is $10,000. I think most traders can live off of making that much just on 1 trade a month!!! Think future big account, not now little account.

I've had the time of my life today with my profitable trading. No matter where this end, never give up on your dreams. Green pips for all, love Lekkim. Don't let anybody take away your dream.

Take a look at this, it's showing great signals. trading view indicator is called Cumulative Volume Delta. I changed histogram to a line and added a horizontal line at 50 level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) buy: line is below 50 and angled downward and is red like it is in screen shot. line then spikes up crossing 50, bigger cross bigger move. take a position once candle closes. this is a great way to determine CVD spiks which are awesome times to jump in. I'll keep posting some examples

In the old days you had two choices ..... either trade the edge or play with its push through. What's changed? NOTHING. Most of the deadhead talk on these sites is about running away from your personal responsibility --- you are a person placing orders with the vendors so know where 'it and you' are and then it either goes to a comfortable profit or, you simply reverse with it and go with it. How do you think larger entities trade and profit? "Oh my piddly little 2% value stop loss just got hit.....Oh no.' WHAT??!! You mean you make profit even IF it turns against you ?!! God forbid we do that !!! Hehehe. Just be an adult Lekkim and take responsibility. And stop listening to the children talk from little to no experience. So sorry "people" but you really don't know what the hell you're talking about, beyond how you choose to see things. One ht wonders are for idiots..... or practice traders. Sorry if people don't agree but reality is reality and your dear chart shows what happens in every possible scenario. Have fun.

take a look at pic i think we can learn from this style, its strong

I don't know what does the indicator inventor " Evgeny Shevtsov " do to make this work because there is no available live bid/ask volume for forex. I guess is some kind of mathematical transformation. This is my version of cumulative delta. The method of using it is just like how traders trade cumulative delta on futures market.

Here's another interesting thing about C Delta work Lekkim ......... once you understand it beyond what average people choose to, you can also see how unnecessary it is to subscribe to "people" on these silly sites. Most on these sites assume they can think, so they also assume they understand Deltas etc. .... because joe blo (who gives a shit what his name is) said this and that. Using Deltas requires insight and understanding of something NOT on the chart. It's the same with "subscribing" on social media sites. People just do certain things without thinking, or pausing at least, to consider why they have to do it at all. You find the same attitude and behavior all over this site. I know there are lots of personas on here that HATE what I say and that's GREAT. It shows them up for the dickheads they are and also shows people that they should avoid them and everything they say at all costs. Why? Toxic knowledge is tainted by the person's lessor knowledge. C Delta work is the same. Idiots read an indicator or presume to know things but their knowledge is limited so cannot learn. Good fortune to you with efforts using C Delta. I hope you continue to learn. Peter

Peter What was the point of your post? If you trade off Cumulative Delta, then you have to trust what it tells you and use it as required. Your’e saying I think that Cumulative Delta is only a tool that is secondary to other stuff you use. What the hell that would be be, no body on FF has a bloody clue, nor do you I feel. So why are you here, is there a in town and the clowns are on a night out

I'm happy for everyone's success, but if I understand correctly there is no SL. or any protection.

Lekkim Just a head's up: You traded live in front of everyone, doubled an account in a day and traded without any stop loss. Matter of time before people will take their pitchforks and root for your failure and raring to say "i told you so". Do what works for you. In my opinion the only metric that is indicative of trading success is $, people are so caught up with their process that they miss the fundamental point to check it makes money or not. Good luck with the journey and don't take any pressure to convince the naysayers, they will not be convinced and already made up their mind.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Well .... you see Ricky, out there ... beyond your cozy chair is a big wide world. C Delta is not new. Been around since way back. although the tech is new. But what you people clearly haven't learned, is ....... an indicator can house ANY data you wish it to. If you don't know how to do this then there are plenty of coders around who may assist. For me I am a no bullshit person. The stuff I have learned may (and does) go over some people's heads but that doesn't invalidate its necessity or importance. How do I use C Delta? Future -&gt; Present -&gt; Past. Any idiot can look back on a price chart and see lots of things. But someone who sees that if you're gonna put hrs or months or years into trading, why f around with superficial bullshit that everyone does or tries to force it to become superman for 'em. For me, I look at the higher 'food chain' of circulation. That is where you see the moving and shaking. A price chart and any variant of it ie extra indicators, are the bottom of the food chain. I've been over this many times. People who control or move money DO NOT speculate. They can't afford to. If they did. countries would cease to exist and anarchy would ensue. And you see where that takes everything. The hardest thing about C Delta use is not being consumed by old bad habits of "price chart trading" even with external info. So for me I correlate it to treasuries, energy and Future of primary productions. Why? Because the biggest commodity on this planet is not money but people. I don't use broker data alone as generally, its only and main use is to tell me what I'll be paid for using that broker. That's all. Your mate ryu and you and others don't correspond HOW Accumulation details relate to your process. Therefore you're all out of touch with real life and therefore, money transfer/transmission and circulation. (Kinda important since you are trying to 'make money') So that previous post I wrote for Lekkim, describing the flow process is right in synch with what was is and will be and when. But if a person is set on being a lazy shit then forget it. It's adult work, not suitable for play-schoolers or tire kickers. But most of what gets written about all this stuff on these sites is too close to just being so-called "fundamental analysis" and because most people have no business or economics background they dismiss it all as "too hard' and then justify that decision as "it's not needed" I know that you Rick and others are always fishing for info and insight etc. There you go. Other than actually doing your research and work for you, the rest is up to you. So while y'all are obsessing over fascinating indicators etc, and other silly debates, you could be learning about real life. Peter

Hi Peter Somewhere in your post is some gems, maybe valuable information as well. But can you repost your comments after cutting all the crap and personal put downs and rambling crap so we can see cleary what the hell your on about. I think what your’e trying to say is you trade human opinions that agree with central banks?. Is that close? Help us untangle your rambles for once

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hey, There are a lot of explanation in the comment from author of this indicator, hope it help: In CumDelta mode - the cumulative delta curve is cumulative, from left to right, starting from zero, and starting from the first candle that is visible in the chart window (on the left border of the chart window), or starting from the candle that is set in the input variable BarsLimit.

Hey Lekkim, great thread and great to see you smashing it! You have such a great mindset around this business , keep it up, all the best!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi Lekkim, Well congrats , good sir. Regardless from now onwards, your journey here has opened the eyes of many, I would imagine, as to how the 90% correlation of forex tick-data to CME vol data (cheers rosalieone &amp; Mr Brown) which can be UTILISED in an imaginative way (C-delta) by a currency trader to trade the forex markets. The FX markets allow scaleability of trade size and trade entry times that other mediums such as the newly emerging crypto markets just do NOT. The lack of continual volume in those other emerging markets makes forex (currencies) still a good safe medium it would seem to trade in. And you have shown, Lekkim, that with application excellent figures could be obtained. How lucky were we all here, on this thread, that a mindless early disruption combined with totally false accusations against Lekkim , that began on his very FIRST page, were put to bed quickly with the baseless intruder now announcing on his own thread that he will no longer perform such wasteful conduct on us all, of merely creating only disruption on other folks threads. So done, finished, thankfully. The caution NOW being expressed by posters in HOW Lekkim might conduct his continued trading levels I would imagine will be welcomed by him &amp; observers. While the main thing I get out of this interesting thread is how a Trader, such as Lekkim, with a strong personal belief coupled with strong application, can present something like we rarely get to see on FF threads. Well done Lekkim, seriously pal, you are a gem of a person imho. (and Trader lol). How it turns out now for you in this Lekkim will be ALL you , sir, and merely how you trade it all. The methodology you have shown does appear workable as you have PROVEN already in these early stages. The results you have openly shown on your stats page are end-point numbers only yes, but the methodology you have arranged &amp; combined with your own personal approach has been fascinating to say the least. all the best wishes, again.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Well done Lekkim !! As I told you don't let others place limitations on what you can or can't do with YOUR Data and YOUR method ! Whether you've made 0.5 50% 500% I could care less... What counts is dollars...that's what goes into the bank and gets spent or invested in dollars ...that's the bottomline line..not oh I made 800% this month or 37% today...that means nothing.. dollars anyday over percentages. Not many show or talk about what they actually.take from the markets...so kudos to you on several fronts ! Cheers Blue

First off, if you people wish to converse as adults then drop the immature attitude. I spend my days talking with adults not spoiled children etc. THIS is why I point out the things I do in the way I do. So WHO CARES what you think about human psych. It's real it works and if you don't apply it to yourself and your trading then you're no different to the ol' slot machine gamblers. Addicted lost and misled. THAT is why I have to say the things I do. I have get past YOUR bullshit FIRST, so then, MAYBE, we can have an adult discussion. So I don't know who you all are used to talking to but it's not adults. Next .... Rick .... time after time I have suggested to people to create a schematic of the world financial markets in the context of human society. IF you did that you wouldn't need to ask. The chain of money and people and the way they both interact. Central banks answer to someone and those elements answer to someone else. 'Money has a master' I suppose is a way to say it. For eg. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two I found quickly to offer egs. Not my work but provides insight into the layers. Cum Delta as an indicator only has closed data as its master. So there's no knowledge there only data. No not human opinions etc. ... what these elements on their layer think, organize then do. Thought, planning then action and the ripple effect that comes after. This is what keeps human society 'moving' or in a state of 'busy-ness'. If all activity stopped even for a week. society would fall into chaos, literally, not like some tv show etc. So it must have a process to keep it all moving. What most people do is trade on reactions, not what is coming. There's no "prediction", just observation and planning. You people watch too much tv and youtube stuff and do not see what is there. And that is why most people do not speak about these things. For you Rick, you think too much like a speculator trying to get something. But those layers are trying to operate and maintain, so they exist to keep the see-saw from tipping too far to the extreme. You have to ask yourself what are the pillars of society that money and money flow are built on? You don't have to read 2000 books and do a million hours of chart face time. Just use some basic common sense. What affects the top also affects the bottom. And vice versa. Treasuries energy and production. In ancient times a vault was called a "treasury". Why? And why has the name stuck? Who cares you ask. They care otherwise there would be a different word there. First clue. Energy and production... well, they should be self explanatory inline with society needing to keep moving. Treasuries harbor society's idea of safe worth. Energy and production are "useful". Now put them together. So if and when used inline with these things, C Delta can give important points of change that's real, not pretty charts or notions of what's "cool". Hayseed made an interesting note about trend following/trading .... that at the end of a trend, it does something different and it throws off his approach. Why? Even a price chart shows indication that something has changed if one looks properly, but that is not enough. Not for someone serious. And most people think it's all too messy or complicated. That's because again, you think as a speculator and do not go and search out the other pieces of the schematic. That's where the internet and libraries are very helpful. Proper Deltas are areas of significant change and this is where you get "accumulation and distribution", "supply and demand" etc etc. In options you can call it a zone.In spot fx you people have lots of names but have not looked at the real world effects. So reactions are the only option. Even with using Futures data or info or using a correlation effect of the futures with spot. Bad information paths lead to bad choices and poor results OVER TIME, which is the most important point. "From what I now know and understand, can I do this trading thing for the next 50yrs? Is what I do and how I do it, adaptable enough to weather the future?" People who think in terms of divergence convergence and inefficient zones of 'bad pricing' are ill-informed about Deltas. If you do not look at its process then yes you have a snapshot but everything else is lost. So you have two streams .... big picture and follow through. As I have said repeatedly. The job of the person with their money somewhere in these markets is to observe and understand the landscape and identify the PERILS so you can then do what is needed. Regardless of asset class or instrument. If you see your Deltas purge a level then you should know what that means. Not just "follow the momentum trail". If it's randomly setup just to capture specific moments then you should just use an on chart RSI histogram with the overly of tick data within the data within the actual indicator, because random setup approaches must fail over time, as it cannot weather several things out of your control eg. unavailability of specified data or changes to other parts that directly or worse, indirectly affect it usefulness, where the ill effects may not surface for several intervals or longer. So for me, I use technology to tell me future then present then past. And my data is set to attune my view for this. Similar to people seeing big order zones or small or if they disappear, however, micro-fathoms do not interest me. If I have say, X thousands of dollars (my own money not high leverage on loan) into something I don't want to panic or assume, I want to be ready to accelerate or revolve with it. Another way to say this ---- if you grab a chart and you place say 20 differing indicators on that chart and most are showing similar things despite their settings, and despite their 'custom build', then you have a serious problem to face and deal with. Is it the indicator or is it you? If it's either then something has to change. Price discovery is a good way to see what you don't understand. Notice I didn't say "know". Understanding it gives more opportunity to learn. Real discovery only occurs when a market "pauses". Why and How? "Money comes and money goes". Memorize it. While many will argue that market orders or over abundance of limits at extremes are what pushes a market etc, these are not what is happening. And if you watch a chart in real time for long enough the volume or tick or whatever data you are applying will contradict itself because people do not fully appreciate or understand "manipulation" therefore they are not looking at the holistic picture, they are seeking an "edge". It's backwards thinking. The flow of data does not start or finish with "orders" but with the before picture. It's like me asking you for your money before you have looked at what you're buying. Understand? When I trade options I don't use an "edge" (eeeewwww yuck) I use my understanding of money flowing from one opportunity site/zone/scenario/situation to another. Why? Because Risk On and Off is a revolving door. It HAS TO BE when you have Deltas and price movement in the same room. Take one away and it stalls. Restrict one and the other stalls. Understand? Why is it that Deltas can offer insight into two separate trade setups on totally different exchanges and timezones, and instruments, while maintaining their differential (the overall distance away from/close to each other inline with how they affect each other)? Correlation of active movement. "Positive/Negative correlation" is no different to using tick data and calling it "orderflow" without the disclaimer = this is not based on orders but transactional assumptive conclusions. The assumption of what this means must be made here otherwise you dress it up as something it's not. People who bitch about tick data being "fake" etc need to grow up. The broker has a legal responsibility to "offer" / "provide" " enough " access to someone because they are not a fully licensed vendor .... ie. cannot and do not offer a full service of industry training to clients (generally). Therefore it falls on the trader/investor to fill this gap. They are merely doing what the "rules/laws" allow them to .... until they're not of course. So stop the bitching children about ticks. Learn to use it properly or don't use it. Simple choice I think. Cross exchange data with Delta must be anchored otherwise blindspots occur. I anchor mine to the real world but not "economic news" etc. That's really just noise. I use 2 streams as mentioned before because this keeps me grounded. But you may choose to only use one. But I wouldn't suggest it. It "hurts" to spend time energy building accounts to then see them bottom out then have to rebuild. As I've said before, my way and setup is for me. Over several years to set up. But a schematic is essential as a minimum. If all this helps then good. If you "disagree" etc, oh well, maybe next time. Peter

Good job Lekkim. I would give you advice tho, do something with the drawdown. EURJPY trade had 98 pips drawdown, this is bad. I believe you have nice approach that works for you, but the drawdown might catch you in future. Use some kind of filter. :o) Anyway good job, will watch You.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Oh no !! Not Drawdown. Why don't you just learn to trade your damn drawdown. Put two feet on the ground and ..... JUST DO IT ! ...... NIKE ....... oh shoot ! NO!!!! ...... Peter .... Hehehehehe. Drawdown is not evil stuff. It's usable. Peter PS - Trending now is the act of trading both ways. But wait, there's more !!!!! With every direction you choose, you get a free set of gold steak knives. So you can feel a million bucks when it turns on you and it comes to getcha !!! Hehehehe Seriously people, stop listening to faceless nobodies. Pay attention. Learning isn't that hard. Just stop trying to do and go spend a few months digging into more than just moving averages or whatever. Research done thoroughly is priceless.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hey man, don't take bad what I will say now. However... I know it's doable. But honestly I'm too lazy to do this. I rather enter on good spot, zero drawdown (it's possible) than trying to fix losing trade in minus 98 pips. It's difficult for newbies specially. So I agree with you, but you must understand my point. Even Lekkim lost 1000 dollars thanks to losing trades. Exactly as said. I'm not "faceless nobody" here who says BS. I tripled the acc on one pair within a week, so I know what I'm saying. And no, I picked good entries, instead of "fixing" bad trades. It's much easier, at least for me. I simply hate floating loss of thousand of dollars for X days or weeks. I rather open a trade and close it in profit after 15 minutes than waiting and managing loss. SF

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Sooo .... it's not really laziness then is it. It's just down to you seeing "loss" but don't see "opportunity". There's the difference between trading and speculating in a nutshell. I wasn't picking on anyone. Congrats on the account. How 'bout we each buy a mars bar and shake on it? hihihihi. You see loss I see opportunity. I hope all you trend traders are watching.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Dear Peter, can you tell me where is the opportunity having 900 dollars floating loss? What's better. Opening buy trade and close it in 16 minutes with 265 eur profit, or the same trade but in loss since we open sell trade? If we talk about doubling the account, losing trades are just bad. This is for experienced traders, newcomers will make 1 mistake and they are done.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Draw downs are defined by several things... what you know and what you don't. What you understand and what you refuse to learn. You're thinking like a person who feels the need to be a perfectionist or be perfect within entry but you don't know why it gets filled. What is better is to know that drawdowns DO and WILL happen. Even with a stop level it won't always be 'honored' by said broker (for some reason). A floating loss must be put in context. Maybe experienced traders are not so experienced. If your position is entered, why? If this can be answered then it's not really a random loss is it. So one would have some idea of what happens when this happens. Ergo, its a temporary stage of the process. If a person just throws open orders anywhere without cause, then ok, take the credit card away NOW hehehe..... a strategy loses at times but that is due to poor understanding and is not to be blamed on probabilities or stats etc. That's merely the person relinquishing personal responsibility. Therefore it is inevitable that drawdown will occur. My way of doing things is - if you know that they will occur, find the weakness in your approach and fill the hole by strengthening the weaknesses. This is a more reasonable idea than expecting people to get a perfect 100% win SR on a semi or fully automated strategy process every single time.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
ok Peter, let me summarize in one sentence what you regurgitated in 300 words: "blablablablabla...drawdowns are inevitable, but it is preferable not to have them ...blablablabla." that's it! PS not yet crucial point, but you are slowly getting there...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I disagree that the drawdown has to be. My drawdown, when I trade, is between 1 and 5 pips. Not BS like 10+ pips. Doesn't matter what chart I use. I was doing it before, I'll do it in future like this. I simply hate this old thinking about everything. Drawdown happen and will happen ONLY if you don't know how to entry on better price. Of course I am not trying to be rude or anything. It just works for me, maybe having drawdown is not 100% thing.

I don't need to teach anything friend. Trading with stoploss like 3-5 pips is highly possible. Did you tried it? How can you say it does not work? I want to know your real opinion. Why it should not work. Im interested. It will only help me.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Nice job. I'm a little jealous, my average stop loss on forex is 16 pips on 1hr, 4hr, and Day chart signals, but only because I go down to the 1, 5, and 15 to find my best entry price. Because of where I place my stops, if I get stopped out, I reverse a lot of my losing trades (algo with my confirmation turns this on/off), get the loss back by closing half, then allow the rest to run. Works 90% of the time when I confirm yes; it ranges from getting 1x to 11x my loss. I only use the reversal during high volume times. When I have losses they are 2% of the account balance about 20% of the time, 1% of the account balance 40% of the time and break even 60% of the time. If it's a 2% loss it means the big $ has reversed and that's when I make the most on a reversal. If the loss is 1% then normally get to break even plus a little on the reversal. If it's break even then I don't do the reversal because the trade went in my direction enough to close half, but came back too much so it probably is the end of volume or is or will become a sideways channel.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Kind of agree with SilentFather. If we enter with precision, our drawdown need only be a few ticks ever. If we get our entry wrong, we just take a quick loss and save ourselves from misery. The stress of being in a large drawdown changes our character for the worst. My wife could pick the times years ago when I had a large position in a moderate size drawdown because I would become quiet and very grumpy. To say large drawdowns risked my relationship at times - it bloody consumes every thought you had making for an unpleasant RickM lol. So save your marriage and get out quick if the trades wrong Entering with precision for me requires ditching candlestick charts and just trading when you see masses on the wrong side of direction.

Already the spread is more than 2 pips

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I remember my broker from years ago. Markets.com where spread was like 3 or 4 pips. Those times lol. I'm not with ECN broker so I don't really have any spread. Its about preference. :o That is correct. But you will agree with me that being precise is sometimes really hard. I know this, it's just reality. But as PeterCaleb said, I'm perfectionist. That's it. Hello, no need to be jealous. That's normal. I started same. It's part of learning process. You will maybe want to change this in future, and you'll do it. It just takes time. I'm sure that if you would want this, you'll achieve it.

Literally most people I see on these dinky sites are told one thing to do with capital preservation while real life is not like that. If you have not experienced different brokerage types, then it's hard to explain without the morons coming out of the woodwork to "disagree". I never spoke about possible. I was talking about people lacking the basic opportunistic premise in their heads and thinking. You're told and taught that "loss bad" and "profit good". But the real world is different. In real life you job or need, is to change that potential loss to a profit. I know lots of morons on this site don't like lots of words, but the premise must be explained first otherwise you end with nothing but an opinion and listening to dickheads on some dinky website. I've been trading longer than some people on this site have been alive. So yes a 3 point stop is doable and I have used them. Most people want a "system" or some variation of this. But the downfall to this is you cannot manage what's truly unknown. And so now you all have all this stuff about profit factors and some skewed idea of drawdown that doesn't even make sense in real life. If you are running a full auto process unmanned then sure use a set stop loss value. But I have tested many approaches over the years and all of them end with less than 100 accuracy. The only type that really gets right up there well past the 90% mark are the ones that are usually manual and where they identify where their weaknesses (the areas of greatest drawdown when isolating this to view what happened) so you can trade that weak spot of your preset strategy, therefore, unlike most inexperienced traders and speculators, the goal is NOT to try and get 100% SR but let it be weaker so you can create added opportunities that are automatically then built into the strategy. Most people try to use the idea of ...... out of 100 trades I get X% correct and then upon tweaking it they increase this but the good trades from the bad ones are "randomly dispersed" and people never really know when the good ones will occur. Or they try to manually trade but its own history is in question because profits come AFTER the fact so the future must be accessed. Most don't do the last step so it's effectively a gamble. A strategy must be flexible. Most of what I see online is not flexible. It is dogmatically indoctrinating. There's no room for real imagination. So when you look at all the outcome data and charted field results etc, if it IS really a strategy, it should have definable repetition regardless of types of profitability etc. And so you should see where and when it fails to hold on to the market's movements. Do you enter early on time or later? What assumptions are you constantly making re: the approach? Are you being honest about the approach strike points? Position ALWAYS matters. I'm not talking about inverting a strategy here. Track the instrument you trade and superimpose your approach's movements over top. ALL movements including the ones you missed or did not do. The areas where your approach fails to hold will be clear, be it user error or not. If you use a small stop position are you using a 1min chart view or smaller? The key to real trading off drawdown is to understand how the markets move long. Not a chart but before this. You cannot prepare if you're always chasing. A simple example of how to do this is the "always in" approach. People have some really silly ideas about trading and their opinion of this one is a classic. For this you create 2 strategies that impose their idea on a market with slightly different goals - one is to anticipate the start and one does the end. True Delta trading as well as true trend trading use this method so that you take full advantage of everything. Drawdown of one creates a differential FOR the other. This is why trend traders fail to see the end and why Delta traders are too reliant on data. Differential? They approach each other and the zero point is the offset for the difference AND what is similar between them. Still with me? So when you only use one style you are going to get forced to make mistakes. There's no real world adaptability in one style alone. I use my drawdowns to learn and further engage. It really is just common sense. The pic below is old but it is enough to show the premise ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) And now AUDUSD yesterday March 3 2023. Internal range coupled with inner range coupled with transfer range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Most people have got a lot very wrong. Inside every movement are smaller moves. This you may know but money has a life. It's not just the "big boys" sitting there with all the money and doing things. Drawdown IS opportunity. The AUDUSD view is just one account but you can see from all activity present, that counter moves and forward moves is the name of the game. I hope that helps. Peter

Hey Peter, thanks for this long reply. I can agree with you now. You probably already know, how I trade. I'm below 1m timeframe, to be able to keep my SL or DD very small. But always using with higher timeframe. I sometimes break the silence, so everyone watching me should know what I do and how. But this is the reply I wanted to see, so thanks again. Have a nice weekend Peter!

Thanks for your update, looks good. How are your results today?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Lekkim somehow deleted most of the profits. Lekkim, what happened with US30? :/ You were doing so good..

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I'm devastated over my account progress. All went well until Thursday evening. My account topped at 7.800$, then came the unexpected FED comment, made all markets bullish. I was short US30 before that and decided to close my fx positions and speculate only in short US30, big mistake as it's been in a rally up until weekend. Started also trading outside the system and broke some of my own rules, I'm not very proud of it. Have been offline trying to regain morale. I guess the only thing now is to eat my brutal loss and rebuild it up again. Account at 2.300$, so still small profit from deposited 1.450$, but otherwise very disappointing. I can't decide what to do at Monday open, either cut my losses and withdraw it for bills or continue trading this account. Hopefully I will learn from this in regards to money management and trading discipline. But such losses hurts every time. I'll probably end of letting US30 positions run and hope for bearish change, instead of being responsible and withdraw for bills, we'll see what happens. Otherwise nice to see all the activity in thread, I'm behind on answering it all, my apologies for that. I'll do that once I regain my strength. I'm waiting for pre market data of US30 tomorrow, hope I will not get even more screwed if US30 opens gap up. Otherwise I hope you had better last trading days and a good weekend gents. Thanks for the support. To be updated.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
That's lesson. You should never had open trades when news happens. But that's ok. I'm sure you'll get back on track. If you had some kind of SL, it could have been much better. Let it run, retracement might or should happen. Maybe 200 points more up (if you can hold it) otherwise close it and start all over on the same account. I'm sure you can get back. You did really nice.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
This IS NOT cumulative delta you don't even mention what it really is or how to actually get real delta data. HINT: You cant on the forex market. If you think you can get reliable volumes from any broker/dealer your embarrassing yourself. Just another shitty forex indicator strategy, cumulative delta is fine with futures if you pay for the actual data, but no way would i trade off it alone. Simply not important enough or most importantly not accurate enough. Whole point of cumulative delta is to see if majority of trades taken today were on the bid or ask side. That does not exist on forex. Using that knowledge maybe you trade accordingly but still that isn't a holy grail at all or even profitable as the largest participants disguise their true intentions and use both market and limit orders to confuse you.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Yeah, I should have cut my losses after bullish news but I hesitated. I guess I got a little greedy, kicking myself over not taking profits and too high leverage. Thanks I'll try to rescue this account. Problem is that I can only take 1% price increase in DOW30 and I can't afford to lose it all. What a way to make yourself anxious throughout the weekend. Recommended: Maybe you knew this website, but it is as far as I know the only place to see market pre open Sunday trading before market opens. My eyes tomorrow will obviously be glued to that, wishing for a fall. https://www.ig.com/en/indices/market...nd-wall-street

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yeah shitty forex strategy, with profit of 6000 dollars in 3 or 4 days? Correct me exact days count, if I'm wrong. Discussion about that was already few pages back. Recommend reading it. Also I would like to see what you achieved. Saw nothing on your profile so far.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Funny that, my dads a crippling gambler with more to show for it this week then that... the fact you think that means something speaks volumes. ​I've achieved reading actual volumes and knowing what I'm talking about. I'm not childish enough to share my irrelevant $ amount profits to try impress people lmao.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
But you seem very childish enough, to talk here about someone's else system. Calm down man. Picking top &amp; bottom can be done kinda easily even without any paid info. I'm not trading for two weeks, so don't even try. I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but this is Lekkim thread so just calm down. No one asked about your dad. If you'd be of any use, create a new thread and describe your own system in some way and help others. Instead of stupid talk. Sorry. Everyone on this forum has its own system. If you don't like it, simply don't comment it.

Time for some tough advice if u want to make it longer term. I am afraid u have been gambling on your account. the number one reason for people failing at trading is money management. Do u realize the size of the position u have open??? U have have 7 open dow positions which equals $ 230 000 position on a account of only $ 2300 a 1% move against your positions and your account is gone. Do u see the insanity and how crazy this is??? Forex and index trading use huge leverage.The first and number one rule of a professional trader is too protect their capital at all costs. U must protect your capital like your life depended on it. U need to protect your capital so when a drawdown happens u can survive to trade again another day. U must realize trading is a marathon and not a sprint - trading is not about getting rich quick. it is not about making a million dollars in a year on a 10k account - it is about slowly building your account over time. A professional trader only has small daily movements of maximum 5% account equity swings going up or down - not 50% going up or down. On your account size u should of had only 1 dow position open not 7 - having 7 dow positions open is just gambling - might as well go to the casino with your money U need to realize that just because the broker gives u lots of leverage u don't need to use it all. If u are using all the maximum leverage then u are gambling. The brokers give lots of leverage available to lure in the amateurs who think they can get rich quick but they just fail and blow up their account I have been trading for 17 years fulltime and i pay my bills with my trading profits. i keep seeing people blowing up their accounts by having too many open positions. people do not want to learn money management and so they fail. I only withdraw from my accounts and never deposit. Amateurs keep depositing money into their accounts and give it to the professional traders in the markets. markets are a zero-sum game where the money goes from the losers to the winners

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks for your explanation. You had an awesome ride up with lots of trades. Are you making automated trades mostly to get as many of them?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Lekkim, You have been at it for many years. You will figure this one out as well. Performing in public is a hell of a pressure. Cut your self some slack. A bit of tinkering here and there with respect to risk management should have at the end line. Thanks

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Given this statement, I'm curious what kind of leverage you're working with. If you don't mind sharing at least.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Good Luck Lekkim... Your a fighter I love that ! Trading your way out of those US30 trades,,, Im rooting for you all the way ! Cheers Blue

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Good luck! Even though you got scorched you know how to generate money. Nerves of steel and keep up the grind!

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Get lost already. I was already talking with Lekkim about his losing trades. He'll get back. But you showed us nothing so far. Instead of BS. Hmm?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I was observing the functionality of delta indicator and i have question and suggestion. This questions has already raised before but not answered that when we do zoom in and zoom out, line positions are totally changed. Line position should not change because this is not moving average. What is the reason of it? I have one suggestion that you have to add some filter before entering trades. Every asset has its own volatility so we need to add some distance indicator which can calculate that normally how much that pair move away from EMA 200 in particular timeframe before it bounce back. Even ryuryu also use distance indicator (with different logic) for his trades along with volume. This will help to reduce drawdown.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
the EMA 200 as a distance indicator has worked perfectly for me, because I know the price level from which to go long/short. I recommend using it. for example, from now on I'm only shorting. on this pair.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hey Tibor, what is the logic behind this please? Can you elaborate it a bit more? Thanks. SF

--- 帖子 #294 ---
That's still more than double the initial, super! May i ask what strategies are you playing when you're doing automated trades. Or did you just automate that cumulative delta strategy?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
the key is the distance of the EMA 200 from the price. this provides a good entry point to the market. just look at the MA 200 in any pair, if the price is at the right distance, it is a good entry point for trading. even if the price goes against me, it will still return below/toward the entry point. It depends on what position I opened long/short. determining a good entry point requires further analysis. this is also trading with delta, only in a slightly different way. the TP is usually touching the 200 EMA as it progresses over time. the market strives for equilibrium. This is my strategy simplified.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
You mean that if we are far far from EMA, you will want to trade towards it, right? That's nice idea, I was thinking about the same years ago. But I then forget about it and never tried to play with it. Might have something in my mind, so maybe I'll come up with something. Something like this? It's very easy from hindsight, honestly... Hmm I need to think about it. Also please, you can even PM me, what is the " right distance "? How much? How you actually measure it. I might help you more aftewards.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
try to think of 200 MA as a moving equilibrium status indicator.+/0/-. if price is below/above 200 MA then always look for reversal signs. you can use any technique that suits you. I only use H1 this method.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Well you had cca 80 pips drawdown but as you said, price went back to your break even. Good job. However we need some filter, because such DD is unacceptable. I'll work on it.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I feel like I'm letting the thread down with my late replies, It's just I'm leverage my ass off in my real account so my focus been on that, I will catch up on thread posts and read them in detail. I saved my account once again, so I'm satified. Account update: 5.250$ then I withdrawed (1.450$) what I deposited for so I can blew with at worse breaking even. Equity is at 3.800$ and I expect and is higher leveraged in bullish overall sentiment, that's a combo of interest rates falling after FED speak, then also some CM and strong numbers past two days, should make this fairy bearish market around. So I'm long AUD/JPY, NZD/CHF and short USD/CAD and also long GOLD AND DOW30 &amp; NASDAQ (leveraged 200:1). Wish me luck gents! Hoping for new atm end week of 7.800$

You said that you are long on Gold but your price line (red line) is above volume line ( green line ). According to this chart , you should be shorting.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
In chart it's 5 min cul on a short time period, those data was not taking into considaration using alone, I try to match trade signals on most of all timeframes. What I'm doing now is called speculating in pan buy off. That's why I got bullish positions in fx, stocks and gold. My trades are not solely based on CM

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Ending the day with total account profit 4.900$, still bullish but took some profits, yields are rising a bit, so I opted out a bit, waiting for lower interest rates. Now look all but gold in buy in m5 cm. I'm turning this into Lekkim's live trading also, but too exiting not to share.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I've actually taken quite a keen interest in your thread over the last few weeks, and as with everything else, have to go down every single rabbit hole, but I found something I think quite interesting, here's the indicator, very simple in terms of calculation. However, I don't want to post a chart that illustrates what I'm looking at, because I'm wondering if it's as obvious to someone else as it is to me, if you see what I mean, other than to say, look out for REVERSE. If you've no idea what I'm on about, I'll explain more, I'm just curious to see if what you see, is what I see, if you see... I'm looking at 5 and 15 for the most obvious, but higher timeframes for more reliable but more subtle. . Attached File(s) STTSVolume.mq4 2 KB | 432 downloads

I'm still having fun with this. Lowering the drawdown is priority n.1 for me. I was thinking like using 20m timeframe with 30t chart. See on picture, we had resistance, but price still went up. On high TF, we would get big SL. (For small accs.. or we would need small position) if you want fast money, opening smaller lots is unacceptable. What do you guys think? Also, I can't find proper Cumulative Delta on cTrader. So I'm really sorry for sharing this here, Lekkim. Hope You don't kill me. But I believe I will make something useful for others so we can all benefit from it. You trade like hell Lekkim, your profits are really nice . I might fix the drawdown for you or I can give you better entry points. That should help keep the DD lower so you don't delete profits as before. However this is like sniper game. You need to wait and wait... and wait... and then you are finally on level where you can actually do anything. It's annoying but sadly we don't have any change of speed button in forex, lol. Here's the pic, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh, green arrows are potential sell points. We just take the low or high before and go sell or buy there. If you lose, well only 5 pips at max. If done correctly. If you can't wait enough time, you will need bigger SL. That is big no. And here is potential signal from today. Live one, for you guys to see. I didn't took a trade since it's WIP, but I think You'll see that with proper idea, you guys can get break even in no time.. Also, you can boom the leverage asf.

What is the name of indicator at the bottom of chart? I came across the concept of three in a row (bottom or top) and it is showing on your chart.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
A friendly advice for you, Lekkim. No matter how good your strategy is, if you use as much leverage as you are using you are guaranteed to fail sooner or later. I'm seeing a clear pattern in your trading. You go for a reversal when there has been a strong directional movement and you just keep adding to that position until it reverses. Even if you are 90%+ of the time right, there's always this one time when the price will simply not make a retracement before your implied stop gets hit (margin call) and THEN it will reverse. Markets are all about gunning stops. If you use 100x leverage, you have less than -1% real price movement stop (margin call) level. Just don't use high leverage, but returns will be smaller too, i know. But remember, 90%+ of hedge funds barely make consistenly over +5% a year. If you are smarter than them then you'd be a billionaire hedge fund manager by now.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I would like to tell you, but I have no idea at all. 😆 It was renamed by me few months or years ago after I converted it and played with it. It has been a long time...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Lekkim only needs better entries &amp; stoploss. If used, he'll be ok. He was doing great. I'll try same thing as he did in few months. I need time and free time to actually start. It's not that difficult. If you go for 2-3 pips SL and you will have good entries, you'll be just fine. This is needed if you want build big account from literally nothing. Just my two cents..

--- 帖子 #320 ---
if all 28 pairs scanning is done and use weekly resistance support along with his indicator can do better with drawdown.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Should be. Actually lowering stoplossu to 3-5 pips is needed if you want build acc from nothing to hero.

Would someone be kind enough to once and for all give the mathematical calculation behind that indicator? We are looking at a lot of pictures and they aint helping a lot if we dont know how is being calculated.

Hey all my dear trader friends... I fucked up. Ever since I blew it on friday I spent the last couple of days in bed, depressed, kicking myself over my loss and why I did not withdrew some of my profits. Some might say that, oh it's not that bad, it was just 7000$, but for me, it was more than that. My whole reputation was at stake and I disappointed every one in this thread including myself. I went from 1.450$ to 7.000$ and still I was not satisfied, I got greedy and impatience. Because of my poor money management, I have a lot of past due bills. Why, why did I not came to my senses and withdrew the profit. This was my chance. I became 'high' of the attention here on FF, and I wanted to show you insane profit, however it turned into the opposite. It's hard for me to put this into words. I'm so ashamed and feel like a clown. I'm licking my wounds and try to regain strenght to carry up this thread again. Sorry to let you down. I maybe will take a break from FF, until I regain my morale. Thanks for all who cheered and believed in me. My apologies and green pips for all, Lekkim &lt;3

look at this system so I can't use it because I can't find a solution for the unpredictable DD. I have to work on it too. have you tried filtering entry points with momentum indicator ?

Hey Lekkim, I also blown the account. So I'm with you. Let's fix it together next time! I stopped using SL, yes I am really stupid. I know. Only 300 euros, but well, still bad. SF

--- 帖子 #336 ---
i think you listened too much to mister caleb;-) When you trade without SL, you need a very special money management. this is very confusing at first.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The indicator is freely available from the MLQ5 marketplace. The indicator's author is detailed there. If you want to know how it works, ask him. Good luck with that though. He has a number of "paid for" indicators that use his core freebie indicator(s) (including the one that is the basis of this thread) for volume-related information. It's his IP so why should he tell you? If the indicator works for you, think of it as a black box, say "thanks" and just use it. If it doesn't work for you, then don't use it.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
yes, one of the most difficult questions is where to put the SL.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Sadly it was my idiotic mistake. Here, picture. The sell you see on the exact low, should have been a BUY trade... This wouldn't kill the account at first, but the line of other bad trades started to killing my trading plan in my brain. Well, shit happened.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Any idea Tibor?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
the entry points must be filtered somehow. have you tried using the momentum indicator for this purpose?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Entries are filtered by itself. By price. You buying on low. So originally first you see price... Ok, I'll say it otherwise. You see price coming down First low is made Price come back to low You buy SL is under the low Voila it's done. Easy trade with 2 or 3 pips SL. You can go up to 50 pips this way, IF you catched low on H1 or bigger TF. Got me? I'm trying to filter this somehow to get it work better, but it looks like it's not possible. I have some idea, but programming skills are just... I might do it in the future.

Why you leaving Lekkim, send me dm. lets get on ZOOM and i will show you what to practice. Are you on telegram ? https://assets.faireconomy.media/nfs...1451345_25.gif Vivad if you want to join us on zoom send me dm

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hi Lekkim Hope you can spend time away from the markets and reflect on all the good aspects trading brings to your life, while burying the bad omens that too often put us in a bad spot. If you decide to research the markets further, I feel the best approach is always to find a strategy that allows you to trade against market participants. I am not talking about being a reversal trader, I am just suggesting trading Long if the retail market traders are short. I have the luxury of watching level 2 data coming through my Future Trading Platforms and the most shocking detail always is that aggressive bankers always attack the side that contains the most liquidity. That means if Long limit orders are stacking up on order book, they go short and mostly always win. This tells us most traders don’t trade trends but trade against trends - so look for strategies that trade against retail traders and small players and your’e be happier than a dog locked in a sausage factory during a long weekend.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hey buddy I’m not leaving, I just might take some time off to prepare for next month where I have decided (due to all your warm support) to live real trade again with fresh 1.450$. (I know that 1.450$ to some is nothing, but that’s what my budget can hold) I sent you DM and looking forward to our zoom meeting with fellow traders. it is how it is, I wishes my finances could afford a bigger bankroll. Actually I’ve been so passionated about this forum and thread and wanted to show my skills off. Let me be honest, I did not pay my rent this month so It’s a bit off a headache. But I guess it shows you my commitment to profit eventually together with you all. So I invest money I can’t afford, but hey, no one said it would be easy to make a living in the markets. However it has always been and still is my dream to really make it in the financial markets (probably your dream aswell) We’re in this together somehow. So rest assured I will try again to prove myself and build bankroll beyond 7k$ profit. I will never give up, but it really did hurt my morale when I blew my big profits, only thing left to do is learn from it, right. You must understand that risking it all and live trading in front of you, all my peers, is both frightening and a rush. Looking forward to the 31th of March where, hopefully, magic gains will happen again with all the years of hard work to prepare a winning strategy and money management. I will not think about the small amount so I get greedy, I will consistenly build up the bankeroll with proper disciplin and avoid too much drawdown. My story here on FF is not over, like terminator said: ‘I’ll be back’

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Rick, yeah that’s what I have been doing last couple of days, I’ve accepted it and is back with renewed energy. You know trading is always a ‘love / hate’ relationship but I would not be without it. Call it addiction, call it passion, but for me the trading dream we all wish for is something that’s keeps me going. My hope and my dream. Non traders call us many things, but they will never understand like us. Fact is that if you find an consistent edge in the markets, it doesn’t matter how low you are on cash, with time you can become wealthy because of endless liquidity. So shout out to all fellow traders who refuse to give up on their dream and spent endless time researching, analysising, back and forward testing, demo and real trading. Nobody ever told you it would be easy to ‘beat’ the market. Imagine if you could make ‘just’ 2% gain each trading day, that would turn 100$ into 14.100$ in one year. This reminds me how stupid I was with my extreme high leverage, I could just have gone for like a hundred bucks a day, that itself you could live for. Compounding interest still remain so undervalued, but somehow still so hard to stick by and be disiplined enough. Let me also state that trading, if done right is not like reguarly gambling. In a casino you bet against a mathemathical algoritm where you statisticly always will lose in the long run. In forex and other financial market’s are not bound to a payout % or other code, it’s free flying, open to analyse and predict. Our days financial markets are the closest thing you will come to ‘a free market’ and remains a playground of money for it’s participants. It’s still is beautiful, as it stands as a chance of true capitalism that still rewards the intelligent trader who finds an edge. Also let me be clear, if you consistently and with luck taking out of the picture, can make a lot of money in forex you are better than most hedge funds and banks who can’t even (even with their knowledge and tools) make a profit each year. Thet being said it’s also a very tall task, only for the brave like us. That’s just my five cents, gents. Back to your post Rick, I agree with you that retail crowd mostly lose, just nearby impossible to get live data on that, the closest I’ve come is this cumulative Delta strategy. But it sounds interesting if you have valid futures data on that, please feel free to share some info or charts here in thread on it, thanks in advance. Enjoy the night all. Best regards your Lekkim

Also don’t underestimate the challenge of controlling your mind and emotions during trades. I have many years experience and yet I can’t always hold my own rules. This is not talked about enough but handling yourself is as hard as it is to find a winning formula, so you have two very hard tasks. A friend of mine once told me, after hearing I wanted to conquer the FX market, if I just wanted to find what’s nearby impossible and prove others wrong. Made me think, actually some truth in it. Like we men have a desire to adventure and the unknown. Even though (let’s get serious) only a fraction of us on FF will go to the Moon and drive lambos while enjoying a beer on our private Island. Heck, just making a living been taking me over 15 years. Thank God we have Forex factory, it’s by far the most serious trading community there is. At least people are honest and have good will here. I’m so sick and tired of false claims, scammers and people selling their courses or want you to follow their holy grail for a fee. Trading in general is getting a bad reputation from false claims and false information. It’s also due to the fact that trading basics it self is rather complicated, it takes many years to learn and master. We all know that the best traders wouldn’t have to sell anything. They make us traders look bad. As so much else there’s no easy shortcut to profitability. Forex is no way a get rich easy scheme, but you should know this. But I’m speaking in this post to traders on all levels. As all other dreams both financially and otherwise it takes hard work. I’ve never met a profitable daytrader with less than a decade experience, just to formulate that this dream if you want to succeed take blood, sweat and tears and many of us deal with being to short sighted in our approach. Patience and valuable information, then you might stand a chance for the stars. Respect the law of randomness. Be smart enough to know if luck, noise or randomness played a role in your trade. Admit when you lose control of your money management (like I did with the 7$k account), look at numbers, facts and stats, don’t get lured into delusion (knowing all the time where chart would go etc) the mind can easily be tricked into believing it can predict charts and remembers when you where right rather than all the times you were wrong. An illusion state of mind costed me a couple of years of wrong trading. So sometimes you have to accept defeat and kill your darlings. That also why it’s healthy to get feedback so you don’twork hard on the wrong path. Be humble but also take the risk needed to change your financial situation, if your poor then if you just stalling and do nothing, it won’t change, however try to be somehow responsible and trade what you can afford (trade at your own risk this is not trading advice bla bla). Here in this Forum are actually traders wanting to help, share and contribute. Most of us have big ego’s and tend to overvalue our system and ideas. Years back I was strubborn and thought I would lose my amazing system by sharing it, big mistake. You know this but let me say it again even if 20.000 FF traders traded the same system, it would not have any impact at all in Regards to moving a trillion dollar market, so let it go and share your best. That’s why I just shared it, for my self also. The feedback I’ve got made me wiser. If your solo you will go in your own echochamber, always nice with fresh pair of eyes on your trading thoughts. We tend to brainstorm and form ideas better while together, we’re social beings afterall, not robots (even though we try to have disciplin like a robot, hehe) So thanks all in this great community for making me a better trader over the years of reading, discussion and sharing. Constructive critisism is undervalued also, it can save you a lot of time. And then ofc praise and likes feels good always. Hope you can relate to my posts here. I’m really talkative this evening, wanted to share some thoughts with you all, hope they make sense. If just a few viewers watch my info and advises here this night and benefits, it’s worth it. Sharing is caring and some of the stuff I talked about I wishes I had known or being told earlier, together we make the best traders gentlemen. Best wishes with your positions everyone

I trade against the trend because the price will return. there is currently an imbalance.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I am so sorry to hear that Lekkim, although I wasn't surprised to hear that. As I said earlier, your strategy is flawed. No matter how huge percentage gains you make, counter trend traders will blow up their accounts eventually. I even saw some people in FF made over %1000 quick gains soon before blowing up. However, what made me surprised is you haven't understood this even after 15 years of trading (at least you insisted). You speak like a trader with 5 years of trading experience. Look at the chart below. Why don't you just trade following trend (my definition of trend is following MAs by the way): Attached Image (click to enlarge) You SL is previous swing high/low. Isn't this clear, neat and straight forward? (By the way, if you want to use Cumulative Delta, try Crude Oil or Nat Gas instead of forex or stock indices. Energy futures are mostly traded on exchanges and volume data is relatively accurate.) Also, FF is a waste of time and won't help improve your skill. Lastly, day trading is a no better than a circus these days. Why don't you just buy Apple and Microsoft stocks when they are cheap? Hope it helps....

Joe Dinapoli said about divergence: "Don't use an Oscillator to price divergence as an entry technique, unless you have an excellent means of filtering it. Even for the best of Oscillators this can, and often does, spell disaster, particularly for the new participant. Price and Oscillator divergences abound, and the market continues to stop out the divergence players. Looking back in time, you're sure to find divergences that work, but when you're going forward in time, as in real trading, the accuracy of this technique just isn't there." Trust me. Divergence is a joke and only amatuers believe this.

oscillators.

Feel free to share memes they always make me laugh, there are not many trading memes but I will share some, a laugh in between our serious trading talk is refreshing, don’t be shy share all your trading humor. Lemme’ start: *Me when account margin level goes below 100% and my metatrader terminal turns red* vs. *Me when I hit it right in the ass and is up 500%* Haha do you recognize fella’s? Also if you start praying you are taking too high risk.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I fixed divergence years ago. I don't use divergence on oscillators. Only one, but that's also the filter. However agree on fact that it does not work if you use it as majority of traders. But these things needs updates, it will not work magically for another 300 years.

Heispark, sharing this for you specially. One can use it as main signal to enter a trade. The entry is at the price where the lowest stoploss is. One simply cannot blow the account. It's impossible. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Aaaaand signal done... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #359 ---
this is very promising.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Of course. Funny is it does work 90% of the time. Maybe even more. Never actually counted. However if used correctly can be really nice. And also, sometimes price doesn't get into the zone, but reaction is there. This can be fixed by changing settings, or simply wait for signal. Sometimes it will give 4 signals daily, sometimes only 2. Normal intelligent trader would say that it is enough and maybe it really is. SF

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi mate ! I am pleased to read you, since we share many core values !!! And I am joyfully and patiently waiting for your return. Hope you forgive the below inquiry. Your sharing is worth a lot to me ! When you have the time, I was wondering what happened with your account about which I replied 3 weeks ago here: And also, how did you lower your leverage and how did it work out for you? No rush, and only if you wish. Thank you in advance Lekkim! I find your realizations shared above extremely important. Keep on sharing and building on that progress. It will pay greatly in the end (not too far away ).

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Thats is really promising. What indicator is this one? And is this TV platform?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I like this, 90% effective , maybe more !! and a moment ago you wrote that you burned your account. I'm waiting for the time for people on all these forums to understand that only money in a bank account is an effect that can be counted on. Not attacking you, but if someone has amazing strategies for 90% or more, they don't write posts on the forum, they create their real life. the vast majority just seem to be able to do something. They constantly write comments touching on new strategies. And at the end of the month there is a minus in the account. ONLY THE FACTS MATTER! Show me your balance account, if you really have strategy with 90% effective, so you are very rich, but or stupid , if you are not.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
in the meantime I added another long and the SL.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
This has nothing to do with system. Problem is psychical. 😂 I lost account because I stopped using stoplossy which should have been 3-5 pips. I went all in. Also, I knew price on USD/JPY should move down, sadly I was believing and hoping that it will reverse. Yes it is TradingView. Only way to get my indicator to PC.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
not to make money with 90% efficiency, the problem is really deep,but that's your business, I know that such efficiency does not exist. or they are in large organizations. You will find out later.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Ahaa, sorry then. I didn't knew that you KNOW that efficiency of 90% does not exist. If I just knew before.... I was doing this, but 90% efficiency doesn't exist. Exactly. Count with it! This was really acc after I created this system of trading.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
woooow , amazing, I beg you, be my father I've seen hundreds of such screenshots, then these people disappeared or changed threads where they could post comments. the fact is you're left with nothing. and only facts matter, facts are tangible money. Besides, to determine the effectiveness, several hundred plays are needed. paste this screenshot and let beginners ask you about your amazing strategy. I know you're up for something like this

--- 帖子 #369 ---
be open to learning, just in case you discover something new. you can learn something from every strategy. just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Sure man. I invite people outside of ForexFactory to telegram and I sell them the system for 10k US dollars. (For admins - of course it's irony) I gave thousands of hours into my work, posting it for free on FF and you're trying to b*tch me up here? Because you don't know something, doesn't mean it can't work. This is exactly the thinking that will move you to nowhere. Continue like that, you'll definitely move somewhere. You are exactly the reason why I don't post any working things here with full info. Have a great evening.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I agree that learning process never stops. I don't have trading system but yes i trade nicely just by reading PA but you never know that there are much better ways to trade. I am here on FF for a long time and initially lost money in trading but then i found how to trade profitably. I have never criticize anyone. I never consider myself good trader. I always look for new ways to trade because i know that there are many better traders than me. I wasn't feeling well so stayed away from trading since Tuesday. Hopefully i will join back on Monday. Have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
and you are the 90% guy who kept my forum visits to a minimum. I'm doing my thing and I don't need to be appreciated. spend another thousand hours, and maybe you'll finally learn something. I like you mr ninety, you are funny boy. keep posting your amazing strategies in different threads. I'm going to make money.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Sure dear. You don't even understand my system properly, how can you compare something if you don't even understand it? What exactly doesn't work here? It does not repaint, I'm sure you can see it in the chart. Yes, these were made from history, but in reality it's the same. You just need a LOT of patience. How to draw those zone is clearly visible , since I threw out the random way of drawing the zones. It is much clearer now, compared to 5 years back. Indicator is actually used multiple ways, it's not really only this. However this can be used as main signal to entry, then you just filter it. Damn why do I even try, if you make enough money... Why are you watching threads of others on FF? You know how to make money, just go and make them. Easy as that. I'm only wasting my time and energy with this. P.S - This is used mainly for entries. I never said it should be complete system. My idea 10 years ago was to get rid of drawdown for people will small accounts. And bigger accounts might use this, for opening big amount of lots, to withstand and reduce DD with possible SL 3-5pips. I think that's more then enough. You can use any other system and this to look for entry points.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
are you trading this system now.?or are you still developing it.? I'm still updating my system because I know how to fix the imbalance, but I don't really know where to put the SL. It won't work long term without SL, so I still need to develop this SL question.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Well I trade it and also developing. Both is ok. I understand you, SL is worst thing. But once this is fixed it's kinda easy.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Nice results 👍 impressing... May I kindly ask, if you used your trading idea from your last thread (another simple trading idea) for this results? Once again: good job 👍

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Is this indicator is "Pricebands.algo" in your first thread? There is something different in it and i wanted to give it try. You draw support/resistance lines with bands?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Sure man, it all comes from the same idea. You can use anything there. Sure, anything is usable. Any indicator from me or others who made it. Maybe you'll come up with something too.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Greetings everyone. The thread blowing up with activity and private messages took me by surprise (but so nice). I have not been good enough in responding to posts for a long time. My bad guys. I’m going through some serious issues in my personal life so even though FF is my passion I need to focus on my health and well being. I decide to risk it all for a better life, but I also got bills right: Just so you know what I sacrifrice for funding, you know like never trade what you can’t afford haha I can’t keep that rule boys. Calculated risks and taking chances deserves respect in my opinion. Don’t underestimate dedication also, remember they say what you love you become good at, right. Take my info and do your own due dilligence always, maybe you can improve it with your own finesse. Just don’t expect me to make a thread and you become millionaire in days okay I’m not that clever and if I had the Holy grail I would not share obviously, but I still believe this strategy got a very fair chance of success, otherwise I would not have shared right. I’m not here to waste yours or my time. I except I will be on and off online here as it’s been for weeks. Not optimal but again I’m not and can’t be sitting always online for other needs. Also let me make some comments on the thread so far. If I knew all the hate I would get I probably will not make anymore threads. I did it out of hype and kindness to share my best. I did not promise anyone this was a Holy grail okay. Hope the attacks on me will stop because I’m just a humble guy who dedicated my life to my financial markets dream. If you don’t like the system fair enough, try share if you have anything better okay. I spend many years here and mostly fellow traders are so nice. But I’m done being so nice if insulted incorrectly. I will not say names but some traders wanted me to fail from start, however i remains nice. If I see such thing again I will tell them what I really think about their unjust critisism. I’m a nice guy but reading all the fight in thread is annoying now. However polite criticism always appreciated. Just talk like gentlemen okay. But hey it’s free speech so it is how it is. Also remember a strategy just have to be like 60/40% to be amazing, if any knows better be a good sport and share it. My ego is not that big I just hope this thread will somehow make some money in the end. I’m not an investment banker for JPmorgan allright, but what I have done is looking for profitable edge for over 10 years. I believe my sharings are somewhat valuable. My Father who passed away some years ago did currency arbitrage and stock broking in the 1980 where spreads and commissions were huge. Easy to make bank back then. Market changed and you can’t make a living making orders for other anymore. Heck even getting a job in trading is no where to be found. Only thing coming close is investment departement in banks or hedge funds but you need at least 5 years experience and more education for that. To be honest our profession is dying because all became so transparent and cheap for all to trade themselves. Even banks and hedge funds can’t even make a profit each years it’s a joke. So what now? Well you need to build your own account or prove me wrong and show me there’s actually any real trading jobs left. We must adapt and do it ourself now. So it was hard to find out that my dream job did not exist. So we are all left with the hard challenge of making our own living in the markets. Maybe if you can show a great record you might land a normal finance job, but doubtful. No one cares about your skills until you show them your profits. Rule of capitalism I guess. Also non traders have no idea how hard we worked with no pay just for the knowledge and experience most of us got here. It’s actually amazing how much many traders know about not just trading, but finance, economics, politics etc. but sadly it’s does not equal profit that’s a fact. Market is so irrational and makes no common sense, if it did we could all easily predict. Thinking back, wow all the factors we know and spent years learning. What is a market, what moves, price, indicator, fundementals, software, how to make a trade etc. If normies knew they would respect us more. It’s always a fun reality check when you talk with normies. Like how little they know right, haha. They be like oh I once heard about stocks what it that? I tell them stock market is what you first learn, then when mastered you become more advanced like forex haha… stocks is for boys forex is for men lol. oh boy I’m thinking about all the traders, who have skills and does not profit. It’s hard not to cringe trying to explain people what we do. Trading can be ruthless to even the best of men. Many give up along the way, but the best or most brave or insane haha will never let this fucking challenge rest. Conquer it someday we might okay, like everyone I’m overall in loss ofc let’s be honest. It’s part of learning and becoming better. Noooo one goes trading for the first times and makes amazing gains then it’s pure luck. If some noob gets lucky he will sell a course or sell his lousy signal. Forex got bad reputation from newbies and scammers. Just look at youtube it’s all garbage info; happy we have this Forum instead of influencers trying to sell a signal or some useless shit you sometimes see. As experienced trader you learn to call bullshit very fast, because you almost tried it all. Trading will test a man on all levels. Ego, emotions, disciplin etc. One of the most stressful jobs in the world also, some can’t even trade other People’s money and we are here risking our rent haha, takes some balls. No guts no glory. We take loss and pain and try to come back wiser, every fucking time. Sometimes I think why, why forex became me life right? I could have choosed easy normal life and job. It is who I am now. I can’t stop looking at my charts, and why should I, it’s one of the things I’m actually good at. It’s my destiny. Holy shit imagine if we had got paid to learn all this. Idk what 15 years is in hours, but I once heard that if you want to master a craft you need to invest 10.000 hours, so I guess it’s soon time to get rich for me haha. So my respect for fellow traders grinding all these thousands of hours alone before a screen, alone, who never gives up. Back to my dad Then he moved to real estate and bought up in the 1990 and made a living from there, he did allright and was great to me always, bless his soul, thank you dear dad, rest in peace. When I was young i looked tv text for stock quotes and a long life passion began. Went to business College and later got a degree in financial management. Just letting you know how I got addicted to markets. I carry on my fathers interest now and what he taught me and I will never give up on the dream of financial freedom.it’s hard to accept our society and how much fucking money means, I hate it. But i figured from a young age to get the same freedom my Father provided when I saw the struggles of poverty. The system is ugly but you can scream and cry or adapt and accept. Money equals freedom and options and life will challenge you if you got none. Trust me I’ve been there feeling it. There was no bailout for me from my mom or anything, it’s okay it taught me. Also let me just note that I never reallt experienced poverty compared to some persons in other countries. But everything is relative you know. Many lie but I can tell you this, i did not inherit his millions of dollars okay. I’m actually on a sick leave from work right now. I’m just human afterall. I rent and don’t own, I try to make ends meet these days. Also give me some credit I deposited all my fucking income to trade for you, ignoring all by bills. Hope you at least will say this dude got some balls. When low on cash high risk is needed, that’s why the higher bankroll the easier it gets, like we all know the first million is the hardest. Goodluck all who keeps dreaming and working hard for our goals again. You have to believe because no one else besides peers here give a fuck okay. As I said earlier I’m low on cash until end of month so if not anyone want to fund my ass I try to stay patience. I at least expect now that nobody accuses me of being a scammer or in bad will. I did not promise anyone miracles I’m just human even I know we all dream of the fast winning formula. I have some time on my hands now so if any needs help with managing accounts with investor password I can help for free at least in beginning or zoom or whats app. Keep asking here and I will respond just don’t except fast replies okay I need to relax also, there’s more to life than FF ofc u know that. At last I want to remind you I shared all this with the purest of heart, so please don’t judge me if I do not meet your expectations. I really value all the great support I’ve recieved here, it’s been overwhelming actually. Also made me smile that you still back me up even I failed my live account. Makes me think you see something valuable in me as a trader. Each post and like have felt like a rush to me, so whatever happens I still enjoyed this journey with you all, no matter the final outcome. Getting so many likes on my posts have giving me so much confidence, I enjoyed so many days high on my peers kind words. Just thinking all those smart traders using their valuable time reading my ideas and thought, that did and will keep me going here, nothing makes me smile more than recognition from trader friends. I think we all can let our ego aside and wish each other the best. what we really need here on FF is for just fucking someone hard working trader making big profits, I would love to see that. I myself will try month after month but if other succeed would still makes me smile. We all been through margin call after margin call learning, optimizing, forex is like the hardest game in the world so if anyone can beat it consistenly or anyone have done share it, so few success stories but they are to come my friends. Let’s fucking prove all the non traders wrong someday, it’s not impossible! For fuck sake all the ignorance we must lay ear to. Oh quit your hobby, get a real job? What is forex? You are delusional, better save and get fucked by inflation, uuuh risk is bad uuuh are you a gambler? It’s a scam bla bla. Pisses me of, at least you understand. Looking forward to proving them wrong. Hope you somehow enjoyed me stories and thoughts, I post whatever comes to mind here because I know no one will understand better and benefits than you fellow gentlemen. If you want I would like to hear about your journey, maybe we been through the same, consider sharing friends. Thanks again and best wishes on your journey towards profitability, to be updated / Best Lekkim

Hi SilentFather, what is the name of that Tradingview indicator which creates the red line / green line above/below the price bar chart? I tried to find something like that in Tradingview but was unable to locate....

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Yes you got some balls Lekkim 😁 Two thoughts... Take your trading out of the spotlight and keep it personal.. nothing wrong with sharing some details but the online world is a savage place.... The mental game that comes with that is a whole nother beast. Secondly but most importantly IMO... First and foremost as traders we are Risk Managers. Hers the kicker that refers back to my first point... Is you are a risk manager of your financial capital...and you are a risk manager of your mental/psychological capital... They go hand in hand 👍 All the best Lekkim ! Blue

--- 帖子 #382 ---
It is private right now. Settings also private, that's why it's not public. People don't understand it properly, so I stopped trying that much as before. :/

--- 帖子 #383 ---
hi LEKKIM. how are you progressing with the development.? I hope this thread doesn't die.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I've been offline from FF since April 1. I missed this forum and the wonderful traders here. I will be replying to messages soon. I'm back! Stay tuned, I will update this thread in the next couple of days, ttyl.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Thanks for the support throughout my threads. Overall feedback on strategy is positive so I'm yet back again trying to improve this in my endless search for the Holy Grail of trading and path towards constant profitability. Did you really think I would give up? Never, haha. Been testing a lot and will be sharing update on system soon. Get ready for Cumulative Delta Price Volume 2.0!

Final strategy is result of this thread and also developments from previous treads, took many years of testing. Enough talk for now, let me share how to trade it and then you can try it out yourself. I will be updating how to trade with edit on first post alongside latest posts here. Also new template will be uploaded. No more talk, now action. Will be proving it myself real live account again soon. Looking forward to your feedback. Here we go:

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Cumulative Delta Price Volume 2.0 What changed? Not just red trades, now both red and green trades. Not using 'active' mode on green volume only 'all' mode. Not using MA1 at all. Using indicator values instead of pips/pair value approach (different overlay). So using just one red price line and one green volume line. So what are we looking for? We are looking to 'catch the extremes' when looking for trade entry. We are looking for the most extreme scenarios of difference in the two lines, calculating they should follow each other in general. The bigger number and ratio difference the more extreme therefore better and more profitable. Attached are screenshots of examples of extremes we are looking for to trade. So to make it simple you see two lines (red price and green volume) and the difference between them should be as extreme as possible and then it's like a tug of war between them. See attached examples:

--- 帖子 #389 ---
What do you need to get going: My guide, indicator download, template download, the more brokers the better for confirmation and noise cancelling (I use on 3 different brokers since volume data differs from each mt5 broker), compare difference time scales or whatever you see fit. I look for same signals on more timeframes to increase chance of profitable trade. It's actually pretty simple once you understand the basics. DYOR and good luck gentlemen.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Random red and green trade with data from start Sep (H1) (PS: latest indicator update fixed some rescaling issues (re calculating which looked like repainting) Now data is the same on the period of data regardless what time frame, so M1 data shown is same as H4 etc.)

_ __________ hi , is this still Only for MT5 ?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi profits7, last time I checked the same indicator did not work smoothly on mt4. I will check later and make template for mt4 also if possible. Otherwise consider downloading a mt5 demo.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Decided to delete old frontpage information on how to trade since new method is better. Guide in first post in thread and examples in latest posts in thread. Enjoy testing. Spend all night sharing this, hope it can help someone and that I will not fail you guys.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
It can also be used to intra and day trade. Like look at GBP/USD this morning on m1 chart. Some big green scalping opportunities (arrows where optimal trades could have been taken)

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Welcome Back!! It sounds prettty much promissing. Thank you for sharing your hard work.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I appreciate your kind words, it keeps me going. I’m sharing my best, hope the hard work pays off, been grinding this theory/approach for many years now (since 2019) also earlier thoughts on this can be read in previous threads if anyone is interested. I’m making a demo now and will risk my income live next month, putting my money where my mouth is as usual, hehe.

Natural Gas Trend is bearish. Currently oversold. May find some short-term buy oppotunity....? Attached Image (click to enlarge) (1H chart) Attached Image (click to enlarge) (1M chart)

--- 帖子 #402 ---
The standard template setting is set to current month. It can be customized in the indicator setting by the way. Also your nat gas chart is not a sure signal, since there's pulling each way, but yeah if you should take a trade based on current month data only with strategy, it looks like a buy signal.

Mild buy on my main broker also on nat gas on current month H1. Not extreme enough though that I would take it. Try confirming with other data periods / time frames maybe. Also note that nat gas pair is less traded and can make more noise when analyzing.

Let's try a little live no money trade... Scalping on the day NZD/JPY looks bearish

Full of hope today, lol. Please if you try this strategy out share your inputs, maybe you see something I miss, the more we are the higher chance of finding that edge. Thread got 77k views someone must sit on some good constructive feedback, thanks in advance.

I use IC Markets demo MT5 with default settings of the template. Indicator data displays only on M1. In other TFs, it's empty. Is this only me? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) (EURUSD)

Strange, it should show on all timeframes right away.. Try restart terminal and go mt5 settings and put unlimited bars.

Hi Lekkim, I've got the same problem even if i put it on unlimited (i even dont see it on M1) But seems interesting Thanks

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thank you for your feedback but it doesn't work to me. Perhaps there's some broker dependencies involved..... What's your broker by the way?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi rosalieone, hmm not good... I tried myself to download the template and copy it to my own terminal and it works fine. Out of ideas what the issue comes from, will think about it. heispark I don't think it's a broker problem, it works fine on my 3 brokers. My main broker is FPmarkets and others OcttaFx and ForexCom. We have to get this fixed, I might try make new template.

I think my terminal is still downloading history data. When I put this indicator on a new chart without using your template it looks like the following (1H): Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think I just have to wait some time for full downloaing. I guess there's some option to manually pull the data but I am not very familiar with MT5... Anyway, time can fix this issue. EDIT: I can be wrong....

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Maybe your broker realized you're gonna make a lot of money with strategy and template and shuts you down, haha jk. It should be easy, download indicator, load template, done. That is how the indicator looks without my editing. Can anyone say that it works correctly after download? Mt5 normally so much faster and better than mt4, I never had similar problem.

Spent 17 hours on FF today sharing 2.0 strategy alongside testing, hope it will pay off eventually. Planning on trading live demo tomorrow since today shared trades been profitable. Guys this could be the edge, finally. I've never tested anything better and I'm looking forward to some comments on it from fellow traders. I will soon call it a day so if there is anything else I can do for you today let me know, best regards Lekkim.

I think flat line (green or red) with double top is best way to trade with proper money management.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Just started a demo 1 hour ago to intraday scalp, already up 22% with over 30 different trades. Gonna share soon, what a way to end an extremely productive trading day!

Up 28% in less than 1,5 hour scalping along all pairs, wow. And this is 'just' intraday data not even confirming other data periods.

Yes my experience with Octafx is nice. I also have another broker BDSWISS which is also good.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I have bad experience with OcctaFx about spread hunting, I just use their demo for data. Info: data from broker demo is the same as if real account. So you can just download demo mt5 and use for data comparing. Such a nice day for me, I've been awake for 24 hours now, but good testing results keeps me going.

Some of the most clear obvious trade signals today if daytraded:

--- 帖子 #428 ---
3,5 hours of scalping resulted in some of the best live day trading I've ever done using just main broker and shared strategy and template, I'm fairly proud of this one and will continue growing the account tomorrow. In numbers: 51% profit, 6% drawdown, 78 trades with just 22 losing and with avg losing position smaller than avg winning (across many pairs and currencies), 10,08 profit factor all data on account is available and verified on myfxbook link here: https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/20/10440783

--- 帖子 #430 ---
4 years, that's how long I've been searching for the edge / grail with the price volume approach. I guess it's both true dedication and crazy. Hope to God that I've finally figured it out, because I will not stop until wealth and freedom will be achieved by trading the financial markets (primarily forex is my main interest but I've traded everything throughout the years. Here is link to my previous threads regarding the same matter: "Tug of war in market flows" https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...n-market-flows ? "Advanced volume trading" https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...volume-trading ? "Using volume to predict price movement" https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...rice-movements ? Also attached polls... If hard work should pay out I'm (you too) are in for a great time if I'm right with the high profitability of this overall trading strategy. Time will tell I guess, I'm having a hard time in life recently and this is what's going to save me, hopefully. If not I will be ruined but I will never give up, ttyl gentlemen.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
28% in few hours is a lot. You are over risking or just got very very lucky. Which one is it?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Yeah it is, also since it was a pretty low volatility day and hours, so 213 pips was well played also considering it cost 23k just in commissions (excluding spread). Over risking it, yes I was using all 500x leverage (would not do that if real account) but also traded a wide range of currencies, "very very lucky", I hope it was not just luck, maybe both. Need more live trading days to prove myself and system so factors such as luck, randomness, market behavior etc. can be ruled out. I would say if I decide to day trade at least one week or a month of overall constant profits, then we are talking, right. I will be back at it again tomorrow and then we will see if I got something or not my friend.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I have one request that for sample , take screenshot of at least one trade per day where you have open position. It will guide many new traders.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Please can you check this difference? There are two charts one is M5 and other is M15. Behavior of red and green line is totally different. One is straight and other one is in angle.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi Lekkim Congratulations on that excellent trading session, don’t waste this opportunity to benefit from the days success. Start up a “Winning trade journal” that boasts on your success. It needs to include screenshots of results, setups and goals you hope to achieve into the future. Right now go outside and scream “ I’m the best bloody trader in forex factory” and start believing it. There has never been a successful trader who doesn’t believe they are one of the best traders in the world. “Your’e got this” ”Shit I’m really good and I can achieve this success every day”. 80% of your emotions need to embrace your recent success, almost 0% needs to embrace your losing days. Gone are the days you try to learn from losing days, that’s history. Now tell yourself I am only going to study winning trades and I’m going to bloody shout and scream on every winner. Yes Yes Yes Don’t let other traders tell you that 28% increase in equity is a lucky day. You want to win 100% increase in equity one day. Your a winner, now go out their prove it TIGER PS. As a fellow volume trader - I’m backing you to be something special

Quick profit scalping just now, CAD/CHF green trade long. NZD/CHF long red still running long. GBP/CHF still running long green. Attached my settings in indiator for use in daytrading and or looking at data from my 3 different brokers for confirmation. 4 trades open just now all in profit so far.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Actually behavior is the same, look closely. Use also mouse also drag and see value will be similar, however small different from m5 and m15 calculation. This trade was a small red signal yes, but not extreme enough that I would take it, green did not dominate enough upwards and red barely dragged down. What pair is this and what is your data setting, I will check on my brokers if you want my feedback? PS: need to update frontpage guide, need to explain better and I miss sharing some other rules that improve strategy and trade entries. Maybe I get time for this today otherwise remind me. I have all rules and system in my head but It's complicated to explain. Also use all 28 pairs (all 8) and check them all the time when scalping. Advice: install this spread indicator and give it some seconds to get best price before entry.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Will do buddy. I will guide you the best I can. Already I shared it all so other traders can trade just like me if interested. And keep asking if questions arrive.

Divergences between price and volume is always to be watched and analyzed. Once you get used to it you will automatically review each trading pair within seconds. I started writing a more detailed in depth guide to trade this method, frontpage will be updated once it's done. I will not rest until It's as good as it can get. I'm an educated financial advisor and worked in finance but out of work at the moment, so this thread is my main focus and that's why I have time to look at charts all day long. Gonna say it once and don't use time on it again since It's obvious, but everything I text is not financial advise and do your own research. Breaking the code in fx market is the hardest challenge or game ever. Most likely I will fail but there is a chance for the holy grail always, haven't become rich in trading in 15+ years of trading, traded everything, stocks, fx, crypto, metals, commodities etc. If anyone need advise to setup trading account or how to move money I can advise you free of cost. Skills is developed by knowledge and mistakes and mastering market takes years. If newbies read here I tried to make it simple, if it works no need to know how it works. I have no hidden motives other to help other traders and myself. Never pushing or selling, hope that at least can give some respect no matter the outcome.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Volume trying to push up NZD/USD, but expect them to surrender and today bottom to fall out setting new lows falling until volume sets new low Same situation on gbp/chf long, will set new high and rise until volume gives up setting new high, see attached. Red long on audnzd where green dominating upwards, price to surrender and rise up to green line.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Just as predicted nzdusd dumping, took profit too early should have stick to closing profit at new volume low lol. Also gbpchf new high, now just waiting for right call on audnzd, there is no bs here. Feels good and all calls are traded and documented on myfxbook link.

Hi Lekkim, I've tried several times to unpack the indicator, but it fails to unpack. Will only the tpl you posted on the first page work? Do you have the unpacked MT5 version you could share? What do you advise?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi acetrader! Have you tried downloading indicator through frontpage link, manual search on mql codebase or in terminal market section? Template only works if indicator is already installed on your mt5 terminal.

Take easy bro, you've got too much 'hopium' and became high I guess.... By the way, what's your new plan to prevent ruining your account again by adding losers? In my perspective, it can be a decent tool to gauge overbought/sold conditions like RSI but always price action/market structure study should come together. More importantly, you have a fixed stop loss!

yes, some kind of financial management method would be needed.

Why don't you watch some youtube videos about basics of MT5. I myself am not very familiar with MT5 either.

Hi Go5, Thank you so much for sharing that with me. I will give it a go &amp; let you know how it goes. Best of trades to you, my friend.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Is your MT5 installed under C:\Users\your login name\AppData\Roaming\MetaQuotes\Terminal path and did you locate the accurate location while you installed the indicator from MQL site? OP made some update on his new MT5 template to minimize the relative distance effect between the two lines. So, you may want to use his new template with MT5 indicator instead of the old MT4 counterpart. Lastly, use FPMarket's demo account. Among the others, it seems this one shows the best result (tested ICMarkets and Octa ). OP himself usde this account as his main account and he used and cmpared multiple accounts from different brokers for best result. This is all I can do for you at the moment.

Last online Oct 28. Reasons for absence: Lack of motivation, lack of funds and financial woes, illness and new job. Looking forward reading posts and private messages, my apologies for leaving without announcing. Been doing some testing still and working on a 3.0 version. Had some impressive results earlier on live testing but failing last demo after I took it up 500% in days destroyed my morale. Regained confidence and will be back trying to make some money once again. None of my posts are financial advice, trade at your own risk and do your own research. To be updated, cheers gentlemen.

I will write a more detailed guide on how to trade, will dedicate this month to proving profitability. If I fail in that, I will consider 'killing my darling'. I do not want to waste my own or your time. Theory needs to prove solid results now, I've spend years on this. So either I'm completely delusional or this method is great. I want it so much but we all know beating the market is very difficult. End goal is to make money, for all of us. That's why we are here. I don't care how or who, but our search will hopefully get us return someday. If anyone have something better than this please let me know. Sharing is caring even though we all have big egos. It must be possible somehow to be consistently profitable. It does not really matter how low bankroll you start with (ofc easier to make money with bigger account) but if you could make 1% on average daily on trading days, it would compound into 1.200% gain in just one year. I simply don't have the funds to my own money in, but demo works exactly like real, so first step is to prove myself over several weeks in every market environment, I tend to talk a lot of get high on hopium, but results and stats speaks louder than words. So yeah, dedicating this month to get closer to my dream. It truly hurts me when I can't live up to expectations and I just wish myself and you freedom and wealth. At least I'm really trying. Felt so bad after failing last experiment that I failed you, almost got depressed. Came back because this is my true passion. Green pips for all let's try make it to the moon together!

Hey man I have always been interested to your work also if I never uderstand the right way to trade with your indi. Maybe when the chart is made it is more easy but during the trade I can't. Please take a look at this indi. I made some experiment and look good. https://forex-station.com/volume-ind...60390-510.html Let me Know your opinion

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Welcome back. I think you need some accuracy. Why don't you learn some price action. Adding losers will ruin your account eventually. The following user's thread is a good starting point. He posts live tradings with decent accuracy. https://www.forexfactory.com/stevepatt CDV-Price divergence indicates some interesting moment can be ahead. Then find good 'ineffiency' points for entry. Try it. Lastly, I'd try S&amp;P500 or Nasdaq futures instead of forex. Futures have accurate volume with accurate CDV. Your new MT4 template looks also flawed. It doesn't display the CDV correctly anymore in my MT4. Good luck to you.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Also, it won't harm trying other indicators on top of your system such as RSI, MACD, ... for better entry. Keep open minded and improve your strategy.

My idea is that: there is an indicator called Pearson corrrelation indicator in mql4.In old TSD ,Mladen coded Pearson corrrelation indicator to indicator version using two inputs.For example corrrelation of RSI to price.So it is quantifiable to detect RSI divergence without lag with Pearson corrrelation indicator extreme levels. You can follow same idea with Pearson corrrelation indicator using volume and price as inputs to detect the extreme levels of Pearson corrrelation indicator as volume price divergence.Let us know if it is profitable.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Or just simply take the difference of price and volume and trade the extreme levels as divergence oportunity.Let us know if it is profitable.

Plan for last day of trading this week. Intraday live trading, getting back answering posts and pm's. Armed with trading fuel and hopepium I once again will justify spending all my time on trading. Have to achieve success in day trading tomorrow and next week. I need to prove myself when thoughts of delusion creeps in. Must admit I'm addicted to trading (don't know if this is good or bad, it's just as it is) Planning on going from rags to riches still, the ride never ends brothers. Also not good enough I've been so unstable in answering in thread. No promises, also the stick been giving to you know, take it and go to the moon or through it in the trash, always trust your gut. Cya and endless green pips for all in the world's hardest game. Remember compound interest and take calculated risks. Newbies be aware, it's a lifelong journey, never seen a profitable trader with less than 10 years experience. I made all the mistakes, it's costly. Shout out to my stock broker Father when he look down, no matter the result it will be worth it, no guts no glory. What we try to do here on forum is admirable. The essence of true capitalism. If you want to be really good at something, you have to put in 10.000 hours, also being disciplined in trading and life a challenge for all, I will never accept wage slave job. Let what other call an illusion become reality and never give up like a real man. P.S: if anyone have proof of consistent short term profits I would love to see it, extremely rare to beat the market long term. If you think this thread is of no use and you have the method, please share it here.

Decided to re write first post guide, will be updated once ready. Also uploaded new 3.0 version of template for users going back to using two volume lines and added 0 line, making it slight improvement of system. Will start new demo in a few hours trying to scalp again. New viewers wait with trading this system until new guide is up on frontpage. Uploaded 3.0 template both here and on frontpage.

Thread reached 100k views, that's crazy. Hope I helped or did inspire fellow traders along the way, that was my intention. Thank all contributors and supporters for help and motivation, been keeping me going all those years. It hurts I have not been able to make us rich yet. Tried my best and hope that at least can give some respect. Disappointed in myself that results have not been better. Not ready to throw in the towel just yet, as mentioned earlier I dedicate this month to prove strategy and system. I still believe but I also noticed some flaws to be cleared out. Hope not to let you down again with false hope. After month end I see results without bias and decide to continue or not. I'm man enough to admit defeat if that is where this thread ends, until then I will work hard. Times been though for me, I could use success with trading. Remember I do not try to push or sell anything, all my activity here in this forum been sincere. Still roaming this forum to get rich just as you, hope I'm not blinded into illusion by my dream. At least I think this system is at least as good as avg on this forum, so I can still look myself in the mirror with my contributions.

Hello, Ive been reading some of your posts and wondering if you know, there are indicators that give you real Cumulative Delta Price Volume, from the central futures hub. The indicators are free but you need to pay for the data source, very cheap though. BTW: I’m not selling anything, I just can’t be bothered to post and get abuse from the morons of FF. Regards Asw

You dont seem to be paying close attention to some of the advice from keen followers of your journey. You are going it alone. No one makes it alone. Incorporate other ideas like Market Structure. Smart money Concepts. ICT concepts, and so on and so forth. Also good money and risk management. With a 1:3RR per trade for example, you need less than a 50% win rate to be profitable. That is the holy grail in my opinion. Trading has a lot of moving parts. You only figured out ONE of those parts. Pay attention to ideas figured out by other traders as well. I'm pretty sure some smart traders here have picked one or two parts of your idea and incorporated it into their own existing methodology and smiling home with it. While you are here giving up? Isn't that ironic? Bottom line...Don't give up. Pay close attention to ideas from other traders and use them to improve what you have already.

Day trading went well Friday, will continue next week, still a glimpse of hope. My life is a mess at the moment, lost girlfriend, in debt, about to get evicted, searching for new job and had break in at my place where I lost my PC, all putting a lot of psychological pressure on me. Wish someone else with more time and discipline can make some money out of this and accept my priority sometimes is elsewhere these days, ttyl.

The indicator is not bad and can be better if you make it to auto calculate and display distance between red and green. This way an empirical value can objectively be used as when to start seeking for entries. *Any particular reason why you prefer it on mt5 not mt4?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Yeah right, glad it's not just me who think it got potential, like a lot? I tried 1000 indicators and even with it's flaws it's great. Needed someone to tell me this, thank you skyf. I'm considering taking contact with indicator founder, to improve it. I already shared with him my thread and thanked him (Evgeny Shevtsov). Remember I created settings, theory and strategy but not indicator itself. Credit to him also, cheers m8. Edit: mt5 works better than mt4 all over and same indicator did not load or work in mt4 when I tried, but maybe that is fixed by now.

ICT is fraud. Guy doesn't know what he is saying. There is other guy who can trade so called S/R in much better way. He exposed ICT few times already.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I have no opinion, one way or another, about ICT's personality or character. The knowledge he shares on the other hand is open to individual verification. In trading, it's always the trader that makes any given knowledge useful or useless. Some of ICT's stuff I find useful. Others not so much. So I pick what works for me and ignore the rest. Every trader should try to create a hybrid trading methodology that uniquely suits their personality and temperament. Here a little, there a little. And not just copying someone else's homework and hope it works as advertised.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Correct. As you said. One more thing I wanted to say but I forgot. Things that works in ICT does work, but not in the way how ICT said. Hope you got me. :X

I've been using CVD on my small live account for some time. I use it differently from you guys but maybe it will inspire some insight. I use TradingView's Cumulative Delta Volume (chart) indicator to confirm trend line breaks. I use a 1:1.5 RR and found some nutty results.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
If I blow another account I will quit. I'm tired of trying my best and if I can't make money with this I should not continue this thread for the sake of my fellow traders. If I'm not profitable today and going forward I will either let this thread die or have it deleted, still hopium but depression luring. Lekkim is tired man, haist. Thanks T721 for nice zoom meeting, we should do this more often.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I wait for a strong/long run of CVD in one direction, in this case bearish. You can see (large red box) that at no time during this run (hours) did bullish volume REALLY overtake bearish volume. Once CVD crosses, and bulls are in command, we wait to make sure CVD doesn't immediately cross back over, and continues to push up and stay green. Then, we check the most logical and relevant trendline. You can wait for a break and retest, or break and continuation. These two entry criteria create a pretty strong entry method.

There is a new update with the indicator, there are some new features that I am checking out right now, the maker of this indicator is genius. Check photo for new cumulative delta settings.

A have a new motto: "Trade as your life depended on it" (because for me it does) absolutely no time to waste, I would rather fx test than apply for job at the moment.

Lekkim, I was never able to be successful at getting any of the Cumulative Delta indicators to load on my chart, but I continue to follow your thread as it goes along. Just remember this........"You Are Never Defeated Until YOU Quit." Don't quit my friend. Continue your journey, but first as you told Ryuryu on post # 18, GO RELAX YOURSELF before resuming your efforts with Cumulative Delta. Thomas Edison once said, " I have not failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that want work." Best of Trades To You, MY Friend.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
CDV-Price divergence is a well-known concept and I think it's better than Oscillators-Price divergence. It can be used as an useful reference but for entry accuracy, you need price action and market structure knowledge. For example, this is Natural Gas futures charts. Divergence is good and interesting, and I entered at 'inefficiency' point with good RR as described by Steve. Look at his thread. He posts live charts and they are very accurate. Learn from his charts then apply your technic on top of it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Lastly, do not use divergence alone as an entry technic. Joe Dinapoli said about divergence: "Don't use an Oscillator to price divergence as an entry technique, unless you have an excellent means of filtering it. Even for the best of Oscillators this can, and often does, spell disaster, particularly for the new participant. Price and Oscillator divergences abound, and the market continues to stop out the divergence players. Looking back in time, you're sure to find divergences that work, but when you're going forward in time, as in real trading, the accuracy of this technique just isn't there."

--- 帖子 #587 ---
You're close. That's all I can say right now, because I'm able to work only with phone. Can't do a sh$t. My PC is dead. I'm fu$@&amp;# too. So much problems in my life right now. I will be honest. I wanted to start arguing with you, after reading this post, but I saw the second one about CDV divergence and yeah... Nothing I can say no more. You're right. Lekkim will get there eventually. I see what you mean. And I agree, fur sure. I have one more theory we can use with this, but sadly, I can't do anything right now. I was talking before something about 50% (retracement?) I never fully disclosed it. Need some work. I tried before, but it was harder than I thought. Can you see what I mean if you look at chart? Just clean chart... Let me know.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi SilentFather, I will tell you like I told Lekkim in my last post to him. Don't give up on anything. "You Only Fail If You Quit" I always enjoy reading your ideas you have shared on the FF. Some I never can get my mind around, but that just me. Stay focused &amp; life will correct itself just as the market does when it gets out of BALANCE. Looking forward to you sharing your next idea. Best of trades to you going into the holidays &amp; beyond.

I coded python code to analyze flow volume by MT5 platform connected to Globex Market to have REAL VOLUME and not FAKE VOLUME CFD

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Yeah, you're correct. My ideas do work, as I traded them before. I then lost my mind. After that my trading was disgusting, I can say. Now, without any computer whatsoever I can do nothing sadly. I can say that one needs a break before working again with something otherwise you'll see nothing new on chart. I still know there are places on chart where price will reverse without a drawdown and they can be found even on naked chart alone. Maybe we all saw those somewhere in our trading journey. Same applies to Lekkim. He has some nice ideas that need some more work. They can be very profitable. Also, it doesn't really change anything if we use "fake" volume or "real" volume. It doesn't matter. Volume can be also seen on naked chart. We don't need to pay for anything. It's just there. I had zero information when I was trading my ideas alone, and I made 3400 USD from just about 500 dollars. I had some information about banks, where they had their orders, but main idea used was everything I shared. And I traded mostly EUR/USD. It was fun actually. We need to somehow filter our entries to get smallest DD possible with leverage as big as it can get. Then you'll start building your acc from almost zero. And we need to keep it like that.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi SilentFather, I agree. It's all there for the taking once we find it. The sixth line on your post reminds me of an article I read some time ago about Trading the White Space on the chart. Didn't copy the article &amp; when I tried to locate it again was unable to do so. Really can't recall any of the details other than the article said something to the affect that the empty white space always gets filled. Maybe something like FVG.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
That is correct most of the time. However counting just on such basic fact would give you drawdown as hell. Better idea would be summon a demon and ask him when price will spike somewhere and then trade accordingly. (This is not a joke. I'm literally starting thinking about that.. for fun)

My fellow forex trader friends. I have to make a hard decision now. All those years, up's and down's. I really tried my best to make this strategy work, but I failed to prove profitability. Therefore be very careful trading using methods described in this and my earlier threads. I'm sorry I failed you. Throwing in the towel for now, but once I regain strength I will continue pursuing the financial trading dream. Wishes my brothers on FF will make it one day. Giving up was never an option for me, but I do not wish to promote something here not profitable. All our times are too valuable for that, just know I did all with the best intentions. Farewell for now, I will take a break on FF and only return if I come closer to the Holy Grail. Been depressed lately and my apologies for not answering threads and private messages. I struggle with my mood and unemployment, can't even afford Christmas gifts. Thanks everyone for the loyal support here throughout the years and best of luck in your future endeavors. Best regards, yours Lekkim &lt;3

--- 帖子 #599 ---
hello That doesn't sound good. maybe you're putting yourself under pressure. and then there's being unemployed. a little piece of advice from me - try the demo and don't take it so seriously, you don't have to prove anything to anyone.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
failed no at least you want to learn and try new methods , i have never been a fan of long term trading thats why i scalp to many dangers in long term , macd_OSMA is my scalping tool on 1 min , i do have others , maybe a time to reflect and change whats gone wrong NEVER GIVE UP you have the go to get it right . god bless

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I am so sorry to hear that. Obviously you need some break. Find a job and continue exploring the trading as a hobby like me. Trading as a hobby is better than playing computer games. Don't push yourself too hard. Next year will be different. By the way, your strategy still has some potential I think. We need some more experiments and tests. Merry Christmas and happy new year.

Hi Lekkim Sorry to hear your’e strategies journey has come to a end, better to break away totally from trading for a period to recapture your passion for trading till next year. Giving up trading isn’t an option for you if really love this game. The first thing you need to fix is your mindset, then your’e be hungry to work on your new profitable strategy for next year. AFTER ALL - IF 5% OF TRADERS ARE PROFITABLE, I’M GOING TO BE ONE OF THEM TOO. I’m going to PM you a link to a book you NEED to read over the Xmass break. Then hopefully if your read it enough times, you will be able to see a way forward with clarity. It’s a CHOICE to be a profitable trader, you just haven’t decided to take that step yet, but you can.

"It’s a CHOICE to be a profitable trader" Interesting statement of your. How can be a choice? I don't think people choose to be looser. Isn't it?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi Merka Yes, many choose to be a looser because they are UNWILLING to do something that makes them uncomfortable. Ask yourself what you are UNWILLING to do in your pathway to profitability. These are a basic list of failures by losers not only in trading but sometimes also in life. 1.. They fail to identify a process that can lead to profitability. In other words, they have only tried a small handful of strategies and presume because those strategies failed, every other trading must as well. Basically they are impatient in finding a success process. 2.. They haven’t changed their mindset into a trader who that has unconscious believe that they are a winner. Have you ever caught yourself saying, “I have no luck when I trade”. That’s a looser mindset right there before they start trading. You need to be unconsciously competent in believe you are a dam hot trader (ugly people can be dam hot too when they have a great self respect). 3.. Lazy and not prepared to backtest a strategy for months without a live account in sight. They say they have no emotional content with the market on Demo accounts - really they are lazy &amp; impatient. 4.. Refuse to allocate time in their life for their pursuit. They don’t time block periods of the day where they are free to concentrate on their endeavour. That means no phone calls, no interruptions from family members or work during this period.. It total blockage from the rest of the world so you can concentrate only on trading. Then you may learn how lack of concentration (turn the bloody YouTube off) by most traders may actually be their real problem. 5.. Having no time period goal to success. In other words, if it takes 2 years or 5 years , so be it. Are you prepared to do all of these things. If you are You choose to be a profitable trader

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Understood what you mean. Thanks BTW, even with all the above actions and more still no guarantee of success otherwise only 1% of traders will be looser instead of the opposite

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hi Rick, can you please also PM me a link to the book you recommended to Lekkim as a mindset MUST read over the Xmas break. Having the right mindset is very important for success. I'm looking forward to the mindset boost. Thanks.
