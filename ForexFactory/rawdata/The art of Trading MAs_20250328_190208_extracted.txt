I have always loved MAs for their simplicity, I started using them when I first started trading with a good deal of succes but then migrated to other approaches over time because I had a hard time filtering out the bad crosses - that would be those crosses where you are only going to make a few pips or loose a few. If people want an approach that is easy to use and not a lot of smoke and mirrors here it is, if you don't like it don't trade it, if you have snide comments I don't want to hear them, if you want to contribute please do so. I would also expect that everyone be respectful of one another at least on this thread. The focus of this thread is to teach a pretty simple method of trading MA's. The setups are pretty simple I use a 5 and 13 EMA and the COG indicator. I use the COG indicator to filter out the bad EMA crosses. I am primarily a technical intraday trader and trade hourly charts, but it the trade looks promissing I may hang around for a few days. I actively trade 9 pairs so there are always at least 3-4 good setups a day which can result in a few hundred pips each day. I do not trade around major news events and I tend to pay attention to my trades. I typically do not set stop losses unless I am going to be away for a while, if I do I only set them at 20 - 50 pips depending on the pair I am trading, gbp/jpy gets 50 the rest 20. I don't want to hear all the crap about setting stops etc etc etc, I think stops are a good thing but if you are picking your entries well and paying some attention to your trades you save yourself a lot of money. This approach works on any timeframe from 5 min to daily. To answer the inevitable question of why don't I trade this daily or weekly the hourly charts best fits my personality, you have to remember trading is more about the person than the system in my opinion. My money management system is as follows I only trade what I am willing to loose, I purposely keep my account balance low so that I am not tempted to do stupid things and I have fun with it. Trading is something I truely enjoy, for those of you that are just in this to make a quick buck no system will help you, you have to treat this like a business and it helps if you love what you do. If I loose a few hundred bucks on a trade big deal, you loose a few and win a lot. The Setups are as follows: Buy: Bar closes below the bottom Green line on the COG followed by the 5/13 EMA cross. You can close the trade at the next EMA cross or use just wait for price to move to the opposite side of the COG indicator Sell: Bar closes Above the Top Green line on the COG followed by the 5/13 EMA cross. You can close the trade at the next EMA cross or use just wait for price to move to the opposite side of the COG indicator. I have attached a gbpjpy trade I am currently in as well as the COG indicator.

Very simple and interesting. Thanks for sharing....

--- 帖子 #3 ---
thanks for sharing you trading method. I trade on the daily charts for the time being and I will have a look to see how this will play out. I've seen the COG around but have never used it. Happy pipping to all of is! thanks again dave

--- 帖子 #4 ---
What settings do you use for COG? I have these settings. Got this indicator some where else. Also, can someone explain exactly what this indicator does. need clarification, tks. Mike BARS BACK - 125 M - 2 I - 0 KSTD - 2.0 SNAME - 1102

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for sharing your system with us. I am a scalper and I am going to use this with my system.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Did you take the long on the 22nd?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
the Indy you posted does't look like indy on your picture.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You have to add your own EMAs.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
BARS BACK - 240 M - 4 I - 0 KSTD - 1.0 SNAME - 500

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I occasionally will trade this approach on the 5 min charts if nothing looks promising on the longer tfs. Using the green line does not produce such good results on the on the shorter tfs but if you start looking for the MA crosses once price either falls below the orange line or crosses above the top orange line you will have a good deal of success. DO NOT just trade the the COG, while most of the time you will be successful you can get screwed because of breakouts so USE the EMA crosses to confirm.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I understand that off course) But on you picture i see COG looks like BB. In COG that you post i can set bars_back param, and it draws only that number of bars, whith very different results. please chek the file

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Endroute, thanks for posting your system. Which pairs do you trade (apart from GBP/JPY) on the COG settings you posted? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I should have posted the COG settings I use: bars back = 240 m=4 i=0 ktsd=1 sname=500

--- 帖子 #14 ---
i believe the approach will work with any pair I look for setups on the following pairs, of which you can reliably get 3 good setups each day, today there were 5 that I took and 3 more that I did not. The great thing about this approach is it works in ranging and trending markets. eurjpy, usdjpy, eurusd, gbpusd, audusd, nzdusd,eurgbp, audjpy,nzdjpy

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi endroute, Thanks for the system. Looks very simple and effective. Could you please look at the chart and confirm if I'm right with my comments ? They assume that we wait for EMA cross for exit. Regards MS

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks for sharing your method. I am interested in learning more about the use of COG. I have a few questions about COG and your method. You stated that a candle must close below the green line for a long position and above the green line for a short position. Are you concerned where your ENTRY actually takes place? Are you concerned about the slope of the COG lines? Do you take partial profits along the way (possibly using COG lines for that) and move stop loss as trade progresses? Are the COG parameters you shared for all time frames or just H1? Thanks again Charlie

--- 帖子 #17 ---
The cog repaints. . -- so you need a confirmation signal. Its work okay in ea's. but a big move in the wrong direction will leave you poor.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Sure,I guess thats why The Ma's Cross are secondary,the cog is only a filter(a primary indicator). Thanks for the system endroute.I personaly like its simplistic structure.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You are right on. For the exits I will typically wait for the next ema cross, except when the price has gone from the bottom of the COG to the top, at this point 9 times out of 10 price will fall back towards the blue line of the COG.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
COG is a filer for the EMAs

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Charlie, The settings I use work on all time frames from 5min to daily. Do not read anything into the slope. I do not do any scaling in or out of positions, for me it just complicates the system too much, but with that said there is no reason you can't or shouldn't.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If you are gonna trade the COG alone ONLY trade the orange lines and nothing else for your signals, so if price closes above the orange line you would want to place a sell order and below the bottom orange for a buy, I would recommend using something like the stochastic oscillator or a MACD to help confirm where to place the sell order in this case as sometimes price will continue well above the orange line for a while before moving back down. What you are essentially doing is trading price action at this point, this is just giving you some visual aids. You can actually do pretty well with this approach on the 5min charts, you can catch a few hundred pips on eurjpy or usdjpy using this approach, I do not trade this way on any other pair as there is either to much volatility like with gbpjpy or not enough with aud/usd or usdcad. Please remember these are ways that I trade and that I am not advocating you trade this way but these are approaches that work well for me.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
The rules are very clear Is it possible to write ea for the system? I am not a programmer Izak

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hey bro, There's no way we could accurately based on the COG if it repaints itself! It may be between the green channels when the EMA crosses over but over time it will automatically repaint until it looks that price to be at the bottom or the top at the orange lines. How do you judge on this?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Endroute, thanks for your method. Looks good. Cheers

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I have been scalping on 1 min Eur/JPY and it works quite well. I wait for price to close above or below gold line then I place my order. I did have to add a stoch (5,3,3) to make sure I would get in at the right time.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
yes, you can add to ea fairly easy -- I could write into farhad hill or bruno or something if someone is interested--let me know... there is a lot of "stuff" that needs to be added with Cog to be an effective ea---as far as I am concerned ... the Cog is a very pretty repainter but has its place. ..... "there is no bottom" ... "there is no top" -533 will leave you poor on this one. 20 3 4 stochastic helps a little for orientation. You still have to consider momemtum and other things.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi cjd, Do you use ema cross as well? Zu

--- 帖子 #29 ---
zu si fu mainly i wait for crossover

--- 帖子 #30 ---
4xWeezal, Thanks for the Stoch. inputs. EA for this method would be very much appreciated. Cheers

--- 帖子 #31 ---
All the COG does is help filter out the crappy ema crosses. Yes it repaints, but who cares you use the price crossing the COG thresholds to begin looking for your ema cross.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Il put something together in next few days. writing something different today... Also what is the max number of bars that should be looked back before the ema cross?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
my opinion buy position- open when MA cross t/p upper green line. s/l lowest brown line sell position-popen when MA cross t/p lowest green line.s/l upper brown line TF 1hour your advise pls sir

--- 帖子 #34 ---
4xWeezal, it would be nice to have the number of bars back optional ; let's say up to maximum 6 bars. That way we will be able to test for what is the best input. Thanks for your effort Cheers

--- 帖子 #35 ---
looks like a good system, but i think it will work better with price action and following the trend .... i was just checking it and at aussie thats is raging now will work nice but for EU/CAD that is uptrending now it will work better if you only take the lower cross overs so you can catch the breaks plus you are trading with the trend .... check it it looks good !! i am not very big fun of indys but this one acualy looks good !! GREAT JOB MAN

--- 帖子 #36 ---
GBP IS DOWN TRADING AND IS ABOUT TO MAKE CROSS OVER !!! like i said follow the trend and this system will work great

--- 帖子 #37 ---
check out 1hr and 4hr chart that a winner!!!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
AIN'T THAT A BEAUTY!!! that will be my last chart i taking to muh space in this thread lol

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I would look back a max of 10 bars but set it to be configurable, especially for the slower moving pairs

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I will use a public ea to adjust as some of the others I have were partially written (money management) by folks that probably don't want credit or may not like it.. If anyone wants a pivot filter, momentum, ema 200 filter or other signal. ... let me know and I will add in. Also, I am self trained coder so I do things a little different than programmers. Anyway, if we can make this profitable...it be a small miracle.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
How might I go about downloading the COG.Ex4? I havent done that yet. Thank you so much for your time. Anne

--- 帖子 #42 ---
any way finished ea....will post after testing late monday. out of town on sunday. will have: (longs and vise versa for short) -look back period - up to x bars. --price must be below gold line at selected lowest low ( adjustable lookback bars up to X bars back -- can change to green lines but endroute said not profitable . -ema entry - adjustable ema cross .. price entry must be below blue center line for a long ...vise versa for short. (no fresh cross because we use lookback with price below gold line// current ema bar 0 &gt; just closed ema bar 1) (I am a 5/5 open close guy myself - so I will change if necessary) -Cog settings will be used from end route. - trailing stop. (did not do cog sl ... too much movement I think) - closes - will have 2 but can add // ema and 2 RSI above 80. --- both above the blue line. ALso, minimum profit to filter out false closes. Let me know if there needs any other signals.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hey guys, Just backtested this system with virtual trading from Vhand. Of course COG repaints big time; however, we should not accept this. When I was backtesting this system, the two moving averages were always in the middle of the COG indicator. I figured that I might as well use the two moving averages by themselves since I did not see any valid point that we need a COG.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
yes, I agree. COG is a repainter. It is suspect from validity. Gold lines might have a little better chance - if lookback is less than 5 bars. Not a lot of trades likely. ...but hey. It was kind of fun doing one of these. The cog is vey pretty...The ebay folks would love this indicator.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
hi , I wanna backtest this system , but the COG indicator covers only about 250bars in my chart and I wanna backtest this system for at least 6 months back and if I increase the bars_back variable , the indicator changes . anyone has this problem?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
4xWeezal, thanks for all your effort. Looking forward to testing it. Personally, I like the COG filter. Cheers

--- 帖子 #47 ---
4xWheezal, we may possibly want the option of following filter; when the COG lines are heading up, take only Buy signals. when the COG lines are heading down, take only Sell signals. Thanks

--- 帖子 #48 ---
probably required. Also, appreciate the feeback. I like entry an exit signal assistance. That makes the ea work well. Also,, If anyone asks for martingales and % of equity and "garbage" to mess up your ea functioning ..then I ask you call a professional coder. You want to concentrate on hit rate.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i like it . thank u!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
AnneMarie (post 41), Easy, just go to post number 1, and click on the indicator enroute posted, it will download to your computer. From there you can put it into your MT4. If you don’t know how to get an indicator into your MT4 platform, this is easy to remedy too: just go to youtube.com and type in “ Secrets of MetaTrader Lesson 3: Installing Indicators ”. Life is good and simple Now for a question: endroute-- when you say EMA, is that E xponential M oving A verage? Would you mind posting the 5/13 EMA indicator you are using? Thanks, and great thread Piperomia.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thank you for your time. I really appreciate it!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
All I use are the moving average indicators that come with metatrader, go to indictors trend and selece moving average, when you are setting up the MA Method as exponential

--- 帖子 #53 ---
For the most part I have just been using the next ma cross, using anything else limits your winners. I would not worry about the slope of the COG lines. Just trading the ema crosses after price has at leased crossed down below the bottom green line for longs and above the top green line for shorts is the way to go, just trading these signals last week would have give you over 2200 pips, this is with closing the trades at the next ema cross.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
endroute, thanks again for you nice and simple method. Are you trading only the 1h TF? What are the 9 pairs you are trading? Cheers

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi endroute, thank's for posting this interesting system. Can I ask, what time a day do you trade this system? I guess from London open to London close will be good with high volume. How many pips a month do you make in average trading the 9 pairs? Thank's for any input, PC

--- 帖子 #56 ---
doh! cant believe I didn't pick up on that... thanks. I'm looking forward to the market opening up so i can give this system a try.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I trade most pairs on the 1hr but do trade some pairs on the 4hr. I trade the following on the 1hr usdjpy eurusd eurjpy nzdjpy gbpjpy and these on the 4 hr usdcad audusd nzdusd eurgbp The great thing is this system allows you to track a number of pairs, because it is so easy to look for setups. I trade anytime I see a signal, so an EA would be great to just email you when there is a setup. I have been using an ma ea to email me ema crosses only but I only run it on a few charts as I would be getting a ton of alerts. On the pips per month question I make a very nice living trading and this is my primary system, I do also trade price action on longer tfs but with much less success. You have to remember success in primarily in the trader, for example if you go into a great setup and price goes against you for a bar or 2 you can't chicken out, trade the system. I have to say I have been doing much better using the next ema cross as my exit as opposed to some other subjective approach like stochs, cci etc.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hello endroute, to your knowledge, will it make big difference if my broker's time for a beginning of new day is 3 hrs earlier? Thanks for all your help. Let's hope that 4xWheezal will have the EA for us soon. We should be able to use an EA for this mechanical method. Cheers

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Broker time does not matter with this, your days will just begin and end differently, but should not affect where the bars are.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
endroute, if you are making good coin on this... you may want a professional coder. - Also, if there are other coders go ahead on this.--- you may get it done quicker and better quality. Also, in my ea just written there were certain things not functioning properly (I can 't use some eas' as they are from private forums and the coder would not them released) so I will need to select another one off a public site and do a rewrite - it may be a little less robust but will fit your conditions of how you trade this particular strategy. There is plenty of time.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
4xWeezal, Thanks for your effort. It is very much appreciated that you are going to share the EA with us. Cheers

--- 帖子 #62 ---
vI assume everyone has the settings for the cog so youll need to make your setting adjustments. I took a public ea written by Coders guru and adjusted. I have not tested yet but that something people can do... coders guru is a fairly decent money managment programmer and ema cross kind person so that will be of high quality. I was planning to use another ea I wrote but it has some proprietary type things that are different and took a long time to develop so you will need to understand if I am not all that interested in releasing. If the system is good, this ea will do what is required. I will make some changes or another coder can look at if they feel like. Some explanations: extern double TakeProfit=150; (self explan) extern double TrailingStop=30; (self explan) extern double StopLoss=30; (self explan) extern int HedgeLevel=6; (not quite sure?) extern double trading_hour_begin = 0; (self explan) extern double trading_hour_end = 20; (self explan) extern double Expiration = 7200; (not quite sure... think its for a hedge) extern int ShortEma = 5; (the slow ema part of cross) extern int LongEma = 14; (the fast ema part of cross) extern int lookbackbars= 5; (on the current time frame --how many bars should the ea look back at the highest high or lowest low where price has closed above the "gold line" .. the ema cross is the second part of the trigger. let me know if you want to use the greens. I can change it easily or add an option. extern int CurrentBar = 1; (use the current or the close (1 to 2) for the ema cross extern double Lots = 0.10; (self explanitory) let me know of any trouble. This will place trades in both directions of the trend. I can add that in and put in next post if you only want to trade with the cog (1 versus x bars back for example) The initial system was both trend and counter trend. I have traded cog ea in the past and a big run in a direction will be trouble as in certain markets you will get a zig zag pattern at about a 40 angle and wipe your account out.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi, Till the EA is ready, here is a good EMA crossover indicator i found, that can alert us instead of being in front of the screen. It also has a great option of filtering MA over crossing false alerts, like in consolidation periods. Hope it helps, Dani M. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=429

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Dan mir thanks for the indi. From what I understand, this indic. is for a cross of EMA and SMA. Endrout's method is using 2 EMAs Cheers

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Dan mir, ignore the previous post; I can see now that we can change the SMA to EMA. Thanks again Cheers

--- 帖子 #66 ---
to endrote : i was added your indicator to my system , but have froblem ? it don't like u ? it is very short in my chart .

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi, No, You can select the type of MA to be used. Use this settings: FastMAPeriod 5 FastMAType 1 SlowMAPeriod 13 SlowMAType 1 Earlypips 1 ResetAlert 10 Dani M.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I think the problem is that you didnt use the number of bar endrote use. The settings of the COG should be : 240 4 0 1.0 500 BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
thank u very much . Good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #70 ---
first of all thank you very much for letting us use your system it is looking very intersting also waiting for the EA for your system just a little question in post #1 you said for long bar close under green line and a cross over of the ema's the question is should the ema's cross be also under the green line of the cog indicator?? and of course for short the opposit BTW HOLLAND IS GOING TO BEAT ITALY 3-1

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Endroute. Thanks for sharing your trading method.Its very simple and easy to follow.I just catch som pips on usd/jpy and nzd/usd. Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Endroute I have been trading this system for a little over a week now and I have been doing pretty good with it. I'm finding that I am more comfortable waiting for the close of a candle and the ema cross to occur below or above the green lines. I am also trading it on the 15 min chart. How long have you been trading this system for? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Trying out on a 5 min eur/usd chart, got into 5 sells, none had crossed over the upper green cog line. 1 at 18:40, 3 at 18:41, 1 at 18:58. Something don't sound right. It looks like the ema cross was there, and it crossed the center cog line. I will get a picture next time.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I have been trading this system for several months, I have been trading ma's for a long time but this is the best approach as of yet.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I typically will trade any cross right around the green lines after a bar close below/above the green line, so for a long look for price to close below the bottom green line and then trade any cross after that as long it is right around the green or gold lines. This will give you the best results by far.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I should have an ea specifically for this strategy in a few days that I will post. I should have it done and tested by the end of the week.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
well, just reviewing. change your hedge to 1. Also, you are correct. It looks good but does not test out. so..hmm...Halfway there! try this....it picks up the values better.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi, I think the long MA value in the code is 14 but it should be 13. please take a look. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi there, very intersting. Can I ask, why do you trade some on the 1 hr and some on the 4 hr? I mean, what is your creteria to put a pair in the 1 hr catagory vs the 4H category? Regarding signal cross, I have set a rule that it must happen above median line for short (after price has closed above upper band) and vice versa for long, is that ok by your experience? (As sometimes the cross itself dosen't happen abvoe the upper band but are a bit postponed) Thank's in advance, PC

--- 帖子 #80 ---
ok, changed to hedge level 1, still opened 4 sells and a sell stop, and there was no cross of the green cog lines, see picture.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
As somewhat of a nubie I'm having trouble finding the code or even a platform that had the COG envelopes or averages. All I can find is a COG osillator, Any help would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi. This is a COG indicator for Metatrader4 platform. I hope this help. sorry for my english.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Thank you it will help

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I've been following this thread with interest. I've got a few questions 1) people say that the cog indicator repaints, do we know how exactly this acts? As in I look at the previous ticks of the 4H chart and just about every trade looks in the money, is this due in part to the repaints? *** Edit: After using a quick test of Vhands, this is most certainly the case. Hindsight is 20/20 in this case *** 2) I've been looking around and found a little info on the CG oscillator but I've not found any info on this COG indicator, can anybody point me in the direction of the mechanics of this thing? Where did it come from? 3) I'm going to start doing a little back testing using the Vhands method. Will this work for a repainting indicator? Thanks guys, here hoping that we can catch some pips out of this method. Stu

--- 帖子 #85 ---
sorry, still having trouble with it ... others go ahead and take a stab.. The repainting seems to be quite a bit.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The time frame is a personal preference, I find some pairs seem to work better on the 1hr vs. the 4 hr and vice versa. This system works on any time frame. In terms of when the EMA cross happens you have must have the cross above the upper or lower band, depending on long vs short. If for example I am using the green upper band I want price to cross above the green upper band before i start looking for ema crosses, I want the ema cross to be right around or above the green line, if it is just below the green line it is ok too to place a short trade.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Stu great questions. Regarding repainting, yes it repaints, but it does not repaint that much. In my opinion the only way to test a strategy is to forward test it, most strategies work in back testing. I am still trying to understand the math behind the COG the basic premise is that price will come back towards the blue line.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
endroute, you wrote: "...I have been using an ma ea to email me ema crosses only but I only run it on a few charts as I would be getting a ton of alerts." You can have MT4 email you when there is a MA cross? I had no idea this could be done? How can I set it up? Thanks for all of your patience, help, and this great thread. -piperomia

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Endroute, I also have been reading this thread with great interest and really wanted to comment a couple times, but I have been in "FF purgatory" the last two weeks. I inadvertently mentioned a commercial Forex product in a response to another trader and got banned from posting for two weeks.... grrrr. So it's nice to be on the "outside" again. LOL Some of my questions have been answered, but I also wondered if you wait until you get an EMA 5/13 cross AFTER a candle closes (so that the cross is permanently on the chart)? There have been a couple times where there was a brief cross on the hourly TF only to reverse before the candle was done so that there ended up being no cross afterall. I would imagine this happens on the 4H TF even more frequently. Can you give some clarity on that? Many thanks for the great system. Scott

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Attached is an ema crossover indicator, you should already have the emas on your charts. On a related note I should have a working version of a EA that will email you when trading opportunities are present with this system, I should have this tomorrow. The initial EA will not place and manage trades, After some testing the EA will be setup to close trades at the next EMA cross, but the EA should not be used to open trades by itself.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Scott, Wait for the candle to close before entering the trade, you are quite right in that sometimes you can get faked out. Be patient if you don't get it on this trade there are always more trades, this was my biggest challenge when I first started trading I wanted to rush into trades, with this method there are several good trades per day on the pairs I watch and lots more on the pairs I don't.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thanks, endroute. I have learned the same thing. By the way, speaking of opportunities, did you see any today? I wasn't glued to my terminal, but I sure didn't notice any proper setups on my end. Now you are trading two currencies that I am not, so maybe there were some there (as far as I can tell, IBFX doesn't offer two of the pairs you trade). Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Please don't think that just because I am not trading a given pair with this system that it does not work on that pair, this approach will work on any pair. I trade the pairs I trade not out of any sort of empirical data that says I can make more money on these pairs, but because these are the pairs that have been on my charts since the beginning of time and that putting more pairs on is more work that I don't want to do at this point, but once I get the EA finished that will alert me to trade setups that I can then look and decide whether or not to trade then I may look at other pairs to see how they do relative to the pairs I follow. At a certain point it is just easier and less risky to just add more lots to your trades instead of more currency pairs and therefore trades, however this is a personal decision that only you can make.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
No, no. I understand that fully. I just wanted to see if you saw any setups today on any of your pairs to make sure that I am seeing (or not seeing) the same things you are and thus properly trading the system. Cheers, Scott

--- 帖子 #95 ---
No worries, I took today off from new trades. I will start posting charts tommorrow.

Hi 4xWeezal, I took a stab at the ea and it seems to work ok. I haven't put anything fancy in it yet and I am just using a Take Profit and StopLoss. Maybe we can put something together if it helps. Of course I can't do anything about the repainting but the entries are correct at the time.

MA doesnt work. Copied to IBFX\EXPERTS\INDICATORS\ and produces nothing. Please advise..thx

Hi waltini1, I looked into your code and it looks promising. After reading a post endroute post earlier today, I understand that you set the buy rule to cross below the lower green band and opposite for the sell. You don't check if it crossed back. I think it is right, but it will be great if endroute will give his opinion about it. endroute wrote " In terms of when the EMA cross happens you have must have the cross above the upper or lower band, depending on long vs short. If for example I am using the green upper band I want price to cross above the green upper band before i start looking for ema crosses, I want the ema cross to be right around or above the green line, if it is just below the green line it is ok too to place a short trade ." BTW, can you consider creating an indicator that just alerts when there is a good setup ? BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
it is an ea, you need to open the file with the Metaquotes Language Editor, under the tools tab, compile it, and it should show up under the expert advisors tab, double click to apply it to open chart of your choice.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Ok, here is a EURJPY short trade I took today on a demo account. It is hard to tell from the screenshot, but the candles had moved above the top green line prior to the EMA cross. I entered on the finished candle after the cross (166.27). The price action immediately went in my favor, and I was in profit by as much as 62 pips before it turned and went back the other way. I closed on the finished candle of the reverse EMA cross for a loss of about 26 pips. Endroute, should we perhaps consider either of the following? 1) A trailing stop loss. In the above trade, a 30-point trailing stop would have finished the trade at around +30 pips. 2) A rule that once the trade moves significantly in your favor (say 20 points), you create a SL at break even. Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hey Scott, I noticed your screen shot on the EJ pair. Nice idea about TP levels. Attached you will see my screen shot, it shows "no trade". I am using the COG settings that were posted...are you using these the same settings? We both seem to be using the 1 hr TF with IBFX. Thanks. Leo

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi, Skygod. Yes, my COG settings are correct. I doublechecked them, in fact, after that trade. You have to remember that the COG indicator repaints as time goes by. If you had looked at your chart back when the 5 EMA actually crossed down over the 13 EMA, you would have seen that the price action had previously been above the top green line, signaling that conditions were right for an entry. I should have taken a screenshot of the chart at the time of entry. Next time I will. Scott

--- 帖子 #106 ---
So here is a trade I took today on EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Scott, Your trade went south because you should not have taken it, price never closed above the upper green line. Always wait for price to close above the upper green lines for a short

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Sorry, endroute, but you're wrong on that. The price DID close above the upper green line. I would never have entered it otherwise. Those COG lines shifted over the next two hours on the chart. Surely you realize that they do that (repaint). Scott

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Scott, I have never seen an indicator which repainted so thoroughly. Try putting my ea on a chart on the backtester, set up the indicators and then watch the COG. You could use the same method to capture a screen shot of your abovementioned trade by stopping the backtester where required. Anyway it is working well for endroute so good luck to him.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi endroute, You wrote that the system works both in trending &amp; non trending markets. From the last days charts, I see that in non-trending markets, the prices are around the COG blue line, or crosses the greens up and down. I assume non of these is a valid signal. So what is the way you trade this markets ? do you change the TF up/down to find a valid trade ? BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I could be, I just did not remember seeing a setup on that pair at 8am yesterday.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I don't trust the backtesting. Better just to keep an eye on it going forward. Looking at the same chart this morning (in real time), I see the top green line has moved up quite a bit more so that the bars in question now are sitting under the middle blue line. So there is no question that they are moving quite a bit. I've attached the chart. And I never suggested that the trade "didn't work". As I said, that trade was in profit by 62 pips. I was just exploring ideas for capturing some of those pips or at least getting out at break even when it reversed. Scott

--- 帖子 #113 ---
No worries, man.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Scott, I think that once the price went 20-30 pips in your favor, the minimal action you should have taken was to move the SL to BE. If you can't attend your computer, place a TS but never let the price go against you 80 pips. As I see it, if your initial SL was 20+spread, Never let the price fall more then 30 pips before you close your position. Off course, It is just my opinion. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
And a good opinion, I think. I share your views. I'm just trying to feel this system out and was just wondering out loud if those "rules" should be added to the system. Endroute has been trading this a lot longer than any of the rest of us presumably, so was kind of hoping he would weigh in on whether that was recommended or not. Scott

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Dani, Try this, it is pretty self explanatory. This is still an ea but can be used as an alarm only if required. Very quickly put together so let me know what doesn't work

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I have read some of the comments lately about taking profits when you have profits. I have been trading this system for about two weeks now (which is not a long time but) what i have noticed so far is: If you overide your emotional decision making and just trade your plan, you will have a few some small losses but then you will have 1 or 2 large to very large winners that will make-up for the loosers. I trade the 15 min with candles closing above or below the green lines and ema crosses above and below the greens but only if the 1hr candle closes below or above the greens. Although I dont need to have an ema cross on the 1hr just a close above or below the greens. So if you are trading the 1hr maybe look at 4hr for confirmation, I dont know just a suggestion. This will cut down on the number of trades you take but it may make you more profitable. So far this system looks good to me. Thanks endroute. P.S. I enter and take profit only on ema crosses.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi waltini1, Thanks for the modified EA. I put it on the charts, and wait to see the results. It may take some time as I trade 1H &amp; 4H as addroute does. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I hate trailing s/l's this is a personal preference of mine, I have found over the years that they really limit your upside, now are you going to loose a few pips now and again yes but that happens everywhere. As I said in an earlier post I tend to watch my trades, gotta love web enabled phones, but if you are going to be away s/ls and trailing s/ls are useful and I will use them in those situations. Now with this all said I have an EA for this, that I would like your help in testing, and if anyone can get the sendmail function to actually work and not send an email at every tick that would be great too but just when a trade entry opens that would be cool, I have taken out the email alert function because of this.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
If you like this on the 15 trade this on the 5 but only take trades when the price is above the gold line for sells, and below the gold for buys but wait for the crosses, as occassionaly the trade will go the other way. This is a pretty surefire way to make 100 pips a day on eur/jpy or usd/jpy without much risk on the shorter TFs. You hit the nail on the head about emotion, if you are going to trade you are going to have some loosers. What everyone should be doing is trading with a plan and a system that you are very comfortable with and then stick to that plan and system no matter what. If that means starting with a micro account and working your way up as your confidence grows then so be it. You have to have patience to trade the longer tfs with this or any system. I still recomend to everyone that they stay in untill the next ema cross when trading the higher tfs, on the lower tf you can use the next ema cross but you are going to sacrifice a few pips so using an oscillator or something may work. My advice is to just trade the timeframe you are in, you can try and correlate to another tf but sometimes its hard to figure out.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
thanks - waltini1 n.. I appreciate your work. that ea will work for now- im sure. . I am running my own..I have yet to come up with the right ea getin/ combo to make this work well. I really like the greens versus the yellow as its more trades but the repainting is intense and hard to control.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hello endroute, Just a quick question about your 5 &amp; 13 EMA's. Are they both applied to the close price or is the 5 applied to close and the 13 to open ? Nice system, thanks.....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Both to close

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Ah but when price is above the yellow you typically get a much much better trade for a lot more pips, yes fewer trades but more pips and less risk.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I added a trailing stop, set to 0 to disable.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Is this indicator suppose to provide an audible alert??

--- 帖子 #127 ---
what kind of stop loss do you use on the 1 hour? Also, I agree on the yellows as the appear to give the best moves - but I think the 5-13 cross on a short for example (with a lookback that is closes above the green with an ema can give you a good shot at it. We ill see... I think the trade has to open below the blue line for a long vice versa for a short...Anyway, I kind of like it so far. Well see if it makes profit or not.! for the shorter tf's,,,I agree that you would need to use an oscillator for a close..ma's on shorter tf's are a little late a lot of the times. It should be pretty good though... I like the ema's that start at top of moves... ie above the pivot for example and sell through it and close below with a larger trend.. typically i only get a few of those a week.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi mogul4x, Firstly it is an EA not an indicator, and yes it has an audible alert and a box will pop up on your screen and tell you what is happening. It can be used to take trades and/or as an alarm.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi friends, Lets start posting trades we take based on the system rules. This way we can all learn from each other, as a picture is batter then a 1000 written words. I'll start with a losing long trade I took a few hours ago on EurGbp 4H chart. If you have comments, please post them. Thanks, Dani M.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Looks valid to me. The candles closed below the green line and the EMA's crossed up so he went long... Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Will check out COG this weekend with this system. Awhile back I had tried using it, but had found it to be non-tradeable.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Agreed, if trading according to post #1 rules....confusion reigns.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Yes. Installed as EA. Havent seen nor heard alert yet. Installed yesterday. When is the alert suppose to occur? thx

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I'm not a big indicator trader, but I admit this is rather interesting. I set up a page of pairs with the COG and watched for the past couple days. It seems like most of the time the green boundaries repell price with no close above. I'm curious if you've had any setups Wed, Thur because I saw no closes above or below. Thanks for Sharing

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Dan_Mir You did well despite this being a small loss, you followed the rules of the system, the previous 2 EMA crosses would have bagged you about a 16% equity gain if you had taken them. Forex is all about losing, the key to it is maximising the gain when you win. If you have a risk/reward ratio of 3:1 then you only need to win about 25% of your trades to be massively in profit. From what Ive seen this simple set of rules is right more than it is wrong... If you have the discipline to follow the system rules you will be massively ahead over the long term. If you fall into holy grail syndrome then money will leak from your account as you add filter upon filter and move away from a robust and easily traded (thus repeatable) method. Nice work! cheers Crom

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well said, Crom. I agree 100%. No system is perfect. This one seems to win much more than it loses. Given that and the fact that the wins are usually much bigger than the losses, trading the plan with discipline is all that is necessary. I just finished my own EA (it seems the thing to do on this thread!), and it has some nice features, I think: • Opens AND closes trades automatically • Option to use SL and TP or not (off by default) • Can set how many bars back the price could have closed above/below COG • Can set how far back into the COG area fast EMA can go and still have a valid trade signal • Error checking • Monitors orders -- limits system to one trade per EA instance and can still work with trades if EA has been shut down and restarted. • Will probably add alarm/email options this weekend I tested it on the 5M TF last night just so I could make sure it worked like it was supposed to. It didn't have very good results on that TF since it was using the green COG lines (though it did usually go into profit before closing at a loss). I'm going to test it on the 1H next week. If it works decent, I will post it. Scott

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi waltini1, I'm running your EA V2 for testing on a real account with small lot fractions. Any idea why didn't it triggered a trade in the attached picture ? Dani M.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Dani, you must be thinking of someone else's EA as I have not posted mine yet. Cheers, Scott

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Tried the same EA does not work.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Friends, The week comes to an end for me. I will attach a series of the same charts endroute trades, with all the possible trades. As you can see, some pairs gave very good results, while others were awful. The popular GbpJpy was un-tradeable this week. Thanks all for your posts, Dani M

--- 帖子 #141 ---
The rest of the charts

--- 帖子 #142 ---
not sure why it would nt have. I believe you wanted the close of the candle to be below the gold so it may not have. ALso, on the ma cross does it have to confirm with a complete closs or just have a touch cross? hmm debate, debate debate....!!! Also, I am leaning toward a 4 bar lookback as probably the best. I really like this sytem. thanks for all the input so far especially from endroute..i think I will go live next week with a micro .05 -.15 cts per pip to test it out on the 1 hour. should be fun!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hey guys I will try to begin posting charts as I take trades next week, this should help to clear up any confusion, I hope.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
thanks, if there are any trades you don't take with a cross, I appreciate your feedback. I think this system is very good.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
If you don't mind my asking, how did you fare this past week, endroute (wins vs. losses, net pips, and did you trade mainly 1H or 4H or a combination)? Also, can you quantify how many bars back you will allow for a cross of the upper/lower green COG and it still be a valid signal? I see 4xWeezal thinks 4 bars makes the most sense. I had sort of planned to set my EA on 6 for next week to allow it a little more latitude. Do you have a recommendation? Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #146 ---
As for non-trending (aka) ranging mkt..i suggest u should use ADX for filter out... sonic

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi guys... just to add on some indi to this system... this works great for me... I'm using 1H chart... sometimes 15 min TF... I add 3 indi just work great when you combine with this system... 1) Gan HiLo (10)... (2) MACD color ( 5,13,1 )... (3) Lagguerre 0.6.... Rules still same... Sell when price closed over green line/orange line of COG.. may be to wait EMA crossed it's take time... so you can enter first lot when price closed below line Gan HiLo, Lagguere pointed down below 0.85, MACD red color pointed down or crossed zero... Normally when EMA crossed price sometimes retrace and try to test again swing high before... Enter 1 more lot when price goes same direction as EMA... Exit strategy... 1) Close first lot when price closed below bottom green line/ orange line of COG 2) Remain lot exit when at divergence situation or reverse signal ... price closed over Gan Hilo/ Lagguerre pointed up from 0.15/ MACD crossed above 0 or EMA crossed opposite direction... for Buy viceversa.. Here I attach the situation where to enter trade and exit trade... red line sell... blue line buy... sori my english...

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Whoa... you just took a very simple system and made it complicated. Just how much better results are you getting with it? Scott

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I know this is simple system... for me before i use this system i'm also try auslanco's strategy that use Gan HiLo... Imran... Lagguerre and 4H MACD by Philips... so when i see i got early signal from gan hi lo and Lag i enter the trade... when ema crossed so i know i'm in the right track... so i add on one more lot... exit strategy... depends on person... just to share my strategy...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Roselyn, the lag_exp_1b1.mq4 you attached is an EA not an indicator

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Sorry... my mistake... already edit the indicator for Lagguere.... see my previous attachments...

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thank you Roselyn

--- 帖子 #153 ---
thanks roselyn... i will be adding those into system. ive never used gan/ hi/lo so that is something new.... wonderful thread. also, i think lag would be under .60 or it might be late for a long / thoughts on that --- lot of good confirming signals. i think just a touch to the mov average with the rest will be great. the macd seems a little excessive as there are some big crosses. thoughts on the retrace of those thanks again roselyn

--- 帖子 #154 ---
What EMAs are you using in the indicator EMA Cross

--- 帖子 #155 ---
On paper this is a really good system I like the cog giving an indication to the ema Can I suggest that an exit point initially should be the other green line unless the crossover takes place before that point. Looking at the relevant currencies they appear to bounce of the opposite green line. This of course is looking at the static charts and have still to see what happens when the cog as be redrawn during active trading

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Friends, I'm writing my very own opinion, and you don't have to agree with me, but I think that we have a problem. Lately,some people here, took a very simple yet profitable system, and before trading the system live for even a week, started hacking, "improving", customizing, adding indicators, etc, etc, etc. I don't think that was the initial reason for endroute to establish this tread. He wanted the system to remain intact and asked for assistance building an EA for the system. I think this is the way must of the subscribers of this thread want things to remain. Simple and profitable. If you want to build your own complicated yet non profitable proven system, go ahead. Create a new thread. SeekingLight, One of the best writers in FF wrote about this phenomenon. Take a minute and read his excellent post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=88957 . read the first and the seventh posts. As I said, this is my opinion and it represents my feeling, unless you share it and agree with me. BR Dani M

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I was thinking the exact same thing, Dani. Out of respect for endroute and his original system, if people are going to be adding a bunch of indicators and other stuff, they need to start a new thread because at that point it becomes a NEW system and shouldn't be confused with the system originally presented in this thread. All it does is create confusion for everyone following the thread. The fact is that endroute says he has been successful for several months (live) with the system he presented in the first post, and we need to let THAT system run its course here before tampering with it. Just my $.02. Scott

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Dear Thread, Being an eSignal guy, can anyone point me in the right direction for the COG? And, if not, what is a proper replacement for it? Thanks, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I see your point guys but with all due respect I think Roselyn was just pointing out something that is working well for her/him(?). Take it or leave it no one told you you had to use Roselyns ideas. I don't think you should jump Roselyns back until the creator of this thread has had time to respond to her ideas. Have you even tested it yourself? If you can't take this information in, test it yourself and then make your own opinion on what to do then why are you even trading? Personally I haven't tested it either... for now I am sticking with the original idea to see how it goes. And guess what if it fails I know theres a post there with a fresh new approach to try. If we are too scared to share our ideas for the fear of being shut down by posts such as yours then how can we ever be dynamic in this dynamic environment we work in. Just my opinion I would be interested to know endroutes opinion on this. Endroute?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I'm inclined to disagree Cindy. I reckon we should let this system run its course before changing it beyond recognition. After all, if it as good as endroute appears to suggest, I would rather we ironed out any deficincies in the way we apply it rather than clutter it beyond recognition. Just an opinion.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
fair enough i see both sides i guess - but for what its worth no ones changed anything the original system is still clear but there are some extra ideas for anyone who wants to try them... Anyway - I'm watching GC and GJ closely as they have both crossed trhe upper line of the COG...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Which crosses are you tracking Cindy? Any thoughts on the COG repainting?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I haven't actually tracked this in real time so this week and next I will demo trade it so i'm not sure about the repainting... There was a trade posted earlier in the thread on the 4hr chart of the EUR/GBP I thnk it was that turned into a loser. I checked it on my charts and from what I saw there it never crossed the COG. ( a totally different picture from what was posted) So either the person that posted that trade was using the wrong settings or this thing repaints A LOT!!! Tracking GJ, GU, GC, NU AU EJ EU UJ and AJ One thing ive noticed is that if the price touches the middle line before he MA's cross it is a sign that it's too late - no trade. Just an observation again I'd love to hear Enroutes opinion on this.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi waltini1, I'm using your v3 of the EA, and I saw several legitimate trades non triggered. I checked the your code and saw that you require the price to be above/below the green line, while the rules require the EMA cross to meet above/below, not the price itself. as long as I understand. if(Buy1 &amp;&amp; Buy2 &amp;&amp; Ask &lt; COGLower1 &amp;&amp; OrdersTotal()&lt;1 &amp;&amp; TakeTrade) If I'm right, I think you have change your EA again. sorry. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Changed!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi endroute, I did a little change in your EA code in order to expose the boolean option of TP and SL along with their required number of pips. The option to select the lot size was exposed as well. I hope you don't mind. I called it ednroute1. BR, Dani M.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi everybody I m a newbie, and i want to thank all of you for the great contribution an d the education you are giving to people like me. I have been in many forums, but this is the best forum, which has helped me in learning how to start trading. I have just discovered that the MA's are the greatest tools to use. I have just read Endroute system which sounds great i will try it, but i don't know how to use the COG and how to fix it in my plateform. Please help me . Thanks alot . May God bless you all. Sema2008

--- 帖子 #168 ---
HI Sema to put the indicator in your platform is very simple - First of all you need an MT4 platform I don't know what you have but I use interbank fx demo account just for my charts but place my trades with a different broker. Then just click on the indiator download link - click save - go to my computer - hard drive - program files - find your trading platform folder (in my case it's Interbank fx) - double click! - go to experts - indicators and save it in there... Then close your platform and re open it and the COG should appear in your Custom indicators list. (Indicators - Custom) Bam that's it. You say you just learned that MA's are the best indicator to use - why? because you read it here? just from personal experience don't believe anything just because you read it. Take the time to learn see and judge for yourself what works best FOR YOU- What works well for one person might not work so well for the next. Good luck

--- 帖子 #169 ---
If people want to change the system have at it, if you want to throw more indicators at it in the hopes of filtering out those few and relatively far between losses thats great, but you will probably also end up filtering out good trades too. To be successful traders we each have to develop systems that work for us, it is the rare new trader that can pick a system and trade it as well as the person that developed it. I too was in the same boat when I first started trading I thought that every system I found I could improve upon by adding more to it, what I learned in trying all of those things was how the different indi's worked and started developing my own systems that I could actually trade profitably. By the way it looks like there may be a good setup on the EURGBP and maybe the nzdjpy in next few hours

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Wonderful charts Dani, I hope you caught all of those trades. Because trading any market involves human emotion, there is no system which is right all the time. You need to tip the odds in your favour and here you have a simple method for entering and exiting the market which you can repeat time and again with as little discretion as possible. Kudos to endroute for pointing out a very simple, highly visual, and easily repeatable trading model. cheers Crom

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi CindyXXXX, Thks alot for the COG i will put it in my platform. I m using mt4 quotes for my demo . I have not gone live. I m practising with the demo.I m also learning the mt4 platform. When i started i traded live ,i lost all my money so now i just want to learn before i trade live again.About the MA's i have tried afew like 55 and 8 and they give you good entry and exit.Also 200 and 60. Thks sema2008

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Noone suggested that we couldn't "take this information in" or that people should be scared to share their ideas. Those are strawmen. Hey, I welcome new ideas and even variations of this method. I would love to hear Roselyn talk more about her particular method and show some chart examples. BUT NOT HERE. She should start a new thread for that. It's one thing to talk about minor suggestions to the system (fine-tuning SL and TP, for instance). It's another matter altogether when we're talking about adding 2-3 indicators. That's a different system, IMO. Good trading, all. Scott

--- 帖子 #173 ---
OK Henryfam I see your point -

--- 帖子 #174 ---
can you attach the template as well? thx

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Amen This thread should be kept for the original method as described by endroute...

HI, Would someone be kind enough to convert the Center Of Gravity.MQ4 indicator fot the VT plarform ? TIA I benefit from this opportunity to thank ENDROUTE very strongely for elaborating and sharing with us this very efficient trading system Best regards

--- 帖子 #177 ---
5 min candle usd/jpy price crossed over the top yellow line and closed. cross of 5/13 and signal at 108.16 will report the status after trade ends. please see attachment thanks

--- 帖子 #178 ---
when trading on the 5min only take trades where the crosses are above the green line for shorts and below for longs. This is actually a good rule of thumb for all timeframes

--- 帖子 #179 ---
If you are in this to make real pips, trade the hour/4hr timeframes. There were over 2K pips to be had last week on this system, that is 2K trading mini account or 20K trading a standard account. Also on the shorter timeframes you end up trading a lot more and opening yourself up to more risk. Yes I do trade the 5min charts sometimes but only when price has closed well above the gold line followed by a cross between gold and green. Just some food for thought.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
you can change the period... if you want to follow this system .. so just use EMA 5 and EMA 13...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I have just started reading this particular thread. Lots of good info on it. Good point by endroute about particular systems not always working like they should for other people. FXT

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I agree with you... I don't means to disturb Endroute thread here... just to share how I combine his strategy... Sorry guys...

I do agree and this is a good system,and the smaller time frames are death' you miss the big picture. Oh And Thanks bud

I am a fan of MAs (5/13,6/12,2/4 etc)and I think endroute,s system with the cog is great and simple. I have gone thru all the pages in this thread and quite enjoyed it. Will demo the system and see how it goes, great work.THE EMPEROR

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Endroute, If you can, please post any trades you are taking as they occur. Am I correct in saying there have been no valid trades on the 1H TF as yet today? The EURGBP had a cross, but now that the COG has repainted, none of the bars finished outside the lower green line, so no trade I assume. Thanks, Scott

Yes some examples would be helpful... I went short on GU 5m on a MA cross that was above the green line at the time of the cross... But now the cross i entered on is under the blue line after the repaint!! Is this common and still a valid trade or what? Cheers

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Scott, You are right. no trades today on 1H and above time frames. I took some trades on 15M, but endroutes comment about limiting the trades to the golden line, came a little late for me and I lost some bucks. Take care Dani M.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
No good trades today as of yet.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Are the settings as follows: 240,4,0,1.0,500 And - Do we use default for 4 hr charts Thought i saw nzd/jpy real time close above green - repainted a couple hrs later. regards GD

--- 帖子 #190 ---
As a follow up to my settings post I show the GBP/USD with mulitple closes right now above green line so my settings must be wrong. regards

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The repainting seems to be an issue yet I reckon this indicator (COG) just might work if we're able to get round (or minimise) that issue. You guys reckon it might be possible to tweak (recode) COG?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Guys, We just got a valid signal (I believe) on the EURCAD pair. Correct me if I am wrong, endroute. I just bought it, so we'll see how the trade goes. I've attached the chart at the time of entry. Scott

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Scott, I haven't followed this pair, But you are in the pips and the setup was good.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Euro cad/8 point pip spread on interbank... a little too rich. what tf? 15 mn? if you don't like to wait too long for the gold (instead of green) you can always stretch the greens out to 1.5 on kstd. Obviously, not as safe. Also, I think that on the smaller timeframes if you do try to trade the greens ...you want to open above the "blue line" . . that way if you get a big push on the 1 hour or a big move, you don't get late to the party and still get in on the retracement.. saved me today. Again, the original is best -- thanks for shareing endroute!. Lot of pips to slay. by the time this thread is done .. I expect about 10 million hits.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi, Thanks to Enroute &amp; all in this thread. I love working with MAs and this system is great but am frustrated cos I can't get the COG indi to showup after installation according to CindyXXX earlier instructions. Even the drag method from desktop does not work. Yeah, tried opening before saving to view, still does not appear. Am using IBFX MT4 demo. Am missing a lot. May some kind soul out there please help. Thanks and may God Blessed all with Blessed Pips.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
1H TF. I think a large spread becomes less of an issue on the 1H and higher timeframes. As endroute says, we're looking for the bigger moves here. Scott

--- 帖子 #197 ---
BP, Do you see the COG indicator listed under "Custom Indicators" in your Navigator window? Scott

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi All, Thanks to endroute for bringing up this method.... Simple &amp; so profitable. I am going to try this method &amp; will try to be patient on putting the trade. (My only enemy is my patience.... Impatience will bring bad trade) Good Luck All....

--- 帖子 #199 ---
ya.. same as me... now must be more patience... is it EUR/USD and EUR/CHF a good set up for BUY if EMA cross up since now the price below bottom gold line for EUR/USD... Need endroute advice..

--- 帖子 #200 ---
hi, Please correct me if I'm wrong - 1. The rules of the system requires to wait for the candle to close before getting in. 2. Both of the published EA's (maltini1 &amp; endroute), I saw trades being triggered way before the candle ended, causing unwanted trades. I have a current example of a buy trade on EU 1H triggered at 09:40 (ODL - GMT). It could be a winner, but the schedule is wrong. What do you think? BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Dear Endroute and Thread, No replies about COG in eSignal and I can't find it either. That being said, could one use Bollinger Bands or some other band indicator as a replacement for the COG? If so, which band indicator and which settings. Would appreciate the heads-up here. Thanks very much and sorry for any bother by anyone. Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Are we supposed to change the settings as pointed out on another post? GBP/USD looks really scewed right now on COG thanks RWX

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi endroute, your system looks like very promising. About the ema cross, you enter the trade just on cross or you wait candle close to confirm the cross? Thanks, Luca

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Lenoxer, you have two options as I see it: 1. Use a MT4 demo for getting the signals, and place your trades manually on eSignal. I know some people doing it with many systems facing your problem. 2. If you have programing abilities, the source code for COG can be found in the paper clip of this thread. Take it &amp; convert it to eSignal. The math is simple. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Dear Dani M., Thanks very much. How do I access that code? I have a programmer who can do it for esignal for me. Thanks again, Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #206 ---
There you are - good luck Dani M.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
OK, so usd/chf has closed above COG boundary. Data is coming however.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
The image on first post shows something else than that of indicator. Can any one explain how can I set the setting shown in first post on first page?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Dani, yes, the candle needs to close. Scott

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Wait for candle close, Luca. Scott

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Well, this trade didn't end up too great. After being up around 50 pips initially, I ended up losing 54 (that includes the spread). I am still wondering if a trailing stop is a good thing to implement. I would have gotten out with at least a few positive pips. My EA also took a long GBPJPY trade in the middle of the night here (7:00 GMT) which immediately reversed and nailed me for 42 pips. Looking at that chart now, I can't see how the prices could have been below the lower green COG line, but I know this thing does repaint a lot, and my EA is under strict orders not to take long trades unless that condition occurs. The EA just opened a third trade on EURCHF which is still going and is currently in profit by about 20 pips. Will keep you posted. You taken any trades yet, endroute? Scott

--- 帖子 #212 ---
dear traders...look at EUR/USD i wonder is it good set up for buy if EMA cross in 1H Tf... need opinion..

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Scott, What EA do you use ? Dani M.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
endroute... thanks for sharing this system... need your opinion please... thanks...

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I got nailed by the gbpjpy trade too, my ea took it too, I did not catch the eurchf trade. The past few days have been crappy trading conditions.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Drop in GBP, due to the news from BOE on inflation.... Luckily I did not trade....

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Dani, I use one that I created last week. It is still a work in progress, but the basics seem to work well. It opens and closes trades without issue. Scott

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Maybe we need to build in a filter to avoid taking trades and/or placing protective stops around news times for various currencies. Scott

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Roselyn: Yes, this is a good setup. Wait for candle to close after cross, though. Scott

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi theHenryfam! Thanks for replying, just got it done. Now, am facing another problem. When insert the EMAs 5 and 8, they show up only on the lower time frames, and total blank on the H1, H4 charts. Thot am supposted to have to go back down to lower time frames to check but ob checking the charts shown on this thread it is not so. How do I go about it? Happy Pipping one and all.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Is there a trade on EUR/USD. A long one.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Not quite yet. At the last 1H candle close, the 5 was still a hair under the 13. Scott

--- 帖子 #223 ---
thanks for reply.. did you take any trade today..

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yes. My EA took a GBP/JPY trade about 3AM ET but it immediately reversed because of some inflation news from the Bank of England (-42 pips there). I also am in a EUR/CHF trade right now that is profitable (currently up about 30). My EA took that one at 6AM ET. There are several other trades setting up right now... Scott

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Looks like the EU is crossing up right now... Wait for the candle to close.... Ready to buy....

Hi, Me again, solved the MA problem. Thanks. Happy Pipping to all.

Here I put my trade on EU (setup spotted on). Attached on trading time. Good Luck Guys.... -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Great thread! I was trying to stick to the higher time frames but this one looks to good to pass up! we'll see.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
maybe not!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
This system really looks good, but im little worried i must confess about the repainting i have bad experience from other repainting indicators first u have a go a buy signal then a little later it repaints and the signal u had before does not exist. Haven`t any of you had this problem yet ? also what is a good stopploss for 1h tinme frame ? best regards and thanks for a great system

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Greetings. 1) Yes, repainting occurs, and I have experienced it. I think endroute's response to that has been that it doesn't really matter so much. The COG is used to get you into the trade at a good point. From that point on it doesn't really matter a whole lot what the COG does (though he does suggest considering an exit if price hits the opposite band). I can vouch for this approach. I have entered trades where the COG almost immediately repainted against me, but the trade went in my favor (at least for a while). 2) Endroute (the system's author) doesn't use a stoploss but closes at the reverse EMA cross. Early on I have experienced that this doesn't work great when the price is ranging. So I have just added a trailing stoploss of 30 points to my EA. So we'll see how that works out. Good trading, Scott

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Thanks. If i understand u right we just take the trade when the criteria in th first post described ocurs then if we little later look on cog and see that there is no buy signal anymore because it has change do to the repainting we ignore that because we have already got a signal and are in? the stopplos i was more thinking of a stopploss if the trade goes against us or move in the oposite direction ? best regards.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Exactly. Just do whatever you are comfortable with. I use 30 pips because I like to give it enough room to breath. Scott

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Scott, I have to correct you. endroute does place SL. He wrote he uses 20 pip for all the pairs he trades, except for GJ where he uses 50. I add the spread to these numbers to be on the safe side. As for TP, he waits for the EMA to cross. I agree with your first point. BTW, take a screen capture when you take the trade. That way, when you go over your trades at the end of the day, you can remember why did you take the trade. very easy in MT4. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
What does this EA do? Please explain or ref thread. thx

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Tanks for explain it to me i shall look moore into this it looks really nice shall look at in on the a few pair. Best regards

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi waltini1, I switched back to V3. I had too many bad trades, with V4 and endroute's EA as well. So, in order to be on the safe side, I want the most restrictive version, which is V3. Dani M BTW, you didn't answer my mail.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
9c trade system. I would like to know if you use the same COG settings for all time frames or it's just for 1Hour charts.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Dani, From the very first post of this thread, endroute states: "I typically do not set stop losses unless I am going to be away for a while, if I do I only set them at 20 - 50 pips depending on the pair I am trading, gbp/jpy gets 50 the rest 20."" So he sets them only if he isn't going to watch them. Scott

--- 帖子 #243 ---
OK, I probably missed the first sentense, but for me, not setting SL is too dangerous. I never trade without SL. It not that I don't believe in manual/mental SL, It is because I don't trust my Internet &amp; electricity providers !!! Dani M.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
And so it goes

--- 帖子 #245 ---
My long trades on EU &amp; AU still have gone up much yet (since 10 hrs ago).... EU up by 10 pips only &amp; AU up 10 pips (then down again.. but still +ve pips). Do I need to put SL or TS? If I need to, how much should be put? Thanks....

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I've set all my charts to 4 hr tf and have three trades in positive territory...buy eu-gb, 2 sells ...gb/jp and nz/us one yet to go positive...sell au/us. I'm erring on the side of trades that are close to the orange line with a nice strong angle as they retrace.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I reckon the stronger the angle, the less of an issue repainting becomes. Make sense?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Not sure on that ... Repainting is a big , big issue. Everything looks pretty in past tense. Obviously, nothing can predict future or we would all be rich!.. Still not sure if this is good yet. Over on a 4 hour , under on a 1 hour... direction is still a tough one.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
The COG reminds me of the liner regression channel with MT4 with the added advantage of curving with the trend. I'm going to play around with it to get a feel for its weaknesses. Thus far all my trades are in the right direction. Consequently, if you guys have any suggestions for working with the repainting drawback, I'ld be delighted.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Well, we have to live with repainting... I think the trick is to trust the backtesting on this. I am trading 1 hour stuff live .10-.15 cent pip stuff. - (green to green with crosss) so far mixed results but not much risk eithor so no sweat.. if the yellow cross showes up somewhere I might get bigger. Good luck. You could always play with bars back and "tighten" it up to 500 but its so early in this ea that can't make recommendation.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I'm resigned to repainting being a drawback (tolerable nuisance factor). The COG is still an awesome tool to have in my arsenal. Cheers endroute.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I stumbled across this thread earlier this evening, I have read it's entirety and can't wait to test it on demo tomorrow. If one looks at any trending time period in any market, we will see that a high/low ma cross can almost always mean mega pips. The problem has always been a decent filter to keep you away from the false signals. I hope that COG is that filter. I came across it a few months ago, didn't really give it any time and ended up dismissing it. A big big thanks to Endroute for your strategy and giving it some meaning.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
What is COG indicator, I have never heard of it and which platform offers it? Thanks for your response. My email address is: ROMANBL1@YAHOO.COM

--- 帖子 #254 ---
A lot of you here have commented on the repainting of COG, this is the way I see it. When you enter an amount in 'bars back' it plots curves based on the values between the 1st bar and the last bar, plus all in between. So, if we enter 240 as per Endroutes' strategy it makes a calculation based on the information in the last 240 bars. 0-240. Point 1. If we look at COG at a later time, eg, 30 bars later, COG is still showing calculations from the last 240 bars. In point 1 it was from bar 0 - bar 240, now (point 2) it is from bar 30 - bar 270. If we take a random bar, say bar 100. Its value (of all the bars) on a range of 0-240 will normally be different than its value (of all the bars) on a range of 30-270. I am not a mathematician in any shape or form but I see COG working (in terms of outcome) very similar to a moving average. One ma will give a different value to another (apart from the exact cross), due to the fact that they are formulating different information. Bar 100 in point 1 is calculated on different information to bar 130 in point 2, even though that bar and therefore it's values are identical. Its place in the big picture has changed, and, therefore COG repaints to show that change. For arguments sake lets pretend we start at zero and we know that each bar increases by 2.5 pips. In point 1, the 100th bar has a value of 250. COG gives that bar a value of 250, the COG curve is in proportion to it's place in 0-600 (240x2.5). In point 2 it's value is still 250, but now the COG curve is in proportion to it's place in 75 - 675. Off course most markets are like yo-yo's, hence the wave effect. I off course could be totally wrong and barking up the wrong tree! Won't be the first time. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Essentially the charts centre of gravity is shifting with time and consequently, each point in that chart also reflects that altered dynamic with the centre as the centre moves. So in effect repainting is a function of the plotting the centre. Ideally, a COG setting that finds the most extremes of move that consistently lie beyond its green parameters irrespective of future realignments of the centre, is what I had in mind. BTW 4xW, thanks for the suggestion.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I agree Weezal... If you come to this thread and then set up the indicators and look back at potential trades it feels like you just stumbled accross a gold mine but until you see this thing live you realize all those trades you see in hindsight prob weren't even there at the time (in realtime). It's funny to hear the excitement in the posts of newcomers - I felt the same way until I saw this live! Ive never seen a more useless indicator that is the COG and endroute still wondering when those few hundred pips a day are gonna kick in! Maybe there is another way to interpret the COG that I just haven't learn't but anyway thats my opinion.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
You cannot interpret a moving target cindy agreed...but the COG does have some uses for me and is good for my purposes to that degree.

[quote] Cindy, I bagged about 150 pips with this system yesterday. Yes the COG repaints, but I'm finding it is still a very useful filter. I also flick between a number of timeframes and make sure that a potential signal makes sense in the broader context. Endroute, thanks heaps for sharing your simple and straightforward system. Good trading to you! Kind Regards, Matt.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
You are a tuff chick Cindy but people here claim that they are making money so give it a chanse also there have been alot of explaing around the repainting i am also verry sceptic to it but some nice people explain it to me and im going to look at it when i have seen it in real action not backtesting just in real time i can say if it is for me or not. Best regards

--- 帖子 #261 ---
OK i agree give it a chance - And yes thanks Endroute for sharing your ideas sounds like this is working for some people so thats great.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
It will have its chance irrespective of what any of us contend cindy. If it adds value to even one trader on here, it will have served its purpose. However, like any indicator, it has its limits. Take it easy Darryl

--- 帖子 #263 ---
These systems can have ugly days. They must be traded over time to see positive reults. I'm not a big fan of this type of trading but found the indicator interesting. If it works for endroute thats great. I'll stick to s/r (leading), candles(leading) and macd for divergence (leading). Give me 20 pips a day and I'm happy. The market can trade any way it likes. Just me, RWX

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I would look at using the parabolic, another great way of filtering emas and without the repainting issues.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I would be VERY interested to know how you did this. My EA, which was programmed to trade using endroute's original rules, lost every trade it took yesterday. And I believe it took every possible signal (there were four or five, I think). Can you tell us which trades you took? And were you using the 1H or a smaller TF? Like Cindy, I'm a bit disenchanted at the moment. I was pretty gung-ho on this looking at the backtests, but it's a different story live. I see no way that this thing could get you hundreds, let alone, thousands of pips a week. I think in the days that I have been testing it (3 or 4 now?), either manual or with the EA, I've had only one winning trade. Don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, just being open and honest. So, to those of you having some success, please share the specifics. Thanks, Scott

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Friends, I think that currently the markets "misbehave". They refuse to feet our trading system. The worse thing we can do is change our trading system, but, we can change our MM. In trending markets, we have to let our profits run, and protect them using TS. In ranging / non directional markets, like we currently have, we have to protect our profit by using fixed TP levels. Bank 2/3 of the position at a clear TP level (S&amp;R, Pivot, Fibo, whatever), and let the last 1/3 run, with a SL at BE. Once we see that the number of trades the last 1/3 is a winner increasing, we understand the markets are trending again. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
ALL systems work nicely in trending markets, its how you deal with ranging conditions that are the make or break of most traders. I think to avoid frustration with being "stopped out" you should instead consider Risk to Reward. If you have risked 20 pips and are up 40-50 in a position then you shouldn't accept a loss. Then again I don't trade intraday due to the "noise" associated with smaller timeframes, liquidity issues around news releases causes huge spikes as brokers adjust their spreads , most retail intraday traders take a shoeing. As Dani M says, the WORST thing you can do is change your system, especially after only 4 days just because you are frustrated by the small losses. Try trading the higher timeframes, then the frequency of trades is reduced and signals TEND to be more reliable. Another thing is you have to get used to losing! NO system is a silver bullet, all we are exploiting is a TENDENCY within the market. Study TheRealThing's blogspot site to see how a professional trades. He has only had probably 40% winners this year yet his equity is 50% up. He did this by sticking to his rules and exploiting his edge. Note that he has used this method for years and occasionally has 6 week losing streaks, does he tinker with the rules or add more and more filters? Thought not. Trading should be kept simple and repeatable, almost boring, like any BUSINESS, the rest is up to the trader. Your "Holy Grail" is between your ears! Keep at it! cheers Crom

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Crom, all that you say rings true. I fully accept losses as part of playing the game. No problems there. And I don't recall anyone claiming this system was the holy grail. But the thing some of us are trying to figure out is how some on here claim to have made 100-150 pips on a day when the system's author said there were "no good trades." That's all. Scott

--- 帖子 #270 ---
So far I've just been using Endroutes COG settings, but trading in a fairly discretionary manner. I've been using the system like a framework to help see the possible scenario, and not trading strictly to the rules. This would definitely explain the difference between my results and an EA. I've been watching all of the pairs that Endroute mentioned in post 57: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...9&amp;postcount=57 I've been taking signals mainly from the 1hr and 4hr charts, but also taking a lead from the 30min and 15min. In particular, I've been looking for trades where multiple timeframes are lining up. I think this has got me into some trades quite early. When I recounted the pips it was actually around 130pips but US$1700 trading one lot. My trades yesterday (17th) were: - Buy EURGBP, 0.7896 08:48, exit 0.7942 13:19 +46 - Buy USDJPY, 108.08 08:50, exit 108.16 13:19 +8 - Sell AUDUSD, 0.9404 08:51, exit 0.9411 13:18 -7 - Sell GBPUSD, 1.9558 09:35, exit 1.9506 13:15 +52 - Buy EURJPY, 167.58 09:41, exit 167.68 13:19 +10 - Buy EURUSD 1.5501 13:20, exit 1.5521 15:56 +20 (hit TP after going to bed, lucky trade though) The times shown are from the ODL feed in MT4. I'm not sure if that's inline or ahead of GMT. I still need to work on my exits as I'm being very discretionary and could have got more pips, but so far the system is working quite well for me. I'm currently programming the COG into another charting package I use, so I'll be able to do some better and more flexible backtesting, and try to really understand how much impact the COG repainting really has. Endroute, do you have a list of trades which would have netted that 2200pips in a week? That would be very useful when doing the backtesting. Kind Regards, Matt.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Whoohaa.... this is Very simple yet powerfull systems thank's for sharing with us....

--- 帖子 #272 ---
In an effort to appease, ok not really, those that feel the COG sucks because it repaints I have found a suitable alternative. I actually started looking at this a while ago as I have had a terrible time getting an EA that will alert me to trading setups and closes using the COG, I think most of you guys use the EAs to actually trade. So while I don't use an ea to place trades I do use them to alert me to trades since well it allows me to play more golf, hang out with the fam, sleep etc vs watching charts or worrying that my EA is gonna screw me in a trade. Valid buy or long signals are when the parbolic is on the bottom and you have a cross up of the 5ema over the 13 and vice versa for sells or shorts. It is that simple. You will see a stochastic thead indi on the bottom I have been looking at using that to take trades ahead of the ema cross, in an effort to get more pips. So my friends the choice is yours right now I am trading both and trying to write an indi that works for the parabolic needless to say I suck as a developer, guess thats why I am a trader eh.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
yiha.. yeh sure buddy. Powerfull? remains to be seen.~ I think the yellow is good if you can catch a trade but I don't think there will be that many unless a big move happens also , as all can see if you trade live is that the repainting makes this an illusion of richers//I am trading he 1 hour above yeller but have not seen much action. Also, I am experimenting with the Green on the 15 mn and increasing the kstd in increments as that has the same affect....I think if someone could put this on a server and do a bar by bar backtest... they could come up with some optimal settings for cog by currency. thanks end route!! on the valid buys....I will add the parobolic to the system and see if gets better

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Endroute i have look in to it in haste but it appears that if the start of a new parabolic sar trend that is the first 3 dots or so and then the ema cross just before or right after (that is before parsar or in the first 3 dots or so) it appears to be the best signal. Also the parsar works better i think as a profit target just held the position untill the parsar change direction. just my thouts after a quick look. Have tryed before with rsi 21 and 50 and take position when it cross the 0 line but i think you parsar works better. Best regards

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Yes, I agree....I like the parobolic as an additive. .. Also, I don't want to throw endroutes system out the window as I understand conceptually the idea of what the cog is supposed to do. I do, however think that there can be some modifications to get more trades as well as keep us out of trouble. I had 9 trades on my test enviroment on the 15 mn (Kstd adjustments and green) and of the 5 losses all but one was a parobolic issue. The other I felt was my adjustment was off a fewtenths off or so. Therefore, I am hopeful I can get this moving in the right direction. thanks again endroute! The goal s/b 80 20 then we are all rich!.

try 1h instead it is the smallest in my opinion even that sometimes is small when u must cover the losses and the spread. best regards

--- 帖子 #277 ---
your right on the 1 hour. I like to test in the 15 o below because.Unless you get to the daily typically signals are just chatter. Endroute.. I am certain someone can program the psar in for you. I did nt write the original but its an easy indicator. I am not using the forums ea but if you post again someone,, I will put it in if no one else does. should take about 20 seconds. double PSAR1 = iSAR(NULL,0, 0.02, 0.2,1);

Any chance we could cajole the stoch indi out of you endroute...pretty please.

Hi, Did anyone have a valid trade in the past hours ? I had a good one on EG 30M charts this morning. I took only 17 pips because I was away from my PC. Good luck on the US session. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello Endroute. Thanks for the system. Do you trade this strategy on live trading(demo/real account)? This is because i see you have faith in it but while backtesting it with vhandstrade simulator, I found that the cog indicator repaints too much. I am skeptical about the cog indicator. Thanks and waiting for your reply. Wahnone

--- 帖子 #283 ---
wahnhoe read the thread it have been alot of talk about the repainting of this indicator. best regards

--- 帖子 #284 ---
no luck on my end with this system. Just a bunch of losses on the 15 . Actually, I would do better with all the signals going the other way!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
One bad week and everyone give up? Following endroute's pairs &amp; TFs, GU 1H was the winner of this week. The EAs didn't take the trade for me, but I hope some of you took it manually. Have a nice weekend, Dani M.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Well, I thought there would be more action and a higher hit rate. Everthing I took (but I didn't follow the yellows to the extreme) went the other way. I mean, just throwing a bunch of ma 's with parobolic isnt going to be enough. I was looking for the cog settings to filter seems like a crutch more than a filter. \

--- 帖子 #287 ---
That is why people fail...... no stamina...... a few losses and off to the wizard for a new system. oh yeah the other thing .. letting EAs trade for you.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Yes I gave up (on this system) I have plenty of other methods that have higher win rates. Johndoe trade this for a month or two and please share your results. You sound so keen. If this is working for Enroute and others then congratulations more power to you! Personally I am sicking with the methods that made me 140 pips this week not the one that lost me that much. Take what works for you and throw the rest away. I'm just insecure about an indicator that says one thing and then does another... Thats just me and I can't trade comfortably knowing that the COG is telling porky pies. So instead of laughing at the people jumping ship maybe you could shed some light on why we might be failing with this system if you think it's so great. Otherwise keep your negative wisdom to yourself and let us get on with learning new things (that work) !!!! Johndoe you obviously aren't a quitter so please go ahead trade this for 2 months and share your progress with this system But one thing I agree with you is on the EA's... I believe we already have EA's in the way everything is computerised for us. But for some this still isn't enough T hink about the old school traders who had to draw all their charts and moving averages etc by hand and maybe even place their trades by telegram lol. They must be looking down on us and laughing. Anyone who wants a computer to trade for them takes what they already have for granted IMO. Yes some people are busy and dont have time to sit at their computer to wait for trades etc etc. I have an idea... Forget about trading!!! Why don't I program my computer to write a new teeny bopper hit song for me and release it to the world... Or maybe my computer can draw me some nice art work and I can call myself an artist! Give me a break... EA's are so half assed it shits me to think theres people out there that are that lazy looking for such a free lunch... They say trading is an art not a science and I want to be an artist. x

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Cindy Can u give me a clue or something perhaps start a new thread with your sysrtem (systems ) that made u 140pips ? do what everyone else does on this forum share knowledge and learn from others (pls forgive my spelling im from sweden ) best regards

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Jdalfelth seeing as I have only been trading for 1 year I don't feel confident enough to start a thread of my own I won't do that ... maybe one day. But if you're keen to learn what I do PM me and maybe we can chat in the trading week. I do like sharing knowledge to deserving peple but I don't like the thougt of screaming it to the world in a thread. Sorry for getting off topic endroute. Don't get me wrong I think you have hit the nail on the head in your logic of selling the EMA cross high and buying it low I just don't like the COG personally. But I'm no expert myself

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Jdalfelth activate your PM on this forum!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Just want to add... It's a tough gig starting a new thread (I am guessing). You start it with the best intentions, you want to help people, you want to share a good thing, you want people to be successful. But if Joe blow reads your thread and loses money then you're Joe Blows worst enemy, you've wasted Joe Blows time and he wants to kill you!!! Chances are though that Joe Blow never paper traded it, never back tested, and doesn't know the first thing about price action, yet he expected to read your thread follow you simple rules and become a millionaire in less than a year. If Joe Blow actually made money with your system or method he might thank you but not with the same emotion or energy he showed or felt when he lost. So be greatful we live in this information age that is the internet and also be thankful for the thread starters on this forum. Wheather it worked for you or not THEY TRIED. Blah Blah this is not a get rich quick Biz nor did anyone except the system SELLERS tell you this. But it can be (if you let it) the answer to your financial freedom if you READ, LISTEN, LEARN, TEST, TRY, EVALUATE, LEARN AGAIN and repeat until you get it and find something that WORKS. Don't be a fool - Be greatful for this free pool of information and use it wisely and if you fail IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR NOT BEING BETTER INFORMED. Trade well

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Cindy It is done it is activated. Also start a new thread hmmmmm i dont know i think people here in general is good. And retards and idiots are everywhere many have typoed in a risk disclaimer for the people that know better. Also dont be so afraid of have some enymys it is also a sign of success i think the most rich and sucessfull people have alot of enemys that a jelaous of them and there success i have some enemys it is natural some people just dont go together. Best regards

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hey I'm not claiming to be rich or successful nor do I feel that people that don't know any better are idiots or "retards". I just think they may be desperate for a quick fix. Hey I've been there myself! I just don't think this forum needs athread by little old me. Theres enough good threads and information on here already and until I feel I can do better Mr C will just sit on thesidelines! The way I trade is basically from a mixture of everything I've learned on here anyway.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi endroute, Hope you are fine. You mentioned before that when price crosses the golden COG line, it is a good opportunity to wait for the price to cross back and get in. Now, do you use pending orders, or just set an alert and waits the candle crossing back to close before taking a trade ? BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hmmm.... whre is everybody??? did everybody read the first page???? endrote says "if you don't like the system don't trade it, if you have snide comments I don't want to hear them, if you want to contribute please do so. I would also expect that everyone be respectful of one another at least on this thread" by the way yesterday i made 170 pips with this system.... cheers.....

--- 帖子 #297 ---
prove it!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Cindy &amp; Lost Angles, I'm keeping an eye on the same charts as endroute said he trades. I had no signal in the last few days. So I tried to trade the price action once it crossed the golden line and moved back in, but I was wipesowed. I'm interested in seeing your trades lost angles as well. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
hi there cindyXXX.... actualy i dont have to prove anything..... what i'm gonna say is you put endroute system in your Metatrader and use the setting that endroure gave us.. and then whalaaa...... you shall see what i get on USD/CHF EUR/USD and GBP/USD yesterday..... did you see how pips is coming my way.... and one thing 4 sure you have to follow the rule or else you will get BURN.... i kinda like endroute basic idea of MA crossover, because i had use it for quiet a while. and i add MA cross over signal from trend follower system created by TheWIcker i edit the MA period to 5 and 13 and i also add RSI (14) hev a nais dey.....

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi Lost_Angles, I checked it again, and I saw your trades on UC and EU. I wouldn't have taken the GU, but the other two are valid successful trades. You are good. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
hi there dani, you are right on the GU trade, like i said before i kinda like endroute basic idea of MA crossover, because i had use it for quiet a while. so if the crossover signal popout i analize it with my other indi... which is RSI if the price go below level 50 mean it will go down. and the COG wave direction is going down. i forgot to mention i trade manualy i don't use EA....

--- 帖子 #302 ---
To all of you who don't like this system; please go to the system you like and let the rest of us concentrate on trading with Endroute's system. Endroute, thanks for your method. It's working for me. Regards

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Fair enough - But if it's working for you all I was saying was to post your trades and help those that might be struggling.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hey Lost Angels well done on the trades it's just a little hard to go back and look what you did because of the repainting of the COG - MAybe you or Endroute or anyone else trading this could post some live examples as they're happening and this thread could get back on topic Cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
believe you used the above for 1hr charts, How about for 4Hr charts, what are the optimum setting to use? anyone? also does different currency pairs have different optimum setting?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi, Same settings for 1H &amp; 4H. All pair use the same COG setup. Use the MA cross indicator for getting early alerts &amp; double check with the rules once you have a crossover. Have fun. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi, I did about 35 pips on the 4H charts from 1.0132. I was away from the pc so my TP was hit. If I were here, i would have let it go. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
endroute.... where the hell are you... we need enlightmen from you.....

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi guys, i am a newbie here but has started trading with endroute concept. And wallah.. I've found it suited to me. All the while I am reading in this thread and i think Cindy is looking for a Holy Grail system. Emm.. thru my 2 years involvement in FX, I have not found any so called a Holy Grail system. The problem of trading actually coming from our innerself. Cheers

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I found the Holy Grail - Buy a money printing press

--- 帖子 #311 ---
like ur strategy.... i think this one will give a short set up....

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hey folks, Forgive me if someone has already posted similar rules to the ones below. I read most of the thread and began back testing using the rules below. Time-frame: 1 Hour Entry Rules: Price and cross-over (5 &amp; 13 EMA) must take place below (buy) or above (sell) the green COG line. Stop-loss: 10% of the difference between the upper and lower orange COG lines (+ spread) above (sell) below (buy) the orange COG line. Exit Rules: exit at opposing orange COG line or when an opposite crossover occurs out with the green COG lines. Using this very strict entry, stop and exit rules the back-testing on 9 pairs returned no loosing trades and 2029 pips. However, as we all know this is not live forward testing which usually brings lesser results. Again though I feel there is certainly potential with this system. Unfortunately I have no time to day trade at the moment but would be interested to see if anyone else is willing to trade these rules live on a demo. Hope this helps in some way and please check back through the charts and you will see the straightforward entries. I quickly put together an excel sheet so please feel free to check all the entries. Good Luck Foggytrader

--- 帖子 #313 ---
i personally think more of an understanding of this cog indicator is needed.. like where exactly is the thinking behind the settings to this indicator.. thanks in advance mike

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Maybe this could help though I found it listed for another indicator (polynomial regression - edit: in fact doing some research seems that COG is a variation of the original named ANG-PR - maybe forum member Ronald Raygun could help you about this): It is very probable that the variables here have that same significance. Knowing that, you could take the mq4 version of the indicator and read the math behind involving them so to have a clearer picture.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Good for you! post your trades and results pfft no im not looking for a holy grail fool... was just sharing my thoughts King of Dinar? hope you didn't invest in that!!! Might as well go to a casino and put all your money on black.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Yes Endroute please come back - hope my negative posts didn't put you off I would like to apologise I meant no offence! I promise I will keep any negative opinions to myself in the future. I am watching this thread everyday because this method still interests me. By the way I found this indicator the other day which may be of some use its a multi time frame MA so you can look at the 5 min MA on a 1 hour chart etc. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
endroute , For your 1hr method, can you post some screen shot examples of the coming trades you made? Pls post a 'before' and 'after'. 'Before' refers you the point you decide to enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Cindy &amp; awsl, I PM him a couple of times with no reply. I really don't know whats up with him, and its a pity, because he has a lot of experience. So I think that we should do it ourselves by sticking to the original rules, and study from each other. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Sounds good Dan mir I'm sure endroute will be back

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Ahhh C'mon man, We should be sticking to each other. learning process will never end.. I agree with u cindy and Dan.. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Why should I post my result to you? The more important thing is for me. As long as I can make money. Fine with it. It's only my thought. I respect your view as u should respect mine. TQ

--- 帖子 #322 ---
OK I just meant maybe some screen shots of potential trades or whatever seems this thread is missing that. No disrespect intended!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
This is exactly the way it shouldn't be. If I were endroute, such a foolish things and newbie questions asking for the 10th time the settings of the COG, cause me to leave. So please behave, I'm serious. I would like to ask you to post charts with trades you took, and it will be nice if you can alert the forum about trades to be taken. I suggest to stay with 1H time frames and above, like endroute did. Comments anyone ? Dani M.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I agree Dan - On with the thread

--- 帖子 #325 ---
just wanna share something i learn from endroute : gj on TF 15 http://i32.tinypic.com/2zxnrjc.gif Ej on TF 15 http://i31.tinypic.com/o69zsn.gif i add EMA crossoversignal from trend follower created by The Wicker n add MACD traditional.... " HAVE FUN "

thanks , doblece i like to understand exactly what is going on, it helps to build it into the my own trading system!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi L.A. Thanks for sharing such a good trades. Keep sharing. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Its funny I thought everyone bailed on this approach, I am glad some stuck around and are maybe having some success. I must say I got a little irritated when this became an EA fest and people were trying this on the 5min charts and wondering why they were getting killed. However reading the thread again also made me realize that I could have been doing a better job teaching and leading the discussion, so if everyone would permit me I would like to take this thread in a different direction, I want to show you how to trade and trade well. The first thing we need to do is start with an easy system that if traded consistenly the same way can make some serious pips. The rules are though you have to trade the system, post charts and talk about your trades the good the bad and the ugly, and there are NO EAs, there are indis that will alert you to trades both via email and alerts. I will post daily and point out setups that are about to happen as well.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Sounds great Endroute welcome back Agree with you 100%. Also it's great you mentioned posting trades "the good THE BAD AND THE UGLY" because it keeps it real and also reminds readers of the thread that yes there are some losers and also brings to attention mistakes people might make. Good stuff Can't wait to learn from you

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Sounds great Endroute!! Cheers, Matt.

Hi. This is my SS for GJ 15 min, 30th June. I am using MT4 Demo for my chart and execute order thru my FXCM since that they offered a quite low spread in the market. I have a simple trading style and have good trade so far with COG, but with a little bit changes in entry. I am using EMA5 cross GAN Hilo instead of EMA13. And I am using EMA15 as well as my secondary cross to Gan Hilo. If both EMA cross Gan, means the trend is really strong.About the COG, Damn with the repainting. as long as I can see the chart right on time, who cares man.. coz I am an Intraday trader. And as long as I can see the PIPS even 20 pips I will grab but play smart with many lots. Just my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Welcome Back Endroute, Actually you have introduced such a good strategy with COG. I agreed to some opinions whereby they said that there's nothing special with COG. Well that's their opinions. This is my thought. There's nothing special in any INDI. What makes INDI so special in any occasion. It's you yourself. Coz when you begin to understand the need of having such INDI and start develop your own strategy, it will make your INDI become RELIABLE and POWERFUL for your trade. There's no point you have the most powerful INDI on the planet earth if you can't understand the concept or even look into it's beauty. And having good strategy is crucial when you implement your INDI. Please watch KUNGFU PANDA to learn something from there ladies and gentlmen. Forex Market is very cruel and we need to behave like a warrior. We kill or we got killed. I love the COG.. It suited well to my trading style with a little bid modification in technique. Anyway, thanks endroute for this.. Let make this thread such a beautiful and meaningful learning field. From me Kingofdinar (The newbie)

--- 帖子 #333 ---
could someone please explain what cog stands for,and which trading platforms have this indicator?Thank you.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
COG = Center of Gravity.mq4 For Metatrader4 Platforms. Place in folder: c&gt;programfiles&gt;yourmetatrader&gt;experts&gt;indicators.

Hi all, Thanks Endroute for creating this thread with really great trading system. FYI, I have tried your system about 7 trading days ago on my new demo account (just for this system). Up to yesterday, 13 trades were made &amp; only 1 lost trade (with -35pips only). Overall, already made total profit of 300 pips. (** forgot to capture the chart on the trading time, will do next time) This really works for me &amp; using the longer TF is better (1 Hr TF is the best).... Patience is the key for success.... Bravo endroute....

--- 帖子 #336 ---
how about this setup guys.....

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hi, endroute wolcome back.... i can't wait to read your next post... your system is one thing for sure, never trust your trade with an ea.... altough some of us made lots of pips from that...

Thank you all for the kind words.

I have taken so much from this and other forums, its time I give a little back. As I read back through this thread and realized almost everyone here is going through the same thing I went through when I first started, I was directionless, trying any new system that looked like it might make me the next George Soros. I was so focused on finding "the system" that I never stayed with one thing for very long, it was kind of like dating before I met my wife. I painted my screens with indicators, I tried lots of different timeframes, etc. I didn't make any money doing this, but I did learn a lot. At some point I had an epihany and actually started putting the things I had learned to work for me, I started being consistent, I gained more confidence, and I started trading without fear. The goal is to help you all get to where I am know. We will not be abondoning the COG or the MAs. In subsequent Posts I will go over: -picking your time frames and the trading with the trend, not your normal look at the daily chart and trade in that direction trend trading. Hint you can make money on all the timeframes. -Money management - it's not the same old 2% thing that get thrown around, this is money management and leverage for the real world. -Picking your entry points. And a couple of really good approaches (3 to be exact), with the COG/MA approach being 1 of them. A good trader always has a couple of well tested system in his/her back pocket. -Exits -Let the trading begin, with all 3 of these systems. The key is to trade the systems as they were designed, if you want to make changes to them great, but I don't want to hear about it at least on this thread. Our goal is to consistently trade systems we know work and not to keep adding new indis to keep us out of the bad trades, there will be bad trades where you will loose a few pips. Just a fact of life.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
You don't want a ton of signals, you just want good signals. It looks like what KingofDinar is doing is veryifying the trend using the stochastics, a great approach, and something I will cover in a lot of detail as I love stochastics, especially multitimeframe/period stochastics.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Thanks enroute. Cant wait to read and learn more from you. Thanks for your efforts im sure we are many that are happy for it best regards

add this to your chart... hope it help.....

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi friends. I'm glad the thread is back on track, and endroute's return is a major part of it. It could be nice if someone volunteers to put down a summary of the method + FAQ + setup for newbies in the thread, so each time we see a "reoccurring" question we can send them to read the manual. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Lets face it most of have started out on the lower timeframe charts thinking that we can make x pips per day and minimize our downside because we are really involved in our trades etc etc. If you had the same experiences I did you would win big and loose bigger and never really make those pips. Let me clue you in its the same reason you won't be successful in the bigger timeframes, it is not that you can't trade the smaller timeframes and be successful you can and people do it every day but you need to walk before you can run. There are 2 real keys in trading and they are patience and consistency. Getting these 2 things down is your secret to success, its not the system. Trading and golf are very similiar in that they both require you play against yourself, not your broker not anyone but you. Yes before everyone get all hot and bothered money management is important but not nearly as important as patience and consistency. So lets start with consistency. You have to have a documented system and trade the system religously, and I mean every day day in day out, if that means you have to write your system on post it notes and put them all around your monitor(s) DO IT and then read the notes before you place a trade. This means you can't spend time tweaking your system after you have a looser, this is why you demo trade to test your system and get comfortable with it. You also have to only trade what you see and what you know. Ignore the crap news feeds from your broker that xyz is happening, or what Joe Bob on some other thread thinks the euro is going to do, screw Joe Bob, its your money and your trade don't allow some clown to mess with your future. Now with that said stay out of trades around key news events like the NFP, and for god sakes don't trade the dam news right now. At some point I will show/tell you how to make pips around news events that is brain dead simple with almost no risk to your account. The other piece to success is patience. Let the trade come to you, again trade only what you see and know and not what you think is going to happen. If you miss a big run up, don't worry I can assure you there will be others. Successful trading is NOT about the number of entries you have but in the pips you walk away with. The same holds true for exits, trade your system. So for example you are using ma crosses as you system you enter at a cross in one direction and you exit the trade when the ma's cross in the opposite direction, don't jump out of the trade to early, there is usually a pretty good chance that trade is going to keep going and net you more pips.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
So what follows is purely my own opinion, if you don't agree follow your own money management practices, I will not hold that against you. So the 2% rule has its place If you are an undisciplined trader without a system and you don't trade consistenly and are without patience this is a great way to keep you alive for 50 trades, its the equivalent of being slowly bled to death. If you can't trade consistenly etc etc, you shouldn't be trading much real money - stick to the micro accounts if you are working on these skills. With that said you will NEVER learn consistency and patience demo trading, it is completely different than trading with real $s, Euros or Yen, so trade those miro accounts untill you can be consistenly profitable and then and ONLY then move up to a mini account etc. My general rule of thumb when it comes to money management is that you want to have enough capital to see you through 15 loosing trades in a row. Now that capital does not have to be in your account, and for me I don't put that money in my account. So that means if you have 30 pip stops and you are trading full lots that means you need to have another 4500 lying around somewhere to see you through the rough patch or be prepaired to start trading much smaller lot sizes. I prefer the latter approach, instead of throwing more money at the problem I would rather work through my issues and build back up. I trade a mini account, I keep a max of 5K in the account and bank everything over that and sometimes I will take the account down to a few hundred bucks, and basically start from scratch. This keeps me honest and helps me keep my ego in check, and it usually only takes me a week to 2 weeks to build back up, so it is not a real hit to the income. So how do I trade. When I have my account at 5K I typically trade 1 lot at a time and have anywhere from 3-7 trades open at any given time, I monitor 18 pairs and only take the choicest of setups. I also fully exploit the leverage and use 200% leverage - why tie up more money than you have to. When I take my account down to a few hundred bucks, i will trade 1/10 of a lot and be in 2-4 trades untill i get to a couple of K, at which time I will move to half lots and maybe some full lots untill I get back up to where I want t be. So why do I only trade full lots and not double up you ask, it is because I know myself too well and don't trade as well when I double and triple up lots. Again this is what works for me. I want everyone reading this to make up their own minds as to how you manage your account, but please don't blindly go around following these rules just because someone says you should. Opinions, even mine, are like a__holes and everyone has them, but what matters most is what you think and what you are comfortable with.

Finding a consistent, well documented trading system is a grail in itself.- ---if that is the case you would automate because anything that you can dream up and review can be automated. I think that you should be able to do that with a system and have zero intuition in pulling the trigger. Therefore, I ask...Is anyone making money with what we have now that you have given us ? If not, its not a perfect system, which means its 50-50 trade and those folks that don't have the eye for this business are gonna get killed over the long term. --- if the system is not above average its just gonna eat your capital like a gas guzzling suv. I am not saying this system works or doesn't work. I just don't trade it -- not negatively, I just have not heard anyone say this is working out great for them

--- 帖子 #365 ---
The fact that people come here and just expect things to be dropped in their lap just astounds me. Evidently it is true that the people of world are becomming lazy sheep just like my fellow Americans. No system is perfect, and to even think there is such a thing is foolish. This is another great reason why people fail at this, they want systems dropped in their laps and don't want to have to do any work, or they want someone to write them and EA and then they wonder why it looses all the time. A good part of any system is the trader, there are nuances to every system that requires the best/and yes the worst computer ever invented and that is the human mind. This is the wrong thread for finding systems that are well documented and will work for everyone or for EAs that are the next big thing untill the next other big thing. I can teach people what works for me and why it works for me and I am willing to help individuals develop solutions that work for them. I have never claimed to offer anything but that, and does this require people put in some sweat equity hell yes it does nothing in life is free.

Thanks, Lost Angles this is very helpful

--- 帖子 #369 ---
We have a signal on Uch 1H charts Dani M.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Yes, that's right. You wait the candle close to enter? or have you already entered??

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I'm in since the candle closed. it was a valid signal IMO. Hopefully the price breaks 1.023 and will fly up. BTW, my trade on AU 4H mentioned above is still open. BR, Dani M.

Dear Thread, Happy to contribute to the well-being of the thread if someone can provide me a COG indicator for eSignal. Thanks, Lenoxer

COG stands for Centre of Gravity. The indicator has been supplied by Endroute on the first page

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Just entered BUY on USDCHF 1H TF and AUDUSD 4H TF.

Good work Endroute give us more best regards

Thanks for starting to post again endroute. I was begining to think that we had lost you. I look forward to your input. I've been lurking on this thread since you started it and I have to say that I've found the COG very useful. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #378 ---

Hi, I'm new to the forum and I only registered because of this thread! I could post my comment this morning but my approvel needs several hours. Then I got this beautiful message tonight "Forex Factory is undergoing scheduled server upgrades and will be unavailable for about 1 hour. Thank you for your patience." and again I can't update the thread I really like this system! Good work endroute! I want to share something about COG as you can see in the title. I downloaded the indicator and build an ea that sends a message to get all the good trades. But as many before there are some problems with COG repainting. Good for me, somebody posted the source code. I'm a softwaredeveloper, it wasn't that hard to understand the code. To avoid all the repainting probs just set the parameter i to the correct value. i is nothing else then the shift value in the MA's or e.g. the Bollinger Bands. To help you all to get a better understanding about that I build an indicator above the COG. I call it "COG NR" (NR stands for "no repaint") it shows you the values COG has had in the past so you can easily backtest and reproduce why you did the trade. Just copy the original COG and my modificated one to your indicators path, now restart and add them to your chart. TY scratch

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hmmm if i get itright acording to your indicator there have not been on right signal in GBP/USD or EUR/USD 1 hour chart for as long back the indicator goes hmmmm is something whrong ? best regards

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Good work on solving the repainting/backtesting issues. Am sure other posters to this thread will appreciate your efforts. I attach a chart showing a real money entry I took on 12 June long CADJPY per the rules of this system. Netted me 117 pips but as you can see the actual COG (solid lines) now indicates this ema cross would have taken place near the channel centre, whereas the modified COG shows how it lined up on 12/06/2008. Obviously this trade would have been filtered out of any backtests just using the COG on its own and therefore skew the results. cheers Crom chart: http://www.b3tards.com/u/910a7f16cb1...e17/cadjpy.gif

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks for the chart and the explanations Croms. IMO, by using the original COG, screen captures of the trades should be best taken on the time when the trades were taken (for further study), since the COG repaints. Thanks for Scratch for bringing the COG NR, so that we can make comparison on the past trades which have been taken. I'll try to attach to my chart to see how it goes.... Big Thanks For Endroute, for the best setting using COG and 5EMA-13EMA. It really worked for me when patience is with me.... but when I was not patient, I lost.... At least, I knew that I did not follow the setups. Good Job Endroute.... Please stay with us here....

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Nice work scratch now I can see this method works... The few trades I tested in real time lost and I blamed the repainting of the COG for giving me false signals but now I can see that yes there is real potential in this method. Cheers Also the few I tested live were on the 5 and 15 min charts ! Backtesting is important I wonder if there is any way now we can program the COG to go back more days Thanks Again

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Just got a signal on GU lets see what eventuates.... It is NFP day though 4 hours later...... 20 pip SL taken out (Chart #2)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Heres another entry was 1 hour and a bit ago seems to be going well... Time will tell... ...2 hours later 20 PIP SL hit (Chart #2)

--- 帖子 #386 ---
One more for the road... UJ entry was a couple of hours ago

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Can you please post the results when the trades finished? TY My chart (1hour) shows an buy entry for EUR/USD! Watch the red circle. The dashed green line is above the EMA cross here.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Results posted above EC -20 GU -20 still waiting for UJ to finish but not looking great. Like I said before it is NFP day and the market (smart money) is probebly waiting for the news.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi, Don't you look for clearer signals ? I take trades only when the crossover itself occurs above/below the green line. I want to as sure as possible the price is trending, not ranging with a spike who crossed the green line. I can't say it is an "insurance company" because I failed with NU 4H yesterday, but it make me feel better with the entry. BR Dani M. BTW, thanks scratch for the indicator.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thats exactly the point in the chart I posted above (sorry the chart isn't best quality). For backtesting you cannot use COG because COG gives you only the now. COG NR instead shows you the old values of COG. See the dashed lines and you can see that ema cross in the red circle is below the lower green line (= buy for me). Correct me if I am wrong. FYI: I will rewrite COG NR that it is an independent indicator because I realized some perfomance problems on backtesting. I will then upload the compiled and the source file for everyone. TY scratch

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi scratch, I'm sorry. You're right, I didn't see the green dashed line behind the circle. Good entry IMO. Dani M.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi scratch, With the modification of COG , are you saying that we have to change the value of the setting? or we just stay on with endroute's setting? Still Blurrr... Anyway for me myself, I have no problem with the repainting since that I am using it right on time. If I miss, then I will chase for another opportunity. Thanks KOD

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hey Dinar I'm pretty sure he means use the same settings - its just with the modified COG you can see the exact position of it in the past -hence "No repaint". For live trading yes your right the normal COG works fine. if you look at them both in real time they are of course in the same position as each other.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
One thing that bothers me is that we where given instructions by Endroute basicaly not talking about our trading or indicators and things IN HIS THREAD and that he was willing to teash us some if we just listened and posted our trades the way he wanted. The first thing we do i s change hes main indicator the cog and start talkin about it and compare it. I hope im whrong and that Endroute dont have been afended by this but he was not here yesterday...... So Endroute pls forgive me if i have ofended you and pls forgive the others too. Best regards jgadefelth

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks Cindy... KOD

--- 帖子 #396 ---
if you trade MAs and you are good at it then the best result you can get is break even in the long run. it does look good in hindsight, yes. be careful.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Thats it! I couldn't explain it better.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I see what you're saying J but nothing has been changed the COG is still exactly the same. Weather you ue the modified version or the normal version in real time it doesn't matter they are the same... The only difference is the modified COG we can backtest.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Scratch nice work this is cool. There may be some more optimum settings that can be applied to the cog. As for me no trades this week I am on vacation, and most of all no trades on nfp days, no system can keep you from killing yourself on these days.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Endroute pls give us some more mutch mutch more info to read in the week end. best regards

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Finally I got it! It took me some hours but here is the COG indicator I promised. It has no repainting and it is not limited in bars . I have uploaded source and the compiled one. Please try and report errors to me (pm please!) I'm going to update this thread with some valid signals and the results in future. I hope that's ok for you endroute? So, lets try to make some PS: COG NR is useless now ...

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Thanks scratch now i got something to play around with. While i ll wait for Endroute to teach us more best regards

--- 帖子 #403 ---
i usually don't like to bloat a thread with useless comments, but i wanted scratch to know his efforts are very much appreciated. i love ma cross systems and this one is very good. nice gains and small loses..what else could anybody want.........thanks again...............vince-ac

--- 帖子 #404 ---
What do you mean?? Maybe endroute can tell us. Do the candle have to close below the green line right on the ema cross? For this chart its easy to say because we can already see the future ... but in real trading ... would you take this one??

--- 帖子 #405 ---
For me it's a valid signal. The candle that closed below the green line was the long red one, on june 25 at 16:00. So it is not "right on the ema cross" but previous to the cross that occurs two candles later. Thus the signal (the cross) comes after the close below and validates.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Strictly speaking it is a valid trade as there was a previous close beneath the green line.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Brilliant thanks Scratch this is awesome

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hello All, I became not patient &amp; enter trade short, even though candle not closed yet.... But the candle looked like it's going to close above the gold line... And the stoch seems already overbought.... Hope my trade will be great....

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hey Atuque The EMA's haven't crossed yet... AS far as I understand this isn't a valid trade yet for Enroutes system?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Check out the EUR-CHF 1hour chart -looks like it could be setting up for a good one

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Also EUR/USD seems to produce a valid signal in a few minutes, just wait for the ema cross!

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Interesting on that one the EMA's are already signaling short! I wonder how Enroute would play that ?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Ahhh, stupid, I just watched the cross not the signal ... yes you are right cindy ... I think the signal is only valid if ema crosses twice ... that means it must signal buy (sure you don't buy because cog says no) then it must signal sell and the last bar must close above the green line ... then it should be valid ... this is the rule!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Oh k that makes sense cheers

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Remember that endroute advised to close positions if ema changed signal, so you would close and reopen later ... I like this because you can secure some pips and did not run in danger that a good trade turns against you.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Yup, it's not a valid signal yet... Only that I saw that the price consolidated above the green line, &amp; the stoch showed overbought.... Don't follow my way.... I think I am so impatient...

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Scratch! What is for an indicator below the chart? Can you build a dashboard indicator like this one for the MA? This indicator would show the position of the course in relation to the green line for each currency pair and each timeframe. A green arrow would indicate that the price is below the green line. A red arrow would indicate that the price is over the green line. My message is the same for 4X Weezal, Waltini, Endfront, theherryfarm, endroute and anyone who has knowledge in programming. Thank for your help! I don't know the programming language.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hello All, After closed my trade yesterday at break-even on EJ, seems that I missed the change to gain from yesterday's trade (should gain +14pips if I still stayed). Anyway, just now saw the sell signal on EJ.... I go Short... Trade At Your Own Risk.... -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Another sell signal for GBP/USD.... T.A.Y.O.R....

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks Atuque please post the results if you can cheers

The Trades Updates: EJ still going down (+60 pips and keep going) &amp; GU as well (+20 pips and keep going). Another trade I have taken &amp; forgot to post.... My GJ already hit TP (+50 pips) p/s: BIG THUMBS-UP FOR ENDROUTE FOR THE SYSTEM....

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Hey balouf, this has nothing to do with this thread, please stop such postings. Please write PMs or cantoact me via IM in future if you need personal help. Thank you atuque1. I'm constantly watching at EUR/USD 1H and did not get a valid signal yet.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I am glad you got some good pips with this trade. However I didn't see a valid signal according to Endroute's system from your chart. I see the cross of the EMA's 4 candles prior to your sell entry, but there was no close of any candle either before or after the EMA cross above the upper green line as required by Endroute's system.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
The EUR/JPY trade seems good for me ... personally I think its not necessary that ema cross is right on the closing candle. GBP/USD, hmm I would not trade this one but it seemed to be successful. I think the closing bar was to far away from the cross. GBP/JPY, with real money I wouldn't take this one. But in fact this was an successful trade too. The close is near but didn't cross the COG line to validate.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Both EJ &amp; GU closed with profit today.... only that EJ hit TS (trailing stop) with bigger pips (+69pips), but the GU only got +3 pips after it bounced back up... (luckily I set the TS at 25pips)... Better get small pips than get some losses...

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Actually, a valid signal was there when I took the trade on EJ. The closed 'sell' candle was above green line, Then I waited for the EMA crossed (the 2nd signal &amp; the important one)... Then I set TS at 25 pips, because I need to send my car for repair.. huhuhu... When back at my monitor, happy to see the green....

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hello, Today i took 2 trades on eur/usd 5 min tf. used 20 pip stop ant 30 pip tp.The first one went perfectly ant with the second one i had little worry but both of them were succesfull. This was my first trades and i am +60 minus spread.Will see next daay. Thank you for the great system and wish you many pips!

Congrats Jangie.... It's not easy to scalp, I've tried before.... not working for me... Good Luck Jangie..

I saw Signal for Sell on EJ 1Hr TF. Thought to enter when EMA cross, but too sleepy (12midnight here) ,.... So, Enter Short / Sell with 70pips TP &amp; 25pips TS (SL set to 50pips)... Don't follow me, since the EMA not crossed yet, a bit risky.... Trade At Your Own Risk.....

--- 帖子 #430 ---
No offence atuque but if your taking trades that aren't to the rules of Endroutes method then what are you doing posting them in his thread. Thanks for sharing but if your going to take alternative trades then maybe you could start a new thread for that. Hope this doesn't sound harsh just calling it how I see it Good trading

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Sorry Cindy, actually only this time I didn't wait for real setup... Regret my move there.... I should just went to sleep last night without trade. Till now, the pips still -ve pips..... Thanks Cindy, I will remember this moment.... Must Wait For The EMA Crosses....

hello friends, it seems usd/cad the trade will be soon am i right?

Hi guys, I've been following this thread I personally I feel that this is a wonderful strategy. Easy to follow and good on filtering out bad trades. Anywayz, anyone keeping an eye on USD/CHF on the daily chart? Seems to me that we potentially have a good criteria to enter a long trade when the 2MA crosses which would probably be quite soon. What do you guys think? Max

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hey Max The MA's have already crossed up on my chart at yesterdays close... Looks like a good one. (First Chart) I don't have the capital or patience to trade the daily charts myself. USD -JPY on the 1 hour chart looks like its about to cross (Second Chart) and GBP-JPY could be setting up too

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Yep just gotta wait for the MA's to cross up won't necesarily be soon!

--- 帖子 #436 ---
No worries atuque keep posting

--- 帖子 #437 ---
An EMA cross outside the gold line... (on the Loonie, on July 4: see red arrow). It only would have been good for about 30 pips, but if I saw/see such a set up I'd feel safe adding more value to my pips than usual. agree? This thread could use more chart postings imho... http://picnac.com/images/8817cog_ema...old%20line.gif

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Negative. Since the COG is constantly redrawing itself, the only time a screenshot is worth posting on this forum, is when you enter the trade, because hours or days later, the COG lines will be significantly different. This is not to discredit this trading system by any means, but showing where you entered a trade earlier in the day means nothing, because the COG redraws, the graph needs to show current information.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
hi logiktrader, ah yes, judging on the history of this thread I definitely should have been more clear on what I was using, lol. The indicator I am using is the non-repainting version that was recently created and posted in the past page or two of this thread.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi piperomia I'd have to disagree with you there about adding more to the trade.. Technically the trade would of been BE at best if you were strictly following the rules of this system because the price never hit the bottom green line (one exit) and when the EMA's crossed back up (other exit) the trade would have been in negative pips. But like you said there were 30 pips in it so I think a wise trader would of locked in profits or moved the stop to BE at some point. It's easy to say in hindsight "oh yea there were 30 pips in that trade" but if you were in it live how would you know 30 pips is all it would go? Thats why having defined targets or exits is prob the most important thing to have in any system IMO. It's easy enough to get into a good trade but much much harder to know when to get out. Thanks for sharing keep them coming! Agree with you we need more trades posted. The good the bad and the Ugly!!! Cheers

--- 帖子 #441 ---
guys...nervous and with this one....hope it follow the 30mins....

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hi, get out on the next ema cross in the opposite direction! So piperomia should get some pips ... Watch the chart!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
oh sorry I was just looking at the chart he posted and it looked otherwise! Anyway EUR-CHF just signaled a long...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
EC going well after shakey start (5 pips off stop loss) will post results when it finishes.... Come on guys post some set ups or trades it's getting very cold in here lol By the way Scatch on my charts the UC trade would have been in negative PIPS after the EMA crossed back up check it out Are you going by the close of the candle?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hey Endroute if you're reading this this thread doesn't want to hear me ranting on about about my trades and opinions .... WE WANT YOU! As soon as you stop posting people seem to lose interest in this thread. I and I'm sure many others would love to hear from you if you're still interested in running this thread. Anyway thanks for the system, please stay with us Cheers

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Oh, the EUR CHF is a nice one! Please remember to post the results! UC ... hmm I can't see it live ... the chart posted by piperomia has a longer bull candle then yours. Has anyone really traded this one? Maybe he or she can tell us @ steven_leo ... if your ema 5 crosses the ema 13 it is valid. Trust the system, follow the rules and manage your risk. Then it can be a good trade. (Trade at your own risk!)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hello, This time I follow Endroute.... On GBP/CHF, signal for buying... EMA crossed up. I just set TS 30 pips... no SL set (because previous experience, touched SL before follow the trend again)... T.A.Y.O.R...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
The cross on today 14:00 isn't valid!! There is no candle that closes below the lower green line. I would be trading this one!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi scratch, I thought I read the setup correctly, that the close of candle below the lower green line.. or at least near the green line? Maybe my mistake again??

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Try to work on your patience ... you will get valid signals day by day! But, please post your results!

Hi guys I am new to this forum, but i really like this system, so I am doing some paper trading to see how well will it perform. I think that we have a nice set up on the EUR/USD pair, according to endroutes rules. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I dunno mate - IMO this would be buying pretty damb high! the MA's crossed but the candle it crossed on was well above the middle line. I would be nervous taking this trade myself but you never know. Anyone else have any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hey mate I dunno what the drama is. You have your rules for entry and they are black and white. It either IS or ISN'T a trade. If it is then take it if it isn't then just wait for the next bus What is so hard about that? No need to learn patience just DO IT! Plan your trade and trade your plan. As a great trader once said "most of the money is made sitting and waiting" hence: by not losing you are essentially winning! Think about it! Good trading mate

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Hee guys. I have been using this for a number of months and am always in to learn more about something. Will go over it from the very start later today and share if I have anything to add. Greetings from Puerto Vallarta

--- 帖子 #457 ---
As traders we need to populate our trading tool bags with knowledge and tools. You can never stop learning, you need to keep an open mind and always be willing to listen to what others have to say and are doing, you never know you might pick up something truely worth while. So with that said everyone puts so much focus on the entry and then everyone forgets about the exits. Let me tell you exits are more important than the entries. Some good exits on the 1 hour charts. 1. Candle Stick Patterns - Don't laugh they work really well. See the attached candle sticks document. 2. Stochastic - a great tool to use on the 1 hour chart is a 4hr 10.3.3 stochastic, when it starts to turn in the opposite direction exit the trade, the downside with this is it requires lots of Patience, for those of us without patience you can use the 1 hr 14.3.3 of whatever stoch setting you choose. 3. MA Cross - for me I still like the 5/13 - yes you give back some pips but I think you make more over time than you give back, but you can also use a quick set like the 5/8 or something similiar.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I have visited this thread and read about this system many times. This is my first post on this thread. It has been over 4 year since I start trading forex. One thing I realize is that without patience, you can just quit the forex game because it is not going to work for you. I am live trading and I have trades that stay there for 3 weeks or more. Most people would want to either cut their losses and get out or quickly take a few pips and move on. We learn that this is not the way to really make money in forex. If you trade like that your losses will always be more than your wins. PATIENCE, and more PATIENCE. At least this is mwhat works for me. Right now I am trading with almost no loss (YES I MEAN THAT) No loss. How I do it? Patience my Friend.

Hello All, This morning, saw this long signal on GU 1 Hr TF. EMA crossed and going up. Just entered Long.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Closed this one with 12 pips.... coz need to go out and there was news one hour later.....

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thanks Freddy that would be great Welcome to the thread!

--- 帖子 #463 ---
guys....waiting this one....

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Yes, this is a good one! Please post results! Waiting for the next cross And for your past gains!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
The setup should be a good one, but hit my SL at -40pips (I have to set SL because need to leave the monitor a few hours...) Maybe the MA's a bit too flat to enter long just now?? Or maybe should not go long when the COG trending down?? Need more input, more input...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Past Is Past. Anyway, another good setup on AUD/USD 1 Hr TF. Anybody on this? I go Long (set SL at 20 pips &amp; with TS 25 pips).

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Nice one atuque - you're right past is past. Just cusrious as to why you used a 40 pip stop on GU I think endroute said he uses 20 on everything but GJ and uses a 50 pip SL on that. Could have halved your loss there. Anyway interesting point you made about the slope of the EMAs and trend of the COG but of course not every trade will be a winner. Let us know how AU goes

--- 帖子 #468 ---
So Far, So Good.... Just curious about the Stoch, reaching overbought... maybe need to close soon... or just let it go..??

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Keep it simple and just exit on a cross back of the EMA's or if it touches the top band. Maybe move your SL to BE. This is how i would do it. But i's your trade hey

After 26 long hours my EC trade has been stopped out at BE (trade I posted yesterday). At one stage it was up about 40 pips but couldn't get any sort of upward momentum going. I guess if I were trading this with real money I would of closed it at some point maybe with a small profit as the price action was messy and alot of the time sideways and 26 hgours is just too long for me to sit in a trade for a 1 hour TF personally. Anyway maybe next week will produce some better results.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
As for myself, I always set TS at least 25 pips (because a lot of the good setup will rebounce less then 20 pips).

--- 帖子 #472 ---
The AU Trade, closed at TS with green pips.... +73 pips. This setup is good... I learnt a lot form this. Patience is very most important.... Enough trades for me, for this week....

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Nice one Atuque ! I think you just learnt a very valuable lesson. Yes its a funny thing how emotions can tempt us iinto making rash decisions. Like for example you let that GU trade hit your 40 pip SL in the HOPE that it would turn back around But in that AU trade you just took, I remember you feeling the need to close it at positive pips prob out of FEAR it would turn against you. I think as traders we need to do exactly the opposite by cutting losses short and letting profits run. Sure lock them in along the way if you feel the need but at least give yourself a fighting chance of achieving the goal you set when you first opened the trade. I am still learning this myself I get very tempted to close a trade early because I fear it turning on me and ending up with nothing. But when it has truely turned on me I leave it open in the HOPE it will go back my way. If you think about it it's a very destructive mind set for tradiing. That's why I love these Black and white systems where the r:r ratio is good and all I have to do is let the trade play itself out knowing I have a defined exit plan. Good trading

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Yes CindyXXX, I was so frustrated when I saw the GU trade touched my SL (just touched about 1 pips from my SL). After that, the price gone up to about +180pips which I did not manage to get it (because I had trade long on AU, &amp; then I went out for dinner). Anyway, I was not that frustrated because my AU trade going on my way as well. Those who manage to go long GU was so lucky on the green pips.... Don't forget to put TS....

--- 帖子 #475 ---
my patience pays out.....

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I got an entry late on friday on EUR/JPY. I adjusted s/l to the blue cog line after it gets broken clearly. The next bar dropped me out with +13 pips.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi All, Look's like a good system, I can't wait to try it out next week. Which COG is everyone using, or which one does Endroute suggest, the one in the first post or the new JBCOG? Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
If you want to backtest use JBCOG, if you dont need to backtest anything you can choose yourself because for the now they show the same results.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks Scratch. What is your experience trading this system? I was lucky enough to catch a long singnal on the GBP/US on Fri morning and rode it for 104 PIPS, but Fri was easy, all you had to do was go against the USD.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I personally think this system has many potentials! It also fits very good to my trading style. Not to fast, not to slow tf's. Easy to use and understand. But that is my opinion, you must make yourself a picture if you like to use it or not. Remember this system needs a lot of patience! You can see some results posted by others.

Hey Vincent can you please speak english cause I know you can!!

what does "pik" stand for bro??

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hello All, I've been trying to post my trade so many time today (connection problem).... At last, I manage to get thru.... At 09:50, I entered short on EUR/AUD (biggest spread on this pair, 10 pips). Waited for the best setup on 1 Hr TF.. Now, on the green about +23 pips....

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Nice one atuque - I see it's up about 60 pips now!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Yes... I was late on that trade, because of internet connection problems... For those who enter from the EMA-cross, already gain 60 pips by now... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Did anyone else take that long signal on the GBP/US at 14:00 GMT? +25 pips now!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Yup I took it

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Not I!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I'm out at +30. It's having a hard time breaking the resistance at 1.9899, plus I don't like to be in a trade at the opening of the US Stock Market. I'll wait for the next set up.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I took the trade on EUR/CHF some minutes ago. OpenPrice: 1.6194

--- 帖子 #494 ---
My trade on EUR/AUD hits the TS with +28 Pips.... Not much, but I'm still happy with the green pips.... rather than lose... Isn't it?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I took as well, but a bit later... At open price: 1.6185.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
pik stand for "Pantai Indah Kapuk" are you indonesian?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
My trade get stopped out with +5 pips ... not a good decision to choose such close stops but, better then lossing

--- 帖子 #498 ---
yes i am indonesian.... but i am not from that place.........i live in medan.....

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Mine was closed with +18pips.... I only set the TS 15pips... But manually closed last night b4 I went to sleep (when I saw a minor retracement)... But I am happy with the pips.... Now, looking for a new setup....

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Anybody have this modified indy? (to use 4hr stoch on 1hr chart) Thanks

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Can you say which, please?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hello All, Seems that everybody is so quiet.... Anyway, no good setup yet so far....

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Still here antuque... I guess everyone is in the same boat as me and wondering where Endroute is and hoping he will come back to his thread. It would be great to have some input from the master himself!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Catched one yesterday night GBP/USD (chart 1). But right after the entry I got an exitsignal, -37 pips. Got another one this morning EUR/CHF (chart 2). Results later ...

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hello guys.... I saw good setup on EUR/CHF 1Hr, EMA Crossed above gold line, candle closed between green &amp; gold, &amp; stoch is going towards oversold... I go SHORT, entry price at 1.6051 .... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Another setup on GU 1Hr, EMA Crossed at green line, candle closed nearby green, &amp; stoch is going towards overbought... I go LONG, entry price at 2.0061.... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I got the same signals. My open on GBP/USD was 2.0058 ... For EUR/CHF i got 1.6055

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Nice trades antuque and scratch they seem to be going swimmingly you really seem to have a good grip on this system. Are you demo trading it or trading live?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I am trading demo only at the moment. But I really like the system and I think I will start trading this system with a small amount of real money and low leverage to test it under real market conditions.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
GU gone up to +34pips, then gone back down &amp; hit my TS with only +10pips... It's ok, I'm happy with 10pips gain.... Waiting for better setup on GU...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Yeah there was red news at 8:30 GMT for the pound - Can't see the results cause the calander is apparently down but that's prob what caused the reversal

--- 帖子 #513 ---
My Entry at 1.6051 was closed at BE (when retraced back). Then Enter Short again at 1.6044 with TS set at 15pips..... Just hit the TS with profit +24 pips... p/s: All my trades are on real money (but only micro account, leverage 1:200)

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I did not use TS and got knocked out with -32 pips on GBP/USD EUR/CHF hit SL -30 pips No luck that time ...

--- 帖子 #515 ---
this one may form a setup later i think.....

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Very precise... I compare with ADX and all the entries coincides but too much precise.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I looks like gonna cross at the blue line... so, IMO not good for going long (buy)... I think more likely to go down south, due to the COG is heading down.... I will only wait for the EMA cross downward at top green line, &amp; will go Short... Just wait and see....

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Ermmm... looks like you are right, because I never compare with other Indy... Only COG, EMA 5 13 (both are from Endroute ), &amp; I added Stoch (14,3,3) to see retracement sign. I think I will just use these, not to make it to complicated... Thanks....

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hello all, I am looking at GU 1 Hr &amp; 30 Mins. Waiting for the candle-close above green &amp; EMA cross. Looking for the Sell Signal.... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Just some info you might already know about the stochastic but I'm bored so I'm gonna write it anyway for people who don't. From what I've been taught and witnessed myself it's not enough to say that when the stoch is above 80 it's "overbought" or below 20 its "oversold" because most of the time when the market is trending it will stay above/below these levels and keep trending: below 20 = trending down... Above 80 = trending up. You can only really use it as a reversal sign or signal when it cosses back down from above 80 to below 80 = short. Or crosses back up from below 20 to above 20 = long Look back over your charts and see this for yourselves it's a very common occurance. Truth is no one really knows what's overbought or oversold but you can get a good idea of when it's about to turn around! Just trying to keep this thread educational lol I think someone requested the Multi time frame Stocastic indicator earlier in the thread. So here it is. It's handy if you want to see for example the 4hr stoch (change timeframe to 240 minutes (4h hours!)) on the 1 hour chart Thanks for everyone who is keeping this thread alive and posting their trades steven leo, antuque, and scratch spring to mind! Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
hey... Endroute... where the hell are you... we need enlightment here...... ( i alredy said that twice in this thread ) haha...... anyway this system is "May Green Pips Be With All Of Us"

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I hope he is not unhappy with our way here.... Endroute, please come back for better setup explanations online...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
In EU &amp; GU, I already entered trades. (Because found out EMA crossed down in 15Mins TF) &amp; I have to go out for a while... Candle already at selling trend... Both Enter Short, EU sell at 1.5840 &amp; GU sell at 1.9990 Trade at your own risk...

--- 帖子 #524 ---
And thanks to you too Cindy - I've only recently 'discovered' this thread, and am working my way through it...especially to see how others interpret and use Endroute's original system. One thing I have noticed is that my (FXDD) charts look very different to some of the charts posted, especially with regards to the 'position' of the COG lines with respect to price. (I am using the original settings, and yet to come across the 'modified' settings referred to in an earlier post) Keep posting those charts guys, especially those of up and coming trades!! freddi

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hit my SL with 1 pips only.... ..lookslike it will cross down....

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hey Freddi We are still using the same settings for the COG the reason it may look different on outr charts is prob because we are using the "no repaint" COG that Scratch made for us. It still gives the same signals in real time as the normal COG the only difference is it shows where the COG position was in the past hence "no repaint" and we can therefore back test with it. That's why the COG on our charts look very "squigly" compared to the normal "smooth" version. As I said they can both be traded in real time and will produce the same results. But if you have MT4 charts and want to back test with Scratchs' version then the indicator is posted by him in one of the previous posts... Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Thanks..found &amp; installed the JB-COG. Freddi

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Entered short on EUR/USD (1.5830) and EUR/GBP (0.7910). Someone else got this two trades?

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hey Scratch, I have sold EU @1.5828 (do you trade without a SL and monitor your trades?) I also have sold EG @ 0.7931 as of COP last night. Still learning this system..do you TP @ the next EMA cross? Thanks Freddi

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Becareful enter trade... don't be careless like me... Actually I have entered short EUR/USD (accidentally) &amp; GBP/USD about few hours ago, because both already overbought... &amp; I have something to do away from monitor. Luckily I did not put SL at 50 pips because after I entered, both pairs gone up more than 50 pips before coming back down. I accidentally entered short EUR/USD @ 1.5840 &amp; entered short GBP/USD @ 1.9990..... And both trades, I always put the TS (trail stop) with 25 pips.... (my way) **the EUR/USD short should be for the GU, but accidentally entered for EU.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Seems like news are giving deep impact on the prices and the trends today.... So scary....

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Why you entered GBP/USD? I could not see a candle closing above the green line The EUR/USD is a valid one for me.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Yes freddi, I'm closing at the next ema cross or at TS when i reached BE.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Today I am a real mess!! Shouldn't take both trades... A lot of US News tonite... Should just watch tv tonite...

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I can't create any strong exit rules. Help me please! For example, how do you use stoch for exit? Or you just use next MAs cross? (I've read author's post with 3 variants to exit but I still can't include them into 1 exit idea) Thank you!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi Aktaurus, As for my understanding, the author (Endroute) are using the EMA crossed for the exit. Actually it depends on the personality, whether you just want to have more profit or at the least profit... Some cases, the price goes into the price that I want until 50 pips and then rebounced back to BE, and then stay for long time (lost on the swap). So, now I always set TS (trailing stop) at 20 or 25 pips because I cannot constantly monitor my trades.... At least, I have some profits to be banked in.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
BTW, about my trades on GU &amp; EU yesterday.... So surprised that I'm still on that trades (even after twice the prices gone up more than 50 pips), I had to set SL at 80 pips for both yesterday (and prayed) &amp; set the TS at 25 pips.... This morning, I woke up &amp; see that the prices are back to the price which I entered the trade &amp; coming down ... more on bearish ..... Last night, I really cannot sleep thinking of the trades would touch my SL....

--- 帖子 #538 ---
After long wait on GU, at last the price hit my TS (@ 1.9983) &amp; gain only +7 pips... it's okey since it is green...

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Since I see GU still in bearish trend &amp; EMA crossed down (in 5Mins TF), I entered short/sell @ price 1.9961... &amp; put TP 50 pips including spread... (At Your Own Risk)

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hey aktarus I simply exit when EMA cross back or price touches the opposite green COG line - whichever comes first. This is what Endroute does and since he has the most experience this is what I do. It keeps things very simple. Obviously if your 50 pips up and just want to go to bed - close the trade. Or if theres big news coming protect what you already have. But as you've seen when this method works it works well. Theres no point getting stopped out at BE and trhen worrying about the pips you could of should of would of made if you had closed the trade earlier... Be greatful it wasn't a loss and take comfort in the fact that the next "bus" is around the corner and the next win will eventually come. As for 80 pip SL antuque I know you ended with green pips but still you should learn to cut your losses. Endroute recommended 20 pip SL and I think you should try sticking with that. This system seems to have a great R:R ratio so even if you are stopped out half the time you will still make a nice profit. Obviously this is just my opinion. Good trading

--- 帖子 #541 ---
The trades ended negative for me, too. EURGBP -20 pips EURUSD -6 pips ... forgot one trade ... AUDUSD yesterday at 2008.07.17 18:00 +52 pips

--- 帖子 #542 ---
looks like tere were 3 bad entries on the EU in a row yesterday!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
... there is no perfect system ... there are only systems that wins more then they lose I also using 20pips SL. If I reached BE + 20 pips I usually start to trail the stop.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Enough for yesterday's &amp; today's trades.... One that can give heart attack... My recent short entry on GU (at 1.9961) already hit TS at 1.9929 with +32pips My short entry at EU (opened since yesterday), just closed manually at 1.5837 with only +3pips I think it won't come down anymore (IMHO), sooo choppy.. I think I better rest now, since I am restless since yesterday... USD News impact a lot.... &amp; I did badly yesterday when enter those trades, but luckily I was so confident ( ) that the price will come back down &amp; set the SL so high (about 80 pips)....

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Good for you, still profit as total (+26pips)... only depend on how many lot/s for every pair.... Congrat...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thought of stopping today.... But, see a setup on making at GBP/JPY 1 Hr(known as Geppy).... Anyway, beware because Geppy is the most volatile pair... (UJ &amp; EJ as well)...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I got this ... my OpenPrice was 212.43 Just another question atuque1, why you took this trade on EUR/USD? The MA's signaled BUY not SELL. COG signaled SELL. I would only trade if COG and MA's would tell me the same.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
GBPJPY hit TS with +40 pips. BUY entry on USDCHF (1.0225). BUY entry on GBPCHF (2.0414).

--- 帖子 #549 ---
GJ was fun! travelled 70 pips in 5 minutes gotta love that

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Actually, the EUR/USD entry was a mistake (too early)... the MT4 hung-up when I was trying to enter short on GU... suddenly I saw it was entered on EU...then I just left it since I saw it followed my expected trend ... (I should closed it yesterday when already got 20 pips... before it went against me). About GBP/JPY, I also already entered Long at 212.42, &amp; set TS 35 pips (special for GJ only)....

--- 帖子 #551 ---
There is a good sell signal on EUR/USD and AUD/USD but it did not trade it because I have already 3 open positions. I also entered GBP/JPY (212.71) again ... All my positions reached BE

--- 帖子 #552 ---
My GJ Hit TS with +49 pips... ....Just small retrace Re-enter Long again on GJ, price at 213.04.... Because Trend Is Bullish.... (Trade At Your Own Risk)...

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Enough for today.... &amp; for this week..... going to sleep.... I closed GJ trade manually at 213.25 (18:33) with +21pips , when I saw consolidation at TF 5 Mins (Stoch also at 97... overbought). Late yesterday &amp; today are the hardest... Congrats to those who succeeded to get green pips... (My summary this week: 13 trades.... 12 greens, 1 BE) Real Account....

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Good results antuque catch ya next week

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi everybody, I'm a newbie,I happened to see this forum yesterday. I read from page 1 to last page. And printed out some important notes Thank you endroute for his work - the system is very simple easy to understand &amp; I think it suits me. by the way where is he? may be he's on holiday. Thank you Scratch,Cindy,Atuque &amp; all of you guys to keep this forum alive. And also I've gained some knowledge from you. See you pete

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi Cindy, You are one of the great guy in this forum http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif . I'ld like to ask you some questions if you don't mind. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif what's time normally do you trade? asian, europe or us session? which pairs for 1h &amp; 4h? or shorter time frame? Oh last one - What did you have problem with this system at beginning I saw you complained a lot. please let me learn from your expireince Thank you pete. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi Pete Thanks for that! Glad you called me a guy haha most people asume I'm female - funny that! I like the asian and london session and if I'm still not satisfied I will trade the London/US overlap (but thats a long day for me here in Australia). I guess the only session I don't trade is the plain US session. For one it's like 3am in Australia when that's on but also I hear it's the worst session to trade so I guess I'm lucky there! My favourite session is the London session but when the volitilitys there the Asian session is good too IMO. As for timeframe: I love the 1 hour charts don't trade much off the 4 hr charts because to me it feels like I'm watching paint dry! But for others I'm sure they like it. They say the higher timeframe the better because of less "noise" but I'm very comfortable on the 1hr TF. One thing I will say though is that I use the 4hr and Daily charts to draw trendlines as possible points of support and ressistance they can make great intraday targets and even filter out the more "dodgey" trades. I've traded shorter timeframes in the past but I find them a lot more unpredictable. As for this COG system in particular definetly nothing under the 1hr TF for me. Your last question is a bit more difficult to explain.... Yes in the begginning I was following this thread and when I put the COG on my charts I looked back on the past and saw many great trades that supported Endroutes claim that this system can regularly make 200 pips a day... But when I started watching them in real time I saw how much the COG repainted and realised that the trades I see in hindsight weren't necesarily there "for the taking" at the time and I had a few demo trades that went sour and immediatly blamed the repainting of the COG. I guess I jumped the gun a bit there because I've still been following this method and although the COG does repaint it still produces some great trades. THe R:R ratio (very important IMO) is good as well so although there might be a few losses the overall profit gain can far out weigh these losses from what I've seen so far. But seriously this is just me talking here it would be so much more valuable for your questions to be answered by Endroute as he is the true author of this method and has much more experience than me. Anyway welcome to the thread m8

--- 帖子 #558 ---
But seriously this is just me talking here it would be so much more valuable for your questions to be answered by Endroute as he is the true author of this method and has much more experience than me. Hi Cindy, Thank you for your answer &amp; tips that is very valueable to me,because I've never thought to draw tend lines at all( there are so many pairs to watch). But since you comment I think I'm going to do that too. I live in Sydney that why I ask you about your trading time (sorry to look at your profile - then i knew you live in Australia). It's good to know trading time of the person who live in the same zone. Then I can learn what's normal time they do thier trade because I'm a newbie. Sorry to call you guy - just get use to call guy instead of gal (I guess you are a lady if I'm not wrong) By the way do you trade gbp/jpy? sl 50 pips is rather high I'm a newbie it's not so good to disturb big master(endroute) I would rather ask young masters(you and some another guys). Because some of my questions might be very stupid - wait until I'm up in advance stage then I'll ask big master Agian thank you very much Cindy and hope you'll gain plenty of pips http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif Pete

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi pete Yes I like GBP-JPY but 50 pips SL is too much for my liking as well. What I do is just trade at half the lot size I normally would so for example say normally I trade at $1 a pip I'd lower the lot size to 5,000 which is .50 a pip. Don't worry about asking questions as stupid as you may think they are - It's the only way people can learn and that's what the threads for. I ask stupid questions all the time . I'm a guy by the way!!!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hi Cindy &amp; Pete.... I am agree with Cindy that 50 pips SL is too much... but only sometimes I just need to put higher due to unexpectable retracement (IMHO).... But normally, I will just put TS 25pips only when I really know that my setup is really good (just like what happen on GJ last week ). I hope that, scratch &amp; Cindy still keep up with this thread because I just start working again (after 2 weeks off) &amp; cannot get into trade/s with MT4 in my office desktop (blocked by Co, I guess...)... &amp; will see setup only in my night time (about 2hours diff from you guys... +8 GMT). So, keep it up guys...

--- 帖子 #561 ---

Long on USD/CHF...

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Stopped out -20 pips

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Me too. But I decided to trade the EUR/GBP because I could see many green candles after the cross last week, this should make my losses disappear

--- 帖子 #567 ---
30 mins to go home ... I'll be looking at chart later on... From other platform (not from my account), I see that GBP/CHF &amp; GBP/JPY is coming up again... Stoch already oversold.... But I cannot see COG (not available for this Platform )... Cannot wait to go home... See you guys later...

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hello All, Seems like yesterday was not a good day to trade, none have a good setup on COG... For scalper, might be good because 5mins TF shows some setup... But I won't risk my bits on that (experiences taught me)....

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Yes not much volatility yesterday on most pairs but EU and GU moved a bit... THere was this EUR USD trade later on...

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Still going strong and up 50 pips

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I was thinking to go Long last night, but the cross not yet happened (for all TF), so I left it without entry. Did you go long on GU or EU? If you did, lucky you..

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Didn't actually catch the EU went to bed before it happened but just noticed it this morning when I was flicking through charts.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
This strategy author says he trades some pairs at H4. How is it possible to use SL=20p at such big TF? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
The result should not relate to the timeframe you are using. The 4h candles just contain 4 1h candles. The price movement is the same.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Interesting point!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
These 2 days, seems like no good setup for any entry.... Wierd huh? Before this, at least one good setup for entry... Maybe because of fundamental issues &amp; oil price dropped

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Got a position on GBP/USD (1.9951). Already reached BE

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Good on you.... Able to catch that.... I'll be waiting GU to come back down.... Will see again tonite....

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Very nice one scratch

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Closed @ 2.0005 = +54 pips

--- 帖子 #581 ---
That is so good &amp; I am happy for you....

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi All, After a few observations on EU, saw a nice setup on 1 Hr TF &amp; on 5 Mins already bearish trend. I go Short @ price 169.25, with TS 25pips &amp; SL 75 pips (reason: price hardly to pass above 169.95, so I set SL at 170.00 with spread). Good Luck, T.A.Y.O.R....

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Morning All, At my workplace, I can only see different trading platform... &amp; cannot see my trades .... But, I can see my entry last night is still good &amp; in profit (current price is 169.08) meaning that I am on green (+17 pips) .... That's whyI put TS at 25 pips.... hopefully the price will move down &amp; at least move my SL to BE.... Good Luck guys...

Hi, How to make EA to email you alert? thanks.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Use the SendMail function and configure your email options in MT. But, by the way I don't think this is the right thread to ask MQL or MT questions ... By the way I got an sell entry on EUR/JPY (169.31) yesterday. Hit TS with 169.25 ... +6 pips.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Good.... EJ still coming down.... Do you enter again just now? (I hope mine still in the trade &amp; not hit TS yet, but I know I am on the green already b'cos my TS is 25 pips..... aarrrgghh... cannot see my trades here... )

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Got one on EUR/CHF @ 1.6270 The green candle closed over the green line. @ atuque1 no cross no entry ... I strictly follow the rules

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Good entry Scratch.... I also follow rules now, &amp; I think my trade on EJ last nite is on the green... 15 mins more will be off from office..... Can't wait to see my trade....

--- 帖子 #589 ---

Thanks for this strategy, it is very solid and appears to work because its based on failed breaks, failure highs and lows... Ive been looking for something like this thanks for helping us on our way!

Does anyone know how to program the COG into GFT's Chart Studio?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I have GFT too but not sure if this can be done - I just use the interbank mt4 demo account for my charts and GFT to trade works fine for me

--- 帖子 #596 ---
I got this too @ 0.9596 and it already reached BE

--- 帖子 #597 ---
does interbank let you have the demo for ever? Maybe Mt4 can be subscribed to?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Im new to Mt4, how do i get this to work in mt4?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I think you are getting better (or just more frequent) signals on the 1H charts than I'm getting on the daily charts. August tends to be nasty anyway and we are almost there. I'm going to move to trading 1H, although I will surely miss some trades that happen at weird hours. But I'm usually checking things a few times a day. Thanks to endroute for a basic system, and his emphasis of our trading mentality over system mechanics. Once I am comfortable with my timeframes, I'll perhaps post trades that I saw as valid.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Just download the platform from interbank fx website... I think they last for 3 months (the demo accounts) but after that you can just make a new one and transfer all your templates and indicators etc to the new platform. The indicators and templates all posted here are for MT4... Once you create your account let me know and I will show you how to set it up. Itr's not complicated

--- 帖子 #601 ---
hello, Download from Alpari or Alpari-US as well. Their demo's do not expire unless you do not use them for a certain number of days. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Ok didnt know that cheers

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Sorry... Forgot to update my AUD/USD... This morning, before I went to office, saw my entry reached TP with +30 pips.... Yummy!!! &amp; Remember, today is Friday... Becareful, since everybody is trying to get more profit before close for this week.... I guess, I am out for today... Good Luck Guys...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi Cindy &amp; Mabenn, Try Fxpro broker for fxpro MT4 practice(demo) account it's unlimited time with lots of features Goodluck, Pete

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hello, can you give me the latest EA you developed for this system? I'm trying something different using the CoG and I want to see how your system works. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #606 ---
As far as Im aware there is no EA for this system yet though Im sure it would be very easy to make one but don't ask me!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thanks Pete!

--- 帖子 #608 ---
That's true, the demo account has unlimited time. Only that, to enter trade at least with US$100 per trade (minimum)... I am using This for my Real Account (after confident with this system). This one, I can open 4 type of accounts (smallest, small, big &amp; biggest).... Not promoting, but I can enter trade with only US$1.00... that's the best...

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Tonite, I don't see any good setup or any 'become-setup'..... I will just see only, before go to sleep.... while watching TV.... See you guys again next week.....

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi All, I am new to this thread and system as of this week. I set up my charts and watched for 3 days. I made my 1st trade, using this system, yesterday am, short on the JPY/USD. I TP at +50 pips. I continued to fall over night for another 60 pips. Oh well, I'm happy with +50 I entered GBP/USD this morning and TP at another +50 because it stalled out at the daily R1. I'm using a live acct. with a small lot until I become more confident in this system, but 2 trades in 2 days for +100 pips is a good start. It's too bad that endroute has left the thread for some reason, but I'd like to see it continue so that we can learn from each other. By the way, can someone tell me how to post my chart's. Thanks

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hi RVD, I am also agree that this system can be really profitable if we trade the setup. Thanks to Endroute to bring up this system , &amp; the others who makes it better (with the 'no-repainting' JB COG Indy). Be confident but not to be too confident, until you the rules applied accordingly. Only with this system, I gain profits continuously on 15 trades.. Even though Endroute is not here (we always hope he'll be here soon), the others can also discuss &amp; give their ideas regarding this COG &amp; EMA (5 &amp; 13) System. To post chart, go to the below "Additional Options", then click the "Manage Attachments", then attach your post there. Good Luck Guys...

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hey RVD Welcome to the thread - To post charts right click on your chart and go to "save picture as" then save it somewhere (you can delete it after you post it if you want) THen when you are writing a reply to the thread just click on the little paper clip icon in the toolbar (next to the smiley face) and it will take you to the attachments screen... THen click "browse" and find where you saved your chart - Once you find your chart click "ok" And then "Upload" - Do this as many times as you want to add more charts and when you are done you can close the attachments box and when you submit your post the chart will appear under what you wrote. Hope this helps Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi All, I saw setup on EUR/AUD 1Hr, to go long (buy). Candle closed below Gold Line, EMA already crossed Up (between green-gold) &amp; CoG are trending Up (for filtering). I entered on price 1.6468. (with 70pips SL &amp; 15 pips TS, &amp; 20 pips TP) BUT take note that this pair has biggest spread.... GOOD LUCK...

--- 帖子 #614 ---
A post last month from endroute says... "Scratch nice work this is cool. There may be some more optimum settings that can be applied to the cog. As for me no trades this week I am on vacation, and most of all no trades on nfp days, no system can keep you from killing yourself on these days." So no trading this Friday! I'd like to have all my positions closed out by COB Thursday. I'm trading the 4H charts on about 10 pairs. All are doing well, except for one trade which I took on the daily charts which went against me. I'm waiting for it to come back up (this is on AUD/JPY btw). The hourly charts are too time intensive for me, and on the dailies you can wait forever for a valid setup. I think picking the correct timeframe based on your availability to check the market is important. Is endroute back from vacation yet?? His last several posts on trading psychology were very good.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Nah Pigeon haven't heard from him for weeks - It's a shame really I think we could of learnt a lot from him... Maybe one day he will pop in to check on his old thread !

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi, I am just getting familiar with this system. Based on the rules, it looks like there are two good setups on this 1h chart. The first is a sell and the second is a buy. The sell looks really good, the buy looks so-so. Can anyone advise on if I am reading MA/COG right?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi Jerz, Happy to see that you can get familiarize with this system. The COG you are using is the original version of COG from Endroute (thanks to him), and hope you realize that it is repaints by itself. Here, I give another revised COG which doesn't repaints (I forgot who edited it)... thanks to him too. Good luck guys....

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Yes they are both valid signals Jerz although the buy looks like the MA's crossed a little late. As antuque said it's the original COG so those 2 signals may not have actually been there for the taking at the time. Get the new JB COG going and compare the two and you will see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Yeah, I see what you mean... with the JB COG neither one appear as a valid signal. That leaves me wondering... does that mean a lot of lost trade opportunities or just safer trades... hmmm. I imagine the later. Here is a chart to compare the two COG's.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Not necesarily lost trade opportunities - Just different ones I guess. You can look back over the charts with the JB COG to see how many. Just one point you may already know but BOTH the COGS will give the same signals in REAL time. It's just the past that makes a liar out of the original COG It was scratch by the way who made the non repaint COG

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Actually missing the trade opportunity is better than losing in trades.... (I experience this a lot)... With this system, at least the COG filtered a lot of bad entries.... **And Yes, Scratch was the one who create the non-repaint COG**

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Thanks for this is interesting and helpful info. All the while I have the same idea that the COG made by scratch missed out on alot of trades when I scroll the chart back to check on the MA crossovers.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Ain't that the truth sitting on the side is trading too... I'm going to work with this system some on my demo account to see how it plays in forward / real time rather then trying to look back on it... I've been reading a lot of the post and wonder, why care if COG repaints? If the signals are valid at the time of the trade... why should it really matter? I do like to be able to look back and study the chart so I imagine the non-repainting one would be good for that.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Got it in one!

--- 帖子 #625 ---
As what I see from other platform's chart (in my office, no MT4 &amp; cannot open my account)..., I see my trade consolidated lower from my entry, until this last hour, start to go UP.... Following my Setup....

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hello Endroute, Read about The Art Of Trading MAs..I a kinda lik it..But d problem is I saw no indicator called COG on my Mt4...Wats d full meanin n is it on Mt4 platforms??Ur reply wil b of great importance...Keep d spirit up....

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hello SpunkyRich... COG means Centre of Gravity ... You can just pick the one in 1st page of this thread (the Original from Endroute) and also the other one called "JB COG" in http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=617 ....

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Looks like setup to buy (going-to-be) on EUR/USD &amp; GBP/USD.... Both candles at below Gold Line. Will wait for the candles close Up below gold or green. Be patient.....

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Bad trade for me... on the EUR/AUD .... Consolidated at 1.6437.... &amp; at last after news time, USD increased &amp; affected on EUR &amp; also on the pair I traded.... Hit my stop loss... with -60pips .... Lesson for me, should choose pairs with lower spread..... I have to accept this lose.... My fault anyway.... Good Luck Guys...

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Atuque , Cindy and other members....... I had been following this method from two weeks and demoing to check its usefulness. Good job Cindy and Atuque you guys are keeping up this thread after endroute left... Atuque are you on a real account or demoing?? And I have some doubts, how many trades on an average are you guys doing per day using this method......I kinda feel I am missing too many trades because of no clear signal and whats the average outcome after a week of trading.....I am asking this because many a times I could not gain much from a trade and the EMA cross came very close to the entry point but when the trade went bad it usually hit my stoploss of 60 pips. So overall I was in loss last week I am sure the system is good but could not figure out the problem. Thanks. Abhishek.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Abhishek, I am on real account (minilite account), can trade start with only $1. As far as I use this system, it is good for filtering good &amp; profitable trades. Before this, I lost so much... till only $3.50 left in my account. Then I seriously use this system, carefully till today.... I gained back $17.00 after 17 trades (straight without losing). All that trades, I monitored closely... But yesterday, entered a bit late....before sleep, then, set SL 70 pips. &amp; TS 15 pips... Just now, hit my SL at 60 pips (i moved SL up, when the price followed my trend)... so after 17 consecutive winnings &amp; profit hundreds of pips... (gain more than 100% of my deposits), only tonite I lost 60 pips.... Anybody to try this system, try on demos first.... gain your confidence.... Then, trade the system....

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hi Atuque.....thanks for the reply......Good to hear that you have full confidence in the system...... If you could tell how many trades you took last week so that I could compare my performance (did I take too many trades) coz I lost more than I won... And also do you usually set the SL and TS for every trade and if the trade goes in your favour you shift the SL to break even..... I am lacking in money management I guess so any help would be appreciable. Thanks, Abhishek.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hmm, looks like the EJ and GU are both getting close to buy signals on 1h. Anyone else see that?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hi Atuque, I've been following this thread for about 2-3 weeks. You and Cindy are very good to keep this thread alive. And I beleive this system is working - anyway I'm trying on demo now but still thinking which time frame &amp; pairs are suitable for me. Atuque, which time frame are you using? how many pairs? &amp; which pairs are you trading? The reason why you setted SL 70 pips - it's very high Thank you, Pete

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I have confidence, but still have to be careful of my carelessness &amp; my impatience. I will always see the setup on 1 Hr TF first... then I will look at 5 mins or 15 mins TF, if it is a good time to enter... if it does not going the way the 1 Hr TF, will wait a little bit more. Last week, I only managed to enter 3 trades due to my work &amp; in my office I couldn't monitor MT4 Platform &amp; couldn't see my trades. So, I just entered those 3 trades at night before sleep. (After entered trades, will see if the price goes in my favour or not. If follow in my favour, will set SL at BE, &amp; set TS 25 pips. If not, will set 50pips SL because sometimes retracement goes the other way before follow my favour)..... But anyway, this is my way... The week before last week, I was at home (time-off for 2 weeks), traded 13 trades (if I'm not mistaken), &amp; all trades were profits!! That was when I can monitor &amp; see my trades.... Now, hardly to enter trade because I am at work &amp; the only time is when I return home... &amp; see the trend, if there's any setup that I am confident, I will enter trade. If not, like last night, no trade....

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hi Atuque.....same problem for me too......after office I dont have plenty of time to watch the trend so I miss out some good opportunities and thus in impatience took some not so good ones.....resulting in loss... Last week I took 1-2 trades per day far less than your numbers......this time I be more patient and take only A trades.... EUR/CHF, EUR/GBP, USD/CHF, EUR/JPY all are trending looks like possible setups picking up the better ones would be difficult Thanks, Abhishek.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi All good to see a few new comers to the thread. I heard someone ask about money management... Well IMHO I don't ever want to risk more than 20 -30 pips max because although I may get stopped out more I know that the big win is just around the corner. Whats the point having 17 wins in a row if one loss wipes out half of that? And what will that loss do to your confidence, and mental approach to up and coming trades. I don't kow bout you guys but I would be seriously stressed - all that work gone! Remember we're here to make money bottom line. LEarn to accept losses is key IMO. As for the ammount of trades per day I'm only watching 1 hr time frame personally I think any lower is too noisy and any higher is like watching paint dry. (That's just me I kow everyone is different) I think this system takes a lot of patience but as I'm beginning to learn not trading is in effect still trading... By not trading I am managing my money effectively by not throwing it away in a half assed trade. It's harder to do this when trading at $1 a pip because you feel the need to make 100 pips a day everyday ($100) I have been there myself and used to try and go to the market all the time instead of waiting for the market to come to me. AS for Endroutes comment about making 200 pips everyday - I am yet to see this consistanly done with this system (or any system for that matter) But you don't need to make 200 pips everyday to be successful 20 pips a day is surely enough... But pshycologically at $1 a pip $20 a day (20 pips) would surely make one go crazy after a while. - Watching charts for hours on end for $20 a day! I think you need to look at the bigger picture and realise that while (if) you're still learning then the money doesn't matter right now. Learn to make pips consistantly and then when you're 100% confident in yourself AND your system invest enough money in your account to make it worth while.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
The most often I traded were EUR/USD, GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY... all on 1 Hr TF for the setup. I set SL 70 pips because I entered a bit late (when I see on 15mins TF, the stoch already overbought, &amp; I know it will retrace a little bit)... But don't follow my way here, because I should enter buy when the TF15mins stoch showing oversold....

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Wise words . I dont believe on large SL as well. The way to wealth is based on series of small winning trades. especially these days were no clear trend exists, we should take profit when we see it (1:1 with the SL and move the SL to BE). The way to make money is to enlarge the lot size you trade, not to wait for a 120 pips move. BR Dani M.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Cindy, thanks for the insight. Many a times I had situations that the EMA crossover showed a specific trend but when I entered it is late (usual with moving averages). So when I enter the trade using the specific signal and it gets reversed what should I do?? Usually I set the SL a bit high so that spikes or retracement does not affect the trend....but if the trend is really reversed then the high Sl costs very dearly..... I was also thinking about hedging against the trend in case of reversal but that leaves me confused about when to exit the trade....whats your view. Thanks, Abhishek.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi May I'm not really sure I understannd your question bout when it reversers on you - Do you mean the MA's cross back or the price reverses? If you could post an chart with an example it might be easier to answer AS for your stops you summed it up in one you never know if a reversal is a shortterm retracement or trend reversal until it'dstoo late thats why you should keep it simle and just have a small stop to begin with If it takes you out and then goes in your direction - this is frustrating but just part of the game. THere will always be other trades. Thats my opinion HEdging against the trend: Wouldn't recommend it - If you're wrong you're wrong theres no shame in that happens to the best of them - trying to chase the market is suicide in those situations. Keep things simple is best. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #642 ---
As Atuque said he checks the oversold/bought condition before entering on a lower TF using stoch, what do you guys use as entry techniques and if using the stoch do you check it only after the EMA cross has happened?? I am in my office right now so cann't post charts...will post it later in the evening IST......but please help me with the doubts so I can try them when I see my terminal. My doubt is e.g. EMA shows down crossover (bearish) but when I enter the price is lower than the crossover point. So the entry price is lower than the crossing point which makes it prone to change, if the next bar starts moving up (bullish) nearing my SL should I just let it happen or I should hedge it as it may take a bit more time to continue the trend than my Sl limit........I hope I am clear this time. Thanks, Abhishek.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hello, 1st of all: thanks to endroute for sharing his system, and all the advises he gave (it clearly shows he's an experienced trader). I discovered this thread more than a month ago, and it "captured my eye", since it was similar to one of the things I've been pursuing (filtering MA crosses), only I was using other indicators to do that. This is the 3rd or 4th time I come back to this thread and I've read it all. But I'm still strulling to having it work smoothly for me. - Yes I did find COG acted strange when looking at the charts posted here and my own at the same times - it was the repainting... - The idea of having it printing on the screen the past lines (and remaining there) did cross my mind - glad someone did it, because i wouldn't know how. Thanks for the guy that did that. Initially I was just trying to test, going for the gold line setups only, on H1...those do not happen that often. Reading more carefully, and seeing many of the charts posted here, I see that the main rule is (for H1): - wait for price to close beyond the green line - wait for the emas 5/13 cross after that. But I got the idea (maybe wrong) that when we are about to enter, if price has already crossed the central cog line to the "other side", than we should refrain from entering. Looking at my charts, that happens most of the time! At least on H1... Should we enter in that situation (if it hasn't gone far beyond that line and/or the candle that closed is not very big)? Endroute did mention that the cross should be near the green line...so I'm confused...I don't see that many setups in this case.... I mostly test systems on usd/chf...is it the pair? (I'm seeing the same situation right now on gbp/usd (at 19h15 london time). Thanks. M

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Fx, I think you are doing most everything correctly. But that doesnt mean that you'll have instant setups, esp. only watching one pair. The gold line setups are just that - gold. I've traded a few of them w/o waiting for the MA's to cross, if they looked good on other timeframes. The green line setups, IMO, require a MA cross for confirmation. But if the cross happens at or near the center line, I forget about the trade and move on, not enough margin left for profit. I'm watching about 10 pairs. I'm doing well on about 60% of them, and had trades go against me on the other 40%. I'll probably adjust my stops so that I get out of the bad trades sooner. The good ones more than make up for those. I am still studying which exit rules to use as well. As far as any filters - don't try to enhance the system, it works fine the way it is. This is an EXCELLENT time for testing, as August is a slow month for trading, we are likely to see the worst whipsawing and lack of liquidity for the next several weeks. Any system that at least keeps us at break-even during August is a good one in my book. I do use one filter though.... I trade in the direction of the COG! So if it's heading down, I don't look for buy trades until it reverses and swings upwards. As far as the repainting.....I think you can do just as well with either indicator, but I find the old one easier on the eyes. Whew, that was a long rant! Back to work....

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hi everebody, just finished read whole thread. Very interesting system.. and i decide to demoing for a while.... My setup is: 4H TF for all pairs, open 3 position, SL 25 pips (GJ 50), TP1 25 (GY 5)0, TP2 50 (GY 100), TP3 EMA crossover...i will try post every trade + results.. first trade: GY - buy@214.20

--- 帖子 #646 ---
one more thing: after reach TP1 - move SL to BE+1

--- 帖子 #647 ---
first trade, firs lose...3x50pips.. TOTAL -150 pips

--- 帖子 #648 ---
That's a lot of pips you have lost.... Hope that's not on real money...

Is this a valid signal?

yes, just a demo...

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Be patient sikacek.... Don't just enter trade for the sake of "at least I must have a trade" way of thinking... I have gone thru that before... Lost a lot... BTW, today I am so frustrated because my trade on EUR/AUD last day (which was stopped with loss of 60pips) are bullish today... going with my way... Damn!! If I would let it flow last time, I might profit at least 50 pips already.... But what to do, past is past..... Anyway, who would expect that, right? Maybe It will Go Down further... Who knows...

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi guys Good thread you have going here even though the original author abandoned it. My first question is: for those of you who trade the 1H TF, assuming you cant stay up for days, what do you do about open trades when you have to sleep at night and do you just shrug off signals that came while you slept? I'm kinda neurotic about being able to see every bar, so I can't trade above 15m or below the 4H. Keep up the good work! /P.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I am patience .. but if you take look on 4H EY, that entry will be still valid.. price was below bottom green line on COG and EMA's are setup for long.. the problem is tight SL during a news.. IMO ..so I go try reenter, will see what hapend...

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Yes, the price will be still valid, but as for me, need to see the lower TF to make the entry.... because in 4Hr TF, 1 candle is a big range... that's just from me, not sure about others...

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi All, I see setup to buy at GBP/CHF 1 Hr TF. The price already reached below gold line. Candle closed below green line, and EMA crossed up (also crossed below the green line). Enter Buy at price 2.0767. T.A.Y.O.R. (trade at your own risk) -ATUQUE-

--- 帖子 #662 ---
you right, on 1H TF looks to me like good setup for short... EMA's almost cross.. will see..

--- 帖子 #663 ---
isn't too late for entry? ema's crossed 4h ago..??

--- 帖子 #664 ---
a have question.... will be that one valid entry?? price closed below green, but EMA's are for long period set for LONG and didn't cross for Short.. any comments?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
The markets are getting volatile before the news release tomorrow...good time to stay away. I had three trades stopped out in last night's reversal, 2 for profit and 1 for a loss. I was glad I moved my stops up on the two that were good trades for the week.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Yes, IMO that can be a valid entry because it's passing thru gold line. But if I want to enter (buy) that, I will see the 1 Hr also, so that I enter when the price is going up....

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hello all, At my office I see the price of GBP/CHF has already gone up to +25 pips, so when I went back for lunch, I moved my SL to BE (at my entry time, set SL 40 pips before gone to bed last nite). &amp; I set my TP at 80 pips. - because this is GBP/CHF quite volatile like GBP/JPY. Good luck guys &amp; to me too..

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Luckily I set the SL at BE... GBP free-fall (still don't know what caused it) Anyway, tonite I'll stay away from any entry... so much news... See you next week....

Really interesting system. Has an EA been developed yet? If so, can someone post the download link?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Not to my knowledge no

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hello All, I saw a setup on EUR/AUD 1 HR. Nice candle closed between bottom green &amp; gold line, then EMA crossed UP. Stoch also showing up-trending. I entered long (buy) at price 1.6759. T.A.Y.O.R.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Another setup for short (sell) on AUD/USD 1 Hr TF. I entered short at price 0.9296. T.A.Y.O.R.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hello, Can someone clarify which indicator is being used at this point (for those who are actively trading it) to trade this strategy as well as the settings to input since it appears there is at least 2 floating around in this thread. Thanks alot, CFII

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hello CFII, We are using EMA5, EMA13, and JB-CoG (Centre of Gravity - non-repaint). The setting, can be seen in the 1st page of this thread by Endroute (wondering where is he now, we need him as the guru...) Attached herewith is the JB-COG &amp; the EMA-cross-alert.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Thanks for clarifying that atuque. The settings on page 1 refer to "SNAME - 500" but i don't see this input on the JB CoG indicator. CFII

--- 帖子 #676 ---
The setting for the JB CoG, will be same except the SNAME (which already taken out, to avoid repainting...) BARS BACK - 240 M - 4 I - 0 KSTD - 1.0

--- 帖子 #677 ---
After came back from work, happy to see my LONG on EUR/AUD hit the TP with +60pips. &amp; Also hit TP on AUD/USD with +30pips Total +90pips today...

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Is it just me, or does the JB COG use a lot of resources? When I apply it to a chart, it takes a minute or more to display on the chart... in the mean time, MT4 hangs until it the indy finishes loading. It's even worse when trying to backtest it in an EA.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Me too having that "long-time-loading", but it is only at the beginning only, right? As for me, not really a problem &amp; I never do any backtesting in any EA. I just learn and still learning the best setup to enter at the best time.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
thanks for the system. looks real promising. Is there an indicator that will alert you to a change in direction of the COG? from bullish to bearish.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
No alert for the COG direction change. Only has the cross of EMA, because that is the main setup to see: see the candle close, then see the EMA, then enter. (some other indy can be used as well, but don't want to make it more complicated)...

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Any one with an EA yet for this interesting system?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hello All, Just now, I saw a setup to go SHORT on GU 1Hr. Candle closed above top green, EMA crossed Down. Added with Stoch heading down, I go Short with price 1.9527 TS set at 15 pips (will monitor), &amp; TP at 70 pips by now (maybe will change again). *Trade At Your Own Risk (T.A.Y.O.R.)

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hit my TS with green pips (+10pips). Setup still valid, entered Sell again at 1.9505, set TP at 1.9470.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
My TS Hit again with only +15pips... Time to sleep now... Total today: +25pips Enough today... See again tmrw...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
No but why don't you get your computer to make you one?

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hello All, Before news on USD just now, saw setup gonna be.... Waited till news, USD not affected... BTW, saw the Setup: Candle closed above green (before the "drop"), EMA crossed Down &amp; Stoch heading Down. - Signal for Sell. I enter SHORT at 1.5434.... T.A.Y.O.R.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
TP Hit with +76pips So Happy... Good Night. (BTW, tomorrow Friday... trade with care)

--- 帖子 #689 ---
You're certainly becoming the master of this method Antuque keep it up. Looks like we have a new thread owner lol

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hi Cindy, I'm not the new thread owner, just want to share with those who want to become serious trader (like me ).... Anyway, I am not a serious trader as well, but I want to trade as my side income (I hope).... Other methods are also good, but maybe do not really suit me (sometime win, sometime lose). This method really make me feel more confident on my entry, maybe it suits me a lot... So far, from the day I seriously use this method with 24 trades, 23 were profits &amp; only 1 loss (but, because hit my SL sharply before following again my favour...). Anyway, I am happy because from my real account which left only 315units (on 11July08), now it's already 3335units... Thanks to Endroute for this magnificent method....

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Good Stuff Also I think a lot of people have come and gone from this thread because they would try a few trades and it didn't work out so on to the next big thing! But you have stuck withh it and made it work for you and I think that's great. AS they say any method can work but it's the trader that makes it or breaks it. I think by now you must have an "eye" for the good set ups. Maybe you could enlighten us on trades you wouldn't take... What I mean is trades where evrything lines up perfectly but for some reason you wouldn't take it. 23 out of 24 is a great record and you must be doing something to filter out the bad ones because I know there has been a few. Anyway any input would be great. I also noticed you have another MA on your charts is this to determine the trend? Cheers

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Yes, I forgot to mention about the other EMA (50 EMA - purple in color) - to determine the trend (if going down, just think about sell), and the Stoch (10,3,3 for 1 Hr TF; &amp; 14,3,3 for 4 Hr) - to see if it's good time to enter buy or sell by looking at the overbuying or overselling. But that is just my way to filter it... Other people might use other indi to filter the entry point. But the main setup will be the CoG (JB COG) &amp; the EMA13 &amp; EMA5.... that's THE MAIN ONE....

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Tonight is Friday, I just tried scalping on EU &amp; GU (because I see the price keep going down but not yet pass thru the bottom green line)... And I managed to gain small profits by using TP on EU ( +20pips , enter Short 1.5121 &amp; TP Hit at 1.5101 ) &amp; by using TS on GU ( +17 pips , enter Short 1.9231 &amp; TS Hit at 1.9174 ).... then I don't dare to enter anymore, because end of Friday is not good me to trade.... See you next week.... Happy pipping....

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hello all, I'm new to this thread and system, but have been trading currencies for the better part of the past 6 years. I'm also new to the MT4 platform and am basically reviewing it to see if I can get by on it so that I don't have to waste $$$ on my ESignal subscription. I've read every single post since page 1 in this thread and am glad to see how this system has evolved into a backtestable system (thanks to a key development from Scratch). I have a request for Scratch (or any other MT4 programmer). Is it possible to make an addition to the JB COG indicator that would email the user once a bar closes above/below the green support/resistance line? I am a part time trader and a full time student. It would be nice to get an email notification once price is in the target area and then I can make my way to a computer and wait for an EMA crossover. Thanks for listening. I will intently keep reading the posts in this thread (despite any apparent lack of participation as I tend to be a reader of threads and less of a poster). Cheers

--- 帖子 #695 ---
so basically with this indicator you buy when the arrow is green on the time frame you are using. is that right? the added confirmation would be more arrows moving in the same direction.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
lookslike will be a nice setup......

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Which Indicator are you referring to?

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Look like it... but need to confirm where the candle will close. BTW, have you try the JB CoG as well? Now, looks like USD/CHF is crossing DOWN,.... will go below gold (i guess).... wait till it cross-UP, then enter BUY with care... And the EUR/USD is crossing UP,.... will go above gold (i guess).... wait till it cross-DOWN, then enter SELL with care... Patience is the key to success...

--- 帖子 #699 ---
still searching for JB COG.....i've just installed a new windows for my laptop and all the templates were gone..... OP sell on Eur/usd and long usd//chf just now....confirm it with other system i have.....

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hello All, 1st day of the week.... I saw setup on GBP/JPY 1 Hr TF, candle already closed above the green. EMA already crossed Down..... Adding with CoG is trending Downward.... Good Setup for Sell on GBP/JPY.... I entered Short at 211.01. T.A.Y.O.R. Good Luck. p/s: waiting for EU &amp; GU setup for selling.....

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Here I got the JB COG for you....

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Another setup seen on EUR/JPY 1 Hr TF, candle already closed above the green. EMA already crossed Down. Adding with CoG is trending DOWN. Good Setup for Sell on EUR/JPY.... I entered Short at 164.76. T.A.Y.O.R. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
thanks a lot ya.....really appreciate it..... congrats to ur GJ..... i don't trade cross pair.....don't know the reason la.... not confident in cross pair......

--- 帖子 #704 ---
I'm trading based on this method and RSI for support. I went short on GBPJPY and EURJPY as well. It looks good so far. Thanks for everybody contributes to this thread. I'm pretty confident to take a trade since I got JB COG.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Question about the JB_COG... Does anybody experience long delays when switching from one time frame to another? It's almost like there's a loop bug somewhere in the coding... although I know nothing of programming. Just something that I'm wondering about. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I don't think that's bug. it just takes some time to switch around. BtW. I didn't take a profit from the two trades I made.... It came back I'm in negative right now. I hope these are gonna go down again.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I put 25 pips TS (trail stop) just now.... &amp; both trades hit my trades... My EJ, hit TS with +26pips ..... &amp; My GJ hit TS with +27pips . But in between, I sell on EU which is not so good... stopped at -37pips . Total... only +16pips .... Will see any other setup...

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Setup for EUR/USD still on the bearish -&gt; EMA crossed DOWN, Candle closed between Top Green and Gold. (for addition, I see EMA50 still bearish also) So, I sell again at 1.4998. GJ also still has valid setup.... Enter short at 210.77. T.A.Y.O.R.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Both of those look good. GL

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Today. You can't lose with any pairs. I saw so many chances and it all went with our direction. I sold GBPUSD. EURUSD and AUDUSD are also valid to sell.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
My Short on EU Hit TP, with +50pips . .... Total for today, +66pips.... Need to go to bed now.... set SL on GJ with 50 pips....

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I got 104+ pips today from my GJ, EJ, and GU trade. I didn't play too well on GJ (I got 5 pips) I close my trade since I gotta go bed. All I need is 20 pips per day. 100 pips per week. 400 pips per month. With standard lot, that'll give me freedom. BTW, I'm currently trade with mini lot.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Congrats Kim00gibson, You got 5x more than what you need Me too, last night got +66 pips closed on EJ, GJ and EU... &amp; now my other Short on GJ still floating with +25pips already locked as my SL (before go to work today)... Good Trades today &amp; good to hear a lot of you getting good result from this setup...

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Good Pippin chaps!

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I got stopped out on EURCHF. There is NO SYSTEM, you can win 100%. RISK vs REWARD ratio is the key to success. I also went short on UJ... I'll see what this one does.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Just returned back from work. See my trade on GJ got stop-out when hit TS with +25pips . So total for yesterday's entry = +91 pips... Will look forward for good setup....

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Good setup on the GBP=CHF on the 4 hr chart. Happy piping

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hello All, I see setup to sell on EUR/JPY.... Candle already closed between green &amp; gold, EMA crossed DOWN, &amp; the stoch (additional) is trending down.... &amp; the price is below the 50EMA (bearish time).... I entered Short at 163.92. Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #719 ---
TS hit at 163.83 (+9 pips only)... Since the setup is still valid, reentered Short at 163.71 with TS 25 pips &amp; TP set at 162.85. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I took the same trade at 163.92. I got out with 40 pips+. I got out early because I didn't like the COG on 4H and I wanna go to the bed. You know you wanna have sweet dream. I took two losses today. so I'm -20 pips today. Not too bad!! I made 100+ yesterday.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
AAhhhh... TS hit again, with only +4 pips!!! (total +13pips on EJ)... Before that, entered Short on EU at 1.4884. Set TP at 1.4844 (the blue line). Going to sleep now....

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Hey. Do you follow endroute's rules and which timeframe do you trade on?

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I think we need to figure out the exit strategy. I usually get out too early not waiting for EMA cross happens which the original system said. I would make so much more if my exit strategy is better. I saw the setup in USDJPY but I didn't take it... Another thing I noticed is that EMA cross Alert repaints. It's more like sometimes arrow disappear.... if you look at UJ on H1 frame. You see the green crosses right next to. There was a red arrow down. I know it because I took the trade lol

--- 帖子 #724 ---
i always open two positions but divide the quantity....one say TP for about 40 pips and one always let it free without TS until ema cross.......u can make it ur way guys....... ps: sorry for my poor english.....

--- 帖子 #725 ---
So worried on my EU trade.... Still floating on red, &amp; I am at work, looking at the chart on diff platform. After EMA crossed last night, just go sideways.... damn, shouldn't trade that last night (maybe my eyes too sleepy &amp; wrong timing for the entry... setup was there already)... Hope that the price on EUR will drop again...

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I didn't see the signal yesterday on EU... What time frame are you looking at?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
The EU, I think already touched my SL (at 1.4968) because I am still in office... cannot see my trades, only can see other platform. I looked at 1 Hr TF yesterday, the candles closed above top green, &amp; already going down passing the EMA, but that's where I made mistake... EMA's have not crossed yet !!. I should not enter that trade. I lost -84 pips from yesterday's EU trade...

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Came back from office. See the signal for sell on AUD/USD (at the office, saw the trend already, but need to confirm with COG). So, I Shorted on AUD/USD at 0.8676 T.A.Y.O.R

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Just now, the price has gone back up (retrace) to max of 0.8723.... So, when bearish again, at 16:01 enter Short again with double the size at 0.8711 (set TS 25pips) Then first 2 trades hit TS at 0.8658 (2x 18pips = 36 pips). Then 3rd trade hit TS as well at 0.8666 (with +45 pips, total +90pips). So, total pips I got was +126pips (cover back my loss this evening).

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Wow can you believe the ozzie is only buying 86 US cents. What a drop. All I can say is it's gonna be a fun ride back up. Seems like only yesterday we were near equal to the US dollar but look back at August last year the EXACT same thing happened. August is a crazy trime to trade with the Big money in Europe going on holidays and creating these mega thin markets. Things should return to normal come September after the US labour day. All I can say is WOW

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I took usd/chf short at 1.0843. EMA cross at green line. TP at 1.0817 which is the other side of the green line. gl

--- 帖子 #732 ---
I shouldn't try to second guess myself. Yesterday there was a decent setup (not perfect) on the 4H for EUR/GBP. But I was unsure about it, so I exited after a few hours at break even. Today, that trade would be up 130 pips! Well, you can't win em all... I did catch the sell trade on JPY and am still in that trade, will stay until the M/A crosses again.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Yea that has happened to me b4. It feels like a loss after getting out and seeing it later go your way. But like you said can't win them all. Did the 5 ema go against you on that one? Maybe you should have waited for it to go the other way b4 getting out.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
What was your TS... I lost -70 on that AUDUSD trade.... I didn't want to sleep now lol

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Hi Kim, What method are you using to set TP to work out Risk:Reward ratio? Thanks, Pete.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Setting TP is VERY HARD decision. it's harder than the entry I think. I usually use pivot point or green lines. I decided depend on looking on 4H. BUT. I lost a lot yesterday because of not setting TS... SO just like I said.. IT"S SO HARD TO SET TP

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Normally, if I monitor the trades, I will put TS 25-30pips in quite volatile market (normally EJ &amp; GJ, &amp; pairs with CHF); TS 25 pips on AUD/USD, EU &amp; GU; &amp; TS 15 pips on slower pairs. Last nite, the AUD/USD setup was good at beginning &amp; went into my favour, then after it hit my TS (with +126pips on 3 entries), the price shot Up.... May be caused by news on US Business Inventories...

--- 帖子 #738 ---
It is hard to set TP.... As for me, I will set TP at the opposite Green Line or Blue Line at time of entry.... If I am not confident, I will just put 25pips TP.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Using support and resistance points is also a good guide... Like for example if you are targeting the opposite green line but the 4hr trend line is just before it then obviously the trend line is the place for your TP. Also watch the momentum of the trade if it's moving along powerfully then let it ride. If it seems to be struggling close it earlier.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Thanks for great posts from experienced traders. I usually look only H1 for the signals. What would you do if M15 and H4 says over bought and H1 says "BUY" You can see it on EURCHF setup right now. BTW EUR news is on the way. so you might wanna wait for that.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Well if you think about it it means the H4 and 15m charts are trending and then the 1 hour signalling further movement in that direction. Thats how I'd interpret it anyway, theres a great thread on here about using Multi timeframe stochs you should check it out: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=31790 Not to trade the method but just to learn how the stochs work togeather over different timeframes I dunno might help. It's all summed up on the first page of this link so no need to read an entire thread.!

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hello All, I saw setup on EUR/USD 1 Hr TF, Candle closed already below Lower Green, EMA closed UP, &amp; Stoch heading UP. Entered LONG at price 1.4943. T.A.Y.O.R... Good Luck...

--- 帖子 #743 ---
This currency pair was very volatile because of news at the time of entry. Use extreme caution when trading around the news. I hope this trade goes your way.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Loss on this (-103pips)... Should not go for BUY, price still below EMA50!!! Ranging prices... Bad Trade!!! ____________________________________________________________________________________________ Another setup for GU 1 Hr, Signal for SELL. Enter SHORT at 1.8693.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
I got in the same trade at 1.8677. I got out with 17 pips+. Price will be ranging in Jap and Eur market today. It's a holiday over there. I might trade in the U.S. market but it's Friday. I might play soccer or something lol

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Thank you Kim,Atuque &amp; Cindy for TP setting. Now I know how to set TP. Pete

--- 帖子 #747 ---
pete.alfa Can you tell us more in details on your understanding of the TP setting in this system? thanks

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi quicker, I'm going to follow this TP setting, I think it's logic &amp; easy to do Thanks Cindy for TP info &amp; also thanks for multi timeframe stochs your post#741. It's very very good info. Pete.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
NO worries - may it serve you well - I've found the 4 hr trend line used for targets when i'm trading off a 4 hr 1 hour 15 and 5 minute chart to be one of the best guides as it often hits it to the pip before reversing. To draw them properly just read the chart from right to left and use the latest two swing points to draw them on..

--- 帖子 #750 ---
TP Hit at 1.8600 (+93 pips). That TP I set at the opposite Green Line (lower green).

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hello All, I saw setup for sell on GBP/CHF 1 Hr (also on 4 Hr - without EMA cross). I entered Short at price 2.0387. T.A.Y.O.R. Good Luck for me too...

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Nice one Antuque.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thanks Cindy, I will keep posting my trades. We can share our experiences on any trade we made with the Setups. I have not see your trade yet, Cindy? **BTW, It's ATUQUE... not A N TUQUE... **

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I took the same trade and I saw the setup on GBPCHF. I went long 0.7942. Let me know what is your T/P for this trade. Mine is 2.0280 or EMA cross.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
OOPs sorry Atuque how long have I been doing that - I think after all this chart watching I might need some glasses! :nerd: Anyway sorry haven't been posting any trades lately to be honest I haven't been actively trading this method and so feel the need to leave the advices etc to the people that do, Atuque in particular. I still like to follow this thread everyday though. BTW I learnt a new thing for MT4 you may or may not know that you guys might find useful - You can set the platform with an Alarm if a certain price level is hit... Just go to "terminal" and in the window at the bottom there is a tab called "Alarm" click on that and then right click in the white space and go to "create" and then you can make a new alarm... Keep up the good work. Glad that this thread is still alive despite Endroutes departure. Heres one I just saw on EUR/JPY ... Will see how it goes

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I lost on GBPCHF trade. EURGBP is about to hit my stop. Oh well....

--- 帖子 #757 ---
This JB COG seems like a messed up bollinger band. I still like the original. Price is always outside one way or another with the JBCOG. Unless I'm doing something wrong. RWX

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Sorry for your loss... I am still in the trade GBPCHF. This time I don't put SL, because the EMA 5 &amp; 13 are touching the EMA50, will have a lot of spikes on prices, &amp; another thing, today is Friday... Anyhow, my TP set is 2.0347... if doesn't look good, might close earlier at BE or small loss or small profit... will keep monitor till go to bed...

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Just remember chaps losses are just part of this game - try and cut them short is my advice

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Yesterday, I should stay away from the market... not much happenning on my trade (G/CHF), &amp; very bad that I fall asleep with my trade still floating (on red -50), then the market ended.... Hope the day start on my favour (the worst case scenario, I will lose 50pips). &amp; I hope nobody followed my entry yesterday...

--- 帖子 #761 ---
I need to filter more bad entries. Does anyone have good idea? ---------------------After some back testing----------------------- When COG is heading the same way (up for long/down for short), the chance of winning is better than other set ups (opposite direction and Flat). Setting stop at the top/bottom of wave would be good one. (I'll only risk 3% of my capital, so lot size will vary) I'm still working on Exit strategy. I'm using RSI (10) etc. In the long run. I believe we'll be profitable. I'll forward test with my live account in the next week. It won't be many chances to trade compared to the original method. Give me suggestions.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
You lost me. How can that be the worst case scenario? What prevents Gbp/Chf from gapping? Cheers, Pfeffer

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hey you guys check out EMA 7 or 8 open.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Care to elaborate Sf0d?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
It probably won't work live now that I think of, but I'll tell you. I've only so far looked at shorts, so open u data window and when you get a sell signal. Look at the values, EMA 8 is more then 2 higher then EMA 13, sell. I think after a little bit the MA will stop moving and you will be able to know where it is, but this does not require the COG indicator rules. I'll post later(before open I promise) a indicator that allows you to put the type of EMA it is(close open) and it also allows you to pick the different types of arrows. What I'm getting to is if you have a EMA 8 open cross signal with EMA 5 close + you get the indicator having it for EMA 5 + 13 on the same spot there's the huge drop.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hey sf0d I'm not sure I completely understood what you were saying, but you have to realise that MA values cannot predict anything about anything - especially since they're lagging. The system here is built on two assumptions: One should place trades when the trend changes in the direction of the new trend as indicated by a particular MA cross, and you put the odds even more in your favour by taking trades in overbought/oversold conditions as indicated by the (here) COG indicator. You may try and filter and enhance and stipulate the relative values of other MAs and such, but you'd need a huge data material to investigate whether the crosses are better from sharp movements or from gentle roll-overs, which is what I suspect you're trying to determine with the differences in values between various MA settings you mention. I think you can enhance this system, but probably not from adding more of the same stuff. The philosophy is clear enough as it is now. However, I'd love to be proven wrong! Cheers, Pfeffer

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I found this thread interesting since I trade an MA system, I don't use any other indicator, just a 7 period WMA and a 7 period SMA cross, as a rule I only trade the EUR/USD but lately I have been looking at other pairs that show promise. There is a link to a spreadsheet in my journal if you are interested in the results of my system. There is an error in the January sheet, I had an extra cell linked and it skewed the total..... January should read as 189 positive pips.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
The reasoning behind my system is that price has momentum, and I try to exploit that.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
i am new in these thread. i have some confusion. i should go long or short that candle which is after moving average crossover .Does it matter candle should thouch green line . Could anybody say by picture.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
perhaps you could show a chart of what you are asking about......

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Impressive results in your journal John nice work

--- 帖子 #772 ---
I like the look of this thank you and have just downloaded Metatrader from ODL but still cannot find the COG? nor do I have it on any of my other trading software. I've downloaded the .exe. file but how do I import it to MetaTrader or is there a better way of doing this or running metaTrader. Thanks, Nigel Eyre.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
nigel right click on start (if you have windows) click on explore, scroll down to program files and click it, scroll to you metatrader platform, from there open experts, then indicators, install the exe file there. Close your platform, re-open it and it should work. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hello All, Gotta closed my GBP/CHF earlier (luckily) with -70pips... And I didn't dare to go for Long on that pair this afternoon, even though the setup is there (because it is just crossing opposite the EMA50). The pair goes bullish all the way now... but I do not dare to go Long yet... I went Short on EUR/USD... Setup for Sell was there... Sell at price 1.4737 &amp; 1.4730. Good Luck... T.A.Y.O.R.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I went short also this morning on the eru/usd at 1.4706. It looks like the usd/jpy is setting up for a long now from what I see. Any comments?

Can some one show me in detail how to install Cog indicator on to my mt4,I can't seems find it on the indicator list,where do I look for it,PLEASE.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
I would appreciate how could install the cog indicator on the mt4.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
I need install cog indicator to try enroute system can you help?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Actually you really don't need the COG.... just trade the MAs.....

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Here is the indicator if that is what you want.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
I saw EUR/CHF 1Hr TF still have valid setup for Short. EMA still crossed Down &amp; the price (the candle) still above the Top Green. I went short at 1.6115. Good Luck &amp; T.A.Y.O.R.

a little contribution for the multi chart users. You can increase your chart speed by 1.going to tools in tool bar 2. then options 3. then charts 4.then reduce max bars in history and chart Great little addition, your charts will run much smoother. Good Trading. -Ian

Hi Ian, Thanks a lot I thought of going to buy a new computer. That's save me a lot of money if this improve my pc speed. Pete.

I have to close this trade with RED (-30pips)

--- 帖子 #790 ---
try trailing your entry with a SL......... Also use a longer TF...... And get rid of the COG, it really doesn't make your trades any more reliable.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi, I switched my profile to a different one and when i switched back my COG indie wasn't working, from that moment on. Have redownloaded the indie will try that. Here's a pic of what is happening, any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
It is still reliable... the trade which I closed just now, came back to the entry price... &amp; still going down. Only me that too afraid to lose... The setup was there, entry was good, &amp; I should have stayed in the trade. So, just now, I shorted again at 1.6108. Good Luck to me...

--- 帖子 #793 ---
That's normal on the first time you use this COG. You can just scroll back to the earlier time (scroll to the left), then you will get back the normal chart....

--- 帖子 #794 ---
EURUSD was the best looking one today so I went short a couple of times and getting some small pips here and there. I have one bad trade and lost -23. I re-enter short again. Always use pending order. you will get better entry.

Both trades (EUR/USD &amp; EUR/CHF) hit SL with -35pips each.... total -70pips Stop trade by now....

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hector this has alredy been explained a few times in the thread but here are the instructions: 1 - Find the COG indicator on the first page of this thread. 2 - Click on it and select "save"- ou need to save it into your MT4 platform indicators folder...To do this follow step 3 3- When it asks where you want to save it select "My computer" then "hard drive" then find "program files" in there you will find yout MT4 platform folder - mine is "interbank fx"- double click on the folder. 4 - In your MT4 folder double click on the folder "experts" and then open the folder called "indicators" 5 - This is the folder you need to save the COG in it should have all your indicators so once you are in here click "Save" 6 - Close your MT4 platform and re open it - the COG will be in the custom indicators list. Hope this helps.

Hi Ian, Thanks for the tip. What number would you recommend to reduce the history to? Cheers

--- 帖子 #799 ---
i did interesting study recently, and general conclusion from thisnis that all ema and ma are beter appliad on logarythmical charts, rather than regular one. in this case succes rate is 1/3 higher.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
What is a logarythmical chart&gt;? Cheers

--- 帖子 #801 ---
There are linear and logarithmic chart displays I think the default on most platforms is logarithmic. The below paste is from..... http://www.incrediblecharts.com/tech...trendlines.php Log or Normal Scale? There has been much debate on the Chart Forum over the years as to whether trendlines should be drawn on log scale or normal scale charts. The case for log scale has been summarized by Alsoran as: Brokers and analysts chart in log mode. They advise institutional clients whose order flow has a marked impact on price action and trend. Their advice is heavily influenced by breaks and refusals of price at key trendlines and channels. These are based on logarithmic charts. Logarithmic trendlines are, therefore, more important. The case for normal scale (linear) trendlines: Most trading authors use linear charts: Stan Weinstein, Alexander Elder, Chris Tate and Daryl Guppy. It is questionable whether most analysts and brokers use log scale charts. Many trading authors (including Stan Weinstein and Chris Tate) are former analysts or brokers and use linear charts. In my opinion the two sides are talking about different time frames! Normal Scale Normal scale charts compare price against time. You would graph the speed of a car in a similar manner: distance (y) over time (x). If a car travels at a constant velocity, the graph will be a straight line. If stopped, the line will be horizontal. If accelerating, the graph will show a curve. Log Scale Log charts are not designed to measure velocity, they measure acceleration: the rate of growth in stock prices. A constant velocity will be depicted as a flattening curve; a constant rate of growth (acceleration) will be depicted as a straight line. Short Term In the short/medium term we focus on velocity: "Is this week's price increase as good as last week?" The time period is too short to be concerned with compound growth rates. Long Term Most institutions hold stocks for the long-term and do not concern themselves with short-term fluctuations. They want to know the annual compound growth rate; a very different concept from short-term velocity. What Chart Scale Should I Use? On short-term and medium-term charts (3 years or less) we recommend that you use normal scale. For long-term charts (more than 3 years), use either normal scale (linear) or log charts, but be aware of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Personally, I prefer to draw trendlines on linear charts unless we are looking at a 10 or 20 year time period.

I took UJ trade today and made 58 pips. I went down more than I expected but 58 pips from 1 trade isn't too bad. My strategy is very simple, I only trade COG is heading the same direction of my trades. Always risk only 2% of your account, I think we'll be profitable in the long run.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Hi, Pls i'm a newbie ,kindly explain what you mean by COG,how locate it on MTQ4,and also how to insert it on a chart. TKs.

Here is the tip, but please read the thread before ask some questions... This was on the same page ..

--- 帖子 #807 ---
GEEEZUUUSSSSS.... forget about the friggen COG....you really don't need it, trade the damn momentum

let see what this setup bring to me guys......

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Thank you endroute for an excellent post. Does anyone have the actual formula for the COG as I want to program it for a different system but can only find the formula for a bottom window indicator and not for the overlay on the actual chart. Any help appreciated. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
still open....wait if it break 1.0925 area.....

--- 帖子 #811 ---
close it in red.......try next time....

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I didn't see the signal. Why did you take that trade?? I set my strategy since the last week. (I was testing entry method for a couple of weeks) I made 94 pips in the last week. 100 pips! that's all I need for the week. Good Luck to us!!

--- 帖子 #813 ---
The COG recommended by Endroute ( an "original " one) ? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #814 ---
i thought i saw a cross between MAs and in COG direction so i took that short trade.....but that trade was not in the daily direction...i fought against the trend.....my mistake i think.....

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Here is a reposted EA

--- 帖子 #816 ---
A small twist on this system would be to ignore price and just trade when a cross happens above/below the Upper/Lower green line on the COG. Exit on next cross, parabolic sar change, opposite green line - which ever comes first at close of candle. Anyone care to code it?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Hi Endroute, I have been demoing this and I like this style of trading. i.e. having a place to enter and a place to close the trade and not leave it to my greed or fear. However, I have had some losing trades and wonder if I have got he stop loss right. Is it just to close the trade when the 5 ema and 13 ema crosses back and the 1hr or 4hr bar closes. With thanks Endroute for any further guidance you can give me.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
dead already?

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hi Fellow Traders... Where is everyone?!! Thank you Endroute for this thread and for sharing. I have been trying this sys on demo but so far no go . One question is: If price closes above (or below) the green line but the 2 MAs cross at or close to the middle line does that mean too late to enter? because it seems that by this time most of the move has already been made. Thnx.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
I tried this for 2 monthes, it runs pretty good on August, 19 win 4 lose, but not so good on Sep, so far 12 win 13 lose.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Hi I have read the thread , but unfortunatelly I do no understand the setup . BUY - "Bar closes bellow the bottom green line on the COG followed by the 5/13 EMA cross". I have attached a 1H chart , I see many crosses but none happened outside the green lines . I see in the chart only one candle than have closed bellow the green line (red arrow) ... so when this situation happens we are in a "stan-by" mode and wait for the cross to happen ? In this example there is only 1 entry according to the rules ? Do we need to wait for the candle to close . In the case than I am write ... how the COG acts like a filter ? If someone can post some examples it will be great Tks David

Hi guys. Here's interesting free service to create trade alerts on MA crossovers and some other technical signals. Ability to create alerts for Stocks, FOREX pairs, metals: Site: http://www.marketinout.com Trade Alerts page: http://www.marketinout.com/signals/trade_alerts.php

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Try this settings: BARS BACK - 240 M - 4 I - 0 KSTD - 1.0

--- 帖子 #824 ---
is there an audible alert that goes off when both conditions ( ie. for the COG and EMA crossing) are met?. if so could some one direct me to where l can find it.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
That's because COG is as useful as a fur coat in the middle of the sahara!! At first glance I thought this indicator was like the holy grail, but being the sceptical type, I watched it for a period of a week. COG repaints so badly that when you look at past data it looks perfect, but you try making any kind of trading decision and you'll be throwing your money away!! Don't believe me, just watch it for half an hour on the one minute chart and you'll see! I followed the rules in the original post, waited for a close above the very outer line (one the 1hr chart), waited for the 5/13 ema cross, took my short, it went down - for about 50pips and then reversed and started going up again, and up, and up, and up!! Luckily it was only a demo account (it stands to reason, but to those that are shorting intelligence (boom, boom), never test a new indicator on a live account!) For those that are happy to take 50pips after waiting 3 days, you go right ahead and use COG for all your entries/exits!! No wonder endroute "migrated to other approaches over time", I would assume he learnt from his mistakes! Don't waste you time or money with Centre of Gravity indicator! NOTE: I'm not knocking the 5/13 ema cross, just use some other indicator to confirm the cross, NOT the COG

--- 帖子 #826 ---
It is a good system, even though it is forgotten, but I believe there are many traders that trades it just without much noise. Would be interesting to hear Endroute`s foughts...

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Just reading through this thread today. Where have been all these months not to have seen this? Simple set up, beautiful COG. Looks highly profitable. Thank you endroute for sharing this with us.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
It is posible to trade profitably without waiting til the cross of ema`s but simply when prise closes below/abow the 5 ema. It will give earlear enty, and it will not wipsow the trades very mush. Sure I am just adapting it to my taste a little bit..

--- 帖子 #829 ---
How are you people making profit with this systme? I have tried it but could not make good profit with it. The fact that COG repaint does not encourage reliance on it. Perhaps some peoplemay wish to reveal how many pips made using this systme. Thank you all.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Actually I have this system on 4H eur.usd chart, and had one sucsesful trade. Few things what I add/changed to this is that I enter after price leave the gold or at least green line and then begin go back and when closing price cross 5 ema I enter. And only trade with the longer trend. So now I wouldn`t take any longs even there were a setup. But it doesen`t mean that it can`t be traded as well. Just trend is my frend and I don`t fight it anymore.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Back testing and live I've found this is very very accurate. I thank you for sharing this as it is my most important tool so far to make sense of the market large scale and is indispensable for planning exits. Especially when coupled with trading on pin bars. (Although the MA system is more accurate than the pins more often or not! LoL.) This also really helps you filter out bad pins. I have one question, I am curious why the 5 and 13 EMAs, why did you ultimately choose those two and why do they seem to have such uncanny accuracy?

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I do not think that Endroute trades this right like it is writen in the first post. For sucsesful trading there is no big need for any special things to guide you, more simple more profitable

--- 帖子 #833 ---
ım trying to get it but i have ques marks in my mind.on the other hand it seems well.i had better experiment cog indi a bit more

--- 帖子 #834 ---
hi it is well known that in each time, there a different period of moving average that show the market behavior the best way, and this ma will look like a trend-line in a trendy market. the problem is that the period of the moving average has to be cange from time to time. does anybody know an indicator that chages the period according to the market behavior? for example, when the ATR is high, the ma period will be smaller when the ATR is low , the ma period will be bigger

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I can see that this thread has been dead for a little while now, I'm curious if there is anyone else out there who is using or testing this method? I have started to paper trade it (picking the signals out live though, as back testing isn't accurate due to COG repainting) and it has proven extremely profitable so far, although its still early days. I have had 10 signals so far, and of those 10, 8 have been profitable. The 2 losses have been below 30 pips and the wins have been between +50 and +120. If anybody is working on this method and would like to compare data let me know.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi, Its a nice job you are doing. So did you paper trade further? If so, what were the results? By the way, which time frame and pair are you paper trading on? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Hi caj1986, I'm glad you have kicked this thread back off, I was reading the whole thread last night. I think it sounds very promosing. I have setup my charts in mt4 according to endroute original instructions. I work full-time in australia, i will only be able to trade from 1 hr after london open till usa open. I will post my charts. I hope we can learn from each other. Thanks Pheonix

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I didn't do too much testing through August as market conditions are generally poor and I was away on holiday for a lot of it. I will keep you both updated when I resume testing throughout September. Regarding the first question, I'm using the hourly time frame on all of the major currency pairings.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Some people said that indicators used by the system repaints, but I think there is an update from it to avoid this problem. But anyway it is interesting method.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
It does repaint, yes. For those who recently said it looks very profitable don't be fooled by what you see on back testing. As someone else said, just watch a chart on the 1m time frame for a while and you can see how much it repaints and that on it's own the indicator is no use. Remember to try this on demo only, and for a good period of time to see how it really works.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
The concept is interesting, no doubt. But, because the indicator repaints, you may develop a trading system based on it, but that cannot be backtested effectively, only forward testing can give true results (demo or real). And if there's a non-repainting version of it, it is definitely not going to be the same, as the original indicator "is supposed" to repaint based on last n number of bars to show the latest center of gravity for those bars. But, even the repainting version, can be used as a guidance of direction, for any trades you are willing to initiate using other indicators/techniques.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
I really don't know much about the implications caused by the number of bars plotted and the repaint effect. I have recorded somewhere a version of this sys that promises not to repaint. I'll try to find and post here and do some testing.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Is there any chance I am lucky and someone has the COG Indicator used for this system for Tradestation? As opposed to MT4, Tradestation Indicators are written in "Easylanguage". Thanks,

--- 帖子 #844 ---
As I said, I found out the version of no repaint COG MT4 that promisses no repaint. Make a test and please post here. Actually I have no time to test it. Enjoy...

--- 帖子 #845 ---
This is my kind of system. Wish I could test with Forex Tester 2 though. But COG indicator would need to be recoded for that. However Im Manually trading with moving average crosses alone in the simulator. Using 1 mini lot for every thousand in the account, and so far the account doubled in less than 1 month! Without the COG! Will continue testing....

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi Flava, Nice to know you are trading well even just with MA crosses! For better understanding understanding, can you elaborate on the basics of your strategy, like timeframe, pair, SL/TP, which kind of MA cross etc.? This will help further develop the COG strategy being discussed here.. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #847 ---
MA crosses alone are not enough. They can be used as a basis for entry but need additional support.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hey endroute, Quick question- you still using it? i would love to learn it if you still making pips with it. I don't need any expert advise. Cheers

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Hi everyone, I read this thread from the very beginning till the very end. Feel like reading a story.. =) Harrison

--- 帖子 #850 ---
You are backtesting a COG that calculates itself on recent data, so when you should have put those positions at the market the COG did not look like that. Watch it live, its meaningless when its not live. Try it on M1 or something just to see how it changes (takes longer to see on H1). There is another COG that works another way, it functions more like an envelope thingie.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Thanks for sharing your great method! I use 5 to 20 days for the MA and keep it simple - long when price crosses to above MA from below - short when price crosses to below MA from above For EMA% = 2/(#days + 1) bark it twice

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Can somone please comment on my entry?

--- 帖子 #853 ---
should I wait for bar close to enter

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi Everybody. Just tried this COG indi but with original setting. By adding the Support and Resistant line , I discovered that the price really respect the S n R along with the COG itself. Although there are alot of discussion about the COG repaint but the SNR did not. IMHO it isn't a good idea if we keep on changing /adding indi in our chart but ignore the important ones. Just sharing.. Have a nice trading.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Hello everyone...and thanks, EndRoute for sharing this method. I've read through this thread, but not every post, so if the following question has already been answered, please feel free to let me know. I have found that a 5/13 ema cross usually happens once price has already come back through the outer green COG and sometimes already back to the blue middle line. Am I right in assuming that a "proper" MA cross can only be validated once the bar closes? If so, I have found that most of the ema crosses are validated a little bit late into the move. Is there a way to enter earlier and reduce the necessary SL needed? Please see this picture as an example of my question: http://screencast.com/t/cBObRUb20wQ Thank you for your time, NeoRio

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Hi Neo, I too have been looking at this system and like its potential. As this thread has effectively died and is not being maintained - i feel that discussions on finding an earlier entry are justified. Firstly I am in the process of testing whether using this sytem with renko bars would be preferrable. I expect it would make it easier to pick reversals early and trade price back towards the center line. There is another thread in which someone uses Cog and combines it with pivots/fibs. We could look for a candlestick reversal pattern at pivots + green line - which i am sure would be effective in getting in early. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...113602&amp;page=10 Another method i will test this weekend is to use Divergence's Flag Trading The Trend entry - which is basically wait until the bar where CCI goes beyond 50+/- and trade the next bar as it breaks the hi/lo. the reason this may work is that the entry is a little later than a lot of entries - but not as late as an MA cross. Due to being late it filters out a number of false entries. Anyway - this is something i am interested in testing so let me know if you come up with anything that is highly effective and I will let you know how my own testing goes. cheers

--- 帖子 #857 ---
What is COG? How to set up COG like the graphic presented?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
CoG stands for Centre of Gravity. Have a look at the first few pages of this thread for indy and settings.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Just wanted to post an update regarding the tests i indicated i was going to make. I have found a commercial cog that i prefer. Obviously i can't indicate what it is - but i look for a price spike at an extreme price level - followed by two lower highs(in uptrend)/higher lows (in downtrend) - as long as price hasn't retraced too far towards the center and there are no pivot lines between price and the center - i will enter for a quick 1/2R on most of my position and let the rest of it run and exit at a ma cross. As i am aiming for 1/2R on most of my position - my hit rate is very high - and trailing a portion of the position increases my actual R/R rate to closer to 1:1.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
[quote=Sarythsaya;5220868]Hi Neo, Hey there, Sary...great to hear back from someone on this thread...I thought it had completely died out. Please let us know how your tests with Renko bars are going. Nice ideas. I recently tried slapping the ALF indicator on charts and turned off the MA cross. I've used the ALF on smaller TFs, but it seems to be very similar to the 5/13 MA cross as well...even a little earlier. I still am no happy with the entry places, because on the H1, the cross will usually happen late. I'm starting to think that either dropping to the M30 or M15 (after an H1 candle closes above the COG), might be the most effective way to get in the position before it's too late. Either that, or just take an MA (or ALF) cross before the candle actually closes...and just take a chance on the initial cross hoping the candle will close as a successful cross. Of course using Pivots, Fibs and RNs is something I do with most of my trading anyways, so I've slapped those on my chart...and candlestick formations are great too...but on the H1, if you wait for those things to confirm, you usually miss most of the move. Best Regards ...and Merry Christmas to all, NeoRio

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Instead of using the EMA's I'd go down to a 4 times lower time frame and look for a trendline break. An additional advantage would be you can work with smaller stop losses too. IMHO the COG only serves as a trend direction filter while everyone should know a trend is established and in progress as long as we can identify higher highs and higher lows and vice versa. In case of an uptrend, as soon as we see a lower high and consecutively a lower low, there's a big chance we're dealing with a trend reversal.... Therefore working with a smaller timeframe combined with a trendline break would give far better entries. Happy Trading, Cheers Peter a.k.a. Dutchie

--- 帖子 #862 ---
I wanted to read this entire thread. Getting late, Must have sleep. Didn't want to loose it. Subscribing now. I trade a system that throws a lot of fake cross overs. All I really want to test is, will the COG point out a few of these fakes? I seem to believe it will. I'm only 10 pages in. Will start again in the morning. LOL

hello everybody. i'm very interested in that method. does anybody have experience on the 5Min timeframe or even on 1Min (using the orange lines instead of the green?? the point is i have only about 3-4 hours per day to trade. mostly from around 8GMT to 11GMT. are there enough possible trades on the 1H timeframe? i don't wanna sit and wait without having any trade for 4 hours i was even thinking about using lots of pairs to encrease numbers of possible trades. what do you think? wich pairs work with this method? thank you! mex

Couldn't resist this holy grail type of system: trading MA crossovers while avoiding the bad ones using this almost magical indicator called Center of Gravity... Just shorted AUD/USD .

--- 帖子 #866 ---
http://charts.mql5.com/2/664/audusd-...al-markets.png i think it wasn't good short maybe this indi gives confidence but it's trading shadows not seeing bigger picture MA cross it's lagging indi so you enter when half of move is over and simple fractal should told you break of downtrend you have HL and even HH before your trade so would be obvious if you be more focus on the price

WOW! This a real shame that this system and its viewers couldn't carry this thread for another 1044 pages! Why might I be saying this you say, well its because enroute, who I do not know from Adam to apples has a great system here! I've been trading it for the last month with great success. I will attach my charts and how I am trading this system in hopes to re-ignite people to trade this system routinely. I use a whole # indicator for areas to trade up to/down to or to stay out of a trade. I take the daily average indicator to set my take profit areas not going for 100's of pips at a time only the average of that pair. I trade multi-time frame using the 4hr as my trend direction and 1 hr as my entries. As he mentioned before only taking trades that have come out of the green bands and closed and then entering long/short once the 5/13 ema crosses and closes. I have added only those 2 extra indicators to help me make my decisions. You do need to have some experience in trend lines and formations to make this work it isn't all 123 and then take the trade unfortunately. Well ill post my charts and then trades next week to show my entries.

Attached is a 4hr for trend and then 1 hour for entry, youll see the bands on the 4 hr were up and then the 1 hour had pulled out of the bands for a buy, waiting for the cross on the 1 hour and then entering long, will see if this one plays out there not all winners. I would have wanted the 4 hr bands to be pointed upwards not rolling over this could be a stoploss trade.

Hello traders You are often talking about how to see if a MA crossover is valid or not. I use two indicators to filter out the bad from the good ones. The MTF Dashboard indicator shows the SMA on the other time frames and the TrendStrength RSI MTF shows the RSI in the moment on your trading time frame. Look at the charts right lower corner. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now when you see a crossover as the rules says...check the RSI....if it´s over 50 you go north and under 50 you go south. If it´s below 28 there may be a reversal coming and if it´s above 68 the same will maybe happening. When you see a crossover also can look at the MTF Dashboard to see if 2 or more timeframes show the same on the SMA200 If there is 2 or more green timeframes...you go North If there is 2 or more red timeframes....you go South Hope this will help.

I've experimented it beforehand, however, the result isn't promising. The losses were far too troubling as opposed to the winners. The only attribute that is consistently performing above par over time would be the COG indicator, in and of itself as it's a leading indicator implying the directions of the market in a precise manner. However, there are definite rules to follow, as to which part of the system can be enhance to further develop a series of consistent winners. MA in my honest opinion is not a wise addition either, however, please do visit this thread: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=993524 . They are using MA in a unique yet effective manner.
