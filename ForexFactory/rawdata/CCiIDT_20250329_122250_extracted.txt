!!!UPDATE!!! Topic Closed Learn from your failures - and don't trade Live till your master of your mind. I have blown my Live account - as many other traders - Teh system proved to be fine, but I am failing mentally to follow my own rules. I am not gonna update the thread, to make others get to the same shit as I am now. Lucky that money was already my profit from aprevious account, so I am actualy at 0% now - but that was enough, I am gonna start over again.... Once.... *********************************************************************************************************************** Dear Traders, Let me introduce you the secret behind the Divergences that I am almost sure you have not seen before. Let me add, that this discussion/trading system is mostly for those who basically understand the CCi itself and the divergences. For a fast reference, let me attach a picture and a short description of the "generally" known divergences. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think the picture is telling you everything you need to know for your basic tradings. But what you are about to see below is a very special way of understanding the divergences. I would say, they are great indications for resistance or support levels. And these indications are coming sometimes 20 candles before, so you have time to setup your entry. Let me show you an example of a basic Divergence setup, then I'll show you the "behind the scenes" part. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So here you can see a great fall after a strong up movement, the divergence clearly indicates the down movement. As a home work, I am intrested how would you trade this? When would be your entry. (Leave a comment later on with the title 1# example, and of course you can draw your entry) So, I showed you how is it looks like based on the big book. Now let me show you something else. This little example holds 2 more things for us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So this one shows us a hidden bullish divergence that realy gave another pusing to the price. It went up as it should. (I am also intrested what would be your entry for this long?, leave a comment just as for the 1st example if you wish) So, We can say that both divergences worked as they should. But let me now show you, something, that I believe is the real reason of that "fall". Attached Image (click to enlarge) So basically I have just expanded the trend line of the hidden divergence and when the price broke it, the short trade got into action. The main Idea is now in a few words, extend the divergence. Entries: Long: Divergence set on "tops/peaks" both on chart and indicator Short: Divergence set on "bottoms/lows" both on chart and indicator In the next posts I am gonna add some screens about these setups so they can be examined. The main Idea behond this thread is to find together the best way of trading this method. At the moment what I do is as a SL I am using the last Peak or Bottom for my trades. The TP is a bit hard to describe, but I'll show it on my screenshots. Stay with me if you are intrested.

So to make a good view for your self on the divergences, I recommend: - CCi period 14 or 50, mode Close - Price with Line Graph - Or with EMA 1 Simple mode Close and use the candles with a less visible set up so they are not disturbing your eyes. To count and set up TP and SL: Use the Fibo tool Value 0 SL Value 100 Entry Values 200 TP So like this its easy to measure the 1:1 ratio for your entries. Most of the times its better then that! So as the TP. I am trying to set the TP as follows. - Take the period between the first point of your divergence until your entry, and based on the move you want to make, check what was the lowest or the highest point and measure it. That values will be your TP. It works perfectly on our example below: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I just want to show how the 14 period looks like as well. I usually check both for more signals. The best is when you get the same signal on both. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The 14th period makes more signals, but sometimes these moves are not that strong. I found small signals more effective on the 50th period then a strong on the 14th. So its good to check both.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I Will post some examples of these trades: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here comes a long a longer term trade. Which payed off very well: We got a signal, and a support level, many many candles before. All we had to do is jsut wait till it breaks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Let's see the same situation on the 14th period: (Much closer Entry) TP/SL is based on the Period 50 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Tools, Good material. I subscribe. It´s possible for you to show me in the attached chart how you draw the divergence lines to find an entry point, thank you.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks for the share. So to confirm, you say enter when price broke it? Broke it and closed to confirm the break was real? Or break it by a few pips which in this case your line graph doesn't show and it also wouldn't show it after the fact if price broke, you entered and then it reversed on the same candle (this is when it wouldn't show as a break on the line chart)? jt

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Interesting thread and examples. Looking at divergence in hindsight is great but trading it on the right hand side of the chart may prove a bit more difficult. Awaiting your insight on how this works on real time charts.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
A not so powerful move, but TP with 10 pips. Measured the highest point from the entry and took it as the TP. I am expecting much better moves, but it was a calm period. Edit: Sorry I forgot to mention that the TL was set for the 14th period, I've forgot to change it back for the screenshot. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hello! I have tried to make it for you, somehow your CCi is a bit strange for me, looks as smoothed. Mabye because of the timeframe or by the pair itself. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Actually, Closing under it is the best, but you when you are near to enter a trade, you can go down to lower time frames and make decisions by your own stategy as well and maybe enter when it just brokes the TL. I am recommending this strategy as an extra for your own trading style. This topic is meant to be a discussion as well how could we improve this way of trading, what can we add to make better TP's and smaller SLs. Good to have you onboard =)

2 bad news for the EUR - CCi new it before - TP is small due to the current way of TP I am using. But the movement is impressive. You can ignore the lower Blue TL. I used it for other reasons, the TL drawn on the CCi is the upper TL on the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Good work Tools: I use divergences but i use Rsi-8 for 1h and 5m chart. Rsi-8 is similar to CCI-14. Regards.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Beautiful USDJPY - pattern - I have missed it cause My Teamviewer is disconnecting all the time, I could just print it from my workPC - that is why sorry about the quality Attached Image EDIT: Please ignore the Fibo, I have just moved it... makes no sense at all =)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
OFFTOPIC Question - Anyone knows a good alternative instead of Teamviewer? I am afraid a firewall or a proxy here at my workplace might make it disconnect or something.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hello Jaquemate, I have not used RSI that much, but Its also great for Div. tradings. Have you checked if this method is useable?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
The GBPUSD played out pretty well Attached Image

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hy again could you please explain what kind of signal did you used by this position. I can't see any divergence.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
To do that you need 2 time frames - one for direction, one for entry

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi, It seems my teamviewer got frozen totally, I can't zoom onto this picture, Let me make it in paint to show. So basically we had a bearish divergence that could not hold and got broken. After that the price was rising Attached Image

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thank's I need moor fantasy to see that - it is impossible for me

--- 帖子 #30 ---
There is a bearish divergence by GBP now

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Can you post, a screenshot? I have totally lost the connectivity with my PC :S So As long as I am here at work I can post or check things. If you want me to have a look on it just post it here please =)

--- 帖子 #32 ---
of course

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks! Basically yes that is a bearish diver. If it breaks your TL, we can expect a long run. Of course we can expect a re-test of that TL and having another fall from there. I would trade the long once that gets broken. However the TL on the CCi is close to be flat, so it requires probably more time and movement to pass it trough. I think we can expect some down movement but I see no entry for short. (according to my setup) Thanks for the post =)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Can I ask what it the time of your Broker? Cause I was wondering why you can't see the same diver. as I do. And if you compare your chart with mine the CCi has diff, details. Is it in mode: Close? Mine is GTM +0:00 I am wondering about your answer

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I had only noticed the divergence. I would not trade it because for me it is against the trend and that is not my trading style.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
GTM +3.00 - Insta Forex, standart - not "close", it is "typical price"

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Oh! I see now, Please set to "Close" - cause that is good for the line graph. Thanks for the feedback =)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Ja, if it is on "close" there isn't divergence, you have right, sorry for the misunderstanding

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Tools... Am I looking that this chart correctly? We have a down trend overall and I am looking for bearish divergence so I will be trading with the trend. Is this a better tactic rather than just to trade any divergence? In this case we see regular bearish divergence on both 50 and 14 CCI. Have I pulled then fib correctly and have I marked the entry point correctly?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thank you for reply. It was typical price HLC/3 but now i changed to close. H4 NzdChf. Keep going the good work

--- 帖子 #41 ---
In Post 17 you show a 1hr GU chart, what I don't see is any divergence on the chart. Can you please explain that chart. Thanks

--- 帖子 #42 ---
See Post 28

--- 帖子 #43 ---
EU H1 -- The CCI 50 and 14 are showing a bullish divergence (I think, if I read correctly). I am demoing it. Any thoughts? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Morning =) I have just got back infront of a PC! So as I see there is plenty to answer. So, On your screen shot. There is much more to see and not just that Divergence. I don't want to draw all right now on it. But for sure I can see many smaller but very good signals. Please try to break it down into a closure view and markl the divers. I'll try to put some more examples to make it easier to see them for everyone.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Sorry, My bad on that post that I forgot to draw it on the chart. Let me correct it for you. The Red one is the Divergence that refers to the blue TL. The green on is another good signal that I could not see my self as well =) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi! On the 14th period of CCi I can't confirm the Divergence, but on the 50th period it is. Actualy those two bottoms are pretty far away from eachother. As that is a bullish diver, we can expect some up move now. Let me post a chart.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
So on the EURUSD - All I can see as a signal are the following. Long if Green broken Short if orange is broken I'll look for potential signals.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I think we gonna have some movement on the GU Soon. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Looks like interesting method. Would like to know more . Live trading examples may be a good option. Good luck on your thread

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Have no worries, I am trying to make as much as I can. If you are intrested in the topic, you can Demo itand share as well =) Thanks for reading!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Great... I have lost connection to my home PC.. again... If anyone knows a better alternative then the Teamviewer which is working efficently, please let me know. If you see any potential signals, share the chart and I can check!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I have managed to get a MT4 onto my mobile, its good but have no trend lines :S If my Eyes are not faking me, on the M30 we have a buy signal. If we extend a TL on the CCi. We will see if that holds the price or makes it fly. We will have news shortly.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
*Update* - Bad news for the euro - possible resistance on CCi. I'll try to post some charts from my mobile. Let's keep on waiting what happens

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi, Tools, congratulations, very thoughtful insight! I have few suggestions, though, do you know that RSI was actually created not for oversold/overbought conditions as many traders think, but actually to measure divergence with the price? It is built that way that it shows a longer trend over a period of bars, and when the speed of the price slows down, the indicator starts to show divergence with the price even as it goes with the trend. Not many understood at what moment the price is only slowing and when the price is changing the direction. You got it right. The other suggestion is - there is an indicator somewhere in FF called TDI - Trader's Dynamic Index, it is based on RSI, but somehow improved. I checked it against CCI - using the default settings. It shows the divergencies much better than CCI, the trendline that has to be broken before entering the trend is much more accurate with TDI, (CCI not always has it), so my suggestion is check this indi during weekend. Otherwise, wonderful, insightful, useful trend. Thanks, and good trading, Lietuve

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thank you so much for your comments! I know the TDI, I used it recently but not with this technique. Once I get home and kick the sh*t out of if I will check it. I realy liked it once I used it for some price action experiments. I'll have a look on the RSI as well then. I'll have a lot time for it this weekend =) Your thoughs are much appreciated! Best Regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thank you Sony/Android/Ms paint! Attached Image (click to enlarge) *Update* - If we close above the TL we go long.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Entered Long, TP is aprox. 15-20 pips - Fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #58 ---
15pips reached, got to BE. Closed 0.09 out of 0.1 - Left 0.01 there. We will see if it makes the 20 pip Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Victory! - 20 expected pips reached. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Edit: Just to Add, this mobile platform is not even that bad

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Divergence is mighty powerful IF used properly

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Totally Agreeing! (EURUSD made +20 since my trade closed =) )

You are my hero! I'll check these once I get home! MUCH APPRECIATED!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I am intrested in this "Cyprus effect" - I wanted to get some triggers where the price will move, so I decided to check a lower time frame. I went down to M15, which I am not usualy doing. And I found a signal for Short. I have missed it already passed. And I would not take that small time frame, but it might be good later on to see if it worths staying in a trade or better to close it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'll try to post some lower time frame charts next week as well. Maybe we will get out of something from these. Like confirmation of a higher TF signal. Or an earlier entry for a Higher TF signal. If anyone of you readers are following up or making demo trades based on this technique, plase share your charts. Thank you

--- 帖子 #65 ---
So I've taken a look on the M15 and made more checks. Its very intresting. It gives a lot of signals, but things are changing so fast. Now there was a long signal that got broken strongly. However this is very hard to trade and to decide where to turn to. I am not recommending lower time frames! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
So the EURUSD H1 looks much clearer. I think there is some support for us in or decision. So according to the picture. The 1st signal was a bearish Divergence. It has started and then turned back Then we got the 2nd signal which is "our signal" for short. According to that. and for the 1st signal for the bearish movement, we could have entered short at that point. When we got or 3rd signal, which is a bullish signal. We already had on our CCi the 1st signals trend line, which indicates our trigger for long, of course wen the CCi goes above it. So here its a guidiance for to go long at the arrow. So in a few words, we should not trade the regular and hidden divergences, but use them to confirm our signals that were drawn up many candles before. I'll try to get more examples for this once I get home. It could be a good way for us to be 200% sure of our trades. Hope this helps =)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks for you reply. I am a bit confused. Do we go about looking for a divergence by "lining" up the top's and bottom's of the CCI(s)? Do you use 14 and 50 CCI simultaneously or do you trust one more than the other in certain time frames? It looks like the divergence analysis I was suggesting played out to be bullish indeed. I might have to subscribe to this thread

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I think there are some additional divergences, is that correct? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #69 ---
The red one I am not sure but about the green definately! Good one =)!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello! =) I hope I can give you a correct answer. So I am searching for longs when connecting tops onchart and CCi and same for shorts but with bottoms. I am checking mostly the 14th, but the 50th as well when I need confirmation or can't see anything on the 14th. =)

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Traders, I am attaching a chart of the NZDUSD pair. I scrolled back a little just to see how things were in the past. I tried to mark it with colours what I think to be a good signal. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I hope it helps understanding the way I see these. I am trying to make some more stuff for you guys to help understanding these signals. I'll be back shortly =)

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Subscribed to this thread. Thanks toolz for this approach. Cci trendline break based on divergence. Is it your own finding ? Edit have you tried with classic OHLC candles to find divergences, instead of using close price only ? That would void some divergences you spot, cuz in my opinion you spot too much of them (last screenshot) ? What's the reason behind the use of line chart - close price ? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hello all traders who are following this thread, This is an very interesting strategy that Tools was started, thanks for that, I will show some charts how to trade this with a line chart and barchart and how to look at this strategy, it took me a few hours to study and analyze but now I think I got it I will post 3 times behind eachother First I will show you a chart in the gbp/chf 4 hr, with negative divergence on the CCI 14,

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You can also enable Ms terminal server on your home machine ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
2nd post Now look at how we can draw vertical trendlines on the peaks

--- 帖子 #76 ---
3rd post , change from line chart to barchart. we have negative divergence on RSi so we expect a short position. Now draw trendline from the lows and see that the candle break the trendline.. open a short position at the low + spread. try this and you will win 8out of 10 times regards Dutchsignals

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Idea TP1 at 1:1 TP2 at reverse cross of CCI on the TL. SL would be either at the HH, either at 2xATR(20).

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi! Thanks for subscribing! Yes, this was my own Idea. I was working a lot with the CCi and wanted to develope it as I was not satisfied with the original way of the divergences. And I was drawing alot and alot. Then got to a point where something was started and I wanted to understand what is the cause of so many good signals with the CCi. And I realized that I was watching the Divergences in the same way as others, but if you open your eyes, you will realize what is behind of it. I have never read about these findigs... yet!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Good Idea, I'll try but not sure about teh company firewall :S

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Let me help with this approach. I have something that you wil llike. See attached Its basically a CCI with candle sticks. With integrated Divergence watching. Actualy it works fine and I've used it alot. But the reason of why I've ended up with the closed CCi and line chart is that, pshychologically it helps me a lot. Less information helps to make better decisions. If this helps you guys to trade, I am glad to share it.

Hi Tools Still trying to figure out this CCI indy you posted. I see in the the input tab there is only a setting for one cci value which is has a default setting of 14. What I am not understanding is all of the other lines that look like different cci lines in the window at the bottom of the chart. I see the divergence lines and what appear to be the candles within the cci, but there are many more lines I don't understand. Can you explain if you have some time.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello =) Basically the CCi Indi is very simple. The lines you see, are the CCi lines in the following settings: High, Open, Close, Low. So you have 4 CCi's in one place. What I ususally do, going to the colours tab and making their colour to "none". So they are not confusing me. The candles are like real candles so the high of the candle is the CCi High, close ouf the candle is the mode: close. Should you need more details, let me know =)

Hi all: I was reading some post and any mate talked about enter 2 positions per trade and closed first to 1:1 and leave second untill an oposite divergence is hapens. Well. In my humble opinion if you do it first you must to know two things. First time we must to know winner %. For a 1:1 to first position you must have at least 60% winning rate. I say at least. For second position you must to know if when this situation happens, what is the average winner pips in a given period. This gives you a global stadistical about success or not success of this mm aproximation. I hope my english dont limit what i want to show. Regards.

Thank you for your thoughts. Its good to see you are intrested and its worths considering what you say. I have not made stats actually yet. The fact is, 95% of these TL breakes are causing big moves. Some small volumed trades might fail but we will see in the future how can we improve or filter these. Share your trades based on your idea please =)

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trend up to resume... (I think)...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Tools: This is mypersonal hindsight about how do you do for manage a trade based in adivergence. First 1h chart shows you an EURUSD divergence. Point marked with number 1 is the entryzone. You can do two things. #1. Enter at new bar open. Stop loss about higher high. Say 20 pips…. OR... #2. Go to lower time frame. Open a 5m chart and do the same that you are doing at 1hchart. Well. You have the zone entry. Now you look for entries at 5m chart with a tight stop loss. At 5m chart attached you can see point 1 market. From this point look for divergences and trades with a tight stop loss. In the chart I marked two entries with an average stop about 10-12 pips per entry. But what is the reward?... For me the most important thing of a system is not the entry. Is how to manage every trade looking for the maximal r:r. If you have a good r:r the winning % is not so important. For the trade im showing a good r:r could be close half position to 1:3 and leave rest open until trend gives you signals of reversal. In this trade this two positions gives you easily +72 pips with first half position accumulated for an average risk of 24 pips in both trades. Will continuing open the another half position in both trades with an accumulated +400 pips until now. First position r:r. 1:3 Second position r:r (unrealized profit): 1:20. Average r:r. 1:11. I hope everyone can understand that I want to explain. Regards. P.D. Best divergences are in oversould and overbought zones.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Very Well Understood! Thank you for sharing! Personally I'll try to use this way, I am intrested what will come out. Its basically up to me how can I take a longer term trade. But it is very intresting. Lower TF-s are realy a good idea, maybe you get a entry for exit earlier or a re-enrty point to keep the trade. Good to have you here!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I agree! I have missed this a re-entry could have been done after bouncing back from the TL. But the signal was good. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Tools: Only a quest. I see you have several sell positions. Are you going to lower tf? or you have another type of filter. Regards.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi! I use only what you see on my charts, nothing more as yet. On Lower TF, there are many signals, that hard to trade as some are not so strong and has only shorter moves. I am not recommending going lower than 1H, however if you like scalping, try M15 or M5 - with thight spreads it might be good. As I see the GU got 2x lower as I expected. Maybe I should have left 1 of my trades open. I entered into more shorts cause when the news came out the price got down already, I felt that it will bounce back and as the price moved up I entered short again and again with small lots. so as the price went down I had better and better positions. I am planning to make more trades at the same time and leave some for longer. I have a very very intresting way of doing TP-s. However it was not used for this method as yet cause these signals only 70% of them reaches realy those targets. So mainly good for seeing possible resistance points. I'll put a upload a picture once I get back to My PC. Its a very very intresting measurement. You will see =) Cheers

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Iim trying to focus on hidden divergences (they look more solid to me - on M5) Let's see. Interesting triple divergence on AUDUSD M5 in 25 minutes.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Tools. Im not a scalper. Usually i leave trades open for days. Im agree with you about go to lower time frames. Its not easy. You must practice for a time to master it. At lower time frame its better only take divergences about or below oversould/overbought zones 70/30. Hoewer i give to divergences other different meaning that you. For you divergence itself is a point entry with a predefined r:r. For me divergence is a valid signal of a potential trend reversal. If a divergence occurs agreee with main weekly trend it is a good zone for go to lower time frame and take all posible trades with a tight stop loss and unlimited potential profit. One of most difficult question is when to exit. There is no only one solution for this question. #1. Exit when a counter trend divergence occurs. Little signal of possible trend reversal (few pips x trade but more winning rate). #2. Exit when a 1h bar close above/below previous down/up bar against main trend. Little signal of possible trend reversal (more pips x trade but less winning rate). #3. Exit when a 4h bar close above/below previous down/up bar against main trend. Enought signal of possible trend reversal (more pips x trade but less winning trade). #4. Exit when a Daily bar close above/below previous down/up bar against main trend. Its for medium/long term traders looking for +1000 pips. (unlimited potential profit x trade but less than 30% winning rate). #5. Exit when trend indicator gives you a signal (i dont like this but traders love indicators). #6. Exit when Daily bar close about/below Ichimoku against main trend. For short term traders. #7. Exit when......... etc.etc.etc. All depends the type of trader and what are you looking for. Regards.

Thank you for your comment. And I am totally loving it! I'll try to back test these things, as I agree that a divergence is usually for trend reversal. I am gonna make some statistics and report =)

How to set good resistance points: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do the following. Go the Chart: MH or WK Draw a fibo from the last TOP Highest and Lowest point. (Measure the last swing) Set the values of the Fibo as: 0.1, 0.2 .... 0,9.1.0 and name them as 0,10,20....90,100 Then check where your price is. Like between 50% and 60% Now measure the 50-60 distance and draw the same fibo. Just rename the values as 1,2,3,4....9,10. Here you have a Fibo marked from 0-100 marked at every percent. Which means, you can see how the price reacts to the last swing. Like on my attache picture on a lower TF. You can see how the price reacted. Make your choice, is it showing something useful?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi tools, can you show trackrecord using your divergence break methodology ?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi! Actualy,, I don't have a realy good one, cause I am working on some different stuffs as wel, like that Fibo thing, and I am slo checking these divergences with the MACD. Which is working pretty well also, just needs some fine tuning. If you wish I'll make a demo acc just for this so we can track it. Due to the holidays, I am n ot expecting much until next week. From there I'll start one and se how things will come out.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Happy Easter to everyone =) Today brought me two great suprises. At first, I woke up and looked outside and guess what I saw? Snowing..... The other one, I did not expect to have any signals for today, but had one and took it. My TP was the last top, which was hit perfectly. I have set up the Fibo values as stated before and saw that its near to the 30% so I did not expected much more movement, however the price reached the 35% which is great! As you can see I am using the 25th period on the CCi, I am experimenting with different periods as well. The 14 gives much signals, the 50 pretty less but powerful moves, Then I changed to 25 which seems to be pretty good. I've made a long back testing and it performed well. Today I took two trades on a small real account, deposit 20$. with these two trades its not 30$ so managed to make 50% on it. in together 46 pips, and it could have been much more but I am realy happy about the results. I'll post more trades as I get time to watch the market. Happy holdays to all. Cheers

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Tools: This is another divergence example. We have a 1h chart divergence and we can do two things: #1: Take the trade selling at confluence with fibo level. Stop loss 18-20 pips. Target1 54-60 pips. When reached move rest to BE and leave run. #2. Go to lower tf an take all possible trades agree with divergence direction. Regards.

Another great signal on the cable. CCi knew it all before. Note: I have been watching the cable closely recently and found that it performs better on the 25th and 50th period of CCi. Hope someone uses it =) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

About the USDJPY which is gonna be intresting according to the news that will come I am sharing the current view, I have made 3 charts with all the CCI periods I am whatcing, you can decide which fits the most this pair. I would stay with atleast with the 25th period, the 14th is very active. But the 50th fits great as well. I'll try to post the same charts somewhere before the news. I hope I'll be awake. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have made the same triage on H4 Intresting how the diff periods predict the same signals. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What to expect from the EURUSD If the blue gets broken Long if the orange short. Its important that the price has to break one of the marked Fibo levels. IF any of those keeps the price, TP can be the next rounded Fibo number. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

HOLY SH*T - CCCi had this signal, but to have that strong up movement, I never thought this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Period 25 and 14 could predict the outcome.

Hi, I was expecting the same, and made some shorts scalps on it. But that Support line looked pretty though. I decided to close my trades, Still made some good pips. But I did not wanted to say there in short for the NFP. I wanted to see the results before stepping in. And these Lines were not broken to continue the short. I have took a deeper look and decided to go Long. till 1.3000. I told to my self, if both trend lines gets broken I'll short back. It was not needed at the end the two TL's kept the price and blown up. However, they are still good resistance lines. Maybe they'll be get broken later... Edit:Forget to add the Chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) +16+10+4=30pips

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Another possibility to enter the trade is to trade the divergence in the conventional direction. But I'm under the impression that this usually generates less pips than the anticipated TL-break. Example: enter long @ green line cross (last peak before or after divergence): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe we can always anter the trade this way: price either breaks the TL or it breaks last peak / trough. Not sure though if it's worth it because it often seems to reverse fairly quickly to break TL afterall. So maybe just wait for the TL break and miss out on some trades. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi, The idea sounds intresting, during the weekend I'll check how it performs and see if it worths using or adapting it. Thank you for the constructive Idea! I hope your are doing some great pips =) Have a nice weekend and its good to have you on board!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
You have a great weekend too! Tomorrow I have to party all day. But sunday I'll try to look into it some more too. The only thing I'm affraid of is that this extra entry will complicate this clean and simple method. Because it combines conventional divergence trading with your "counter" divergence method. I want to exclude the indecision when the entry is there. Wait for counter or go with conventional.... Anyway, it requires more research. Maybe it's just checking out existing divergence trading methods and see if we can and want to combine them into a if-then method. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi, I was checking about the effectiveness of what you showed, and maybe its just because I am realy focusing on the divergences use of my way I feel them not that safe or long term as the original way. If you have time to Demo it, please do so, I am intrested of what you get out of it. Maybe these requires a higher period on the CCi to be stronger. Enjoy your weekend =) Waiting for Monday!

Thought I share my Demo acc, started on the 4th of April with tracing purposes. Its been started with 100$ its now +30%. My Live acc, started with 20$ is now 56$.

Hey Tools, Nice progress there! I think I read it somewhere in this thread before but just to be sure: you ignore the highs and lows? So you basically base your divergence on the chart on the closes. Correct? I ask this because everywhere else they teach divergence trading they do it based upon highs/lows. This also goes for divergence indicators. But if I think about it makes no sense because oscillators are based on closes (by default).

Hello, Tools Been following your thread as I stumbled by mistake upon it. Good trades, excellent point of view. Glad to see you sharing your knowledge with others. I read all your posts, but maybe I'm missing something... could you please tell me (all of those that are watching the thread) how would you trade the break in the image I posted please? Just curious if I am missing something .... Thanks in advance for answering my question. Keep up the good work! Cheers

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi, Sorry for the late answer! I draw all the trades I could see on this chart, hoepfully that helps to see more. That special trade would be a SL I believe, but right after it there is a good TP trade. Let me know if you have qusetions =)

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thanks for your input Tools! I thought so. Anyway, could you please say (I have read the entire thread but do not recall), how 'happy' are you with this system? I have been trading something very similar for a while now and it's been almost the only system I am comfortable with. Any other indicators to filter the bad trades a little? Cheers,

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi! Personally I am well satisfied with the idea of the system, about its effectiveness I have no doubts. But about my effectiveness and personal judgement, I am not that satisfied. I need to improve my decision making to get a better trader, but I am happy with the system. I am silent recently as the topic got no real attention and I realy thought that maybe I'll find some help here to get it better. So if you need any help or have any Ideas I am happy to help =)

People use different indicator for the Divergence and hidden divergence, why is the reason that you do not use MACD, Momentum, or Stochastic? first time i see people using CCI for the Divergence, very interesting

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello, I actualy started using it because of a inspiration. I saw and read through a great great topic started by forexcube, its the TASAYC - I leared so much from it and that where I realy met the CCi. Since that I can't live without it I realy realy like it. I have tried to develope the use of it and that is how I got here to this topic. =) I tried those indicators as well, however The CCi is the closest for my style. =)

Aha I thought you had the trade based on the lower divergence. Excuse the RSI 8, used that for ages. I also use a higher low or lower high following divergence as the confirmation for entry. See arrow up, in this case same area as TL break. Added 8 sma onto the CCI and the cross also roughly same area as TL break. Its a moving TL. Have a look if you like.

Hi Tools, some MM advise for your system please?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Well I do not recommend the one I do So what I would say, be safe, do not risk much with this system you can reach with one move in a short term +10 pips for sure and the avrage is +30/+40 is you keep it. Its an avrage as it does sometimes much more and less as well. Based on your deposit, its better to risk about 1 - 3% of it, cause it gives much signals. So even with 1% you can be good if you have time to trade. On the majors I am sure there is about 4-6 entries per day. I am not good in these advices but I can recommend a topic where you can learn good MM. Its the TASAYC system. You want to be a master, there you go =) I am still reading the topic by time to time. Just hard to keep it in mind during trades, which is my bad.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hello Tools, can you tell me how you determine it is a Divergence signal or Hidden Divergence Signal? please look at the picture that i attached, #1. is regular divergence Signal, i did trade for it and lost, how to avoid the mistake like this? or i just wrong? #2. is Hidden Divergence Signal, is that possible that divergence signal and hidden divergence happen in the same time? if it does, how we going to determine? thank you

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi I have corrected the chart a bit how the TL's should have been drawn. Sometimes a Divergence looks pretty long on the chart, but there might be smaller signals. There is that is an SL trade. but the others marked are profitable. I can advise to use the 14 the 25 and also the 50 CCi. If you see a signal on atleast two of them, you can be sure about the signal. If that helps filtering the trades. If the chart does not help, please read the 1st post. If you will have questions, let me know, I am glad to help.

Today's trades -2 - I was in short before the news for Germany, it went down but when the news came out I had to close the trade. There was a strong TL as well and I did not wanted to stay in it. I was waiting to get a lower high or a new HH to go long, but the H4 has formed a nice bearish divergence and as I had my Lower High I went to short. +40 - I have closed the trade as a bullish divergence appeared. But of course its a god sing to go short if that gets broken. I am not gonna trade it at night, so we will see how it goes. I am happy woth the day. =) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What a nice suprise for me, I just got back from a birthday party, I have left the Gold for Long and got home for a TP, it took some time but perfectly where I wanted. So the trade was decided as the two resistance points "1" and "2" were broken trhough with strong moves and the next expected area was the "3". It took loner cause there was some stopping after the long "jump" but It has reached the entry point of the resistance level. The resistance level is actualy based on the candle sticks.

GBPUSD H1 I have a baaad feeling about this Whact for TL breaks, somehow I smell short, but we will see if it breaks the support Trend Line, There is a very big resistance that it has to break to go realy up. But thats also a great distance. We will see, news day for the GBPUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) The blue line represents a current divergence which can be removed if the price can make a new high, of course with a candle that closed higher hen the last top.

Now I am not gonna get back for that 10 pips. But the USD data was green, so I suspect that the target 1.5535 will be reached shortly or the price will get realy close to it. I consider this to be a great day. And good signs. Thats all for me today =) Have a nice afternoon traders.

Hello! Thanks for sharing Very Intresting and looks similiar. It confirms that what I found is not something that's just my imagination! =) How ever I do not recommend it as a stand alone strategy, that is why I try to use these TL's and R/S levels.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Now you are using s/r levels, very interesting. Do you draw it or are you using a tool?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hello =) Actualy I am drawing them by my self. The main tool is still the CCi, cause that is one of the greatest help to get into a trade with confidence. As I got home and see where the price gone. I am shocked. And somewhere happy. =) That I was on the top to go short when things started to fall with the help of the S/R levels, signals were made by CCi TLs and I had a clear target level. I could not keep my trades still to get there, but that is something I can improve in. But the system proven good and the best part is the general basis of it is proven to be good. As a conclusion for the day, I should have watched the CCi much more. I am gonna clear all my old signals cause it does not help me to think. The S/R levels are easily drawn based on a short post analysis on the best indicator of all times, the price. I use the candle sticks as resistance levels. Target is always the inner borders of a level and the entry towards the next level is the break of the outer borders of it. Drawing is one thing but using them. Thats a bit complicated. I draw both on tops and bottoms. Once these levels are being touched any way or reached closly I make take it as a not anymore valid level and I start drawing once from the top which touched the level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi, here are a few good tools for S/R. Personally I use the MTF_SR and SupDem, the others are also worth to look at. All are variations of fractal S/R except the II_SupDem_v2. I also use MTF trendlines (from H1 above) on chart, for this I don't have a separate indi but a built in function in my chart drawing tool. I agree, S/R levels and trendlines are very effective confirmation levels for divergences. I also attach here the well known FX5 variant CCI divergence. I modified this to use close price instead of High/Low, this has _close at the end of the filename. This is supposed to use on line chart not on bar chart. Although some filtering would be useful to reduce the high number of displayed divergences it is a useful tool to make the job easier for the eyes :-) Regards, Gyula

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Szia Gyula! Thanks for the update, I'll check them once I get home! Today I am not trading, trying to rest my mind and prepare for next week. I'll do bunch of back tests so I'll be fresh =) I'll check these indi's and see how they work. Thanks for sharing. Have a nice weekend for all/ Jó hétvégét

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi Gyula, I got home finally and had time to look on these indicators. I think for those who are intrested in the S/R ranges they are pretty good help. For the way I think of these levels unfortunately they do not fit that vision. But let me share in a comparsation how it looks like. I have invented a very intresting way of understanding the PA and the S/R levels. I realy hope I'll be able to tell it in a followable way. So Lets Begin! So first Kind of setup, We get a top with a nice candle stick, That will show us the S/R level, if the price gets into this level we have to re-draw it from there if the price fails to break it. The 2nd top that reach this level will have a candle stick which will be used as our new S/R level. The picture will explain. However, there are cases where the price is not testing this level, back. That means that is is likely that it will do when the trend changes back. Here you can take the most recent levels where the S/R was not tested and you can expect where the price will go. Picture explains. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Now Let's see how this works out with the CCi. I'll now draw the Divergences.

Evening traders, Nice to see that more people are joinging. This week was a big piece of crap, I had realy no time to do a thing :S I mostly try to do my trades during my work, but I had so much to do and could not follow the market. I could have had 2 trades today on the same signaling, but I had time only for 1, I could not see the other signal as I was away. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its great to see how the price reacts to the Trend Line and how the price retraces these levels I marked with grey

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Now I have some time, I'll do some analisys how the week looked like and what do I expect. At the momentI would say that the price will go a bit lower we will have probably a divergence and test back the top resistance level at 1.2915 If there will be no bullish divergence, we will go down again to the 1.2860 level. to touch the support again. Any of these levels might get broken, means another stong move towards the next lower or higher level.

GBPUSDD1 It think it does not require much comment, it has rejected the support level. I think we gonna have some bulls here EDIT: Gotta correct my self as I could not see the Doji at first. Attachment

Based on this raw analisys EURUSD is doing something similiar as the cable, closest resistance drawn. Short if it breaks this great support level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Took out 15 pips now, It has rejectd the last resitance level os Ithought going short for some pips, well it has reached 15pips pretty fast, but as its night time I am not risking for a few more pips, according to the rules we will go down around 1.5245 I guess. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #214 ---
probably during the night it will reach a point maybe get lower or just do a bullish divergence to go to 1.5300 again.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
So As I waited, Divergence as a bullish signal, touched the support, going up until the next resistace levels, Oh, and the GBPUSD hsa rached yesterdays's target 1.5245

EURUSD played well +26 on 2 trades Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am intrested about the GBPUSD -its stucked -

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I have closed my Buy Trades not so long ago, expecting short near to 1.52

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Shorts turned around and now going down again, I decided to close down all, waiting for a clear signal by TL breaks. Better stay low for some time. Still +20 as yet all together. So profit in hand.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I notice you changed to bar charts? Is there a reason? I do not find the line chart too good for this setup because the close values of 3 bars can shape a quite different pattern than the highs or lows. I mean the highs may form a swing high when the closes form a swing low. Regarding the role in a divergence setup - extreme highs, lows - close may be OK: when the close is considered as an extreme value the high or low is surely more extreme, therefore the setup is better. We just don't know for sure what is the situation with swing high/low.

Support on GBPUSD 1.5220

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hello! Actualy I had to change, cause these support levels I've found are unable to be drawn without the bars. So I have to live with these, however I don't like it. It has greater affecto on my emotions you know. Its not just a line that clearly shows a direction, this is something that I still have to get back used to. I think that is why sometimes I close my trades earlier then waiting. I have to get better! The system is pretty fine so I hope someone is there who does uses it or understands it enough and tries to demo it also. Thanks for being around =)

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Atleast I knew this, the fact I can't trade it is anotherthing that I have to work on =(

--- 帖子 #223 ---
To go lower on EURUSD we have to brek under the 1.2780 and we can go till 1.2715. on the GBPUSD next tartget some where at 1.5130 or if we are realy bears down ways until 1.5015

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks for the information! I've been looking to better understand divergence Edit : Just finished a quick read through, have some basic understanding of the concepts so far. Will set aside more time to really study all the posts and charts that have been shared. Once that is achieved will do some manual back testing also. Will take some time for that happen because of work. I am sorry if you already mentioned before, but if you would be so kind do answer the below questions. Response from other traders that are using/testing this method is also greatly appreciated. Q1 Do you use mainly a single time frame for this method? If yes, what is the time frame you use most for your trades? Q2 Do you use multiple time frames for this method? If yes, what are the ones you use? E.g. H1 for overall view and M5 for entry Thank you very much for your time, your responses will really go a long way in helping a newbie trader like me understand

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hello cfdtalenong, Good to have you here! Let me know if you have any other questions, I am happy to answer =) Maybe sometimes with delay due to my work as well but I am not forgetting anyone! So for Q1 - I use mainly H1 - no lower cause its dangerous, Above any other TF fits even Weekly. Its good to have a higher level view when checking the Daily chart as well. Q2: I am not mixing up with things as you may see a different shapes and divergences on Lower TF's and that can ruin your confidence. Only trade what you see on your main TF. If you want Multiple TFs, better make decision on a Higher TF and trade ONLY according to that in the lower, never againts with counter trades. I'll try to post some charts from tomorrow again. Have a nice day to all!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thank you Tools! A little guidance go a long way in learning

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi, I support the idea of MTF divergences, as you mentioned, mainly on and above H1. This can be a very powerful pattern, especially when they are embedding, confirming each other. In my chart (developed by me) I use divergences of several indicators, and display them on the current TF and many above, I remember 3 or 5. Divergences are filtered by several different criterias so it will not flood my chart. For example there was one great pattern on GBPUSD H1, H4, D1. As you can see on the attached H1 chart: There appeared a daily regular (reversal) divergence, with a H4 reg .div within this. Then the beginning reversal was confirmed with two following H1 hidden (continuation) divergence. This all happened in a strong H1, H4 support area with even weekly SR level (small red circles at 1.5200). During the last H1 hidden div. the price finally broke above weekly support and H1 trendline and shooted nearly 80 pips to test H4 TL. (There are the II_supdem and MTF_SR on the charts.) I mentioned filtering. Divergences can be filtered quite good based on how the pattern is forming. Generally on the indicator with looking where are the 2 points and what happens between them. Where are the points: usually this is above/below overbought, oversold levels - one point in itself or the relation of the points, for example if the 1st point was overbought then the second must be under overbought level. What happens between the points: usually this is crossing 0 (zero) or middle line of the indicator, or looking how much movement there was between the points, mainly retracement percent. I added the filtering of Alexander Elder's "Missing Right Shoulder" patter too. It is only a short description, the parameters vary and I still work on finetuning. These are hard to identify with naked eyes in real time, I would not try without my program. But even smaller filterings will result in finding better divergences.

Hello, Thank you for your thoughts, I was also intrested in MTF, as I mentioned in my first post I've learned much from forexcube the author of the TASAYC system he used to talk about these much. I am happy that we have pretty good thoughts here. I am intrested in your progress. Please share more, I'll keep an eye on you and Intrested what you find and your trades. I am having emotional problems So I want to stay on my way now, but that does not means ignorance on others, so I ask you please stay and show more, I am sure we will have a nice crowd who will soon start to speak and not just watch and we can built up more here!

Shorted GBPUSD + 25 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Todays biggest lesson, follow your rules, I have tried to go longon EUR USD as I did not waited for a candle to close and I have entreed in a spike for long, I had to close it with -20 minus when it turned around, but after realising that my signal is still valid for short I have entered as much as I could when the priced reached higher and higher. I managed to close it pretty good. After a big loss I managed to get back 1,5x of it. so still in plus. My mistake was, I should have not used a high lot as that to hedge it down, and I should have waited for the candle closed. I am happy I could save out the situation and wait for it to clear. Conclusion, patients, no lot changing to higher values! I've closed these trades as I wanted to get calm again to have a clear view of what is realy going on. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not a bad day by the way. In terms of pips: +45 from the morning +25 from the GBPUSD -20 and to save the position I have made new shorts with closes as: +15 +18 +22+24+13+2 = +144 So its not that bad. Even with 0.01 this would be great. Thanks for following

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Now this happens when you leave the market alone: EDIT: Wrong picture attached... New picture: Attached Image (click to enlarge) In the post #200 I have introduced what it means when a top or a buttom does not gets retested... It gets retested. We had a shorter term bearish movement, and now we had a even shorter term bullish movement, which has retsted the only un-touched top we had in the past. It has rejected the price and since that we are falling. Support for EURUSD is at 1.2860 And the best is now we have a big stick for that bar, so what I think of, we will have a correction back to the 1.295 area sooner or later, and if that rejects it, we will fall again. I would say the lowerst wher the EURUSD can go now is 1.2770. There it will have a great support, if that fails, we will be like a rock. We will see whats gonna happen. I always miss good things By the way, the Buy I have entered as a hedge on my shorts, supposed to have the TP at the orange horizontal level... so If I would left it, it could have been from there another 24 pips, but its always easy to be good afterwards... About GBPUSD - Better to close shorts Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #242 ---
EDIT: Drawings are from H1 sorry.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
"Support for EURUSD is at 1.2860" - Target reached, and stopped the price as predicted.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
So I still have to trust in my decisions and my system, even though it prooved much... I am duch a dumbass... But I am keep on progressing. Had some pips on the Cable in the morning +9, there were not much of momentum. on the EURUSD I had +10. I had the feelign that it gonna rise, it has rejected the last resistance levels and there was a TL for bullish movement if it gets broken. I set My TP as you can see that dark blue marker next to this big bar to the buttom of the last unfilled resistance level, I knew it we are in long that is the TP, but when the price reached the TL, I had a feeling to stop here as it might stop the price. And we actualy managed to get to that level. Okay I am still happy cause I am in plus, but it could have been 4 times more.... ah.. never mind, maybe later today I'll heve better chances. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we do not get a bar close above that level, we will not rise further. We have 20 more minutes with a strong stick on the last bar currently while I am writing. If that gets broken , we are long for the whole day I belive!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
EURUSD is expected to reach - 1.2940 - Fingers crossed!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
CCi is pretty high up, can happen that we will have a Bearish divergence and push the price back down. I am expecting some consolidation or retouch of the previous low.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I have closed my trade in +10 and opened a new 0.01 trade for testing purposes, TP is 1.2940 We will see! So in together +29 by this time today, not bad but could have been more =(, but still in plus! (I had two more trade as I was too emotional during the news, but I closed them with 0 instead and waited to see the results of the news)

--- 帖子 #248 ---
So at this time, I have ended up to close my profits, I have entered in two trades, they have reached together +50 pips. I am happy about the fact that it realy went in my way after breaking that lower resistance level. The price will probably get t 1.2940, but as I'll be away, I am not risking to have a divergence that can kick my profit. So lets run! all together for today +79 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #249 ---
bravo dude divergences are important warning alert that i observe.i use stokastic beside cci.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanks MAte, I agree that divergences are great power but never can be used alone, and this is something that I just start to realize. You always need the best and most trusted indicator of all times. The chart it self. The price does not lie. Here is the current look of EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) I still believe in long, however we have now that dark blue are which has not been retested, so if we go any higher, I expect the 1.2940. We need a very strong move to go higher than that. But, If our price gets stopped at that level, we can go for short till 1.2880 This level has been touched so many times, we will see. GBPUSD Smelling short: Reasons: Resistance level is being touched soon,, preparing for a bearish divergence on the CCI, Trend line is close, we market closes, less momentum, I believe it will come down till 1.5070. We need a strong bar to hit trough the big blue area to go long. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Oh, during I was making the chart and all stuff, EUR USD hit the Target.... So thats what I've said just as the GBPUSD reached that level. We will see where the bar closes!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
On a longer term back, we have some point that were not touched yet, so we can expect a longer term bullish run? It depends on this bar I think how it will react! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I've decided to get into this cable. I have placed 3 orders, Each for one resistance levels, which were not retested yet. So I expect all of them to reach the TP.These are gonna be long term trades as the highest one is more than 110 pips away, so probably not today but hopefully tomorrow we will reach that. I am curious how is this gonna work out. we have broken with one strong candle 3 Trend lines and I belive this and the new HL means a short term trend change for the Bulls. We will see how is this gonna work out.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Just closed two trades on EJ +22+23 - with this today's pips are +124 Attached Image I started to wonder what tomorrow will bring. Better get sleeping

Some other nice pips from the EURJPY I made 3 entries +41+42+39 =122 within 1 hour. Attached Image (click to enlarge) TP was set much higher- But I want to wait out today's happenings, these pips will cover alot for my ongoing trades.

Here is the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Will we close above that level? +36 All together +158 for today.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I have closed down some GBP USD trades where I entered long when the price bounced back to the support +25+20+9 - I have 4 more trades left open, those were opened yesterday as a long term shots So I'll wait for those, Whit this step now I have backed today +212 pips. With the same lot size I use. These 4 trades have now +200 pips as a SL. So even if we would have a fall to like hell. I would be able to close today still in profit. I can close those if any strong support level breaks and I smell bears coming. This is a great day! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Have counted and made +341 on Long trades and +350 on shorts this week. Its amazing. I think this prooves much of the system. The system it self provides I believe good MM as well. Most of the entries are safe, those which may turn around can be handled by watching if there is a divergence or S/R level breach. If these levels are keeping the price, its better to hold the position to get back close to your entry, saving you potential pips or gaining profit on trades. Today had situations were the overall pip count was -110 or more. But there was no sign to close those trades, well it turned it pretty good as expected. About the GBPUSD I am a bit worried, cause there are some unfilled levels under the current price, which might get filled soon, which make me think that these trades will be taking more time then usual. I think today we will see some more moves in both ways.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Paitence pays - already +100 pips on 5 trades. If I would close it I would be so happy for the day, but I'll let it run. I have opened one when the price bounced back recently. I'll close it just to bank out somegood pips to us as a SL for the others. +37! +249 for today sofar Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
All long term trades are still there. Expecting the best. If this beauty closes like this in 14 minutes. The first target is "sure*" to be reached! *IS there any sure in FX?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Let me quote my self, so it seems our candle could not close above the resistance level. Maybe the next hours candle, but I expect another "ranging" or short. We will see!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Its all about the news, we will see where this big red bar goes, It has touched an unfilled support level. But it has 3 other on the way. Will they keep the price or let it fall? I am not closing yet.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Technically, it is short, as it could not break trough our resistance level, it could not make out. Its techncially short toll the last resistance. Which is where we are now on GBPUSD and EURUSD both were touched. It could have been traded easily, I was blinded with my long term stuff. It could have been some extra more pips! However, if these levels can keep the price, we can still expect that long, that is why I am keeping them. After this long run I will not close them just like this. We will see. I have nearly +250 for today, even if I losse 200 I am still in plus, so I am not worries, this worths the lesson. Oh, by the way, it looks like a Double Top as well, Which means we are likely to go lower. If the support fails, I am in short.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Emotions won.... I clsoed all when It went back to plus. I'll just ovserve from now. Its already a good day, I thought its better to leave it nicely. All trades in together closed with +8 So close of +257! I love this system!

Hello Tools and CCI traders! I have this weekly picture for eur/usd with CCI 55/13/7 Check - 55 I hope It will help you all !

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hello Tools! From what I see on the charts you posted, you are using divergence with supply and demand zones yes?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hello =) Sorry for the late response, just been spending my weelend away from home. So, yes that is true, these levels are so great to see where the price may go, or go-back. and CCi is perfect to indicate if that level will keep the price or will break it. I used this all week and giad much!

Now back here again, I have closed a 5 pair basket this morning, This was for testing purposes to see how the 5 pair works, but I'll stay on the 8 pair has a better view, this 5 pair is mainy of JPY, its better to trade only JPY then. -6 GBPUSD -3 NZDUSD +8 GBPJPY +8 EURJPY +8 AUDJPY +15 from this

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Tools, A little question about this method. If I understood well, for a bullish signal for example, we are first looking for a divergence between two bottoms, and then we use hidden divergence to define a trendline between two highs and we enter a long trade when that trendline is broken? Are there some rule to define the hidden divergence? Do we take most recent trend? Should one of the highs occure between the two bottoms? Do we draw any hidden divergence trendline and we enter on the breakout of any of those trendlines?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi! if you read the 1st page, I think you will have your anwsers =) Should you need more clarification, let me know and I am glad to help. Cheers

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Looking at the first page, I can guess that any hidden divergence trendline can be used (please correct me if I'm wrong).

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Actualy we are extending any divergence trendlines, both on the chart and on the indicator. Examples for Long HH on Chart LH on CCi After extending both we will enter when the CCi will break the TL put on the LHs. LH on Chart HH on Price After extending both we will enter when the Price will break the TL put on the LHs. Examples fo Short LL on Chart HL on CCi After extending both we will enter when the CCi will break the TL put on the HLs. HL on chart LL on CCi After extending both we will enter when the Price will break the TL put on the HLs. I hope this makes it clear =)

Thank you very much Tools! I understand now ;-)

Closed some trades on EURJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) +20 +15 +6 +3 -22 ******************* =+22 So basically, I have stepped in last night when the marked opened as I hoped that it will come up till the very top, but the price turned againts me. When I woke up I have seen that it has already re-tested that support line, so I have gone to long again to go till the price gets back to that top where my entry was. Sometime after my entry, the price formed a divergence so started to fell. I kept stepping in long as I believed that the support level will stop the price. It did so and reach the last lower resistance level. I had to close the trade as the CCi has another bearish divergence. For me it seems that we have now a level around 131 that has not been re-tested yet, so later on its a good target level. This day is pretty slow. Hopefully we will get some movement tomorrow. Todays profit +57 pips so far.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I have closed some fast scalps on the USDCHF - based on the Idea that it will bounce back a bit from the resistance level and a Bearish divergence drawn, I did not wanted to wait much with it, cause if it bounces back like breaking the TL we have there its a bullish sign then. I had 16 entries in together: 5+4+5+5+5+8+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7+5+10=103 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have also traded back my GBPUSD from last night closed it in +2 - However I sould have trusted more in my signal, and it could have been way much more. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Atleast the signal was perfect, Today's count +304 (same pips size everywhere.)

--- 帖子 #282 ---
may i ask why did you enter trade for eurjpy? thanks, J

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Jhfx, sure you can ask it =) So When I entered the trade there was a very strong bar, and due to the news I felt that It will break the resistance level and shoot further as it did. Its the same for the GBPJPY When I have entered it was a huge bar. After I entered I have left it cause I went to sleep. But It shoot higher as I waited. The target was the next resistance level. The GBPJPY has reached it. The EURJPY reached it so close, there were about 10 more pips to reach the goal. However I have gathered my profits earlier.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
thank you for the answer! Regards, J

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Any time, I hope I am clear =) Just in a rush today with everything.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I have closed my AUDUSD trade, its also from the night, it turned againts me pretty much, I hoped a longer move downwards, I have traded it with more entries at the very next resistance level. Attached Image (+17+19+14+14+14+3+2)-23=+60 Today's total sofar +364.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I could not save my AUDUSD short from last night, it was a hell of a bad trade, I expected it to stop at the next resistance, but it has been shot over, I did not wanted it to fly until the next one so I've closed all my shorts. There was a few, and I have a pretty big Pip loss, But today's count is still plus. That is why I tried to save these trades with others so here is the black list -72-44-44-35-24-22-6-8-6-9= -270 +364-270= +97 =) So its abig cut on today's profits, but still safer to have 100 pips in pocket than leave 10 entries in the wrong way. I am not giving up I am still in plus!

--- 帖子 #288 ---
As always its easy to be clever afterwards, but I know I wher was my mistake. From the beginning I should have traded long, till the resistance level and maybe that could have cut some part of this but that is where we are here, to learn from our mistakes. I am glad I could save out all the other trades. So here is the not usual picture. Attached Image I don't treat this as an error of the system, but mine.

I did not had much time to trade so I tried to make an all day trade. I have started a basket based on an H4. I did not draw my lines as those many sticks are so crowded, but its visible for the eye to see the price bounce back from a support level. I have closed it with 25.5 dollars, which equals to 255 pips based on 0.01 trades on 8 paris = so on 8 trades I had that plus. Attached Image (click to enlarge) No CCi was taken in the decision this time

--- 帖子 #292 ---
So Yeah, long time not posted, it seems no ones around so I stopped posting. But todays move made me to post and show some thing For those who watch GBPUSD (D1 chart) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If we close above 1.5600 with a strong candle we are likely to visit the next resistance level. EURUSD D1 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) we have to close above 1.3250 stronylg to go much more above. USDJPY H1 Attached Image Its a sample of the strategy, The divergence TL has been broken, advises to go short. On the D1 chart. its visible that there was a non re-tested area, which we managed to hit, the other one was are-tested, we might touch it, but I think we gonna stop for a while here. We need something real strong againts the dollar to go lower tomorrow, but if that happens we will fall by 300 pips more back to the beginning Attached Image Finally EJD1 - same as the UJD1 Good luck for everyone

I find it very intresting, I used to use it once but some how could not connect any more tools or thought with it, but it was very intresting to see how the price reacts to these parallel levels. Please post more if you have time. I am intrested =)

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I tried Gann Grid but pitchforks ar good for my to see the chart.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I admit it! That is true! =) Your chart is impressive! Thanks for sharing! I am gonna play a little on chart as well, maybe I'll see similiar to you. You know what I do miss right now, is that when we trend in one direction. I have bottoms or tops which does not gets retested during the trend. And I need something that can help me see how or when thee price will return towards the trend direction, before retesting the last top or bottom. LEt me show what I mean. The red boxes represent non retested tops or bottoms, green ones are the retested one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe with the pitchforks that can help. Can you look for these patterns in the price and apply your point of view with the pitchforks? I am intrested, maybe you will have something in these areas. I am looking forward to read your reply =) Thank you so much!

I feel like sharing again. Okay so on the AU D1 chart we can see some signals and levels.currently. WE are 16m from the candle closure. I am sure that the price will not bounce back aprox 80 pips to close under the support level. Which means, up movement, in a daily candle. I think we gonna have bulls for the dollar, if not then the price need to close way under 0.94 to go short for a deep deep level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

EJH1 chart. H1 candle closed where it should, possible up move till 129.3 az 50% based on closes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUD1 Well this is intresting, the candle closed or will actualy close above our resistance, which predicts a new resistance around 1.34 As the CCi shows its overbought, so some re-test down might come, so I guess we might go down tomorrow for a short time, but in longer term price has great chances to reach 1.34 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Same for the GU, Longer term, 1.58 Might retrace a bit tomorrow Attached Image (click to enlarge) We will see how these predictions will follow. Better to trade intraday. Good luck to all for this very intresting Friday

Hi Traders, I have not posted for some time now, it does not means that I am not doing anything. I am just concentrating on my Live account. In the past 5 days I have managed to raise it with 18% of the deposit, even with small trades which could have been much bette but as long as I am in 1 cent plus I am happy. My goal is to reach 10 pips per day, by this In 1 month the account can be nearly doubled. I am working on it! I thought I mighth share some recent trades on the AUDUSD - I had a feeling that we will go up. The original TP would have been at the red line, but I thought I might play for the next support level as the red line was already tested once and if this is a short up-trend we have to go above of that and then the next goal is the next support, which is the GAP and a few candles before a small "Top". Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3 trades +57 +90 +95 = +242 on one pair. I had no balls to trade on Live, but to test the system and prove it I used the Demo. Which started on 5K and now its 22K

--- 帖子 #310 ---
263 pips for a day is not bad, and the day has just started. For those who do not believe in S/R levels and CCi Divers, better to ocme here and examine some charts. With this S/R levels its possible to trade CCi divers on both ways, the wll known original and the one I found out. There are bunch of possibilities. And with these levels, its a bit hard and requires fast reaction, but its possible to trade under H1

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Nice setup on M15 for the GBPUSD - Green is the level where this short move may come back - Blue is a TP for Buys -Buy if Red on CCi gets broken If the CCi breaks below Orange, but the price remains above green =&gt; Divergence which is possible sign of Bullish movement towards Blue. Attached Image We will see

--- 帖子 #312 ---
we have 10 more minutes, but the CCi is now under the Orange level on the previous screenshot. If we close like this we are already in divergence. we have to wait for the price to turn.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Intresting, My Live Account has a different candle on the M15 - same broker. By the way, the price has touched the recent level marked with blue. Its originally the greenone on the previous chart. Its visible that there is abig gap with the closing on the first chart, that is why I set the green line higher where the close was of the blue candle. So from there with a bullish divergence I expect some up movement until the Red level on thsi chart below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #314 ---
So the M15 went deeper without reaching our target, as there was a TL brake on the CCi. Now based on the chart below which is the H1 - we have a marked support level. If that breaks then thats a signal for short till 1.56

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Based on the H1 Bullish diver I traded one more buy with the same lot size as the other trades. Attached Image I closed them in plus 16 pips GBPUSD M15 Attached Image EURUSD M15 Attached Image +29 Together +45 All for today +308 pips with same lot size. Demo Acc, now 31K - 6X of the Deposit. - Started on 21st of May.

Scalped another 6pips for the real account on USDJPY M15 bearish diver back to 94 21pips for today on the real. Its 2x what I am planning to gain per day. Already at 24% - Account started on the 5th of June which means 6 working days! If I keep on just like this in 1 month I can double this. So much small things are gathering up to alot. One man said once 10 pip is enough for happiness, I DO AGREE.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Scalped back to 94 again on UJ M5 - TP on 4 trades Attached Image +16+14+3+18 = +51 on Demo Total on Demo Acc today 95+37+51=+183 Account on 46,7K now - more then 9X of the deposit! I have started high risk trades to see how it goes. Well prety fine. No losers for some time now

--- 帖子 #321 ---
While posting my other trade and doign my job here at my workplace I missed this, There were beautiful signals! Price could not break the green box and we have a bullish divergence which is a clear sign to go back for the last TOP or atleast to stop the price and move it to the other direction. The TP could have been the Purple BOX. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Scalped USDJPY to ) 4 again -&gt; 15+11+10 and had 1 loss -10 = 26 1 loss - I was not paying enough attention Attached Image (click to enlarge) 183+26 = +209 all day While writing this I have entered for the news, and scalped +13 for the live account.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I could have had more but could not step in earlier =( It took some time on my mobile to change back to the live account. but phew still got it till the next resistance level. The resistance level kept the price, the next level was the once marked above. Now weare ranging between those. Direction? Where it breaks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Scalped another +7 on Demo -&gt; in together +216 on Demo and +34 on Real = +250 Now thats what I call good a good day. I have stepped out of the JPY rally thats on going now. Target is around 95 now. Its Riski to step back into the train now as the next stop level is far. If we get some retrace maybe. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Took another 37 pips out of the USDJPY - This means intogether of 287 taken pips for the day. My last trade was a very risky one, but worth it. I got out of 3x of my deposit from this trade. So now the Account is at 69K - almost 14X of the deposit. I am intrested how far can I push this. Its very strange to have 40lots now, where I started from 1 Lot originally. Of course these numbers are not realy relevant, but its good for testing, to see how far can this be pushed. And very nice to see all the profits. Now I have to work on to be patient and give time to trades, but as long as the real account is not getting atleast doubled I am not risking a thing =) Be good for the night. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I traded it as I awaited that the green TL will be broken but retraceed as there was a diver in place I left it there and when the new green TL broke We got to the TP.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Post 323 - Direction confirmed after closed above the marked area - Post 324 - TP almost 95 reached

Two trades from this morning Attached Image (click to enlarge) +5+16=+21

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I don't feel like as brave and wise as yesterday, probably I am glad about my profit and now afraid to lose. Iam in -6 pips today on the Live. I managed to save it to this level out of some other trades. So I am still glad I could end up with a better solution. I think I'll put away the Live acc for today, or maybe for sometime now, to clear my Mind. I have left a short open on the Demo to see where would my last trade go. If I would let the Live run as the demo it could have been +4. So Have to get my self together, not much of loss, I have lost much more just as anyone else and you can't be always a winner. But better stay focused. I am on the Demo now so I am napping. Its now 76K after another high risk trade on UJ made out 10pips. X15 of the deposit. I'll end the Demo account today. Next week I'wont be here to trade and thats the week when the Demo account will reach 1 month of life. Thats good enough to see where it has evolved. I'll try to summarize how much of Pips I made out of it. If I say that it has reached 15X of the deposit its just a number on Demo. I have just recently changed to normal or high risks. Before that I was trading with 0.01 and 0.1 just for the pips. So I guess that will make more sense to sum the pips.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Clsoing the day +14 on real with two trades - managed to take the news towards a close resistance level on M5 at 95.10 Daily target reached.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
So here we are - I have finished my last trade on the Demo Account - stareted from 5.000 - Finished with 90.167 with my last trades of 23 pips on EURJPY - I managed to reach almost 1800% of the account which was started at 21st of May. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I know this is only Demo, but with my High risk trades and as you look back how much of pips in a daily average which is likely to be high above 100pips per day. Proves that this system has something in it. You have to feel it to be real advanced, and you have to be very strong in mind to do the same on a real account. Its easy on Demo, I guess almost everyone was a billionarre once or twice =) but not on real. I am trying to keep up on Real using my daily target 10 pips. If I can double my account which will be pretty hard, I'll then use higher lots to keep up the daily 10 pips as its a very achiveable goal and by that I can double my account every month, with very low risk. In my account at the start it gave me 500 pips of "stop loss" till blowing it, which is pretty much. But I want to keep this up. However I am not gona change my lot size every day, but when the account gets doubled. So by the end I'll have 1000pips of Stoploss to use. Example. 100$ USD Account =&gt; 0.01 = 1000pips to blow on EURUSD for example 100$ USD Account =&gt; 0.02 would be my chice I would change lot size when the Account reaches: 200$ USD Account =&gt; 0.04 and so on 400$ USD Account =&gt; 0.08 800$ USD Account =&gt; 0.16 and so on. This means If we count it back. I should trade at a: 1000$ USD Account =&gt; 0.2 lot size and make -&gt; 500 pips. -&gt; Target to double in a month by 20 working days -&gt; 25 pip per day. Achiveable? I am sure yes! With my 10 pips per day, which is likely to be more every day I am close to this target, when I'll have much better confidence and strength in mind I'll raise up this target and try to trade more. I just wanted to give an Idea to every one that If you are careful about this account management and you don't want much of risk on your back its just all about counting. How it looks with big numbers? 10,000$ -&gt; 2 lot -&gt; daly target 200$ -&gt; 2% of your deposit per day - With 10 pips, with minimum risk, you can gain much more then any bank would ever give you in one year. Well that is the plan I have setup when I started my real Account on the 5th of June - Today 31,4% of profit. so in 7 trading days (4,4 percent per day) I reached this level, currently I have +130 of pips I can use as my stop loss towards my deposit, which means that it would take bunch of bad trades after another to clear it which gives me a bit of condifence and helps my trading. Sorry for the long story, but I just wanted to share my thoughts and hope that I can help you guys. I just wrote down what I made recently and what keeps the soul in me. I am sure if you are strong in mind and whatch for your account and being patient enough. I am sure you can make forex by living. And let me tell you what, from my point, the WORST! thing that a trader ever can do is to reach for always the most pips. Set up a target a daily target that you need. After that rest, and be happy, don't be angry on what you've could earn be happy on what you have. Another thing, FORGET!!! I say forget Stop Loss. Set up in your systems clear! entries and exits. (Maybe the entries sometimes a little bit late for me due to availability) but exiting a trade need by two reasons, your system indicates now a clear signal for entring towards the other direction,or getting your target. I have lost too much because of stop levels, but now I say, on thing counts, bar close. if you want to exit, wait for a candle to close. I had so much of news that I traded in Demo before going live, and had too much if sticks that hit my stop and could not take my profit. And this breaks everything, you will lose confidence in your system at the point where you see that you have lost money when you could easily won it. If you are safe with your lot sizes, you will never need to have stop loss. Personally I am always checking my S/R levels, if a candle closes out side of them I close my trade. And thats a mental SL, and that gives you condifence that yes, acording to my rules this is a point of stopping, and its not gonna be due to some crazy world wide SL hunting. Another advice is to prepare for the trade. Set your levels wher the price can go and expect the worst. So there can not be anything suprising. Okay I wrote too much, but I realy want to help as I have learned alot as well on FF from some very talented and great tradets like FXCube. And I feel I have to give back something. Thanks for reading all of this. I am gonna keep up updating the forum, and I am happy to answer questions. Good luck guys. Have a nice weekend.

hi, I'll add some explanation for the picture Attached Image So for the numbers. Point 1 - entry signal for Long towards Point 2 or 3, both fits the place of the TP as that is the most recent resistance level. Point 3 is the best place for short, as it could not break the rsistance. TP till point 4. I traded otherwise. as I knew I'll be asleep when this might happen. I already had my support level when I entered and it was pretty close so I hoped it will break lower. Why I entered short? Cause on H4 there was already a sign to go short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price has tested and untested level and there is a red candle which indicates that the price will not break and the CCi was already heading south. I closed the trade in the morning as I have already reached the primary goal and managed to go even further. On the GPBJPY ther eaws a stong pushing and a resistance level that I thought will stop the price and make it head south. - signal is visible on H4. Attached Image There was no signal clear indication to go short at that time I've entered, but as I went to sleep I could not wait for a better entry. So I stepped in where I was.

Live account at 44% of profit based on the deposit - Daily target reached 4x times with a small scalp in long on UJ. Demo is on 454K Happy pips for all

--- 帖子 #345 ---
So I tried to set up an explanation how this all could have been traded, of course it easy to speak afterwards, but listen and think of what I show. Based on the facts I've wrote in this thread. This is gonna be long but worths to read. Those blue lines are un-tested support levels from the past. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Point 1 - Not so long before the move there was an indication for a long TL which breaks means a long ride. Point 2 - indicates a bullish divergence - we could have prepared for the previous TL to get broken Point 3 - TL broke, indication for long - admit it its a very good place. Point 4 - indicates possible TP levels, here each levels break indicated that the next level is the next possible level that the price can reach. It requires some investigation for the past back so its better to draw these earlier for both directions. Point 5 - indicated a divergence so the price had to stop soon, which has happened. This means time to go short. Point 6 - Divergence indicating bullish movement - TP lets see if we get a new high, so TP is the last high's close price Point 7 - Price could not make new high, candle stick reaches resistance level, falls back like a rock. TP could have been the level around point 6 - As it was btoken, we could reach for the next level Point 8 - TL broke, confirms pint 7 signal. Point 9 - Divergence, indicating long movement point 10 - TP reached. - Going long - TP at latest support level under point 13 Poing 11 - Double bottom formed Point 12 - If this gets broken TP till point 13 or if that gets broken till point 14 Hope this helps understanding this method.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
For the haters, If course this is the strategy, but it requires YOU! to trade it. I don'tr say that I can fully trade the system, but I am reayl working on it! In Demo its okay almost on Live its a bit different. This one big picture explains everything, back test the Idea. You will see. Put me any picture with CCi 14 price closed mode and I'll show you how this workes. Have a great night.

Point 2 -Which TL do you mean to get broken, in the TL in the price or in the CCI? Point 3 So, do you trade the break of the TL in the indicator? Don´t you? Poin9 In which point where would you go long?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
HI, In point 2 - I refer to the first TL drawn. as point two indicates a bullish movement and as we had a TL already drawn in point 1 both on chart and CCi according to our rules we were waiting for the CCi TL to get broken Point 3 - we trade both TL break in CCi and on the price. Point 9 - indicates a possible up movement, going long when price reached point 10's support level. I hop this helps. =)

Trades today on USD JPY - Sorry about the trades, sp,e cpuéd have been way better. But Live trades are always fastening my hearts BPM Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1 - I set a closer TP to be sure of the profit 2 - I have gone in short, but After I set my Fibo I realized that it was a bit late, so I have closed my trade at the TP level 3 - I entered long to zhe rounded number 98,00 - I got it but I just realized later on that there was a gap which will be refilled 4 - As the gap filled in and I got a very nice signal I entered long As you see at a pretty good position, MY TP should have been the blue area, about 30 pips from my entry. Of course my mind told me to close the trade, so I did... Studpid me... But as you see, signals and TP areas were already given, you only have to trade, which I can't do so good yet, but still making nice profits. I am glad that I have reached a level now that I am brave to trade my signals, Maybe these are not the proof but will be better.

I entered there cause I was going to sleep and did not wanted to risk to leave this one out. **************** +8 on Live from two short term trades

Hi, you gonna get the charts in a few minutes. But be aware, due to time zone differences candles and of course CCI - signals as well as resistance levels (candle sticks) - will be different from your chart. Of course this also means that these measures will not be reliable, I prefer using a TF which fits all Time zones. Like H1 Best Regards

Perfect setup, double top, price broke down resitance level, triggering that the price is likely to reach the next one, Divergence -y Trend Line break -&gt; TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge) +13 pips on AUDUSD M5 - lenght of trade 3 mins.

Not impossible! We are at a strong resistance! I think és need something strong to push even lower. Next price tag of the bears = 1.2965
