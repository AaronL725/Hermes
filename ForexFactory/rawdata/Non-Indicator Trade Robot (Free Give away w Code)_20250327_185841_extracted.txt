For first time entry position, on Buy side.

It need to pass a series of condition test. Main conditions aretrading range  of last 5 bars (M15) must be larger than 400 points (40 pips) , which can be reduced in order to gain more frequent entries. In older version I use only 200 points (20 pips).you can increase the number of bar to test from 5 to any number e.g. 10, 12, 20 you can decrease the range that market need to swing before entry lower than 400 to 200 points (don't go too low you get caught in Asia trading session with low volume)  Where the market is during last 24 bars (can be change, up to your optimization). Again, this is measure from Highest High to Lowest Low of last 24 bars.24 x 15 mins = 6 hours in the last 6 hours, find where the market is and translate into percentile. "I" prefer counter trade. So try to BUY low. Assume percentile(24) is lower than 30% then I buy. "I" prefer counter trade. So try to SELL High. Assume percentile(24) is lower than 70% then I sell. Note that, in the code I use OP_BUY and OP_SELL to determine the direction to measure and I still keep the "<30" if condition.  Pls see the attached code picture along.

Older version Archivev66 v66a v66b All .ex4 files, are working fine. Running on Live account now.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
please look at my post #12

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Haha, It does nothing.

I should remove it.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
sure thing.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Great...Mine have taken two trades,one win (GN)+$3.10.And one GA who is in a huge DD right now...Look at the pic. it's like a rocket

--- 帖子 #17 ---
haha me too

-40 pips now

no sweat yet.

I admit.

it bot is sometime stupid. Still require user decision to intervene sometime.

it has some draw down.

I need to improve it. that's why I move to new build mt4 which is Object base programming. easier to write the code.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Wow! good job!

This is very similar to "milestone" Expert Advisor by Trevone.

By the way, which build of MT4 will it NOT work? Build v610 will it work?

Also when are the conditions for the robot to close trades/basket of trades which are in a loss?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
if you use only compiled .ex4 file to run EA it will work.

if you compile the code .mq4 it will not work due to new mql4 language

--- 帖子 #20 ---
try search in the code for

Inserted Code       OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove();
//BuyThenImmediateProfit();
//PositionLossAfterHrsthenClose();

--- 帖子 #21 ---
on the last line of the code, when it closes in loss after certain time has lapsed, what if there was big spike in the opposite direction?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
it will let it pass if it holds no positions, until entry condition matches.

but if you can write some algorithm to capture that and follow/reverse, also possible.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
hi dear,as you advised i used ex4 file but still i dont have any trade, can you tell me how i can add magic number sinc i dont see any on bot?

best regards

--- 帖子 #24 ---
This is the result since yesterday

--- 帖子 #25 ---
EDIT...Two more

--- 帖子 #26 ---
dear bazze, can you tell me which one do you use? mine doesnt work at all for three days.

thanks

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Can I get one of the script showing trade results history, please!!!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Here it is...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I use the last Version on the GBP pairs,and Version 66b on EUR pairs...OOTB.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Good results Bazze. Are you using the EA with out of box settings or have you made any changes?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
\

thanks, appreciate

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Very impressed!  Thank you for sharing this great EA!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thank you for the sharing.

I would love to study the strategy!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I run it OOTB,ergo no changes...... Some more pips today

--- 帖子 #35 ---
So far so good demo

--- 帖子 #36 ---
bazze,

Would you please share your indicator/script that shows a summary of the trades taken (like in the bottom part of your images). I think that's what iamgotzaa asked for here:

Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
He got the right one

Edit...Huge DD right now,let's see how this will end

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Here you got the indi,my friend

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hello

where find volum on text expl 0,10 etc...

thx for answ.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
can somebody help me to find out what is the problem with my experience on this ea? still no result after 4 days,please

many thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Can you please upload a Picture of one of Your Charts?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thank you, bazze. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
sure here is  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Persia pls use v66b.

v70c fromback test on GU it may take up to 7-10 days for a trade.

V66b yields higher trade positions.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
GBPAUD lastnight did retrace to 1/2 from here it dropped. Hope u got out.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
ok thank you for advice,i will tray and report back to you.

regards

--- 帖子 #47 ---
would you forward me the setting file you have there? I'll take a look why it is not trading.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Persia,

I rerun the back test with minor user setting change. The "Calm_range" I reduce to 200 from 400. And attached file is test result.

Note that it yield large draw down. This is why I use 400 as a default. Because in calm market or Asian trading session which normally trading around or less than 40 pips per hour. And major trading was in other market sessions which it result in significant trend bar in larger timeframe.

Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| User Define variables                                   |
//+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
extern bool UseAutoID=true;
extern int User_define_Bot_ID=1000;
extern double BudgetAllocation_Percent=10;   //unit Percent
extern double MarginOfSafety=5;

extern int UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh=60;   //Points
extern bool UseAutoCalLotSize=true;
extern double init_lot_size=0.1;
extern double  Limit_MAX_lot_size=0.5;
extern double exponent=1.44;
extern double squeeze_factor=0.3;
extern int atr_range=24;
extern int candles_range=12;
extern int Calm_candles=8;
extern int Calm_range=200; //I change from 400 to 200
//extern int D1_Candles=5;
extern int D1_atr_range=10;
extern double HoldMinutes=60;
extern int  High_Or_Low_Diff=40;

pls see test result

--- 帖子 #49 ---
After reading code, did I understand correctly this will follow FIFO rule of certain brokers right?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
no.

I also not aware of that rule.

Intention of the code is to minimize the trade number as low as possible. --> less draw down

--- 帖子 #51 ---
So far it's going the right way,but we'll see...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
thanks!!! more power to you and this EA!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
dear iamgotzza,i was using that with default setting and i didnt have any trade as i mentioned for three days, i replaced that with v66b as you said

on 8 pairs, now is working and i have a closed trade and two running trade,do you have any advice about v70c version .

best regards

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Persia,  v70c it need some time to take trade. That's all about.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hey iamgotzaa, in your opinion, which is better?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
66b is worth to run live account.

70c is promising (and under testing). If anybody want to run, I recommend 66b. because it just trade more than latest version.

BUT keep the eyes open for large draw down may occur. And manual intervention may be required.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Today one of my buy trade hit TSL, then it went "reversebuy" then it placed stop loss also. Very intelligent.

Just one question, how did it compute the SL? I think i did not see that on the code or i just missed it.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Can it be added in 66b a line where in it put SL during large drawdown as a % of previous winnings and if it above that, it will close the open trade with DD.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
stop loss on reverse is bid/ask +/- some pips (i think 10 pips or 100 points) depends on side you are on.

you could change to the highest high of last 5-10 bars using HP() or LP() function (for Lowest Low)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hello Everybody...a big question...I'v tried this two bots with fxcm version of MT4 (build625) but it doesnt work in a properly manner..it doent works at all!

Is this a 6xx buld version of the bots or...? thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thanks!!!!

To be honest also v70 i think would be safer in the long run

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hello gotzaa and all!

I did not look carefully into your source code because it is difficult for me to understand the state machine concept in a short time.

I hope I can understand it better with more studying.

But with a little demo time,I think the bot(v66b) is smart with good profit protection.

When the tickets are in profit zone,it will put a stop loss line to protect some of the profit.

The problem I have right now is the broker I use have unfair spreads for the cross pairs,for example ,I get 6.5 pips spread for EURNZD.

Do you use ThinkForex?Do they provide good spread for cross pairs?

(Is it allowed here to discuss about brokers?)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
been using the V66 on 4 currencies so far.

It has made trades mostly on GBP/CAD.

49 pips in these three days!

awesome!

thanks fellas!

the only prob is the SL is not added automatically and could be a prob when the trade turns against you. any solutions?

have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
hello,

are the settings the same with only 4 digits (eg: GPBUSD 1.6803) ?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
dear iamgotzza,i got 9 trade on two days with total profit of $12.80 so far mostly on GBP/AUD,EUR/AUD,GBP/USD. ( v66b version)

but ea doesnt show any specification on screen at all on these two pairs,do you have any suggestion for that? or should

i apply any magic number on ea if is necessary, i think this ea is a piece of art.

best regards

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Can you check if the attached files, working in latest build after correctly compiled, works as you would expect them to.

From my tests it looks like the EA does not stop when loosing.

Need more testing.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
The week ended like this Some open trades in DD,but that recovers next week

--- 帖子 #68 ---
great result,i wish you more pips,can you tell again which version exactly do you use? do you have any special setting or they are on default?

mine is v66b.

thanks

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I think it is the symbol with prefix. Need to modify the code to support it.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
i design it for 5-digit if you are running 4-digit broker. I need yo do some coding too.

and that's many place in the code need to change. Such trailing stoploss function and stop/tp offset.

anyway, i'll take note what o do. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hello

I would like try your EA on a demo

MT 4 micro account with $10k to start

Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I have run your EA on 4 digit broker for 3 days and no order opened yet.

Really appreciate if you can make it available for 4 digit broker as well.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #73 ---
sure.

What broker you are using? I'd like to register for demo account.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I'm working on the solution it depends on time, trend and opportunity to place a good SL. Anyway thank you for testing.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I think if spread is higher than the limit. The default if it is more than 6 pips spread it would not trade (and no message show)

please change the setting on the value of "UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh" variable.

Note that the number is in Points (not Pips), 60 points = 6 pips. You can set to 500 points = pips so it can always trade..

But there is backfiring here. In case of very dramatically rapid increase in speed during high impact news, I observed the spread is high more than 60 pips spread for a 1-2 minutes on ThinkForex live account and AGEA server also. Not sure if it does happen to another broker. It is two-sided blade.

Inserted Code       case state_idle:
{
//----State's action
//create range upper and lower bounds
max_gain=0;
max_loss=0;

//#spreadlock
//if spread is more than 60, this bot would do nothing.
if(SPREAD>UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh*Point)  return;

--- 帖子 #76 ---
state machine is quite simple idea to design a program into group of blocks of code.

e.g.

state=idle
"i'm waiting for signal" (checking any indicators)"if there is signal to buy, I place buy market order""if there is one buy order, I change state to 'buy1'."state=buy1
"I do trailing stoploss""if there is no order, I change state to 'idle' again"
About high spread, it would not trade if exceed 60 points (6pips). But you can set the UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh variable very high, so it can always trade.

cheers!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
thanks for your explanation, is it really matter  to use any magic number for this ea or no? please clarify.

best regards

--- 帖子 #78 ---
yes, it does matter. If two robot with same magic number, they will got confuse on the "state" they are in.

I think what will happen is that running two instance of same pair and same magic number, it would change the state=buy2. Which means it will set the TP according to the condition to recover those positions.

So I suggest changing the magic number to different number of each chart window, even the same pair.

e.g.

running GBPAUD 2 chart windows

first window, set the UseAutoID to FALSE and unique magic number.
Inserted Code extern bool UseAutoID=[b]false[/b];
extern int User_define_Bot_ID=[b]111111[/b];
Inserted Code extern bool UseAutoID=[b]false[/b];
extern int User_define_Bot_ID=[b]22222[/b];

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Can you trade all pairs on the same chart? or do you have to attach it to individual chart with diff magic numbers?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi mike,

right now, one ea entity per one chart.

of course, don't forget to change magic number.

but your idea is at the back of my head also.

thanks,

--- 帖子 #81 ---
The GBP pairs I run With Feb10v70c v1.1,and the EUR pairs I run With Feb10v66b...All default settings.I run it on a 5 digit broker,FinFx.

Thank you Iamgotzaa,....will start testing it tomorrow

--- 帖子 #85 ---
anything let me know

cheers!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hello Jamgotazaa

We are downloading on to MT4 now 5 digit

Will try it this week on  demo with small settings

How do we make contact,about results etc

Sure we will need to fine tune things

as things change in the markets all the time.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
You can message me thru the forum inbox.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Could you please provide the .ex file since the .mq4 could not be loaded on to the chart. (compiled with errors?)

Thanks

--- 帖子 #89 ---
sure

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you,but can you please make a zip-file instead,can't open it as this...

--- 帖子 #91 ---
hi there, does any one know how to change the magic number?

what option is it under?

is it under user define bot id?

thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hey iamgotzaa,

I have to say that this is one super awesome EA that you gave to us. First, I'd like to thank you immensely for finding it in your heart to give us this EA. I do have a little problem though. I tried to backtest the Febv66ba on EURJPY (I was doing that with the Feb10v66b and it was working well). It didnt place any trades. When I checked the journal tab, it said I was running it on a 3 digit broker server. I suppose that was the reason why it did not place any trades. But when I try any 5 digit pair (EURUSD, EURAUD, GBPUSD ...), it worked well.

Please tell me, what can I do to remedy this? You can look into this problem and possibly solve it for me.

Thanks in advance buddy.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes saticdoor86. Thats the magic number. But you have to set the AutoID to false first or the manual magic number wont work.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
alright, done. thank you. will update you on results soon.

thanks.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I noticed one thing though, that once I reduce the calm_range from 400 to 200 in the Feb10v70c (just as in the Frb10v66b/ba), the trading frequency increases. And it places trades as frequently as the earlier versions.

But it will start having the same huge DD like those ones too. Is there any way to control the DD to not exceed 10%?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank you Iamgotzaa

--- 帖子 #97 ---
here is the .zip file

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I saw the first week live results on your blog! Nice work!Will this updated version work on build 610? Or just 625?I currently have the 70c version on live for test this week

--- 帖子 #99 ---
hi Patmontes,

mt4 version625

I use 66b running live. 70c is on demo.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thank you,my friend

Three trades closed last night with the new version,three winners,+$17.92...GBP pairs,default settings...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi All, what is your advise on how to use the EA in the upcoming non farm payrolls?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
cross finger...

I prepare extra algorithm against the high-impact news also. fresh baked

so it should be a good time to test

heeehee

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Bravo!!

what time zone you're in?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
On some pairs there are error message: "Spread is too high=0 (limit=0.0006)".

Any advise please

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #105 ---
If you check in the settings, the UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh = 60 (Points). You might wanna check the spread for the pair you are trying to use the EA on. If it exceeds 60 points (6 pips), then you should increase the UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh to something above the spread of your pair. If your pair is at 9 pips, then set the value to something more than 90 and so on.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
haha! Nice!!! which version does this exist?

I like the meme!!!

by the way... closed profits on some trades a few mins ago using v70c

Also, how much budget do you need/recommend per pair if we set init lot size to 0.01?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hello and thanks to all fellows especially to iamgotzaa for sharing this great EA.

I just started to test the V66b and I chose only GBPCAD for now cause i check it on a mini live account and it entered a sell position in 1.85662.

I would like to know if anyone else has this position too?

Thanks again. ​

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Thank you Odomike. I have changed the "UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh" as per your advise and it works.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Guys,

I tried this ea just for the heck of it. I did not change any settings or whatever and it gave me 5 losing trades and 1 winning trade....

I was just looking at my charts while the trades was executed that ea placed a sell order on those 5 losing trades while the break out is happening on the upside....kinda weird...what is happening????

--- 帖子 #110 ---
You are welcome belka

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Thats really weird. I have run series of back tests on several pairs with 90% modeling quality and there was no instance in which the EA gave me 5 loosing trades. At most, there will be 2 which it counters with higher volume winning trades. Currently I am running it live on EURJPY and it just picked the current Highest High for a sell trade on the 15M TF. Currently in profit but still running and it also just opened a new sell trade on the Highest High of the EURAUD too. And that one is just going into profit too.

You might wanna check things like spread and also what broker are you trading with? I am on Tradesway FYI.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
EURJPY sell trade just closed with 11 pips profit. So far so good

--- 帖子 #113 ---
some drawdown now on EUR NZD and GBP NZD using v70c. sudden long spike

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Iamgotzaa,

I have been running the v66ba with 24 pairs since this morning. So far, some pairs are going positive and some negative. I just wonder when the Trailing Stop starts for the positive pairs and when the recovery action kick in for pairs going negative.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Odomike,

Do you think I did something wrong? What do you think happened? Or maybe the robot don't like me  By the way, I am using Oanda demo mt4 platform. What do you think should i tweak in your ea settings so that I can also experience the same performance executed by your ea in your trades.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Just tried the 66ba on GU 15minute, and it placed a buy when market took off short! ?????

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi Renegade,

It happened to me during london open breakout. I was testing the ea if it can be used during london open however ea placed trades in the opposite direction of what is happening during the first hour of london open and it cost me around 100 pips as a loss.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
just noticed the same thing with my broker. Trade opened against the direction of the trend??? something wrong here or have we not set it up correctly, one other short trade taken with GBPUSD was also against the long trend during london open????????

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I agree with you. Hmmmm I am confused as to what is happening. I lost 5 trades opened by this ea simultaneously

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I'm also using Oanda Demo MT4 (5k Demo) and haven't had any problems like 5 losers in a row (closed that is), that is odd.  I've only had the 1 small .80 loss with EURUSD, but with that news last night, I got all these open losers ATM.  I'm running the 66b ver with default settings.   Here is a screen shot of my current open and closed trades.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I really like the foundation of this ea. I think if we can get it taking trades in the proper direction, it has a lot of potential.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
GMT+1

--- 帖子 #123 ---
first please try to find out best setting by your own. some time spread is the issue with onda so best try different broker or workout your own settings.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I started with the default settings and will modify after watching it run for a few weeks.  I want to see it in action for more than a few trades.  I've only had it running since last Thursday. Thanks for the suggestion.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Iam, in post 79 you show how to change the magic number.  Can you tell me which line in the code that appears?  I couldn't spot it.  Also to make this easier could you put the magic number in the user defined box so that it can be easily altered when bringing the EA into play.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Everyone, please read post 12 on the first page. You can modify the number of bars to test do ensure a nice entry and the range the bars must meet before the EA takes a trade. And also... that's why v70c would be safer in cases such as yesterday...

but not all is lost... trust there is a recovery mode the EA goes into... and it works!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Acey2424, you might wanna try and re-install the EA with the appropriate settings provided by imgotzaa. Did you put the 3 .mql files in the library? And you now that the same files have to go into the Experts folder for the 66ba version, but make sure that you download the correct version of the library files that came with the 66ba if you want to use that. I am using the 66b version though. Well, in my experience, it has not really placed any trades in the wrong direction. It has successfully picked the Highs and placed the trades in the correct direction too.

By the way, it has placed 6 trades in my live account with only one loosing. Making a reasonable profit so far. So, my advice is that you should try and re-install the EA following the correct instructions by imgotzaa.

Just FYI, I am using an ECN account from Tradersway, but I think that any account from any broker should be able to handle this. I do recommend using ECN accounts though cos of the very low spreads. You will profit more with such account types.

Oh and by the way, this is not my EA. I am here just like you. The EA was developed by imgotzaa and the sole right and copyright belongs to him. I am just helping because I thought it will be nice of me to help others whenever I can.

Cheerio

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Yes by reducing the calm_range (in version 70c), the EA will place more trades, but could result to large DDs sometimes, but it generally always recovers it with counter trades with larger volume.

If you want EA to be more conservative, increase the calm_range.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Why is it that people don't take time to read through the posts and they just start asking questions that have already been answered. I already answered this in post #94

Just to explain this again,

Set AutoID to False and
type in any integer in the User_Define_Bot_ID (For instance ... 1234)

That should give the EA a unique magic number. And make sure that you give a manual Magic Number if you want to use EA on more than one pair on same terminal.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Yes that was what I meant. Increase the calm range and also increase the bars to test. I think what happened yesterday was the bars being tested were going in one direction, then the EA placed the trade in that direction thinking that will be the trend because the bars being tested showed that. But then suddenly price went the opposite direction... and every trade got caught opposite.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Gotzaa and all helping members.

I have one question and few comments.

Question : I went thought the code and cannot figure out how the trailing stop loss is trig-erred.  It seems to have a variation from one pair to the next as I can be up 20 pips on one pair without the trailing engaging ... while up 10 pips on another pair and the trailing engages.  All charts have different Magic numbers to avoid any conflicts in trade management.

General Comment : I notice some members do not read the whole tread before making comments or asking questions.  This is a "counter trend strategy" based on statistics of price action ... so its normal that the trade may often go against the actual trend that you see on the chart.  So please take the time to read the entire thread to avoid wasting other members' time and benefit yourselves from the whole picture presented.

The real issue with this EA is more the "Martingale" recovery approach that is taken with Gotzaa's algorithm.  Martingale is and has always been a plan for draining your account eventually.  But in this case, with proper MM (money management) and not being too greedy with lots of 1 rather then of 0.1, it seems possible on a long term basis to gets some profits.  For example, with a $10,000 account, 0.01 lots transactions can work.  If tempted to trade 1 lot, your account will bust eventually.  Just back test it and it is clearly a plan for disaster.  There will be some scenarios where the trend is so strong for an extended period of time ... and your account will be drained.

Comment for Gotzaa : You are very smart buddy.  Thanks for sharing your algorithm and asking us to participate in the fine tuning.  If you need help eventually in coding in .mql the final version or some attributes, please advise me.  I can pay someone to do this.  With regards to the Martingale DD (DrawDowns) that may be very excessive at some times (when recovery mode kicks in) and we are faced with over 4 trades in recovery .... is there any way to put a general stop loss based on equity ?  I understand that that may reduce considerably the profits since we do not leave the chance for the EA to recover ... but the option of some kind of safeguard may be nice for testing purposes.

Thanks again and have a great day.

Hi acey,

closing in lose is result from the condition coded in the ea to prevent larger losses. Looking at the result you provide all 5 losses trade comes from 5 pair. That is also possible if you are running multiple pairs.

The fact is that from the back test result single pair with consecutive loss is around 5-8 trades. (can't remember exact number) and that base on GBPUSD with 90% model quality.

I would encourage you to have the testing going. May be we can find a way to improve it.

Thank you for testing

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi,

This is for anyone with some code skill and would like to back test.

Closing condition (default)

Inserted Code //#common   Inserted Code void CommonSingleOrderState()
{
ft(lastticket); //trailing stop loss function this will move stop loss up and prevent going back to loss when profit.
if(iBars(Symbol(),Period())>bbb) //do it every new bar
{
OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove(); //you can Find this function and make change
BuyThenImmediateProfit();  //you can Find this function and make change
//PositionLossAfterHrsthenClose();
bbb=iBars(Symbol(),Period());
}
}

then if I look at the function called "OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove"

There are some variables use into closing condition here.

Check whether how long from last time stamp (either buy or sell ticket were placed)

this case more than 2 hours and less than 8 hours -->hr_sec(2) and hr_sec(8)

RRR (Risk Reward Ratio)
RRR = max_gain/max_loss

max_gain is maximum gain recorded during time from the time order were placed until now
max_loss is maximum loss (draw down) recorded during time from the time order were placed until now
max_loss is always negative
max_gain is always positive
pl is realtime order profit

I recommend you guys can try to deviate from this.

Inserted Code void OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove()
{

if(TimeCurrent()-laststamp>hr_sec(2) && TimeCurrent()-laststamp<hr_sec(8) && RRR!=0)
{

if(1/RRR>=1.5 && -max_loss>=10 && pl>=5)
{
if(OrderClose(lastticket,OrderLots(),Bid,5,DarkGray)==true)
{
Print("Close order#"+lastticket+", REASON:OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove(), LOGIC1");
if(state==state_buy1) BlockBuyUntilTime=TimeCurrent()+15*60;
if(state==state_sell1) BlockSellUntilTime=TimeCurrent()+15*60;
}
}
}

if(TimeCurrent()-laststamp>hr_sec(3) && RRR!=0)
{
if(1/RRR>=5 && -max_loss>=10 && pl>=-20)
{
if(OrderClose(lastticket,OrderLots(),Bid,5,Goldenrod)==true)
{
Print("Close order#"+lastticket+", REASON:OrderOpenTooLongAndNotMove(), LOGIC2");
if(state==state_buy1) BlockBuyUntilTime=TimeCurrent()+15*60;
if(state==state_sell1) BlockSellUntilTime=TimeCurrent()+15*60;
}
}
}
}

Hi Gotzaa

Just an idea ... from my back testings that shows that very often we are in recovery mode after one (1) bar spike.

In your first series of conditions, you specify last 5 bars (M15) must be larger that 40 pips. Maybe if you also add condition to exclude when last one (1) of two (2) bars alone is over 40 pips. So 5 bars cumulative true range must be greater than 40 pips ... but if last bar (or last two bars) is larger than 40 pips on itself ... no trade...wait.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hi Spar,

pls look into  Inserted Code void ft(lastticket)
function.

I still wonder while sometime the trailing stop does not kick in also. But mine is rarely happen. What I think is if the ticks are too fast, and MT4 fail to complete the computing cycle and fail to trail stop.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
reply below

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Not so sure on how to code it but probably we could increase the range where the EA test the bars?

Then after placing a trade the EA can self check open position if it is going > or < the High/Low the test bars range and then reverse buy or sell if it detects: absolute value of (current price - high/low of bars test range candles) (< ) less than the High-Low for a 1-3 candle recent candles in the opposite direction. This means there is a spike in opposite direction thus close current position then open opposite position.

I'm not sure if what i write above is easy to understand or not.. hahaha...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
We must specify that the last 1 or 2 bars is the opposite direction of the last 5 bars range. If it is the same direction, the we can trade because the probablity of continuation in the direction of the spike is large.

What other cross pair do you recommend

Thanks

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hello Acey2424

I think most of us have the same open losing trades as you at this time.  I have EURNZD / GBPUSD / EURAUD / GBPNZD.

The rules of entry of the EA have been respected and it all is ok.  Don't forget that this strategy is a "Counter Trend" approach as explained by Gotzaa in his first post and first page explanations.  So it is normal that the trade open is in the opposite direction of the trend that you see on the chart.  The theory is that after a certain move in one direction, there will be either retracement or change of direction whereby the EA will take profits.

Please correct me if I am wrong ... but that is the way this EA should work ... and works just fine.

A+

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi EliteIncome

I pasted below the information provided by Gotzaa in his first post No. 1 ....

Usage:TF M15 Best for GBP crosses pair such as GBPCHF GBPCAD GBPAUD GBPNZD GBPUSD etc. For those who want to try it out and see its action. I recommend running multiple pairs at the same time.Here are pair I recommend you to run simultaneously.EURAUD EURCAD EURNZD EURCHF GBPAUD GBPCAD GBPNZD GBPCHF GBPUSD  Change Magic number if you are expected to run on same pair but multiple chart (multiple ea instances), see instruction here. From my demo test, this bot will has high draw down on GBPJPY and EURJPY due to huge trend bar and little retracement. For your information.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
my GBP/NZD, EUR/NZD now in recoverymode with 3 trades opened each. 3rd trade each pair has higher lot size.

Hoping for the retracement and come out with small profit.

Hi iamgotzaa ,

not sure if you have seen this already http://www.mql5.com/en/code/11100

you might get a code idea from this good EA.

This is not spam by the way... i used this personally.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Patmontes

Thanks for sharing the link.  I already back tested that a while back (and some demo forward test as well).  Without going off the subject of Gotzaa's thread, the Milestone EA has quite some history.  It is very risky approach.  Even the developer of the code (Trevone) mentions to take out profits regularly because it is just a question of time before the account goes bust.  It's really great when all goes well ... but it goes down fast when things turn around.

With regards Gotzaa's EA ... honestly he is the brain here.  As participants, we can only try to add some input from our experience to assist him in fine tuning his approach.  If we try to add too many arguments to the code or attach more confirmation indicators, we may simply hurt what is a already a good EA.

The only thing we can add in my opinion is a way to filter out the large spikes that get us in trades that take 3, 4, 5 and more recovery trades to break-even.  I think that Gotzaa really thought of that quite a bit over the time he spent on this.  If we can find a statistical way of preventing this such as true range of last few bars versus cumulative last 5 to 10 bars, maybe it could help this issue.  Back testing would that change would allow us then to compare and see over the last 5 years if that would hinder more the profits or actually better the results.

Thanks again for your insights and link.

http://www.mql5.com/en/code/11023

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Yep yep good idea

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I have some idea to harvest pips from momentum same side with trend.

E.g

if i used StdDev (Standard Deviation) to detect the price movement.

Check current stddev and lagging stddev,may be 3 bars back.

Then check price sma or ema, may be sma5 and sma8, then I can tell direction of current movement.

If sma5 is over sma8, should be upward move. And downward move is vice versa.

Yep, and there are more in that variation.

Gotta try tonight.

Will release if I finish the code.

Already 10pm in Thailand, Bangkok here.

regards

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I haven't posted in ages, but I traded that trend today, so here is my analysis..take it or leave it.

CAD is in a huge strength across the board.  IF EURCAD retraces, it is very unlikely to get past 1.5175 (Daily Pivot).  If that is enough for your recovery, you might have a chance.  Sadly, none of the CAD pairs found any support at their current levels and EURCAD should reach 1.5060 before the night is through.

Or maybe not

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Iamgotzaa,

I ran the v66ba on 15min TF, but I noticed the TS/Stoploss didn't work, so I changed to H1 TF. On H1 TF, the Stoploss works but seems that the TS not working as some profit pairs finally closed by SL with only 3 points profit. The recovery works as well even I don't know the results since no recovery trade get closed yet.

Here are the screenshot of the open trades & acc.history:

What I coded in there for Recovery isif positions are less than 4, it think it can take some pips out of current ATR some pips for profit is squeeze_factor (0.3) x ATR means i would like to have only 30% from current ATR (depends on the session they are recovering) so if ATR is too low, and 30% of it is too less, then i would take 3 pips (just enough to buy a candy ^_^ ) if positions are more than 4 but less than 8 (we are in deep shit) I would take just a half of 30%ATR --> if 30%ATR is 3 pips, then I take 1.5 pips (which in high spread pair, you already loss) ...which I think better than loss a lot more if more than 8, SHIT, i'm giving up... pls take my money, Mr. Market. i'll take fraction of pips only 1/10 of 30%ATR Version before 66b, I make it loss the capitol... and it's totally ugly

What broker you use? Server open time, NY Session?

Yes, To all participants.
Can you make simple analysis by pair, trade side, win/loss rate and avg. pips?

it will be great. At least we can compare "what" is best for this 66b version.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi Gotzaa

Not sure if the PDF file included herein is in line with what information you want. Please advise if you want more detailed information.

Please keep in mind however that the trailing stop loss does not work more than 25% of the time. So I have to manually add a trailing stop (MT4 Script) when I see that the trade is in profit. So there is some discretion trading in these results which may render the summary a little skewed.

Regards,

Spar

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi

any idea milestone works on which pairs and what TF?

thanks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
noted.

placing manual stop would be a good intervention too.

we all are here to make profit

not racing in EA intelligent

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I concur with you that manual intervention is acceptable.  I actually never traded with an EA ... but use them for back testing a theory only.

In this case, I just cannot understand why the trailing stop loss does not work all the time.  The reason you gave yesterday makes sense if there is a gap or ticks are too fast and the calculation is not made.  I will ask my programmer if he could understand what is wrong with the code or what situation can create this issue.

Please advise on the type of report you want from participants.  Maybe some kind of uniform table that we all use to report win/loss, average, pips ...etc.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Fredgold

Milestone ... was geared for M5 EU ... according to old information on the subject.  Martingale and no boundaries for SL,  always a disaster on a long term basis.

MadTrader ... was geared for M5 GBPJPY and there are other presets for other pairs such as EU.  This EA is even worse ... back testing brought a 10K account to 450K in less than 10 months and lost everything with one trade.  The problem is that trading on the right side of the screen could let you dry on the first trade.  A member on this forum has a funny signature ....   BackTesting = Holy Grail ... Forward testing = Holy Shit  !!!

Hopefully I do not offend anybody by distracting from the current thread.  I also doubt that there is anything valuable in the theory and code of Milestone and MadTrader that can assist Gotzaa in improving his EA.

A+

--- 帖子 #174 ---
don't worry no offense taken.

I was referring to the madtrader and milestones ability when to take trades(has a calendar function to avoid major news v22.5) and in what direction (madtrader adx rsi i think v8.7).

--- 帖子 #175 ---
quite a dd since yesterday

--- 帖子 #176 ---
but rethink of the ticks

if it fail the first tick to trail, it should be able to do the next tick because I put it to do every tick function Start() or On_tick().

May be it's just fundamental error where the stop loss price I inserted is invalid.

Spar, do you get any error code from the Experts log tab?

gotzaa

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Your logic is very true and I do not have any error codes in Experts Log Tab.

In backtest ... the trailing stop works perfectly on all pairs.

As mentioned in previous post... if you don't have time for this issue, I will try next week to have this fixed with my programmer because I am not strong enough to code MQL yet.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi Patmontes

Yup ... I was thinking of your reference to those EAs and the calendar function to avoid news.  That could be a nice feature but I could never get it to work properly.

With respect to RSI and ADX ... I think Gotzaa is a naked trader and does not rely on any diluted indicator that derives from price action.  He seems to rely exclusively on the price action, it's range, the current position within that range and the theory that supply and demand will weaken after a certain excessive push in either direction.... whereby counter trend opportunity kicks in on the retrace or change of direction.

So in that perspective, I doubt that we can find any dragging indicator that can help this algorithm.

Nonetheless, those EAs were really fun to backtest.

Good trading.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks Iamgotzaa for the explanation of recovery process. But does the v66ba have trailing stop? And how will the pairs that are in profit be closed? There are some pairs with over 100 points profit but the Stop Loss remain 3 points.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Come to think of it, yes better not to have the indicators and just try to improve the code based on pure price action and direction.

The Calendar did not work anymore after Build 610. Sad...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I think the DD is okay as compared to the EA trying to recover and losing the whole account balance in the end.... admiting loss and fight another day is good at times and nice to see the EA handling it well.. for sure there could be days where this DD would be recovered.

--- 帖子 #182 ---

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I used to try those indicators before all of them, all provided in mt4 and those share in FF.

Plug them in combination... those does work for certain situation and really difficult to get it right.

Then I sway from that direction and focus only the price.

Like I mention in first post.

if it moves up, it is up. you buy.

if it moves down, it is down. you sell.

If lose, either fight or admit the cost of being wrong.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I am currently running v66ba and the results so far seem promising, had a loss on EURCAD today but the other pairs have started to recover from the loss.

Looking in the code the trailing stop is only used for reversed trades not for normal trades, there are also minimum pip values there as well to ensure now errors occur when trying to TS.

To fix the maginumber problem why not just create a unique hash of the symbol name and the timeframe for each pair, this avoids prefix and suffix issues and so is broker independent. I have the code from a MQL4 page just cant remember the link at the moment.

As for the news filter i think there is a new version of the FFCal indicator that works on the the newer builds. I have used the older version as a filter for EAs in the past so hopefully the functionality is still available. There is also time filter code that allows NFP and holidays to be avoided as well should you so desire, might help with the price spikes. Let me know if you are interested and i'll dig it out.

I'm quite interested to see how this pans out, still early days but heading in the right direction

Mike

Hi Gotzaa

Just to keep you posted with regards to the trailing SL.  It was my error by using "AutoID"... initially and then by using 1001, 1002 ...etc.  Your EA is working just fine for trailing stop losses when we apply the adequate external parameters.

extern bool UseAutoID=true;

extern int User_define_Bot_ID=1000;

extern bool UseAutoID=false;

extern int User_define_Bot_ID=200;

if(Symbol()=="GBPAUD")  _magic=200;

if(Symbol()=="GBPNZD")  _magic=210;

if(Symbol()=="GBPCAD")  _magic=220;

if(Symbol()=="GBPCHF")  _magic=230;

if(Symbol()=="GBPJPY")  _magic=240;

if(Symbol()=="EURGBP")  _magic=250;

etc ....

Everything is working fine for trailing stop loss.

Sorry for my mistake and thanks you for your patience on this matter ...

Hello,

What's the difference between my trades and of your trades.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I've been running 66b for a week today with Oanda.  Banked return is 6.67% off a $5,000 demo.  I was originally running it with a lot more pairs than what's listed by Gotza on page 1.  I saw more losses with those though.  I'm now running the same pairs listed on page 1, but with the addition on GBPJPY.  I also started a demo with IBFX for a $1,000 as I may run this live with $1,000 after further testing as this is the same bank I have two live accounts running on a different EA.  I did notice that when running the $1,000 at default, I had to change the lot from .1 to .04 to allow similar trading executions as the $5,000 account with similar percentages.

Both these demos are published in my trade explorer for anyone's viewing.  Thanks again Gotza for letting us test and run this.

Good catch! Don't worry about it.

I still do not satisfied the current step in trailing stop loss. Most of the times, it banked in just a few pips (first time move stop loss). I want it to be more intelligent. Anyway, need to work on that.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I use 66b claim range 200 pairs GBPCHF, GBPAUD, EURAUD, EURNZD. tf M15. I have a lot of input daily. when you have only 4 inputs per day. What's the difference?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I think making the EA survive is top most priority that it does not blow the initial deposit... even if the earnings are low, aslong as consistent. But as long as the deposit is conserved. That is okay

--- 帖子 #217 ---
thank , got it

--- 帖子 #218 ---
ref: attached screenshots,

i was just wondering why during back-testing of 66b it seems to be working,

but during live trading it keeps "waiting for signal" - no trading was done!

pls help!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi all, just started to test v66b today- looking good but what was the consensus on running it through NFP? Does it have spike protection or news filter protection as yet?

I am guessing that if we have open trades we should close or manage them (add a hard SL) prior to the news?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Dear iamgotzaa,

many thanks for your hard work and sharing your EA.

I am very pleased that the EA works in profit.

Only one thing I do not understand: can i adjust the takeprofit or stoploss parameters?

Many kind regards and continued success

André

Too extreme

--- 帖子 #222 ---
i am agree with your last paragraph i did that during my test in this week.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
hello again, i want to update my result that i got with ea(version 66b) , my total profit is $1271.00 since Monday until today.that is great

but i should tel you that i manually put stop loss or closed the position when it was in profit, sometimes the TS doesn't work properly that needs

to be consider. have a nice weekend for all

best regards

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Only two days, but I'm quite happy with the results. I'm running 24 pairs, so I can

cherry-pick the best of the lot after my test is completed. Agree with the above

poster regarding the TS. I have a couple of floaters that I'm going to close out

manually, instead of letting them get chewed up by the TS.

Mine is doing the job quite well during one week !

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT_...d-pairs/905637

@Rob: so, plz keep on posting the outcomes made with all pairs - that's quite interesting to have a look on the results of (so far) nonrecommended pairs !

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Seatrader888 your EA appears to be turned off try clicking the Autotrading button on your trading platform, I think you'll get the big smile instead of that frown

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hmm, i try backtest using default settings...no trade. did i miss anything? or it does not work on backtest?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi Gotzaa,

Your coding idea have catch my attention, so i've read the whole thread and also downloaded the libraries. But those on post #1 have not been upgraded to please the latest mq4 coding rules; so metaeditor complaint with endless errors list. The '.' have to be replaced by '_' for example; and there are some others '$' & so on to been fixed first before compiling the EA itself. So i wonder if the EA really use these librairies ? (will see later on compiling/testing ). Note that all coded EA now should send order with the ecn style (2 steps: order sent first, then after checking that the order exist, set the sl & tp).

As my own contribution to improve that counter trend advisor:

- when an order is placed, why not also sending one or more pending limit orders to catch some pullback (with a time expiration indeed)

- to detect the real trend: see the big picture on W1 tf, then compare with lower tf to know if it agree with w1. Setting a ratio "daily pivot/weekly pivot" (set it external to find the most secure level while testing), in fact 2 : one for upward trend & one for downward trend). Note that each pair has its own historical volatility; meaning that custom pair settings have to be found & used. When done, its easier to follow the lower tf (m15 for example) with a sma5/sma8 cross (or else)

- each pair or pairs group have its own main market hours, where you can find the ranging/volatil activity. So the trading hours have to be set for them.

- and finally, knowing where price has high probability to bounce (long trend channel) help to place good orders and trailing closer (let the ts far away when not near  support/resistance).

Here are my first comments before diving deeper in the code. More post later.

Thanks for that thread.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Thank you. Iamgotzaa.

I am backtesting your EA. Very impressive. But sometimes it will destroy the whole account. Have you any idea to deal with it? Or at least make maximum drawdown like 20%.

Anyway great EAs.

I have translated to new metatrader 4 version 625.

And I have also dealt with the path problem. Put all of them in your MQL4\Experts directory.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
thanks

its' quite hard to code but developing a strategy base on what you described it hell a lot harder. And it is so complex with dealing with those kind of support and resistance zone & decision.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Awesome!!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Week 02, APR28-MAY2 result updated

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I try to make that coming for next version but for v66b, I think I need more time to re-do. So busy with day job and more thing in my head for next version.

will post the update here.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
ok

this is it!

as promised before. from the feedbacks you guys gave me.

Name: MayDay
version: 0.2.0

features/highlights:improve entry from Feb10v66b, to be more like trend follower (v66b was absolutely counter trend)entry condition has been changed  improve close order logic decisions when feels i'm gonna money, something are considered to closehow fast you losing (pips/bar) how long the order has been alive RRR  emphasize on reverse trade direction,stop loss on reverse has been removed REASON: back test result show significant losses in many times  more settings (Setting explanation describe here) add experimental "hedging" strategy but will be turned off by default in this version, user can experiment the hedging strategybut trigger condition to go into hedging with still sucks my hedging strategy also sucks use at your own risk  Build 646 compiled AutoMagic function is the same, REASON: you are able to resume bot session after restart MT4, if using random number, you are screwed to close all open trades before running. all default settings, give shown back test result. settings have not been optimized for neither DD, balance nor %win. 20% DD still an issue for me. User must pay attention and make intervention.
Setting explanation describe here

--- 帖子 #235 ---
thank you so much for all your hard work, i will try this new version on next week.

regards

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I am unable to test Mayday 0.2.0. It will not compile in my build 625 platform. When attempting to compile, it shows 58 errors.

Can you post the .ex4?

Rob

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Thank you for this...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
The same happens here...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Copy {Lib4, OA, Trade}.mq4 into the same folder where your EA is located and compile again.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thank you,that solves it...But,shall the files stays in the expertfolder?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Doesn't solve it for me. Putting the three files in the Experts folder brings up 101 errors and 3 warnings - worse

than before. The original instructions were to install Lib/OA/Trade in the Libraries folder, so why should they

be in the experts folder? In any case, the EA will not compile either way.

Rob

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Because MayDay0.2.0.mq4 includes them from the experts folder.
Inserted Code #include "Trade.mq4"
#include "OA.mq4"
#include "Lib.mq4"
Doesn't really matter where they are but should be consistent with the code.

Change this to
Inserted Code #include "..\libraries\Trade.mq4"
#include "..\libraries\OA.mq4"
#include "..\libraries\Lib.mq4"
if you prefer the libraries folder.

If you still get errors, post them or send me a PM.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi,

I tried to compile but got 47 errors.

Did I put it in the right folder?

I'm using Metatrader from Oanda.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yes, but your libraries are missing some "r"s.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Sorry I'm new to this...

What's are the "r"?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Just a typo in your includes.

#include "..\libraries\Trade.mq4"

#include "..\libraries\OA.mq4"

#include "..\libraries\Lib.mq4"

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You're awesome thanks...

Stupid me

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thanks for you EA, it is what i want actually for a long time.  But i think it may be better to change trade.mq4, lib.mq4 and oa.mq4 to trade.mqh, lib.mqh and oa.mqh so that we just put them into MQL4\Include folder.  Then include these three files in Feb10vxx.mq4.

#include <Trade.mqh>

#include <OA.mqh>

#include <Lib.mqh>

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Somehow I just placed the 3 files on my experts folder along with mayday and no errors during compile. Using build 610. Currently backtesting OTB settings.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I agree it worked for me

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Good good job man! Will let yoy know how it goes this week

--- 帖子 #252 ---
all working but no trades initiated....any suggestions

--- 帖子 #253 ---
sorry guys

forget the ex4 file.

now attached to the post

--- 帖子 #254 ---
u means mayday0.2.0?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Wow, i don't know that mt4 can run on mac?!?!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
yup paths also issue for some users here.

because it is using martingale recovery. I try to prevent not use it for all trades. Some of lose trade it will try to do "best" close for each situation. for this new release MayDay0.2.0 I included about 5 condition to close some of them try to close in profit too. Hedging strategy (which not working yet) are put into place but need more development in the future. This could bring us where Martingale usage is minimum.

HOWEVER, there are tons of situation in the market. User intervention may be required.

Anyway, from back test on GU for last two years, I am pretty confident that this EA are best for non-sense market or swing & spike conditions. Sideway I must says. And it even do best of crosses pairs such GBPCHF EURAUD etc. with non-USD and non-JPY

It does not suitable with the pair that has been into long term trend without smaller TF spikes & moves.

I have try to defeat EU and EJ on back test with this algorithm... result i'm a loser. No match with them

this is why on the first page I recommend only some pairs with no USD and no JPY

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Thanks, Flx23, for the advice. I changed the code per your instructions and all is well. Compiles with zero errors and zero warnings.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I attached .ex4 already. Sorry I forgot.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
In testing Mayday, I noticed that the second trade level is the same lot-size as the first(no 1.44 multiplier applied). Is this intentional?

Rob

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Thanks for the updates, but libraries still have compilation issues:

1) trade.mq4 : typo switch: Lot -> lots , then later: lots -> templots

2) trade.mq4 : ATR not referenced

3) OA.mq4 & Lib.mq4 : event handling function not found ( here Fxpro mq4 now use metaeditor 915 which is tagged 5 not 4)

4) MayDay: ATR is declared/calculated here, so you need to choose if you still want it inside trade.mq4 (where it is not declared/calculated right now)

5) MayDay: dailyATR is used but its math is commented out (might be uncommented)

So before testing the EA, these libraries need first to be fixed to get testing results we could trust. 1 & 2 are easily fixed, but 3 clearly tell that the new coding (>600) style is expected.

Found that post that will help people : https://mqllock.com/common-compile-p...der-build-600/

ps: 3) above fixed by glancing at an other lib (stdlib.mq4) : all libs need to be declared as such; simply add : #property library

ps2: Mayday compile: declaration of 'lots' hides global declaration in file 'MayDay0.2.0.mq4' at line 114 Trade.mq4 44 44

So here also its the new rules applied with >600 version. (all the variables have to be inside the function itself, otherwise they disturb the global scope)

--- 帖子 #261 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #262 ---
GBPCAD past 3 months backtest yielded 1k balance to 2k++ balance OTB settings.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Testing now with init lot size to just 0.01 same ccy 1k balance. Why am I doing this? So I can see what if we open multiple pairs with init lot size as 0.01.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi,

OTB settings are default settings ?

Divergences are also a good and easy way to place orders: they tell you "when to place", "at which level" and "buy or sell"

who uses mac? i cannot get my mac to install oanda. help please.

anyways, how's the ea going?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
put all files in MQL4/Experts folder

works on OS X

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi iamgotzaa,

where is the updated files? i want to try this ea again for this week.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
market is off now, my backtest wont work during weekends.

how u guys make it work?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
You think it's ok just to replace the old version with the new version on my live account with trades open?  I assume it picks up where the old one left off?

This is getting interesting.......thanks again iamgotzaa!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Quite interesting to interpret lagging indicator into form of price prediction, i should say.

honestly it work most of the time. And it follow price anyway. So why not react to the price instead?

sorry but i dont have faith in the indicators. Not my holy grail.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
It should. All v66b magic numbers are the same.

When it run if it find order(s).  It knows the state and what to do.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You put the file in right folder?

Back test cam be run anytime

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Pls check the post i posted.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
No compilation problems, whatsoever, if you follow Flx23's code instructions.

Rob

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Iamgotzaa,

Can you help me with this EA?

Probably won't take more than 30 minutes of your time.

Very simple one, I just wanna backtest it.

Any Pairs prefer with low spread assume 2 max

1) First look for any pairs within 60M timeframe (Prefer monitor every 5 minutes) , If High-Low < 15 pips and greater than 7 pips (this value can be define?)

2) Store the High Value and Low Value as a based

3) When it reach the High Value - 1, Trigger a sell, SL at Define Value X, TP at define value Y

4) When it reach the low value + 1, Trigger a buy, SL at Define Value X, TP at define value Y

5) Only trigger one trade and Delay value (user input)

Start # 1 again)

If possible (Within an 30 minutes of any Major News or Data release (Pause EA for X second) Predefine 1 hr

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Please don't mix EA's in this thread...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
that is what v66b does. very very similiar

except it does not watch tv for news.

edit: by the ways, thanks for the idea. May be I try send you separate PM

--- 帖子 #283 ---
yeah i'm thinking the same thing

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Sorry for the mixed...

I tried to back test your EA for last month data

With Period M5, M15 - Spread @ 2

It's only took 2 trade on M5

It's only took 3 trade on M15

Did I setup correctly?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi,

I find the EA (MayDay0.2.0) testing very well. Is it possible that the take profit level of the single trades can be increased. I am still new to this and want to know what part can be modified to do this. Also I find that when a single trade was profittable the EA do not try to open a trade in the same direction even if the trend is continueing.  As soos as multiple trades is opened all seems fine.

Regards

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi,

Sorry I figured it out. The squeeze factor has to do with the profit factor. The bigger the Squeeze factor the more profit.

I found something strange. When modifying the take profit level the Buy gets the iBars for H1 timeframe, but on the sell orders it uses the M30 timeframe. What is the reasoning for it ?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello

Getting pretty close to trying it on

a real account.

The trades last week which ran away

was the GBP/NZ EUR/NZ which tend to have a mind off there own

Will play around this week with right mix off pairs.

My situation is a bit different as no money out

just growth,and plenty of room for trades to move.

Will try that up date version also

Thanks:nerd:

--- 帖子 #288 ---
@iamgotzaa - I'm a bit confused about the new MayDay0.2.0: so could you plz now simply discribe which files to put into which folders correctly ? It seems to me reading the posts above, that were's some confusion about this question bcz different people posted a lot of questions concerning errors when setting up this bot  ....

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi DerBerliner,

Use the files in post 235. Copy the Lib.mq4, OA.mq4 and Trade.mq4 into the MQL4-Experts and into the MQL4-Libraries folders. Some of the versions of this EA was looking for it in the Experts foder and others in the Libraries folder, so if they are at both places it is fine. The MayDay0.2.0.mq4 and the MayDay0.2.0.ex4 into the MQL-Experts folder.

Hope this help.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Follow the instructions on Flx23's post #243 for using Libraries. Insert code exactly as shown, compile, and save as .ex4. I got no errors or warnings by doing it this way, plus my demo is live trading as I write this post, so everything is working properly.

It has been said you can put all the files in the Experts folder, but for whatever reason, I ended up with error/warning problems. For me, the Libraries setup does the trick.

Rob

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hi Gotzaa,

Can MayDay02 run on 4 digit broker?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #292 ---
you are right, troubleman... the Autotrading function was disabled at the time i tested on live trading....

now the auto trading function is activated and i'm gonna test on both v66b & mayday 2.0 versions on live accnt. today....

hope it will work....

thanks a lot, troubleman...

brgrds,

st888

--- 帖子 #293 ---
sure, the code is base one v66ba, which included 4-digit broker

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Inserted Code  //v66ba //create one point to pip for 4 digit broker switch(Digits) { case 5: { BROKER45="5-digits"; X45=1; units="Point"; DECPIP=MathPow(10,Digits); Print("v66ba: You are running with 5 digit broker server."); break; } case 4: { BROKER45="4-digits"; X45=0.1; units="Pip"; DECPIP=MathPow(10,Digits); Print("v66ba: You are running with 4 digit broker server."); break; } case 3: { BROKER45="3-digits"; X45=0.01; units="10Pip"; DECPIP=MathPow(10,Digits); Print("v66ba: You are running with 3 digit broker server."); break; } default: { BROKER45="5-digits"; X45=1; units="Point"; DECPIP=MathPow(10,Digits); break; } } POINTX=Point*X45;

down to 3-digit for some pair like Gold !?!

Have not try that out, why not?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
yup...got it run on 24pairs, so far looks good. It has closed some pairs with profit.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #296 ---
hmmmm... come to think of it.. i'm also curious on how MayDay will perform with Gold

--- 帖子 #297 ---
good morning iamgotzaa,

Just wanted to ask what does the comment RV mean on a trade?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Done

Testing it now

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Superb. Thanks so much

--- 帖子 #300 ---
last check. Need to debug it resume the state but won't fetch all required value.

pls take note.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Ok....thx, have not gotten around to changing it yet on the VPS.  Later on today.....  Cheers

--- 帖子 #302 ---
thanks for asking.

After check, I have to close all orders from last week. Yeah!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi Gotzaa

I am certain you know that most of us have been updated to Build 646 over the weekend.  So I don't know if the reason we had to close all the orders is due to a problem with the code (that won't fetch all required values) or if it has to do with the update of Metatrader Terminal.

Personally, several of my custom P/A statistic indicators do not work anymore and/or display weird X and Y Anchor positioning on the chart .  I guess some coding will have to be done to adapt to Build 646.

A+

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hmmm interesting thing happend with my E/AUD trades today with MayDay. First trade was a sell, then it went RV to a buy, then now an RV again to a sell...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
mine all negative. no winning trades.

how many hours will it take for a negative trade turn into a positive one?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
that is intentionally

keep watching

--- 帖子 #307 ---
from the back test I observed, there is a period of time when this EA is in favor with the market and when it is not.

Time will tell

--- 帖子 #308 ---
i think i saw this also on the back test and it ended positive!!!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
the trick is keep flipping the side and roll a dice hope that we are rolling in the right side.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
so the trick is we have to wait till the price move into the direction that we want?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
for a certain time & loss level it might close or wait depends on the algorithm inside.

lazy to describe. Search for "LOGIC" in the code

--- 帖子 #312 ---
will the ea manually close the trade for me because I saw some closed trades that I do not know where it came from ahahha and all are in profit...hmmmmm

and what do you suggest with the losing trades? close it or the ea will close it?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
up to you.

But for me i'm gonna let them go. Let the EA do its job.

I need to test anyway.

but if it is real money, it's all on you anyway.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I found out the reason why I have 2 big losing trades. EA open a sell position in the support level. If I am watching the trade, I will not in any way take that trade however the purpose of the ea is to make trades during the times wherein you cannot be in front of your computer.

Let's just see how it goes.

If you can see my screenshot, If I used my manual strategy,my chart is screaming buy....

But I would like to make a comment that 4 winning trades out of 6 open trades is good. I learned my lesson to manually close my trade if it is in the support or resistance levels and never let it ride

--- 帖子 #315 ---
What is worrying is that if a single trade was possitive the EA change to the oposite trade direcion. If this is done against a strong trend it can go on for a lot of trades that bring in the possibility of closing out on a margin call. Is it possible that if a single trade is possitive, to let the EA next trade be in the same direction. As soon the trade is at a loss then the multiple trades will kick in and from there it is mostly turned into positive trades.

In some tests I started with as litle as $100 to test this EA. On the EU (that you not advise) and running from 1 Jan 2014 it brought up a margin call. If the same test was from the Monday the 6 January 2014 it brought in some decent overall winning positions. I have made some changes to certain parts of the take profit size and the holding time.

Please see if it possible that after a single winning trade the next position will be in the same direction.

I totally agree with you

yup rite folder.

now market is active i can backtest no problem.

it happens to some of my EA as well

That is so weird.

ya eversince i updated latest 2 versions of mt4

most of my ea dun work backtest during weekends ^^

btw does this EA works on one direction only...ie LONG only or SHORT only?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I dont know what to say.

huhu

No it works for all order type

When does it close trades? Been in profit for a while but not closing any trades.

Regards

Mike

Edit: i am running Feb10v66ba, i've looked at the code and know for normal trades and recovery trades how it should work. I'm just puzzled as to how to check for each pair what the target is as when profit is up 8% of account i think it should be looking to close trades before giving it all back.

I will keep digging in the code but so far this EA is very interesting to watch!

--- 帖子 #331 ---
That is also my question.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I managed to get the trades to close in profit, i made the state variable an extern and also added it to comments, it was always 0 so i think the EA had got stuck in a loop. By manually changing to state_sell2 it seemed to read recovery trades and close basket of trades correctly now.

I will keep an eye on it from now to see what happens.

Mike

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Look good Fb6_Si?

Do you have any instruction on how to run it?

I have all the files in the right folder and compile everything already.

I try to do backtest but it doesn't work well

--- 帖子 #336 ---
These are the steps I took to load it. copy files to the appropriate folders. load up blank charts of the currencies I run (which is identical to the ones listed on page 1) and change to M15. You should have the EA you want to run 66a, 66b, mayday, etc under the Experts  Attached Image     I just dragged the Mayday expert to each chart one by one. Since I'm running a $1,000 demo, I changed the lot size to .04 instead of .1 as it came. Each one loaded one by one just fine and looked like this.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Is this seem correct to you?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Looks correct to me.  I also have a Oanda Demo running the 66b version and that's how it looks for me on Oanda as well.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #339 ---
BTW, I ran currencies like EURUSD, EURJPY and those didn't do as well as the ones listed on page 1.  However, that was with the 66b, not Mayday, so keep us posted if you start getting trades.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Looking good,aarontdang......

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Nice work! I'm using a 1000 account too on Oanda. Which pairs do you trade on 0.04 lots?

Is a 1000 account enough not to encounter margin calls with multiple pairs running?

in the code there is a state called state_buy2_hold and state_sell2_hold.

It is designed to hold the profit as long as it could after placed recovery order(s). If the price come above/below break even price (weighted avg cost) for buy and sell side, it will try to move TP away and insert SL right at the break even price. If price continue in favor of the recovery direction, TP keep moving up. If i'm not wrong it is High[1]+10pips or Low[1]-10pips for buy and sell relatively. And SL need to move up/down according to TP also but obviously it does not. (I think I didn't code it right)

However, there is a bug there definitely, it should close all positions after some satisfied money/pips. not just holding all position like that.

Anyway, please close all of them if you think it is sufficient in profit. If not I think it will just stuck there as long as it hit SL

.1 definitely wasn't going to work for 1000. I first changed it to .05 and that was still too close.  Running .04 can go below 200 margin level when 4-5 trades are open at times. I may have to go to .03 if I get a few margin calls. In running mayday I had two losses today.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
thank you very much, Let keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
would you try on multiple pairs? not just GU

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I try download the code and put it in the folders (Work PC)

working fine

may be it is the "mac"???!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
MayDay seems to behave correctly according to back test.

It is shown that in long long run closing losses trade is better than holding it.

Feb10v66b (& v66ba) are holding longer and closing criteria are lesser than MayDay. So what it mean? It mean that there is higher chance of DD may occurs than MayDay.

We are participating in the market. Everyone does not really know what is going to happen in the near or far future. We can only speculate what is going to happen. If it's right like what we think, we'are godlike(... just for a while). If it's not then, we are back to stinky human to clean up what we did (either close in loss or try another order again).

--- 帖子 #348 ---
thanks for the quick reply. Are you running "all" the pairs on the first page?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I would expect losses actually.  Was just letting the other poster know regarding my lot settings and possibilities of margin calls.  I don't think those were margin calls though, just closed losses per the script.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I completely agree...

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I am thinking to have a doppelganger concept with MayDay.

Let' think about MayDay1 and MayDay2.

MayDay1 --> real/main entity

MayDay2 --> doppelganger entity

if MayDay1 stucks in loss for quite a while (let's say >8 M15 bars or 8 hours), this doppelganger jump right in.

And then MayDay2 will either carry on next trade if entry conditions matched and do the same thing as MayDay1 does, while MayDay1 still recovering.

Then it does not waste time while recovering which usually I saw it took about 1-4days.

OR

MayDay1 & MayDay2 could multiply the output (either losses or profit) at the same time but different is slightly different entry conditions. Both of them has interlocking either time and/or order side.

you know what... if you guys can do code just a bit I can tell you where you can try out your entry condition, compile it and back test.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Every time someone shows me colorful chart with a bunch of indicators, it terrify me

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Guys,

Please be informed. I discovered a bug.

From virtual back test, I saw trailing stop loss function misbehaving. I think it is a bug in Feb10v66b & v66ba too. It will happen on single order state (b1,s1,reverse state)
Will try to fix it soon.

If you are running live, manual intervention is required.

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I think it should be okay lets say if MD1 opens trade incorrectly and price goes other way, MD2 can go the right direction...

Original MayDay opens at 0.1 lots.... then this new MD1+MD2 lets half it 0.05+0.05 lots.

Just to take note that all trades opened by MD1+MD2 per CCY must close following first in first out rules because of some brokers like Oanda where you need to close first trade opened first per currency.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Gotta be real brave to be running live.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Example of .04 with 1 trade and 2 recovery running.  May need to go .03 with $1000 running to allow other trades without a margin call.

imagine if we have multiple pairs on recovery... our 1K balance won't be enough

--- 帖子 #359 ---
mine entered buy at 1.9454 but still no recovery has kicked in. using 0.01 lots

--- 帖子 #360 ---
At the level of margin I'm at right now, I don't think it'll even accept another trade.

I would use $300/0.01/pair

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hi,

First of all thanks for this wonderful ea.

You use state transition in the main control.

So after starting the ea you go into the idle state.

At the end of the idle state you check conditions for switching to other state.

You check if you have one buy or sell trade open.

But what if you are in recovery and have more open trades.

I'm using 66b

Maybe it is done somewhere else.

Best regards

Huub

Patmontes, Fb6

It seems to me the server's time does effect the trigger. Since it rely on high and low value. Me GBPNZD recovery also.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi Gotzaa,

state_buy2 has this target_gain=squeeze_factor*ATR-Count30*30*POINTX;

state_sell2 has target_gain=squeeze_factor*ATR;

note that since squeeze_factor is less than 1, you are introducing additional decimal places.

So ModifyOrder on take profit will give an error.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Yes, that most probably is the reason why...

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi, I just read the few first and last page of this trade. I like how you implement the machine state, do a bit skimming through your code.

I also run my own ea in multiple pairs. I would like to share my observation, seems to me it is for the better to abandon a losing pair and keep exploiting the good pair. In the past I also try to recover the losing trade but I found sometimes it just the condition of the pair is not really suitable with the method used by the EA. I know it won't be pretty in the balance chart, but if the objective is to grow an account I do not really care how the balance chart looked like.

EA is not like human trader, if you do not provide some algorithm to stop it to trade the losing pair it will just keep trading(and losing in most cases). A human trader could decide to abandon a pair if he found that the pair is not tradeable, a simple mechanism is to stop it from taking any trade for a day or two if the pair traded is having one big loser or several losing trade.

ATM, I am using diffrent approach. I multiplying the position size after winning trade assuming it was in good position, even if eventually it was a loss some already covered by previous wins and ended for a small loss. If somehow it was closed for profit, then the balance would jump significantly. Just my 2 cents, hope it could improve your result

--- 帖子 #371 ---
man, your idea is also very good. Do you have any EA for the strategy?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I would like to ask iamgotzaa, here is my updated trades using your ea. When I woke up this morning, I had losing trades (please see the negatives). Can you please explain to me why I had those??? Please please. I would like to understand your ea more

Please disregard the 2 100 something profits at the very top, it is the profit using a different strategy.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
In my side-by-side demos, Mayday is showing more losing trades than v66b. Will have to wait a few more

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I am on a 4 digit broker and i downloaded the v66ba, but when i drag the EA from the menu to the chart it doesn't apply to it. I even check with right click on the menu for EAs and nothing shows...

What should i do now? I have all the files in the right folder!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
did you try to recompile?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Here is where things get dumb... I don't know how to do that. Some while ago i tried to test an EA with the built in MT4 strategy tester - i didn't know how to do that so i looked up some videos and threads on how to do that. I do everything the way it should be done and nothing happens - no report, no nothing...

How do i recompile the v66ba? And do i need to do the same for the Mayday EA?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
hi gotzaa,

I run the MayDay0.2.0 on 23 pairs, but it seems the TS doesn't work. Look at the pairs with profit > 50, the SL stay at  4 pips.

-Have you tried to put all the files in the Expert folder?

-If not,do so...

-Lock down your MT4.

-Open it.

-On top of the chart you see a yellow button beside(left) the button where you enable/disable the EA,PUSH THIS.

-On the left side you will see different folders,DOUBLE CLICK on the Expert folder.

-When open,DOUBLE CLICK on the MayDay EA...

-Now the source code for the EA will show up...

-On the top of this you will find the Compile button,PUSH THIS...

-After pushing this you will/will not get warnings in the bottom of your screen.

-If you got no warnings,shut down your MT4,open it,try to attach the EA.

-Did it work???

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I know how to enable an EA... Anyways

I also copied all the files for the v66ba into both "experts" and "libraries" folders

I opened the Meta Editor and double-clicked the Feb10v66ba and loaded it in the editor... I clicked "Compile" and 1 error occured. (uploaded a picture)

I have no idea what to do to fix the error.

P.S. Although i have problems with v66ba, i loaded Mayday EA on my GBP/USD chart with absolutely no problem and i've already taken a second trade with it that is starting to go into the profit zone. I have to agree though that the trailingn stop is either not working or it is in a very high range.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
iamgotzaa,

thanks for sharing this EA. Did some backtesting yesterday (10 years), swapped few non-GBP pairs (EA is running on 11 pairs currently) from M15 to H1 since results seemed to be much (in some cases three times) better. This resulted in +70 pips today, 4 trades worth -15 pips are still open. Some were manually closed (not sure if this should be done though).

Have You considered doing correlation research to find optimal setup of currencies/TimeFrames for this EA's trading? This might be worth checking up (will do so during the weekend and provide You with feedback).

--- 帖子 #385 ---
O M G

I don't have much resources to run much test, time and data.

the settings are from testing on GU only.

If you are able to do it then you have my support for optimizing the code

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I am a little disappoint that MayDay was not making profit as much as v66b in these two days.

I'm going to let it run for two weeks and compare the advantage and disadvantage again.

hmmm

what do i miss/??

--- 帖子 #387 ---
"OMG" was part of frustration upon me saying something wrong or was it more like "i like it"?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I love it

coz i don't have any data than EU or GU

and my day job is busy in the lab all day (until I get the project done)

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I run MayDay btw so profits are definitely there. All negative trades I am having atm are on pairs that pushed long-term Highs. Partial fault here is mine, though - I had to reinstall MT4 around 3AM London time and relaunched it after 9.00AM London time. Therefore, move up was already going on and EA grabbed signals around TOP of the move.

I say, let it run for a month. I will do as much reaserch as possible (on the basis of MayDay 0.2) and share it here later during the week.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Same experience here. Although my v66b, 24-pair demo, is starting to see DD increase.

This is probably due to having bad pairs for the EA, and too many of them.

Rob

--- 帖子 #391 ---
This is strange by the way - none of the trades shown by this threads Trade Explorer (atm) at the top of the page were picked up by MayDay. Today I've noticed similar behaviour (most strange one was when Explorer showed Sell on GBPCHF and MayDay opened Buy on GBPCHF. Similar time.) throughout 6 trades out of 23 that MayDay opened.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi,

I'm not sure, but in the algo is also ATR with D1 as time frame,

So different brokers have different time, different day values.

It could be an explanation.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi - so is this bug fixed already ? Not sure how to continue the test with 66b ...

--- 帖子 #394 ---
i check in my VPS currently running MD0.2.0, dont' see such error.....

may by just that pc I install mt4 got the data wrong

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi ! I mentioned this (your) post about some kind of a bug bcz you yourself wrote about it and you said you would post new version soon ...

--- 帖子 #396 ---
It seems 66b is running better than Mayday.  I'm sitting at 5722 from a starting 5000 demo since 4/24 (less than 2 weeks at 14.5%).  It's in 4 trades currently and equity is down $100 or so.

Mayday testing has only been 2 days though. That demo is sitting at 1024 from a 1000 demo start for 2.4%.

Oanda $5000 demo has had a 71% win rate only running 66b.

IBFX $1000 demo has had a 69% win rate running mixed 66b and Mayday combined.

I'm going to continue to keep these running side by side.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
feeling right now, I agree with you

yeah

need to adjust the closing order algorithm I think it is too sensitive

I don't know why, but this made me laugh. Hope you were only in Demo.

I also wanted to report that I stopped running Mayday as it wasn't doing as well as 66b.  I still have 66b running on a $5,000 Oanda Demo that has been doing well.  Check my trade explorer for those results.  I've also added a $1,000 demo with IBFX to see how well it runs with that bank and that amount with lower lot size.

--- 帖子 #413 ---

Big different is counter trend versus follow trend.

+500 pips v66b? on Oanda

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Yep, give or take 50 at any given time with open trades.  Has yours gotten about the same through your bank?  Started another demo today with another bank I use to see its results.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #417 ---
yeah....

i was looking at the v66b run last night.

it is good to move stop loss to safe zone when +8pips then move up to profit +3pips then

it is very often that price come back and hit SL even the price gain more profit upto +10-12pips but not reach the next SL move yet. So I was thinking if the take profit (close order) might need to be trigger when profit reach 50% of the box range (5 candles) deduct by 2 x Spread.

e.g. box range 20pips, spread GBPAUD 3pips

therefore

20-2x3= 14 pips maximum possible profit

then 50% x 14 pips = 7 pips

another example

box range 36pips, spread 3pips

36-2x3= 30 pips

50% x 30 = 15 pips <--could have only one move of SL step (which is 3 pips gain only)

if it reach 12-15 pips I should take

What do you think?

so what do you recommend to trade live? v66ba?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
It would be risky of MArgin call running that much pair. If i remember correctly, the suggested amount would be 300 with 0.01 pip for a single pair. I am running Mayday latest version with 4 pair from the recommended pairing. Would be another extra pair(NZD) if not bcoz of the spread is higher than preset value.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I'm just testing on a demo account with over 50.000 €, so a margin call is nearly impossible

I wouldn't trade that much pairs on live, but for testing it's really fun, and the results are amazing.

Hello iamgotzaa (and other contribs) (Apologies for length…)

It’s so nice to come across real programming (being just a hacker myself).  I like to find proper techniques I can maybe use. I had to load your 66b EA though as you all seem to be having so much fun!  I just started yesterday so it’s way too early for results. (All my mentors have always cautioned me away from EA’s, but here I am….  )

Anyhow, earlier on in the thread there was an issue with spikes.  Maybe you fixed that already, but let me offer this:

An EA I have disappointed me when a big spike came in my favor then fell back to resume whatever it was doing.  I wanted to capture that unexpected gain.  My solution was a spike detector which would quickly put a trailing stop on allowing price to keep going or capture profit if retrace, then just look for a new signal.  The detector would trigger the trail if LTF current bar range exceeded HTF ATR x multiplier.  Say I enter on M15 and target is H4 ATR x 1.5, current M5 gives an H1 ATR x 1.2 gain:  à trigger the trail.

I wondered if you might be able to use such an approach to solve the spike/SL issue. Or maybe it’s a stupid idea, idunno being just a hack…

I do not now use my detector as my trailer had issues, but that may be fixed now.  I expect to work it back in as I go.

Congrats on this promising tool

do u recommend test the EA for either LONG or SHORT only?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I changed time frame after trade was opened, it seems to have lost important info. I've not verified yet but it seems after info lost the trail does not trail. May also be the recovery does not recover. I will watch and compare.

Am I correct to think Feb66b trades the TF the chart is on? On my EA mentioned above, I use " extern int xTradeTF = 60; " which locks the TF to trade on while I can view the chart or open trades on any. Targets are based on the locked TF, not the current TF.

Same situation here with 66b. Everything started going south yesterday and today. Quite a big increase in draw down in a short time.

Same here.

First 2 weeks started with fewer pairs and using calm range 400 and feb10v70. This weekd 3rd week used few mayday days then switched back to Feb10 again but calm range 200. A little manual trading with UJ GJ UC

--- 帖子 #483 ---
hi, may i ask what indicator do you use to show those statistics, looks interesting.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
nice

--- 帖子 #485 ---
hi gotzaa,

running the MayDay02 on 24 pairs starting May 6 looking good, except the trailing stop & some orders closed in negative. Recovery works on some negative orders but don't know how they got closed. Here are the open orders & statement summary:

Nice one!!!! What's the leverage of that account?

I forgot the name but it is on the 2-3 page of this thread

--- 帖子 #488 ---
1:500. I use it OOTB except change the lot size to 0.01 and TF H1

--- 帖子 #489 ---
This give me a push for next version. Thanks belka.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
my 70b demo since 24/4 and 66b demo from 1/5 are both doing  well on Global Prime . pairs as in post 1

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Here's what the 2 week graph looks like on my live Robo Fx penny account trading the recommended pairs - v66b.  Nice!

--- 帖子 #492 ---
looks like all you guys have great week(s).

me too, except that huge DD on tiny account here. 125$ but running  4 pairs since last two weeks. heehee

I thought it was gonna blow up.

and it is so freaking hot here in the afternoon  37c

--- 帖子 #493 ---
May next week be better for us

Same here in Manila. Crazy hot. Also 37° + -

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Is there a 'bug' with some of the pair - 5 digit? I try to use the EA on USDJPY and i get the msg saying the spread is too high. But the spread for the pair is approx 2-3pips(non fix spread) - 101.856 / 101.878 :-/

p/s - using Mayday 0.20

Hello Iamgotzaa

Before going live

which will be real soon

on micro setting with say $10K

small trades,we will give the trades plenty of room to etc

But with the EUR/US taking a big dive on friday

The account also got hammered - $800 of previous growth.

Having the best mix off cross pairs,to protect margin etc

Will post pairs later on

Still $10k to $11K balance

--- 帖子 #496 ---
agree.

I test the demo couple months with EU and that account blew up too!.

this ea take pips from swing, crazy swing like happen in crosses pairs. not something like trendy USD or JPY

--- 帖子 #497 ---
may be

I have  not check with those JPY yet

Actually I shared after I complete back test on GU...

I'll take note.

New Demo Account Setup with 5K USD. Purely Feb10v66ba.

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/patm...b9IEYPjUyUdmED

--- 帖子 #500 ---
looks at the gap to TP today.

should be able to recover all.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
iamgotzaa, do you have a version of v66b that trades with the trend?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
@Patmontes

Looks good for a first day.  Are you using OOTB settings ?  M15 timeframe ?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I'm also running 66ba with $1000 at .02 though.  Looking good.  I'm running 66b on 5k and 66ba on 1k demos (1k I'm running .02 lot though).  Both are in my trade explorer for viewing.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I thought both the 66b and 66ba is the same in its trading method. Their diff is 4 & 5 digit, etc. Or im wrong?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Same algorithm yes.  However, when I started the 66ba version and found out that there isn't any real difference (Gotzaa reported that the TP doesn't work as well on 66ba however), I kept it going as is and didn't change it back to 66b.  For reporting purposes and also testing the TP (which seems to be taking profit fine), I wanted to state what I'm using.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Sorry im little confuse here. So which version - 66b or 66ba got TP issue? Or both of them? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Look at the end of page 23 and beginning of 24.  It's said that the 66ba version has TP issues.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Thanks a lot to clear the things up. p/s - it is highlighted now on the first page as well; or i have miss them when i read them in the past.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
hi  iamgotzaa

I just wondering why your pic is upside down?

it has something to do with coding?

regards

fred

--- 帖子 #510 ---
iamgotzaa,

sorry, I had to leave city for a bit - therefore I was not able to run all the tests I've planned and promissed. Anyway, since I want to get back to it - which version is the most proper one to run/make progress towards?

Yours

--- 帖子 #511 ---
v66b & v66ba the only different is I put a check whether running 4 or 5 digits.

Then it converts the offset value in trailing stop loss according to the server's digits.

If you are running 5-digit it is fine.

If you are running 4-digit server, then might see some improper trailing stop or won't trail it. (Like Belka reported)

so, happen only 4-digit broker.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
uploaded from iphone.. don't know why the heck it goes upside down.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I will assume you already download v66ba(edited) and able to compile.

go to line 314 and
Inserted Code if(Bid<LP(3))
it was like this

then
Inserted Code if(Bid>HP(3))
change to this

then it would trigger buy whenever bid is higher than last highest high three bars back.

also go to line 332

from this  Inserted Code if(Ask>HP(3))
change to this  Inserted Code if(Ask<LP(3))
then it would trigger sell whenever ask is lower than lowest lows from the last three bars.

I try than and.... it didn't goes well

reason?

My theory is that most of the time the market does not move in trend. it zigzag and zigzagging. Only some time it move and form into trend bar (either up or down). So, this EA harvest the zigzag or counter the wave try to sell high and buy low.

THis is why sometime it get caught on the trend bar.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
yes that's right  this EA is really good!

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Nice going!!!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I noticed on myfxbook it shows per trade the highest/lowest possible price that the trade could have closed for profit vs the actual price where the EA closed.

But also notice the Risk and Reward ratios per trade is good. This is good enough for us

Even if per trade the close price is not maximised, since the R:R is good, this will be profitable in the long run.

Nice work! iamgotzaa !!!

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Wow, I just notice myfxbook does provide such detail on each trade.

Thanks, Patmontes

Yesterday, I am testing the concept how to maximize the profit by calculating possible reward-pips from ATR & Variance. It could give a best guess where the swing end.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I'd be happy to try out after you develop it

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hello gotzaa,

I was hoping to see you comment on my post about changing time frames mid-trade.

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81#post7460181 post #479

I have more examples and happy to post if you think helpful. I suspect re-initializing necessary variables & arrays during init() would solve this issue. (I assume it is an issue) Should I just avoid changing TF and re-booting while trades are open?

TY, Needy

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Just witness real life retracement

--- 帖子 #521 ---
what ea is that? the ba? or the b?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
nice recovery!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Good Morning All..

A bit of DD pending but I'm confident this could be recovered.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
iamgotzaa , which pairs do you trade on the $200 account on your trade explorer here in FF?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
GBPAUD

GBPNZD

GBPCHF

GBPCAD

GBPUSD

5 pairs

--- 帖子 #526 ---
66ba

--- 帖子 #527 ---
It will be like reload the expert adviser program, if you clicked another time frame after an expert adviser already loaded.

Would you wait? not sure when will I have a time to fix this.

change my mind.

here is the v66c (same as v66ba but add the resume feature)

thanks,

we need your testings.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
thanks good man! I'll try to mimic with a $200 live account also

--- 帖子 #529 ---

--- 帖子 #530 ---
hi gotzaa,

I would like to test it, could you please attach the .ex4 file of the EA?

thanks,

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hello iamgotzaa,

Would you wait? not sure when will I have a time to fix this.

change my mind.

Thank You, will get new files in place ASAP. Will also post some actual results soon, and they do show what most here have been seeing: steady growth

Thank You Sir

--- 帖子 #532 ---
yeah

pls help.

thank you,

note that I am at work here, very strict internet access. No access to mt4 server.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Patmontes

I did close profit orders manually (base on my trade exp), if I feel some risk/reward is enough to protect this account.

so, not pure EA

since we are all know this EA is somewhere far from perfect.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Yes that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Can you post the .ex4 including the changes that you mentioned for trend trading? I tried to compile but I get a bunch of errors.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
here you go.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Few more minutes to go till some GBP news.. hoping for some recovery

--- 帖子 #538 ---
nope take a dive

--- 帖子 #539 ---
recovery trades kicked in 0.03 lots

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Alarming drawdown at times.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I notice it has a 'martingle' built-in. Do you know how it really works? Do it has a set limit where to cut-loss? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
ideally martingale does not do any good for trading, it make worse.

But my idea is that martingale concept will make a winning system better.

no cut loss when doing martingale, like jump on tiger's back then you can't get down.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Did you also notice what is on the first page? Recovery the position is based on martingale but have some selective algorithm (can be improved) to open recovery position. Drawback is may yield some high DD on small account.Recovery lot size = init_lot x exp^n (exp=exponent, n=positions count)  Entry position will not have target price because it will use trailing stop loss algorithm to trail the profit. if the robot's state is in recovery state, target price will be set to where gain was added to break even price (minimum 3 pips or more depends on volatility (or ATR)). if recovery positions are more in some range (4-8 positions), target price will be changed and admit the some loss. (rarely)

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Can't understand what's happened with your account today:  Mine is just Rocking....  Nothing special - just the same recommended pairs, OTB settings.  I also take profit manually sometimes and tighten up the TP once in a while but other than that, just leave it...... today has been outstanding performance; at present I have a floating profit.  Perhaps difference in brokers?  I'm on RoboFx penny pro

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Which version?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I wonder how MAYDAY users did today?

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Mayday should be doing fine for this situation.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
MayDay got +200 pips today.

Quite confused which EA to proceed to since I want to start live tests.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Well

i dunno

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Man if i gotout from this DD, i need to go test live MayDay again.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
yes i was imagining the same thing  Mayday would have racked up some major pips!

you think for Feb10 we can filter trades to be avoided 1 hour before and after significant news similar to the indicator below?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
V66b - just amazing, no idea why so much different.  Having a great day....no DD and lots of TP

--- 帖子 #553 ---
anyone tried this system in gold?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Which pair and settings are you using? I am running 66b as well with default setting and GU, UJ, EU, AU, UC, EJ, EG & NU and not too good today with total 90+ pips down at this point. I know its not the recommended pair, but i just wanna test how they works.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Here's my day so far:

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Running all recommended pairs

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Nice acey!!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Cool!!! Whats the spread on your broker?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
thanks sir

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I think i reduce the number of pairs i trade. I almost margined earlier with 12$ left free margin.... Hahahaha!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
25 sir

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Actually, looks at the system u posted before. Can you explained some more?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Keep up the updates on gold

--- 帖子 #564 ---
I found that it is often that the tp in recovery mode align with fibo retracement.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Mixed same pairs both v66b (or ba) and MayDay

I know Renko has no time limits, but I am referring to your sell orders.

That's it.

Hello

dude what sell orders are you talking about? I posted I am trading gold for that strategy.

[Quote = acey2424; 7468491] {quote} tizio che cosa vendere ordini stai parlando? Ho postato io sto commercio di oro per tale strategia. [/ Quote]

I just looked at your table with your order you opened and closed Post 556.

Ok does nothing thanks anyway.

Do not bother you anymore.

Hello

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I see. Trade was opened using my renko 5 pip strategy and set pending orders which has 2 pip difference for each. I have been testing gold using my strategy and it seems promising so I asked iamgotzaa if he can try or include gold in his testing.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hey All,

iamgotzaa posted v66c files recently but I had some issues compiling as I think some others did. I have done repairs and now it sings! Now I can scan timeframes, reboot or whatever and it recovers correctly .  I also added instruments to the MAGIC_LIST_BY_SYMBOL lookup: Gold, Silver, SP500, WTI (Oil) so I can test those.

Please note: the include files are renamed to avoid confusion, conflict and failure. It also avoids stepping on other versions. I believe convention holds that included source files belong in the "Include" directory and have the "mgh" extension. (Libraries are for compiled code like a DLL or ex4?)

The mqh files must go in the Include directory.

always a strong probability that the Recovery with 0.04 will reach the TP/38.2Fib level. EU/AU almost there. G/A a little more push. Hopefully the news in the next 30mins will push G/A there with if Aussie news is favorable.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
iamgotzaa, If i'm currently running Feb10v66ba with open trades on G/A then I open another chart for G/A same time frame as previous then put MayDay OOTB settings. It assigns same magic number as Feb10. What do i need to modify for MayDay to assign a different Magic Number for the second G/A chart?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Oh, please ignore my question... I set autoID to false then assign number manualy.

Now trying on demo myfxbook both MayDay and Feb10 on GBPAUD GBPCAD EURCAD EURAUD... lets see

--- 帖子 #580 ---
hmmmm

Some brokers Symbols have a prefix or suffix added to the 'normal' pair name. Maybe EURJPY shows up as EURJPYxx. I modified the MAGIC_LIST_BY_SYMBOL routine to accommodate that case. The Auto Magic number should be more universal now. Even so, there could be exotic pairs which fail the look-up and would fail to assign a unique number. Beware!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
how to install this reboot and where to put these files??

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi razalli,

On your platform, at the upper left is the 'file' button.  Click file -> 'Open Data File'.  The Data File will show sub directories including MQL4.  Click that and you will see more sub directories. The mqh files go in the  'Include' directory, the Feb10v66c.mq4 file goes to the 'Experts' directory.  Open the Feb file in MetaEditor and click compile. Now, back on your platform, you can add Feb to your chart.  After you copy the files you do not have to do the MetaEditor and compile part, you could just restart the platform, then add Feb to the chart.

Needy

--- 帖子 #583 ---

Which setting controls trailing stop? I'm finding that default TS is too aggressive so the winners are being stopped out too early.

My test of combination of Feb10 and Mayday today below. Those opened with May15th date are all May Day trades. Just proof both EA's can work sametime on 2 separate charts. Will keep on testing on these 4 pairs GA GC EA EC

Dammit

small account pressing me to intervene again!

My another cent account recovered also.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
You use different magic number, right?

--- 帖子 #590 ---
so can we say this EA is a total disaster?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
not at all a disaster, my two demos for 70c and 66b are doing very well

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hmmm the same here !

This one (66b) is doing a good job for me .... so far ..
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT_...d-pairs/905637

Have  no clue what happened today with iamgotzaa ....

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Yes thats right diff magic number on 2nd chsrt. So far so good...https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/feb10v66ba/918175

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Some risk is there not good for small deposit.

I over used it.

120$/0.01/4pairs.

Outrage,

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Man, i shouldn't close them. They were all about to recover. Human's false.

anyway still have init deposit  my $120

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Actually, the purpose of this account in explorer is to see how long it would take to double money by stress the deposit putting as many as possible pairs in without blew up or -50% dd.

I guess  5 pairs is too much.

But 3-week time I made 50% gain on $120 with min DD. (Before what happen yesterday, it should go well with out me. )

That's pretty significant.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Yes I agree this is good. Just need to budget well per pair in cases/scenarios as past 2 days. I also over set up lots of pairs on a 800USD account. Need to cut back to 3-4 pairs I think. But i'm now to 900USD....still good job for the EA being profitable over time.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
As long as I can cut loss to protect deposit, I can still make money with v66b (in fact, eventually it turns good, could be bad). I kinda kknow what to do with this EA already.

Thank you All Participants.
You guys ROCK!!

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Just let you know @Iamgotzaa - my account is still rocking along really well - a bit more drawdown today but nothing really.  Lots of T/P also

Just need to get the trailing working well and all is good.  Just looking through my collection to see if I may have a nice simple EA that does that - I'm sure I do but have to see if it will work on the new MT4 builds.

Cheers.....

--- 帖子 #600 ---
just want to second this sentiment and thank you Iamgotzaa for this powerful EA

--- 帖子 #601 ---
How's the version with resume function going?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hello iamgotzaa,

I found issue w/JPY pairs, at least on v66c. (Seems I recall you said JPY not good... ?)

Anyway just wanted to test. X45 is the culprit, I think. I changed to a 1 on one demo and seems work OK, not sure what it does elsewhere in code.

Aside from that testing shows nice results

Tanks! Needy

Hi Pat, seems OK from what I can see. Locks on to parameters after TF change as needed.

Can anybody plz help me with the 'Sudden Spike Hedging Scalper EA'? Anything about it's availability? It's link? Any information will help.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hey gotzaa, I'm just happy to contribute something.

I meant to include this in previous post:

Early on had problems with Point & Digits as related to price and display. Found the code below and thought it might be helpful, seems a tight little bit of logic. Turns out my brokers are all 5 digit so easy enough to just use Point*10 and never implemented it.

int iPip2Pnt; // slippage 3 pips 3=points 30=points

double dPip2Dbl; // Stoploss 15 pips 0.0015 0.00150

int Digits_pips; // DoubleToStr(dbl/pips2dbl, Digits_pips)

if (Digits == 5 || Digits == 3){ // Adjust for five (5) digit brokers.

dPip2Dbl = Point*10; iPip2Pnt = 10; Digits_pips = 1;

} else { dPip2Dbl = Point; iPip2Pnt = 1; Digits_pips = 0; }

found enhancement to v66's algorithm..

very exciting

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Great to know that. Mind to give more details about your new finding?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
This month so far.... ea can make pips but you need nice acc with small risk.. i spoted one thing, i use 4 pairs, every time 3 pair are maknig small profit and 1 pair is making bigger minus, and in aprox 1-3 days this minus get in tp with recovery trade... but what will hapend if this 3 rd trade will get busted  and trend goes more hundreds pips ...

i think that we need to focus on resolving this thing about 3rd trade and price going in a 100 200 300 pips more in a that trend...

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Oh thats well in deed!!!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
so now we are able to debug the entry with the visual data...

(which I only know how to interpret hahaha )

--- 帖子 #614 ---
right, I aware of the problem when sudden reversal bar form and spike and drag on..

anyway, as i'm writing now part of the algorithms have been done to address it. still need to verify on the forward test.

and need your participation too!

I think it is coincidence for the third trade loss.

7 days is g-chf in this 3 trades. for 0.5 pips was not closed in recovery tp.... let see what will hapend in the next few days...

second pic is status from this month, not bad....

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I found something similar to my cent account. And the ea does not place another trade. Reason? Not sure can be another bug.

It just placed only 2-3 orders and hang there. Even it reach the condition it should place another recovery trade.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I have 2 open gbpnzd right now. The 3rd trade for recovery did not open because not enough money last week when GbP buy pairs was in recovery. Now im waiting for it again to open the recovery for gbpnzd but none until now also.

hello iamgotzaa,

Thanks for the updates - I updated my source per your last post. You did also post the exe file but I just feel naked without source code. I Hate when that happens! Could you post the mq4 file?

Also, tho I suspect it is merely a display issue, the 3-digit 'units' may be wrong? On a five digit broker for jpy the third digit is tenths (point): you have units="Pip"; It's like on usd pairs the fifth digit is tenths and you have units="Point"; should be same same I think....

Cheers!

Hi Needy, belka, patmontes and all,

there is sometime that ea only place two orders even the price move to where the next trade must be place.

the issue is that the calculated lot size is not normalize and return error after OrderSend command was issue. This happen in recovery state.

pls download from this one instead for v66c_fix

What a bummer !

Have no clue what happened with your account, iamgotzaa - but is doing quite well ... I'm even in doubt a bit: is mine doing right ? ... AND: why is it doing much better then yours ?

Hello gotzaa,

Thanks fo da updates! Last week when I uploaded my fixes on 66c there was a change in there which i have restored to your last files.  I cannot see how Resume would work otherwise...  Please correct me if need be? Really would like to know if I am missing something.

Hello

I am testing Feb10v66c EA.

If I put 1 lot of initial lot size, do i have to change other settings of the EA input?

And do I have to change input in order to use recovery option?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Kimlie0401

No other settings changes are required if you increase to 1 lot.  Beware however that any settings beyond 0.1 lots at this point is useless as the account will blow to fast before you can take out your initial capital.  Even at 0.1 lot, it is unsustainable with one pair....just imagine with more than one pair.

See below results of back tests for the following pairs.  These results are based on historical data downloaded from Dukascopy (M1, M5 and M15) and tested on a $10,000 demo account with the standard settings and 0.1 lots in V66b, V66ba and V66c.  I did not test yet the latest V66c fix provided by Gotzaa.

The results are a little better with some optimization at "Calm Range" of 240 rather than 200, and 75 minutes rather that 60 minutes "Hold minutes", but nonetheless does blow account too often.  Not much improvement when I tried to optimize "Squeeze factor or Exponent".

The problem seems to remain in the "Martingale" approach in a strong uptrend especially when the last bar in a series of 5 bars is very strong.  Your hold position can last from 5 days and beyond and the account will blow once you hit 5 to 7 recoveries on that pair.  Conversely, the returns are not high enough to allow for you to take out your initial capital before the account blows.

So there is still a lot of fine tuning to be done before this EA is acceptable on a live account in my opinion.

Manage each trade separately for profit and never increase the size.

Under the basic assumption that price will eventually always make it back to where it started, as long as you are not buying absolute tops and selling absolute bottoms, you should be able to generate a forever hold...

With these, you have the option of closing manually if the draw gains to great, or can implement a major draw close per position.  ie, if Profit>=-75 Close Position.

This way, end of week, you are truly testing if your idea of triggering is actually valid.

Appreciating that you have your own triggering methodology, applying this to a grid under a "Guessed", range for adding trades is suicide.  These can easily create the death candle and range.  Working with a Trigger on Grid can help solve this problem as well as make the chart work more dynamic than would work Statically guessed.

So...your trigger takes a position...

And price goes against...

You've set a minimum trigger range and only when this range and the trigger are present can it take another position.

Eventually, price will make it back to one, if not both positions, but if it doesn't, you cover your ass on MM and as they are both the same lot size, you are not multiplying your misery.

Trade 1 = .01.

Trade 2 = .01.

Trade 3 = .03.

Depending on your time frame, trigger and range, you may not see a lot of trigger or trades per week, but you will see that when the trends kick in, that some of your positions will move greatly into profit.

Trail this profit by percentage of net gains and close on the slide.

If your trigger is good, and I have been watching, it does work well...you will see that a lot of your trades come clean, you can add a lot more positions and though this will not generate hundreds of percent per week, it will be the slow and steady growth.

In the event that the trades get out of control...close all and start fresh weekly...

Without manually closing positions and without any MM, here is an idea of what millipede equity curves look like.  HERE.

This is off of the M1...and really, my first attempt at a millipede.  My current one, I believe will run a lot better, and definitely keeps your from being wiped out on any single market movement.

Hi Gotzaa

I hope you did not perceive my last post as negative.  Your algorithm was actually very intriguing from the start and I definitely appreciate your logic and constant shared efforts.

I still think you are onto something here for scalping rather than long term trades (as short term trading fluctuates so much intraday and ZigZag seems to be prevailing versus trend).   Although I personally prefer trading manually, I am looking forward to your ideas and logic with respect to this EA which may prove to be stable.

A+ and thanks for sharing as always.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
hi, iamgotzaa

i am trying your ea - feb10v66c_fix with demo account on xm.com

current open trade as belows,
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

may i ask you, how it would decide to close a profit position?

thanks...

--- 帖子 #673 ---
it use trailing stop loss mechanism

e.g.

single position

if profit >8 pips

move stop up over breakeven by+3pips

then if distance from market quote more than stop loss than 8pips again

move stop up +3pips

and continue until stop loss is hit.

multiple positions:

or recovery mode

it will set the tp for all positons

but there is a hold state

is where cummulative positions are in profit then (speculate) that the market would continue to gain more pips, so it keep move up the tp& sl every bar M15, until one is hit. But multiple positions modify order does not work well. So you can see it hold the positions like that.

need to manually close them

--- 帖子 #674 ---
don't worry

there is a pitfall in martingale, I know it all along. still try to find a way to control it.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Dear iamgotzaa, dear all

My experience with all Grid- and martingale-based EAs is the following: they will blow your accounts once a day. 100% shure. But I found a way to use them in a saver way:

I'm using this way with the milestone- forex-hacked- and even since some weeks with imgotzaa's ea (thank you for your work).

1.) Identify the overall trend on D1 or Weekly-chart.

2.) Let them only trade in this particalur trend (using the only long or short dropdown box in the common-tab in the EAs propterties). I'm to lazy to modify the code of the EAs, since this trend doesn't usually change often.

3.) Start after big political fundamentals (FOMC, ECB decisisions). NFPs had not much importance in the last month's. But they could also be a big market mover.

4.) Stop one week before FOMC and ECB fundamentals. On these weeks you can trade in both directions, but with lower lotsizes.

This is in my opinion a way to control them. The hard way is to identify the trending or ranging market on the D1 using an EA

Best regards PBPTaker

--- 帖子 #676 ---
thanks for your prompt respon..

is trailing stop loss always 8pips for every pairs or it retrieves the value from the broker for each pairs?

coz, i dont see any trailing stops and i have to set it manually from mt4

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Can you kindly show samples so we can understand better? If we trade with trend how will it work with Feb10 since it is counter trend?

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Well, for example on the eur/usd on the weekly there is a clear downtrend, and even on the daily it is in a downtrend stage (supply is above demand, and RSI is below 45)

Then the only thing I'm doing is to allow the Martingale-based ea to trade with this trend. Since the Martingale-based ea is usually tading Counter trend but on smaller time windows, then the Martingale-based ea will be more successfull without to much risk (since there are always retracements). I do this in clear trending markets. If the market on D1 or Weekly is showing as ranging, then I let them trade in both directions, but with lower lotsizes.

The only pitfall is if the market is changing on a bigger window between directions (from long to short or vice-versa). Then you have to close your trades manually. So the Goal is to identify the market movers by fundamentals, and to let the ea wait before the big fundamentals. This makes shure that you don't have to close to much trades which are in a wrong direction. The smaller window follows the bigger window. Because the bigger window is the boss. Well, nut shore how to corretly upload printscreens ... sorry about that.

This approach could be implemented in an EA, but can be done manually since the trend in bigger window is not changing often.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Nice explanation. Will try it one of these days

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Iamgotzaaa,

I started to try mayday on 1 Hour time frame yesterday on GAud. Look some profits but trailing could be improved... 1 hour TF seems to be sweet. If you have time maybe you can do some bugfixes and resume function also on mayday like 66c?

I'll continue testing on 1hour TF

--- 帖子 #684 ---
it's  v66c_fix

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I need to automated that process somehow.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
But for shure you will get less trades. But those trades would be more on the save way. I lost enough money with martingale-based EAs. Newbees (as I was) are using martingales. Their accounts are growing like a hell. But their accounts are beeing blowed constantly.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
The hard thing is to identify the trend on the D1-frame in a fast way. I'm currently using the support/demand indi from pz-trading. But this one is not free of charge. I guess that your logic on smaller timframes (I was to lazy to try to understand it) would be probably good enough to identify the big trend.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
One of array out of range, line 835. Only array use in this ea is order list. OrdAcc...[] someting

i shall take a look.

Have u try to back test with v66ba?

Thank,

--- 帖子 #692 ---
yeah, i test it. but i had some problem at there. specially at the others libraries when i try to compile!

Actually, i try to using the v66c_fix version because of that problems on v66ba.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi iamgatzaa,

With the Feb10v66c_fix version if a trade is very profitable it moves the trailing stop the first time to end in profit. If the price is still going into more profit it fails to adjust the trailing stop any further and when the market turns it triggers the original trailing stop position.

regards

--- 帖子 #694 ---
it does move stop level up/down for buy/sell.

I still wonder why sometime it does not. Most 99.9% of the time it does from my live/demo.

first modified stop level would give me 2-3 pips, then +3 pips until stopped loss out.

Hi,

This week, I'm looking for patiently testing Feb10 v66 + CCFp controller. I have put it into play since last Thursday night (GMT+7) in the trade explorer above.

I mod v66 a little bit to receive the GlobalVariable values from the CCFp's EA (just broadcast the value of CCFp). In the picture attached.

CCFp EA is additional EA that act as a controller who known the overall landscape of the forex market. It know which currency is stronger than the others and which one weakest one. From the values then Feb10 determines the "side" of trade it can trade.

e.g.

if GBP is higher than zero

and CAD is lower than zero

(simple logic apply here)

I shall BUY GBPCAD according to the strength and weakness of both currencies.

This way, Feb10 will induce less trades per week. But it also shall reduce the Max DD.

CCFp is not a trend identifier but it yield high possibility for winning trade.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Code for above post

CCFp EA

and

Feb10v66ccfp (base on v66ba ) NO JPY NO Gold NO RESUME ​

usage:

CCFp.mq4 go to ../Indicators/

the rest go to ../Expert/

compile CCFPEA

open any chart on H1 (just bigger than M15, you can try H4)

drag CCFp indicator on that chart (first time it will show no line.. try to click other time frame (and wait) then click back to H1 or H4 a few time

Once it shows the line and values

drag CCFPEA on that chart

.. wait 1 minute.. (it does calculation every 1 minute)

.. hit F3 (to see Global Variables)

you will see list of ccx(Name) like my screenshot will decimal value.

then drag Feb10v66ccfp on pair you want it to trade

...(drag drag drag)

If that pair CCFp is allow, it will shown comment "CCFP Allow BUY" or "SELL"

..

that's it/.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
ok!! nice idea once again! let me help out testing this later when i get home to setup everything.

what are the directions for the CCFp and CCFPEA mq4 files? need to just copy them in indi folder and load to chart? or no need to load to the chart?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
oops forgot

see my post

--- 帖子 #700 ---
I have to mention the value returns from CCFPEA is not current CCFp but the rate of CCFp of past 3 bar (H1)

why using rate?

We cannot determine the direction of anything if we know only one point of reference. Using two points (or multiple points) to reference, compare them you got the rate.

Same thing in measure speed. You need where you start and where you finish by how much time. e.g. jogging 3 miles/hour from my house to the park.

Apply this to CCFp, if the currency is strengthen/weakening itself over time, we can know by the rate.

why 3 bars?

CCFp is wavy. 3-bars is smoothing number. I hard code it. and it is not optimized number.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
thanks!! lets see this in action later

...although I would have to close any existing trades open since there is no resume right?

iamgotzaa, I wonder if you have now moved on from 66x EA? I see your playing with 66ccfp now.

66 seems to work well despite serious draw-down, many many trades go to recovery

Been thinking of putting Mayday on for demo. I wonder how peeps are doing with that?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
My personal goal is to run with $100 account 0.01 lot without blow it up.

that's why I move to do something little different with CCFp.

but v66 is the core of everything now.

I try to rewrite the code to be more OOP kinda-thing because the code getting bigger and bigger, it's hard to control.

IMO, even it does make you serious pips for a certain period but with martingale recovery. It will blew the account one day does not matter how big the account is. And even worse if we are running 24 pairs at the same time!

Feb10v66ccfp

DIY fix:no trade issue. find these lines in Fev10v66ccfp.mq4,

and put // in front those "percentile.." thing (1,1.1) and remove // from if(true) (1.2)[code] //PercentileSafetyLevel=PercentileSafetyLevel(OP_BUY,barpercentile); <--- (1)

//if(PercentileSafetyLevel<neg_percentile) <--- (1.1)

if(true) <--- (1.2)

[/code] there are two portions of them, same thing

[code] //PercentileSafetyLevel=PercentileSafetyLevel(OP_SELL,barpercentile); <---(2)

//if(PercentileSafetyLevel<neg_percentile) <---(2.1)

if(true) <---(2.2)[/code] this will remove the filter where price in current bar need to extend more than xx percent from current range. it was set to neg_percentile of -30, it means that the price must extend beyond rang of past 24 bars by 30% (lower than lowest low) or 30% (higher than highest low) which is hard to happen if market does not move.

and this is why you got no trade with the market like this, barely move at all.  remove uneccessary print to log[code] string pairfront,pairback;

pairfront=StringSubstr(Symbol(),0,3);

//Print(pairfront); <---(3)

pairback=StringSubstr(Symbol(),3,3);

//Print(pairback); <---(4)[/code]  if you will not know what you'll be doing, copy .ex4 below to C:\Program Files\xxxxxxxxxxx\MQL4\Experts\

in the demo is debuggin on the fly version.after I posted here. I closely monitoring in real time to see all the actions happened.I'm not sure whether to keep posting edited/update version now of wait until the code is stabilized.

Good morning all and iamgotzaa,

Yesterday during market open for the week I noticed ccfpea didnt display its normal values and had to re-load it. After doing that, it went back to normal.

Othernews, my eurcad buy in feb10v66c _fix recovery mode 0.06 finally closed for small profit yesterday and I'm very happy to switch it to feb10v2.. relief!😧

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I saw the post on your blog and the one with the smoother curve. What is thr difference between the first account AGEA?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
v2.00 (without force indicator) does not want to trade. v66c traded.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
is it right to think that all the pair combinations possible as long as both pairs are on the CCFP, we can trade them with the FEB10V2?

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Hi iamgotzaa !

So where are you ?

Have no trades using the new v2.00 ?

Anyway the c-fix is doing best, the former b-version is acting a bit strange: I have now trades in good wins, using 66b - but the bot doesn't close them during many days ?

Certainly could close them manually .... but at the other side the EA must do that ?

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Meanwhile here are the results/demos for

c_fix: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT_...lot-m15/928963

b: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/TGT_...-m15-gp/905637

and another c_fix: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/MAND...15-gp-2/937491

No trade closing of older trades in the b-version - is that a bug ?

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Guys please test on different brokers v2. I had different performance using 2 different brokers. One is performing better. The other one not so good.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
In using feb10cfix do you turn on long or short trades only?

nice results by the way

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Hi,

I think 66b or 66c is really better than your cccp controlled version.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
i'm here i'm here

have not check the thread. I've been messing around with the code since releasing lastest ccfp version (2.00)

so, gotta admit

I still can't surpass former b, ba and c-fix version's performance.

about the un-close issue I saw that sometime too but but cannot figure it out why that happened.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
dear fellow participants,

I have to temporary stop my posting about new and next version from now.

My previous releases after v66c is troublesome for all testers.

So anything after v66c, is somewhat full of issues.

I like v66c (and v66ba) the best, regardless of high DD.

I appreciate your participation. I'll try to do more basic testings before I post here. As you can see my explorer on the top, it's failure in there using later releases.

v66ccfp is somewhat not sure for me. ccfp indicator seems to not perform well for some broker and it was written in old mql4 version. I don't know how to convert it. I would like to have a pause moment here.

FYI, I'll be on-and-off for awhile. My boss give me 6 weeks to complete designing new assembly automated machine. (I design mechanic parts). It is no time to fix to Feb10 issue.

gotzaa

PS.

Thank you all fellow traders.

I'll be right back

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi iamgotzaa - hope you are well and well doing.

So what about supporting your EAs here ? The Feb10v66c_fix has a bug - obviously. After some time the bot doesn't close the trades anymore. Have to close them by hand - I mean they run often into wins - even high wins, but no closing ocurs excuted by the EA.

So its hard do rely on the bot.

Its a pity - all in all this bot is doing quite well - except that incorrect trade closure of winning trades.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hi DerBerliner,

I'm doing fine here.

I just don't throw this ea away. I put it aside a little bit.

I'm do little coding in my spare time. I experience same thing as you see. the EA sometime abandon the trade (I think it lose my main loop).

All I can tell is please keep watching this explorer from now on. It's looking pretty good right now.

I deploy new entry signal that I dug thru FF from mr. Wingman. it's called BoxBreakout Signals_v3. This is what I am trying to achieve in previous v66. It's an entry problem what leads to high DD.

I'll let it run for awhile to see the performance.

By the way, I have not able to figure why it abandon the order yet...

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Dude it's looking good! I read your blog too!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi iamgotzaa - could you plz post a link to that

"FF from mr. Wingman. it's called BoxBreakout Signals_v3" ?

or the indi itself ?

+ any link to the trade explorer you mentioned above ... or the blog where you post recent results obtained with the improved bot ?

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hello Folks

My 66c-fix is still pumping pipssss! Interesting to note this is a 100K acct. It does have large draw downs but has had no Stop Outs. I had two other 3K accts (now just one) that do get stop outs and they struggle in a slowly losing battle. I conclude 66cf will win if acct size supports the draw down.

I have not seen EA fail to close any trades... tho I have made minor changes to Feb and Lib. I do not recall making any changes to Trade or OA... To be sure, if you choose to D/L these you should get them all. As before when I posted changes I made, the mqh files must go in the 'Include' directory. There is no need to compile them as they will be included and compiled when Feb is compiled.

Hi iamgotzaa,

I test an indicator which can filters out most of DD.

When Yellow line above Cyanogen line, buy only. SL: Yellow line cross down Cyanogen line.

When the Yellow line below Cyanogen line, sell only. SL: Yellow line cross up Cyanogen line.

Would you please add this rule to your system?

Thanks for your great job!

Hi Derberliner

I couldn't find Wingman post (now he changed name to SwingMan)

I repost the code

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yeah I agree, if account size support it would work. Unfortunately I don't have that much capital to invest. So poor

I think 5k account should work for $0.01 and upto 10 pairs. Right Needy?

--- 帖子 #769 ---
@Needy, @Iamgotzaa

@Needy. Back-tested your 'fixed' version {Feb10v66c_f} from Post 764 on $3k account with 0.03 initial lot size and it 'lives' through draw-downs in recovery mode well.

!!! BUT >> i noticed that at some points the EA does not open new orders in recovery mode and very large draw-downs happen until market finally returns to close orders and/or equity = 0.

>> But this happens only in recovery mode when price returns and almost reaches TP level. Then it looks as if TP level shifts or locks (or something). If TP is not reached again and orders are not closed then the EA does not open any more recovery orders even if market price moves far negative. Almost as if EA locked into waiting for close of these current orders (probably gets stuck in loop).

Not familiar with the program flow enough yet to quickly find problem but you or Iamgotzaa should be able to locate problem.

@Iamgotzaa. I am impressed with the structured nature of your programming. Good stuff. Will try to help improve this project.

Ideas:

>> 1. Advanced Loss Recovery (i.e. using hedging instead of Martingale for loss recovery) # see Dustin Pass system <ForexTradersDaily.com>

Math for this is relatively simple.

>> 2. Using long term indicator (Daily) as directional bias.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Please ignore my proposal. I add the StepMA_Stoch indicator to Feb10v66ba, but volume declined significantly, the effect is not ideal.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
hi @iamgotzaa i found swing indi.take a look.its likely promising to add with yours.i found it with zup indi

--- 帖子 #772 ---
any screenshot how does it work?

here you go my friend

--- 帖子 #774 ---
yeah it try to shift lock the profit but it's bug there

--- 帖子 #775 ---
This indicator will repaint. I do not think it is a good way.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Looks OKAY now

--- 帖子 #777 ---
yes recovery trades closed the baskets GA GCHF EC in profit

Finally back from recovery,

how are things going? Which version is ready to be tested?^^

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi Guys,

I think it is okay to share with everyone for the latest version of Feb10 (v100).

This version is the one in my explorer linked to this thread.

Please do note that YOU NEED TO CLOSE THE LOSE TRADE(S) FOR SOMETIME. IF THINGS JUST DON'T GET IN YOUR WAY. This EA is stupid enough to make you loose all deposit.

If loss are too much or you notice strong trend/reversal and the positions are against it. Just close them no matter how big the loss is. Soon this Feb10 will make it up to you.

Usage:
TF15
Default setting is OK to go.

Limitation:
5-digits only (please),
NO Gold, NO JPY
And no resume.

Pairs: any but limit to above

Source code are available in the zip file attached.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi iamgotzaa,

Thanks for your hard work!

I am testing the new version. If you think this system will loss too much sometime, why not set a STOP LOSS function inside?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
frankly..

I don't know where to stop.

And

When I try to put a stop loss in using some level of ATR or MA line or some high price same TF or different TF. It make consecutive losses.

iamgotzaa,

Dude you seriously need to revisit MayDay again. Looky at these wonderful trades... MayDay didn't close them by itself, bug somewhere on it.

I closed them manually. And yes it works on GOLD!!

***to add... it works best on all the pairs I tested it on H1 instead of M15... something about its code when it looks back using the H1 candles to determine the trend, and it works!

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Thank you very much Pat for all these greats informations. Could you please re-upload MayDay EA with your sets. Thanks in advance. Have a nice day. Regards.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
nice results patmontes

which other pairs are you testing and can you share results? thanks

blam

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi guys, i would leave iamgotzaa to decide if it is fit to use MayDay again.

I use the pairs also used for Feb10 on H1  take the ride and test it on demo... it wouldn't hurt

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hello Patmontes I just wanted to say that i've beenl running FEB10v66b on demo and it's doing very well on the 15min GBPJPY  yes it gets into a bit of trouble at times but i notice it recovers very well. I'm hoping these EAs  won't be completely abandoned, Iamgotzaa has done awesome work here lets hope he continues.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hiya Folks, been busy here... OTT sucking some serious time lately (Other Than Trading)

I D/L Mayday last month but not even loaded it yet, took Feb10v100 today. Hope to load both soon.

My 66c-fix had serious problem Jul 3rd on the 100k acct but now back near high made in mid June. The 3k acct is making a come back after I reduced pairs to five. Both of these using 10c Lots and OTB settings. With judicious pair selection on a 3k acct 66c-fix might be a viable tool. I'm still not ready to commit live dollars tho...

--- 帖子 #794 ---
hi guys can anyone tell me how to set up this bot step by step on MT4 ? Thanks im new

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hi jasonhaw

I think you got a problem to put those files.

quick fix

put Feb10.mq4 in the expert folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\AGEA MetaTrader 4\MQL4\Experts"

then put those "trade" "lib" and "oa" .mq4 files

into  /inlcude/ folder e.g.

C:\Program Files (x86)\AGEA MetaTrader 4\MQL4\Include

then change the code where

#include "\Libraries\Trade.mq4"

change to

#include <Trade.mq4>

and do the rest of three files

then you should be able to compile

or

you should use already compiled program (.ex4)

put it in expert folder.

C:\Program Files (x86)\AGEA MetaTrader 4\MQL4\Experts

open MT4

goto side three explorer

>>Expert Advisors

expand it

then drag Feb10 program on the M15 chart on your selected pair.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Guys,

need to confess

Even I tested for 2 and a half weeks I still see some bug in trailing before release. This can be seen in v100 I just shared.

By the way, I think I would like to share a code+program with you guys directly since you guys still stick with this thread. I'm so glad.

Inbox me and e-mail with your nickname in FF (so I know who are you)

I will periodically send update to you directly.

In the explorer after release, I made some changes (up to v110) now it can detect a price surge & sudden drop. But those DD is from v100. This week there are so much news.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Dear Friends

As I explained on post 682 i'm running the feb10 EA in a slightly different way.

I'm giving the feb10 EA the direction from the D1 TF. There is in my opinion no way to trade on small TFs. To dangerous. Harakiri. I would never

trust a payed EA on TFs smaller than 4H.

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/bobe...0FVXQ3hGvI1cl6

GBP and Jyp Pairs are not well running with this strategy. I'm currently on testing another D1 TF or 4H TF strategy for those pairs. GBPNZD is my target to use.

But if the overall trend is clear, then the feb10 is simply a superb EA. One of the best I've ever seen in five years of experience.

One thing I consider is that there is no stoploss. On al live account I would use another EA which would cap the overall drawdown after 30%.

Second thing I consider is the behaviour on more volative markets. We heve holiday now.

The tiny trades 0.01 are from another EA. Forget about that.

I'm testing the EA live with 0.1 lots wince two weeks. I cannot see differences to the demo account until now.

Thanks iamgotzaa for your work

Currently started testing MayDay and v100 again with some more serious though innit. Will get back on daily basis to this thread. Sorry for late reply, was finishing some matters.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
anybody running v100 ?

PBPTaker ...could u sharing another ea that control dd at 30% ....

--- 帖子 #800 ---
There is nothing to share at this stage. Just attach a trend indicator to the daily TF and configure the EA on the 15 TF to trade this direction. I'm using the supply / demand indicator from PZ Trading which is not free (199$). There are also some free indicators (xsupertrend, hurt locker) which could be used.

Take care on high impact news eg FOMC NPF etc.

This is everything you need. Just the states state_revsell_tradebuy, state_revbuy_tradesell trades aren't being executed because of the common setting only buy/sell in the EA. This occured once in the last 6 weeks on E/U.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I'm learning more about risk, volatility, statistic, regression, prediction... (on youtube)

current knowledge will not get this EA very far

by the way, i'm running 66ba on demo (again)

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Is there a way to force the Expert Advisor to open only long or only short trades? My intention is to make it open orders according to the major trend direction.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Yes, it's easy, go to properties (F7) >> Common >> choose 'Only Long' or 'Only Short'

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Hi All,

I have been running 100k demo with Feb10v66c_f for the 2nd consecutive month with no problem. Running 9 pairs average return is about 3-5%  with  less than 6% drawdown.

However as you all know today we have news and price surge down quite a lot.

I am running GBPCHF, GBPUSD, GBPCAD, AUDCAD, EURCAD, EURAUD, EURNZD, GBPNZD,GBPAUD

At of this moment there're 26 position. All of them are in recovery positions. The strange thing is usually the recovery position size are 0.18,0.18,0.37,0.54,0.77,1.11 etc

Today there're random sequence of position size replaced by 0.01.

e.g  for EURAUD, currently I have 0.18,0.18,0.01,0.54,0.01,1.11

I checked the expert log. Here is the error that I think is related to this error

Invalid Lots amount for Ordersend Function.

I have limited skill for EA and couldn't find out what's wrong in the EA. The only difference compare to my past experience is I don't think I have ever seen so many position outstanding in this account.

Could any of you help?

Sai

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Hi Sai,

try replace the code, Ctrl+H

replace
Inserted Code lots=NormalizeLotSize(lots);
with
Inserted Code   lots=NormalizeDouble(lots,2);

The "invalid lots" for OrderSend function comes from too many decimal point in lots variable.

Hi guys,

Anyway, it's kinda back of my head all the time of how to make use of current feb10v66ba which is the base line for every alterations I posted.

So, current we do only market orders and it has a stupid drawback of drawn down and counter trend. In stead of jump right in the market and having position I don't want. I came up with pending orders strategy that if it comes to the state that price "may" move in either direction. I will try to catch with both buystop and sellstop order.

This code is preliminary version. It is very raw. I dump everything I can think of in this one without rearrange it.

So far with the back test, it is 11.7% drawdown (feb10v66ba was 22+%, I believe I can tune it down more with optimization but that take months of back test).

Number of trade reduce drastically but win rate keep high at 77%

I feel comfortable with this version also (even you may notice old bugs still there after feedbacks from users)

I continue to work with the code and share when I have free time.

thank you every one,

Keep it up and good pips to all.

Hello iamgotzaa

Compliments for your patience and good work.

1. What I've noticed from your robot(s) is that it looks like they cannot resume where they left in case of a restart of the MT4.

2. Once an order goes negative badly, the robots looks like it forgets about it.

Is there any news in the treatment of the above situations in the new version.

Keep up the good work.

Hello Iamgotzaa

Glad to have you back and with another great EA.

I'm still forward testing in demo the  v66bapending version and it looks very promising, and I would suggest you build on that one!

1. Pending orders (stop) do offer much grater flexibility versus executing orders on the spot, much less sensitive to slippage and connectivity issues.

if you want you can check on my trade explorer, since Sept 26th when the last version was put into testing. I'm still in demo as I'm testing the 18 pairs left that do give greater and safer output. I've been playing with several brokers and their settings and found some good settings and pairs.

From the backtesting of your feb102015 I can see that there are some blind spots for your EA, if you test it from 2009 to now, there is a moment that the EA holds an order form more than 8 months !!! just to get some small profit from it, when just the swap might have killed the account.

I'd like to have a look at the 2015 mq4 files and see how you are handling the OrderAccounting() and the relevant arrays created for such purposes, as I believe those are the weak points of your pending orders strategy.

Please trust me when I say that pending orders are the best

Wishing you all best.

Pause the EA during news event.

I know you can do. then just let it run.

Change shutdownpercent before enable the EA. I put default -1% of account balance.

I registered to FF, only for sending you my deepest respect, iamgotzaa.

Hello iamgotzaa,

whether to place files Lib.mq4, OA.mq4, Trade.mq4 theme from the beginning to the folder libraries? Or rather just put the file in the folder Feb10v66k.ex4 experts?

Really I want to try in the robot.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
The robot runs on 4 digits or only 5 digits?

If the robot is in different windows on different terminal pairs, you need to put:

UseAutoID   false

User_define_Bot_ID   1000 (1111 in another window, 1222 in another window, ...)

???

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Just put the ex4 file in this folder

C:\Program Files\___your_BROKER____MT4___\MQL4\Experts

Restart your mt4 and it is ready to use. It will be under Expert Advisors tree.

Run 5 digits. 4 Digit i'm not so sure it will perfectly function.

UseAutoID=false

User_define_Bot_ID=___your define magic number____

correct.

trailing stop loss I use the what people call wheel barrel trailing stop loss. You can google here at ff for it.

trailing stop loss function in the old code will be called as a function, "ftx()" is its name.

In the new code, I just uploaded today, trailing stop loss function is re-written to support all instruments (pairs, including JPY and GOLD, CFD--not tested). The function name is "stoplosswheelbarrel()"

If you start out with 50,000, depends on how many pairs you want to trade at the same time. I suggest 1000$/0.01lot/pair.

In this demo, 100,000$ 28pairs, 0.1 lots. I have seen about -16-20% drawdown sofar

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Thanks.

1. Your EA seems to have an error when I am trying back testing: 2015.06.19 12:04:31.582    2015.03.19 00:00  array out of range in 'Lib.mq4' (49,14)

(see screenshot).  How do I fix this?

2. You stated you uploaded a new version today but I can only see the one from a few weeks ago?

LIVE RESULT

EA: FEB10V66k

Live test on EURUSD(spread:3), EURGBP(spread:4), NZDUSD(spread:3), GBPUSD(spread:3.5)

leverage 1:200

setting with default.

The setting really matter.

need good setting.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Did u do anything manually?

--- 帖子 #850 ---
nothing

it's all automatic.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I'm not sure about your init capital. If the shutdown trigger too fast because the percentage it was set to 1% of account balance. That might be the case of too many closes in red.

If it is not the case, then it may imply as the data suggested.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Well, the reason why i asking is the drawdown he has - didn't happen for me until now. Manual interaction could be a reason..

--- 帖子 #853 ---
At some point in longer run I think it's going to happen as the system was designed....

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Well, my live result looks like this after the first week.

11 Pairs - EURUSD/GBPUSD/EURGBP/EURAUD/EURCAD/NZDUSD/AUDCAD/USDCAD/AUDUSD/EURCHF/USDCHF
Spreads below 2 on average. Shutdown trigger at 5% (250,-). Except that everything default.

The older versions of v66k still had the ticketnumber issue, so a connection loss wouldn't recover his open trades anymore and he might have closed them manually. Just guessing of course, but trying to find an answer for the difference.

Edit: just saw your reply concerning the shutdown trigger - that is another major variable influencing the whole system of course. My bad, sorry.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
OK, so also getting the same attached errors on your new version BUT look at the crazy profits on a back test (the errors are still allowing a back test to work).

Cant be that good a change!

Can I get some help on that error or a new version thanks very much?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
This error means, that the SL is too close  I'm getting the same one (with both versions 66k and 66ba).

@iamgotzaa: Is there a possibility to configure the SL trailing distance? BTW: Thanks for the EA, grat job!

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Possible the 1% need to change, I will try again increase to 5%

--- 帖子 #858 ---
I think it is because there is a limit for minimum distance from the open price you can place a stop loss. For some broker I experience 30 points or 3 pips minimum for stop loss.

So, I edit the 66k version and add user settings. See below.

markPts = if the price move in profit for xx points it will trigger trailling stoploss

movePts = once the trailing stop loss is triggerred, it will move stoploss level up by xx points

(note that unit is in Point, 1 pip =10 points)

you might need to use new 66k update.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Since you guys are following this thread and helping me revisiting this ea.

I would like to describe the what trigger the trade in v66k, please see attach powerpoint file.

Right now i'm testing v66m with the filters

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Great. Is there a methods to pause or stop your EA from making consecutive martingale style bids directly after say 4 losses in a row? Playing around it has such a nice climb but eventually blows out on a higher lot due to the consecutive losses.  I would have thought the simplest option was a forced pause after X losses, or simple stop of program after X losses.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
How should it work? The recovery system is part of the stratey and crucial for the steady profits. To "move" the breakevenpoint into a reasonable position, i think u need a small martingale increase of lot after some recovery trades. Otherwise it wouldnt work. However, there is the shutdown, to prevent you from massive losses in extreme market situations. It's all about the question how often the market gets into these strong trending situations.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Except GBPUSD other pairs spread is very high. dont you think abut it?

--- 帖子 #863 ---
oh there is some reply to this thread

hello there

Current working version, tested secretly is version 66ke (I don't upload it).

Just wanna check whether some one want to test it.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
yes, can I please test and can u give set files to give idea

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Hi there,

Am ready to test it too. And I must commend you for the great job you have done in this awesome project.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi iamgotzaa,

I have observed that most pairs are often trending quite strongly nowadays, could you add the option of reversing the signal so that it sells when price moves to a low (instead of buying), and buys when on a high? Or maybe when the daily or 4hr trend is bullish, only buy and vice versa..

Then, you could also add the option of closing the oldest order if a certain number of orders are open, so as to further reduce the retrace distance needed to close the recovery orders and also manage the drawdown.. (Once the oldest order is closed, recalculate the new TP point for the remaining orders).

Also, you can add the feature of limiting the lotsize that can be opened for the recovery orders to prevent extra large lots from being opened.

Lastly, I think it would be fine if the EA could treat the Buying or Selling decisions autonomously, such that for instance even if it has some open buys, it can still open a sell if the conditions get right for a sell.

Thanks again for your time.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
here it is

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Hi colyske, thank you for joining my thread. I use ema200 on M15, for buy and sell restriction. But for larger timeframe I had attempted some test like you said, most of the time it blew account away because of trend reversal.

I'm considering to test this. I have this thought for a while.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Hi yadgayan,

I think it is vary broker by broker. For crosses pairs whipsaw are pretty high and swift.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
you got it please come and download

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Do you have tested set file for ke version?

--- 帖子 #872 ---
By the nature of the EA, there is no "perfectly" testet set file at the moment. It is all about a risk/reward ratio. There's no free lunch.

You could start using the default values and make up your mind about the values, which might fit best in your humble opinion. Put them to discussion afterwards.

Especially the shutdown value (i advise something between 5% and 30%), the distance gap and the gaphour setting.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
i tested several way and identified there is a settings. but time to time it need to change, since market reverse unexpectedly. that time we need to alter wit ea and chnage settings. if anyone can do that thing, without any issue  that person can with with this ea. Im doing forward testing for this month and I will let you the result.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Put it on M15 chart, don't forget.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I got error but ea do the trading. Why I get error like this?

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Here Recovery order count not go more than 3 . Why is that? is there setting for that?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Could you run attached script on the pair you had run the ea?

And capture the expert log's tab for me.

There is a different for STOP LEVEL which means minimum points that server allow you to put a stop loss level from the open price.

Mine is zero. Therefore there is no problem putting stop level very close to the open price.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
no happens here.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
For those of you that has downloaded v66ke.

Here is the settings explanation.

UseAutoID true, give you auto create magic number, false will use below variable
User_define_Bot_ID (put any number)
UserDefine_SpreadTooHigh (it shall not place any order unless spread is below this points, def=60 points)
init_lot_size (your starting lot size, of course this is fix size)
exponent (def=1.44, why? don't ask. It will increase lot size and you keep losing)
squeeze_factor (DISABLE, def=0.3, this input is disable. So just ignore it. It design to add 0.3xATR pips to your breakeven in recovery mode)
atr_range (hours to calculate ATR)
candles_range (DISABLE)
Calm_candles (def=8, how many m15 candles to measure the range)
Calm_range (def=200 points, lower this value would increase number of trades as the ea will work on tight trading range. Range calculate from Calm_candles must more than this number for ea to start)
D1_atr_range (DISABLE)
HoldMinutes (minutes, how long it pause after closing live order to make next order. def=60 minutes)
High_Or_Low_Diff (def=40, for trigger recovery trade when this bar's low is more than previous bar, or bar's high is lower than previous bar by 40 points)
ShutDownPercent (def=5%, try changing this larger so it has room to breath, depends on your starting lot size and how many pair you have run. Note that it calculate total account losses not just one pair)

markPts and movePts (both are used in stoplosswheelbarrel() function. Concept to to move stop up by "movePts" when gained by "markPts".

for e.g. I set markPts =50 points and movePts = 10 points. It means that I shall move stop up by 10 pts for every 50 pts profit.)

mindistanceRecov (def=200, in order to get recovery order. Loss must be more than this number)
multiplierX (starting from multiplier3-multiplier10, this is multiplier for "mindistanceRecov" when the averaging orders is more than or equal to X number, your

minimum distance [of losses] must more than multiplierX x mindistanceRecov

e.g. I'm at recovery order number 4 (total 4 orders)

my multiplier4=1.6 and my mindistanceRecov=200

so, in order to get another recovery order, the market must move against my positions more than

1.6x200=320 points at least)

by the way, I use default settings.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
you mean put that file in to script folder then drag and drop to chart after that capture expert tab?

--- 帖子 #881 ---
there market stop level is not 0.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
It's a broker related issue - which one r u using?

Don't have any issues too.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
I have to correct myself.

this stop level point. Mean that you cannot put stop level closer to "current market price" than 40 point.

Therefore, your markPts and movePts difference should be more than 40 points e.g. set mark to 50 pts and move to 5 pts, (50-5=45) leave 5 for slippage. (45-5=40). This will reduce the error.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
got your point.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
i try with roboforex and aaafx. which one you recommended?

--- 帖子 #886 ---
in very 1st you recommended  below pairs.

EURAUD ,EURCAD, EURNZD, EURCHF, GBPNZD, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF,GBPUSD

But the problems is some pairs spread is very high like 10 pis or more. But in the EA spread is 6. So do you believe spread is not a matter here?

--- 帖子 #887 ---
don't forget to check your Magic number... that's only my recommendation because I think I don't put auto-generate for all pair.

And that need to be fixed later.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
once i set autoid = true then is there any issue? since UseAutoID true, give you auto create magic number

--- 帖子 #889 ---
it does not give for all pairs, that's a problem

--- 帖子 #890 ---
So better give roboid for all pairs. is that your recommendation ?

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Do you really think, that there are pairs out, following your wishes coded into an EA ?

Any pair could + will do unexpected movements !! You never know .... !!!

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Generally agree - however within a specific timeframe some pairs might offer a higher volatility than others which affects the performance of the robot. Always a risk/reward issue.

It is not about generally avoid unexpected movements (as the EA can deal with it).

--- 帖子 #893 ---
I'm in. Thank you for the ea!

Hi IAMGOTZAA,

I think i have a good idea. Can you add 'time filter' in the 'FEB10v8A'. in that sense EA trades a certain prescribed time to avoid over trading.

Or you add the a 'number trades to trade a day' filter .

I think this will help a lot.

iamgotozaa,

which currency pair/s do you recommend for EA Feb10v8B?

st888

--- 帖子 #963 ---
I recommend GU GBP cross pairs base on my experience that it "swing" pretty good during london session.

(see here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...66#post8689066)

Heart of forex.

Others would be GBP crosses pair. NZD AUD CAD tends to be trending with less movement compare to others. And serveral weeks oil plunged so those pairs will tend to move only in one direction.

Bottom line. This EA tend to perform very well when sideways.

Hi Iamgotzaa,

I have found a bug in 'Feb10v80a'... it delays in opening trade when the position is losing. Is it part of the logic in the system or .....?

Just want to know because any time i restart the platform, any losing position on a pair that hasn't opened any counter position yet will immediately open a trade when the platform resume form restarting. Is it normal?

I hope i have explain well for you to understand.

thanks..

--- 帖子 #977 ---
it delay 10 hours and loss must more than certain distance.

if you reopen the ea, it does not know when is the last time it traded. So default is setting back 24 hours assumed for last trade. Therefore, if loss exceed the limit and consider the fact above, it will open another trade because conditions are met.

seems to be more work

hmm..but mine still holding. Any idea?

--- 帖子 #986 ---
That is also possible. Today retracement is still far from last Friday's shear drop on GU. Depends on where is the break even level is for your pair.

From back testing it could stay red for a month if trending continue. Exit strategy? May need to close oldest trade position to move portfolio break even level closer to market price. I have 80B running and it now holding GU for three weeks now losing about 300pips but only 3-4 positions.

Btw Rosey account has no GU and GJ expose to lose balance.

ok done thank you ... another question... i can't work on 80B ??

I assume you are a complete newbie

back test does not show your trade entry in the Trade tab. It's a back testing. Not real trade.

Hi,

You should go here http://screencast.com/t/oD5qUnCEbf4J then place the file to the ../MQL4/Expert folder.

Hi Iamgotzaa,

I noticed after the recovering process break even pip still holding some negative value e.g -1.00 or -0.11

For example;

-8.44 (DD)

7.93 (Recover)

Is this expected or we still can tweak the break even pips?

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
yes that can be tuned.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
addition to mgc,

you put .ex4 file in the installation folder which mt4 will not be using it anymore.

you need to go thru "data folder" , go to file>open data folder menu

then it would pop up file xplorer like this one.

then you copy my ea in the the experts folder.

including other files like indicator

go back to mt4, feel free to restart it. or refresh it

then you will be able to run it

thx mgc

Hi,

Since Rosey has got version 80A running and come up with successful trade result.

The problem with 80A is high CPU consuming.

So I make some code optimization on 80A now version 80A1

I also add some buttons for user to easily adjust their init_start_lot (click + or minus and it show below)

and also purge button to clear all order in case you want to cut losses.

Good Luck

Hi iamgotzaa,

May I know what is the main difference between 80B and 80A in term of strategy?

Regards,

MGC

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
hi mgc, glad you curious to ask.

80A came early in the development. It is designed for counter trade, intra day, martingale-base recovery strategy. It assume that the price trend is in side way movement. Therefore it does not care whether price move up or down. All it does is to enter counter trade position. Price move up, sell. Price move down, buy. Then the mechanism of recovery or take profit kick in using Quantum box (second pic).

Very simple, first box if red->sell, if blue->buy. Each currency might match with different Quantum input number depends on its volatility. I use 200 for all.

80B, which is trend bias. Everything is the same with 80A but it has a guiding. A Guide is from one indicator I am a fan of it. It is CCFp indicator (AKA cluster indicator or relative strength indicator, similar to strength indicator or dashboard's strength value). So as this ea design to run on M15 so the dominant time frame is H1, H4 or D1. For 80B, I select H1 as a trend direction.

Now I take a value of each currency, calculate a slope, or speed then compare which one is higher that currency is going up or tend to move up, long bias. On the other hand if the speed of CCFp line is negative or decreasing, that currency will be short bias. Note that I use slope not the value.

If the calculated bias is sell, it will only sell when price match sell condition, or swing up. It will not follow trade when price move down.

If the bias is to buy, it will buy only price dip not pushing up.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Hi iamgotzaa,

Is it possible to add filter high impact news from forexfactory in your 80A ea?

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Hi Iamgotzza,

Appreciate your detailed explanation.

Do I need to select H1 time frame when running the EA? Also, need to include the Quantum indicator in order for the EA to work?

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
i think 80A is both trend bias and reversal also. i have been monitoring it closely. it still need more room for improvement. Its best for GBP crosses. Gold looks promising but scary

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
No need, it runs on M15, H1 is hard coded.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I have tried to do it for a while last year but not success, need more time to work on it. Since it is mql4, if it is mql5 then it can be more easier with OOP.

Hi Iamgotzaa, I have begun using 80A1 and  i think you have done a good job with the processor usage. Very impressive. (very low usage)

I only want you to explain the STATE=1000 that appears at the bottom of the chart. What does that mean please?

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
the structure of this program is written using state machine. Like in modern software.

for example

when I dont' have any position, my state =0

if I think I will buy, I change my state =500

I'm placing buy my state=501

my order is placed, and live. my state=1000

if i'm losing and I'm placing next order mystate=5000

just to illustrate here. This way I can avoid too complicate conditon statement using "if"

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
something went wrong... the EA placed another trade with short distance. In the picture you will realize that the EA opened a third position just closed to the second the position. normal?

--- 帖子 #1036 ---

The problem with compilation of the 80A1 is probably lack of one of the includes, during compilation process there were not defined functions:
'ButtonCreate' - function not defined
'PercentileSafetyLevel' - function not defined
'RectLabelCreate' - function not defined

'RectLabelCreate' - function not defined
'pips' - function not defined

iamgotzaa is there any "include.mql"???, which contains these functions above?

These includes/libraries were added during the compilation: 'LastOrder.mqh', 'Trade.mq4', 'OA.mq4', 'EAHeader.mqh', 'SmallFunc.mqh', 'MQL4OBJ.mqh', are there any others need to have?

Hey, i'm struggling with an error 'OrderSend error 131' when i try to use the tester with a lot of 0.01, but if i choose 0.1 on the lot it works.

Tried the default MT4 demo account with a leverage of 100, and another demo account, i get the same issue...

Don't know if this could be of any clue on how to fix it maybe? https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/67708

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
is this article below related to my post above?

http://ovo.cz/metatrader-4-build-880...e-workarround/

So it seems that MT4 since build 880 throws that error? anybody using the tester + a new build like the 950?

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
I get that too. 0.01 does not work but 0.1.

So I change broker for demo.

Hi ROsey,

I saw the trade that being place in close trade range to to first entry. Do you think that's bothering you?

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Ok, ty for the reply iamgotzaa, so i should be looking for another broker to use the 0.01 lot size?

Currently i only had success with back testing with a 0.1 lot size (still new to MT4)

On forward testing (demo) i started 7 hours ago, with EURUSD,M15 + GBPUSD,M15 + AUDNZD,M15 + AUDUSD,M15 + GBPJPY,M15 + GBPCHF,M15, not a single order got opened so far... i even threw the quantum indicator manually just to see what's going on with the charts.

The only info showing up is >>I>>%loss= 0.00%, >>I>>waiting for signal.. >>I>>processing time=0.00ms

I read the topics posted before me, someone had the same issue, but his fix was that he forgot to set the 'Autotrading' option, he had a frowning emoji at the top, but i have a smiling emoji there from the start, i made sure to tick autotrading button, and checked options to set them for live trading.

- Just for debuging purpose, which build of MT4 are you using please? mine is MT4 build 950, with Feb10v80B.

- If you could please tell me about an example of working broker demo server? used NoorCM demo + FinFX demo so far...

Any clue from the screenshot posted of what might be wrong?

Edit: Another question please, is it intended for the orders to ignore defining an SL? (from the back tester result, you can see no Stop Loss defined)

Edit2: 2 things noticed while fiddling with stuff, i used Feb10v80A1 with a lot size of 0.1 and the orders started popping up... when i did try 0.01 it didn't work, also Feb10v80B isn't working with either of the lot size settings on front testing... i'm still leaving them open, just to see if they would decide to start, but i'm sure something is wrong with that release, or MT4 build 950 is not that compatible, last thing to try is another demo server...

--- 帖子 #1100 ---

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
to see the action, I put 28 pairs and trade at the same time. Then you will see a lot of actions.

EU and GU may be 1-3 trades per day depends on market swing.

The trigger is this.

Price on m15, need some move until the program can count more than 5 bar of blue boxes or red boxes from Quantum indicator (bar=15) and then start to work.

if bars with blue box are more than 5 out of 32 bars back, then groupbuy is true

if bars with red box are more than 5 out of 32 bars back, then groupsell is true

then must satisfied

groupbuy && !groupsell condition for BUY

groupsell && !groupbuy condition for SELL

if you can open up the mq4 file.

Try to remove "&& !groupsell " and "&& !groupbuy " and recompile. Order shall be sent easier.

Or adjust tf in the iCustom function from PERIOD_M15 to PERIOD_M5 or M1

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
Sometimes is scary when it does that but it fine. A little bug wouldn't spoil the party But please Iamgotzaa i think adding TIME FILTER will make it system very profitable and less risky. Becasue like this week i had to purge my account because of the Brexit stuff was crazy since i was in a trade on Friday and the weekend gap catch me off guard. So i think adding time filter might help avoid over trading and prevent weekend gaps and also avoid over OVERSOLD and OVERBOUGHT areas .

Hope you understand. I bet you this system is the real deal. I love it

Thank you and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
hey iamgotzaa,

Thanks for your reply and recommendations, i earlier tried Oanda servers, demo account (not the best, but at least i don't get any errors with 0.01 lots)

I wanted to post my journal but unfortunately i closed the app earlier and restarted it, the logs were discarded, just to see if the trade keeps going after a quick close and restart, or after a disconnection...

I'll do another journal and if i keep having issues with a version i'll post the journal as text file.

Now on the updates, from what understand through forward and backward testings, the version 80A1 starts making buy/sell orders from seconds to mostly an hour at most, while the 80B version takes a long time to start, it's like if the 80A1 analyses the previous chart, while the 80B needs hours to analyse and get from a state to another...

Attached to the post are the results of strategy testing 80A1 + 80B, using EURUSD between 1st february till the 24th of this year with a lot size of 0.1, you'll notice the 80A1 version starts at midnight 00:00, while the 80B version starts until 09:00 (nine hours later), that alone makes a lot of people dread about the system if it is working or not

I also left EURUSD + GBPUSD + AUDNZD + GBPJPY for 20 hours (80B) and none started except one AUDUSD after at least 12 hours (sorry for the lack of journal)

Now by curiousity wanted to test the 80A1 version with some other pairs, and boom, all started withing minutes of putting the EA on chart...

One other thing that i still wish to grasp are the catastrophic draw downs that happens if i use the date from 1st january this year until today with version 80A1, with a setting of M15 of course + 0.01 lot size + 1000$ initial deposit = blows up the balance 12 days from the start with this error in journal :

Inserted Code 2016.02.25 03:38:50.039 2016.01.12 05:53 Tester: order #5 is closed

What i see from order results, is that the size of the lot is increasing from 0.01 to 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and so on, the problem is that the size is increasing while new orders are opened, if only the lot size could increase only after one of the orders gets closed, and the balance is refreshed with a newer amount, if there is profit it increases, otherwise adjusts it's value compared to initial deposit, (just my opinion, i'm not sure how your algorithm works, maybe i'm wrong in the way things should work), but this usually is leading to massive draw downs from i see on logs.

Thank you for this great EA, it is really impressive to see what can be achieved with such bots

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
hi fellow friends,

I have to apologize. It seems like 80A1 got real problem.

from the picture below that should not happen. I didn't really check this. it looks like it does open a trade and then a few seconds close it. and repeat.

yes i am aware of that problem. i thought i was a style used by the EA if it wants to start looking for reversal trade. But if you say its a bug then am hoping you will be fixing it. PLease once again do not forget about the TIME FILTERS, very important

And no need to be sorry. The work you are doing here is priceless. And most appreciated.

wow great stuff looks good

i remember sucessfully trialling a previous version  feb10v66b EA in early 2015 (its in my trade demo diary) and it did well over a couple of months but for some reason i discontinued demoing. will load this up when i get home thanks iamgotzaaa

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Hi everyone, please can someone explain to me how to get this EA to start trading? I have downloaded and added all the files in their respective folders (Feb10v80A2_released to MQL4\Experts and the rest in MQL4\Include). Till now, it has not opened even one trade in the demo account I am testing it.

Someone please direct me. Thanks in advance.

Imagotzaa, can you please explain what's the reasoning for the Recovery Mode?

It looks dangerous:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Is there another protection apart from the 5%?

5% is of account balance?

What you think about an input to shut down just a pair? (if pair loss > x% close pair)

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Notes:

- lost more than the defined 5% without shutting down

- continued to try to open trades (several per minute) without margin

Test #1: stopped at FridayCloseHour:

how will the time function works?

follow the server time or the local time?

Hi Iamgotzaa, hope you good?

i have got another idea.. very simple.

Can you please make the EA place buy and sell at the same time. eg. when the signal is buy and the buy is losing and it happens that a sell signal is activated then EA should place a sell position along with buy position while it manages both the long and short position simultaneously. More like hedging trades to reduce DD.

Hope you understanding. i have been running for a while and it looks good.

Thanks in advance

Hi, thanks for your hard work. Can you please update the first page offering download link as new version published? and also, please write the details of which file into which folder.

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Never mind, I got it!

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Hello

Could you post your settings please?

tx

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
You can simply run two instances of desire charts. Then in the settings set AutoId to false and input manual magic number of both ea to be different.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
yes that is what i am doing. But it means more pc resource usage.

Iamgotzaa: can you please correct the ShutDownPercent? As you can see with a setting of 5% it went to more than 27%

want to share my trading experience using fundamental analyses & custer trading.

here cluster ind nice indicator but quantum entry is technical not fundamental.

In end of december 2015 : as you can see in the picture attached  i started to short the GBPJPY pair because of  brexit looming & deflation fear (strengthen JPY).

giving the fact that GBP was the strongest and the most overvalued & JPY was the cheapest.

i also used to short GBP/USD in all of my accounts.

Fundamental+ overvalued => reversion to the mean ???

i cant remember well how much pips i made across several account but it was very very much pips because i was adding on weekly basis and uses rolling profit to leverage up more

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
so my two cents for iamgotzaa. how does cluster compare to index of currency ?

why not shorting the top  currency and long the lowest currency  and re balance on weekly base. an try to be flat before NFP => end of the week for USD. paire.

one bad NFP doesn't change trend but a series 2-3 can change a trend.

Whitening more the top paire further away from Zero on vertical cal of the cluster ind.

Avoid using too mutch of paire you basically adding more risk because paire GBP & USD were correlated for the most part of 2015 before they started to brook away

currency cycle around dollar either very correlated or low to inverted correlation to the usd.

How is it going guys?

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
Hi Gotzaa,

Just had to join to congratulate you on what appears to be a profitable EA. I have only had it running 12 hours and my $2500 demo account is up $200 on 0.1 lot sizes on 6 GBP base pairs, and that was after i manually closed 3 negative positions and lost nearly $100.

I was wondering if you could answer a couple of questions for me

Can you please tell me which is the latest version of the EA. the first page says v80B, but there are posts more recently with v80A1 and v80A2 and i can't tell which is the one i should be using. So far it seems to me that v66c_f is working the best. I am a programmer (although not used MQL before) so i may be able to contribute to the code if i know which is the latest version you are working from.

Also, in v80B there is a parameter ENCisACrime. Can you please tell me what this parameter does?

Thanks very much.

Hello guys i am new here can some one guide me which EA file i have to use i am using mt4 because there are to many files so im confused  iamgotzaa can u guide me plz

@iamgotzaa: another interesting thing i've found....

I've running a mix of pairs with v66c-fixed and since a few Days XAUUSD also - but with v66ke !

All Pairs have an own BotID - no autot Ids enabled.

The Last Days i can see a lot of negative trades who reduces my account... but found no reason why this trades are closed...

Today i've found it - the v66ke - closes my trades for other pairs!

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
i re-read the whole thread

one more time

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
OK bro !

Nice to see you re-reading your own thread - the whole thread even !

So what are the results of your amazing re-reading ?

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
I look at the old code I posted.

thinking whether or not to post upgraded one... or just keep myself and show the awesome explorer later LOL

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Those of us that were actively testing your EA would like continue to do so with the new version.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
I will like to test the new version. Please let us know the settings you are using to achieve the awesome result in your explorer.

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
haha

sure i'll share

but let me first tested alpha version for this year a while

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Maybe we could test along with you. I suppose that's the essence of the testing. So that people can tell you of any bugs they may or may not find in the EA.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
I just wanna make sure it is 'at least' profiting to some extend

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
Thats OK. I hope your testing wont take too long

"feb10 v66_cfx"Fellowship release only here!!Huray!
Chart Time Frame : M15 (only)Broker : 5 digits ONLYPairs: AllMust allow WebRequest to : http://www.forexfactory.com/ffcal_week_this.xml(see attached picture)

So far, I try all pairs.I check trailing stop loss that it works.
This ea has news filter. I enable only 'high impact' or 'RED' news.It will pause the entry 6 hours before news event time.It will pause the entry 4 hours after news event time.Those are not for user input settings.
Server time which differ between broker to broker. It will impact the news shown on the chart's comment.I don't check the correctness of news time for each event.news time may offset from actual event by -1h, 1h or 2h.If more than this, please let me know.
Thank you all traders for testing.!Hope it is beneficial to you all.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Thanks for this version iamgotzaa. Testing commenced... Will give feedback soon.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
awesome. suddenly drawdown decreasing very significant after  news filter added.

i'll share my FT result after 1 week.

thanks for your effort, iamgotzaa!

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
hi iamgotzaa,

i do a backtest for this year in EURUSD, TF 1M15, standard setting with lot size 0.1, init deposit 1000 USD, but then get MC.

attached. what do you think?

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
What happens when you change the risk profile to something more in line with best practices? Such as .01 lots per 10,000.

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
seems to be bad idea for extreme lot size.

I'll fix this.

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
so next version will bemartingale same as before, with exponent number you select default is 1.44 it will not open more pair than "X" number you have set. e.g. if they are running live on eu ej au and nu total 4 pair, and you set maximum pair to 4 then the rest of the ea instances would do nothing until they have cleared those orders out.

Idea:Run two instances (different magic number)One is Long only One is Short only  Entry rule must be overlapped for Long and Short.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
traditional double lot or fraction increment is quite good for lower dd.

I just want to try something special in that _cf release. But turn to be worst idea ever.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
As I mentioned above. It is failed idea.

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
here is the update.

Fix the extremely large lot size

fix active pair to 4 pairs including manually traded orders

In the setting if you enable LongShortOnly then Magic number will be added +1 e.g.

normal is 170000 then if LongShortOnly enabled then it will be 170001

Use normal one for either short or long the another one for opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
excellent work last night

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
I suggest you use 0.1 * ATR(50days) as starting TP, it will give a much better result.

GBP will have 18pips while EUR AUD have 7-8 pips.

just give it a try, you will be surprised!

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Noted

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
Besides that, Your martingale EA is quite good. increase the lost size and grid step at the same time is quite smart!

Could you pls. explain how it works? So people here may help to improve it!

This EA should have a proper name, how about "Super Roach"? cause it's really hard to be killed by markets lol.......

There are big room for improvement on profit side, as you see $570 DD trade for $127 profit is not worth.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I have 2 solutions for it, may be could work...

1 from the NO.2 BUY or SELL orders, start counter trading.

For e.x., in the picture from NO.2 BUY,  sell function started. From NO.2 SELL, buy function started.

2 Increase TP for all orders, this will increase DD as a side effect.

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
what version you are using?

It is different a little bit from each other.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
1.1

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
ok.

but don't get excited about the profit in backtest. It is different book from real live forward test.

--may the money management be with you.

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
Could u tell me how does you EA work on TP functions?

First trade 0.01 lot TP, =10 pips

next trade 0.02 lot TP=??

XXXXXX 0.03 lot TP=??

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Hello imgotzaa, im trying your ea "Feb10v66c_fx"and think it will be a better ea if it can have a function to set sl. I notice that every time the ea triggered Martingale, it would lose a lot of trading opportunities during this period, and i consider any ea which has Martingale component will always have the risk of ruin. So i think whether it will have less risk when it is working if it has a sl at the previous pressure/support position and get rid of the component of Martingale. After all, i really appreciate your Feb10v66c_fx, it works good most of the time.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
That's why i suggest from NO.2 order, start counter trading...so many pips can be caught during recovery time.

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
hi

update v66d fx 1.1 Remove news filter to outside ea. So each instance require little CPU load and reduce poling for news.News filter is 6 before, 4 after, high impact news. All currency  Live pair filter, when live pair reach, it won't trade. Suggest settingExponent 2.00 Live pair 4-8 (depends on capital)

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
Hi,

The EA has very good survive ability but the profitability is not that good.

Could you pls. give me one try on your EA?

The real problem is the first order:

1 removed the TP for first order

2 Close BUY when RSI(M15, shift 0) > 75 followed by a bearish candle (closed) for first BUY order

3 Close SELL when RSI(M15, shift 0) < 25 followed by a Bullish candle (closed) for first SELL order

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Hi Iamgotzaa, do you have an EA that trade line corss in CCFP with TP and SL ?

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Persia, i'd like to know if you still trading hedging as per cash4u strategy on the tread in 2011. I've been trying to inbox you but i can't please let me know. my email is { email address deleted by staff }. thanks

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
thank iamgotzaa for your update EA

i will test it and comment later

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Hi, there! May i ask, do you have any martingale EA in mq4 file? I'm finding martingale code..

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
i tested an older version of this a couple of years back with good results. Any updates from anybody currently testing?

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
HI, I am new to Forex trading, I am interested in automated trading.

I am looking to try to use your auto trader.  Do you have a website with additional information?

Thanks
