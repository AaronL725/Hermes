Dear all traders, I have been asked in a few chat rooms what strategy do i use for swing trades. Therefore i decided to share this strategy of mine to anyone who is interested. Average 300-400 pips a month. Things you need: 1) Daily Chart on GBP/USD 2) 4 hours Chart on GBP/USD 3) Slow Stochatics (13,5,5) on both charts 4) EMA 4, EMA13, EMA50 on the 4 hours chart Look at 4 hours chart Entry: When the EMA4 first cross the EMA50 follow by EMA13 cross the EMA50, with a new open candle, place your entry with a stop loss of 50pips. Exit : When EMA4 reverse and cross the EMA13 on the next open candle. They call this the NoBrainersTrade but i have modified a few things and add in a really good filter base on the daily charts with slow stochastics. For Filter look at Daily chart Valid Long Entry: Slow %K above Slow %D on the Daily Chart Valid Short Entry: Slow %D above Slow %K on the Daily Chart Very simple method but yet powerful. It works on other pairs too but i found this work best on GBP/USD. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Set this up real quick on a 4hr/40 day.....seems like a very strong method. Does the filter do a sufficient job to keep you out of sideways markets in your experience? I will do some backtesting as well. Thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Looks great on both charts. Thanks and many pips!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Tx for sharing this, I set this up and looks like we might get a SHORT-GDP on the next candle. Am I correct? http://img2.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/56c911f9e7.jpg

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Neat system Haven't backtested it, but looks simple to work. Why do you have the slow stoch on 4 hr chart? Can't see where you use it

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I saw this too and opened a position at the opening of the candle which does appear just after the crossing of the EMAs, and currently am up. Though the price may rebound at the double zero so I am unsure if I should take profit or continue as per this system.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi fellow traders, Thank you all for your interest in this swing trade system. I was a little busy just now trading my sweet little cable. Caught +27 +50 +50 = +127 pips today. I'll try to answer a few questions here now. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Dear learningtheropes, i have been using this swing trade setup live since June 2006. i only kept track the pips gain for 4 months and i stopped keeping track of it after that since im very sure this is a profitable system. June2006 GBP/USD +202pips July 2006 GBP/USD +169pips Aug 2006 GBP/USD +389pips Sep 2006 GBP/USD +306pips The Daily Chart Stochastics can really filter those bad trades during sideway market. I am currently using this system as my swing trades and other method for short term trades and i'm acumulating avg 600-1000 pips a month just on cable. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Dear FX618, Yes this is a valid short as long as the PKS crosses on the daily chart when next candle opens. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Dear NKE, The stoch on the 4 hours chart just gives me a better view on the price for oversold and overbought situation. You might then want to exit before the EMA4 and EMA13 crosses. One could take profit at any S/R point. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Dear Zamakhtar, This appear to be a very good setup. But if you see a sharper angle and the EMA4 and EMA13 cosses the EMA50 at about the same time and opens at a wider angle, that is the best case senario. Im currently profiting from the current trade too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #12 ---
hey vynner, thanks for sharing your method. what was your biggest row of losing trades?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Dear FXFreak, Seriously speaking, most of the time the 50pips stops loss is hardly hit, the most you will get -10 or -20 as you would already exit when the EMA4 and EMA13 crosses back. With this system, i lose very little and gain alot therefore not a bad risk reward system. Hope you know what i mean. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #14 ---
thank you, this is what i wanted to know and this is what i like ;-) your entry for short today is 1,9515. is that correct? you wrote that we need a the stochastics also in the 4h-chart. why? which method do you use for short term trades? enjoy the day :-)

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi VyNNer, A really interesting system, thanks for sharing this with us. I've just got one question for you - the EMA's are the applied to the close? Many thanks Jilly

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I'll be back testing this system this month, I would like to know how many signals you see per month and how many you trade out of those you see. Thank you once again for sharing your system, so far 1/1 wins

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Dear FXFreak, My Short entry for today was 1.9557 and its +111 pips open at thie moment. What a good day to start this thread this way. Hope some of you got the profit too. It is not necessary to wait for the EMA4 and EMA13 cross to exit. One could try to exit at good Support or Ressitance level. But believe me, ive tried sticking to my rule, there was once a trade i got +530pips in one single trade. Regarding the stochs on 4hours please refer to the previous post that ive replied. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Dear JillyB, Yes EMAs are applied to close. You are welcome. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi VyNNER , Nice thread and method. Could I ask, -How many trades a week, a month do you expect on average? -Do you trade a routine number of hours or a session, a day? How many hours a day do you trade? -What is the usual trade length time, 2,4,8 etc hrs? -Do you scale-in and scale-out of trades, and if so, how do you that? Regards Jon

--- 帖子 #20 ---
About " 3) Slow Stochatics (13,5,5) on both charts" I am using mt4 chart. Doesn't seem to have slow stochastic? It is stochastic oscillator in mt4. Available options are %k,%d,slowing...(5,5,13)? not sure whether stoch applies to exponential, linear weighted, simple or smoothed? hmm or maybe this is a totally different indicator?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Dear Anthonybaker, With this Swing trade system, u could expect 3-8 trades a month only. That is also the reason why im using other tools to help me trade short term. I have 3 accounts in hand at the moment. One for Swing Trades, One for Short Term and One for Scalping. It all adds up to good pips every month. With this Swing trade system, you do not need to stick to the screen, you just have to check every 4 hours. I myself trade mostly during the UK and US session. Not enough sleep VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Thats good, one to two trades a week

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I am confused on this entry as well. I see 1.9515 as the opening of the candle when it crossed. How did you enter at 1.9557? According to the rules&gt; When the EMA4 first cross the EMA50 follow by EMA13 cross the EMA50. The ema 13 crossed the 50 at the 12:00 bar on my chart

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hey VyNNer! Thanks again for sharing and being so generous with answering all the question so quickly! I too am confused on what gave you the entry signal at 1.9557??? Please educate me here? Was it based on the close of the 4:00 AM EST candle close? At that time, my charts do not show EMA 13 successfully crossing EMA 50 quite yet......although it certainly looked like it was well on the way. Mind sharing your thought process a little further? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hello Every one I am new to this forum. Is PKS Stokastics slow?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Any chance of someone having the indicators set up already and able to post them as an mt4 or ea?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Dear all trader, I am currently trading on GFT Dealbook. I belive there is a diffrent between the time a new candle open on MT4 and Dealbook. Below is my chart on Dealbook GFT VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #28 ---
dear vynner, as you wrote on first post, if the slow stochastic on daily chart showing %K above %D, it means a valid Long Signal. Above picture(daily chart) showing that %K(black line) is above the %D(the yellow line). How could it be a short signal?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
ganesi, it depends on the broker's data feed. Obviously, vynner's broker shows %k lower than %d and he enters the short trade...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi, looks very interesting. The trades run overnight ? Or only one day? Because at night you cannot look every 4h to chart. Maybee a stupid question sorry. Mobsie

--- 帖子 #31 ---
caventou, the difference between any broker will not affect so much. there's may be 1-2 pips difference, but what shown by vynner's dealbook picture is not a daily chart, that is 4hours chart. my question is about the rule related to daily chart

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Vy, Sounds like a great strategy,any chance of showing a chart of the above trades entry/exits. cheers

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Wat way to start new thread thanks keep going still long way to go................All the best............thanks agian for sharing

--- 帖子 #34 ---
It is true that the difference between the data feeds of brokers is not more than a few pips at any given time; but the point is that daily bars close at different times on the brokers' platforms: some close at 22:00, some at 23:00 and others at 24:00 GMT, the same applies to 4hr bars, therefore while your 4hr bar opens at 8:00 am GMT for instance, somebody else's bar may have already opened at 7:00 GMT causing a big difference between your entry and his or her entry levels

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Dear Howard, I believe different broker's platform will have their open candle at different time bacause i use both MT4 North Finance and Dealbook GFT. They both open their candle at different hours. So far i have been using Dealbook with successful pips with this strategy. The open candles are at 0000,0400,0800,1200,1600,2000 (GMT +8) Hope this clarify some doubts. Anyway the market is still looking good for our short from 1.9557 .. It's at 1.9422 now = +135pips VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Dear all traders, What a good way to start this thread. Hope some of you got the profit as i started this thread. I'm currently +200 pips now VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi all, Wow, just to update. Im currently about +350 pips open. But dont get over excited as this strategy dont always give this good results. Normally it will range between +100 to +150 pips profit per trade. And only a few signals a month. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #38 ---
No charts?????????????

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Dear FOURX, I have already included my chart and it clearly shows my entry at 1.9557. Please refer to my previous post. By the way this trade is about +270 pips at the moment. Now waiting for the EMA4 and EMA13 to cross again. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #40 ---
i also use dealbook and based on your entry doesnt the 13 have to cross the 50 also before entry can be taken well that candle it didtn the next candle should have been entrysee chart

--- 帖子 #41 ---
My chart clearly shows that the EMA13 cross the EMA50 on the open candle at 02/03/2007 16:00 GMT +8. That open price was 1.9557. What is your open candle when the EMA13 cross the EMA50? Does the time settings for different region affect the open candle? Let's try to solve this problem so that it would benefit other traders too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Vynner Have you considered automating this strategy? I would be interested in helping out but am currently snowed under with a millenia of other projects. Even so, this doesnt look bad and i could probably have my programmer check it out. Many of my own systems are based on stochastics and the thing I love about them is they run in 'real time', do not lag and therefore when strategy testing rarely paint the past (dependant on system architecture) Feel free to PM FxNorth

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Vynner I might be looking at this incorrectly but didnt this get chopped around in and out of the market between 31 Jan - 16 Feb? This seems to be the failing of most crossover systems using MA. Just asking. I know you utilize the EMA cross for exit and it appeared that during that period it would have you out very close to entry or in loss. What were your results during that period? FxNorth

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Dear FxNorth, Thanks for your interest in programming this strategy in MT4. Try the Daily Stoch .. It helps to filter some side way market. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #46 ---
hi we have same charts and data feed and if you look even at your own charts the 13 didnt cross 50 until that large candle enlarge candles and you will see i am right

--- 帖子 #47 ---
i see that is true

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Dear all traders, I have zoom in my chart, hope it is clearer to some of you. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #49 ---
thanks V so entry would not have been 9557 but 9480

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Dear harold4x, The EMA13 already cross the EMA50 when it opens. You enter at the open candle not the close .. thanks. When there is another trade, see it for yourself. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #51 ---
My chart shows entry at 1.9562 open of the 4hr bar after the cross

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hopefully my questions/comments will help clear things up a bit about your most recent entry and the possibilities of what could have happened. When entering on a candle open when the 13 crosses the 50, as you did in your most recent trade, there is a possibility that after your entry bar closes that it actually closes in a loss with the chart showing the 13 not crossing the 50 by the time the candle closes . This, then is an unconfirmed cross entry, or basically an entry on a cross as it happens and not confirmed by the bar close. This also means it would be a futile effort to backtest this strategy because of this entry. You cannot see price action within a 4hr bar, so whenever your looking at historical charts and the 13 is hanging right at the 50 it may have crossed and caused you a loss, but you wouldn't "see" it on the chart. I am not stating this as a bad thing, just saving people some wasted time in thinking they will look for answers in backtesting. This must be tested in real time to get accurate results. I hope this makes sense and thank you for sharing your trading method.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Many thanks Sir, I will trade your way.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Dear all traders, This Short trade was closed 4 mins ago. Below is my chart, hope everyone has a rough idea on how to exit. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi and thanks for the method, it was a good short entry and exit; for the next trade the long entry is quite clear according to your rules, however if the market turns back down again as it is right now somehow doing , what are your re-entry rules for another short? Do you wait until a long comes by and after that you consider a short or do you have other rules for a short after the previous short?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hello V, EMA 4 and EMA 13 are going to cross the EMA 50 in UJ Pair. If this happend today, do I still need to wait for %D below %K before I place order for Long or I just do it rigth away. Thank you V.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Dear CORN&amp;B, I have not done any testing on other pairs. I have only done forward testing on GBP/USD. Maybe you can try to do some forward testing on other pairs too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi VyNNeR With the current situation on the GDB The Daily Charts is still in a Short, the 4hr just reached a short again, According to your testing/trading; is this a safe re-entry, or do you just ride the wave once and wait for the daily's to change bullish?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Dear Fx618 I only ride it once, but it might also be a good idea to re-short if you want to. To me this swing trades are good enough to make me few hundred pips a month. I do not like to over trade the same strategy. I do have other tools to help me to trade shorter term but i treat all strategy as different entity. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #60 ---
on this system?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello V, I am very grateful that you share your strategy. This is my first time experience to recognize and understand how the EMA and stochastic explain the market trends. The strategy is simple but so powerful. I mean it is possible to make 100 pips in one single trade. Do you mind to share your strategy for short trading please ? Thank you very much V.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hello WyNNeR, Thanks for sharing your system. I am seeing the USD/CHF pair ready for an entry but leery of the NFP news that's about to come out tomorrow. Any thoughts? Is anyone looking to trade this pair with this strategy and what're your thoughts? Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #63 ---
vynner,how will u trade today for cable? as u can see that the market is v.flat now before the news, thanks...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Dear coolshades, I have done some backtesting on other pairs like USD/JPY , EUR/USD and USD/CHF too. They all give a promising results too. The only pair that i have done forward testing is GBP/USD. The reason why i dont trade other pairs and only GBP/USD is because i found that most majors have high correlation with each other. Some guy gave me an advise before. If you can make a million from one pair why do you need others. It might sound weird but its kinda reasonable as i can concentrate more on one pair's behaviour. If i were to trade 2 lots each on 4 pairs, i would rather trade 8 lots on 1 pair. But anyone who like to forward test on other pairs with this strategy you are most welcome to do so and i guess many would appreciate it too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Dear fratguy, You are welcome. According to this strategy, i have forward test GBP/USD purely based on technicals meaning i would still trade despite any news coming out. But of cos many of us would stay out from a trade just before NFP, its up to you. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Dear fxnewbie, With this particular strategy, the trade was ended already, therefore i will be waiting for the EMA4 and EMA13 to cross EMA50 again to go long provided my daily charts stoch shows up too. Regarding your questions about trading today, i have opened my short position at 1.9306 with 3 lots. +22 on the first lot , broke even on the second lot and my last lot is still floating based on my other tools. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi V, I stayed out of the USD/CHF trade. USD/JPY is going to be ready soon and I do plan on entering the trade. Will keep everyone posted regarding my position. Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Dear Fratguy, Thanks for your effort. Everybody would benefit from you if you keep us updated. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #69 ---
hi ..how about if stochastic 4 hour in overbought .u still entry ..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hello VyNNeR, thanks for the great system. Very nice of you to share it with us. Do you refer to lower time frames at all? Do I understand it correctly that you are using the Stoch. on 4h chart only to determine the TP you are aming for? For example: When the Stoch. on 4hr chart is in the over bought and you are entering long - you exit earlier. Thanks for your reply. Happy pipping to all.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Just bought USD/JPY @ 118.32.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Dear fratguy, Seems like a good trade. I was tempted to buy 118.29 too. Wish you all the best VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #73 ---
shouldnt the trade be executed once the cross is completed and then opening of new candle? if it is executed during the candle when the cross occurs, then the cross might also uncross..?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Coolshades, Yes, you're right. I may have pulled the trigger one candlestick too soon but so far it is working out for me. Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Dear coolshades, Actually EMA4 cross EMA50 gives a good signal already. therefore when EMA13 cross EMA50 its just a double confirmation. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Looks like the cable emas will be crossing upwards soon?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Dear leeroy brown, Both EMAs failed to cross EMA50. We shall wait for a better trade. How is everyone doing? Hope everyone catch some pips today. I have +23 +31 +51 today. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Nice trading ....all since UK session open? I have collected +180 pips off cable and swissy today, but a couple of entries were on the 5th March. I like the look of your 4hr strat and have it in live test mode on fxengines. Your intraday method looks intriguing, you seem to capture 100+ pips with it regularly. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
What happened to the USD/JPY today?, both EMAS crossed upwards, suggesting a long entry at around 118.27 or so, then it dropped straight afterwards?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Dear ChowClown, You did well too. Most of my trades happens during UK and US sessions. It is not really intraday method, but definitely im getting more trades per month with it. What do you mean by "live test mode on fxengines"? VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Dear VyNNeR, Thanks a lot for a nice method. It looks very promising, although we still have to wait for a Gbp/Usd signal to come. Can you please share sometime your other method? Sounds very interesting :-) All the best and good luck with your trading!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi VyNNeR, sent you a pm.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi VyNNeR, can you please reply to my post #70. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
i hear you vynner, so are you saying that it is ok to take a trade once the ema4 and ema50 have crossed, without waiting for ema 13?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Dear coolshades, it usually gives a precaution when EMA4 cross EMA50 and ill wait for the EMA13 to come by b4 i decide to enter the market. the best senario is when EMA4 EMA13 cross EMA50 at the same time or at least at a sharper angle. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Vynner, sent a pm to you. thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi VyNNeR. On which pairs did you pick up your pips today ,or are you exiting and re-entering on one. Cheers

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Dear FOURX, The only pair i trade now is GBP/USD. I have a few accounts and i trade cable on all of my accounts. Some swing and intraday respectively using different strategy and tools VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #89 ---
there shd be a short entry using vynner's strategy at the candle starting 4 pm gmt? both 4 and 13 have crossed 50 downwards and slow d is above slow k on daily... pls correct me if my reading is wrong..

--- 帖子 #90 ---
USD/JPY yes it is a valid entry at 117.31. This is a sharper angle too they cross about the same time.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
well that was a short lived trade. got stopped out at 117.16 when i entered at 117.66. vynner, how did you come at an entry of 117.31? my 4 pm candle has open at 116.66, high of 117.17 and low of 116.47...i use mt4 for charts and broker is fxdd which has a new candle at gmt +2

--- 帖子 #92 ---
vynner, do you re-enter when stopped out, so long as the 2 mas are still below 50 ma and condition on daily chart is also met?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Look at post #59

--- 帖子 #94 ---
i read that dray, but am not sure if the poster meant my scenario, he says something about 'reaching a short again', whereas i am in a short, just got stopped out... if the poster and vyns reply answer my query too, then fine..

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Dear Pluto, Sorry for the later reply, i think i almost missed your post. I only use stoch on daily to determine a valid short or long entry. If you do not like to wait for the EMA4 and EMA13 to recross to determine your exit, you can also use pivots or fibo to determine you exit. But i found that the recross usually give more pips in trending market. Cable has been ranging for the past few weeks, i found it difficult to trade at this market conditions too. We have to be patience to wait for the market to get back in the mode of trends. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Dear coolshades, I myself would advise you to trade this strategy on demo first before doing it on live. You have to get used to how to determine the cross on the 4 hours chart. This question has been asked b4, i noticed the MT4 candles open at a different time from GFT dealbook. If you have an account or demo of dealbook, try to look at 13/03/2007 1600 +GMT 8 .. that is the open candle at 117.31 VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #97 ---
ok.. i am putting the difference in candle open prices as different feeds.. as to demoing first.. i am trading lthis system live.. but on oanda on a lot size of 1 so that is as good as a demo..

--- 帖子 #98 ---
cld you have a look at my post # 92 pls and give your comments? thks

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Dear Coolshades, No i do not do re-entries. I know its a little frustrating not getting enough trades with this strategy. As mentioned b4, this is a swing type of strategy. That is why i uses other tools to get more trades too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi V, Thought the filter for the dailys didn't suggest this as a short entry point. Am I interpreting your system wrong? Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Dear Fratguy, Its pretty hard to determine if the stoch on daily chart is cross or not now for 13/03/2007 From the look at it, it seems a valid one? VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #102 ---
On the daily stoch, it was all the way down and signaling a long and on my chart, it had already crossed over. Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Can you post your chart here please?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
frat,vyn, here goes. i took the trade at the candle marked since the previous candle 13 had crossed 50. the reason for my question of re-entering once stopped out was that, if i had re-entered, i wld have had a very profitable trade...

--- 帖子 #105 ---
The reason why i do not reneter is bcos, if you entered at 117.31 you should not be sotpped out. Anyway i do not trade USD/JPY now. Im just looking at it just to help you out VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I have check your chart coolshades. You should have entered on the previous candle. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Cool According to your chart you should have shorted on the open of the candle before the one shown by the arrow.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
am glad both of you brought this up.. because that is the point i am unclear of.. if i had entered the previous candle, the ema13 was crossing the ema 50 in that candle..my understanding is that you enter the trade after the cross has occured and set in stone.. which means enter the trade in the subsequent candle. which is what i did if you take the trade on the candle on which the cross is occuring, then there is a possibility the price can reverse in that candle and hence no cross at all. pls let me know ur comments.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
It is very hard to comment in retrospect, but by the look of your chart it seems as if when the small candle closed and the big candle opened, the cross had already been in place, therefore it cannot uncross, of course it can cross back up again but not uncross. Only watching in realtime shows whether on open of the big candle (the one before the arrow) the cross had already taken place and confirmed or not.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
vynner has suggested a tp when the two mas cross..an alternate cld be when the stochastics cross on the 4 hr chart... i havent back tested this. just observation. this tp is conservative, so you probably end up leaving some pips on the table.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Dear all traders, We have another swing trade on GBP/USD based on this strategy. Look at the chart below Open Long @ 1.9.383. This is not really an excellent open signal as you can see that the EMAs is not a a great angle, but who knows .. let's us all see how this trade develop. This is just for demonstration purposes only, anyone who wants to trade this please do it at your own risk. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks for posting a current chart with a attached opinion. I have looked back in history briefly and have not found where the four hour stocs have shown to be crossing over signaling a short position at the height of the four hour emas showing a long position could be taken. I realize your haven't put any credibility on the four hour stocs, but based upon your past experience, does this put any pressure upon the standard trade of going long at this time? Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Dear Robert, You might want to look at overbought and oversold situations, but im more interested in the daily stochs to have a bigger picture on where the market is heading. We all know that the market can be in overbought/oversold senario for days or even weeks. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi V, Sorry I couldn't post the chart earlier for the USD/JPY. Anyways, looks like you are right so far... it is starting to break out now. Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Dear Vynner, First of all thanks for sharing this swing trade method. For the last proposed trade of yours, for what i see on the daily chart on GBP.USD it seems that %D IS above %K so this trade would not pass the filter on daily. Also , on the 4H chart I see that 13ema is going to cross 50ema, but it hasn't cross it yet, and the candle is still on the move, not finished yet. I'm a bit confused about the GO order for this particular setup.

Dear 3cent Attached is the Daily chart .. Stoch %K is above %D. I dont see any problem with the filter. The only concern i have is the angle how the EMA is crossing the EMA50 VyNNeR

Hi V, Now that we're up 100 pips, is it a good idea to add on another position because we're already in the money? And regarding exiting the position, I know we milk it until the 4EMA crosses 13 on the 4 hr chart. Would you still agree with that? Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Can you explain more about what angles for the EMA crossing would be a stronger signal? Is a steeper angle much better than a less steep angle? Perhaps we could use a compass to measure the angle

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Dear Fratguy, I will stick to my rules but if you want you can take your profits at any kind of support or resistance since the EMA4 and EMA13 didnt cross the EMA50 at a great angle. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Dear zamakhtar, If EMA4 and EMA13 cross EMA50 at about the same time usually that produce a much better angle and usually produce a much stronger signal. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #124 ---
vynner, I know this is going to sound foolish, but somebody's gotta ask! Once your up on pips, are you simply moving your stop to break even then waiting for a signal to get out of the move or are you moving up your stop the whole time? It was a GREAT move today! Thanks again for sharing your techniques. Robert DeCuir

Great system vynner, I've been tracking it and it's been showing very great potential. In fact, I'm using it as of now. So now, I've actually added it into my trading use. I've got 2 styles that I use, the first being my own discretionary decisions and the second being your system. Well done!

Dear jeffreytp, I have viewed all your sample charts. I have noticed you always got in one candle late. If all your entries are one candle earlier than it will be correct. Hope this clear your doubts. VyNNeR

Dear lcfxtrader, Can you please clearly show where is your entry? I cannot determine your entry from your chart. Thanks VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Looks like instead of using the EMA 13, I was using the EMA 25. Don't know how that happened, but I'll have to run through it again to make sure I am doing this correctly. Thanks for the feedback!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I looked back from mid-Nov. 2006 thru now using the strategy chart setup specified in Post # 1. This exit strategy I describe below will cut most losses you would have otherwise incurred using the original exit strategy. In most case where you previously would have lost, now you can actually gain. The occasional drawback I noticed was some of our gains are cut short also, but I will show how to fail-safe this so you can still reap the long terms trends by applying Step # 2 to this exit strategy. So here it is: Step # 1: Once you enter the trade, observe the 4H chart, if the %k and %d cross before the EMA 4 &amp; EMA 13, close your position at the next candle open. Simple as that. Some discretion may be used as well to obtain best pricing, but stick to the program. Step 2: If after you exit this trade based on the %k and %d cross, if the %k and %d cross again in the opposite direction, following the existing trend, enter the trade immediately at the %k and %d cross again in the direction of your original entry. ONLY enter a second time (or more times) ONLY IF the EMA 13 and EMA4 have not yet crossed. Finally, exit the trade according to Step # 1 above. I have not forward tested this technique, but will begin at the next trade entry. New task, the strategy and Money Management. Sure this strategy works not taking into account drawn down and margin requirements, but should we have in place for protection and risk management. This SWING trade system seems pomising now... Jeff

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi V, Are you still holding on to this position? Looks like the upside engery is fizzling out and all throughout the day it has been trading close to the support trendline on the hourly chart. Any thoughts? Thanks, Fratguy

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Dear Jeff, I have gone through all your charts on post #141. I noticed you got some entries/exits correct but some are still one candle late (which makes quite a big difference). Remember you do not neccessary wait for the EMA13 to fully cross the EMA50 to have a valid entry. Sames go to the EMA4 and EMA13 on the exits. Hope this would help you to understand better. Anyway your re-entry looks interesting but i'm doing very fine with my set of rules. Hope you can do a forward test on the exit rules of yours. VyNNeR

Dear Fratguy, Yes I'm still holding my Long position from 1.9384. Yes i agree with you that the upside is exhausting, but you never know what cable can do It might be also trying to gain more momentum to move up again. We shall see how this trade develop. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I need to double check one thing. Regarding the EMA's, what price do you apply them to: OPEN, HIGH, LOW, CLOSE? Thanks, Jeff

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Dear jeffreytp, price is close. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Ahh, that could be why we had conflicting candles. I previously had the EMA 4 = open, EMA 13 = close, EMA 50 = open. I don't know how I figured that... I thought "open" because we were making our entries based on the open of the next candle prices...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Has anyone back tested this strategy to see how the results would look using EMA open versus EMA close prices?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I like this system, similar to bagovino but on a 4 hour chart

--- 帖子 #156 ---
read it 3 times already and cant wait to try it HOHO

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Here's a quick and dirty indicator. It only checks for 4 EMA (4 hr. close) above/below 50 EMA (4 hr. close) and Stoch daily 13,5,5 above/below signal line. If both are above or both are below it gives an alert. Doesn't matter what chart TF it's attached to, it goes as above. You can turn on the sound &amp;/or email alert. I haven't really tested it except it works on the condition right now, so use at your own risk. It's only to help alert you to a possible setup so you don't have to stay glued to the tube. Hope it helps ya. Oops, forgot to attach. Edit doesn't let you.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
detach to indicators folder. Once it indicates, you should detach it, or it will keep alerting and fill your log file. It will play sound only once per bar.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Dear blueruby, thanks blueruby for taking an effort to write this down on mt4. I believe many ppl would appreciate your effort. Thanks again. Wow look at our open swing trade now on cable. Its up almost +290 pips now Hope some of you caught some pips too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Vynner mentioned that he picks up 100-150 pips for every swing trade,HOWEVER he doesn't get out until the EMA's cross. Did I listen??.....NOOOOOOOOOO, I got out with a 100 pip profit thinking I'm king of the hill! I can't believe what I've left on the table, Damn! Somebody pass me a bowl of Gumbo and a Pat O'Briens Hurricane so I can drown my foolishness. Thanks again for the great recommendation, RCD

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Oh god the misery! Only 100 pips profit! Surely you could never make a living off of that!? /sarcasm Couldn't resist. Am I the only one who'd be happy just walking away with 100 pips a week?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Dear Robert, Don't be disappointed. 100 pips is good All we have to do is just wait for another swing setup. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Morning VyNNer, What did you mean by this last post of yours. How do i get the other systems that you use. many thanks and great work. Bill

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Jeffrey &amp; Vynner, I think I have discovered a better way to exit the trade which will save/make additional pips. My method uses MACD, a three colored version with settings 12,26,1. The indicator is attached. The entry is as outlined at the beginning. The exit is as follows: When the MACD changes to the opposite color the position is exited at the close of the 2nd opposite colored MACD Histogram bar. You can also re-enter based on the MACD color changes. I have attached a chart showing the entries and exits. The chart is described as follows: Pair is GBP/JPY Trade taken on Feb 26th @ 233.23 and according to the entry rules. An early exit (for this particular run) occurred when the MACD histogram bars changed to blue (indicating a retracement). According to my rules, the position exits @ 232.76 for a 47 pip gain. However, after the 2nd bar, the color changes back to red and the fall resumes. I re-enter (trader's option) on the next closed bar @ 231.69 and don't exit until the 2nd blue bar occurs @ 223.37 for an additional 832 pips, giving a total of 879 pips in 6-7 days. This is an extreme case but today on the GBP/JPY I am up 500+ pips in my demo account. I would be extremely interested in someone coding this for an EA. Seeing that I work everyday, I sometimes miss entries and the best exits. Is anyone out there up to the challenge?! 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I will test this on GBP/UDS from mid Nov 2006 thru now, as I have done manually for this thread. I will post the results and conclusion.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
What stop loss do you use with this pair?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Jeffrey, That would be a good study. Most of the research (informal) I've done shows that when there is a loss, it is usually small. In answer to one of the recent posts about stop losses. I recently tried a SL of 60 on the AUD/USD and got stopped out early. The pair continued to climb (as of today) from my stop another 260 pips. I am now more inclined to use a stop of 75-100 depending on how the daily range looks. I also move my stop loss as the pair rises or falls to within this range. 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Vynner, I am not sure that I understand the purpose of the Stoch. on 4h chart. How is it influencing your trading? Thanks for all your help.

If this works for other pairs as well we could be in for an up swing on USDCHF soon enough. Am I reading it correctly ?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Vynner, Congrats on the 740 pips, is that using this system or is that using all your systems put together. and if it is other systems do you have one that is great for scalping whilst waiting for the swing set ups. and can you share that with us please. great work. Many thnaks Bill

Hi Vynner, What do you think adding SHI channel into it.Correct me if im wrong, I found out , let say if signal indicates to go SHORT but if the candle is at the bottom of the channel u better becareful?..What do you think?

4 EMA already crossed 50 EMA @USDJPY !! R U ready for next short ??

I think we should wait for 13 EMA to cross 50 EMA before we take short position and please pay attention to the news release at 7:30 PM as it forecast Positive for both Durable and Core Durable goods.

hi there vynner , this system looks damn good . i saw something similar to it a while back , but it was on a 2hr chart .but it wasnt that good because there were too many false starts and it didnt have that "day filter" either .i trade options so i am going to try to incorporate this strategy with them also. i just wondered also , that you say you have a scalping or day trading strategy . i have a reasonably good one but am always looking to better myself . care to share ? many thanks

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Muharief, Vynner has made it clear at the first of this thread that he has only forward tested this strategy on GBP/USD. Keep a close eye on your trade should you take it on USD/JPY and let us know how you did. It will be interesting to hear about your results. Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Okay, I just use this strategy @ my demo account thank you for your warning. And now I've already get 40 pips @ my demo account .

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Dear Muharief, Good job on you pips. Let us know what is the results on USD/JPY in the future. Although i did not backtest this strategy on other pairs, fom the look from the past it sure gives promising results too. Please try to forward test before putting your hard earn $$ on to it. VyNNeR

Hey VyNNeR, Thanks for sharing this system. I am a swing trader, most of the time, I got caught in the sideways market, even though in the end the trade itself resulting some profits. But the time I had to wait until the market gets out of its sideways period, it makes me sick. . Your system filters those sideways market. Good job! Cheers, Bangun

Dear all, The above chart is what i meant by sharp angle on my previous post. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #192 ---
This chart did not meet the rules: 1) the 4H EMA 13 cossed EMA 50 before EMA 4 which breaks the rules 2) It does look like the Daily Stoch (5,5,13) was less than the signal which meet the rules. Shouldn'y we wait for confirmation from both indicators?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Oops - you are right about the daily stoch, Jeff. But I'm not sure I understand your problem with the crossings. My entrypoint was 16.00 CET where 4ema &gt; 13ema &gt; 50ema. Anyway - I'm glad I'm in

finally they crossed but is daily charts showing it's not a sign of entry ??

--- 帖子 #205 ---
so i think this is the time we put a sell on GBP/USD right?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
...you need to wait for the 13ema to cross the 50ema, before entering a short. It might take a couple/few more 4hr periods for this to happen.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
ok. thanx for telling me. i think i get to carried away.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hey Vynner, Have you placed a trade &amp; stop (by your recommended set up) and have it come back to bite you or at least leave you with a minor loss In GBP/USD? And if so can you guesstimate how often it has happened to you? Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I played with adding the EMA 20 Close, and I would enter a trade at the close of the candle upon the first of these crosses: EMA 4 Close crosses EMA 13 Close , then EMA 13 crosses the EMA 20 close OR EMA 4 Close crosses EMA 13 Close , then EMA 13 crosses the EMA 50 close. By adding the EMA 20 you are able to get in earlier sometimes. For instance here is a trade: GBP/USD Short on 3/29/07 16:00 GMT at 1.9621 At this time the Daily Stoch was less then the signal. ALL of these factors indicate a Short position. I will exit this trade when either of these occurs first: 1) Stop loss of 50 pips or 2) 4H Stoch (13,5,5) is greater than the signal at the close of the candle or 3) on 4H chart, the EMA 4 is equal to or crosses the EMA 13 at the candle close so far so good.

I have a PPC-6700 with Sprint and have the plan so I can get internet anytime. I recently installed MT4 on it. It is pretty sweet! You can have all the indicators and trade. What do you suggest during those sleeping hours? I can't see myself waking up every 4 hours. This strategy is so mechanical I beleive an EA would work. Would an EA work though because we are basing our entry off of two different chart timeframes?

ok.....BGP just went sky high

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Looks like according to my rules. I would have been stopped out at 1.3370 -50 PIPS A long position may be forming. Right now the EMA's confirm, but the daily stoch is pending. Will see what the candle close looks like. Stoch must be &gt; signal to generate a long trade. If this turns into a trade, I am saying now that I do not like it because it is unclear whether the EMA 4 crossed the EMA 20 before the EMA 13 crossed the EMA 20.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I see this. Not a good thing. I haven't backtested this (I would need tick data to do so), but I have a hunch this would work in our favor: Once the trade is entered set a SL -50 (since this is the strategy SL rule) to close all lots, also place a TP + 50 for half the lots. If the SL triggeres first, the trade is over. If the TP triggers first, move the SL to 0 (what you intially entered the trade at). Right now if the TP triggered, you would be up with a locked in 50 pips and no risk on the down side. Using this MM strategy would have saved us on this GBP trade.

dear vynner , you say you went long on cable . but the 4 ema didnt cross the 50 ema because it never went under it .is that what you would still call a valid trade ? i see that it has gone sky high anyway . im just trying to get the peramiters of this system precisely correct .and you say that you nearly had a trade last friday . which one was that , was it cable short ?

GBP/USD I went long 3/30/07 12:00GMT at the close 1.9681 with a SL=50 for half units. 4/2/07 half units were sold for + 50 profit. SL was moved to BE. Now waiting for exit signal.

wasnt that a valid short at 4 pm gmt today, entry at 1.2135?

My knowledge would say NO because at 4:00 GMT close, the ma 4 &amp; 13 are both greater than the ma 50 in addition, on the daily chart the Stoch is &gt; signal.

Anyone go long on the GBP/JPY at 3/30/07 8:00 GMT at 231.29? Currently at 232.95, what a nice ride and still rising... NOte: the Daily chart rules did not comply for a buy.

happy, on March 30th, the 4 and 13 EMA's crossed but the 13ema didn't cross the 50ema. Matter of fact, the mkt skyrocketed and went in the opposite direction. But, rest assured, either this week, or next week, we'll get our trade in. I would imagine that there's 2 trades per month that gives off at least 100 pips. February gave off 3 trades. The first trade was a small loss of a max of 30 pips if you would have stayed in that long. The second and third trades of February were at least 100 pips profit if you were going for 100 pips only, like I only do. For March, there were only two trades and both were good for 100 pips or more each... So, I can already see that a person can double there account every single month just off of two trades per month... hilton

--- 帖子 #232 ---
but on my chart they did crossed 50ema that's why i so confused about it.....dont know how to post pic here.......

--- 帖子 #233 ---
here is the pic

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Perhaps you need to double check your EMA settings because my charts don't have the 50 being crossed either.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Vynner, One reason why I like the 4hr swing trade is because it only gives out 2 or 3 trades per month and allows me to double my account monthly from what I can see. Now, you started in June 2006 and it's been almost a year now. I have witnessed, myself, between the months of February and March of 2007 that a person would have been able to have gotten(with 100 pips on each trade as a goal to hit) at least 150 pips for both February and 150 pips minimum for March. Now, from October of 2006 through January of 2007, I would have imagined that with your swing trading system, a person would have been able to get at least(once again with a goal of hitting 100 pips per trade) 150 pips on each of those months(October 2006-January of 2007). The other thing I like about trading the swing trade is that it has happened(the signal to both get in and out of a trade) 100% of the time during the european session, which is quite an eye opener. It is 100% possible to spend less than 20 minutes, per month, to see if a signal has happened or not. Question: Has there been any month whereby you've gotten less than 150 pips in a month using this swing trading method? thanks, hilton

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Folks, Well, according to Vynner...it looks like a good trade is about to come up. And, it's about time..hehe.. The trade should occur at some point next week in which it will be my first trade. I'm going for only 100 pips. If this trade occurs next week, there should be a second trade this month and just MAYBE a 3rd trade. But, I could on doing two profitable trades per month no matter what... peace, hilton

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Did you account for drawdown? You're going to have some losing trades. Even if you have a SL there will be some losses, but longterm, you'll be ahead. My next task is to look at GBP/JPY. I already know the PIP gains are CRAZY http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif , but I have to examine the drawndown risk...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
AFAIK This system can easily be automated. One could do that to see the results in backtesting and easily test the system on other pairs, too.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Will you be creating an EA for this system?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yes, looks like another trade is fast approaching. I'm guessing tomorrow's data will be what determines if this sets up or not. I did some bactesting (just eyeballing trades based on the crosses) and came up with approx 1558 pips to date, about 300 per month, starting with Nov. I had 16 trades, 5 losing trades at -50 pips each. Looks promising!

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Jeffreytp, Just curious if you ever researched my method for the exit?...using MACD. See post 164. Looks like we will be taking some trades next week... 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Jeff... Yeah dude, there will be drawdowns. For example, the first trade of February 7th, there was a signal, but then if you would have gotten out when the 4 ema crossed the 13ema, a person would have had a 13 pip loss which is no big deal. But, then, a day later, there was another signal and that trade would have yieled at least 100 pips(I go for 100 pips each time I trade regardless if the trade does more than that). Then on Feb. 22 there was another signal that would have yielded another 100 pips. So, that month would have been a 182 pip month for me had I been trading that month. hilton

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Sounds interesting, i'm writing an EA now to see what is worth. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi, Thank you for sharing system. I'm trying to do some backtesting and just need a quick clarrification on the entry. Is the process is in order, First, the entry signal on the 4hr chart then check day chart for the filter. Or is it wait for stoch cross on the day chart then look for entry on 4 hr chart. Ta Yellow

--- 帖子 #245 ---
First look for a cross on 4hour chart for entry signal, then look at daily chart if the daily stoch is in same direction as the 4hour ema cross hope this helps

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Well, I've written it, and it seems to work great. It made 3488$ profit in two months backtesting, and doubled the money(initial 10000$) in one year (For some reason MT doesn't let me backtest on dates before 2006). Thanks, buddy!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
can you share the ea for us please ?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
the 4 just crossed on the GBP. I assume we wait for the 13 to cross the 50 and take the trade on the next 4hr candle open?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hello. Another new possibility to step in position in GBPUSD slowly forming? Gabe

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yes short coming up on GBP/USD. Daily stoch is alrady down, so after ema cross on 4hour, enter on open of next candle

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I may have missed it earlier in the thread but how do you treat the weekend? If there is a valid signal on Friday is there a problem with taking it?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi Guys.... I've notice the possibility too... the 4 is already cross and it seems that we have short coming up on cable but i suppose it will happen on monday rite ?? cuz i think the probability the 13 will cross the 50 will occur on monday If i think it's too early too trade this pair, is it wrong ?? or the down of daily stoch is already a valid confirmation to take the trade ?? well pavejon, we have the same worry though...

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I wouldn't take it going into the weekend. I wouldn't take it until that second ema crosses. Then you will never second guess yourself or the system. Stick with the rules and you will never get mad at yourself for making the wrong move!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
My chart shows the 13ema is just 12 pips away from crossing the 50. Based on the daily, I'm opening a small short now and will add more once the cross is confirmed.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
exactly right hoss, everybody .....stick to the rules and get used to it . if you get in too early you will have many many false starts . try to do a back test of all the trades that were "nearly" ready and you will have many many losers which affect you psychologically and financially , i can assure you . stick to the road , dont get lost in the jungle

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Well said. Remember that you open at the next 4hr candle AFTER the cross. Be patient. This may be a 4hr trend line test.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I did test the exit using MACD from 11/21/06 - 3/16/07 and the pip gain was FAR less than using the EMA or 4H Stoch as an exit.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Howdy VyNNeR and all. Good to see this thread still hopping. I've not been following, but will take the cable trade on Monday. I've revamped the indicator, but now I see someone's programmed an EA. Good going. This indicator does as follows: When the daily stoch is below the signal AND The 4 is below the 50 It gives a "short pre-setup" alert ONCE. When the 13 then crosses below the 50 it will give the "short trade setup" alert every minute. All the opposite for long presetup and long trade. You can turn on Email alerts and sound also. Default for both is false. Either way an alert box pops up on your screen.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I'm using Metatrader 4 for the first time today - how do I import that file?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Peter, I don't even look at the daily 13,5,5 stochastics dude. The first trade of February was only a 13 pip loss and the slow daily stochastics on that one was questionable. Yet, there wasn't even a big loss on that; just 13 lousy pips, but the next two trades in February(2007) were 100 pip winners dude. hilton

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Save the file to the metatrader4/experts/indicators folder then restart Metatrader. Click the icon on the top tool bar that has a folder and a star. Drag and drop the indicator onto your chart.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi VyNNeR and all. thank u for sharing your system. I try to exit with more pips as in the basic rule and am find that if a i add a DEMA indicator adjust 24 ( u will see it in the 2 charts bellow ,the black line), when it cross the 4ema it gave about 50 more pips/trade...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
interesting...DEMA...never heard of that. It's some kind of EMA, I guess...Could you elaborate on this indicator?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is a combination of a single exponential moving average and a double exponential moving average. The advantage is that gives a reduced amount of lag time than either of the two separate moving averages alone. The Double Exponential Moving Average can be applied in the same manner as the Simple Moving Average or Exponential Moving Average. When price crosses the moving average and increases, a continuing uptrend can be expected. The DEMA is calculated via: (2 * n-day EMA) - (n-day EMA of EMA) where EMA = exponential moving average Thus, Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is a unique composite of a single exponential moving average and a double exponential moving average that provides less lag than either of the two components individually. DEMA can be used in place of trading traditional moving averages

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I see that the13 crossed the 50. But the sto. on 4h chart is well in the oversold and heading up. Should we wait for the 4h sto. to go up and then turn down to enter our sell trade? As it is now, I feel uncorfotable to enter the trade. Good pipping to all.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
And the 4EMA has to cross the 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
The 4 also crossed the 50.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
The STO on my 4HR chart is still showing a downward move.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Wonderful! Many thanks, Blueruby! Happy trading this week, FXS

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Is it time to open a short?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
13 still needs to cross the 50.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
it has crossed on my chart, the blue line crossing the green line do I wait till the opening of the next candle?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
could you share the mq4 or your template? Thanks! FXS

--- 帖子 #275 ---
The rules say at the open of the next candle after the cross. On my platform the 13 EMA is still 7 pips away from the 50 EMA.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yeah, 13 has not crossed yet. The earliest you could enter would be 12 AM EST as you cannot enter until it crosses, and then you have a new open candle.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Are your EMAs applied to the close price? Mine are. On my chart (see my last post), the 13 EMA has crossed the 50 EMA. If the current bar closes (9 PM EST) with the 13 EMA below the 50 EMA, according to my chart I would open a short...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
yeah, they are applied to the close and still the 13 has not crossed on my charts. they way i understand it, you must wait until the cross then open at the new 4 hour candle. so, technically you wouldn't open a trade at 00:00 GMT because the last ema cross did not happen before that and the ema could uncross itself in the meantime.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
My eSignal charts show the 13 crossing the 50 as well. I opened a small position and will probably add to it once this current 4H candle closes.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Can you post a pic of your chart? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Here is my chart.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Odd your chart seems very different from mine. My chart has two more bars than yours after that big down movement on April 6th, and is already showing April 9th.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
What a setup! Short @1.9650... Anyone else in on this bad boy?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
can anyone tell me how to set up the settings EMA4,13,50 on the chart. I'm very new and don't have a clue...thx.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Are you on Metatrader? If you are then go to Insert -&gt; Indicators -&gt; Trend -&gt; Moving Average Under MA method select Exponential and then under Period put in the number. Do this for each EMA, and there is the option to change the color as well.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
So whose shorting the pound right now?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I'm short. Not crazy about going against the trend, now that I look at it. But, on 3/2 it set up like this and was good for 300 pips in 3 days, so, I'll ride it out.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
stochs are all over sold and trend is up. Looks to go north in th near term to me

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hey Everyone, I have VT Trader and it shows not only a crossing at the end of the previous candle, but I am in as of the start of the current candle we are all starring at. Funny how so many different systems don't really coincide at a mutual point. I wish you all the best on the first trade of April. The last trade recommendation by Vynner netted me 100 pips . Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Stochs are heading that way, but not there yet. Until they bottom and turn up, they're not saying "long" to me. (Been studying SpudFyre all weekend). What TF are you looking at to see an uptrend?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Robert, What's VT Trader?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Same as you, apparently. Been following Spud thread since the begining and studying his system all weekend, too. 15, 30, hr and 4 hour are, or were below 20 when I posted. 15 started to turn but leveled out again. I'm not ready to trade long either, but wouldn't be short right now unless I was riding an old position looking to squeeze a few more pips out. But, being Sunday all bets are off...this could go aywhere

--- 帖子 #293 ---
OK, so then remember, these stochs could flatten down under 20 and stay there while price goes south a long way farther. Spud says they have to all be turned and heading your way to take a trade. That's all I'll say about the other system here, it's a short term system, VyNNeR is a swing system.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Question? I'm fairly new at this and have a question regarding market hours. With the holiday who is and isn't open? I know Tokyo is open npw and NY will be open tomorrow, but is London closed tonight and if so are there smaller markets that keep the trading open?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Good question. I had to think about it a second. It's already tomorrow in London, so they'll open Monday morning as usual, about 3 EST.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Interesting...I have a little widget on my desktop that says London doesn't open until 1am (MDT) on the 10th

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Blueruby, looking at those stochs now? whattaya think?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Blueruby, I go thru Capital Market Services for a broker and the platform offered is called "Visual Trading". I don't know how common it is compared to Metatrader. Currently I am up eleven ticks. Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I am in

--- 帖子 #300 ---
4 hr still going down. This is a swing trade, we're not concerned if it goes against us 30 pips in the next hour or two. Note that Spud's method is usually short term - hours or less, and he sometimes takes 4 - 7 pips profit. Different game. Although you could try to use it to get a better entry for the GU short , that does complicate things, mixing two systems.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
With the markets closed tomorrow for Easter (NY/London) do you think the short set up (13 crossing the 50) is a valid signal on the pound?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Oooo, that is what the FF calendar says. Oughta read these things (doh!). If I'd known they were closed I wouldn't have taken the trade.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Dear all traders, We have a short signal 2 hours ago. Sell @ 1.9644 Stop @ 1.9694 (Please add your spread if necessary) I see some of you are worried about the oversold stochs on the 4 hours chart. For me i'm just sticking to my rules, trading is still trading. Sometimes we win sometimes we lose. The idea is to get consistent positive pips in the long run. Let's hope this is another good trade. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I still don't have a cross of the 13 and the 50. Dear all traders, VyNNeR, How do you handle the market being closed tomorrow after a weekend? Is it ok to enter now knowing there will probably be little movement until London opens on the 10th?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I see some of you are worried about the oversold stochs on the 4 hours chart. For me i'm just sticking to my rules, trading is still trading. Sometimes we win sometimes we lose. The idea is to get consistent positive pips in the long run. Actually, we were looking at two different trading strategies and as things are setting up they may both be working out. Yours signaled earlier, but the one I was looking at is still developing. Interesting that both might pay off yet.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hello All! I'm just getting my trade signal now (approx. 02:45 GMT) generated by the VyNNer Swing Trade Indicator. It looks to be working excellent. THANKS AGAIN, BLUERUBY! Is it lagging? The Pip Surf's Up! FXS

--- 帖子 #307 ---
some of Mt4 platform opening 1 or 2 hours late such as my demo account which only crossed 1H ago but the other one crossed about 4-6hs early

--- 帖子 #308 ---
we still dont have cross of 13/50 right ? on my interbank chart 13/50 are just touching eachother

--- 帖子 #309 ---
i think we had it

--- 帖子 #310 ---
then only Interbank doesnt have cross i think yet.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
In my point of view.... we have short on cable The 13 has already cross the 50 I'm taking this trade also hope this one is a good signal cuz the daily stoch is still confirming Let see then

--- 帖子 #312 ---
ok finally, SHORT opened on GBP/USD @ 1.9638 at 8:00GMT

--- 帖子 #313 ---
how many pip your TP? if SL 50 pip, thanks maja

--- 帖子 #314 ---
no fixed tp, will trail it

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Keep to the rule and you will never regret

--- 帖子 #316 ---
No fixed Tp here either. Will wait to either be stopped out OR will be out once the 4 and 13 cross up. I like the way this trade set up since we will again be in a good set up once it flips and starts going north. Some potential ponits of interest however, would be 9570 (.382) and 9497 (.50). Fibs drawn from 3/4 low to 4/3 high.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
yeah....that might be a good idea and I really doubt that fixed TPs are a good idea BTW, it's just a lot easier.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Well as for me.... I enter with 3 lot 1st lot TP 50 2nd lot TP 100 and the third i let it run until it run out of steam and I'll trail the SL also I dunno wether this is a good strategy or not love feedback anyway

--- 帖子 #319 ---
You're welcome. I'm happy to contribute what I can, for now. Someday maybe I'll be the guru helping all these frustrated newbies to become profitable, I hope. Anyway, previous versions of the indicator will FILL a person's email. I don't use email alerts so I wasn't really considering the possibilities fully. This one will send one email per bar. So, on a 4-hr chart, 1 per 4 hours. It will also only play the sound once per bar. So, take note. If the Pre-setup and Entry signals occur on the same bar, you'll only get one email. Attaching to a different TF chart will not affect the calculations and signals, only the frequency of emails/sound. It will give a popup alert every 5 minutes. It has three alerts now. The Pre-alert is for the 4 / 50 crossing w/daily stoch crossed in agreement. The Entry alert is if pre-alert is true AND the 13 crossed the 50. Once entry alert is true, then it looks for the 4 / 13 cross in the other direction as an Exit signal. Each of the three has its own switch in user inputs. If you're having no problem sitting at the tube keeping an eye on it, and the alert boxes are driving you nuts, turn off that alert. If you find a bug, let me know. Where's that EA that somone programmed?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
+43 pips on this one since I caught the cross last night @ 1.9650 and Shorted!!! Too bad its on demo... Any similar results???

Up 30. It's always fun when it goes your way right off the bat. I'm thinking of pulling the stop down around 9670 or so. Anyone else move their stop yet?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Very simple system, might be helpful! I'm stunned with recent sell - who would thought that during holiday you can get those pips How many valid signals do you get per month and what avg pips do you make of it? I suppose on Cable that's more than 100? PS bounce from fibo @ 9578?

That sounds dangerous. When I'm profitable for 4 - 6 weeks in a row, then we'll see about it.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
What is happening right now? all pips made is going. should i still stick to the rule?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Wait. This is a non-discretionary system. The minute you try and out-think the market, is the minute you will lose. You must accept losses if they come. With patience, the wins will come and outnumber the losses.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I agree with Hoss However, my concern is where to put the stop. I try to put it somewhere that, were the price to hit it, would be a high probability that the trend is reversing. Right now its at 9674. Now an important question: If the 4 EMA crosses the 13 EMA, do we wait for the start of a new candle and then close the position, or do we close the position as soon as we see the cross? It could uncross itself in that case as well.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I can't emphasize enough how important that is in my opinion. BTW, are you Ohio State fan? Aren't the Buckeyes from there? I went there for 6 months...to I should know

--- 帖子 #334 ---
If you would look back into the thread, someone ( I don't remember who) suggested that you might consider exiting when the 4 hour stocs cross and wait to see if they cross back over (and re-enter the trade in the original direction) AND verify that the daily stocs are still going into the direction of the trade. I would highly suggest going back to look for a clarification on the above . THIS IS NOT WHAT VYNNER RECOMMENDS. Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Yep! From Columbus!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Position hit stop for loss of 40 pips. We might see a long signal soon, so I'll be ready for that.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Daily Stoch still shows down? What are the re-entering rules for this strategy?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Oh yea good point, then I guess that would not be a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
On this current signal I was at one point 50 pips in profit (stop loss was 50 pips), should I have set my stop loss to break even? I only lowered it by about 10 pips instead, so I have ended up with a 40 pip loss. My concern is because this signal, in backtesting, would probably be considered a winner or at least break even but perhaps I have mismanaged the trade? Otherwise, I will just accept this as a normal cost of trading an overall profitable system.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
This system is not based on moving stops. Although moving it to break even in this case may have saved you money, in other cases it would have taken you out early and you may miss a 200-300 pip run. It's amazing sometimes how one 4hr candle comes along and wipes these trades out.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Here's the post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=143 I Have to do more back testing of this strategy to reconfirm the rules. Hoepfully this will be accomplished this week and I can post the results.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Vyn, just found out this strategy and looking forward to monitoring this system to get a feel of it. Look like even stop loss at 9700 round number had been swept away in early asian season. Are you still holding short position?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
So what's our next step with this strategy? I am assuming everyone's SL was hit for this last trade setup. is there any re-entering rules or do we simply wait for the next signals to set up?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I think we should wait for the next valid signal am i rite ?? I don't think we're going to have long on cable rite away..... even if the 4 and 13 cross the 50 to the north cuz the 4h stoch and the daily stoch are not line up (well i kinda borrow this method from TEB63, to see wether the 4h and daily are going in the same direction) or is it possible to set the trade when the daily stoch is not confirming ?? anyway... i took first lot TP + 40 pips and 2 lot BE better to wait and see

--- 帖子 #345 ---
well, i found this thread over the weekend, backtested it (papertrades), and familiarised myself with it. i would say, wait for next signals. game of patience. fewer trades, but great results. i papertraded this strategy from sept through to yesterday .. i had over 2000 pips as my result from 24 trades. 17 wins, 7 losses...

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Can someone or you explain how to papertrade? I use metatrader

--- 帖子 #347 ---
papertrading is: you take historical data - your charts - and test how the strategy would have worked. You can also try on a demo account, that's what gives your even more realistic results.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
my meaning is that i put the charts up.. scroll back as far is it will take me, then get pen and paper out.. then you log each trade as you go through the charts. as tradeigel says, demo trading is even better as you have to make your decision right then and there. with paper trading people might see the good trend coming and think "hmmm, the signal isn't quite there, but i'll go long anyway".. this obviously falsifies results. i have not done this with mine, i try and be honest with myself and keep it mechanical. speaking of which, i tried it out on EUR/JPY, not as good results over the same period.. the daily stoch was keeping it out of big moves. because each pair is different, i changed the stoch to 20,5,5 and it had near identical trades to the original, but an additional 4 trades which gave an extra 400 pips or so. this is another trap too... don't try and fit indicators to what you want. i only changed the stoch as to smooth it out to see the results. again, demo it and see how it REALLY goes.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
looks like a bullish signal has arrive back....hope this time the setup is correct..get prepared everybuddy

--- 帖子 #350 ---
there is no bullish signal yet . remember the daily stoch , well it is still pointing down . so at the mo , we are in no mans land .

--- 帖子 #351 ---
yeah saw that the stoch has no uptrend yet... just waiting for that filter...hope it does goes up

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Yes, you have to be patient with this one. From averages that have been posted here, you are only getting about 4 trades per month. But at 3% per trade, that can amount to about 18% per month on your balance. I don't need to remind you what kind of compounding that can do to your account.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hey Hoss... I like the way you stick to the rules It reminds me that discipline is in fact the most powerful tool in trading also $ mgt

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Agreed. This system will also keep you from over-trading which can be an account killer.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
hii hoss this is my firest time in this forms...... so could u review this stratege ... in points 1... 2... &amp; need how many trades in a month.... thanks for ur help

--- 帖子 #356 ---
It's all laid out in post #1. I can't lay it out any simpler than that. You're looking at about 3-4 trades per month on average according to some of the statistics people have posted on this thread.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
thank u for ur help....

--- 帖子 #358 ---
it look a good deal .......

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Dear hoss, I appreciate the way you remind all fellow traders to stick to the rules. No doubt without the filter, we might get some interesting trades and pips but with my experience, i would rather trade less and trade quality signals. In this senario i would hope that cable would give us another short signal soon. Hopefully a sharper angle this time. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Can anyone confirm that a new short signal might be forming soon?? both 4 and 13 have crossed up over the 50ema, but price action shows down. Waiting for 4 and 13 to cross back down. Daily stoch still shows down, and 4hr stoch starting to reach a peak. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hey Vynner What is your experience going short with this method versus going long? I ask this because GBP has been trending upward for a longtime, I would imagine shorting is more risky and less profitable overall?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
i am not vynner and cant answer for him, but i wld guess you shd follow the system.. you start bucking the system, it aint a system any longer..

--- 帖子 #363 ---
shd be long on next candle shdnt it? 13 ma has jus crossed 50

--- 帖子 #364 ---
But the daily stoch still shows down

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Going short is no more or less risky. As long as you are using the filter, that being the daily stochastic indicator and are placing a trade that is confirmed by that trend. The cable does have the 4 and 13 crossing in a long direction, yes, but the daily is showing a downtrend so a trade here would be against the longer term trend...always risky. As far as shoring in general you are essentially always shorting one of the currencies no matter what you position. Buy the GBP and you are selling the dollar.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Is it going to be SHORT ? Just happened to come across this threat. This is my 2cents. 1ST, set MACD 8,17,9. This is more sensitive than the standard setting. On 4H chart, price rejection at 61.8 fibo. MACD divergence on 15min chart. Stoch 13,5,5 4H hs arrived at overbought and beginning to turn down. At this point, MACD 5M, 15M, 30M, 1H are all crossed down. When 4H also cross down, all system go SHORT . 1D is down. 13/50 crossed at this pointbut, 50 is flat and 1.5H to close of bar - will see where the close is when complete. Mean time, be patient. Good luck. Many pips to all.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
This is not a threat, just a stern warning...sorry, couldn't resist. No offense, but this thread is dedicated to a specific system, the set up and results thereof. I appreciate your 2 cents and will look at that set up becuase I am always curious, but for the sake of this thread we try to stick with a discipline that is outlined here and getting distracted by alternate theories can be confusing. Again, I am not doscounting your system, just wishing you would confine your comments to the system dictated by the thread.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Has anyone here tried this system on other pairs? It looks like a trigger is setting up on the USDCHF if anyone was interested. I may take a demo trade to test if the signal keeps developing.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
just check out usd/chf ..looks like a formation there...maybe you should back tested it and see if its a good idea...anyway..keep us update with that pair!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi VyNNer Enclosed please see attached chart on GBPUSD. The EMA 3 and EMA14 crossed EMA 50 and on the daily chart %D is above %K =&gt; it is signal for short based on the swing trade strategy rules. If we enter on the very candle (1.9714) when the EMA 13 crossed EMA 50, we will be stop out in the next 2 candles (SL is 1.9764)... May you kindly share with your experience how to overcome this...I do notice the %K and %D angle is still widen open and it indicates bullish... Thanks..

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Would you attach its *.mq4 include its chart, Because i'm newbie here. Thanx.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
why u enter on 1.9714 for short ??

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi all I have read this forum and like this method so started to trade it. A question as I'm having a blank moment. If you get a long trigger on the 4hr chart like we have now it is a no entry because the daily stoch are set for a short trigger, however they are now starting to look like they may possibly cross over for the bulls soon. If this happens will that be a trigger to enter as the 4hr is already set or do we need to wait for the daily first then the 4hr trigger.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I thought I just follow the rules of the strategy.. In the 4hrs chart EMA 13 and 4 cross over EMA 50 and %D is above %K in the daily chart ...so I go for short at 1.914... Did I understand correctly(or I am wrong)...anyway, it is sad to sit down and do nothing to see the price movement when up by 100pips...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi VyNNer Must we wait for both slow stoichastic in the 4hrs and daily chart to be in sync before pull our trigger ??That is if %D is above %K in 4hrs chart, in order for us to pull the trigger, the %D must be also above %K in daily chart....it seems to me the above mentioned setup is required when I papertraded this strategy...

--- 帖子 #376 ---
You probably have a good point there. In general, when trading against the long term trend, it is best to take smaller profits and get out when signs are pointing against you. A system, traded against the trend, will have different characteristics. In my experience, most good traders do not follow their system to the letter. Their experience and knowledge guide them, and everyone's experience is different. Trading is definitely an art. Recurring advice from the old timers hammers the points: 1. Trade with the trend. 2. Watch what is happening in real time. 20/20 hindsight for me, but simple stuff for the astute and nimble trader. They would have been wary of this week's trade, going against the trend. In fact, I think I mentinoed that, but then stuck with the system rules, and lost. Had I been properly respectful of the trend, i.e. looking to get out with 1/3 to 1/2 of the normal expected profits, I might have heeded the hammer and doji on the 4 hour, or the reverse head and shoulders breakout on the 1 hour - both strong signs that it was time to take profit in a counter-trend trade.

Against the trend

--- 帖子 #378 ---
With the trend. Works a lot better

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I thought about getting out on that 4 hr hammer, too, and reminded myself that this was not a candlestick reading system. Next thing you know, I would be looking at fibs, rsi, pivot points, etc. So, I left it alone. In this case we would have been smart to get out. Maybe not next time. If our money mgt is sound we can deal with these inherent losses.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Have you backtested the system with trend in mind? Here's the Feb 02 trade. I'm reading around 100 pips. With the trend.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
That market looked a little sideways to me. In hindsight it was down, but before the trade it looked ranging. I would have followed the stochs. Not to say the way you are looking at is not a good idea. It may be worth a back test. You would need to set up some criteria to give you a straight answer on which way the market is trending at any given time before you make a trade.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Very good points. It's always soooo easy to analyze after the trade is over, right?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I was very eager to get out when I was sitting at a 47 pip profit when price hit the sup level at 9600. In fact my gut was telling me to cash out due to the round number but I stuck to the rules. In this case, that 47 pip profit turned into a 50pip loss. However, that is the nature of following a simple system with simple rules. The more I "add" to it, the more I get off track. Next thing you know, I'm always taking profit at 20-50 pips and constantly missing the 150+ runs, which is the whole point of following this system.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Pretty much my same exact experience/thought process. I still think the really good traders know when to get out. Following their gut is probably a big part of it, but they also have the ability to see things happening in real time the way I do in hindsight. I talked to one of these guys on the phone yesterday for several hours, which gave me a slightly different way of thinking.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
remenber watch the daily and if u like u can long it after SL seem worth it as i got 100+ right now

--- 帖子 #386 ---
The daily chart indicates short until this very moment (%D above %K)... Of course, you can choose to trade againt trend....

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Vyn, currently GBP/USD 4 hour has both 4,13 EMA's above 50 EMA, and the Daily stochs look set to cross to a long signal. would this be classed as a trade opportunity (once the cross on the daily is confirmed) or is it only when the Daily stochs are already long THEN the EMA's cross? ryan

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hello everybody! Newbie here. Thanks for sharing what looks to be a great swing strategy with us,VyNNer! I know you use this strategy for Cable only, but it looks like the USDCHF is setting up nicely for a short position. The 4ema is getting ready to cross the 50,the 13 looks set to cross the 50 too (some time tomorrow perhaps)and the daily stochs look as though they'll dip as well.I'll be waiting for the set up confirmation and I'll keep you posted. Any thoughts,anyone?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I am quite new to trading, with only 3 months experience thus far, so my thoughts are just newbie thoughts but may reflect what I have heard on this board from others. One solution would have been to cash out with one lot, and move the stop loss a little closer with the other lot. Everything was telling me to cash out, but I stuck to the rules of the system. Now I think agonizing over this loss is a complete over-reaction, because losses are just the cost of doing business. But so many threads have popped up lately about trading with the trend, that I just thought it was unwise to take the trade against the trend and blamed the loss on that. I still don't know how to balance my discretion with the rules of a system I follow. I also thought, as a novice, I was at fault for not positioning my stop loss closer. This was also the first time I did a live trade with this system, and it was a loss. I did a few demo trades that were all big winners. This annoyed me, but I had told myself before that I will probably experience a loss the first time, as the system seemed due for a loss. I had psychologically accepted all the possibilities beforehand, except for the possibility that it would go my way and then reverse. That just felt like a slap in the face, I felt like I was violating the rule "don't let a winner turn into a loser." But much more experienced traders stuck to the rules and also lost on this trade. Even though it was a losing trade, I just want to assure myself I did the right thing by following the rules because the rules create the edge of the system. Or is the edge not in the system, but in the skills of the trader and his discretion?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
False alarm on USDCHF using VyNNer's method!! Sorry guys. Looks like ema's veered away at the last minute. Will keep on the lookout for Cable, after all, VyNNer said he only uses this strategy on Cable. Oh well...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Good idea. Analyze, don't agonize. The trend will help. I think a person should be much quicker to take profits on a trade against the trend. Different people have expressed different opinions on this, but I don't know by reading a post which are successful and which aren't. My opinion, again, is that the good traders are highly discretionary, trading is an art, each person makes a method their own. To me, stop losses are for catastrophes. You have to have one. But placing it too close is a good way to lose every trade, in my opinion. You cannot time every trade perfectly, therefore most will move against you. A close stop will almost always get hit. But, two days ago, a very successful trader told me I was wrong. He watches price action, picks his entry, and keeps a tight stop. Cliche's are easy to say. There are lots of them out there, and they will just confuse. Look back over the charts and you'll see that many successful trades following this system went into loss before winning. Most of the big wins were probably in and out of profit a few times. That's why there's a 50 pip S/L, which VyNNeR says rarely gets hit. I think it's discretion, good traders know when to break the rules. Hoss is the exact opposite, he would say that a good trader always sticks to the rules. We're both right. Every person will arrive at what works for them. I think it takes about 2 years from what I've gathered from those who have made it.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Excellent post!

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thanks! Now if I could just make some money with all this freaking wonderful wisdom.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Ha! Well, the good thing is, the odds are back on our side for the next one. I think somebody posted that they were 17-7 on this system since September. Right around 70% - nice edge.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Them's good statistics by any measure, and a good argument for sticking to the rules. I've just been having a problem taking profits, and letting nearly every trade go into a loss. I always think every trade is going to be the big one. So my discipline for the next week or two is to take the profits when there's a nice one. You changed your tag line. You do come up with some great ones!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Yeah, I used to have that problem, too, with discretionary systems. I am way better off with mechanical. It's whatever suits you individually the best. I am a strict disciplinarian, so that trading style is best for me. I trade less, and have been more profitable since I admitted this to myself. I also trade on the larger timeframes now. I didn't realize David Lee Roth was such a philosopher!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Me again... Something realy is happening in USDCHF. Earlier on I reported a false alarm, but lo and behold, we might have the makings of a good VyNNer Swing Trade set-up here.Just waiting on the 13EMA to cross the 50EMA.Daily stochastics confirm.My next 4hr candle is in 1 hour and 20 minutes' timeJust biding my time on this one. I'll let you all know how it unfolds. Later!

--- 帖子 #398 ---
The 13EMA just crossed the 50. I'm not waiting for the next candle...GOING IN!!

--- 帖子 #399 ---
anyone long now?....its a good setup now.. and stoch daily has crossed... 1 question...will monday still be bullish?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
For me the long signal occured on 4/10 with the cross. I ignored the signal due to the daily stoch rule. However, that seems to have been a bad choice as this is turning out to be a nice trade. Much better the previous short signal I took, which was validated by the daily stoch, and resulted in a loss. When I did my backtesting, I took every entry regardless of the daily stoch and still had great results. I'm thinking I may adopt that moving forward and perhaps take partial profits at certain points when the daily stoch is against my trade direction...?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I'm using a Spread Trading platform, so my numbers will differ slightly from other platforms,the price I see on the charting system is +-56-60 points more than on my trading platform,cos the "spread provider" adds their own shading to maximise their profits, but I went short on USDCHF at 1.2119 just as that big red candle formed(just before 13EMA crossed the 50 ) and 1.2091 (when 13EMA did cross).SL was set at 50 pips on both. Just when I thought I jumped the gun on this one,I scalped 32 pips on the first trade and I'm keeping the second trade alive. Second trade currently up 17 pips.I'm hesitant to leave the trade 'til maturity as it were because I know this type of swing is meant for Cable. Thus far,though, it looks as if VyNNer's strategy could work for other currency pairs, but it's difficult for me to say cos I usually trade in commodities AND I spread trade.The margin for error is great and I've become accustomed not to leave trades open overnight in this spread game...the leverage is too rich for my blood! This is one of the few forays I've taken into forex. VyNNer's strategy convinced me to try it again!!So far I'm not dissapointed. Thanks again VyNNer!

long? long on what mate? why are cryptic posts coming on here !

--- 帖子 #403 ---
bugs, wld it be possible to post ur back tests? or at least which pairs you tested? thanks

Just so you know, these aren't the original system rules.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
VyNNer's Swing Strategy well underway in USDCHF.Check out attached chart. As for Cable, it looks like we'll have to be patient and wait for another set up. Last valid long entry was on 10 April.Could be quite some time before the next entry.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I have been reading this thread for some time now and actually took the last trade where a lost of 50 pips were recorded. Could you please explain as to why it was a long signal on 10 April, because my daily Sto was still pointing down? Thanx Eben

--- 帖子 #407 ---
am aware hoss.. was wondering which pair that poster was mentioning long abt

--- 帖子 #408 ---
soooooo...... when the 4 &amp; 13 EMA crossed 50 the other day, the daily stoch was not confirming long.... does this mean you enter when the daily stoch finally crosses to long if the 4/13 EMA on the 4 hour is still above the 50 EMA? i did anyway, but whether you can comment from experience Vynner if this is standard practice for you or not, or whether it's too late in the move to be worthwhile? i'm up 70 pips at the moment so it's looking good... not too far away now from a 12 month high though.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
for those looking elsewhere the EUR/JPY looks like it's setting up.. worth a look monday.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
It looks as if the u/j is about to cross. only waiting for the 13.Since i only took 1 trade with this system, could somebody please confirm that the setup is correct? Thanx Eben

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I believe it is a correct set-up, however we have to wait for the close of the current 4h bar. Vynner said he uses this method on GU only

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Thanx for the reply. I am planning to trade other pairs on demo to try and determine their profitability with this system. I also only trade the g/u life Eben

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Eben. Regarding the 10 April "signal":The last valid signal was to go short Cable. Thought the 10 April signal was valid to go long. my apologies, you're right. It had all the ingredients for this strategy but the daily filter wasn't o.k.4EMA and 13 EMA crossed on the 4hr. Checked the 4hr chart only. Difficult to backtest the daily on the charting system available to me. I only read about VyNNer's strategy two days ago and I've really been impressed with it so far.I've made my first trade with it yesterday and shorted the USDCHF and to my surprise scalped 32 pips on the first 4hr candle! The other short is still going.Trying to stick to ALL the rules this time. I'll see how that pans out. Good luck with your trading.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
H Doji Star. Well done on the USD/CHF. I took 40 pips of it on TEB63 system just to see it drop another 100 pips lol. The only way to see if a strategy is successful is to stick to the rules, no matter what. Good luck on the USD/CHF Eben

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Ryanmel. Thanks for the heads up.Will follow the EURUSD with interest next week. I think the attached charts show that Ebenst and howard have hit the nail on the head when they said the USDJPY looks to be setting up nicely. I remember VyNNer talking about the ANGLE of the EMA crossings in an ealrier posting and this one looks as though it 'll cross at a good angle. It might just be me and I'm no expert, but it might just be that the EURJPY 4EMA and 13EMA are too far from the 50?You think it'll get closer come next week? It looks to me like the upward trend in this pair is going to continue for a while.The daily stochs look close to unravelling a bit too. Ive learnt from more senior traders (someon this thread) that the stochs can stay in an oversold position for days even weeks in a trend. Just thought it would be worth your while to have a look at the USDJPY as well. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I hear you howard. That is why I've been more hesitant and quick to grab profits with any pair that's not Cable, but some of the set ups look really good (like the current USDJPY). Has anyone backtested VyNNer's strategy on the Euro pairs?The success rate should be good there because I've noticed that the EURUSD and Cable move close together, not really in synch though,but close enough, they always follow the same trend. Only thing is Cable's moves are much bigger.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Doji Star. Yes, the STO can stay aversold/bought for quite some time.But it can also reverse just as fast. I used to trade the a strategy on 1 hour where i bought above oversbought and sold below oversold. After a few months i was back on b/e and stopped trading overbought/sold on STO. I looked at the charts and the EUR/JPY might still be a good sell next week. When you look at the seperation between MA's it is basically the same as where the USD/JPY was. However, i dont think about this trade as anything can still happen. The only reason why i looked at the USD/JPY is because all the rules except the last cross has already happened. Only waiting for confimation then i will go short Eben

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thanks for the heads up on the $yen!! Looks really good...I'm licking my lips already!! The swissy short was a profitable trade,but I too let it run away from me. After scalping 32 pips in the very first 4hr candle, I closed the other short I had open earlier ,took 24 more pips, but left a lot on the table!Didn't have time for a posting then.But hey!! 56 pips in two days is not half bad! Glad to hear you profited from the swissy too. Initially I thought I was putting my foot in it by posting the possibility of it here!! A bit reluctant to let it run it's course though, I'm sure VyNNer has his reasons for only using this on Cable only.Might be the bigger moves on Cable. Can't wait for a good cable set up. I think then I'll follow the strategy to the tee. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
My 4 hour candle on usd/jpy just closed. was sitting with my finger on the trigger. Suspense was building and...... no cross lol. The next 4 hour candle is to close to the weekend for me so i am done with trading for today. Didn't make any pips today but didn't lose any as well. Good day at the office. Enjoy the weekend everybody and again thanx VyNNer for a posting this strategy Eben

--- 帖子 #420 ---
USDJPY LOOKS AWFULLY CLOSE TO CROSSING NOW! Could even cross during this candle or the next. D'ya think we should short it (when it crosses of course) with the weekend pending? Anything can happen over a couple of days, political or otherwise. By the way,I shorted the USDCHF AS the 13 crossed the 50.It worked out ok in the end. Should I wait 'til the next candle or just trade it like I see it? Doji Star

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Ebenst Looks like you answered both my questions b4 I could even ask it!! If you had your finger on the trigger, you trade AS the 13 crosses the 50 and not on the opening of the next candle. Thanks and enjoy the weekend.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Doji Star. If i am correct then the opening of the candle would have confirmed the cross. If you trade on the close then you would be 4 hours late in the trade. Please also note that i had only one trade with this strategy wich was stopped out. By no means am i an expert on this strategy. I just try to follow the rules as stated So anything i say needs to be confirmed or corrected by more experienced traders or the originator himself Eben

--- 帖子 #423 ---
GU made me 100 pips today using this strategy ... got in @ 1.9757, TP @ 1.9857 Anyone w/similar results?? Or are y'all letting this one run? I know the strategy says to wait until the 4EMA crosses the 13EMA again to TP, but I just couldn't resist... Has anyone backtested with a TP of 100??

Can Anyone Tell Me What Exactly Does Cable Mean. I Keep Hearing It And Don't Have A Clue What That Means.

GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Haven't backtested TP100. Currently using an incremental stop, -50 up to +100, breakeven stop at +101 to +200 and locking in +100 at &gt;=+201. The 4x13 cross exit used as per rules, in the meantime. I use 13,3,3 (rather than 13,5,5) on the daily filter just to make it a little more sensitive, again not backtested. I'm in long GBP/USD 1.9720 on the 10th April and so far the trade has peaked at +166 pips, so stop now at breakeven. I'm forward testing: U/C, E/U, U/J and E/J. Live trading G/U only at the moment. VyNNer, thanks for a great method.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Sounds interesting Chow... Please post your results !

--- 帖子 #428 ---
nacho..how did you get in at 1.9757.. no cross at all then..

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi, allow me to share a tinny comment : 1. Since EMA 4 is basically glued to the candle, might as well not use it, see the candle when it breaks the EMA 14 basically the same as EMA4 crossing EMA 14. 2. THe Stoch 13,5,5 is used in the daily chart but I notice when there is short rebound (4 - 5 days), the stoch does not recognize this. Why not use 5,3,3? By the way , my metatrader only have stochastic, it does not give me the option of slow and fast. What is the difference? Eddy

--- 帖子 #430 ---
i did tested this strategy today for the firest time,but with mine own modification,stoch(10.3.3)then i add aADX indicator,i did inter when ema4 cross ema 13. on 4tf. today on jpy i did exited when ADX showing crooss doawn,on 4tf.you will see on image notice i got early signal from ADX for reserval , +90 pips.same thing with chf, lets test more pairs regards

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I got in a bit late...Original signal for me (i.e. on the open of the next candle after the 13 EMA finally crossed the 50) was around 1.9747 (take a look at the crosshair on the H4 chart). When did u get the signal?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I have never looked at this thread before... but now that I do, I can tell you this is basically the same system as Rob Booker 5-13-62 system !!! It is a great system too... and your filters are great !! I am going to check this out more because Rob Booker does not have the filters you mention in the first post. This system will work well with lots of pairs and in any timeframe !!!

--- 帖子 #433 ---
i got the same result too..but my TP was set to 80pips only..too bad

No signals in the near future. We are waiting for another cross of the 50 ema which looks like it could be a while!

--- 帖子 #441 ---
If anyone is still in this from the last cross, congrats! You are up over 300 pips. I just wish I had the stomach to stay in that long I had to bail at +120

I have been reading the thread with interest and I am not sure if anyone has already suggested this or not but its easier to place a MTF stoch set at 1440 on the 4hr chart so you can see the daily stoch without flipping backward/forward all the time. Just makes life a little easier. You can still have the 4hr stoch on the chart as well Richo Attached File(s) MTF Stochastics.mq4 4 KB | 409 downloads

It looks as though the USD/JPY is stting up for a short. We have the STO down on daily and just waiting for the 13 to cross the 50, which should happen after the current 4 H bar closes. Eben

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Anyone going to short USD/JPY...EMA 13 is going to close 50SMA real soon...

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Since i have not backtested this pair i will only short it on micro account. The originator only trade this on GBP/USD so i think we should be careful of other pairs at first Eben

--- 帖子 #446 ---
...had my eye on U/J too, my chart's last 4hr period closed out at 12pm (UK time) without a 13/50 cross, very close though. Will check again just before 16:00.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
My 4Hour closed with cross and i went short. Up 20 pips now Eben

--- 帖子 #448 ---
...stopped in short now at 118.23

--- 帖子 #449 ---
thanks for the system!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
...stopped out for -50. Next.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi Chowclown Did you input 50ema instead of 50sma??? I made that mistake earlier (thinking that 13ema is only going to cross 50sma)earlier till I saw the post of Ebenst at 5.08pm (GMT+0).... My entry was 4hrs late but manage to get out +50pips .

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I'm using the 50ema, as per VyNNers rules in post 1. The different data feeds people are using accounts for different ema crosses. Nicely done on the +50.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
...a quick (untested) observation on the daily chart trendline. The closer the pending 4hr set up is to breaking a 45(ish) degree trendline on the daily, seems to deliver better trades. Akin to VyNNeR's comments on the angle of the 4hr ema slopes. Just tried uploading a chart, but keeps failing.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I think this may be one of those months where you only get one or two trades the whole month on the Pound according to the original rules. Oh well. Keeps you disciplined anyway!

--- 帖子 #455 ---
is this a valid short or long? please look at current chart. ema4 has just cross ema50.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
...ideally we're looking for the 13 to cross the 50 too, to set up a short.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
i assume you're looking at the 4hr GBP/USD chart... no this is not a valid short or long signal. the 4/13EMA's have crossed which would be a valid exit signal if you were in long. these two EMA's need to cross the 50EMA and the daily stoch has to be showing short/long depending on the direction of the cross for a valid entry signal... take a re-read of the rules in post #1 to clarify, but this is my understanding. all the best

--- 帖子 #458 ---
not GU.i'm backtesting it with EUR/JPY. what i seen on 4hr chart is that ema4 is crossing ema50 already, and ema13 is looking to cross as well maybe in 2-3 next candles.if this happen,is it a long or short signal?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Short.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I just read this entire thread. Nice 350 pip move on the pound if you took it and followed the rules. You should be exiting right about now after 8 days of pip fun. There's been no discussion of position sizing and money management. How much are you guys risking per trade on a 50 pip stop loss? 2% of equity? 5%? This is important. If you're risking 5% (quite a bit), a $5,000 account should risk no more than $250. At $5/pip, the correct position size would be 5 mini-lots. I hope you guys are not going full out on the leverage. I'd like to hear from VyNNer on this. Great system.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
If you followed the rules, you would have not taken this trade unfortunately. Stochs were still pointing down on daily chart in this instance.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
what do you really mean by that chow ?? i just don't get it ?? sorry if i don't understand it maybe i'm a little bit slow but perhaps a picture can describe well Yupp.... you're right btw where's Vynner ?? hmm i think this strategy can well implemented on eur/usd too.... i think it also show a good result on that pair

--- 帖子 #463 ---
...sorry, clear as mud. Trades signalled when the daily trendline is being tested, when the trendline slopes around 40-45 degrees, may have a higher probability of success....just a thought. Still can't upload a pic.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Right on! I followed the rules and missed this one. Followed the rules on the prior entry and got stopped out. But that's how you trade, and you never know which trade will be the big winner. I mentioned earlier that when I did my backtesting, I ignored the D stoch filter and took every cross. Still had very good results. I need to go back and look at how many trades now would have been excluded if I followed the D filter.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Let me know how you make out!

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I'm not new to the post, but this is my first time replying. Based on the rules, GBP looks to be nowhere near a short. Does anyone have any short-term trading strategies, using a simular technique, that we can use while we wait?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Remember this post about the double EMA? Had you placed this on the screen approx. eight days ago( 4 hour chart), you would have seen where the DEMA and the 13 &amp; 50 EMA all crossed at the same place...got in there and rode that pony to the tune of 459 ticks....This happened in Feburary as well for another 400 odd ticks. Now here's the question, My platform will only allow me to go back to late December ( 4 hour charts). Is there anyone game enough to look further back and see how often this happens? Thanks for your help, Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Better yet, if you go back 10 days ago, ( swiss franc, 4 hour chart)you will see where ALL FOUR CROSSED AT THE SAME TIME!!! Good Trading Ladies &amp; Gents, Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Robert - can you clarify? The post you reference is talking about using that indicator to get an earlier exit. It seems you are referring to using it as another entry signal??

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I'm using 1% - 1.5%.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Bugscoe, You are correct in the mentioned post and the exit signal strategy. After I had placed the DEMA on a 4 hour chart and did some minor back testing, it was clear to me that from a entry prospect, the signal had real possibilities. I have looked back on the four main markets and it appears only on USD/JPY, the signal lost money. I am not suggesting that this signal is something to live by, however it does appear to be another tool to add to ones arsenal. Have a great weekend, Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I still do not see DEMA indicator

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Could you please share .ex4 of your template or explain on how to set it up on the chart

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Somebody kindly posted this a while ago, but it was deleted as a result of the hacking situation. Could somebody please post it again? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
if you have Dealbook from gftforex the DEMA indicator is included... maybe some superstar can work out how it works and write an indicator for those of you not using dealbook.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
from http://www.forexrealm.com/technical-...ential-ma.html Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) formula is:- (2 * n-day EMA) - (n-day EMA of EMA) how you get metatrader to calculate it I haven't a clue.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I did find this indicator for MT4, it has a setting for many MA types of which one is DMA, whether or not its what is being talked about here I am unsure Richo

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Sorry I meant DEMA Richo

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks. But i always have problem to compile the .mq4 file. Can anyone tell me how to get the compiler work in MT4? Anytime i try to compile the .mq4 it gives error unable to lunch the compiler.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Have you made any progress on your EA for this system? If it is done, I would be happy to forward test it for you. Thanks. Virgil

--- 帖子 #481 ---
well i encounter the same problem you must fix it uninstall your MT4 and select repair it works for me i can launch my compiler hope this help

--- 帖子 #482 ---
As Rob (blueruby) did such a fantastic job on his indicator v1.2, I decided to add to it (actually, I rewrote about 95% of it, but he laid the foundation) and create an arrow indicator system based on the rules that VyNNer has laid out. I've attached the source. You know what to do with it. Looks like there are some fantastic trades that have been available! Couple of notes: This has NOT been tested live, as I just started this yesterday and have not got into trading tonight at all, so please look for bugs!! Again, the goal is to have a popup appear when a new bar forms, but as the market's only been open a few hours, I have not tested it yet to see if that happens, as no trade opportunities are available now. As always, PLEASE use common sense and do not blindly follow the arrows! While I was once a professional software developer, this is my first MQL code, and the first code I've written in about 6 months, so just keep your eyes peeled! :-) This indicator will display long, short, and exit arrows (the red 'x'), and will email you notification, show a popup on the screen, play a sound, and even call your mother and leave her a computer generated voicemail letting her know that you've made the big bucks on this trade (okay...maybe not the last one hehehe). I have included an option to turn on/off the daily stochastic filter (it's off by default). If you put this on the g/u 4hr chart, you'll see very few losing trades compared to big winners with the stoch off. EDIT: small update about 10 mins after I posted this to shut the indicator up the first time you load it (if you're switching profiles from one to this and have 15 charts open, you would have gotten a lot of email/console spam).

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Some interesting prospects to follow this week. EUR/JPY might rollover today/tomorrow. Could be a good trade if the daily trendline breaks...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
GBP/USD away to go yet, but there's tradeable clearance down to the daily trendline once/if it signals....

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Can you be kind to compile and give us .ex4 version of the indicator. I can't still compile from meta editor

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi JoshDance Thanks for the indicator. I did put it up on the G/U and noticed that it gives you the signal one candle to late. Regards Eben

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Can Someone assist on how to get th compiler work on Meta trader. I have uninstall and repair yet it is not working

--- 帖子 #488 ---
There seems to be some lag at some points, as there are gray areas where an EMA dips to touch another, and when they all get intertwined it's not best used, just like the method itself. However, in most cases the indicator follows the rules pretty clearly. Look at 4/16/07, for example. The rules say that when the 4 and 13 pass the 50, then open on the NEXT candle open (in other words, wait for them to close above the 50). That's just what it does in this case. Two candles earlier is very very close to the 50 but likely not above it just by a fraction, and the previous candle the lines are clearly above, and then the signal is given on the next candle, as per vynner's method. Can you give me a specific example of where the indicator is a bar too late?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
...there has been confusion on the thread before, about whether to wait for the crosses to be confirmed (using crosses on Closing prices) or not. I think VyNNeR enters earlier, at the open of the candle where the cross is taking place....

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I believe VyNNer's entry point is actually as and when the 13 crosses the 50 (the 4 would've either crossed or would be busy crossing the 50). This and this alone makes it a very difficult strategy to backtest accurately.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
"When the EMA4 first cross the EMA50 follow by EMA13 cross the EMA50, with a new open candle , place your entry with a stop loss of 50pips." This is from the original post. He may enter earlier, but this was the original system. We can at least back test it this way so there is no discretion.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
...ideally we need VyNNeR to put this to bed once and for all. My interpretation of his first post was the same as yours initially, but he has subsequently posted clarification (against charts in the thread) where it appears he means entries should be taken when a new candle opens with the 13 crossing the 50....as the cross is taking place. I backtested GBP/USD (tick data 2005) on the closing cross scenario and it wasn't profitable...don't know about other years....

--- 帖子 #493 ---
That sucks. Seemed like it worked. I don't know that this small change would affect it that much if the testing is showing negative for '05.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Did the tick data take into account the Daily Stoch filter? Just checkin'.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
VyNNeR: "Remember you do not neccessary wait for the EMA13 to fully cross the EMA50 to have a valid entry. Sames go to the EMA4 and EMA13 on the exits. " I don't know which post it was in, but I cut this and pasted it into my compilation document of this method.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Okay--I'm doing some testing on my indicator right now and have already made a couple of changes. I'm dealing with repaint issues and the like right now so bear with me while I try to get it as accurate as possible. And yes, backtesting will be impossible to do accurately if we go by the tick that the MA lines cross. But we can approximate it I guess.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Hello Robert, I am lucky to find someone on VTT as well. Can you please advise me how is your setting of the stochastic?..I use the "Full Stochastic Oscilator" Right now I have K period 13, Kslowing period 5, K slowing method Simple, D period 5, D method Simple .. Is this ok?.. I am still a bit confuzed by all the indicators being sligtly different in all platforms, and I am a newbie as well:-) Thanks a lot!!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thanks for the indicator Josh, it has made my job easier. I have attached a simple risk return calculator (unfortunately I have no idea on how to convert xls to xml therefore I was unable to upload as attachement, so a screenshot will have to do for now) Based on signals generated from Jun 30 2006. Wherever a loss greater than 50 pips was generated I have set it to a maximum of 50pips (the suggested stop loss). I guess this is often the difficult area in risk management. Some of the exit crosses may occur during announcements and move quickly against one, or at other times I noticed a postion was entered on a Friday only to be "gapped" out on a Monday etc. The sample contains about 38 trades, a larger sample may give greater confidence, although with risk management of 7% per trade this gives a maximum draw down of less than 20% which I generally find acceptable and leads to a profitable position (based on the past perfomance of these few trades) Looking forward to any comments

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hi Hoss, no it didn't, it was tested purely on the ema crosses (on close) - has anyone else done any testing using the filter? It's a profitable method on the face of it, in current conditions, would be useful to get a feel for the drawdown characteristics over a more representative period.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
...trendline break on the daily chart, stochs rolled over and the 4hr setting up...strong pullback likely first though perhaps...

AUD/USD both MAs has crossed 50 Anybody short on this pair?

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Given the initial thrust down, I'll be waiting for the retracement to exhaust itself, coupled with a definitive 13/50ema cross on the 4hr. This one may turn out to be a good example of when it's best to wait for ema cross confirmation, for a better R:R trade...time will tell.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
does anyone has a result trading this method on other pair ??

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I am. curious to see how it works out.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Dear all traders, Has been a long while i wrote something on this thread. I believe many of you are trying to work this strategy on other pairs. And also got to thank those who wrote a EX4 for this strategy too. Keep up the good work. I have made some good pips once with AUD/USD with this exact swing strategy. Therefore i think it should work out ok, please try to forward test further. Anyway overall my 3 different ways to trade forex has made another consistent month for me. Hope everyone is doing fine too. In March it was really a supreme month, i am up +820 pips. In April a little slow month for me, currently only up about +350 pips. Hope to get at least +400 pips by the end of the month. Best of luck to all my dearest traders too. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Yes, I'm short on it.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
AudUsd hit my SL. (50 pips)

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Yeah, -50 for me too. :-\

--- 帖子 #509 ---
looks like long AUD opp coming along. what do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Here are the results of the last 63 signals for the GBPUSD. I also tested the signals with a 100 pip profit limit, which effectively cut the profit result in half. Most losses occured during "choppy" periods, yet ignoring this and trading mechanically on every signal you will see it still produced very good results, although now showing a max draw down of 27% over this period. Just hoping the attachment uploads this time

--- 帖子 #511 ---
interesting, so do I understand right that this is only using the condition of the two crosses, enter in the candle when the second cross appears. You havent filtered the enter signals with the daily stochastic... ok?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
The results are purely based on the signals as generated by Joshdancer's custom indicator, which does not use the stoch filter. These results have been calculated manually based on the signals form the custom indicator, going forward, however, may present a much different story. In the real world one will miss many of these crosses to exit, one could re-calculate every exit loss at -50 pips for argument, so that it is becomes a true mechanical system ?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Here it is, re-calculated assuming every loss went to the maximum of 50 pips, basically the profit has halved, and the drawdown has now increased to about 37%, so it looks as though you need manual intervention. Bearing in mind the exits for profit also need to be performed manually. So one still needs to lend a "hand" to maximise this system. Your comments appreciated.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
...anyone tempted with USD/JPY?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
As far as I can see this system will make profits if: 1. You can enter and close on the signals generated 2. You can manage risk and return 3. You set an alarm in advance of of the four hour candle 4. Take action according to the rules Manual intervention is needed, to maximise this system, yet following a four hour time frame is more civilised than chasing the shorter time frames, and that is an objective in itself ? any comments appreciated fellow traders....

--- 帖子 #516 ---
...might have better luck on AUD/USD this time, if it signals....

Hi ChowClown I just entered this trade on demo.Still paper-trading VyNNer's Strategy 'til I get the hang of it...sort of a forward test.The red horizontal line on the 4hr chart shows the entry point. Daily stochs confirm short. Blue line crossing/touching 50MA. Valid entry! Thanks for the heads up! OOPS!! You can't actually see the daily stoch confirmation on the attachment! Forgot the daily chart was still in February and didn't activate 'auto scroll'! Silly me.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi ChowClown. Just got in.Saw your posts. My Aussie trade hit trailing stop for 24 pip gain. Not bad for a couple of hours. I wasn't too keen to leave the stop loss at 50 because of the recent overwhelming US$ bearishness, so I opted for the trail. For all you know,this might just be temporary pullback for this pair before the greenback bear continues. I saw the GBPUSD setting up nicely. CHECK OUT THE CHART BELOW...it's nearly there.I like this one more than the Aussie earlier because of the angle at which the 13 is going to hit the 50. Let's wait with our finger on the trigger... PS You ought to think of using MT4.That's what I'm doing,even though I use another broker for live trades.Your charting system might be lagging a little.I noticed that Interbank,although they also use MT4, lag behind MetaTrader's (MIG Investments) MT4 platform,i.e. a new candle is forming by MIG while Interbank's is still busy closing the previous candle!Go figure.

I enter at the open of the candle after the 13/50ema cross. I'm short GBP/USD from 1.9912, similar entry price to VyNNer who i think usually enters as soon as the 13 crosses the 50. Looks like I was lucky with +ve slippage this time.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
...not convinced 50 pip SL will be enough to keep us in, given the daily trendline bounce, but you never know..

Ecogates As far as I can see the daily stoch filter is still short hence a no trade according to the original rules. Are you trading the original version of this system or a variation disregarding the daily stoch filter? Tiger2

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi Tiger, You are right, the daily stoch filter is short but I decided to go long and against the original version of the system when I saw a perfect set-up ( the 3 EMA's crossing at the same point). I use VT Trader platform, my trade is currently up +37 pips. And I believe the daily stoch will soon cross to confirm this. Thank you.

Excellent trade ecogates, I run VT Trader as well. I see where all three EMA'S ( actually 4,13 &amp; 50 DEMA) crossed on the two hour chart. Is this what you were looking at or have I missed something else entirely? Robert DeCuir

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi all, I am a regular follower of this thread and seen few trades were stopped out with loss recently. So, if a trade met the stoploss with this strategy, disregard all rules and enter the opposite direction immediately and if you want, book for a profit for more than 50 pips, to gain back the loss. I visually backtested this, and seems to work. Please give any feedback. Thanks.

Good luck. I'm entering on the cross close rather than open at the moment. Big difference in our entries, 50 odd pips.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Nice system based on Daily charts to filter out possible bad trades. However, using Stoch on D1 is not sufficient to filter out bad trades when the market is "consolidating". Would it be feasible to add another indicator to filter out "consolidation"? I was thinking of MACD - enter a trade only when Daily MACD is beyond the 0.0030 levels. Likewise, we need a better "closure" signal. EMA4 and EMA50 crossing at times isnt enough. Example, this 2 weeks, I got a signal to short @ 1.9950 last Apr 26 but it was quickly stopped out after making almost 100 pips profit. Today, I got another short signal @ 1.9950 again! currently +50, what to do? Hmm.. can we use D1 signals to close out trades? ie, currently D1 is bearish, do we hold onto our short until D1 chart shows bullish stoch (or MACD) signal ?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hello BK, adding another filter is good but may also missed out opportunities. A few ways to max this system: Set a minimum distant between the 13EMA &amp; 50EMA before the signal is valid. Waiting for the Price to pull back to the 4EMA before executing serves as another "filter" for better price entry. Trailing stops to ensure pips and setting TP targets also makes this strategy good. So far using fib-Ext as targets have been ok for me. What I do is when first target is met, I would just liquidate partially and shift the rest to break-even. Times are bad..if I can squeeze out 50 pips, hey why not? I also always place a 300 pips profit target... just in case

Im currently writing an EA for this but am getting mixed results. From 2007Jan to End of April: It managed to make 10K to 20K with 0 Trailing, 300 TP, 50 SL. But with Trailing, it failed miserably! Anyone working on an EA? I sure could use some help collaborating our work.

Has anyone ever tried SHI channel and CCI for filters?... this is just a suggestion.If I am wrong please correct me.. refer to the attachment. 1. enter here 2. exit when the CCI crosses 0 ( buy = cci crosses below 0, sell = cci crosses above 0 ).I found out that you will get an earlier exit signal compared to the MAs 3. Signal came out but reversed when it touched the SHI channel 4. Same as #3

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Im a little familiar with CCI, been studying a CCI50 (on a different trend).. So what you are saying is look at D1 charts (using either Sto, RSI, MACD, MAs) to figure the trend, and then use CCI on H4 to enter? Hmm... I would agree indeed that CCI is faster than MA especially during "consolidations".

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I didn't use the cci to enter...just as a signal for exit.Its faster than the 2 MAs(2 or 3 candles faster), provided that you use the crossing of the MAs as your exit rule.I use the CCI on a 4H timeframe. Maybe during "consolidations" , you can use the SHI channel coz the candles bounce off the bottom and top channel even after the signal came out.Just my 2cent.Again, correct me if im wrong.

...stopped out for -50 right on the turn. Seen enough over the last few weeks to move to entering as the 13 crosses the 50, rather than waiting for confirmation - the 50 pip sl seems too tight if entering on the cross close. Won't be able to use the automation i'm currently using for these entries though, but then it's hardly a labour intensive method, just have to hope not too many entries are triggered when asleep. Lost 50 on yesterday's swissy long too earlier.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
chowclown.... *Warning - this is my opinion* - be careful not to change too many entry and exit rules too soon... any method needs time... otherwise you may fall into the trap of "curve-fitting"... a few weeks isn't enough time to truly test out an idea. it needs months at least. i am using the standard method laid out in post #1 and am still in short on cable and at present up 22 pips. cable trades so far for me with this method +86 (i saw resistance and exited early, waiting for the cross would have given me +207 ... no-ones perfect), and -50, and this trade.. open.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hear what your saying...due to limitations on the autotrader i'm currently using i wasn't entering in accordance with post #1 in the first place...i thought to myself, entering on the cross close wouldn't make too much difference (the 'bot is fine using closing cross data), so was prepared to run with it for a while. Seems clear to me that you have to enter as the 13 crosses the 50, to make the most from the method....as i see others are doing.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
up 50 pips now... all good. i like this method... it involves patience (i.e. waiting for the 13 to cross, the bar to close) which is something i am learning is important.

Hi, Somebody mentioned earlier that this system is similar to Rob Booker's 5/13/62 system. I do not want to confuse this thread with another system, but perhaps looking at the similarities and differences may help to make Vynner's system a little more effective. So I will outline the ideas here briefly. Essentially, Rob Booker's system is : (1) Watch for 5 EMA crossing 13 EMA (2) Then wait for 13 EMA to cross 62 EMA So far it sounds quite similar to Vynner's system. But Rob Booker also adds this : (3) Wait for the 13 EMA to continue to move approximately 30 pips away from 62 EMA in the expected direction (this obviously makes the 13/62 cross more reliable) (4) Wait for the 13 EMA to retrace near to the 62 EMA, then enter. One of the main differences between Vynner's and Rob Booker's systems is that Vynner is optimized for 4 Hour charts, but Rob Booker is optimized for much lower TF - generally around 5-30 minutes. I wonder if Rob Booker's filter (step 3) and retrace (step 4) could be useful in making Vynner's system more effective? Perhaps not, due to the difference in timeframes. Nevertheless, it may be worth checking... What do you think? Regards, Jin

I have been toying with Daily MACD to support Sto. Attached is my MACD Indicator. This indicator can be used to impose D1 MACD on H4/H1 charts. ie, you have H4 charts up, but wants to plot D1 MACD; just enter the PERIOD "D1" in the input screen.

Thanks ryanmel. My bot's 13ema was still above the 50 at that point, their feed seems quite different to the mainstream.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi, Yes, using 5/13/62 there is often one trade a day, sometimes not... Anyway discussion of that method doesn't belong here, I was just wondering if the similarities could be helpful for this system. You can read more about 5/13/62 in the message below : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=9365 Regards, Jin

Cash, I could have sworn that the market crossed on May 1st and did it again on may 2nd for the gbp/usd. Are you sure that is only made one cross on May 2nd only and not on May 1st? thanks hilton

--- 帖子 #582 ---
EMA 4 crossed EMA 50 a while ago would this be a good trade? could we possibly enter without waiting for the EMA 13 to cross EMA 50? would the holiday temporarily slow down the movement?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi traders, I've been visually backtesting this strategy and it seems it would be better to use 5,3,3 as scholastics. Also for trading any signals that system provides, I would: 1. Enter with 3 lots a) Exit 1st one with 50+ pips b) Move stop loss to break even on 2nd one c) Keep a 50 sl on 3rd any comments?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Will EMA 13 cross EMA 50 next candle? Don't forget that there is May Day in UK. Daily filter doesn't match and can continue down.

HI All, I am new to the forum and have been following this thread which has been excellent so far (Thanks to Vynnar). I have been trading equities for awhile now and just recently setup a demo account to trade forex. I have the parameters setup etc and think i have a pretty good understanding of how the system works. However i have to work a normal job during the day so my opportunity to place trades etc is limited to after 5pm EST or between 5-7am EST mon to friday. I dont have the ability to use a pda etc at my workplace and no access to my trading platform during business hours. So, is this system able to be traded at the end of day or early mornings or do i need to make trades at random times? Any advice on my situation or personal experiences would be great. Regards Stink

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hello traders, looks like we might have a long signal on gbp/usd tonight.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
System gives you 3-4 trades a month. Normally, you will see ema4 cross first, but it might take another 4 hours or more for ema13, so you have plenty of time to react.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Thanks for the response, Well i suppose the more accurate question is if the four hourly chart crossses for an entry signal and i dont get to see it till that night which could be a few hours later, is this a big drama? I am thinking worst case i lose 1 maybe 2 candles movement before i get to act on it. Regards Stink

--- 帖子 #589 ---
According to rules of the system. Daily filter is now in the direction of the long position. I opened partial long position. See the blue triangle on the chart.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
...have you tested using the 3hr entry rather than 4 hr? Similar results?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
No. I think that it won't be so important. I didn't notice that the ema4 crossed back ema50 and ema13. I should have closed the position. What do u think about it?

--- 帖子 #592 ---
From the difference between platforms/feeds etc, the only way to accurately trade the same signals as VyNNer, seems to be to use the same chart/feed. He was using GFT earlier in the thread. I have been using FXCM 's charting/feed, notice how the daily slow stoch (13,5,5) (as per VyNNer's first post) has yet to cross long....

--- 帖子 #593 ---
I know what u think. Anyway, it is impossible to get into possition at the same rate. There is always subjective point of view to the chart despite strict rules how to enter the position. So, no matter whether you use 4h or 3h candles. Or Whether you use CMS, CMC , GFT, Saxo or Oanda . I also think that it is not so important whether you use EMA 4 or EMA 5 and so on. That is my opinion. But it is not based on mathematical stats mady by comparing these variations. The important thing is an idea for me and individual interpretation of it. Reno

--- 帖子 #594 ---
...i agree, if the aim is to use the original method as an aid to developing something of your own.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
guys, sorry for interruption. just wanna share idea. the owner TS is also good. but for people who like to trade everyday,with little stay on PC try 3 abdul on 4hr chart, (5EMA,9SMA,20EMA) plus stochastic 8/3/3 u can combine it with fozzy method.(but apply it on 4hr chart) very simple. just ride the trend on ema cross....aggresive - when 5/9cross, conservative - when 5/9 cross 20 for long/short vice versa i guest the cable going down right now. (ops....i enter at 1.9944) now has move the trade to breakeven + 10 pips in bag. make life simple.40 pips a day x 20 day trading = 800pip per month = usd 8000 more than my engineer's day job salary.RM3k(in malaysia)

--- 帖子 #596 ---
thanks for sharing your method. I backtested last month visually and it seems that in some cases you need to set a pretty big stop loss just to get few pips. Unless I'm missing something. If you have time please attach a chart, I'm sure other would like to see it as well. Thanks again and good luck trading, martini

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Yeah i have been following on since the start of the thread and if i go back to past entry/exits etc i can see the same chart patterns etc on my platform. So yeah everyones charts in real time will look different due to time zones, connection speeds etc. But of the price moves according to the rules of the system the signals will form up, we just dont all see them at the same time. I think thats what's being said right? Cheers Stink

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hello All, I trade this strategy for some time now, and as I looked back, I got confuzed by my entries. As they look inconsistent. I am not posting charts, because they are confuzing when evaluating entry point when looking on history. In the first post Vynner says " When the EMA4 first cross the EMA50 follow by EMA13 cross the EMA50, with a new open candle, place your entry" IF I interpret this right it means : Look on the chart only every 4 hours when new candle forms. IF both 13+4EMAs are through slow 50 EMA, enter. (plus the daily filter, no uncertainity there) Later Vynner says something like "you dont need the 13EMA to cross fully to enter" Which may imply that the 13 and 50 may be just touching. Often when somebody posts a chart, he is told that his entry is one candle late. Problem is, that when there is a big candle, the cross may show up during the timespace of the candle, than the candle may extend itself quicky in the direection of the trend and- graphically, the cross moves a bit to left, so it looks like it is too late, but at the begining of the candle, there was no cross. Therefore my fundamental question is : Is this a "look every 4 hours for entry" system? Or do i need to stick my eyes to the charts after the 5EMA crosses and jump in as soon as the 13 and 50 touch? Thanks. I like this system, everything is nice, just the entrys are tricky... Elm

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Yes - if you're following the rules, ie 4hr charts, not 3hr and use the daily slow stoch filter, in the end the difference between feeds/charting is likely to be cancelled out.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Can you tell me how to set the EMA settings? I'm kind of new to all this...is it in the MACD settings or the moving average...

--- 帖子 #601 ---
The first post of this thread has it all.. there is no MACD in this strategy. You may use my templates (for MT4) if you wish to... vynner4H goes on 4H and the day-add goes to 1D. I believe MA and Stoch are part of the basic set of indicators in MT4. Elm Anyway.. can anybody please answer my question?.. how is it with the waiting for a new candle or jumping in..... thanks

--- 帖子 #602 ---
hi guys i am new to this. i read the first page about the system. i have a couple of questions please. i understand the EMA set up but how do we know if it is a long or short entry. does it depend on the color of the candle that opens if it is a bull or a bear. Also What if the EMAs cross in the middle of a 4 hour period . Another question is ( sorry for asking so many questions but i am trying to understand the system correctly) i have a MT4 platform so the schotistic oscillator entry is 13,5,5. so %k is13 and %D is 5 correct?.The price field should be low/high or close/close. Last question , On the schotstic chart one line is slower than the other so which one is %k and %D respectively. The MAin or the Signal . I tried to download teh attatchments in the previous post but my computer is giving me problems. Thankyou in advance for any help.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
That was just what I wanted to suggest.. Read the first page once more, really everything is there, the rest I am afraid is experience (which I dont have) DOnt care which line is which.. look at a chart and you will see which indicates an uptrend and which a dountrend.. find the example charts that are at the begining, find them the time in past of your charts and make the indicators look the same.. or download my attachements.. should work ok, Ill check.. find directory called "templates" in your MT4 folder and restart platform, should be in the Charts/Tamplates menu elm ps. I checked, works ok, leftclick- save to disk, or something like that.. (i use firefox) or rightclick, save target as (I guess in Explorer)

Anyway.. for the experienced guys ... can anyone please answer my question from the previous page???thanks

--- 帖子 #608 ---
This probably has been answered somewhere in this thread but I've missed it. Is it possible to enter a trade much later than the initial crosses of the EMA's i.e well into a trend or does the system rely on entering as soon as the crosses are made and of course the stochastics are right? I've been trading the Vanessa FX 4hr system but as soon as the currency stops trending you get wipsawed badly and end up giving a lot back where as this system seems to avoid that for the best part. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Hi all, I have been testing this method for several weeks now, and I have a simple tip: Always put your trades as soon as you see the final cross ( ema 13, ema 50) forming, do not wait till the candle closes and a new candle forms. This will give more time to react in case any reversal and gives enough room to escape with small loss in any such event. Also in the other hand, if the cross forms and well under way, we will be in a position more in advance (sometimes 30-40pips more). Any suggestions? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #610 ---
i find that sometimes , at the exact point of official entry (when the 13 crosses the 50) it can sometimes be almost overbought , and may have a pullback just after or within the next few candles, which runs the risk of being stopped out on your 50 pips . what i tend to do is buy on a pullback and re-crossing of a... % K5 ; % D3 ; PERIOD 3 stochastic . you will get a more clearer signal of this as well if you flick back to the 2 hour chart when you use this stoch to establish your entry . it just helps to pinpoint the entry better .the 4hr chart is a very smooth flowing chart but the 2 hr entry on that stoch ensures a quality entry

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Thanks mcdonnelc, really well designed entry. will try to adopt this method from now on. Also, if any currency pairs are ready to trade, I hope it is better if anyone post here as usual, as that will help a lot. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon3.gif

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I do not think any timeframe less tham 4H suits this method, it will give more false trades leading to frequent stoplosses. Any currency pair is ok, but the more volatile pairs gives more better trades.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Everything is possible, but much writing was done here in the forum about how important it is to go in soon enough. When the signal appears to be a one big candle and then a consolidation pattern, going in late can turn a decent profit into loss... (unless you have some other proves supporting the perspective of long-lasting trend.)

--- 帖子 #620 ---
looking into my IBFX 4H chart your entry is two candles late, am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Elmer, I realised really it is a late entry, and I closed with 9 pips profit already and seeing price moving opposite now. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I trade with alpari. The price I entered with current bar is nearly same as what price I would have entered 2 bars ago. So I thought it was a pullback. How to see the difference from a pullback and reversal?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
actually the chunky bar was the one where the second cross occured.. some 140 pips :-) I got that one :-) demo :-/... I did it exactly as you suggested and also Vynner mentioned that,. as the 13 touched the 50 i was in.. and was lucky with all those news. The pullback/reverse... I think that is why the 50 pip stoploss is there... according to the system rules you should have let the trade run until it would be stopped by the S/L or it may also decide to drop down and start giving you pips... the 50S/L gives enough space for any "games" of the price at the begining before it decides , if it has not decided during the crosses elm

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Yes I was a bit confused to jump in when 13 -50 was about to touch, so I decided to enter in pullback, but not many pips. Will keep inform any other crosses. Regards.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I was trading gbp/jpy last night. The system gave an entry at 237.37, at least on Alpari UK. What I've noticed with this system and gbp/jpy is that price tends to pull back before it goes down. So I have a couple of suggestions: 1. Wait till 13 ema crosses 50 ema completely (new candles opens) 2. Once the cross occurs and new candle opens, use 5-30 min TFs to enter your trade. Don't just jump in right away. Last night I got an entry at 237.54, which is not perfect, but a little better. Currency pair made a low at 236.43, but I stuck to the rules and ended up exiting pretty much at break even. In the future I will exit 1/3 or 1/2 of my position at 50 or 100 pips profit. Those are my observations. Good luck martini

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Thanks martini, in my opinion, 4 Hour chart is already late in a trend. If you look at the 4H chart, the signal (final cross) occured at the near end of the trend. The real downtrend began on 10. 05. 2007 at 8.00am GMT (4 Hour Chart). So, if this 13-50 cross occurs at the middle or very end of a trend????? Also, I think, this method is ok for a very very long trend, and otherwise entry points has to be very carefully selected. I believe if you are trading on a big frame, no need to lose unless you are very very late on a trend according to that timeframe. Any suggestions???

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks for your feedback. I wish we could find a good way to filter the trades and enter right when the new trend is forming, but unfortunately system doesn't really work on lower TFs as it is. The only way I see it working is if we can identify the trend on 4h chart -&gt; 5 ema crosses and 13 ema is approximately 2 candles from crossing. Then we could go back to 1h chart and see if the cross of 13 ema has occurred and look for entry. In GBP/JPY example: 4H CHART 5.10.2007 // 12:00H Candle was in a downtrend and 5 ema had crossed. 13 ema was approaching 50 ema. This is where we go back to 1h chart. 1H CHART 5.10.2007 // 18:00H The entry is at 238.68 once both 5ema and 13 ema have crossed completely. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
That is much much better to consider. This way, one thing we can be early in the trend, or if a bad trade (the final cross is about to happen but not, and trend changes on 4H chart- this is the exit) early to exit. Actually, we can try this entry rules from now on and I firmly believe this will bring good trades. As most recently, I didn't see any better trades for past 2 or so weeks with original entry method. Thanks martini and elmer for your suggestions. Keeps all of us on track. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I agree, that the 1H is good to check, but still it may produce too hasty signals. So I would use the 1H check only when the second cross on 4H is almost happening and is very likely to happen in actual 4Hbar. Then it is probably good to look at the shorter timeframe and jump in that 4H bar with the cross. That would probably supply the speed of entry that VyNNer has, but we lack the experience for that:-) Anyway, I have some ideas combining this system and another system here from FF, I also am thinking about a custom indicator for that, but I need programmer. I can define the logic, but I dont know the mq4 language enough , so I keep making errors in the code which I dont know how to repair. Even though my indicator is really simple.... So anybody interested? elmer

--- 帖子 #630 ---
ok I have found a brilliant programmer :-) so now some testers will be needed:-)

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Elmer, Thanks for your effort. I am willing to be as a tester. Thasnks.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hello, the indicator can be found in this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=29419 please go there , I dont want to make mess in VyNNers thread:-) You will find that at this moment it has a form of MACD formed by DEMA averages. My first suggestion where to start is set it to 4-13-1 so we ignore the signal line and have the same periods as VyNNer. Some time ago in this thread it was suggested to use Dema for exit and re-entry.. so thats my first suggestion. Enjoy. elmer

Come on:-) its only every 4 hours, its not so bad:-) you can find systems on this thread that will alert you that a cross may be forming. But I think its better to do the entry manually, so I dont know if these systems will also open and close positions for you... go to the list of threads, on the line with the name of this thread there is a small paperclip, ther you find all the attahements in this thread elmer

Hmmm..now here's a system that I can follow. Vynner, I placed a demo trade on EURUSD yesterday 16 May that met all of the entry criteria...it was in 50 pips profit before it reversed...the EMA4 and EMA13 crossed again so I exited the trade, breaking even as I'd moved the stop up from 50pip to the entry level. I learnt that following the rules to the tee is crucial as I placed a similar trade on GBPUSD a little to early....the EMA4 had passed thru the EMA50, and the EMA13 was touching the EMA50, seemingly about to pass thru it too...I did not wait for it to do so and also didn't wait for the next candle to open before entering....the result was that the price reversed to the downside as soon as I opened the trade and it very quickly hit the 50pip stop...if I had of waited for confirmation of the EMA13 well and truly crossing over the EMA50 and for the new candle to open I would have known not to enter the trade. (I couldn't figure out how to copy and paste the oanda chart to illustrate) I will not let these first 2 trades put me off and will continue to paper trade this system until I see consistent profits. Any comments or suggestions ?

I also expect Vynner to give us all some guidance in this? Recently, no trades were happy ones. Also, does Vynner still follow this strategy - I wish to know. Great method, but catches a long trend after a while, so reversals are very common in this method.

i find i g index reasonably ok . i use guaranteed stops gbp/usd 6 pips total . but i am looking for a company that will let me send my strategy to them for them to automatically execute my trades for me (i.e when im sleeping!)i have only ever used i g index because it is spread betting and tax free and have not really trawled thru the various fx companies . but if metatrader is tax free then hat is good as well .but i want both tax free and autol trading. any suggestions?

Alpari Uk uses Metatrader platform, also you can excute your orders by placing a custom expert in that trading platform, to suit your style or method of trading. As far as I know there is no other to recommend with autotrading in UK. Or anyone knows of any other good companies based in UK, please let us know.

I now know why I entered the trades too early....I was using a 3hr chart in Oanda ( there are no 4hr chart options). When one looks at a 4hr chart for that period one can clearly see no crossover of the EMA...der... Ok, patience is the key here as I've been used to shorter term strategies....

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hi VyNNeR. You've mentioned that you also use shorter term systems and thus in total are achieving up to 1000 pips per month. Would you be so kind as to share a shorter term system that you are effectively using with us as well ?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Please enlighten us on your short term trade method/s....your results are very insipiring...!

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Dear all traders, It has been a long time I did not stop by this thread. How are you guys doing? For me so far May is the worst month for me. I'm only up about +50 pips. But I have no complaints, trading is a long term business, there are times we could not perform well with a certain strategy. I have too many people emailed me regarding the short term trading tools that i'm using. Sorry if i did not managed to reply all. Anyone interested might want to google forexproalerts and forexproindicator. VyNNeR

Thanks VyNNeR, Regards.

Looks like we have a new 4 hour cross on GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #656 ---
we have, i have not entered on this one as i see yesterday's high was smack on the top of this downward channel cable is in. i would rather leave my entry until i see it break yesterday's high, that way it's taken out the channel and will still meet the conditions for a long trade.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Agree, although my back testing shows that should not concern us, I am looking for an entirely mechanical system to trade see my back tests posts, all performed manually according to vynners paramaters post 552

--- 帖子 #658 ---
nice... that's compounded yes?! so looking at your post, you are ignoring stochs and literally entering just on the 4,13 crossing the 50? and exiting on a 13,4 cross? or have you made other changes?

--- 帖子 #659 ---
No other changes, stochs ignored I am live testing, so will keep updated although this was the first signal since May 2nd I see this as a very successful long term stategy

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Agreed. I am keeping an eye out on both GBP/USD and EUR/JPY for some diversity. I am still considering the Stochs though. Currently short on EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I've just entered this trade solely on the basis of the EMA crossover, ignoring stochastics (and RSI) which both indicated an overbought condition. So far so good as GBPUSD is trading sideways and optimistic of an upward move.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Dear all traders and frens, Lately i have found out that in order to filter bad trades for this system, one got to regconise the pattern of overall price actions. You can easily spot if the market is moving sideways, trending or reversal. Try to zoom out on a 4 hour chart and have a better view of the graph. For example we have seen cable moving in range for quite few days now. Once it break out of its range , we should be able to bank in some good pips. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #663 ---
To Author and Vynner I've tested this strategy. Here rules're in pseudo-code: Buy: ema4 &gt; ema13 &amp;&amp; ema13 &gt; ema50 &amp;&amp; stok &gt; stod Close Buy: ema4 &lt; ema13 Sell: ema4 &lt; ema13 &amp;&amp; ema13 &lt; ema50 &amp;&amp; stod &gt; stok Close Sell: ema4 &gt; ema13 In Buy and Sell last condition is a filter. So, H4, GBP, SL 50, TP 200, Jan 1 to May end 2007, with filter: http://yorsh2007.hotmail.ru/SWT-01-05-2007-GBP-FLT.gif So, H4, GBP, SL 50, TP 200, Jan 1 to May end 2007, without filter: http://yorsh2007.hotmail.ru/SWT-01-0...GBP-NONFLT.gif The best result was in March: http://yorsh2007.hotmail.ru/SWT-03-0...GBP-NONFLT.gif And the worst in May Maybe, I'm doing something wrong? F.E. conditions should be not-in-the-same-time??? It's easily to correct, if it's meaningful. Stochastic filter at D1.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
At first, I had great feeling about this strategy, not any more. If you look at a 4H chart, the entry is very very late most of the time, only we are lucky if the trend in very big. A better method should catch a trend at the first quarter or first half atleast, as 4H chart already leave lots of pips behind. If anyone happily see this strategy even in demo, please post your opinions. Vynner's other short term trading methods are according to his posts, some signal services . Of course you catch big pips (if you have the courage to stay that long with real money), and lose many times with stopping out, with this strategy. Waste of time. Please post any opinions on this, .

Hey yall... I've been putting Vynner's trading technique to use and have scored whenever I did trade. But, my personality is the type where I have to see profits come in on a daily basis; so I go for 10 pips daily. Truthfully, I have been able to double my account monthly. Four months ago, I blew my initial $300 startup account and it was at $100, then started using Vynner's technique and got it back up to $300 plus an additional $100 for $400 total in my account. But, I knew that my personality didn't allow me to see profits sporadically with so much waiting time in between. I have been using a daytrading technique, which I won't mention here because I don't want to pull peoples hopes up just to have them fall on there faces(hint: I only trade during european session), that allows me to get 10 pips per day. I have been using this certain technique daily and have never had a loss in the last 3 months with it. I have been doubling my account twice per month and I started with the $400. So, now my account is presently sitting at $25,000 this moment(I took out some money and went bought me a cheap labtop at Walmart). I'm not bragging, but am trying to tell people that certain techniques work for certain people. I have found one that works daily and I found that 10 pips is a no brainer in addition to know that with a 10 pip profit daily, I'm exposed to the market half the time I would be exposed to the market if I were going for 15 or 20 pips daily. The less time I spend in the market, the less time I will have of loosing money in my estimation. peace, hilton

currencytrader, Congrats on your success. Would you mind starting a new thread and posting the link gere, to explain your "european session 10 pips daytrading technique?" I am sure many would appreciate your kindness.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi all, Been lurking around the forums at FF for a while and love the admosphere, this is also my first post. I have read the Vynner trading system from post 1 to the end and if you look at all the back testing, and I have done back testing of my own, is that the system give's you an average of 150+ pips a month, if you take into account late exits which should have been executed earlier. Not bad at all if you consider the time span for a trade and what was mentioned earlier is that I am in for the long haul. The only way I see it is that you take what the market gives you so in this system if the 4 EMA and the 13 EMA cross you are out, correct me if i'm wrong, so I do not understand why Megapips would TP 200. I would just like to ad what was discussed in a previous post and I have back tested this with success is to trade 2 accounts, take 20 pips in the same direction for the one and to let the other trade run. Just my 2c Thanks for a great forum Schaune

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I have found that this method works well if you don't force any trades. Like any system, you'll have losing trades, but if you consider the big picture like VyNNeR suggests, you'll have success. Look at longer term trendwalls, fib retracements and extensions, etc. If you are trying to use this as your only trading style, you might have a hard time. This is only good for 2 or 3 trades a month, more or less, and it works as part of an overall trading regimen. I've tried to fine tune the entries using different methods, and had mixed results. That kind of defeats the purpose of this anyway, which as far as I can tell is to try and catch the trend and ride it up or down. This is actually a lot like a method I paid a lot of money to learn. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles and maybe produces fewer trades, but the concept is sound. Just scroll through the 4 hour charts once a day until you find one that looks close to crossing. Check to see that the daily stoch is moving in the same direction as the impending cross, and determine if you are close to any significant support or resistance. Figure out when you think the cross is going to occur, come back to the chart then, and if everything looks good, just get in. Remember, it's not how many winners or losers you have, it's how much you make at the end. You could lose 3 out of 4 of these and still wind up a couple of hundred pips ahead. Thanks VyNNeR for sharing this with us. Richard

Hey dude, I'm all ears and eyes...I'm currently paper trading a few short and medium term systems that I've acquired from these threads. I'd greatly appreciate if you could share your strategy with us so that I can see if it sits well with me too. cheers

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I shared your experience....got excited when I saw the entry...then watched as the price kept going (gradually) down, down, down.....until stopped out. Ok, life goes on....one trade is not enough to fully test this system...so let's look for another entry, then another, and another....

Thanks Mikelath, will look forward to more trades. .

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hey yall, I got 5 emails in my email box asking me how I trade the european session for 10 pips per day. There is one day a week where it doesn't work. But, instead of trading it and taking a loss on the chin, my system allows me to stay out. For all of you folks who keeps emailing me, here's what you need to do(and this is what I did to help myself); instead of asking for more and more systems to test and trade, what you need to do is look at all the systems that are posted on this whole board. Secondly, look at what is working and what is not working, then take out those things that actually work in the real world of trading. Since I like to trade the gbp/usd, I looked at all the systems that delt with the gbp/usd ONLY! I took out what worked in all the systems, then I created my own system and personalized it to my personality. So, even if I gave you my system, you would still not be able to trade it just like you're not able to satisfactorily trade the system(s) that you're trying to trade now. What you guys need to do is just look at what works for the currency pair that you want to trade and take those things out of every system that is posted on this board and then personalize what works for your personality. Here's an example: I trade the 5 minute chart for the gbp/usd because it fits my personality(Vynner's trading technique worked for me but didn't fit my personality so I dropped it). So, what I did was I went to every daytrading system on this board, thread by thread, and tested what actually worked in the real world of trading for months. When I saw my results I went with it. Once this testing period was done, I then went with the big boys and started using what actually worked to my benefit. And, in 3 months I brought up my $400 account to $25,000 by going for 10 pips per day 4 days a week and sometimes even 5 days per week. I always double my money twice per month; but sometimes, I'll get unlucky and only be able to double my money in a 3 week period and then make 50% more on that amount of money on the 4th week. Find something that works for who you are and then back test what works 4 out of 5 days during the week; even with big news on those days. It can be done, but only the top 5% knows about it. The battle is won, nearly 100% of the time when you understand you. And, nobody knows you better than yourself, which is why systems that work half the time for someone doesn't work the other half; because systems don't understand a person. I won't be online for a week because I'm moving to Honolulu, Hawaii from Missouri. I'll be back on line next week so if you guys want to post something, then by all means please do it.... peace,, h.m

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Thank you for your reply. Which are the 4 days you trade?

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Hi all, First of all thanks for currencytrader for his encouraging posts. Here is a nice 5min system which can produce 10 pips or more a day, and risk is very less. Actually I started to do demo on it and so far positive. . http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=22680

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Jeff, You ask me "what are the 4 days I trade"?... Well, to be frank and honest with you, it shouldn't make any difference. If a person is willing to trade the first 4 days of the week, then the 5th day is a no brainer. My concern is not what days are the best to trade, because in reality there are no best days. I let the market determine what the best days are. People who try to figure out what the best days are, are the very same people who place there assumptions above the reality of what the market does. And, as we all know, the reality of this game is that NO ASSUMPTIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON WHAT THE MARKET SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT DO. The reality is that the market will do what it wants to do and if you understand the way your personality allows you to trade, then the only other thing to figure out is what works and what doesn't work in the PRESENT moment; and not what should work in the next hour. As quagmire, the Jedi night, would say, "stay alert in the moment". And, although Star Wars is pulp fiction, there are some truths that apply even to fiction..... h.m

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Megapips, With a handle name like that if you're not making 10 pips a day, I'll have to leap across these high lines and "pimp slap" ya..hehe...just kidding. Seriously though, that was one of the threads that I looked at for the gbp/usd and found that it didn't fit my view of how I saw that market. But, what that thread did prove was that the market does make certain moves every day for the gbp/usd due to the volatility of that currency pair. What I did was took a certain viewpoint from that technique and combined it with several dozen other gbp/usd daytrading techniques and created a system that worked for both my personality and my eyes. h.m

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Thanks currencytrader for your reply, as you indicated, everyone's trading style should be different according to their knowledge, risk level and so many other factors. There cannot be any single system which fits all. Even big traders try to learn and search something new everyday. Thanks again.

I have been testing the Linear Regression Indicator, LRI at 13 setting, on the current system with good results, all other indicators remain in place. By adding the LRI you assure yourself of better entries and exit. The LRI, which I have used for years, was not available on MT4 but a charitable FF sole gave it to me and I will try to post it here (first experience tell me if it does not work). As mentionned, the setting should be 13. The LRI can be called a supercharged MA as it follows price action much more closely and indicates where price should be rather than averaging them, it is a predictive indicator. It works much like a Bol. band as the market crosses above or bollow the LRI. It can also be used as a signal line (ex: when it crosses a long term EMA as the 50 we are currently using). I am including the indicator with a chart (save and open with Paint) Meanwhile, I also include a definition of the LRI and some link for further study: Linear Regression Indicator The Linear Regression Indicator plots the trend of a security's price over time. That trend is determined by calculating a Linear Regression Trendline using the least squares method. This ensures the minimum distance between the data points and a Linear Regression Trendline. Unlike the straight Linear Regression Trendline, the Linear Regression indicator plots the ending values of multiple Linear Regression trendlines. Any point along the Linear Regression Indicator will be equal to the ending value of a Linear Regression Trendline, but the result looks more like a Moving Average. Unlike a Moving Average, the Linear Regression Indicator does not exhibit as much delay. As the Linear Regression Indicator is fitting a line to the data points rather than simply averaging them, the Linear Regression line becomes more responsive to changes in prices. The Linear Regression Indicator can be thought of as a forecast of the tomorrow's price plotted today. When prices are persistently higher or lower than the forecasted price, expect them to quickly return to more realistic levels. The Linear Regression Indicator shows where prices should be trading on a statistical basis and any excessive deviation from the regression line is likely to be short-lived. http://ta-glossary.netfirms.com/taglossary-L.htm NOTE: THE CURRENT LRI INDICATOR PROGRAM DOES NOT HOLD IT'S LINE TICKNESS SETTING, IF SOMEONE COULD CORRECT THIS, IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

the close above 1.9900 yesterday was a nice strong bullish bar and move. apart from the ol' round number psychology of 2.0000 i don't see any "major" resistance to around 2.0060's. i have moved my stop to b/even now that it's up 100 pips.... not the rules, but with that much of a move why risk a massive rejection and wipe out 50 pips... IMHO of course. hehe

Hi all, I would suggest that the gbp is in an upward trend, again, with new high highs and high lows, this should not worry us mechanical traders, at this point in time I do not see the EMA4 crossing EMA13. Yet I have banked all real dollar accounts and left but 1 lot for the crossing...more thanks and High Five to the Linear Regression Indicator from Tikin Tikin, I experimented and found that reading on the very end of the indicator most useful for the exit strategy on the AUDUSD after the release of data, thanks for the reference to the source (for the study material) and your contribution.... Kind Regards, mattfx

Bye the way, I would like to make a comment about TiKin's avitar, yet I am at a loss for words LOL mattfx

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hello MattFX, I am glad you like the LRI, I wanted to ask you on which time frame you used it on the AUD and at what setting. Concerning my Avatar, it also made me laught a lot when I first found it. As a matter of fact this made me think right away about my cousin's ex-wife who had already ruined 2 good husbands. Imagine this beautifull woman of 5'7'' slender with black hair and bleu eyes and with that ''je ne sais quoi'' that actually was that 20% American Indian blood in her. College professor, you see what I mean the whole work, but with a hidden side...... she loved old and very large houses, needed to be more than 100 years old (that is old in Canadian standards) and of course she wanted that house impeccable at all times inside and out. So her first husband, my cousin and best friend, who was also a professional had written chores for most of the evenings and ALL his weekend and that lasted for 5 years of happiness as his wife was so happy but only when he had somekind of a brush in his hand (paint, dust etc...) after 5 years he wanted his weekend to come with me fishing, hiking but to no avail, his wife would not ear of it and they finally split after 10 years. The beautifull gal now a Phd, got married a second time to another of my friend and I tried to warn him gently but you know how it goes she had him by the b.......... LOL. After only 4 years of painting, mowing, trimming, glazing he had it and pulled out of the trade, you might say he went to the right side of the LRI. So when I found this avatar and after drinkig a few beers on Friday night finding this quite funny, I decided to e-mail her and joined this avatar with the comment : Here is for you to show the world you have changed for the better.... post this proudly to your office door and scream to the world that you are no longer the woman you use to be................. she never answered but made my 2 buddies laught for hours. I have been using this avatar since as a reminder to my own wife that I will not submit to cruel and unusual punishment, to her amusement. Good week to you

From your experience, is it better to use the 4HR chart for LRI?

--- 帖子 #692 ---
As a general rule the signal seems more reliable on the 4Hr, but the greatest indicator is still your own mind and the true secret to success in Forex. I often meet with fellow traders from my area and one is very succesfull, asking him about his strategy he showed me his statement for six months, as I was looking at the many pages of trades, I notice that page after page there was not one lost trade, I mean not one (I probably have it laying around somewhere). I asked him in amazment: what are you doing. He said I don't like to brag, but since you ask me here it is. He was using the LRI as we pretty much all do but always traded in the direction of the trend and his secret was simple ''I stay in until I make money'', if the trend goes against me, I hedge using a corelated pair (we all trade at Oanda and we cannot hedge their directly). So he was often at -100 even 200 pips but stayed in until the market reversed to take it's long term direction, I was amazed. The following morning wich was a Friday of NFP, I decided to trade the news but made a bad mistake not listening to the indicators but to the news alone wich was extremly unfavarable to the USD as I was watching the USDCAD pair going up and up and up not following logic, when it hit a round number which was also a fibo retracement I went SELL thinking I had entered at a good price and it would reverse but it went -260 pips further up and I finally closed the trade with a 40 pips gain but 29 days later, I decided that it was not for me but it did work even if I made a foolish decision. He still trades that way and has made millions literally. It is not for everyone. Hower, his strong math background make him very comfortable, lucky I had him during this ordeal of the 29 days CAD experience as he assured me that the market would evantually come back, on my own I would of lost a lot of money on that trade. A good pair for that system is the EURGBP who can be in a 100-150 pips range for months. This method does not use any stops of course, only logical limits.

Hi all, Did anyone take this latest signal ?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
or did you miss it like i did while i was out?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Of course thanks to the LRI, entry at 1.9815, saw that the LRI was still pointing straight down, trailed stoped it and this morning at more than 100 pips, the market even broke the daily TL, couls go far.

You should use the free alert FX service and be paged on your cell phone, the best programmation here is EMA 4 cross EMA 50, as they don't offer the LRI. This way you don't have to be in front of the screen and you don't miss the boat. Good weekend to all

Excellent suggestion TiKin

--- 帖子 #699 ---
gft has price alerts to your email and sms... it has indicator alarms, but they don't have the email/sms option. fortunately, i missed it, but i don't mind. yes i am here, like everyone else to make money, but like you say mattfx, another trade is just around the corner. it "feels" to me like we are starting to see some definite movement in some currency pairs again.. being that most people's strats are "trending" friendly, good times may very well follow.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hello TiKin In my 4h gbp the Linreg line at end shows 1.9700. a little above says 1.9743.does it mean that if it reverses it may go to 1.9747? Your comment will be greatly appreciated. Senbanda

--- 帖子 #701 ---
The actual reading is 1.9676 on the LRI, make sure to be precise and put your cursor right on the tip on the indicator. This simply means that statistically the market should be at this level, the market is at 1.9646 which mean we are in a trending market as the actual price is lower than the stat. price. This mean that at some futur point these prices will avantually meet, finding an equilibrium and the the stat price will also become lower than the actual price showing a slow down of the trend and a possible reversal, as we saw a few days ago, when the market reversed. However, the angle of the LRI is still straight down and that announces more dropping of price. Note as well that the 1 H LRI is still holding.

The LRI 4h is still holding and we might see some further price drop, as it is now 30 degrees and sunny, I am closing 90% of my position at 1.9644 with a stop just above the daily trend line as the market should bounce on it to go back down, if not I am placing my stop at 1.9740, it is Friday after all. Thank you very much Veneer for your system and the genuine and positive effort of all here. A great thread. Good weeked to all

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi TiKin Can you pls tell me how do use this 4 hr strategy on oanda platform(3hr) and how do you set it up. I appreciate all your help. Thanks Tasse

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hello Tasse, I gather you are speaking about the present thread strategy developed by Vynner. If you want to use the original strategy it is easy to setup on Oanda. However, Oanda does not have the Linear regression indicator (the demand is not there and not many know about the power of this indicator, I learned it through my brother who is an Economist); I have asked for it for the past 5 years and even send them the formula and they told me they were looking into it.... that was about 2 years ago. So you will have to use MT4 which, in my oipinion, is a far better charting package. The only real advantage with Oanda is that it is, as far as I know, the only firm where the charts are 100% syncronised with the dealing station, which is good for scalping. I hope this answers your question, if not try again. Good weekend

Hi Tikin The LRI has turned in both EU and GU 4H charts. Do you think it is going to be long entries for both Thank you Senbanda

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Long entry when LRI crosses the 50, now time to flatten all. Furthermore the system in here is for the GBP. Dear Tasse, I am still not getting your second request and I think this thread is maybe to advance for you presently. You might want to go to beginners forum http://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=56 PLease read the Oanda platform user's guide on grapgh http://fxtrade.oanda.com/help/manual/ Best to you

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Many thanks for that Tikin. The alert services that Vynner suggested are www.forexproalerts.com and www.forexproindicator.com Thanks for alertfx.com I'll check it out. I'm finding that for a beginner like me these signal services help to take out most of the emotion associated with trading, at least until I'm proficient with a successful strategy.

hello all...i'm a newbie trader first of all..i would like to thanks to Vnnyer for his great gbp/usd system and the EA maker... i would like to ask... i just download this EA vnnyer swing v1.2.mq4 and the problem is... could some one explain to me...how to apply and use the EA.. because i still cant do it.. it's just doesnt work with my MT4 thanks

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi oei168, If I am not wrong, this is an indicator not an EA. Copy it in you Indicator folder and restart MT4. Apply it to your charts and you will see a green arrow to buy, a red arrow to sell and an X to go out of the trade. Hope this helps, Hani

--- 帖子 #717 ---
@hani.. thank u very much for your usefull information.. yes you are correct..... it's an indicator not an EA.. LOL

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Ok, we are very close to closing the trade on the crosses now with a cross forming at 1.9714, according to Vynner's conditions from the last signal short around 1.9786 area (although I closed my live account position on todays break above the 1.9690 area) and now incorporating Tikin's LNR indicator. I still see importance in allowing the cross to complete on the 4 hour candle for confirmation as the trend can continue and one may miss many more profits when closing early, this strategy requires profits to run to be successful, my objective is to "free up" computer time, I see this as a successful strategy long term and I will continue to record the results and post shortly Have a great day, mattfx

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I stand corrected, I closed demo account this time as I missed the last signal short, yet have set up alertsfx so that I will not miss the next signal, thx again tikin !

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Thar we go, we have a cross

--- 帖子 #721 ---
matt what cross i only see ema 4 cross ema 13?

--- 帖子 #722 ---
..yes, the 4/13 cross is a VyNNeR exit signal.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
i just want to make sure.. is realy VYnner suggest ... forexproalerts n forexproindicator.. ?? im just afraid that the signals / past perfomance is not honest... can some explain to me.. maybe vynner would like to explain .. thanks

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Dear all traders, Hope every benefit from those who contribute on this thread. Everyone caught some profit on the last signal that the swing system produce? You guys might want to try taking profit on different levels of S/R. Good Luck and Happy PiP-ing!! VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Dear oei168, Yes i did suggest forexproalerts and forexproindicator on the previous posts. These are the additional tools that i have been using for quite sometime now. I dont claim they are the best but im making some good profit with my swing trade + forexproalerts + forexproindicator. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #726 ---
thank you very much..... i think i will try..your suggest

--- 帖子 #727 ---
The forexproindicator works ok, especially if you filter it for overall direction. It creates a channel based on the (normally) most recent swing high and low before 0700 UK time and entering the channel break with a trailing stop-loss. You can work this out yourself from their results charts. All the fancy moving averages are just camouflage. Tooloud

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Dear tooloud, Those Moving Average is very important. I use them for bigger pips gain for exit strategy. Trailing stops only helps me when im not infront of my computer. And its certainly worth it as i get my updated version 5 times now from the day i got the indicator. Hope that helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Fair enough Vynner. I use Stochs and RSI to get out. It is not an expensive purchase and certainly not a scam so I accept your point. Just not a great moving average fan. Best regards, Tooloud

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi TiKin Thanks for the reply. What I mean is that oanda have 3hrs TF rather rhen 4 and since this strategy is for 4hrs TF, do you actually change any parameters for any of the indicators or just use it exactly as described by vynner in the first post. many thanks Tasse

--- 帖子 #731 ---
You could try it on the Oanda 3H with the original setting. However, if you want to use the LRI under a Java based platform you could try http://www.netdania.com/ChartStation.asp Clic on try demo now and then learn to use it with the help file. All workspace can be saved for later use and it is free.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
hello everyone, i am trying to set up vynner's trading strategy on my system,can anyone please tell me how/where to get it,and the steps to follow,thanks

--- 帖子 #733 ---
...the details can be found in VyNNeR's first post to this thread. Just set the moving averages and slow stochastics up on your charting software and away you go - demo trade for a while first!

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hello Traders and hopefully programmers, I reiterate my demand that someone that knows a little programming fixes-up the Linear Regression Indicator programming. The line width setting does not hold if I change time frame or if I pass from one profile to another. Would be great if this little problem could be fixed so that the line acts like all the others. Right now it always comes back to the thin line as default. Thank you so much

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Tikin, All you need to do is go into navigator, right click linreg and modify, then change the line width from 1 to 2 and the DRAW_LINE figure from 1 to 2 (or whatever width you want), then click compile and then close the editor.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Dear Scorpion, thank you and I will try that, if I don't succeed, I will write to you so you can do it. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #737 ---
thanks chow clown,will work on it

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi Tikin Thanks for your help and advice. Why dont we all oanda user make a request for the LRI with oanda. Did you just used live help to make this request 5 years ago or did you do it some other way. what do you think of the idea? Regards tasse

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Made request by phone, helpdesk, letter and even spoke with Dr. Stump regarding other matters but I mentionned about that, many request over several years but the last one is 2 years ago. GOOD LUCK but I am done; they have mentionned that they receive something like 100 or 200 demands daily on charts indicators, suggestions etc...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hello everybody, I am trying this system and would like to ask who uses it for long time - are we seeing the signal right now on the GBP/USD 4h chart? But on D chart stoch doesn't show the valid buy signal am I correct? Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
There were many successful trades which were not according the daily stoch. So, I take this as a valid entry.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Dear MegaPips, I usually do not want to go against the bigger trend. I'll stay out on this one. Anyone i have made +31 pips on cable today with my other tools. So i wont be chasing price.. Those who take this trade.. All the best and good luck VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Dear Vynner, are you here? did you just long for a signal about half an hour ago? I did. I use your method.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Sorry Vynner, I didn't read your previous message. so you didn't entry long. why? against bigger trend? what is or how is to define bigger trend?

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi all, I don't have a confirmed cross of the 13 ema and 50 ema on my four hour chart just yet... I also see the daily stochs as still favourable with no confirming reversal cross on the four hour stocks, with this in mind and my past analysis of this sytem I am prepared for the next entry should it occur. I can still see a move on my other fib indicators to 1.9880 area. Although I took a trade earlier using the linreg indicator providing an entry just above the 1.9780 break of past high Ok, lets see what pans out for now mattfx

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi there, I paid good money for another forex course which is so "noisy" (with all the indicators etc) and complicated that I am too confused to trade. I read about your swing method and it all makes prefect sense and 4 hour trading suits me very well considering I work full day plus have a small child / husband so I really don't have time to watch the graphs like a hawk. I want to say thank you as it is working quite well (I am demo trading until I am 100% confident with this system). Just a question about the MVA's - I am confused as to why you wait until the 50 MVA has been crossed to go in for trade? I have found that as soon as the 13 &amp; 4 MVAs have crossed then you are 80% sure to make a great trade. Plus the stochs are running faster than the MVAs so they already give you a heads up as to what is coming. The GBPUSD from Friday is a perfect example of what I mean - the MVAs (13 &amp; 4) crossed only after the major announcements but the stochs had crossed earlier (for a buy) and the trade is still running- a very nice 80pips + trade there...It is almost too easy but it really is working for me. Just please advise on the 50MVA cross you spoke of? Regards, Smarti

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hi again, Here is the past analysis (all performed manualy) of the last 109 trades for this system. These have been performed with no regard to the stochs, trade 104 to 109 have been performed in "live" conditions I think this system should suit the long term swing trader, although max draw down is 27.24 % at trade 64, but if you look at the attachment you will see a draw down of 26.75 at trade number 7, 26.48 at trade at 108, so we are yet to see draw down of over 30%? Good luck all mattfx

--- 帖子 #748 ---
hi Vyneer, do u think it would be ok to use a 20pip SL,and have u tested on gbp/gpy pair,any recomended hours to trade, thanks

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Thanks VyNNeR for your comment. I came out with +16 pis already, as you say, this is a trade against bigger trend. cheers.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Smarti, These results have been calculated after confirming the cross of 13 ema / 50 ema and then enter at the open of the next four hour candle. So it is according to the rules, correct me if I am wrong, the cross is confirmed by the closing of the four hour candle. We need a closed candle to confirm this cross and then enter on the open of a new four hour candle. This is how I have interpreted the rules of this system and provided analysis in my previous post. I used JoshDancers expert indicator to assist for the past analysis. I have disregarded the stochs, for the purpose of the analysis, I have also examined how each trade would be if let go to the max stop of 50 pips, the results basically cut the return by about 50%, so not bad for a purely mechanical system, which is, as you appear similarly looking for, a system that frees up computer time ? good trading mattfx

--- 帖子 #751 ---
The LRI cross occured last night (NYT) at 1.9774 and went all the way to almost 70 pips gain. The only thing that bothers me a little is that the market bounced at the 61.8% fibo level of this upward move, hopefully it will exceed that and hit the daily trend line / Resistance at 1.9900. Thanks again to Vynner and all

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Hi all, I have an entry signal for a long trade at 1.9820

--- 帖子 #753 ---
TiKin, Please leave out the "braggato" such as fith winner in a row, this market has no room for ego or any other emotion. Like most traders just can't handle pullbacks and cut profits too short, this system requires holding on to winners over a longer time frame than a few hours, I would also like you to post the "fifth" consecitive loss loss in a row that you have experienced, because, as you know, it does happen, yet I feel people will be mislead by such comments as "fifth" winner in a row, and I see them as gamblers and not willing to admit losses, which every trader knows is apart of the forex game, all I am seeking is a system that takes away the emotional part and just leaves us with a profitable mechanical system to trade in the long term, maybe this is it, I don't know. If you think I am brash, you are probably right mattfx

--- 帖子 #754 ---
You are right, a little to emotionally involved.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
TiKin, will you please explain how you are using LRI indicator to predict price levels, with some charts? I am still not clear about LRI . Thanks.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
SEE post 686 and 701 as an example, if that does not answer your question, please feel free to ask again, I will do my best. At 9:40 NYT, the market is on the buy side of the LRI (left side) and it is still pointing North which is bullish with no apparent signs of weakness, the stat price is at 1.9812.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Thanks, will try to learn more about it's use.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
MT4 is in Central Europe time and for many that might be confusing, espacially to know when a candle will close, when it open etc... This free tool is an international easy to set clock that might help some people (needs registration). http://www.ntp-systems.com/symmtime.asp I have set an MT4 time and it helps for entry.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hello Vynner Thanks for post your system, that I think is very interesting and I´m going to test in a demo account. I red your strategie, and now looking at Eur/Usd chart I see a signal for de ema cross right now, so, for what i understand it´s to open long next candle isn´t it? But my stoch (13,5,5) are in a overbought area (92.1723) and near k% cross D. What i must consider? Cross Emas or cross Stochs. So, are two contradictors signal. Can you see please? Sorry I don´t know how to atached the Chart . I tried, but........... Sorry for my bad english Thanks for your atenttion

--- 帖子 #760 ---
...price now taking a breather on the LRI sell side (right side)... FXCM 's ChartStation LRI figure currently printing 1.9836. Does look like a bull flag (or similar) on the 4hr, so my money's still long.... Using the LRI slope change looks useful for getting in earlier on a trend change, before the LRI/50ema cross - will be interesting to test both variants.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
The market has travelled to the right side of LRI what counts the most is when full candles close on the right side of the LRI and more dramatic is when the LRI stars changing direction, which is not the case for now and the LRI still points North. OK Chow, this is important, I have checked another chart package (Net Dania, same as FXCM ) and the hours are local, which means that if I am in Canada and you in Asia, we will get different readings of the LRI. Right now, a 4H candle has closed on the sell side of the LRI on Net Dania but not on MT4 and that tells me that what at first seems a drawback of MT4 with it's fixed hours, does actually seems to be a better setup as we all have the same reading no matter our geopraphical location

Dear all traders, Anyone still taking the long on the previous signal? All i see that there is not much Resistance in the way for the upmove now. If you guys are already in the trade, just take care of your profits. For those who is not in yet, please do not chase price. Just my 2 cents. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #765 ---
so,do you mean, the price will go down again ?? and what do you mean, there isn't much resistant ?? so the price will shoot up or..tend to go to support area ?? thanks.. im sory ..im a little bit confused

--- 帖子 #766 ---
hi tikin, how do you confirm that the LRI is on the left side or the right side, i already see your pic attach, but it does not make clear on me.. if im not wrong, what i see in the chart with the LRI and Vnnyer system.. it,s look like the GBP/usd will go down , so the peak is at 1.9855 -- and tend to go down, because the candle now is on the right side of LRI ..is that right ?? thanks.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Dear oei168, Not much Resistance on the upside means, cable has not much area of concern on the upside. My bias is up, but of cos market can do anything. I also just received a long signal from forexproalerts, tight stop and risk reward ratio is good for the upward too. I would think the trend is up now and i would also prefer to trade with the trend and never trade against the trend. Trend is our fren. It might retrace but its still upward bias. Hope this helps VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Clear BOS

--- 帖子 #769 ---
VyNNeR, Yesterday, on post 742, you were telling that you may stay out of this trade as daily stoch is not in favour and you wouldn't go against the bigger trend - meaning trend was down. But now you are indicating that in your view, trend is up (post 767). Could you please clarify this? Which timeframe you take as the bigger trend? If you think the trend is up now, when did this occur? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Dear MegaPips, This swing setup strategy is what we call a system. Systems will generate profits for us in the long run as long as we are consistent and persistent. But we must also know that in FOREX market changes their sentiment with only a few candles despite what time frame you use. Generally i look at daily, 4hours, 1hour and 15 mins to get the general directions. Anyway i did stick with my system and i did stay out of this previous long signal but im still trading other tools to get some intraday pips. The reason i comment on the trend is up because i did see some of you guys actually trade that long signal despite its against my filter on this swing trade. Nothing wrong with it. Remember the first post on this thread is just a basic setup. On a lot of cases, i do also take profit out of the table before the MAs recross again. I do not want to confuse ppl who wants to follow this system. As time goes by, you will understand more on strong Resistance and Support and therefore you can gain more pips with taking profits along the way. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #771 ---
i think the signal from your sytem ..is telling us to go LONG, right ?? ema 4 and 13-cross the EMA 50 and the daily stoch--want to go up

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Thanks VyNNeR.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Price has now been on the sell side of LRI for 20+hrs and the LRI is now beginning to flat line/reverse slope, but isn't confirmed yet (end of current 4hr candle with FXCM's ChartStation is 13:00 BST). 1.9835 holding as support for the last 8 hours, so my profits are locked in around that level for now. We should perhaps start a new thread for the LRI, rather than cluttering this one.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
hi VYnner, just set up the system on my MT4,wanted to know if there are any recommendations for trading times,and any chance of explaining the stochs,i am having issues setting it up. thanks yeah also can i use 20 SL

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Good observation ChoW Chow, let's wait and see what the German ZEW will do in 5 minutes

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Dear all I took only about 10 pips profit from the long. And currently im short on GU from 19835. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Chow, When you mention that the LRI is forecasting higher prices, it would be more exact to say that the stat price should be 9865 but the direction of the LRI is also important, it has now tendency to flatten, also observed on 4h majors as well. Equilibrium will finally take over when LRI and market price are at 0 level or the same, but as a general rule it is a good idea to take profit when you observe the market migrating to the right with several candles as observed and just keep on a smaller position. One can always get back in the market later in the day. One observation that has been true for years is that the market is always more directional once all the news have been digested by the market. The LRI is only a small optional tool to this great system but the other indicators (4-13) are still essantiel.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hi mattfx, thanks for these numbers and for running the backtest. Do you think that if you had used the stochastics in the daily as filter for the trades, your losing trades would have been less? Just wondering...

--- 帖子 #779 ---
A very difficult day to trade on cable .. Close my short for a small lost -5 pips .. Hope you guys do better than me. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #780 ---
This may sound really stupid but what is LRI? can someone help?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
How were you short? As to your system its a long on GBP/USD?

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hi all Yesterday according to a system I got the signal to go long which I did; I just closed the position cause got scared for the upcoming news, but I got +45 pips which I think is great. Dear VyNNer, Did I do something wrong cause you said you went short? Where you watching the other indicators? Cause the signal still is for long. Thank you

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Sorry guys .. i think i confused you guys on the short . It is another trade not based on my swing setup. Just ignore my short there. Hope you guys are protecting some of your long profits. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #784 ---
long? short? long? mixed day today.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Tikin introduced the Linear Regression Indicator to the thread, as an add-on to VyNNeR's method. See post 686 and 701.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
LRI .. how to determined when to exit ?? i still cannot get it..

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi, Read this attached document to understand about LRI, hope it will be useful.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi all, since last signal the system still is showing to go long, no signs on exit. Am I right? Today after news opened the position at 1.9900 and just closed at 1.9933. I do not like that I am entering and then closing positions maybe to early? Maybe anyone could explain how to get the right signal on exiting? Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi, My entry signal was 1.9820, there is no exit signal until the EMA4 crosses the EMA13 which has not occured, remember this system is long term and the best profits are achieved with patience, the move from the signal is now over 100 pips. Hope you're all still hanging in there ? mattfx

--- 帖子 #790 ---
I am long since the 18th. +95 pips.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Thanks for explaining - yes I have some problems with patience but will try to do better

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi again, The problem is that when you kill the trade too early you may miss out on a "big" move. This system depends on staying with the trade until you see the exit signal. I have proved the profitability of this system with over 100 back trades all meticulously analysed manualy according to the rules of this strategy and recorded in my previous posts, and guess what ? It works and can make millionaires of any one of us. This system depends on these "big" moves "big" moves = "big" profits. You must decide whether you are a "day" trader, (short term) or in for the "long" term using a strategy such as this. Like most strategies it is never conquered in a day. Have a great Day ! mattfx

--- 帖子 #793 ---
i think LRI .. isn't working to this case.. GU its give you the false exit.. 19865 .. and in fact the ema 13 and 4 ..not yet cross.. and still shoot up to 1.9--

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Thanks for posting your analysis. I am about to post the same analysis using FXCM 's tic data. Where is your test data from? I think it will be interesting to note the differences. Please could you let me know if your rules differ to what follows. This is the logic for LONGs only, i'll also be testing the short side: This assumes that 4ema will already have crossed the 50ema by the time the 13ema crosses the 50ema. Not tested with stochastics.

hmm breakeven across long and short trades. Nothing like the results Mattfx kindly posted....does anyone else have poor test results over the same period?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
CHowClown, did you filter your entries using the stochs in the daily? Ohhh..... sorry. I didn't read your note in your post in which you already answer this question. My bad!!!! Maybe the stochs filter is necessary to avoid the bad trades. I have not tested it, but it is there for a reason....I'd say

--- 帖子 #797 ---
No, i wanted to try and replicate the test results mattfx provided. He didn't use stochs either.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
...no worries. Maybe but Matt's results (without the stochs) were very encouraging!

--- 帖子 #799 ---
...2001 - 2007 backtest attached. Not something I could trade mechanically as it stands (through FXCM). Perhaps the real strength of the method is down to discretionary input around the entry/exit signals, as VyNNeR has suggested in previous posts, around key areas of support/resistance. Hopefully someone else will provide a backtest using other spot tic data (the results attached include slippage and a 5 pip spread). Perhaps the data i've been supplied with is inaccurate?! I wish it was, i like the method and was very surprised to see results so much at odds with Mattfx's testing. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Hello all, I think we are now touching on one of the most difficult subjects when trading, and that is, the exit strategy, yet this should not concern us, this strategy provides excellent entry and exit signals for those wishing to be "mechanical" traders, which is my objective. However the "chimp" brain and the "descendants" of chimps are not geared up to trading the forex. Which is not surprising, imagine that ! So as a fellow "chimp" with a "chimp" brain I am also challenging every trade I take ! How do we deal with this ? We must find a strategy that does not rely on the way our brains have evolved, lets face it, our brains are not geared for trading the forex and this is what we need to deal with. Good Luck all mattfx

--- 帖子 #801 ---
hmm, but if i'd traded the strat mechanically through FXCM over the last 6 years (using the criteria you used in your test, from what i've read in your posts), i'd be down 1300 odd pips...which broker/data are you using for your current live trading/testing of the strategy?

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Hi Chow, So you are saying that you have manualy examined every trade over the last six years for entry and exit signals according to the rules established by Vynner and using the data as provide from FXCM ? Or have you just run MT4 "strategy tester" to establish your results, I have also performed the very same tests using strategy tester and have found similar results, like yours. I would not rely on strategy tester. I have performed many a test using this very same functionality on this very strategy, and discovered that strategy tester is basicaly worthless and that analysis of past results need manual confirmation regardless of the data provider. Do I see a hint that you may want to blame the broker for bad data because strategy tester gave bad numbers ? Please clarify...

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Hi Matt, I do not use MT4. The backtest results were performed using hivetrader.com which enables testing of strategies using FXCM's tic data from 2001 to present. Interested to note your MT4 results were similar. I am hoping my manual forward testing of the strat will be in line with your own results, just can't fathom the deviation in performance of the backtest at the moment....hence my posting for more tic level testing from other data sources.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
As one said before about true results ''yet I feel people will be mislead by such comments'' while promissing all that follow will be millionaires Hummmm,LOL but no hard feeling . Back to earth please, the basic is that this system is excellent but I feel the entry and exit can be improved. The LRI entry shows this clearly for now, as it put you in the market 40-60 pips earlier than the EMA13. As far as exit, it is not perfect but gave me profit in the last 5 trades as the recross 4-13 eats most of the profit on shorter moves. The LRI remains, in my opinion, better to exit but it is a little hard to interpret, I admit; however, the present move is unusually strong and it is not often that we see a cross down LRI and cross up again, could it repeats itself a second time on that move ? LRI is still a very good indicator and it was possible to re-enter the trade using the 1H chart when the market jumped above the LRI yesterday morning. I would like to point out that the inventor of the system also suggests to cash-in some profit along the way, which in the long term will be excellent. I have also been experimenting with another exit signal that seems promissing (see attached chart). I am simply trying to contribute positively to this thread and all this ''stuff'' is stricly optional from the original Vyneer, so if you don't like it just ...

Chow, I will continue to record forward testing results as the signals present according to this strategy and provide posts. There is no substitute for the human eye, in analysis, I personaly have no faith in any computer system whatsoever, offered by a remote server of which I have no control over when it comes to past analysis. In the real world there is no substitute for the human eye in performing past analysis. Lets continue with our analysis in real time, agreed. mattfx

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Interesting idea, TiKin. I have a thought on using the LRI for exits, based on an 'on close' step down of the LRI, which often indicates a change in trend. The chart shows two instances of LRI step down, during the current trade. As you say, the strength of this move has been strong and during weaker moves, trailing profits under/above the candle that generated the LRI step up/down might be a more timely exit than waiting for the 4ema to cross the 13ema.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
That would be much appreciated, mattfx. I will record the automated version of the system i'm using, as a comparison.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Dear Chow, Your back test using FXCM is not valid and I have only notice one thing : Signal Activates: When EMA13 crosses EMA50 This is not the signal as you need to wait for the next open candle to open your trade. No offense to you but FXCM is one of the worst broker out there, traded there for one year and their tools are not sophisticated enough to trust. Secondly FXCM manipulates prices at will and as soon as you see slighly volatile prices happening, the discrepency between the price of their charts (any FXCM data fed charts) and their station can be 10-40 pips difference in their favor always, contrary to Oanda for instance which is the only broker I know where the live charts and station are 100% syncro. FXCM has also received several judgments against them from gov authority. I have also contacted US market authority about this and they candidly told me that there was no legal requirements to have charts and trading prices match, so most brokers take full advantage of that. The requirement is that the station price is the price you get under normal conditions. I think Matt back test is more precise. Please don't take offense at this post but just want to set the records properly.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Hi TiKin, no offense taken at all. We're all working towards the same goal. For your information and accuracy, execution of the 13x50 signal with hivetrader is at the open of the next bar, not as the 13 crosses the 50, so the entry is valid. I take your point about FXCM synchronicity, they are now forcing the No Dealing Desk on hivetrader members, which i'm not in favour of. I have traded with FXCM and Oanda for some time and have ceased trading certain strats with Oanda because of their variable spreads ...onwards and upwards

--- 帖子 #810 ---
OK but that is not what the code you posted said, I guess it was not complete. Backtest are usually not that relevant to real life as a general rule, I think. Thank you for your time and efforts.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Time will tell, TiKin. I sincerely hope my testing is proved wrong and the method is as successful as mattfx's testing suggests.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
UNBILIEVABLE that GBP it is still going up. I have been out for a while as the original method followers are making the big buck , well win some loose some as they say. Good for ya

Me also had a firm believe yesterday was the point of turn for cable, but it is proving that market is unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Dear all, What a great trading day today. I caught +30 +27 on cable and +40 on eur +10 on usd/jpy. Few days before this was a though day since it was ranging. Hope some of you guys are enjoying your ride on thie swing trade too but always remember to protect your profits. Always defining how much more are you going to risk for certain reward. I guess those who are patient enough will grab some pips. Part of FOREX. I have been asked a few times on private messages where do i take my profit as the market go a long for my swing trade. You guys might want to look at weekly pivots or even daily pivots for potential Resistance and Support. Pivots really rules in FOREX if you know how it works .. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #815 ---
oh no I can't belive how G/U turn. Very very unpredictable but still with in the method. If only I could HOLD ON !!!

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hi all. I just wanted to contribute here by emphasising that to maximise profits using this system, we're better off just letting the profits run and taking profits only at the open of a new candle AFTER the crossing of the 4EMA and 13EMA. In the current trade I caught the entry a little late though still did well even though I used 2 profit targets: Entry: 1.9843 P1: 1.9872 = 29pips P2: 1.9920 = 77pips Current Price: 1.9984 That's another 64pips to date had I held on without setting profit targets. Simply following Vynner's criteria will have much better results ( I'm drumming this into myself) as we see the current trade potentially meeting the take profits level as the 4EMA is getting very close to the 13EMA. REMEMBER, close the position only AFTER the cross and open of new 4hr candle. SIMPLE and SUBLIME ! rgs mike

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Congratulation on your trade, but Vyneer also mentions to cash in profit along the way just as you did. The present move is somewhat unusual where the original 4-13 cross and recross (not yet happened) worked well but that was not the case for the past 4-5 trades where most or all the profit was eaten away at the recross; that seems to be the case of many other trades where the movement are not deep and pronounced. That is why I still think that the present system is simple and good but can be improved to cash in profit for most trades even the short ones. I have proposed the Linear regression and the 20-21 EMA 1H but it would also be nice to have other input to tweak this system to near perfection (I hope this does not offend Vyneer as it is meant in good faith) . By the way, I want to point out that the recross upward of the EMA4 and the LRI13 was a very strong bullish signal (22-06 8:00)

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Current position +160 pips from signal 1.9820 to 1.9980 with no exit signal

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Remember to move Stop Loss for max loss at 50 pips, stop now now moved to 1.9930

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Hi mattfx, when during a trade do you begin trailing by 50?

--- 帖子 #821 ---
...so from this post i'm assuming you have now tweaked the exit method (from just 4/13 crosses), to include the trailing 50 stoploss, but that your manual backtest was based purely on the 4/13 cross....just wanting to be clear on what has been/is being tested.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hi all, I have just read my last post and realised that this strategy has no exit strategy other than "exit at the EMA4 cross with the 13EMA cross at the opening of a new 4 hour candle" yet I have trailed a 50 pip stop from the entry signal with great success, and hence the interjection with my my last post as we approach another potential cross on the indicators. However now that we are approaching "crunch time" cross immanent (or not?) we need to prepare for the exit. The most remarkable observation is that we need to check EACH AND EVERY 4 HOUR candle for this cross and be prepared accordingly to exit, unfortunately the signal may occur while we are not at our computers, asleep, on holidays, having sex, drunk or whatever. These variables have not been allowed for on my back test. Perhaps an EA on this strategy would be welcome. mattfx

--- 帖子 #823 ---
...ok, so how have you trailed - using increments of pips? or trailing best net pips by 50 from entry?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi Chow, My back test has been performed only with hindsight and a maximum stop of 50 pips from the cross of the EMA4 and EMA13, due to the "human" factors mentioned before, I have trailed a 50 pip stop since the entry signal on real account. I have not "tweaked" past results yet I have also recorded this very same trading system with max 100 pip limit and basically abandoned that as it was less profitable. mattfx

--- 帖子 #825 ---
OK, thanks matt.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
...the 4xLRI looking promising again, TiKin. Crossing, not crossed...yet. Could well be a pop and drop.

ok, thanks for that Tikin.

Hi again all. Does anybody know which other currency pairs this system works well with ? mike

--- 帖子 #829 ---
...just had the 4x13 exit on FXCM 's ChartStation, with a new 4hr period opening at 1.9944 at 9am (BST). A decent +120 trade from the 18th June entry.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi all, We have an exit signal around 1.9946 WE HAVE AN EXIT SIGNAL according to my data, which is "at the open of the next four hour candle post EMA4 and cross of EMA13", The "no brainer system", also works well on bar chart's, and most other vendor provided systems Comments appreciated, mattfx

--- 帖子 #831 ---
...out of interest, matt, what charting do you use? Cheers Chow

--- 帖子 #832 ---
FXCM printed 9927 bid earlier in the UK session...what was your low?...i take it your 9930 stop wasn't hit.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
In my opinion, as we are trading on a 4H chart, no need to exit as soon as we see the exit signal within minutes- not that hurry. If you see previous events and this trade as well, after the signal (cross)appeared, now the price is up again by several considerable pips. So, I think exit can be made in the 4 hour period or so. Please advise me if I am wrong.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
So, it supports what I suggested in previous post. As soon as the exit signat appears, no need to exit within minutes. Better wait till end of candle or put tighten the trailing stop. The next 4H candle may be in our favour again. This applies to entry as well - no hurry to enter. Now the price is over 120 pips in our direction, as the exit signal is not a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I know this is a dumb question, but I don't understand the entry. How do you know to buy or sell on the entry indication? Thanks to anyone who can help a slow member understand.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Post number 1 tells you everything you need to know about the basic concept. As a newbie, you should start there. T4K

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I appreciate you taking the time to reply, but I've read post #1 and understand the concept except for how do you know whether your entry is a buy or sell? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi, From post #1 "..Look at 4 hours chart Entry: When the EMA4 first cross the EMA50 follow by EMA13 cross the EMA50, with a new open candle, place your entry with a stop loss of 50pips. Exit : When EMA4 reverse and cross the EMA13 on the next open candle." ..to be completely clear: If EMAs cross upwards (as per post #1) then BUY. If EMAs cross downwards (as per post #1) then SELL.

Thanks, the slow one understands now.

Dear all traders, Someone actually wrote an EA for my other system on USD/JPY strategy. You guys can check it out if you want at http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=16242 Anyway so anyone tried to forward test this swing trade setup for other pairs on demo yet? Looks like there was a good trade of USD/JPY with this swing. Please do post your results if you have done so on other pairs here. Thanks. VyNNeR

Hello everybody, We might get the signal on GBP/USD? For a long time there was no signal and now on my charts I see MA(4) approaching MA(50). The signal for short entry I got on EUR/USD yesterday, but I think the system works better with GBP/USD??? Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I think it is not yet. Although the Daily Stoch seems heading down, I preferred to wait until the other two MA cross the 50. More safe, I think. Here is my chart. The magenta one is Linreg, others are MA.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
HI all, Thank's for sharing this one Vynner....it looks great to me. I'm a newby to Vynners method but having done some some research and back testing, though I am also a fan of forward testing.....I really like the possibilities of this one for more one than one reason but mainly because I won't have to be glued to the screen watching for every tiny change in the market. Walking away and not watching also appeals. Like everyone who is eagerly waiting for the first official trade in a while I think it won't be long in coming now. Have also been taking a trade each time the 4 crossed over the 13 (with the next open) while the 50 Ema was supporting the 4 and the 13 Ema's recently. The last run was a good one...I also only trade if the 26 Ema on the day chart is going in the same direction and there has been no divergences on the Day or the 4 hour to indicate a possible change in direction. just sharing.....and thanks again Vynner for a great system. Happy pipping to all Happy.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hi dzeba, I agree...the research I have done would also indicate that the GBP/USD is the best currency to trade with Vynner's system. I believe Vynner thinks so too. Good luck Happy.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi all, The 13 Ema just crossed over on my 4 hour GBP/USD chart at 2.0371 but I think it'll go up a bit before it continues. The new candle is my 8am which I believe makes it 9am in the UK......any thoughts anyone? Happy...

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Hi jancyryu I have back tested other currencies but have found that the GBP/USD works best....I also think that we have a good one in the making right now. The week is turning down as is the day.....it's looks it's all downhill except for the hour charts which will I expect reverse for a short while to catch it's breath.

Took a while, but finally the 4 and 13 EMA's crossed the 50EMA.. I end the day with +235 pips running..oh man this is awesome.. does anyone else here are "having fun with this system"? Oh for ppl who are having doubts about tryin' another currencies pair.. ive used this method on AUD/USD, im not really sure if its does work as work with GBP/USD, but as far as i tried i didnt get any false alert yet. Oh and if someone here tried this system with EUR/GBP I would like to know if you had any good trade..

--- 帖子 #849 ---
would you mind tell us what currencies pair did you try? and records if it possible? For GBP/USD this week was the only signal i got during whole month.. but its looking this only signal can recovery the monthly expectation. Like i mentioned before i used this on aud/usd (bought at 0.8466 and sold at 0.8818) and this week i bought at 0.8786 and still running following my gbp/usd signal.. im also planning to run this on eur/gbp pair. A friend of my used this system in another pair which he will tell me later and saying its give more trade opportunities than gbp/usd, when i get it and test it i will let you all know what pair he is using.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
does it still profitable strategy???

--- 帖子 #851 ---
can't tell you much.. gbp/usd took a while to give signal... but all the trade i had so far was profitable

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Ok people, we now have a long setup occuring on GBPUSD. The 13EMA has crossed the 50EMA and I'm now waiting for the open of the next 4hr candle before entering. This is happening during the asian market period, so for those still awake, you can get into this trade in about 30min as I type. The daily stochastic filter has turned from being overbought and is now up, thus confirming entry, and showing a positive indication of a good move up over the current week or two. Therefore, all the criteria for entry have been met, so fingers crossed for achieving some good pips !

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Where is Vynner? Can he mention what broker he use to set up this trade. Cos I got different view from different broker. I've seen many times in this site, good system based on Daily or 4 hour time frame will be defined as bad system because some people using different brokers than the system owner, so they look on different things. Here is the example : On Interbankfx chart (GMT+0), the stochastic has shown Buy Trend

--- 帖子 #854 ---
But......see this one which came from Alpari Rusia : The stochastic show the Long Setup but it is still in process, confirmation that it cross up will be done tomorrow on 00:00. Until the stochastic confirm on the closing of current daily candle, I think we may not assume that it will cross up. Any suggest from Vynner, what broker should we use together so we can see the same assumption? The Alpari Rusia chart time is based on GMT +2 (I guess). I am using MT_STOCHASTIC_V2 (Spudfyre's) to show the daily stoch, so it can show exactly the stoch line which is still in process, and the line which is already confirmed. See the different colors at the end of stoch line. That is the line which being developed by the movement of the candle in the whole day.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Hi mbah_sangil, VyNNeR is here i use GFT DealBook 360 to setup these charts. i believe there is a difference for different broker when they close their candles. Remember the Daily Stochs are just filters. Im trying to figure out a way for re-entries to give us more potential setups in a month. Will post suggested re-entries rules soon. Be patience guys. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #856 ---
VyNNeR and all try this stoch setting for your 4hr chart 30.10.10 let us know what you think?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Hi Vynner, thanks to reply. Yes, different brokers will give different result. And yes, The daily is the filter, but if we have different filters, then I believe we will have different result too. He.he.he. Now my question, what is the offset time from GMT that GFT Deal Book use for their chart? Is the demo version can work more than 30 days? Thank you Vynner to share the method. Best Regards, Sangkil

--- 帖子 #858 ---
VyNNer. For the benefit of all onlookers please share your experience on the following matter: You've mentioned that you sometimes take profits at support and resistance levels. Do you use the high, low and close of the previous week to calculate these levels ? Or, do you find that the crossing of the 4 and 13 EMA usually occurs at S/R levels anyway ?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Just a couple of observations...imo taking support and resistance into account on both entries and exits will help lower the risk and increase the probability of winning VyNNeR trades. What we see now (on GBP/USD) is a good example. The 4x13x50 entry was signalled, but this was before the resistance area (of the last week or so) had been tested. The current momentum of the test now underway, might even be enough to swing the EMAs to generate a short cross...who knows. As an aside, using the weekly timeframe and plotting channels and support/resistance areas coupled with a few basic candlestick formations also helps to put each VyNNeR signal in context. On the weekly chart recently there was 'bearish engulfing' price action at the top of a significant channel line...a strong caution against VyNNeR longs imo. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Hi all. After seeing that some of you have brokers/charts showing slightly different data...in terms of the below trade, if you didn't get an entry signal it was just as well because i was stopped out after following all the entry criteria as per the charts provided by IG Markets...the live trade was actually placed with Oanda . I haven't been catching ALL the setups on this swing system (I missed that last big short trade..damnit !) however, the ones I HAVE traded all seem to show an overbought situation and thus the price inevitably reversed as it did again today....man, where am i going wrong ?

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Thanks for sharing ChowClown. I must admit that I still find using S/R, pivot points, channels etc effectively a bit elusive. Could you be so kind as to post an illustration of what you were speaking of here? My previous question to VyNNer regarding S/R is what data does he use for the calculations ie. the previous month, week, day etc ? Can you please advise me on this ? I've done a google seach and have found a pivot point and S/R calculator at http://www.fxstreet.com/forex-tools/...nt-calculator/ Do you think this would be sufficient ? Your estimation was certainly correct regarding caution on going long...we've seen cable turn to the downside after the basic swing trade setup criteria was met. VyNNer has mentioned before that price action must also be considered and that's where your input is invaluable...and I hope that VyNNer can also elaborate on this so that I can get a better understanding of price action factors that can influence this system. Hoping to hear more from you soon. mike

hi have anyone did buy at 2.0409?? Seem bit quite here.......

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hi mikelath, I've tried trading with formal pivots but in the end gain more from looking at a chart and picking out support/resistance zones. Formal definitions/calcs work for many traders, but i'm not comfortable with them. Each to their own. Here's a weekly chart - just 3 trend lines from the more significant (significant to my grey cells at least!) highs/lows, which I think might contain price action over the next few weeks...i should probably use dotted lines, just as a reminder that anything is possible!

--- 帖子 #864 ---
...so now (i'm using FXCM 's PowerCharts), the EMAs are crossing (have yet to close crossed) short. Regardless of whether entries are taken on "crossing" or "close crossed" EMAs, the key for me now is to wait and see how price behaves at the previous support areas...will they turn to resistance to fuel a short signal, or will they hold to generate a new long signal...my bias from the weekly chart is short but I'll wait for price to give more information. The waiting helps to reduce whipsaw as the EMAs begin to spiral.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Hi all traders, You guys can try daily pivots for strong support and resistance on the day itself where we have our signals from the swing setup. S/R like CPP, R1, R2, R3, S1, S2, S3, M1 to M4.. i take the opening hours at 0700 GMT +8 By the way i did not take the long signal because my daily filter still shows down on stochs but i believe some traders in this thread does not follow the daily filter and yet grab good pips. My initial plan on the re-entry during the swing would be... Wait till the 13 and 4 recross on the same direction above the 50 for long and below 50 for short. Feel free to try it on demo. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hey guys this is what my chart looks like. A couple things to notice. S&amp;R has been mentioned, and if youll notice there is a double top there with both candles that formed the two tops having long upper wicks, To me thats a beware sign. When the 13 was at the 50 on the close of that candle my charts looked like a cross just like most of yours. Maybe this will help in future, Support and ressitance we need to look at the past candle patterns to see if there is any warning signs.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Nice couple posts on the merits of observing this often discarded staple of price activity! No matter which system, method, strategy (call them what you will) you utilize, they will all benefit from familiarizing yourself with the rudiments of supply &amp; demand (s&amp;r). Prices move, not because moving averages criss cross back &amp; forth or oscillators shift &amp; jerk from a 70 or 30 reading on your favored timeframe, but due to the basic forces of supply &amp; demand. And unsurprisingly, previous zones of confirmed s&amp;r have a high tendancy to react in a similar vein! Possessing a reasonable grasp of these lines of probability will, as ChowClown commented: assist in stacking the odds a little firmer in your favor.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Hi all traders, Anyone took the last short signal from the swing trade? I'm currently up about +98 pips .. Hope some of you catch this too.. VyNNeR

Thanks guys for the input on factors affecting price action. Looks like I'll need to use charting other than IG Markets...I double checked that for the last (false) long entry ALL criteria were met, including the daily filter ( Slow %K above Slow %D on the Daily Chart ), though only just....and low and behold, the daily filter kept me OUT of the current short trade ! I think I'll give MT4 a go as it seems to be a popular choice. happy pipsday.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Hi all traders, I received a few emails lately asking me to give an example on the re-entry rules for my swing trade system. You guys saw the short re-entry on GBP/USD according to my re-entry rules? We have another EMA4 and EMA 13 cross for the downside below the EMA50, while our daily sotch filter is also poiting down. Hope this helps. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Vynner could you tell me how you deal with situations like we had this week? do you get any profits when the market is swing too fast.. making unable to 13 ema pass the 50ema; do you leave your stop loss at -50? Thanks http://img354.imageshack.us/img354/3...lemovesia5.png [/url] Shot at 2007-08-10

Hi Everyone, I'm new here, been lurking for about a week. Nice work on the system Vynner and it's great everyone's getting into this. I just wanted to set the truth straight. I got the same results as that guy when automating this system using his pseudo-code as the basis for an EA. It quickly lost 50% of the account. However, his code does not accurately model this system. You can't run it like that or it buys and sells rapid-fire in any ranging market. It acts on a lot of EMA4/EMA13 re-crosses that it shouldn't. I'm a programmer by trade, and I made a quick hack to only look for recrosses of the 50 line. It was buggy because I haven't had the time to rewrite the way the original code works to handle recrosses. It's difficult to program this correctly because I have to "watch the past" for crosses. Anyway, over two years it gave a $1300 return on a $2000 account on the GBP/USD. It lost $200 on a $2000 account on the USD/CHF. It lost $300 on a $2000 account on the USD/JPY with a drawdown of about 20%. The problem with it is that it makes zero net pips for about 6 months and then suddenly the market makes a big move and it bags a huge profit. I'm not comfortable with it as-is right now so I'm rewriting the code. I want a smoother equity curve that doesn't look like steps. I'm thinking of using the slope of a 78 or 90 period SMA or EMA to determine the direction of the trend so it doesn't trade counter-trend or in a ranging market. Any thoughts on that? Let me make sure I have the system down though before I go any further with testing: - Enter long/short when EMA4 crosses EMA50 and then EMA13 crosses EMA50 - Use daily Stoch as filter - Set stop at 50 - Exit when EMA4 crosses over EMA13 to other side - DO NOT re-enter if EMA4 crosses back over EMA13 without both crossing over EMA50 to other side - repeat Is there anything I'm missing? Edit: My code is officially doing some wacky stuff so those results might improve. It's the remnants of that pseudocode posted in the middle of the thread, we can't use that.

i guess we cant really entre now as it's getting too much risk any one did ?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
If everything stays as it is according to the system on the next open candle there is a valid long entry. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #878 ---
First, thanks, VyNNeR for this nice system! I am using software, where the time zone can be set, so I set it GMT +8, because that's the VyNNeR's zone, when developing the system as far as I know so it should work best there. And right now all the indicators show that there will be a long signal soon, the 4EMA already crossed the 50EMA, the daily stoch says yes for a long position, and if the price goes on moving this way the 13EMA is going to cross the 50EMA very soon in a sharper angle, which is a good sign according to some previous posts. Till the open of the new candle remain 4 more minutes here. Let's hope it crosses well, there will be no surprises and everyone take some good pips on this. Good luck all! PS: Right now the 50EMA is 1.9932 and the 13EMA is 1.9915.

There was a cross on the open of the next candle so I'm long @ 2.0064.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
it's going down.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
I've not got a cross, different Brokers I bet + time... and also the Stochs are oversold on 4 hour.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
can anyone confirm this signal?

--- 帖子 #883 ---

Dear all fellow traders, Hope you guys enjoying the ride. I'm currently about +200 on this swing down. VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Thanks once again to Vynner for this great strategy. I am currently up 248 ticks.I can only hope others have understood this simple strategy and have taken advantage of it.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Hello guys Does anyone else but me see the signal coming up in GU for short entry? Is it correct? Is the system working correctly now at this market?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Yes thats correct, normally I will Tp only 50pips if the cross occured.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Look at this picture! so bad. so bad... Maby we should used traling stop? last month gbp was bad boy. VyNNeR whats is wrong? How it could occur?

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Anyone trading this anymore or have we all given up?????

--- 帖子 #896 ---
I believe GBP/USD has been bad for all mid term time frame for the last 2 months. This pair is trying to find a direction until yesterday that it broke back below 2.0000. I'm still trading this swing system for your information. I am now trying to figure a better stop loss for this system. Did you guys use the daily filter to mnimise whipsaw effect on ranging days in 4Hours charts? VyNNeR

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Yes I am checking the system everyday to see if there is any entry points, but for a long time it seemed that system is not working very well cause cable lately is behaving very weird to say at least it started moving about 300 pips a day in different directions thats why I think there was no clear signals for entry. looking at the charts right now it should have been a good entry at 2.0450 and it kept going down and still is going down but the entry was not very clear so I thought it is a wrong signal again. Any other opinions about the system right now?

--- 帖子 #898 ---
I agree. I was also thinking is there any way to find better SL.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Looks as if it the GBP/USD might generate a BUY signal for us very soon. Keep an eye for that one. Other pairs to watch (paper trade) EUR.CAD I Bought @ 1.4410 AUD.JPY : Sell- waiting CAD.JPY : Sell- waiting Any comments.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Thanks for the reminder, but what about USD.CHF in TF D1? Is it the same?

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Didi anyone actually try to use this system on other pairs? I have tried with EUR/USD works pretty much ok and USD/CAD sometimes it generates good signals. Any comments on other pairs? HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Hi VyNNeR, I came across forexproindicator through one of my trading friends and im very interested into buying it. May i know what time is the signal being sent ? and based on what time frame ??? thanks in advance .

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Heads up everyone it might be time for a buy in the gbpusd. Or is it 4hrs too late? Charts upoaded...

--- 帖子 #904 ---
I have since moved on and now after trading London Forex Rush only trade cable once a day on London Forex Open. Been a little quiet this last 2 weeks but does seem to provide mechanical entries once a day, plenty for me. Personally, short to medium term I am bullish cable. W.

Hi Dear Plain and simple trading system. Great full, if you post the whole Strategy - System once again with all the new updates and changes. Looking forward for your reply.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Hi Vynner I tried your strategy in USD/CHF &amp; USD/JPY, it worked well. Its a good strategy. Planning to implement in other pairs, when rules come true .... Thanks for the great strategy.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
i really like your GBP/USD Swing Trade strategy it looks simple and easy. Is it only can trade on 4 hour chart?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Going to start using this strategy! Looks like we have a valid signal at 14:00 GMT today? Can anyone confirm? Daily stocks have crossed (K above D) and on 4 hour chart EMA 4 is above EMA 50 Looking from past comments this system works pretty well. I look forward to trading it with you all

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Hi there VyNNeR, so it's now 2013... How's the strategy going? I must say I stumbled across it a few months ago and have been demo'ing it. I really like it, thank you for sharing it. I just had a few questions... 1) what broker have you been using as surely you need to have guaranteed overnight stops? (Any UK members thoughts) 2) did you stay at 50 pip stop or did you end up increasing it? 3) if the ema 4,13 crossed prematurely did you re-enter the trade or did you sit it out until it crossed the 50 again? If you did re-enter what were you're criteria? thank you again for posting this strategy.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
It's 2014 now, I stumbled on this a week ago. Will definitely try this. Thanks Vynner, you're so UNselfish. Thank you

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hey wolfgangfx I just saw this as well and will be testing it. How has it been going??

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Thanks VyNNeR for your thread. Its really nice and informative. It has a good source of information for beginners like me. I hope this thread is still active. Hey wolfgangfx, I am also on the same boat. Please share your findings.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Still using this technic and it's very profitable. Good strategy

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hi All, is there anyone still using this simple swing strategy?

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Keeping this thread alive! GBPUSD has been in a strong downtrend, but with confirmation on the Daily chart, we may now be seeing a Long trade setup forming on the 4 hour chart. It could be 1, 2 or more new bars from now...let's see.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Nope. Looks like the downward momentum is not finished yet. It's been a long wait for the next trade..

--- 帖子 #917 ---
We finally have a valid LONG trade entry. With a stop at 50 pips, given the long previous bar, there's more risk of the stop being taken out with a pullback. But, we're in the game!

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Stopped out. Waiting for another entry.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
I believe in 2nd chances. And we got another entry which made +127 pips. Minus the last - 50 pip stopout we're net +77 pips. Happy days.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Hello VyNNer is this strategy working till date?

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hello sir i tried to setup this strategy, unfortunatly i didn't find the indicators... so can u plz upload it sir?

--- 帖子 #922 ---
After a nice trend up we now have a Short entry, confirmed on the D1 Stochastic.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Just when I thought we had a trade exit, literally at the last minute of the H4 candle, the moving average had crossed...but then in the final seconds, price dropped and the EMA4 remained below the EMA13 at the open of the next candle. . So we're still in the trade, which means I now need to check again at 4 o'clock in the morning! Nevertheless, it's been a good trade so far.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
What impact will the interest rate decision have on GBP?

--- 帖子 #925 ---
At 4 o'clock this morning I closed the trade, at the open of the next bar after the EMA's crossed. Checking in later I found that price had then plummeted, which would've resulted in bigger profits. Buy hey, I followed the rules and as they say, "that's trading". You'll notice I had 2 positions on. The first one was entered manually as per the rules with a +1.78R profit. The second one was entered by an EA I tried to program for the strategy but somehow it entered later. That booked a +1.46R profit and I closed it manually along with the first one. I was very lucky that a stop hunt didn't take out the 1st position, so it was somewhat a blessing in disguise to have an EA enter a trade after momentum was confirmed. Now I'll need to decide whether I want to continue using it as is.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
any setup today guys?

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Looks like there could be the next LONG trade setup forming soon. By the time the EMA's cross, the D1 Stochastic should have also confirmed.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Entry LONG.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I got caught out by NFP and forgot to close the trades earlier. Closing the trades at the EMA cross, the standard entry position gained +6pips and the revised EA (with entry at Close of the new bar) was stopped out for -50pips. That's +0.12R and -1R respectively. I'm now considering that, instead of a delayed entry 2nd position, having a pilot trade with a smaller position size, entering at the EMA4 / EMA50 cross to anticipate the trend. Let's see if it makes or breaks the strategy.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Due to lifestyle factors (sometimes having to be awake when I should be sleeping), I'm not primarily trading this strategy, but get this setup from earlier today!

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Exit of the Short trade: +127 pips or +2.54R.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Long entry. The MA's had crossed at the start of the new H4 candle, but price has now retraced, showing the MA's separated again. If it stops out we'll look for a re-entry..

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Stopped out for -1R. Price then took off to the upside while I slept. Waiting for a pullback to re-enter.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Re-entered at 1.31689. Keeping it simple...no EA.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
I love this trading strategy, and I am glad that the thread is alive I opened a long position at 1.31625 yesterday, but closed it because EMA4 and EMA13 dead-crossed with the open candle at 04:00(GMT+3)...

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Yes, it's a great strategy. My re-entry was stopped out, again. The issue being that I missed the initial entry which would not have been stopped out, and price has now taken off. I'll now need to be patient and wait for the next trade.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Another factor is that different brokers will show the Ma's differently. Here's a trade still open:

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Good! I, too, have a long position opened at 12:00 on 22th. I am just waiting for the closing sign... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #939 ---
an update on gbp/usd for sell position , am targeting 130 pips dawn with gbp/usd with 45 pips stoploss as you can see the chart.your comment please

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Regardless of whether your trade will work out or not, I wonder what triggered your entry; it seems to me to be totally random: there was no retest of higher levels, no break or resistance, price is still in the range that started more than 10 hours ago

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thank you for your comment Josi, but the beauty of trading is to know where the market will trend to before trending,and set you stoploss before takes profit.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
thousands of trading strategy, we can only choose one of them that is working for us steadily

--- 帖子 #191 ---

--- 帖子 #192 ---
