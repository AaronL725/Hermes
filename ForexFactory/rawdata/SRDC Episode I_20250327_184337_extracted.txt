Hi Traders,

Ive been away for quiet sometime due to personal and business reasons. But everything is Pipastic!

Im a starting this new thread to help newbies like me to add to our ever growing need to learn and grow. Not to compare and judge but to expand our knowledge in this exciting new era of electronic fx trading where anyone can participate to trade forex and transform their lives forever.

Another reason is, after many months of forward testing this method (out of 9 that my team develops), i think, its time to EA it on MT4. You will know the reason why, i need to EA this method after reading the attach document.

Its a very simple method and very effective. Excellent for newbies and professional alike.

So, EA programmers out there, please take a look at it and when you dont mind, help us to create an EA of this method and let the fun begin!

Humbly yours,

OrangeRoshan

p/s Constructive Ideas and help welcome!

the theory is a bit similar with Mouteki, using the support and demand line. but without the trend line.

SL are set between 20 - 30. but daily movement would be more than 50 pips, i'm sure the SL would be hit in most trades. don't you think so?

Raya! :

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Yes and No.

Believe it or not, i sometimes didnt put stoploss for the reason you put forward. This I learned from a prominent trader which i rather not named. He didnt put a stoploss when he knows the trend. Knowledge on Fundamentals are important.

However after forward testing it for so many months, I noticed everytime the price hit either the support or resistance, the price rides to my desire takeprofits, which is usually between 5 to 50 (depending on the daily and weekly high and lows).

From experience, 20-30 SL is safe.

Yes, its silimar to mouteki in terms of having no indicators but, this is much simpler and Ive been using it for many years (since 1993) on manual trading via telephone and telex. Using Internet trading, its more effective because I can execute my trades almost instantenously.

i'll do some backtest later. you're not in KB, are you?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I always get confused about chart times.  My charts start a new day at 0100 GMT, is this significant in determining the high and low of yeserday's bar?  Otherwise, your high and low may not be the same as mine.  If the method requires that the daily bar starts at say the beginning of the US session, the only way I could replicate this would be to switch to hourly bars and pick out the ones that correspond to this timeframe.

Or does it really matter anyway?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Good Question!

Im running my live and demo accounts on 6 platforms. Where 3 of them are MT4 platforms with 3 different opening times. This is what we have observed:

1. Day high and lows are different due to the platform opening times

2. Therefore Daily candles differ a little bit based on the above and due to broker spreads and wits.

However, the method can still be implemented regardless of these issues. Backtest your daily candles and it will give you much confidence.

I hope that helps.

Do u still use tigal abdul tlatomi ?  :

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yes and No.

Tiga Abdul has 3 versions now and its part of my team's existing system. However the 3A tlatomi method has evolved to ver. 5B now. More aggresive and more profitable and still on trial, forwardtesting on live account.

In later stage of SRDC method, i will show how to incooperate 3AT with this method. Its part of a bigger system for a more powerful system of entry and exit.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi,

Any idea when new 3A tlatomi method will come out ?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Not for now.

Anyway the new version is Tiga Abdul Breakout system Ver. 5B. Its exits somehow partly depends on SRDC method.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
How can we get hold of this? Is there any link for this method? Thanks Orange! Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Sorry, Im not realesing it yet.

GBPUSD and EURUSD just broke the 20pips tp. Im still awaiting for the AUDUSD. Fantastic!

Cant help it Ak! I get sick when i dont trade! I Love trading!!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Same here, just got back from Sabah. I have already had 3 days off-trading. I love trading too..even if im loosing...who doesnt??!!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
BTW, as for my point of view about this method, to backtest it, using the daily bar is not a good idea.

Why? Because if the yesterday's high is broken, there are still posibilities that the price goes back down for sometime before contineu rising back up and therefore SL could have been hit. We cannot see that on daily bar. The best is that backtest it on 1hr time frame.

Just my 2 mini lot point of view.

OrangeRoshan's SRDC method

Orange, this method along with James16 price action looks great.

I've been using James' price action with the previous day's and week's high and low (also the overall trend,fibs, pivots and 365 ema)to add support and resistance confluence.

The key is confluence (other indications not indicators)with price action.

I'll show examples.

Jim

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Examples (I miss wrote outside bars. It should read Inside Bar)

Example ( I should post these on the James16 thread ) red doted line 365 ema

What is a stoploss? Simple, to stop your losses:

a) When the trend is the reverse of your trade, losses is minimised

b) Not to get of  a trade during a temporary reversal.

I see your point. When in doubt about the stop loss, put a bigger SL. Because average penetration of S&R is +-50pips. Or, dont put a SL at all. Not recommended when still a newbie tho.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes, I agree because it helps to filter the trades. I didnt mentioned it because, i donot want to make the method too complicated (as it is, it can be very profitable too) and dont have too much time to explain it in details.

But, you are welcome to elaborate it here, as it will help lots of good traders who wants to learn.

Welcome to Hapi Pipland Abg!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Im a Newbie and always be...my FF name said so

Actually i use this on one of my trading method unfortunatly I fail to realise using daily bar, we could get higher % of winning. I usually view a 5min or 15min time frame and enter any recent Support or resistance. This could help me keep on more to winning side.

Keep rocking OrangeRoshan!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yupz, I have an aperantice who changed the rule and trade using lower time frame. The result: Disasterous! Daily candles gives a save Margin of pips especially during news. When it penetrates, it PENETRATES like a jedi saber!

Try this: 5 pips only for each major pairs. The 3 monkeys I mentioned in my doc, will give u 15pips total of quality pips!

Fomula: 5pips + spread + 1pip: SL Zero (or 25 for you maybe, hehehee)

Put pending orders on a finish daily candle (like when we straddle). Goto sleep and see your account gain weight the next day!

All the best lol

--- 帖子 #28 ---
can we trade during news time which move the market for more than 50 pips? or no trade during news announcement?

hopefully my account gained weight as you said, just like i'm gaining weight pasal open house inda beranti LOL

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Trade anytime as long as the S&R are being penetrated. When you see the trade is 30pips away from either S or R, then place your stop orders. Like I said, when it penetrates, It penetrates!!

The easier way, is placing the stop orders way ahead. This is one of the reason why i created this thread, to see when anyone can comeup with a good EA for it.

So, place your sotp orders and check your account weight tomorrow!! hahahaa

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Here are the results of yesterday's trade on the 3 majors:

GBPUSD: +120 pips

EURUSD: +77 pips

AUDUSD: +15pips

However, as I was buzy celebrating Raya, my Tp was only 50 for each except for AUDUSD, which is 20pips

GBPUSD: +50pips

EURUSD: +50pips

I let the AUDUSD to ride since yesterday and eventually get my +20pips just now!

AUDUSD: +20pips

Total Trade: +120pips

Pipastic!!

Orange:

Thanks for sharing your system, I got my first 5 pips today with eur/usd and waiting for the other 5 from gbp/usd. I have a question, you place your orders right at high / low of last day?, and how far do you place a trailing stop?.

thanks.

roger

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Orange,

Does the broker/platform's timezone matters in determing the "real" daily candle?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Wait until a new candle emerges. Add 1pips + spread above or below the S&R.

Regarding trailing stop, it all depends on the currency pair. Anything with YEN, usually demands min of 30TL. EURGBP usually need only 10, and most other pairs 15. This is my usual TL, fm experience.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Not really. There is no such thing as real daily candle. Different bank gives different quotes. Similarly different broker gives different quotes & spreads. What is important, the candle on your platform, unless your platform gives 20 spread on EURGBP!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Its been another excellent day as minimum target of 5pips for each of the 3 pair are being hit!

GBPUSD: 5pips

EURUSD: 5pips

AUDUSD: 5pips

Total: 15pips (sweet!!)

Now, the trades are riding with SL being adjusted. As I type this, AUDUSD is over 30pips, GBPUSD is also over 20pips and EURUSD is over 10pips!!

Simple system that works!!

Isn't it Fantastic!!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
From the last data being released, Dollar is starting to weaken. Therefore expect GBP, EUR & AUD to bull their way to the next galaxy!!

Pipastic!!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
My TL got hit and here are pips made for Friday Oct 27th

GBPUSD: 62pips

EURUSD: 40pips

AUDUSD: 69pips

Pipastic!!

Fundamental update:

Cable is destined to rise against the weaken dollar as the cable interest rate is projected to increase. With this news, cable will strengtened and when the news is confirm, expect bullish cable all the way!!

Welcome to Hapi Pipland!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Just made +50 pips using the system on GBPUSD, . I like it because it simple. I combine this system with fibo S&R for Profit taking.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Just incase you are wondering how in the world I get over 60+pips on AUD?

Well, thats the power of fundamentals, I bought it when the AUD went for a dive at the barrier reef! about 20pips extra.

As I type, the pairs are still climbing!

Fantastic!!

Ther are refering to GOLDEX, the Internet Forex IB in Brunei and Traders who are collecting money from individuals for the purpose of Forex investment without having any license.

Forex trading as an individual is not ban but not encouraged. I think the authorities were ill informed about most of the good traders activities in Brunei. To my judgement, some are world class. Considering our population of 300,000 only, its amazing!

But as a whole, I agree they should ban Goldex because they have mislead the Bruneian. They claimed to be licensed which they are not and they spread and commision are ridicilously high. They also claimed to be the number one platform in the world!! Daaaaaa....

But, i think we just mind our own business for now. Lay low as the regulation in our country is still vague. When the government open our currency to the whole world in the near future, i bet you, they will need pros (with 9 digit income in the bank as credential) to help them.

Hi Orange Roshan,

No offence, just want to learn more from you.

What would you do if the new daily candle move up/down initially but reverse later ?

- wait for the stop loss to set in and reverse the trade ?

- wait until candle daily closed, hopefully stop loss not hit or candle continue its original path ?

In your past experience, how often have you encountered such reversals ?

What is your recommended action ?

cheers !

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hmm.. i dont quiet get your question but ill try to help you with my inderstanding of your question.

Break the profit target into 3, T1, T2, T3 in this percentage 70%, 20%, 10%. T1 is 5pips, T2 is the next 10pips and T3 is up to you. Move your stops accordingly. Should it reverses, losses is truly minimise.

With the 3 pairs i recommended, it is very rare to have such reversal. In order to understand this method (using S&R), S=R. Take a scenario during an infantry (war) invasion. Imagine when the British wants to attack the Germans. The British army either has to attack France or Belgium 1st in order to get into Germany. They cannot swiftly attack both countries without any resistance. But when they succeed, they will eventually attack the Germans.

Pardon my example. Like S&R, the price will take time to penetrate the S&R, they (the British Army) might have to go back to the nearest base to get some more ammunation again & again, but eventually when they succeed in breaking the resistance/Support they USUALLY wont retreat, they will move forward quiet far!!

Like i said, with the Daily candle, WHEN IT PENETRATES, IT PENETRATES! Minimum around 5pips + spread. A good enough trade in terms of quality pips.

Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
ha.....that is an interesting way to explain your points. I think I got your points...thanks .......

--- 帖子 #53 ---
If price rises above/below support/resistance  more than once in a day  do you  place a new order each time e.g. price rises, I enter order, take profit at 10 pips, price falls past stop loss then rises above/below support/resistance again, do I open another order?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Excellent Question!

The answer is NO. The move may already been exausted, therefore price penetration may cease.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Just done studying this method on GBP/USD. 5pips is like 98% garenteed! Half of the time we can get more then 50 pips. How simple can trading forex be?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi,

I apologize for bringing tlatomi discussion to this thread, but at The tlatomi method thread are some new guys, I do not see you there any more and I would like to get your opinion because I like very much your opinions and advices about trading forex...

BTW, I like this simple method you presented here and I will try it for sure...

Regarding tlatomi, I found that NonLag indicator (yellow line) is all you need for collecting 10 pips profit, you can turn off other two indicators...

I have started to backtesting it yesterday, 24 trades through April and May give 10 pips for sure... I have found 2-3 times yellow after yellow signal( I didnt get to these trades in backtesting yet), but the reason for that was BOE rate statement so it can be avoided ( no trading at these BIG days)...

So, opinion is appreciated...

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

I tried to make an EA for your method:

At midnight it sets pending orders on the previous days high and low.

Exit is by profit target, trailing stop or stop loss and remaing positions are closed at the end of the day (The 70%, 20%, 10% rule is a little harder to implement, because you need to keep track of 3 orders – or am I missing something?)

Please take a look.

It's surely not optimal, yet. So any suggestions are welcome. For example, should the second order be deleted when the first gets triggered?

Backtesting suggests it works best on GBPUSD and with larger sl/tp targets. Though striving for 5 pips will give you ~90% winning trades, the costs of spread and remaining loosers seem to kill it.

Excellent. You have discover what traders called "success trading rythm" or "Holy Grail". It is a method whom you feel most comfortable and feel in control. Many traders were looking for the holy grail in the wrong places. Stay with it and make it your own system.  This way, consistent pips can be made. Visit http://www.robbooker.com/Strategy10.pdf, as this will reinforce your 10pips strategy.

With this method, you are quiet right to avoid News and EMAs are lagging indicators and they couldnt cope with volatile markets unlike S&R.

Welcome to Hapi Pipland.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
When this EA is perfected, I will continue with Level 2 of this method to triple its capability in mining pips using 1hr chart and FIBO. Yes, It works best with cable.

Thanks for such a great team player

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Iya,

Im backtesting the EA and it misses a lot of trades. I will post the chart from the visual later today.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Iya,

Just an idea, Can an EA be programmed to do the followings:

1) To exit any trade on the next candle when a new candle emerges

2) To move its stoploss to 5pips profits when the trades is above xpips, say x = 35pips. x can be entered manually like the SL

3) To adjust the stop loss with an extra 10pips when the price 5pips near to SL.

4) True/False on SL

Thanks

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Iya,

I notice two things:

1) It lost good profits when it doesnt exit on a start of a new candle.

2) Some trades are not activated when TP is 5pips.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
wouldn't brokers treat the 5 pips TP as scalping? also, which broker did you use to fowardtest this method?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hmmm.. Interesting Question.

All brokers love scalpers. This way they make multiple spreads and commissions. However, getting 5 pips using a strategy that is consistently winning is not scalping. In my opinion, there is also nothing wrong with scalping. I have a trading friend who trade in yards not lots. He gets off the market after 5pips. I asked him why 5pips? why not 10 or 100? He smiled, and said to me, "Winnings and 100% consistent is the goal". I agree with him, especially when a single trade is in billions!

I forwardtesting my method in a number of platforms, IBFX, Multibank, GCI, Dukascopy and a proprietory platform with a personal hub.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
true.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Should be easy. Let's just see if I got it correctly:

1) We exit on the open of the second candle after the trade triggered.

2) No problem

3) Isn't it the same to make the SL just 10pips larger?

4) No SL at all? Maybe set it to 1000 pips for the moment.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Could you look in the results or log what happened to these trades, because I couldn't reproduce it. Maybe it's something about slippage. Is this even possible with pending orders? Sorry I'm still a noob. :

Probably backtesting isn't very reliable on large 'jumps' e.g., on news events.

And what timeframe do you have in mind when there's a new candle, 1H?

Edit:

Well here's the new version. You can now choose the time when the orders are set. My best result was 13:00 CET – int the heat of the London session!

There are also more exit strategies. You can disable most of them by setting them to 0 (KISS). Pretty effective was to close a trade after one 1H candle – 'no matter what'. This way it usually gets the biggest move and also cuts loosers short.

Happy testing!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I hope I explained it correctly too..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Sorry,

I didn't want to triple post, but got carried away phoning and coding.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Iya,

The Trades is always in Daily chart (D1) time frame. What i mean is broker's time. Some broker starts their daily candle early, and viceversa. Or can we make it automatic, following the broker's time?

Here are the trades that are missing and its trade summary.

You are doing great, im learning from you.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Interesting!! Now we are talking!! Im now backtesting it while in hyperspace!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Ahh, alright. Please dont use daily candles for the new version. Everything less should actually give almost identical results, as long as your start time falls on the beginning of a new candle. For example closing after one 1H candle should be the same as closing after 4 15M candles, shouldn't it? But there seem to be some minor differences.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Iya,

In 1hr, the pip difference at S&R is too tight.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
No, we're still trading on a daily basis, i.e., high and low of the last 24 hours. But the expert now uses the information of smaller timeframe candles, to get entry and exit right.

I hope it still works as intended, because we know optimizing an expert can sometimes change its strategy fundamentally.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Theres some truth with what you said. Im using IBFX for this EA, and a new daily candle opens at 6am Spore time. Thats what I want to catch. I think we are -11hrs EST.

But, somehow, I have a feeling the EA is too much away from what it originally intended.

Heres an idea:

1) can you follow the brokers time?

2) try buying and selling signal not from S&R, but buying from Open and closing of the previous daily candle.

ie: buy when the current price is (Spread+ 1pip) > yesterdays closing price and viceversa. This is actually level 2 trades of SRDC method.

What is border?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The problem is different versions of MetaTrader from different brockers show different times and even candles. I think if you want to setup the trades at 06:00 brocker time you should set start_time = 6. (What's "spore time"? )

These time zones drive me crazy. A new daily candle should form at the opening of Tokio, right? I couldn't even find consistent information if this means 23:00 GMT or 00:00 GMT; on my charts it's labeled 00:00.

"Border" means the 'safety' distance we add to the high and low when setting up the trades. I wanted to call it 'margin' but that was too ambigous. Probably better to rename it distance or simply delete it.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Thank you Iya. Let get back to the original concept of SRDC, Simple yet effective. I have feeling the federation knows where we are, opps, i mean i have a feeling we will get the EA right, one way or another! Peace!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I dont know S#:% about coding an EA but this system WORTH making one.

EA~ (dom dom dom) EA~ (dom dom dom)

Nice Job iya. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Thanks Orange for this simple and effective trading method !

I'm trying to backtest latest SRDC EA but it does't open any trade :|

I'm also starting yesterday to forward test but no orders was opened even if I changed start time from 0 to 1.

Any suggest ?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
It has been another good trading days for SRDC method. Both AUDUSD and GBPUSD has already hit the minimum 5pips.

As I type this, AUD is rising to breakeven point after a 25pip dip. GBP on the otherhand is retracing and could move even higher. I bank-in 45pips for this pair. EURUSD is still having no trade.

Conclusion: 2 winning trades & 1 no trade (so far)

Pipastic!!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The Ea is still under dvevelopment by Iya and not done yet. Lets just say, its still under testing.

anyone wants to have a go and help Iya?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
When anyone straddle the small weekend daily candle, definitelly all 3 pair gives more than 5 pips each.

AUDUSD both S&R gives 5 each = 10pips

EURUSD both S&R gives 5 each = 10pips

GBPUSD Resistance only gives 5pips = 5pips

Total 25 QUALITY pips!!

Fantastic isnt it!! Simple, of course!!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Remember the classic I hate monday thingy? Bob Geldof sang  a song about it. Monday huh!! Who likes Monday? After a long weekend, back to work!

Hahahahaa... Not anymore!! With SRDC method you will love monday!!! Look at the sunday/monday TINY candle. Apply SRDC method and what do you see? TAKE 3 MINUTES PLEASE!

EXACTLY!!

YES, its pure quality pips all week round. Imagine you only trade once every monday with a bit bigger Risk%? What do you have? A FAT ACCOUNT!!

Enjoy your weekend and trade just on monday and rest for the whole weekdays and double your account every month.

p/s when you are married, its time to talk to your wife about paying the mortgage half the time... and how about a new 600 mercedes benz? a trip to BRUNEI and knok on my dorr and said, THANK YOU!!

hahahaaa.....

Trading made ez!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Orange,

i was able finally to start backtest but it seems that high/low for yesterday candle are calcuated in wrong way, so i changed this code :

Inserted Code

// Collect highs and lows
double high = 0,
low  = 99999;
for (int i = 0; i < PERIOD_D1/Period(); i++)
{ if(high < High[i])
high = High[i];
if(low > Low[i])
low = Low[i]; }

with this :

Inserted Code double high = iHigh(NULL,PERIOD_D1,1);
double low  = iLow(NULL,PERIOD_D1,1);

so checking manually it seems that now orders are opened correclty based on previous high/low.

Sadly when i try to perform backtest on EURUSD with MT4 on past six month with full alpari data , result are not good.

I used these settings to backtest :

BORDER=5;

START_TIME=0;

LOTS=0.1;

STOPLOSS=20;

TAKEPROFIT=60;

MOVE_SL_AT=35;

MOVE_SL_TO=5;

CLOSE_AFTER_N_CANDLES=1;

TRAILSTOP=0;

SLIPPAGE=0;

What the need to use border value ? It eats 5 pips before enter trade. Isn't supposed that SRDC have to enter trade when price > spread+1+high (if buy) without that border value?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Fantastic!!

I will test it tonight after midnight. Change the border to 1.

Can you disable/enable the SL and will it run on Daily candle?

I would prefer to trade daily candle, that way, no matter what platform you put, the EA will start calculating when a new daily candle emerges.

Thanks for the participation. Pipholic!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Here you will find fixed version

Thx to you Orange

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Done? Im so exited to farwardtest this on my demo. Good Job!!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I dunno why i cant save to HTML after testing (it came out on notepad instead! It used to be ok), but on a USD10,000 account with maximum mini lots allowed which is 50 lots. The Account double to $21,000++. Most realiable backtest I can get with 89.9% modeling is from 10th October 06 until today. Thats approximatelly +- weekends about 2 weeks trade. Not bad!!

My settings on IBFX are:

Border 1

StartTime 4

Lots 50

SL 0

TP 300

Move Sl at 45

Move SL to 5

Close candle 24

Trail 0

Slippage 3

But, I have a feeling, the trades are not exactly as intended. Rightly pointed out by Iya. But, who cares! Now More modification and this version will go forwardtesting starting NOW!

To which folder should I extract ???

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Expert folder

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Why do you set Close candle to 24 ? In this way EA will close pending orders after 24 days, instead to be closed on next candle. Am I wrong?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok I'm still not able to open pending orders with SRDC EA so i moved on another famous breakout EA and changed it to fit Orange's original S&R Daily rules (i hope ).

I called it SRDCv2 , settings are almost the same as SRDC , there is only EOD (end of day) that is time for closing orders/pending orders at end of day and should be set at 23 just 1 hour before new daily candle will be opened.

I'm starting forward test with these settings :

StartTime = 2; // begin of the first session; time adjust by your broker time

BORDER = 1; // pips we add to the high and low to get entry price

EOD = 23; // time for closing orders at end of day

StopLoss = 20;

MOVE_SL_AT = 35; // if an order reaches this profit level...

MOVE_SL_TO = 5; // ...adjust SL to this profit level

TrailingStop = 50;

TakeProfit = 100;

Lots = 0.5;

Slippage = 0;

I checked and pending orders now are correctly opened ...well let's see if it will be Pipastic eheheh !

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Yeah, that's what I used in the first version, too.

The point was to seperate the high and low from the daily candle, so you could use any 24 hour period.

I get only one candle for sunday/monday combined (Alpari).

So we wouldn't get the same results when depending on the daily candle.

A'kum

Just ggiving my 2pips, it might not be relevant after all but i believe you already have a good system in srdc...but there is one small nagging issue. The problem will arise when there is a little too much ecstasy, in making an ea, although noble i might suggest against it as it makes ur complacent and become too trusting...

Many traders face this issue, they found a good system and they spoil it by trying to perfect it. I like your system the way it is High Low, Support and Resistance...simple and effective no sugar added.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Excellent!!

Thanks for the compliment and I agree 100% about discreaniary trading (manual) is always better than Robot trading (EA). The question is, For how long? Ever read book by Robert T. Kiyosaki, The cash Flow Quadrant? It talks about generating passive income is better than active income.

I am trading manually and making $$ with it, but what happens when I choose to retire? Even when the EA gives only 10% a month, I will be happy, at least I can use my othertime doing other things that I really wanted to do.

This is what this tread is about. A forum for new and experience trader to help me build an EA based on a successful system. I give my system, the forum give me an EA. Everybody's happy. A well paid 2way charity.

Isnt it fantastic!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Iya,

When Alpari doesnt give you that cute candle, use IBFX demo and trade on your Alpari. Just do it every Monday. Tue, Wed, Thu & Friday, use your Alpari candles.

How that for an idea?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hahahaaa.... I dont know really, but thats the settinmg for the best result. Is that what it is? closing candle in a day? hahahaaaa...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yeaaa... baby, thats what im talking about. Ill besttest it now, while my platform harvest pips. Heheee..

Thanks

--- 帖子 #100 ---
The trades from 10th Oct until today gives over 20% returns. Excellent.

My settings are as follows:

Starttime 2

Border 1

EOD 23

SL 35

M SL@ 35

M SL to 20

TS 0

TP 120

Lots 1

Slippage 3

Anyone knows when I put 2eas on 2 different charts on the same platform, will it work properly? Anyone?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I think it should work just fine...

I am developing my own OrangeRoshan SRDC method EA and it runs fine on GBP/USD and EUR/USD charts...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thank you.

Can you post the EA here?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I do not think it should be posted yet, because it only opens two orders at the beginning of a new daily bar, you have to close orders manually...

I must implement closing of the orders, trailing and so on...

I am a newbie EA programmer, this were my first 3 hours of programming...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Ok, Get on with it and I wish you all the best. Let us know when it is done. Newbie or Pro, a coding is a coding. We never know...

May the pips be with you

--- 帖子 #105 ---
And now, something completely different...

What do you guys think about this strategy:

You find a guy who doesnt know nothing about trading, total beginner....

Give him a small real account for a trading.... He will probably blew it up in a week or two. The trick is, when he opens a position, you open also one on a BIG account but in opposite direction!

After the small one is closed, you find another guy and continue...

I will try to finish EA today evening ( I am from Croatia, now is 10:30 in the morning)... so, if everything will be fine, I will post it...

These are the previous Day high and low indicators I pick up from other thread. Just have a quick visual backtesting and found out that we can get +10 pips at London and US session breakouts. I am Going for Raya tonite

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hahahahaaa... yes I thought of that before. But, ever heard of beginners luck? It might be the path to the darkside. The Jedi councel may not approve it. Lets stick to Intelligent trading for now. LOL

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Yes, that may be and many others. Its so simple dunno why many didnt see it and continue to put a gazillion indicator on their chart hoping to filter trades and spot trades. I didnt say, Its not adviceable, because I also uses MAs on the SRDC level 2 but modestly. Most new traders are exposed to too many indicators, that they end up wrongly using it and failed miserably.

The most successful trader I know are using simple tool and basic techniques. Simple works.

Pipasticly true!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
SRDC level 2 actually shows similar techniques. It buys on reversal. I wont be posting it for now until the EA is properly done (just incase anyone asking).

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Orange did you try in forward test on demo account my latest EA SRDC v2 ? I'd like to receive your feedback to be sure that EA is working correctly

You can try at least to check if pending orders will be opened , just open a demo account and set Starttime as your actual broker time and EA should opens in few seconds all pending orders without needs to wait until midnight.

However in backtest any EA based on S&R Daily seems to be not profitable at all if a SL is set because most of time price hit pending orders so order is opened then retrace and hit SL

I also see that you usually don't put a SL, but this is a very high risk if you are planning to use an EA.

What do you think about this?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
May the force be with you.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Having two EAs on two different charts will only work if you have coded in the EA to generate trades with the so-called magic number else an EA will affect the trades of another EA and vice versa. I believe they call it magic numbers, don't remember the terminology....

--- 帖子 #113 ---
To sl or not to sl? That is the question Mr. Spock.

Frankly speaking, and probably this is not a good advice, I hardly use a stoploss (with the exception of Black Friday, once a month). I exit bad trades only when I know the longterm trend changes. However this needs experience on Fundamentals. Many websites like fxstreet and dailyfx gives good fundamentals outlook (just in case some padawan asked).

The idea of using an EA, for this method is NOT to use a SL at all. Implement it on a Mini account, say USD500. Then let the bot do the work. When it lose money, then stop using it. Its minimal risk. Most people lose more than USD500 on any given day even with a SL.

BUT, when the EA gives positive results and makes passive income for the trader who chose to take this path, then SL or no SL. I dont give a flip!!

Do what ever it takes intelligently as long as Jabba dont go knocking on your door,

Success, you will become.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Yes, now i remember. Thats true.

Ok, Padawan who have extra special ability in programming. Can we put the Magic number please?

^

I hope i know what im talking about.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I agree... not sure yet, but my EA sees orders opened manually or by other EA-s...

My idea is to put input variable called master_long and master_short, so for each chart where ea is used you put different master numbers....

for example...  for cable 16384 and 16385,  for eur/usd 12374 and 12375 abd so on....

Is this make any sense?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Interesting!! Make an option of having to do it Semi-manually or automatically.

What do you think my young padawan? LOL

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Ok, i tried it and it works for now....

I also found Symbol() function which can be used to identify on which chart ea is and compare it with pending/opened orders.

But, for now I will use only magic, do not want to complicate it if it doesnt need to be...

First I will do it with manually input magic numbers, semi and auto will be after  we put some force in it..

May the force be with me...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Welldone, Can we have the new version with Magik number?

Pipagic

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Ok, i think magic is not so important because every order gets unique server number but i did put magic in the code for security reasons...

For now, orders opening works, closing  pending orders  also (when ea works only on one chart)...

I got funny results when same ea works on  two charts  at the same time,  some  pending  orders do not close  and  some do not open and red flag warning appears in journal (some stack problem)...

I have tested in 1mnt frame so i think there lies a problem because some ticks  are more than minute away...

Now I am testing it on 15 mnt frame and we shall see...

Easiest way to fix more chart problem is to rename EA for each chart and to change magic number for each also....

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Yes, thats more like it. Ill modify my version later 2day when i get back home.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Does anyone know when a pending order get executed, does a new ticket get new unique number or it get old number from the pending order?

UPDATE:

I forgot, made 10 pips by this method 20mnt ago...

--- 帖子 #122 ---
OK, all in favor of Orange taking a day off from EA coding raise their hands. I think he's loosing it cuz he's mixing up is story lines.

Ok, here is my EA for this strategy...

IT HAS TO BE TESTED ON DEMO FOR SOME TIME BEFORE USING!!!

THIS IS NOT FINAL VERSION!!!

Input parameters:

.

.

.
pips_reserve - number of pips from high/low price of previous day
magic - magic number for using ea on different charts. For each chart assign different number...

Also, for some reason sending order with take_profit less than 6 pips cannot be executed... I am to tired for it now...

So, it should be backtested and if someone is familiar with it, please, send me parameters and some explanation which is the best way to backtest it..

Also, suggestions are highly welcome...

ferovca out....

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You should take some rest while we meddle with this version. Also, those who have experienced in EA, pls do come forward and help us out.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #126 ---
open_long=high_price+(pips_reserve+spread)/10000;

open_short=low_price-(pips_reserve+spread)/10000;

Use Points instead of 10000, or it won't work for JPY pairs.

I will try to code this.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi ferovca,

looks like an EA development contest has begun.

It will keep its ticket number, because it's still the same order.

And a tip for your expert:
Inserted Code    for(cnt=0;cnt<total;cnt++)
{
if(OrderSelect(cnt, SELECT_BY_POS)==True && OrderMagicNumber()==magic && OrderTicket()==ticketL){OrderDelete(ticketL);}
}
<total;cnt++)><total;cnt++)>

When looping through the open positions to close them, it's better to do it "backwards". Because if a position is closed, the remaining will "move up", so you will forget them if the index is incremented. On the other hand, it's easier and safer to simply use your ticket.

Good luck!</total;cnt++)></total;cnt++)>

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Done... thanks...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thanks for the info.... this was the reason I lost 2 hours...  that is why  I have  loop for  each  order...

I will fix it....

I still cannot understand why is not possible to put an order with 5 pips profit from yesterdays high!?  I keep getting message error 130...

anybody...?

</total;cnt++)>

--- 帖子 #130 ---
The backward test result is just soso. You have to use huge stoploss(200 or 300) to make it profit. The weekly filter is very important. I don't have time to test more.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Error 130 means 'invalid stops', so the TP is probably to close.

5 works for me, though (min. 4). Maybe it depends on the broker.

Oh, and here ticketL should be ticketS:
Inserted Code       ticketS=OrderSend(Symbol(),OP_SELLSTOP,lot_size,open_short,slippage,open_short+stop_loss*Point,open_short-take_profit*Point,"Short order",magic,0,Red);
if(ticketL<0)
{
Print("OrderSend failed with error #",GetLastError());
return(0);
}

--- 帖子 #132 ---
yes, 130 is sl/tp problem...

but, moving the sl/tp doesnt solve it... i have to look into the code again..

What should I do to achieve high modelling quality?

And why can I not get testing results for all 4 months (from 01.06. to 01.10.),

last trade is done at 22.06. and then testing stops?

Thanks..

All the 3 Major Pairs get the minimum 5pips. EURUSD gives both S&R

GBPUSD: Resistance 57pips

EURUSD: Resistance 43pips, Support 16pips

AUDUSD: Resistance 46pips

Look at those pips? How can anyone says they cant make pips in forex? Ridicilous, hilarious and piplarious!!

Isnt this fantastic? Simple, effective and we trade every openday!

I cant wait to get the EA done. When it is, I will continue with SRDC Level 2 for more pips.

Make Pips not War

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Good Question! (eyeing on the 600sl?) lol

Set via f8 on the period separator and you will see a vertical dotted line showing the week days ending and starting.

I dunno about other brokers, but on my IBFX platform, between friday & Monday, there will be 2 dotted lines with 2 candles on it. Sometimes the candles are on the lines or inside the lines. It doesnt matter. Get the smallest candle and straddle on the S&R. Chances of hitting both are extremelly high.

I will go over in more details on Monday trading with SRDC on my next next post.

EA programmers, can we incoperate this in our EA when the 1st objective is clear? Traders with SRDC will loooooove monday!!

Welcome to Hapi Pipland!!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi Orange

20-30 pips stop for 5-10 pips target?

Also trade daily charts for 5 to 10 pips?

Do you find these correct?

Regards

howard

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yes it is correct. Because its pipastic.

This may suprise you, increase the SL when you think it will hit earlier.

Tis method is extremelly predictable. I know the ratio thingy. But, that doesnt apply here. It is simply, trading psychology states when S&R are broken, chances of prices to ride along is very high. BUT, there are exception.

Therefore, I think for newbies and big lots traders, it is best to target small pips and increased the chances of winning to over 80%. Remember: The only reason why people lose money in Forex is due to negative pips, but when the pips remain positive, no matter how small, it is still a better chioce. In most methods, pips harvested are not quality pips, here it almost is (this in no way suggest this is a better method or comparing with other method, but its a fact).

Daily Charts? Of course. The margin to harvest 5pips is better than smaller time frames. You might asked why not weekly candles? Well, we dont want to overuse our margin and waited a week to get 5pips do we? Therefore, Daily candles are ideal.

All the above are just my thoughts and experience that help me to be profitable from day 1 (thanks to my prior experience).

I hope that helps. May the force be with you

Pair GBPUSD from 10th Oct to Today. Modelling quality is 90%, 1 lot

I believe, many discredit EA doesnt work is due to wrong coding. Discreationary trading is always better, but most traders couldnt accept, the problems lies not necessarily with EA trading but actually with their coding. So, they abonded the whole idea.

The reason is: Ive met and mingled with successful traders with EA doing trades for them profitably. Its passive income and its real.

I saw the visual of this version and it resembles close to my method. However, lets forward test it and see what happens.

Just a thought: What happens when we grow as old as Yoda? Do we still want to trade or have a good EA to do it for us?

Its sleeping time!!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hey Orange

I demoed your system yesterday and today trading multiple lots. I'm up $4000!!!! I tried this system when I first started to trade a year ago. I thought that I was so brilliant "discovering" this method. I tried it on the 15 minute charts and got pip-jacked!!! I never looked at trading with that method again until  I saw this thread. It makes a lot of sense using the daily candles instead of the lower timeframes. Thanks for the lesson. Now my dream of cursing my staff out and slapping my boss is more of a reality.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Orange,

You did mention that your hardly use an SL. However, have you noticed or came to a conclusion what average SL is needed for the 3 pairs to reach the targeted 10pips? I know most of us here are still not very comfortable trading without SL in place...

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Great job on the EA - thank you.

I tried running it live (on a demo) today and midnight passed with no orders being placed. I am using the first version of the EA (not the one with the adjustable broker day). I'm an experienced MT4 user and everything was et up correctly, EA with smiley face, etc.

This same EA does place orders in the Strategy Tester when I run it for yesterday through today, so I'm baffled at this point. I will continue to look at the code...

Thanks again for your good work,

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Of late i've been doing some re-reading of Tom DeMark's popular book "The New Science of Technical Analysis". In the area of projecting Take Profit targets, Tom has found that aiming for the recent high "Close" (or the recent low's "Close") rather than the recent high "High" (hope that makes sense?) often produces more profitable trades. He calls this area of S/R the "Magnet Price". I have not used this on daily charts, but have regularly traded the use of this S/R "Magnetic Price" off hourly candles. Also, what i've been doing is taking the High MP (mag price) of the last 24 hours with NY 5PM close as the "close" and setting my daily S/R off these areas. I'll do more closer studies/forward tests to see if this will produce good results in this model.

Cheers,

Thom

--- 帖子 #148 ---
"Also, OrangeRoshan, have you tried using the daily candle open/close instead of the high/low for the S/R? Seems like you are leaving pips on the table by waiting for the high/low to be breached."

OrangeRoshan did mention this as a possibility several posts back - the problem is that MT4 (the demo, at least) will not allow a trade to be opened that is not 5-6 pips away from current price. Maybe there's a middle ground somewhere...

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Same here. I used to use a 5mins and 15mins chart, same style however the accuracy is not the same as by using daily chart. Like I said before, 5pips is like 99.9% garanteed. I backtested this method based on daily candle only in sept06, the result :

GBP/USD = 90% of the time 20pips target hit.

EUR/USD = 90% 10pips hit.

Now what is our major target is only 5pips/pair? Thats right...the unswer is 99.9% success.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
LOL, Never Never Never Give UP!

Pipastic!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Yes, of course. I was waiting for someone to ask me this.

GBPUSD is the most volatile of all, 30-50sl should do it

EURUSD is amlost like cable but a bit sober

AUDUSD is really downunder, 25-35sl usually is ok.

However, remember when you are aiming 5pips only, try and trade on Monday & friday (except this friday) to harvest maximum pips. It might help you to recover somelosses just in case the pairs went into extacy and stooped your sl.

May the force be with you

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Nah, at last more help coming. Take a look at skyline's version also and i think it came the closest to the method.

Thanks everyone in advance.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Yes, right on target Doug!

I sometimes use this method when I know market is ranging and candles is simply to long. The thing about S&R sre, when it penetrates it penetrates, but when it doesnt, it usually stay right on the border. Thats why TP is very viable when your entry is from yesterdays open or close.

Lastnyte, a padawan tried this method on GBP which is not ranging YET, his sell orders got triggered at 1.8955. When he uses the support (1.8960), his trade wont get triggered. The price went Superman, up up up!

Still, its worth exploring. For now only when the market is in indecision that Dmark method come useful.

EURUSD: Resistance 5pips

AUDUSD: Resistance 5pips

A total of 15pips

As I type this, the pairs are bullish, up & up like superman... Each pair will pass over 20pips minimum as Dollar is getting weaker. Watch this Friday, Dollar will jump the Grand Canyon!

Pipastic isnt it?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
O,

Tight squeeze on the AUD lasnight. I lost 20p on this one lasnight setting my entry 7 pips from the high instead of 2. How confident are you on 1 or 2 pips from the HL as the entry. Also what are your thoughts on the ASK/BID and the spread for this method. I know you state 1pip+ spread but do you also wait for the ask/bid to clear the HL then 1pip+spread. I appreciate your help.

FJedi

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Lastnyte trade on AUDUSD was around 52pips. I dunno how you lost 20pips unless you have a SL less than 30pips.

Anyway, I use 1-2pips + spread (3pips).

Say Resistance is 0.7701. My Pending Stop Buy is 0.7701 + 2 + 3 = 0.7706

Lastnyte I got the full pips as my TL is 35pips. I made pips while I was sleeping.

Draw trend line and watch the trend direction. When the trend is upwards, which is the case now, and with fundamentals; Dollar weakening and Down under economy is getting stronger, especially with possible Interest Rates hike, AUD is a sure Up Up and away!! I know its near to May High, this friday when dollar's data is weak, expect the croc to rise on the bay.

AUDUSD is a very sober pair, movement is not erotic, just like their crocordiles, friendly bunch!! Traillock of 35 should get you maximum pips or at least a winning trade at the end.

I hope my explaination makes Aussie dollar not only Cents.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
O,

Thanks for all your speedy replys. My last Q. Do you leave your other entry pending till the daily close?

FJedi

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yes and No. It depends on the situations. But, usually I let it ride, even the pips turned negative but I know it will reverse due to the trend, then i will sleep with my trades eventually changes to my favor.

When I wokeup and its still negative I reaccess the trade and might hedge it instead until the trend favors me. Just a word of caution. You need experience and emotionless to do this, otherwise close the trade. Theres always another day. Due to this, risk management is important. Losing trade is norm nothing to fear because you made winning trade more than losing.

5pips at a time, especially when brushing croc teeth!!

Cheerup!!

I dont quiet get your question but i will try to answer it.

The charts we see in our platform solely depends on the Broker's server. With IBFX and Multibank, Dailycandle starts at 6am Brunei Time, 17:00 EST, 22:00 GMT, 09:00 Sydney and 22:00Z UTC.

Its fantastic, after solat, put pending orders, greet the kids & wife, b'fast with them, take a short peek at the charts, then walk slowly to my soft dreamland bed smiling knowing, its another goodday for me.

\n    \n        \n        The clearest Extension Fade is in AUD/CAD.

The clearest Extension Fade is in AUD/CAD. The currency pair has printed a positive candle for 8 trading days now - over the past 10 years, we have only seen 5 periods where the AUD/CAD has strengthened for 8 trading days with only 1 out of those 5 extending beyond 8 days.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

The AUD/USD is also doing a similar thing. The currency pair has rallied for seven straight days. In the past 10 years, there were only 14 times that the move has extended for 7 days, with only 3 of those 14 lasting for longer than 7 days. We credit our technical analyst Jamie Saettele for looking that far back for us. Therefore we are looking to short one of these pairs with the day's high as the stop. AUD/USD is our preferred play because of the lower spread, smaller risk and possibilit of a firm payrolls on Friday. However we do want to point out that AUD/CAD does have a greater statistical significance.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>

Due to a prior engagement, we will NOT be in the office to watch Australian data come out at 7:30pm EST (Retail sales and trade balance). Should the data come out weak, we recommend a short with the today's high as the stop. As soon as we get back to the offices later that evening (probably by 10pm EST), we will send out an update on what we think.

These statistically rare events are hard to pass up.

This is an email from Kathy & Boris, stay alert!!

lurus pulang tu you answered my question

6AM is fine with me. after breakfast you got to sleep back?  no work?

am setting a buy stop and sell stop atm. first attempt using your method  with 5 pips TP only

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Orange,

SL_move_At and SL_move_to are the same meaning as first EA SRDC made by Iya , so when price hit SL_move_AT value then SL will be set to SL_move_to value.

It's strange what you are saying about wrong TP , I have 7 orders closed and all of them are with right TP that i did set. Be sure that value is set correctly on AUDUSD pair.

Anyway i'd like to release SRDC v2.1 , where there is new feature that calculate SL and TP variable based on an interesting indicator TSR Daily Range Calculator that calculates how much should be SL related to Average Daily Range of last 20 days with a fixed Risk_to_Reward_Ratio.

In this way EA automatically will calculate best SL and TP in a dinamycal way instead to be fixed.

So you can find two more variable that have to be set :

* SL_variable : if set to true then SL and TP will be calculated automatically based on TSR indicator otherwise StopLoss snf TakeProfit values will be used as usual.

* Risk_to_Reward_ratio : How much reward we want against risk for a trade. (For example if we want that our trades get a risk:reward = 1:3 we have to set 3)

(to understand how it will be calculated SL and TP I suggest to attach indicator TSR on your daily chart)

Hi everybody,

Forex newbie, here. I'm loading the ea onto the respective charts and by reading the posts I see that the "Start time" paramater is a different for some of you... obviously because of the different MT4 brokers. Im using North Finance for my demo. Can anybody tell me what the "Start time" number should be for North Finance? Also is there an easy way to find out what that number would be, (in general) just in case I decide to try to demo a different broker (FXDD, InterBank FX).

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but the time zone thing confuses me.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #175 ---
ehehe thanks Orange

I notice there's a little bug when calculating SL and TP , so here there is fixed version.

Furthermore i added another variable SL_min that is min SL accepted by our broker (I use NorthFinance and min stop loss have to be 10 pips so i set 10 if i want to use dinamyc SL and TP)

--- 帖子 #176 ---
That was fast!! I dunno wat is IBFX minimum? I guess its zero, since i trade with no sl. So I think I put zero. I hope it works, sometimes it doesnt register any trade.

The Imperial Army is near!!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
hihihihi You're so funny Orange

I can also be able to open a trade without S/L with NorthFinance but if i put a S/L it should have to be no less than 10 pips, so just to be sure that no errors will be given to EA i've set a SL_min to 10 in my forward test demo.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Blame it on Rob Booker & Dave Murphy. They influenced me!!!

Anyway, the EA register trades today all loss!! Guess what, SL for other pairs and Close trade for AUD which happens to bear!!

I have an idea. Can we make the EA smarter by closing the trade on breakeven 1 candle before the new daily candle opens? This way, instead of waiting for the next day and close wateva trade, it actually checks for the time and when its 1hour before closing and its positive, close the trade automatically.

Wat do you think?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Sorry Orange i'm not sure to understand what are you asking for. Could you do an example please ?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Ok.... hehehee...lol

A few hours ago audusd was positive pips, until on the last hour, it started to trend bearish. When in discreationery trading i will exit my trade, and keep the tiny winny profits. But, the EA doesnt know that, so it waited until the last candle of the day and exit with negative pips.

Can we make the EA close the trade when its on the final hour, instead of waiting blindly for the last candle and close the trade?

I think, force the EA to put SL on breakeven or positive pips, minimum 1pip on the last 2hours of the trade when the trend is against the trade.

Now, i think the Imperial Army is far away... LOL

Yes, sori Bro, yes 8pm our time. My mistake.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
mmm ok now i (may be) understand

But isn't supposed that variable SL_move_to and SL_move_at should be works to done what are you asking for ? I mean if your AUDUSD was in positive for let's say 10 pips then if you had set SL_move_to to 10 and SL_move_at to 0 (or to 5 pips) then your trade didn't become a loosing one.

Do I hit your question correctly ?

I use 1hr to enter and exit too. I can draw the high & low of yesterdays using the 1hr chart. This way, I can spot market sturucture and price action in macro.

Ausome, Thanks Orange. I spent almost 11 months on FOREX.com with a demo account trying to learn anything but it was a waste of time. I learnet nothing and at the end I had to close my live account ( Inever got to use but lost more than CAD200 because of currency conversion )

Being on this forum for the past 4 days has taught me much more that what I learnet on my ownin the past 11 months.

I tried the back test and it looks ok, but the EA itself, I dont see it triggered! I download the one done by skyline, but It is still not opening nor closing any positions for me. Thanks for the input

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hey you might be onto something there Orange. There might be an additional reason for the ear-close-to-cranium? Maybe it's in part due to the magetic pull from that Vulcan Mind Meld thingy?

---Hey i'm glad to hear you use the 1hr chart also. Sometimes i come across as a rebel on threads as i like to look at the idea of a big picture from smaller timeframe charts, but i'm really a nice guy (at least my wonderful wife of the past 24 years thinks so. grin) Also, i've gone back to the beggining of spring 2005 on the GbpUsd pair and am forward testing manually looking at the 15m chart just to see the finner retracements and such at the break of the daily H/L to figure out some MM details for myself.

I did a backtest using SRDC method, GBP/USD daily from 1st Sept till 29th Sept. Backtest are done using MT4 Strategy Tester, visual mode, tick by tick. so it's accurate as in real time mode.

All open trades are closed at the end of the day (EOD) regardless of the value, unless of course it reached the TP or SL. The trades which doesn't reached the SL or TP are marked with REVERSE.

The spreadsheet are done with no automatic equations as i'm too lazy LOL so just feel free to modified it if you want to.

You can also used this data as to see whether the EA is working just like doing the trades manually.

cross of what, to the downside of what?

Which version of EA are you using? Can you post your version pls.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Great work!!!

How did you pick the trend?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
sorry if what i post above confuse you guys. It's not the EA. I'm backtesting SRDC method in Sept 2006.

It's easy to manually backtest the method (not EA). just Open te Strategy Tester, and tick the Visual Mode, Model should be Every Tick, use Daily timeframe, and just use any EA (select 0 Lot so that no trades be open), and just click start. Adjust the speed to slow down the movement of price, and pause it to draw lines/indicators. Once again, I'm not testing an EA, but am backtesting SRDC method. sorry if my post is confusing. I was refering that if the EA is working properly, then it should get a result nearly the same with my manually open trade. If it's not getting the same result, but the settings are all the same, then there's something wrong with the EA.

Example of backtesting on 1st Sept 2006 in pics below.

using the EA SRDC v2.1 (skyline), the max trades i can get is only 12, while doing it manually, i get 21 trades as you can see in the spreadsheet i attached above.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Nice work!

I compared your results to those of my EA, and they placed the exact same trades. The only difference was on some 'critical' days, where the profit target gets reached for only 1-2 ticks and price then retraces, the trades sometimes don't get closed. Seems to be Strategy Testers built in 'realism factor'.

Everything else equal, a quick optimisation showed best results with TP=78 and SL=32.

So what about splitting the order to reach different profit targets? Could this  increase overall performance?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Excellent findings. 80% of profit should be taken as T1 and T2 the remaining 20%. Should the trade goes against us, 20% of 32SL wont be so bad. Have options for entering the percentage and the T1 & T2 values. AND no need to include cTp0. LOL

Pipastic

--- 帖子 #235 ---
So if using EA, we use 1hr timeframe?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Yes, they designed it with 1hr candles. You can use daily but changed the parameters.

Pipastic

--- 帖子 #237 ---
kewl.

for the manual backtest, i use Daily, 21 trades.

If EA daily, then only 14 max (don't know about the others). and if using EA 1hr, then i got 21 trades.

Gonna manually backtest all 3 pairs for Aug, Sep, and Oct. If profitable, then gonna use it next week in my live account.

PS: aku kai live with elaun sekolah LOL inda kepisan tu. mudahan tah untung.

Hi,

First thanks to share this with us. I am newbie and of course i have question.

Sorry for my english it's not my mothertongue too

I i have well understand about put "Buy stop" or "Sell Stop" u take the High and Low then you add +1 or +2 and you add again the spreak of the brooker. So we have for example : High 1.2700 then BuyStop is 1.2704.

If i take the cable on 2006.11.02 High is 1.9107 so i bs at 1.9111 but next day bar reach 1.9116 then reverse. But in this reversal case if i put a SL this trade is looser. How i can do for dont enter this trade. Of course if i put TP at 5 pips it's ok. But if i dont do this i lose.

I have see this case many times.

Sorry for my kitchen english... But thanks to help me to understand and win  more than i lose.

The method 99.9% gives winning pips every trading days. So, im just here, backtesting the EA, modified it a little, or wait for more genius to help me create aother version.

In time I will open a new thread for SRDC Level 2 so traders can easily browse and learn more effectively. For new traders, click to review the whole thread and print them for your personal copy. That way, you can bring it anywhere and add new thread as this thread grows.

Any more questions, just use the force, and I will appear!! LOL

Orange, I have a system very much like this, but have not traded it much.  That one had a few additional rules.

The previous day had to have at least 100 pips from high to low (may want to adjust this based on the volitility of the pair).

If the close of the day was within 25 pips of the high or low, don't take the trade. Again, you may want to adjust this a little based on volitility.

Today we had a few pairs opened right at or near the high:

EurUsd  3

EurJpy  5

UsdChf  2

It has the 10-12 TP with a 25-30 SL.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
yes, thats a good suggestion, as i sometimes apply them in a similar way. You may add more of your methods in this thread when it compliment the current system. The reason I didnt mentioned it, becoz I was trying to keep things simple. S&R on daily candle with 5pips target. Any newbie can do it and never have to complain about not making any pips.

Most newbies want to make a 100 pips in a week and expect to become millionaires next month! They try every available method they can get hold off without proper experience and understanding of T.A & Fundamentals that they are using and studied. And many times, newbies get burnt.

Your mentioning of price range is indeed a powerful addition to SRDC, but be warned, when you are still struggling to get used to the basic of SRDC, i suggest, to still keep it basic! Otherwise, grow your knowledge with more experience and make this method your own, eventually.

Hi Orange !

Thirst of all thank you very much for introducing this simple method

I've tried it last night with the following pairs :

EUR/USD, GBP/USD, AUD/USD and USD/CAD

Guess what happened.......

I have an account with oanda and traded one standard lot.

The long orders on EUR, GBP and AUD were all triggered.

The short order for USD/CAD also this morning.

Here are my profits :

USD/CAD : +15 Pips

EUR/USD : +21 Pips

GBP/USD : +28 Pips

AUD/USD : +13 Pips

In summary I made 77 Pips => 770 € during the night !!

I know that this results are not the normal case but its really amazing

By the way I didn't close the trades after 5 Pips but let them run with

a stop loss of 30 Pips.

Do you ever have tested to set the support and resistance lines to

the open and close prices of the candles ?

Is there any remarkable difference in profits ?

My result from testing this is :

"THROW AWAY ALL THIS INDICATORS !!"

"PRICE ACTION ROCKS !!"

Thanks a lot and hoping to read new things soon.....

With kind regards

Bernhard from cologne in germany

By the way I will forward test the method and will start at the beginning of

2007 with 5000 € to trade this method exclusively.

For this I will open a new thread in January 2007.

hi orange here's my first trade using your method.

aud/usd = 10 ,long

eur/usd= 11  , long

usd/cad= 11 , short

it's actually today, but live in malaysia +0800 gmt so i start early around japanese open market for today.

i could let the pips ride higher as the time i'm write this post, it 2240 hrs in malaysia, eur/usd is about 60pips.

but i'm quite a newbie, tend to  be a little bit  jumpy when seeing pips starting to go agaisnt my trade, so rather than wait a little bit i just close my trade.

is it just me  ? this week market seem to be slow ?

Hey, this was very encouraging to me! I'm new to this method and it seems to work well. Congratulations.

Could I contact you by PM or email? I was born in Germany (Ich bin Suedeuropaer und in Stuttgart geboren). I will avoid writing in another language as some people don't understand it. If I could contact you by email, I would love to ask you about the method in the language i was born in: GERMAN!

Thanks in advance. Wish you success.

To OrangeRoshan: I have appreciated you posts back then when the Sidus method started (I vividly remember you post about 500 Pips in one single day with that contest you where running against your trading buddies! Wow....I never got there...into "THE ZONE"....) Do you mind if I go through this method in a step-by-step way? (like an EA for human dummies.... ). Ok, here it goes:

1.) It's midnight (im in Europe GMT+1) the day is over. A new battle...ehm...day is ahead. I draw the horizontal line at the HIGH of the candle (upper wick) and draw a horizontal line at the LOW of the candle (lower wick). Yesterday (now it is Tuesday, Nov 7th,) the GBP/USD had its high at >> 1.9027 and low at >> 1.8946

2.) I enter TWO ORDERS (right? pls correct me where I'm wrong...). Number ONE: BUY STOP at: 1.9027 + 4 Pips Spread + 1 Pip donation to the council  this gives me: 1.9032 as the trigger to enter the trade as a BUY/BULLISH trader).

Number TWO: SELL STOP at: 1.8946 + 4 Pips Spread + 1 Pip for Mr. JarJar to have a Beer, this gives me: 1.8951 where my trade will SELL.

(Here is my first question: is the last statement correct, do i ADD the pips to the LOW figure or subtract??? )

3.) Enter Stop Loss and Take Profits for both Orders (the difficult part of the manual, at least for me): put for both 40-50 Pips Stop Loss and 5 Pips Take Profit (this is the Beginners version, others move the SL to Breakeven and trail the trade to higher highs or lower lows).

4.) Sit and Wait. Or better watch: Star Wars Part 1 - Part 6 and memorize all the terms, so I can come back and understand Forex better.  I suspect that somewhere in the movie I must have missed something as you have been inspired by that movie to be so "pipastic".

Is that it? Just that?

Thanks my friend. Let the "Forex Force" be with you (and me  )

Greetings,

Peter.

PS: Thanks for your generosity but foremost your enthusiasm, which many seem to have lost!

hi,first of all..i dont want any trouble here..esp aginst the roshan the master jedi...hehehe

i just wanna contribute a bit..i think!!n hope so..

we all know-the teqnique using support and resistence from yesterday high and low..rather than we wait the price to break the high or the low..why dont just use correlation currency..eg.GBP/USD VS CHF/USD..GBp/usd with eur/usd

for example..if today.. the GBP/USD already break the yesterday high..and the CHF/USD of is still not breaking the low yesterday(vice versa)so,here our the chance to short for chf/usd(the chf will be breaking low yesterday is high)..it means..more pips..less stop loss..i hope it hepls

thanks

Ok Shah, I read your document 3x and i still didnt get it. You know la, after years of fighting the darkforce, i tend to be a bit slow nowadays... or maybe you were afraid, your boss at the bank might catch you writing this post...

Can u explain again in more details, dear jedi....

i'm not familiar with James16's price action, but i'll be looking at it afterwards. can fibonacci be applied when deciding the TP if using SRDC method?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hey Orange,

Just started testing this method out last night and man I must say what a great system. I did the 3 pairs you suggested in your documention.

eur/usd: +15 pips

gbp/usd: +15 pips

aud/usd: +15 pips

total: +45 pips

I set them with a low t/p to see how it would work. Thanks for this great simple system.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Im glad you are making pips like most of us here. Its a pipastic world with SRDC..

Pipsfully yours,

OrangeRoshan

--- 帖子 #262 ---
ok..let me try to explain it again..as we all know..there is a CORRELATION CURRENCY between GBP/USD n EUR/USD..and this GBP with CHF...if gbp is trend is up..eur will go up also..and chf will be going south..

so,if the high of yesterday is break by gbp..the eur will follow and the chf will be breaking the low of yesterday..isnt it?but mostly the time of breaking will be different most probabaly a gap of a couple minute

for example..on yesterday the chf breaking low yesterday at 4.15 while on that time gbp currency is still not breaking the ysterday high but just near to the high(around 12 pips near the ysterday high)sure enough,the gbp break the high at 4.30..meaning..we have extra pips(arnd 12 pips+5pips)..instead we wait the high(gbp) being break..why just open position(GBP/USD..LONG) during that 4.15(based on breaking low by chf)instead of waiting occur on 4.30..

if still dnt understand.thst my limit of expalination and english..hehe

from jar jar bink..

to be clear what are the exact long / short prices on this example from the 11/7/06 EUR/USD daily candle:

R=1.2817, Buy Stop 1.2822, Sell Limit 1.2827

S=1.2722, Sell Stop 1.2717, Buy Limit 1.2712

My question on the Resistance, the order will not trigger until 2822 therefore after spread = 2825, then limit = 2727 for only 2 pips??

My question on the Support, the order will not trigger until 2717, spread is calculated on the buy, so a buy limit at 2712 becomed 2715 after the spread for only 2 pips again??

How should these orders be entered? I use GFT. Thank you in advance!

Written by John Kicklighter, Currency Analyst

The following is our monthly correlations update for October.  As we have mentioned time and again before, correlations between different currency pairs will inevitably shift over time, therefore it is of utmost importance to keep abreast of these changes.  Below are the one-, three-, six- and twelve-month correlations for the seven major currency pairs.  Additionally, we have included the six-month trailing correlation versus the EURUSD as further confirmation of the correlation.

In order to be an effective trader, it is important to understand how different currency pairs move in relation to each other.  There are a few reasons why this is significant, but most importantly, it allows traders to understand their exposure.  That is, having a portfolio that consists of the EURUSD and GBPUSD is different than having a portfolio comprised of GBPUSD and USDCHF.   As indicated in the tables below, over the past month, the GBPUSD has had a strong positive correlation (+0.89) with the EURUSD and a strong negative correlation with USDCHF (-0.91).  Therefore having a long GBPUSD and long EURUSD exposure would generally lead to negated or nearly zero profit or loss because when the GBPUSD rallies, USDCHF will sell off the majority of the time.  Of course, these two currencies have different pip values and the correlation is not perfect, so the P/L may not be exactly zero. On the other hand, holding long GBPUSD and long USDCHF exposures would be similar to nearly doubling up in one of the pairs since the correlation is so strong.  Furthermore, we can tell from our tables that correlations shift with time.  For example, the NZDUSD has historically held a statitistically weak negative correlation to the USDJPY (-0.28) over the past year.  Just this past month, however, this relationship has developed to more relavant levels (-0.61). Shifts such as these can be partially explained by changes in the severity of monetary policy or changes in unique domestic conditions.  Overall, having this knowledge will allow traders to effectively diversify and manage their portfolios.

Regardless of your trading strategy and whether you are looking to diversify your positions or find alternate pairs to leverage your view, it is very important to keep in mind the correlation between various currency pairs and their shifting trends.

Just remember this:

R:1.0000

Therefore Add spread + 1 to 2 pips. I sometimes even add 5pips. For this example, Spread is 2 and Margin is 2.

Pending buy stop is now: 1.0004. Your orders will be activated when it hits 1.0002 which when you check including spread at your orderbox is 1.0004.

They activate your orders on the actual price but on the order sheet is spread included. I suppose thats why we get -2 as we entered the trade.

When messa think this sounds complicated, do wat my 14yr old son did, just add 10pips on normal majors!! He is now the most loaded selfmade businessboy in his school with starting account of only USD500 last few months. He made an average of 350pips a month on the 3 pairs. Setting pending orders before he goes to school.

Who needs a job (Just Over Broke)?  <---- he said!!

May the pending orders be with you!!

Hi OrangeRoshan,

Thanks for sharing great technic for newbie. I bit late to joint your thread. In your statement you have said carefull if price reach high/low at weekly chart (something like that if i not mistaken).

could u please tell me ...how to identify these proper high/low at weekly chart.

thanks for your help.

I'd like also to thanks our Orange Master Pip-Jedi for sharing his system and help little padawan-newbie to acquire more forex knowledge day after day

I'm enthusiastic about this method. I've written an EA for it that works very well but need some help in developing a good exit strategy. I live in the Chicago area and need to sleep during the Asian/London overlap and this is where many good price moves take place.

Any suggestions will be much appreciated.

Thank you,

Yes, ADR & ATR can help. But the problem with thse things, like fundamental studies, when you interprete and understand it wrongly, the result may be that you can get sucked to the darkside.

Compro99, when you want, you may add your AR studies here and everyone can benefit and apply whereever possible.

Mesa think good!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Open a weekly or daily chart. Zoom out as much as you can and draw the High and lows of previous candles. This way you know when yesterday's and todays H&L are near...

Mesa think ez...

The blockade is finish, i dare not go against this jedi....

Anyway, excellent suggestion. There are many ways around this. One could be:

Taking profits as T1, T2, T3

T1 == x%, T2 == y% and T3 == Final take profits. Sl will be moved, to T1 when T2 is reached and so on. Defensive Trading.

We must accelerate our plans, get the landing troops....

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Orange, thank you for your answer, this is very helpful. So, a couple more questions for me to understand:
"Im not clear why you use Sell/buy limit ..... R:1.0000 .... Spread is 2 and Margin is 2. Pending buy stop is now: 1.0004. Your orders will be activated when it hits 1.0002 which when you check including spread at your orderbox is 1.0004."

Regarding the 5 pip method only: after the Buy order is placed for 1.0002 which equals 1.0004 with spread, do I place a contingent Sell (not limit) at 1.0009? Also, congratulations on your son's progress. A great Bible quote "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth." Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I just want to say thanks to Orange for this.

Also to Skyline for the EA. I have just started to test it.

A few questions and points:

1) for any one looking in to this look at MATAF for some info on daily movement.

2) Skyline, are you able to add two ideas to your EA?

i) A Magic number

ii) A weekly calendar so you can add extra lots on Mondays opening after the short weekend candle.

3) Has any one looked at the optimal settings for the EA's for each currency? for TP and SL etc.

Thanks

Hi,

Dear orange roshan

It seems that method is very simple and interesting but I have a question

how we should draw trend line?from where to where?

I`m a newbie in forex and maybe my question to be very simple

excuse me about that

Regards

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi OrangeRoshan Kenobi, Great idea, I tried the method with 5 pairs (added USD/CHF and USD/JPY) 5 for 5 successful trades.

Looks like we can adjust the # of pips to the currency pait, 5 works for all, good base for AUD/USD, 8-9 for USD/JPY, USD/CHF & EUR/USD and 10-12 for GBP/USD. This thought is based on average daily volatility.

Thanks for an approach worth persuing.

BTW did you play with Abdul Tatlomi, using the Alligator as a filter to avoid whipsaw? From what I have seen it is an effective filter.

Happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
3) Watch the monthly / weekly highs and lows. I would avoid a trade when it is near to the H&L. Price might reverse against your favour before it hits your takeprofit.

OrangeRoshan ... can you explain on this.. you write this on your documentation about the method..

Thanks...

--- 帖子 #282 ---

Hi,

I am a little confused about the timing of placing trades using this SRDC method.

To trade the following pairs can someone please tell me the ideal GMT time to place the trades for each pair?

GBPUSD

EURUSD

AUSUSD

USACAD

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hello Orange,

I used this indicator (FiboPiv_v2) instead of H/L for S/R and it gives me the a very similar entry trigger. If this is a feasible alternative? If yes, then I can save it into a template and just added to each pair. What do you think?

How would I attach the indicator in case that others want to experiment with it?

Thank You

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Good start for me. Manage to get 24pips fr EUR/USD on my 1st day of trade with ur SRDC method. Hopefully it will stay that way in the coming days.

Thanks for sharing the idea Orange.

Stonie,

So I can place a trade on all 4 pairs at the same time?

I though that each pair had a different end of day time.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
So far i only notice EUR/USD & GBP/USD at 6am (SG Time). Not sure of the other 2. Will take note of the other 2 in the future.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
The Chinese announcement caused all the pairs to move at the same time. News like that will override any normal timing,

--- 帖子 #293 ---
just to clear things up. the time daily depends on what time your broker use. for example, Interbankfx use GMT for their server. but it may be different for other broker. you can asked your broker regarding the timezone.

[quote=Narc]sorry if what i post above confuse you guys. It's not the EA. I'm backtesting SRDC method in Sept 2006.

It's easy to manually backtest the method (not EA). just Open te Strategy Tester, and tick the Visual Mode, Model should be Every Tick, use Daily timeframe, and just use any EA (select 0 Lot so that no trades be open), and just click start. Adjust the speed to slow down the movement of price, and pause it to draw lines/indicators. Once again, I'm not testing an EA, but am backtesting SRDC method. sorry if my post is confusing. I was refering that if the EA is working properly, then it should get a result nearly the same with my manually open trade. If it's not getting the same result, but the settings are all the same, then there's something wrong with the EA.

Thanks Narc. I did not know about this. Very interesting and usefull. Sure does chew up a lot of CP time though.

Have a great day

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I just manually tested this system on EUR/USD for the last 27 trading days- excluding NFP days.

I left out the NFP days due to the possibility of not getting filled, huge spreads and stops not being honored.

I assumed a 2 pip spread, a 5 pip TP and a 20 pip SL.

25 winning days @ 5 pips = + 125

3 losing days @ 20 pips= - 60

(one day had both a long and short winner)

Total= +65

That is an average profit of 2.3 pips per trade.

Admittedly. this is a small sample, but that is too small a margin for me to want to trade this system.

I doubt that in actual practice there would have been any profit at all. I didn't (and couldn't) take into account increased spreads and non-fills on news days other than NFP.

With a 20 pip SL, going for any more than a 5 pip TP would have resulted in worse results.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi All,

Can anyone send me an email or post link on back history (2004, 2005 to current) of the EURJPY. I am backtesting EA. I am very interesting in this Orange method. Looks promising.

What are the correct settings and the time frame for SRDC EA.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I started testing this system Tuesday and so far I have 9 wining trades to end the week. I have no losing trades as of yet and I'm only going for the min. t/p which is 5 pips, but I did do just one with 10 pips and was able to get.

11/7/06

eur/usd: buystop @1.2736 t/p @1.2741 hit target= +5 pips

aud/usd: buystop @ .7725 t/p @ .7730 hit target = +5 pips

gbp/usd: buystop @ 1.9033 t/p @1.9038 hit target = +5 pips

11/8/06

aud/usd: sellstop @.7695 t/p @.7685 hit target = +10 pips

no trades for gbp and eur.

11/9/06

gbp/usd: sellstop @1.9003 t/p @ 1.8998 hit target = +5 pips

aud/usd: sellstop @ .7676 t/p @ .7668 hit target = +5 pips

eur/usd: buystop @ 1.2810 t/p @ 1.2815 hit target = +5 pips

11/10/06

gbp/usd: buystop @ 1.90.90 t/p @ 1.9095 hit target = +5 pips

eur/usd: buystop @ 1.2851 t/p @ 1.2856 hit target = +5 pips

no trade for aud/usd

week total : 50 pips

I could've racked in more, but Im just sticking with the 5 pips min. for now. I made do more later as I feel more comfortable.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
is there any reason why you don't take some trades on 8th and 10th nov?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Only reason was because neither my buystop or sellstop was activated thats all.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Ziggy, the system says that a limit buy and/or sell order should be placed. Is this what you are doing or are you waiting until the price is either close to the S or R before you decide whether to limit buy or sell.

Mark

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Ok, Trendline drawing is an art. There are many ways around it, and there is not 1 correct way, but beware, there are also many wrong ways.

In SRDC particularly, I drew (as the name apply) Support & resistance trendlines, which created a channel (parallel trendlines). This way, i can find out whether the pair will change trend (when it penetrate the trendline) and to see what the range of the pair (by calculating the channel distance) and to see where is the most probable price movement of the next candle (by dividing the channel into 2; the mid trend line).

Study this H1 EURUSD chart and May the force be with you!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Yes, I applied a lot of filters to the previous system and eventually I settle with a more simple ones and married it with SRDC = Tiga Abdul SRDC Breakout method.

Messa less dizzy now...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
When the price is near to daily or weekly highs or lows. The price usually bounce erotically before 2 things happen: 1) penetrate, 2) Not penetrate.

This usually hit your stoploss even when the trend is in your favour EVENTUALLY. Explaination: Traders sentiment. So, beware, when in doubt, go call your cat, & spend the evening stroking HER. Just dont trade that day!

Meowwwwwww........... scratch, i will!!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I have been using a Limit+ TTO order. Ie: You place an order with a limit entry, it also place a SL and a TP order ( you set the levels). If either the SL or TP are activated the other side is closed.

Been working OK for about two weeks.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks for that bapxyz, that is what I have been doing, but what do you consider when deciding to either place a sell or a buy limit order - clossness to either S and R??(or do you place both)? I may be missing something here so please forgive me if I have.

Of course, SRDC is a basic form. You can modified it as it may fit. Save it on the template and attach the save template on your post.

On metatrade a buy limit is for price reversal while a buy stop is when the price penatrates and keep going. I place my stops when the price is near on either side.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I need to get the trend line drawing down, but learn I will.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
At the end of the daily bar are you placing orders to go long and short?  For example based on you analysis if the trend is in the up postions are you still placing orders on both sides of the candle or just placing an order to go long?  Hope this makes sense.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Can you point to where we might find those indicators versions you are using so we can experement with them?

Njfx,

The fractal is an indicator provided by the MT4 on my server and probably yours. The other two I downloaded from this forum. Sorry, but I don't know how to put them on this post. Maybe someone else can show me how. You can do a forum search and you should be able to find the posts where you can download them yourself. Hope this helps

Thanks

--- 帖子 #320 ---
OrangeRoshan,

I'm just beginning reading this thread, but I'm wondering how the above method is working for you. Do you really set take profit of 5 and stop loss of -25? Surely you will get a stop loss every now and then, and you would have to have 6 wins to every one loss to make any real pips.  Are you indeed getting these?

Just so I understand, you place a limit order to go long at resistance (top of the closed candle) and you place your take profit at + 5 + spread + 1.

You also place a limit order to go short at support (bottom of closed candle) and you place your take profit at +5 + 1.

Is this all correct?

Thank you.

Mike

OrangeR,

Please clarify something for me..... I use MBtrading for my entries and what I using the SRDC method by putting STOP/TTO both ways. Basically it will get me in Long or short when it hits my price in addition in includes an upper trigger/lower trigger that serve as Take profits and Stop Losses. So it is like a straddle. Does this conform to the OrangeRoshan's SRDC Method?

Thank You

--- 帖子 #323 ---
No, I have not tried it, but I backtested it and had 2 losers in 10 winners, with stop loss at 35 that makes me down $35.00. I will backtest further though.

With Oanda we only have "market orders" and "limit orders". A market order fills you immediately at the present price, a limit order enters when price reaches your input price. I assume we use limit orders.

Thanks again OrangeRoshan.

--- 帖子 #324 ---

Firstly i will put take profit at 5 pips, so if i have to go anywhere, at least 90% chances that it will hit my 5 pips TP. If i'm in front of my pc, i will close the position manually.

I put the stop loss about -35 pips. Once my position over +10 (if i'm in front of my pc) i'll change the stop loss to +1 pip.

eur/usd buy stop @ 1.2854 t/p @ 1.2859 target hit = +5 pips

eur/usd sell stop @ 1.2840 t/p @ 1.2825 closed it at 1.2830 = +10 pips

price of course went lower but 10 pips was okay for me.

gbp/usd buy stop @ 1.9124 t/p @ 1.9129 target hit = +5 pips

gbp/usd sell stop @ 1.9106 t/p @ 1.9096 target hit = +10 pips

aud/usd buy stop @ .7674 t/p @ .7679 target not hit

closed price @ .7655 = -19 pips ( I was sleep when this happened)

aud/usd sell stop @ .7652 t/p @ .7647 target hit = +5 pips

Today's Total = +16 pips

Even though I had 1 losing trade I still I had a good trading day. I could have killed that trade earlier, but decide to ride it out. Once it got near my sell stop I killed the buy and let the sell take over. I could've let the aud/usd sell trade ride longer but I was kicked out before I decided to increase my t/p.

Orange, hey man thanks again for this simple system.

Hey,

Looking at your numbers they aren't even close to where my candles are on IBFX. Are you able to post charts.

Hey there,

At the risk of boring the life out of you, what day and date are we looking at? I use IBFX as you do and the candles look completely different.

Cheers

I think when you try looking at current H1 chart, I have a feeling it will look very similar, maybe 97% similar. When it still doesnt look similar, try candles or zooming in or out. when it still doesnt, then Sir Bob Geldof must have change the lyrics hence the musical note.

Orange and the gang

What is the reason for using candlesticks? Could we use bars or lines? Also it seems to me that using lines charts makes it easier to draw trends. Has anyone try it?

Hi 4rex,

Of course you can use anything you like, as long as you feel comfortable and you can reach to your objective. Y I use it? Hmmmm.... let me think. My native language is not english. when I was born, my parents speak Bahasa Brunei to me, and because of that, Im comfortable communicating using that language. But, since english is our Universal language (even alien speaks it, when you dont believe me, watch all the movies), I learn it at school and it becomes my 2nd language.

Based on all this, I think its the same, why I use candlestick instead of OHLC or Renko or 3line break or whateva messa use now. To me, its a matter of preferance, and majority of people using it (easier communication), and it tell a bit more information by a single glance compared to others (of course this is my opinion).

Explain, I have...

Thank you for your feedback. English is not my native language either. I was born in Cuba but I have lived in the U.S for many years so I am caught between two world culturally and otherwise. I like many others appreciate your efforts and contribution.  I add this image in your honor:

Has a usable EA been developed and, if so, is it available?

I think you have a great strategy and would love to be able to try it out on a MQL4 platform.

I'm now running something similar on a TradeStation platform written in Easy Language, but I know nothing about MQL4.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Greetings all,

I have read through all the posts now, and have to say that I am very unimpressed with this system, and am writing to warn people who are trading it live to be careful. I believe it is doomed to fail, to take your money, if traded without discretion, fundamentals, trend lines, etc. etc.

For instance, Orange has stated that stop losses for the cable should be up to 50 (30-50). If we are taking 5 pips profit then we have to have 10 winners for every 1 loser. In backtesting, this did not happen. I think this is the reason for all the EA's being developed, changed, tweaked, revamped, etc.

I am not saying this system cannot be traded successfully, but I am saying that Orange has been trading many years and depends upon much of his experience regarding fundamental analysis, trend line drawing (which he has not explained to us thoroughly) and even fibs and support resistance, and even moving averages (if you read through all the posts you will see that he uses all these indicators and methods).

The system will NOT work as OrangeRoshan describes it in one post, to just enter your orders and stop losses, go to bed and wake up with a fat account. Orange, I believe there is danger in this type of trading, and you need to warn people not to trade like this, as eventually the mathematics of this system will make us unprofitable. Simply 2 losses in a row with cable will require us to win 20.

So, if you are like OrangeRoshan, and able to put on moving average indicators, draw trend lines the way they should be drawn, filter in fundamental analysys before, during and after trades, only trade on Mondays and Fridays (except certain Fridays of course) and employ a healthy "gut level feeling" based upon years of experience, then this system may work for you.

However, I would surely not recommend simply putting in orders, with stop losses, and expecting your account to grow. This system is dangerous!

It hurts me to see people post things like, "OrangeRoshan, I tried your system last night and am up _____ pips. Wow, it's great!" The reason this hurts is because if they continue their 50 pip stop loss will eventually get hit, and possibly more than once. This system should be tested over months and/or years, and the results posted for all to see, not merely a one-time trade (or one week even).

I'm sure I will get some flames for this post, but my honest desire is simply to warn people not to part with their hard earned cash over a system that is mathmatically unsound and doomed to fail over the long run, unless you can employ fundamental analysys, trend lines, moving averages, fib levels, support resistance lines, weekly and monthly high lows, etc. and all the other indicators and price action and systems that OrangeRoshan uses for his many years of experience in trading.

OrangeRoshan, I thank you for making this system, at least your beginning post, simple. However, I think you are hyping this up and getting people excited about a system that people should be warned AGAINST instead.

This is just my opionion, thank you for reading.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Do any of the EA's just do the basics. Enter pending orders at the daily High and low with a stop loss and a profit target? I would like to try it. But, I do appreciate your info.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ok ok I agree. To all Padawans pls stop using this system as you have been warned by another trader who cares a lot about you more than I do.

and, all of you should listen to him, as he has more experienced and very very successful compared to me. Especially in win/loss ratio, trading psychology and of course my sharing style.

I apologise to everyone, as mikejody correctly pointed out to the jedi council, that I should have throw my 14yrs experience and tons of indicators in a single document so that everyone will be confused, opps sorry i mean informed. SRDC level 2 , 3 & 4 should have been taught immediatelly.

An I also apologise, for letting you guys take 5pips only.... ehhh... now hangon, I didnt teach that, I said, Get 5pips as a newbie until you understand the system more....then you can ride the profits. I think I mentioed that numerous time. Also use a demo account until you are ready and confident.

and i also strongly advise everyone to PM mikejody to seek the right trading method, as he is prepared to share it with everyone since he seems to know everything and right about me and all the padawans.

and, mikejody will also help newbies, and teach 100% in 1 document, not step by step on how to trade successfully like he does.

Please stop using this method, and switch to mikejody's method as his trading style will not hurt anyone and when he lose a trade it will be very easy to recover back. Must be an excellent strategy.

I also deeply feeling very remorsed about traders who has make pips. The truth, they were false pips, manufactured underground by me and my cousin.

as a final note, I deeply regret when anyone that uses my method and lose a lot of money or worst bankcrupt and have to sell their wedding ring just so that you can eat again. I will returned all you tution fees.... HANG ON, I never charged anyone! Forget about the returned money.... LOL

Mike, pls read all the posts again.

Confused, i am...

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Pls asked mikejody first as i may endup bankcrupting you. He will guide you fm now on..

May the force be with you.

OrangeRoshan,

I am not saying your system won't work, I am saying it won't work as it is being hyped. "Simply enter your orders, set your stop losses, and wake up to a fat account." That is misleading. A risk/reward sytem of 2000/1 will work, and it will work often, but it will fail in the long run.

If this system is indeed successful then obviously it will continue for hundreds and hundreds of pages, as everybody learns that all you have to do is risk 50 pips and you'll make 5 every time, and you've found the holy grail. Foolish!

It would be nice if you could examine my points below, and not attack me just because I pointed out real flaws in your system.

Your post below smacks of sarcasm, so I won't respond to any more of it. I just want people to be much more careful than you are leading them on to be.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Or you could ask OrangeRoshan, but just understand that it does not work as he is stating here. You do not simply enter orders, set your stop loss, and wake up with a fat account.

Part of becoming successful in forex is not only risking some to make some but also not giving back what you have made. OrangeRoshan's hype is misleading.

If I am wrong, and Orangeroshan can provide accurate results for several months of risking 50 to get 5, then we should all jump on board immediately, for he has become smarter than any other trader in the history of Forex.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Now, since you are kind enough to save everyone thru your judgement of me, my question is, after critising, "WILL YOU GO FURTHER TO HELP THEM THE RIGHT WAY?" or you just critise and leave the newbies to ponder that they are wasting their time?

C'mon, help them all the way.... will you?

Show me your method and trading style and help everyone here, dont just bash and leave!! be responsible Mike!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
OrangeRoshan,

Why do you take my desire to warn people away from a poor risk/reward system as arrogance? Is that your defense? It is much like this:

Mike: "Friends, stay away from hot fires, you may get burned."

Orange: "Mike is so arrogant!"

Not a good defense, OrangeRoshan.

You ask me to give them something in return, but I tell you that my posts of warning against an unsound system stand on their own. It will be enough service to people if they are warned not to trade as you have recommended in previous posts, "set your orders, and stop losses, go to bed and wake up with a fat account."

I am a newbie trader, having traded for only 3 years previously on a demo and now 2 months live. I have made 23% on my account in the previous 2 months, and have the stats to show it, but requesting this is merely a diverson. The subject is the unsound method of trading that you are recommending.

The fact is, it does not matter if I have traded for 1 week or 22 years. What matters is the credibility of the trading system you are presenting.

Please, rather than attacking me, I would ask you to present some of the statistics that prove your manner of trading (risking 50 to make 5) has been successful. If it is, I will rejoice with you. If not, then I suggest you change some of your posts that are so misleading!

Here are the stats of the method I have been demo trading and live trading. If anyone would like the system itself please let me know through PM and I will consider giving it to you (though not if you are connected with OrangeRoshan as he is interested in only slamming me and putting me down, not in examining objectively).

Jedi sense a dark force!!

OrangeRoshan's SRDC method so far works for me. Earn 45 pips yesterday  base on EUR/USD & GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
A "dark force" that wants people not to lose their money? Hmmm...maybe your charges is not accurate.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
And I do apologize, OrangeRoshan, if my method of presenting my thoughts to you was "without any tact", or was rude or harsh in any way. I do not mean to be that way. My only desire was to try to get some "balance" to this thread so that people do not merely set orders and hope to wake up with a fat account.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Orange

Heck of a good thread and I have made a few pips with it alone. But I have found ways to incorporate the previous days h&L in some other trading methods I am using and had not thought to use the previous H$L data.

We should all be big boys and girls here and understand we are going against the generaly accepted money management plans and accept the risk.

So that said thanks for the warning Mike I think you mean well but can we get back to the thread and bring harmony to our universe.

MTFBWY

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Mike it will be great if you could start another thread , showing your trading style/method/system so that other people here could learn from what you learned in 3 years of trading.

ForexFactory is greatest forum because there's a lot of people that try to help each other to find right way to became a trader and this is what Orange try to do here , only help other

I don't want to start a flame with you, I'm sure that your intent is fine and you want only to advise newbie-traders to be careful but Orange said a lot of time to test in demo to practise and then try to trade live.

Reading your posts it seems that you reading only what you want to read and not the whole posts about this simple (and effective) method.

Yes SRDC method it's not the holy grail, we all know this, there will be losing trade and we have to live with some loss but with proper money management and understanding it could be a little step to learn something new and improve our trading skill. Don't you agree?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Guys theres no need to fight over this. If people are just doing a demo and forward testing this method, you will find out how good it is or how bad it is, by just taking the 5 pip take profit. People still have to make the decision on going with a large stop lose or small stop loss. Practice and learn. I haven't found one system thats perfect and I don't expect to, but this system have given me short but steady pips and thats find by me. Orange you stated earlier that you will introduce level 2 of this system after we tried this for awhile, so I will wait and see what the next level is.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Thanks skyline.

Mike, pls look at the previous few pages, i talk a lot about teaching taking more than 5pips. and on my early posts, i taught about moving stoploss and even show the pips i made where i could get more than 80+ pips but my SL was hit after 50+pips.

Read all the posts and i guarantee you, your warnings are not necessary.

I was like you once, knowing something and strongly disagree based on something i didnt understand and reserached fully. It died out, as i found out many great things that i have missed.

I welcome critics but pls do it in a manner in  line with this thread, that is humourous and friendly. But, when you must, email me or PM me.

Thats it for now. jedi council re-adjourned.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
That certainly is possible, I certainly may be mistaken here and I don't claim to know it all whatsoever.

OK I sure will, and sorry again if my statements seemed rude or harsh.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Apologies accepted.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
No one system or method is 100%. I think we should all be 100% focused on the positive and continue together to improve what has been offered to us by "Orange". If we as traders were all consumed with losses we would freeze and do nothing which ulimately will get us nowhere. A solid simple method combined with smart money management is key.

Enough of my rambling and lets get on with the job of holy grail hunting!!!

Hi folks !

I'm wondering whats going on here

All the people who doubt about Orange's "new" idea about trading

the markets should think back to the times where no PC exists...

No EA's, MA's and happy clappy stuff...

Only the raw meat was presented to us.

Thank god for the invention of the fax machine and phone

Orange probably knows what I want to express

We are all human beings who are able to make a decision whether to

walk to the left or right side of life.

So let FF be what it is :

A buffet where everyone could take the peaces he wants to eat and digest !!

Let's go back to the naked way of trading with a minimum of tools !!

Orange if I can I will support your way of thinking !!

I know that you're a special guy here at FF and that you're not

throwing crap into the ring

So I apologize that you carry on sharing your wisdom with us....

May the pips fill the right pockets !!

Happy Pippin !!

To all,

Boy, the sabers are lighting up the sky like streams of radiant energy....   Those of us that have been experimenting with SRDC welcome all opinions but Mike you went beyond warning us of the perils of using this method by questioning Orange's intent and character and THAT my friend does not belong here. Orange your sarcasm did not help the situation and perhaps a better approach would have been to stick with your point that he was judging/evaluating the method without reading/interpreting its full and complete content and ignore the rest.  It was only a matter of time before many of us who can think for ourselves responded to Mike's comments.  I and many others are thankful for your contributions and look forward to the SRDC sequel.  Mike I also want to thank you for adding a dose of caution.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks. It was a case of misunderstanding.

May the pips with everyone!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
yes, I agree, I was very sarcastic. I cant help it, sorry, LOL. One thing that i learned over the years, excitement bring more joy than fear. Thats why, i hated negativity. we worked so hard to make this thread a very happy one. Any big criticism can be channeled via email or PM. But one must first study the whole thread before passing critisism. But, a happy constructive critism may be channel straight as any normal post.

fear will cloud judgement, and will lead to the darkside. Btw, its 8:31am here and i havent sleep yet.... mrning everyone, may the force be with everyone 2day....

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Yes.. i see this method is profitable... please continue it ...

Will you be placing trades based on previos candles today? The ranges from the previous 24 hours are quite wide

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Orange i want to thank you giving a system perfect for an idea i have been posting about on FF (5 or 10 pips a trade), sadly all the naysayers started booing my thoughts, this has really gave me better hope and i am looking forward for you to post SRDC 2, 3 and 4!, Btw english is not my first lang. either so i truely appreciate your effort in posting all these posts,so ROCK ON ORANGE!

That was just a critic from another sith/jedi council. I was 2 days of profitable trade using SRDC jedi system (not only 5 pips but more than 70 pips).

Thanks master.

I really appreciate your teaching.

P/S In post #338, you mention about SRDC level 2,   Can't wait for that level coming

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Look at the chart i attach. It is my observation only and not a guarantee. However, my observation proves usually to be quiet a good one. Lets hope it is true for this one.

p/s what you see is an intro to SRDC level 2

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hey there,

This looks like a bull flag so what your suggesting is that price has broken out of the flag or channel and is now testing the top of the channel before moving higher. So combined with your method we look for the price to break the resistance on a daily candle.

Do you trade the basic method everyday? Sometimes price can surge then consolidate for a few days which would be a no trade.

Regards

Alex

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yes and NO

Basic method is SRDC level 1. This method has been perfected with different levels. Yes, it is my method of trading. No, its not the full system. What i illustrate is basic coming to level 2.

We dont have to trade everyday. When there is no trade, then no trade. But remember, as you become familiar with the method, a no trade 2day, means a bigger pips the next day as the candle will be much longer than the previous.

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Lets be nice to the volunteer ea developer in this thread. Give them some encouragement. Stay optimistic.

Hope that pips!

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thank you.

The Level 2 will be on a new thread titled,"OrangeRoshan's SRDC method Level 2". The reason is to make learning less confusing. New comer can goto Level 1 1st before going to level 2 thread.

Jedi council will announce in the up coming meeting...

Hey,

thanks for the insite, very helpful.

alex,

Here are some correction after all. Howard make an announcement that AUD economy may not be doing very well as expected. It has created a stronger Dollar (USD). A short trade may look promosing. Study the chart.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
OrangeRoshan, i'm looking foward to the level 2

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I have attached an indicator (see below) that will help those who wish to manually backtest/forward test this method. The green/red dotted lines are the high/low of the previous day (based on your server time). The silver lines are Fibonacci levels above and below the high and low, added just for fun. The indicator will work on any timeframe but 1 hour is best for quick research.

May the Schwartz be with you...

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Why don't we add another 10 or 15 pips to the High (and Low) of the previous candlestick before we pull the trigger just to get an additional confirmation for a substantial breakout? So far I've already noticed two candlesticks in Oktober with false breakouts.

I wouldn't use a S/L higher than 20 pips. That's a R/R ration of 4/1 and that should be more than enough.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Looking forward to level two.

Yesterday was a trying day on this thread for you, I am sure. So I thought you might like to see my Starship I use to chase pips. The market maker ships. (read Dark Side).

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Excellent indicator. Do you have anything that draws trendlines or channels?

Force is stronger now..

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I myself use a minimum of Spread+5pips as my margin.

Look at the channel drawn on my previous posts. TP and SL can easily be iddentified. Regarding Win and loss ratio; Many traders will prefer a higher TP compared to SL, due to the ratio of course. This is indeed correct, but, different methods and experiences can change that ratio based on 2 things:

1. Number of winning trades - I know renowned traders who had more losses than wins, but still profitable. How? simply, their Tp is far higher than their SL. In short, tight SL.

2. How the method operates - In SRDC, winning is far more frequent than losing, but with a big stop loss. In the early part of this thread, it seems the TP/SL ratio is not rational. As most traders realised, by using trendlines or channels, Tp & SL is clearly visible. Depending on where the candles are, TP and SL is almost 1:1.

With more frequent wins than loss, where will you be next summer?

Dooo doooo doooo dooooo, here comes the sun... its alright...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
LOL.... Jedi are still looking for the right planet for the 2nd settlement of R2D2, opppsss i mean SRDC.

Anyway, practice trend drawings, as Level 2 demands a lot of it.

p/s Is that your dog?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
O,

What is this level 2 you speak of? Also I like the results im getting from SRDC with only one small change. Im thinking about expanding this method to other pairs.

FJ

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Level 2 requires trendlines and the use of MA. It will be on a new thread soon. Im away fm my usual trading room, actually in Malaysia now. Will probably launch it after my Pisa trip.

But before that, I need help from everyone to comment on the current EAs we have for ez integration into L2. Modification & bugs within the confiment of SRDC of course.

regarding other pairs, of course you may use it, especially when you know those pairs very well. Price Range and Analysis studies will be Impeccable.

Change it as you see fit and make it your own.

How are the Fibonacci levels (above and below the high and low) calculated?

Just 21 & 34 pips each way for now - maybe I'll add 55 later if I have time.

Nothing like the ones you have posted - yours look like Andrews Pitchfork (are they?) and I have never seen an indicator that will draw it. If anyone has such an indicator, let us all see it.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi all,

Here are the new channel for AUDUSD. The new channel is derived from the candles not following the rules of coming back to the mid trend, hence a possibility of a new range downward trend.

This new channel will be useful only when the candles remain in the channel most of the time. When the candles agree with the channel, im afraid, its no trade for SRDC L1 with AUD today. The reason is the range is too small for a profitable break on S&R. But when it breaks, L2,3 will definitelly catch it!

Hope The Duck wont attack Howard.. <== where is that coming fm?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Only was in for 2 pair this am but good for 28 pips.

OrangeRoshan, i've never draw a channel or such. so am wondering, you're using Andrews' Pitchfork?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
No, Im afraid not. Im using Equidistant Channel and a simple trendline to draw the mid channel. Messa sense, many newbies will be confuse when drawing the channel. Hope we can find an indicator that will do it automatically.

hi OrangeRoshan,

its about channel, at what timeframe actually should we draw it.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
The SRDC indicator posted below will allow the user to modify the period end time and thus adjust for different time zones. Default is 23 meaning "use the close of the bar at hour 23:00 as end of day". This will default to your server time. Sounds confusing but isn't - just set the StartTime variable to the hour preceding when you would like the day to end on your chart.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Sorry, make that the hour you want the new day to start...don't forget, there is no 24 - midnight is zero

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Yes, Its perfect!! Its amazing wat we can achieve when everybody help each other. You just help to excel the learning curve of many newbies.

Pipastic!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Use the strato Indicator, That should solve your problem.

Many pips fall upon you

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Try and use candles, easier for most (i hope, certainly for me).

Use the strato indicator.

L-Levels in SRDC

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Orange,

So how do we use the Strato for SRDC or do we have to wait for the sequel?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Lou,

Thank you for sharing the updated version. I have one question....I changed the default to 17 (my new candle starts at 5pm est in the US) but is not showing on my chart. Is this because it will not show until 5pm today?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Not sure I understand the question. At what time EST do you want the prices to change? Your MT4 server is on GMT+2 (7 hours ahead of you) so adjust accordingly. OrangeRoshan indicated in an earlier post that he didn't feel time zone changes made much difference in the functioning of his method but if you really want to make midnight happen at another time, change the StartTime variable relative to your server.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Attached is the latest (and final) SRDC indicator.

Default StartTime set to zero (best for most users). New day will start when your server says it does! If it ain't broke, don't fix it...

Additional fib line added at 55 pips above/below. Some days do get to this level - look and see.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
If you will send some EURUSD charts to my email with your trend lines drawn, I will attempt to code an indicator. Please make them good resolution (600x600 or better) - the ones you have posted are very small and hard to read. Enjoy your travels...

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I think that SHI_Channel could be really usefull to improve SRDC method but I found out that it changes slope so many times in one days , so it became useless to identify a trend. Any suggest on how to correct it or if there is a new version that don't change slope a lot of time in a day?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Yes thats true, but what happens when it is a reversal?

Level 2 has a method of entering early, safer. Nethertheless, yes you can do that too... when it work 4u.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Correctly spot. anyone knows know how to make it static?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
It really does rake in the pips.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Look at 11/10 and 11/15. Wat would you do?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
As you can see, few if any false entries.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Not sure what you mean by reversal.

Can't the same thing happen to you entering at the high/low?

What is the Level 2 you mentioned?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
What pair are you referring to?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I remember one Padawan did that and was also profitable. Its worth looking into... ill ask him....

--- 帖子 #426 ---
If the daily candle is green, then you look for a long entry and you take the first entry because that may be the only one that pays.

If the daily candle is red then you look for a short entry and you take the first entry because that may be the only one that pays.

You can look at the 60 minute chart to see the momentum building.

And you can use the top/bottom prices to trade the news.

That's how I rake in the pips.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hey,

So would you straddle the close price of previous daily candle with a buy and sell say 5 pips from close price?

Alex

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Found an end-of-day bug in the previous version - this one should be good.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
That's not how I do it.

If the daily candle is green, you go long.

If the daily candle is red, you go short.

You look to go short at the bottom and long at the top.

Now, if you want scalp, you can trade the open cross of the new candle.

That will work too.  But that's a different strategy.

By the way, OrangeRoshan, I didn't mean step on your toes.  These two methods are practically identical.  I just don't like to leave pips lying on the chart.  Might as well rake them into my pile.  Know what I mean?

In fact, there may be a pattern here... depending on the values of High - Top and Bottom - Low, that might determine if you wait for the high to enter or enter at the candle top.

For instance if the value is 10 or less, you may wait for the high but if the value is > 10, you enter at the top... just thinking out loud... would have to run statistics.

What are your thought's Orange?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
This code looks similiar to eSignal.

Do you have documentation?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
SRDC indicator is still not correct. I will fix it as soon as I have more time. Sorry for any inconvenience.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hey,

You say go long on green candle at the top and short on red candle at the bottom. Is the top the open/close or the high and is the bottom the open/close or the low. If you look at some candles, especially when there is consolidation the new candles direction can be very unpredictable.

What would you suggest here.

Good pippin.....

Alex

--- 帖子 #433 ---
level two enter the trade before it hits the S&R. Hence more pips. T1 is at H&L and T2, T3 at other price levels.

In successful trading, other than risk management; Entry and exit techniques must be iddentified correctly with proper goal. It will be discuss more in Level 2 soon.

May the force be with you

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I do agree with you, as entry & exit for SRDC varies. When you notice, Im trying to teach SRDC step by step. Its designed for beginners in mind, hence opened at Beginners forum.

As one has more experience and have relationship with their pair (wife wont mind), it will be very easy to devise entry and exit. Fun damentals & channel helps a lot.

Keep at it and make it your own system.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Great thread Orange. Good discussion going here.

pipraker, in the above statement did you mean "never trade against the daily candle " instead of the hourly?

In post #438 you say:

If the daily candle is green, you go long.

If the daily candle is red, you go short.

Just looking to clarify.

Thanks,

Jim

--- 帖子 #436 ---
It all depends on price analysis and price range (channel). Again, like i said, SRDC is not a fixed system, but rather a simple basic system. Much like linux operating system, an open system with the same basic.

The 5pips thingy is designed for newbies in mind. Any pro knows with small spread pair, 5pips is doable. As u sounded familiar with the basic, ride on the profits, with defensive trading.

The golden rule, "Dont turn a winning trade into a losing one"

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Rock on baby..... Its cool. Read my previous answer to your posts and Alex. Let us know how are you doing and what have you found out. Since it is experimental, do it on your demo 1st. I like to see more of the pattern you mentioned....

You will pips wat you sow!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Just for fun, not hyping anyone (looking left and right, just in case he is there). When you look at the daily candles, level 4, the complete system actually start reaping pips 3 hours after the day candle opens.

This level is developed by the help of my Japanese trading team. It is pure price action stuff (at the moment). On the other hand, level 3 is more on pure quality pips. A system to add more pips in between any trade. It acts as an insurance to previous loss or current negative pips before it turned to positive again. I call it the Impeccable SRDC system.

The trade psychology for all 4 combined are very complex. But, true understanding of the SRDC level 1 will be a good start.

Turning pro is not so much on your account size, but more on consistency and experience. The later cannot be bought or learned, but earned.

My sincere goal is to guide beginners for a good profitable trade right at the beginning. In due time, a proper EA will be developed that will help others to learn the method more interactive.

Now that's Impeccablly a piping goal.

Excellent clarification, pipraker.

thank you very much

Jim

--- 帖子 #442 ---
LOL......

Brilliant!! before i say this i better check the cupboard, or under the table, just incase someone is listening!!

Ok, its a question of affortability. Let me get this straight to everyone. Prepare to lose money!! and when you do, put it inside as your investment column, not as your expenses column. You can put a heading,"Tution fees". please never never never ever think you can get away without losing money and become rich in the end!!

Dear Traders and would be Millionaires and Billionaires;

Congratulations, you have entered the game of the big boys! The very rich! There are no rules except one, that is discipline! I must caution you that, this is not a get rich quick scheme, but a new trillion dollar aday industry. Please dont treat it like a laundy business or a burger stand corner. because when you think that way, I suggest you look to your left immediatelly and walk right now and never come back. There outside the door, you will see a big sign,"DARE TO DREAM, DARE TO TRY".

Prepare to lose money in the beginning. Feel nothing but relief as you are actually paying the big boys for bullying you. In between your journey, you might meet many "so call expert", they are actually agents recruited unconciously by the big boys to take your money away. They are nice and extremelly cautious trader. But make no mistake, this is not why you are in this game. You objective is to WIN WIn WIN! In the end, you will know how the big boys think and they will accept you, and bully the new freshman together.

One of our good agent will call you everytime you trade, his name is Mr. trend. He is your friend. He will guide you against another neutral agent. he call himself "Mr. Market".

In the case of emergency, pls cry and shed many tears. We would asked you to take a week's rest or even a month.

Since Mr. Market is ruthless, we would advise you to seek mentor/s on how to understand him. Let me remind you that, nobody is powerful enough to fight Mr. Market. He really knows his stuff. Word out there, he can speak multiple languages and hold many passports!

Anyway, as a final reminder, please use minimal risk as outlined by many. greed has no place in this industry. So maintain discipline.

Yours Truly;

Mr & Mrs Forex

What is your tolence to loss? How consistent are you in making positive pips? How calm are you when Mr. trend dissapear for a while?

This is an exclusive industry, pls think big and stay green!!

There......... i let it out. Dont complain and ask for pity. every trade you make is your decision. Everytime you lose money, ask the question."What can i learn from this?" when you make money, ask this question,"How can I improve myself more?".

lastly, Stay humble!! NO ONE, I mean No ONE in ths industry is the best or know everything. With good attitude and discipline.... you will make it!!

Now.... shoot me!!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
The bigger the better. So is the Margin and you equity requirements. I have a few accounts riding on weekly candles doing carry trades and occasionally SRDC method level1&2.

This is the chart used by the big boys!!!

Forex, loving it

OrangeRoshan,

I hope to see u here for a long time to come and also yr methods.. ha.

I find you very big-hearted, sharing yr methods and giving lots of sound advice.

I am always reading and taking down notes..

Thanks Jedi Roshan..

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I am humble by your compliments.

Many years ago, I lost big time in a very big trade. Jumping out of the window seems easy. But, my parents prayer saves me.

I said to myself, "whenever i made it thru this, just recover back the losses, I will do my very best to help others". Recover, I did, and success, i have become.

Now, i have a promise to keep!

Thanks Jedi Compro99.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
OrangeRoshan,

Can you elaborate what is trading discipline ??

Everyone saying it but can you be more detailed. I think everyone here will benefit.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hello,

I have mixed feelings about what I am about to say but eventhough PIPRAKER has very informative and helpful information I think that he is moving us away from Orange's plan to go step by step. This thread was meant for beginner and for those who want to reevaluate their approach to trading by using more price action. So I and maybe other also would appreciate if you PIPRAKER try to stay in pace with the rest of us. IF you want to enhance ORANGE's method PLEASE DO IT IN A SEPARATE THREAD and call it PIPRAKER'S SRDC + and I for one when I am ready to do so will read and learn from your experience. In the meantime let us go at the pace and method that ORANGE has set for SRDC. I hope that in the spirit of helping you follow my advice.

Thank You

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I definitelly agree with you!

OrangeRoshan and I had discussed this matter in PM.

Our methods are so similiar that I thought posting in this thread was appropriate and OrangeRoshan agreed.

To start another thread would add to the confusion.

Once again, I had asked the AUTHOR OF THIS THREAD for permission to post here and received it.

4rex, You are not the author of this thread.  First you said you didn't want me posting here. Now you want me to start another thread?  Me thinks you have overstepped your bounds.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Pipraker

I've been doing a close research on both methods and my humble opinion is that they are very similar and could be a nice complement one to the other

Hope not to offend anybody just my point of view

my first post here

Orange

I sincerely hope you have all the blessing a man could have for sharing with us your system

If you kindy answer my concern here as follows:

I am having excellent results with your system. No questions ask.

But my concern is that, for 5 winers, I have 1 loser that will eat most of my profits due wider stops. I know stop-losses has been something that some people here has debated here and there. I an not in a position to argue just to see if we can find a balance between stop-losses and take profits.

Maybe an idea would be traling the stops to take advantage of the whole movement during the day. That way we could balance out and compensate for the losses.

Please Orange, my apologies in advance if my tone sounded a little contrarian as it was not my intention to be

may the force be with you dear master

be blessed

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Pipraker

Thank you so much for sharing your strategy. One question

You're using the body of the candle to establish bias and 60 minutes charts for entries(please correct me if I'm wrong)

Do you need for the day to "mature" in order to establish the bias? Maybe would be advisable to use New York opening I assume

Thanks my friend

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hmmm.  Pipraker is now banned?

I thought everyone was civil.  He had interesting thoughts.

Didn't see that one coming I'm afraid.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
how do u know he is banned?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I think the banning is due in part to the poster having placed a text link to another site on his graphics. That would be a no no in the factory rules before post 50. Just thinking about what i'm seeing here.

I'm into the details so i picked up on it upon first viewing the graphics. To me it is no big deal as we, the collective learners, are all in this together and i feel that each of the forex-teaching sites out there will have tid bits of information that will trigger an "AHA" moment in any one of us. Forex Factory is my home base, though i can not express my heart felt gratitude to those wonderful, intellegent individuals in other FX related forums that have contributed ideas that are unique to the thread that contaned the data. Competition made America strong, it won't hurt any of the FX forums to have others out there sharing their concepts and tools. . . but rules are rules. There are many here, who have xxx posts that also have links in their profile to useful sites and are priceless for their focus on particular areas of research and development as it relates to trading. Each has a purpose.

Now back to our SPONSOR (this thread's topic). grin.

Pipraker,

As you can see from Orange's response to your post he clearly states the purpose of this thread. You are taking this way too personally and even though I am not the author of this thread, this site is a forum defined as "a public meeting place for open discussion". The suggestion was given in the hope that you would understand that as beginners is important to learn in a sequential and orderly manner. THAT IS WHY IS IN THE FOREX BEGINNER'S SECTION. I think I have stated my opinion based on the original intention of this thread. What happens from now on is up to the council  .

P.S Please check this thread to find out more about PIPRAKER posts and how other senior members feel about it. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ad.php?t=10257

Thank somebody in power; thats over.

Hey Orange; SRDC worked great today.

I have been either taking a smaller TP setting or not placing an order on the side that is within 20 pips of a pivot point and also removing the opposite side once a cross has been made. Working good for me. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I was tinkering abt Jedi OrangeRoshan method.

I wonder if the suggestion works.. and maybe people here can together test it.

================

OHLC

If yesterday is bear daily candle, today take short position 1pip below yesterday Low and long position at 1pip above yesterday Open.

If yesterday is bull daily candle, today take long position at 1pip above yesterday High and short position at 1pip below yesterday Close.

We can then set SL/TP as per original SRDC 1.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
The more I look at this the more interesting it becomes. Along with James16 price action, it looks good.

Nice work, compro99.

Jim

--- 帖子 #473 ---
This is a broad topic, where one can write a book on it. I will try to explain in brief and as simple as possible.

In a broader sense, to me Discipline is an act of thinking. It can be divided into parts:

Humble, Respect, Knowledge, Practice, execution of trades, Consistency.

Risk or Money management is a big part of discipline, and falls under Knowledge, practice, execution of trades and consistency. That is why it is very important. Skill can be learnd but disciple can only be mastered.

an example of discipline in terms of execution of trade, would be "always respect the market. When trend is your friend, Market is your best friend! Market would gives you opportunity to make money from him, not everytime. To make sure market gives you pips, Be kind to the market. Dont force entries into the market, he will be offended and curse you".

From the above Jedi statements, it will give you discipline and in return profitable in the long run.

May the pips be with you

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I have no problems with you entry and exit method. and your posts are great. But as the community says, you got too excited my man. Make posts in a manner of questions, answers and findings at reasonable level.

LOL, cool everyone.

Both of you are right. Infact, Pipraker i wont mind you start your new thread on your SRDC different strategy. It would be a good service to every Padawan and Jedi here. yeaaaah, Why not. Ill support your thread too. We all will.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
You need to understand the method more in order to make more pips. Learn price action and range. Use the channel, this way, you will know the direction of the candles. Its actually very ez, I mean it and i know soon you will see it too.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Orange,

Nice to read your contagious posts again to get us back on track. In previous posts you mentioned that in order to find a balance between take profit and stop loss that we need to ride the profit...but you have also said that with SRDC you can succesfully make 5-10 pips with a stop loss of 20-30 pips without monitoring the trade.  So can we really expect to be on the plus side without monitoring our trade?

One more thing you talk about using channels but I am not clear how to create and use them. Could you elaborate on it or is that the next step with SRDC 2?

Thanks again  for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I want to thanks again Jedi Roshan for teaching price action down to the most fundamental level which gave me some ideas. This can be formulate into day trading and swing trading ideas by looking at daily and weekly candle.

Most important is the price structure gave an objective view of the trade.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Picture this, Jabba on diet...... NOT!!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thanks Compro, I have a trader (in my team) who is a personal student of Abe Cofnas, he traded what he called,"Market structure". It is a formation of candles, when formed, will produce a short term trend. It added to any system for entry and exit. Price action? bring it on......

I wonder when Jedis can move candles...........!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I know you probably would still have losses, but let me ask a few questions. Would you ignore Sunday candle on this? Second, look at 11/02 and 11/03 candles. 11/02 was bull. The 11/3 candle went up 8 pips higher than 11/2, minus the 1 pip wait would only be 7 pips. Subtracting the spread (and I believe 3 pips is the lowest spread I've seen) would only net 4, so you'd lose on that one. Is that what you see too? Like I said I know no matter what system you lose, but I wanted to make sure I understood you correctly.

The only other comment I would make is the one about shorting 1 pip below yesterday's close. The open the next day could easily be 1 pip lower than the close, but may not follow through. Have you noticed this?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
which currency are u referring to ? GBP ??

I would say ignore the sunday candle.

If it is GBP, 11/02 was a bearish candle. Use that bearish candle Open Price for long(reversal of bias) and Low for short(trend). I did not see any issue.. based on GBP.

Last checked, 11/03 is NFP day, well, i wouldnt wanna trade before the news come out.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi, any mt4 programmer here ?

I uploaded a mq4 which shows yesterday and today OHLC on daily chart. Can anyone further improve to show last weekly candle OHLC ???

--- 帖子 #488 ---
hmmm, ok ingoring 11/3 as nfp day, assume it was a normal day, is what I wrote correct? Hey nevermind I guess. GMT candle for 11/2 was bullish, not bearish. Must be another timezone thing. 11/3 was bearish.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
What i wrote was an suggestion. Just keep for reference and instead focus on what Jedi Roshan has to say and his SRDC. Let's learn together... step by step.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
yes, but if your suggestion causes a higher success rate for the basic method, it may be something to look at by all wouldn't you agree? However, since our charts are different, we can't determine that unless what you wrote IS what you meant. I guess I initially wrote because I thought you may have made a mistake by the "use the OPEN of the previous candle" for bearish yesterday, but apparently you meant it, so now I can watch out for it and just use it as a "maybe it will work better" idea. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Ok, i was trying to improve entry.

If yesterday is bearish candle, If price goes down further.. we use the yesterday low as entry(intial confirmation of trend). But if price goes up... instead of using yesterday high, we use yesterday open to get earlier entry (could be reversal or retracement)

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Roshan,

I loved your analogy but instead of Jaba I prefer to picture this:

OOLA.....la lala

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi Compro99,

I appreciate your addition here. I had a question. You said,

My question is about your second statement (where the daily candle is bull). Would it not be better to say: "If yesterday is bull daily candle, today take long position at 1 pip above yesterday high and short position at 1 pip below yesterday open" (instead of close)? That would make the statement consistent with the first statement (where the daily candle is bear.)

Just wanting to get your thoughts on that. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Of COURSE I'm here...and will ALWAYS be checking my "hype-meter" on ALL posts. bwahahaha!

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Roshan,

Would you consider this a channel?

--- 帖子 #496 ---
MikeJody,

U got it right. It should be yesterday Open. I was confused.. hahaha...!!!!

--- 帖子 #497 ---
hold on now I am confused. Your first and second post both say if bullish use yesterday's close. That was why I wrote and even said you must've really meant close. Now you are saying the open on both bullish and bearish????

Please shoot me or help me.

Maybe I am misunderstanding as well. YIKES

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Yesterday Bullish Bar

================

Long it at yesterday High and Short it at yesterday Open.

Yesterday Bearish Bar

================

Short it at yesterday Low and Long it at yesterday Open.

This is correct now !

great, makes MUCH more sense now.

Could someone post some results from the EA?  Just curious as to how Skyline's version is working in forward tests.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I would rather candles with a light background for es standardization.

Anyway, look at the chart I enclosed. Hope that pips.

MEDIAN

Watch how the price move up down, start and settle near the median (use period saperator). This way you will know where the price will go next. After drawing on Daily, draw on H1 and use it as Micro trading the Daily candles.

May your chart pips positively

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Roshan,

Thanks again,  es? what is that? Your chart is not easy to read but are you using the strato? How about using Bollinger Bands?  I am a bit confuse with the channel idea...sorry.  I am trying to incorporate it into SRDC

--- 帖子 #504 ---
LOL

es is EZ (easy) a type mismatch. That was your chart, sorry I make it smaller to follow the forum's maximum rule.

Try drawing the SRDC channel or even Pitchfork (similar) on the 1 hour chart. You will see, price starts at the median, move either to the High and low then back to the median at the end of the day. Its not perfect, but thats the general idea.

Now, How to apply to SRDC? When the candles is near to the channel (H 0r L), the chances of it breaking the trend is slim (unless a trend change). So, the only probable direction is towards the median and the opossite trendline.

See the prvious day's H & L (S&R). Since you have establish a probable direction, it is only logical to enter a trade following this direction. Early entry will be possible without waiting for it to break the previous H & L (actually this is part of level 2 explaination).

In the case of price near the trend line (H&L), T1 is the Median & T2 is break of previous day's H&L (S&R) and T3 is the opposite Trend. Proper Money Management will satisfy your lust for Jaba's GF, oppss sorry I mean positive pips!!

The rest is reversal!! When you can master this method, a day range can produce pips equal to 1 day range x 1.5. Eventually, the price will goback to the median again at end of the day!!

Understand the above statements, and SRDC level pandora's box is open!!

Hey "Orange",

Do you have a set of rules for drawing the channel lines or is there a custom indicator for this?

Alex

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I havent complied the rules in a standard manner, coz im so used to seeing the candles, a glance will click my thoughts to draw it. But, I will try to simplify it below.

Rules on 1hr:

1. Use Euiqdistant Channel to contain the latest trend within the channel

2. 1 day channel is not very accurate

3. 2 days channel will show a trend

4. 3 days channel will complete a channel.

5. Find the Highs of the 1-2-3days and the lows which touches the trendline the most!! = Channel. An extreme H & L may not count!!

6. Adjust as the next day candles finish forming.

7. Draw a Median (parallel to the Channel)

8. A perfect channel will be when you can draw, the start and end of day to be near or on the median. However sometimes this is not possible. The nearer the median to the day start and end the better.

9. use the end of day saperator.

10. Use candles & Bear black and bull white when possible. And light background so Jedi dont have wear glasses!! LOL

Channel Jedi, where PIPs eposide 1-99 are shown!!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Thanks for the low down on the rule set for channels. I did some digging around for a custom indicator and found this one. Maybe you could have a look and see if it fits your criteria.

Thanks again

Alex

I know Orange said don't set up a trade in the same direction again because buying power may be over so today long would be over. BUT, what if you set it up 1 pip higher than the high so far. This in case some new buying power comes along. It is hard to test this on the daily charts because you don't know the details behind the day. Anyway, just thought I'd ask that question to see what others thought.

I traded compro's variation today and got 7 pips.

You read my mind. I am just sitting here looking at GBP/USD?????

Hello Fellow Roshanites!

I came across this post that I think can help us determine/confirm the direction of our entries if we decide not to straddle. Basically, and there is probably more ways to use it, I plan to use it as a Stop Loss indicator and to help me determine based on Daily Range which way to go (long/short). The risk to reward can be modify to your taste.What do you guys/gals think?

<HR style="COLOR: #d1d1e1" SIZE=1><!-- / icon and title --><!-- message -->Hi everyone,

Here's a little "indicator" that does some basic calculations for us.

Let's look at what it does:

It computes yesterday's range, the previous 5, 10 and 20 days ranges. And it calculates the "Average Day Range" of these four ranges (yesterday's+ Prev 5 Day Range + Prev 10 Day Range + Prev 20 Day Range)/4.

So, if yesterday's Day Range was 80, the Previous 5 Day Range was 110, the Previous 10 Day Range was 90 and the Previous 20 Day Range was 120, then the Average Day Range would be 100.

Then there's "Room Up" and "Room Down".

Let's imagine today's low is (so far) 1000 and today's high is (so far) 1050. At this moment the price is 1020.

So we're 1020-1000= 20 pips above the low, there is therefore 100-20=80 pips "left" up. For a risk-to-reward ratio of (say) 3, if a long trade was to be entered now, the stop loss should be no more than 80/3=26pips away, that is at 1020-26=994. So, if all conditions are met, we ll look for a "bottom" no lower than 994.

Same thing for a short trade: we are 1050-1020= 30 pips below the high, there is therefore 100-30=70 pips "left" down. For a risk-to-reward ratio of 3, if a short trade was to be entered now, the stop loss should be no more than 70/3=23pips away, that is at 1020+23=1043. So, if all conditions are met, we ll look for a "top" no higher than 1043.

As you can see, this indicator doesn't tell us whether or not we have a set up to trade. What it does is, considering some past day ranges, and for a given Risk to Reward ratio, it tells us how far away we can put a stop loss.

Hope this helps,

Ogeima.

P.S.: I used H-L (High-Low) to compute the Ranges. They are thus a bit different from mataf.net data, which computes what is known as the "True" Ranges (= Max(High for the period less the Low for the period,High for the period less the Close for the previous period,Close for the previous period and the Low for the current period)).

Master Roshan,

I find myself in a quagmire when dealing with channels  . My apologies to the highest authority...but I may for now, stick to Habeeb's Pivot indicators where they can be trace daily/weekly/monthly. Is this a significant deviation from your up and coming Step2?

Thank you once again for your unrelentless effort to help

--- 帖子 #512 ---
hmm, well I won't trade it, but we'll see what happens today if it makes it that way.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
well it went 2 pips higher then reversed. On a side note, another buy at the original long would've produced another +pip

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I think I understand. Does this look right?  The lines are for the previous day's open, close, high, low and middle.  I found the indicator in eSignal.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Going long at the high made me pips.  I think I understand.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Pip are you using yesterday's high/low? or a 60 minute? I couldn't tell from your chart.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I used yesterday's Open/Close/High/Low on 1 hour chart.  Did I do it wrong?

I go short at yesterday's close and make pips.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Ok, let me say this - orange strategy as posted you would use high/low from previous day. If you are using compro's variation you have to look at yesterday's candle. If green buy 1 pip higher than yesterday's HIGH, sell 1 pip lower than yesterday's OPEN (not close)... If red (down day), sell 1 pip lower than yesterday's LOW, buy 1 pip higher than yesterday's OPEN (again not close).

If you use yesterday's close, the chances the new daily candle going 1 pip above/below it are probably near 100%, but you may not get pips that way before it reverses.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Price was above yesterday's close and going down.  I short at close number.  I make pips.  How I make pips if I do it wrong?  I don't understand?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
well, you can definitely make pips if it is going in your direction. Try it out for yourself and if it continues to win for you, go for it.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
by the way, I was just questioning what strategy you were using. None of the strategies listed here use the close of yesterday. Compro posted that at first, but corrected himself.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I read whole thread.  It say go short on red candle at the line.  So I go short on red candle at the line.  What I do wrong?

--- 帖子 #523 ---
ok, if you read it that's fine. Maybe I missed that post. It has been a while since I read the entire thread. Sorry. Or maybe it was posted by the user that was banned. I never understood that strategy yet anyway.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I am not getting the best results with the automatic EA written by Skyline. my losses are more than my gains. I am a newbie though and not sure if I am making mistakes. Can someone please post their manual entries and exits for one of the trades just so as i compare them to mine. See if I am doing the manual trades wrong or right. Much appreciated

Lena

Et;

It will be better I think, if you go to the beginning of this thread and on your first pass threw read only what has been written by Orange. Every time I read threw a thread I pick up something new.

The force will be with you.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I have not been following the development of this thread but the system itself in essence is simple and beautiful. Your analysis will start from daily, if trend is up wait for pvs day hgh break and get in the trade. Take profit fast. This system is good for low pip spread pairs

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I go short at blue line and make pips.  I think I do it right.  This not too hard.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
That is what he asked though.. Did you go long at the pink line?

How many you going for pip?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
llambert

I think pink line is yesterday's mid range, that is why he does not go long on that line, he goes long on the previous day's high; he will clarify it though.

That is what I understand.

Hi, This looks nice, where could I go to get this indicator?

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I use eSignal charts.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
OrangeRoshan, your system seems to work but with the gbpusd spread being 4 pips, going for 5 pips only nets 1 pip.  I know you can triple your money with 1 pip a day in a year but you only make real money if you either have a big account to start with or risk most of your small account unless I don't understand.  Do you avoid the higher spreads?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
How do you avoid higer spreads?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I would not be too concerned that the SRDC method as we now understand it is not making profits long-term (whether you use an EA or do manual trades). As the author has mentioned,  the SRDC method consists of 4 levels. My understanding of his approach to teaching the method to beginners is that we will need to understand each level thoroughly before the next is presented. Trade only on a demo for now - you will have ups and downs but the main idea now is to understand how level 1 works, not to make profits.

I've done quite a bit of testing (and attempts at optimizing) with an EA of my own based on level 1. I have not found any settings that will consistently make money with the information we now have so I'm waiting patiently for the author to reveal level 2.

Hang loose, have patience, be sure you understand the material presented so far and we'll all se what happens next...

--- 帖子 #550 ---
5pips - 4pips = 1pip? 1pip aday? Are you sure i teach that?

Messa think, NOT!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
As the name suggests, AVOID!! so avoid higher spread pair then. Stick withs currency with low spread.

Anyway, Playing4pips misunderstood the method. The 5pips is after the spread, and you dont have to get 5pips only. You can have more. Thats just basics.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Wellsaid Lou.

Many i saw didnt understand the method, even it is sooo simple. Some didnt read the whole thread, or my whole posts. Quiet frustrating.

or is my english really that bad?? LOL

Anyway, stay sidelined for now, dont trade as holiday season is approaching. There are many Stoploss hunter around. Just practice, practice and Practice!!

May the turkey be on my plate!!

--- 帖子 #553 ---
It would be very good for all if this thread could stay on track. I understand that each person who posts their own spin is only trying to help but it does get confusing - much like the game "telephone" played at parties.

I have seen many threads lose direction completely.  I remember one  on another forum earlier this year - a method  called  FXovereasy - that started out as a good, simple beginner system but quickly acquired fib lines and camarilla lines,  talking  indicators  and tap-dancing  indicators and  soon did not  even resemble the original method.

Let's not allow that to happen here.

Good holiday to all,

Lou

--- 帖子 #554 ---
@ Lou

well, you want the easy going original sytem from the very beginning of this thread? Ok, no problem. Then just STOP complaining here and finally START to trade it in real life ... and eventually become filthy rich. Sometimes life is really that simple.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Yes, but basics must work too.  But your idea with the 5 pips is a good method. Probably the best idea of this thread. Without any stop loss you'll reach an accuracy of almost 100%. No stop loss is a problem for you? Well, just risk 10% of your account and everything will work. Easy, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I'm re-posting the original SRDC indicator and the EA I use below. After I posted the first version of the indicator I received a request to change it to accomodate different times for starting the "day". I tried to do this but, since I am not a very experienced MQL4 coder, it never worked properly so I gave up for now- perhaps I'll get it working in the future.

The indicator and expert posted run on server time. For me, this is GMT+2 but, as the author of this thread has said, when your server starts the day should have no effect on the functionality of the approach.

The modifiable items in the EA are self-explanatory:

InitialStop - just what it says

TakeProfit - ditto

TrailingStop - if non-zero, will be applied in the normal way

Padding - this is the amount suggested by OrangeRoshan to be added to the price for the stop orders.

StartTime - Not used (see above). Orders will be opened/closed when your server says it is midnight.

The EA has been tested pretty thoroughly and seems to do the basic job. Any problems, please post to the thread rather than PM me.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi Folks!

I just found this thread today and just went through all the posts.  Very interesting thread.  One question, is the original manual method in post 1 still valid, or has it been changed?  If so, is there a newer document on how to trade it?  Thank you!

Sir Wolf

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I just discovered that this EA will not function properly if InitialStop is equal to zero. Default is 20 - you can change it if you wish but be sure it's greater than zero. I'll fix it down the road a bit.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
My backtesting does not indicate that this method (as we know it up to this point) will produce long-term profits, but perhaps you are right. I will be the first to wave as you drive by in your new Lamborghini . I think I'll wait to see what OrangeRoshan has in mind for levels 2,3 and 4.

May the Schwartz be with you...

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Lou,

have you tested it without SL?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Yes, and also attempted to optimize several combinations of the primary factors (InitialStop, TakeProfit, TrailingStop). I have had some short-term success, a good month here and there, but no success in testing for the current year-to-date. That's why I want to wait and see what is in store from the author in subsequent levels of the method - I feel there is a great deal of potential in this approach. OrangeRoshan has made several veiled references to using multiple lots (vis-a-vis Vegas) and tiered defensive trading techniques (T1, T2, T3) and I'm eager to see how he will tie all this together.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hey,

I've had great results with this method. Before the new daily candle starts I get a feel for the pairs I'm trading, fundamentally and technically . Each pair is like the weather,its going to have a different dynamic from day to day. You have to prepare for it each day.

Regards

Alex

--- 帖子 #563 ---
No misunderstanding between us - I think this approach has great potential. Attached find a Strategy Builder report for the period 10/26 (the day after the thread began) through the current day. As you can see, the return on investment is excellent for a 100% mechanical strategy. I used a stoploss of 20 and takeprofit of 40 to get these numbers. Unfortunately, when applied to a longer term similar profits are not there. Perhaps the info contained in the 75% of the method that has not been revealed yet will enable similar profit to be obtained on a consistent basis.

I'm a big fan of SRDC

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hey,

Good on you for doing your own research and establishing a frame work to move within. I personally like to look after my trades until the're into positive pips, at my descretion, then "BE" for the larger move with a "TP" also at my descretion. Remember before I trade I research the pairs I'm trading to get a feel for where they are fundamentally and technically.

All the best

Alex

Hi Everyone,

Stay motivated as im ready to moved on to level 2. Since Level 2 is not for beginners, It will be posted at Trading Systems Forum. Those are not familliar with Level 1, I suggest to study this thread 1st then move on to the Level 2 after a proper understanding of it.

Let me remind everyone, especially beginners: I will not entertain Newbie question inside the new Thread. Newbie questions should be posted here where it belongs.

I did not try ur EA yet, but I am wonderig since I am using the same EA for all pair ( RURUSD GBPUSD AUDUSD) still I noticed that when the StopLoss is trigerred the losses are totally different for each pair. The Profits are different too! Any expalination for that?

Orange, I am I guess a newbe at this and downloaded the OrangeRoshhan's SRDC Method. I under stand you put a trendline at the support and one at the resistance. an wait for the trade to open and take your pips and close. once the trade opens close the other one and that is it. Have I got this right or what am I missing. I here everyone talking about EA's and I don't know what that is can you inlghten on that please.And is there something I am missing.And is there a SL set or not.

Please help I want to be a good trader when I start my first real account. I have been looking for a Method now fpr 6 months. I still have alot to learn and I still can not keep a postive account...

Thanks

A cry for Help....

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Harry, I think you got all the method wrong, sorry mate. You open trades that penetrated the Support & Resistance, which is the High and Lows of the Daily candle (switch to daily candle and look at yesterday's candle versus todays').

The Trend lines, The channel we call it has a median ( a parallel line to both the high trend and low trend lines). This is use to determined and anticipate the candle movement in H1 chart. You may also draw it on Daily.

Download my original attachment on my 1st post and read thoroughly. As you are a beginner, pls use demo account only, until you know your stuff. But when you must use you life account, use minimal, say 0.01 lot.

Happy pipping

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Yeah, sorry. A little bit confused here. I don't completely follow what you mean by 5+spread+1 ; stop loss zero.

Where exactly do you place the stop order for the breakout. 5 pips +spread, 6pips + spread?

Example:

Let's say support is at 10 (some number) : would short stop be at 4, 5,?

Let's say resistance is at 20 (some number) : would long stop be at 25,26?

*Both spreads are 5.

Targets are +5, +10, and what not...

Stop loss is 10 for all three majors, am I correct?

Also, there's some templates that I'm testing that is very similar to this (level trading) that I might share if all goes well...

Thanks

Yeah, thanks. But I've already read it like twice before. I accidentally asked him via email and he told me the stuff. I didn't know the stoploss had to be so big though. 50 stop loss for 5~10 gain? Thought stoploss was like 10 for a 5 pip gain.

A stoploss is not necessarily a win/loss ratio But more importantly to keep your trade a winning one, which in this case Stooped-out on a temporary trend change before following the original trend.

This is an incredibly popular thread.. wish I had started following it earlier. Looks like quite a few people were enjoying themselves (first 5 pages, as far as I got  ).

Maybe this indicator can help in some way. I personally use it to identify entry and exit points for my trades. When the Indicator reverses directions from one extreme to another that is my que to either exit the trade im in,enter a trade or reverse direction. Once you download it, open it with your editor and change the CCI setting from 50 to 14, then change the TCCI setting from 0 to 14. The yellow line on the indicator is serving as an early warning to direction changes. I use it on Daily charts and have been following your thread Episode 1 and now Episode 2 and see you like the Daily chart as well ,and thought this may help. If not I dont want to confuse my fellow Padawn's with this and if you say so Master Orange tell them to ignore my ignorance,i will understand. Allow Master Orange to examine the indicator before the questions start, as he may not want us using it in his methods.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
The correct setting for TCCI is change from 0 to 6 not 14.

Hi skyline,

i would like to ask some questions about the EA u developed for this system.

im using SRDCv2.1 btw.

if i using

StopLoss     = 30

MOVE_SL_AT=10

MOVE_SL_TO= 1

SL_variable  = false

TrailingStop = 15

When i enter a buy at 1.200, SL will be 1.260. when prices reaches 1.2010(10 pips profit), the SL will be changed to 1.2001.

Does the trailing stop still come into play when i use the move sl at function?

if it does, how does it work?

What i am trying to acheive with this EA is to have a sl of 30 initially. when trade is 10 pip in profit. move sl to 1 pip profit. then when profit is 30pips clear from new SL, the trailing stop starts working. so when pip profit is at 45 pips, we can lock in another 15 pips profit and so on.

Another alternative i can think off is that we have a few levels of move_sl_at functions. then we can set our custom made "trailing stop"

However it must not be able to backtrack to the previous set SL when the price starts going down.

I hope i sound right here

Thanks

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Autumn, with the pound and its movement you don't think if you are in 10 pip profit that the price will go and get your +1, before making a big move up? I would almost bet it would happen more often than not and you would miss out. Just curious your thoughts on that.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
If i were to use a 30 pip profit before placing SL to breakeven,44% of the trades would not hit a 30pip profit for me to move my SL. resulting in a 30pip lost.

If i were to use a 10pip profit before moving SL to breakeven or 1, only 16% of the trades were going to hit SL.

As im planning to trade this the conservative way, i would rather take a 1 pip profit from those trades and to earn from the other trades that can move more than 45 pips. From my very basic backtest, roughly 35% of the trade move more than 45 pips. which means a profit of 16 pips for each trade.

Doing a very rough calculation, with 100 trades we would get 16 hit SL for -480 pips, 35 hit 16 pips profit(this could be more as some pair move more than 45 pips on some moves) and 49 trades hitting 1pip profit making it a grand total of 149!

i know its not alot but its a conservative way of calculating

i welcome any comments on what i have written be it good or bad

Autum,

To follow up with Llambert's comment, which pair(s) are you referring to? As you probably already know, volatility plays a role so the daily range of Gbp(100+ pips) can affect your parameters in comparison with a short range pair such as Cad (40+ pips)

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Sorry i was referring to Eur/usd pair

--- 帖子 #596 ---
SRDC1 had 2 trades today, cable and swissy, both hit SL for loss.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hmmm... I made 50 jedi pips on GBP 2day and still riding Last expected to hit TP 1.8465. Its a short day for GBP.

Maybe you long the GBP trade?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
yes. I places them at about 0200 GMT on the previous IBFX daily candle. Buy and sell stops at the top and bottom. the cable buy was stopped out (SL50) as was the USDCHF this afternoon (SL30).

the sell stop hasn't been hit, it's at 1.9320 so I'm very surprised you have a short trade unless it's a SRDC2 trade.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Yes. Use Level 2 to evaluate SRDC I. But even at SRDC I, I think, I mentioned this somewhere in this thread. I would caution you from taking Long in this case as it is at the year HIGH! Resistance is furtile.

No worries, look at H1  Channel and see where the candle settle. Then you will know the direction of the Candle tomorrow.

Get back your SL in style not in revenge.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
jedi,

here's my screenshot for cable today. Does this match yours? can I assume that cable is expected to become bearish as it's outside the channel?

{Friendly reminder here to post charts without black backgrounds as per Orange Roshans thread rules...Thanks}

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hmm... i will look at it. Experiment with it. When it works use it. When it doesnt, its ok.

reversal in SRDC is when it touches the trendlines, as the dances in Trend explained in SRDC II. Its 90% accurate and realtime. The only time its wrong is when a trend is chanding and a slope is increasing due to momentum.

Hope that pips

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I need a torchlight!!

--- 帖子 #603 ---
ahhh, it may work with that one. I doubt gbp/usd would though.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Where did you trigger your trade?  Surely not at Support. I didn't see a short trade on SRDC I.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
looking at my chart above you can see that GBP just hit the long trigger (3 pips above previous day's high) before retracing. I'm sure avoiding the weekly highs etc would have avoided this (ie. only putting a sell-stop) but then again cable's been making lots of new highs.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
No, Not SRDC 1. Its too risky as the pounds are just too high.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Does anyone have fun with GBP and EUR today?

SRDC I gives a lot of Jedi Pips today.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Yes,

had good trades today on NZD, AUD, EURO, GBP and CHF. I'm watching 8 pairs and make my move based on price action near S and R and "market personality".

The good pips to all the Jedi here..

Alex

--- 帖子 #609 ---
nearly 50 on the Eur, and 75 on the GBP. Fun stuff breaking out of ranges.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Bad day for this knight. Had stops to close.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
had a couple of losers on USDCHF. think I'll stick to cable as seems to have more momentum pushing through resistance.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi,

Hope someone is still watching SRDC I. I would like to confirm my understanding of last night's action.

Therefore, this covers the transition between 5th Dec and 6th Dec. It seems to me that had you placed a straddle on the 5th Daily candle, say around 00.03 GMT on the 6th Dec, then you would not have seen the S/R penetrated (going through previous low of 1.9674 - spread - 1) until approximately 09.30 GMT. Is this correct?

Thanks for any help!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi exastris,

Can your explain in a chart (light colour pls), or re-sentence that question again please. Sorry, i didnt get your question.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

I am trying to follow your instructions as outlined in post # 28 of this thread.

Please see charts attached with HIGH and LOW of 5th Candle in dotted red lines and 5 min chart for 6th december.

So, to confirm my understanding, to place a straddle just after 5th Daily candle finishes, I would place two orders, at say 00.03 GMT on 6th December (I'm using IBX platform).

STRADDLE ORDER:

FIRST ORDER:

BUY @ (5th DAILY HIGH) + spread + 1

5th DAILY HIGH = 1.9084 and assume spread = 3

Threfore place BUY @ 1.9088 (SL = 25 for me  )

Take 5 pips profit, therefore close order @ 1.9093

SECOND ORDER:

SELL @ (5th DAILY LOW) - spread - 1

5th DAILY LOW = 1.9674 and assume spread = 3

Therefore SELL @ 1.9670 (SL = 25)

Take 5 pips profit, therfore close order @ 1.9665.

Summary:

Only SECOND ORDER is triggered.

We notice that on 5 min chart LOW of DAILY 5th was penetrated at approx 09.25 GMT on 6th. Which is approximately where my SELL would have opened and quickly closed. Correct?

Sorry to be so pedantic, but I am trying to get the fundementals in place before I go any further.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Yes correctly done.

Just a suggestion. Take a calculated risk by exiting 90% of the lot at desire TP (SL to breakeven) and let the 10% ride until an opposite trend candle appear on the 15mins chart. This way, you can harvest more pips with less risk.

Pipastic!!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Grand Master Jedi Orange Roshan, may I ask you a question?

Why do you take BUY price and SELL price on the same way (say spread = 5, then 6 points away from high / low)?

In my platform, High-Low usually represented by Bid price, both of them.

If we put SELL order at Low - 5 - 1, I can understand that we get Bid price.

But when we decide to put BUY order at High + 5 + 1, then I suspect that price we calculate is BID price, not OFFER/ASK price. If we want to BUY, why we don't buy on that calculated price + spread again = (high + 5 + 5 + 1) ?

For example : these High Low prices are BID prices

HIGH = 1.9711

LOW = 1.9609

So we put SELL Order on 1.9609-5-1 = 1.9603 <-- Sure this is BID price

BUY order on 1.9711+5+1 = 1.9717 <-- I suspect this is BID price, not ASK price, so if we tend to BUY, by the time the price reach 1.9717 on BID, then the ASK/OFFER price should be 1.9717+ spread (5) = 1.9722.

I do really need explanation on this Grand Master. Thanks!

PS : Master Roshan, you gave me a very clear view to get profit in Forex. I did a calculation in Excel file to find out if we start investment with some little amount in $US, what we will get in JUST ONE YEAR. The result was so amazing.....JUST FOR 5 PIPS TARGET..that looks so possible everyday! How come we're blind for it's 5 pips target all this time? My trader team have a promise, that if our calculation go right in one year, we'll not knock-knock on your door, instead we'll send you some souvenir gift. That's a Jedi Promise.......   , better you give your address in Brunei Master!

Ola to all; Have faith padawans the journey is about to become fruitfully for you. REALLY.

I have just finished my third read threw of SRDC I and have picked up some more nuances I did not get before.

I have found it helpful to print at least everything that Master OrangeRoshen has posted keep them in a notebook and make notes on the printouts including questions.. There are riddles to unfold. If it was just given out you would not be interested and would fade to the dark side. Persevere.

Ahead of you now is the SRDC II in it you will find a path to the Jedi conference room. Be sure to have a firm grasp on SRDC I before participating as the Jedi are excited and sometimes there sabers flash in real battle and padawans may misunderstand and be injured.

Attached is a picture of a star ship breaking threw into SRDC II. This is a real picture bye the way not doctored.

Hi everyone ,

first of all i really wanted to thank orange roshan for sharing such a great system , i've just finished reading the thread , and im currently reading srdc level 2 . So i just found broker "efx group" and they have spread 1-2 pips , i think it could be the perfect broker for this 5 pip system , so i wanted to ask u guys if ur already trading with them . By the way what are the best brokers (reliable , low spread ) for this system , and which of them show charts during weekends ? I ve got my broker from russia , but they dont show charts at the weekends . So if anyone could help , i would really appreciate it .

Oh and i live in Tashkent (Uzbekistan) so is it possible to open an account at US brokers ?

thanks for the support .

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I personally use Oanda to trade this system. Check http://www.oanda.com/cgi/new_account_reg, Uzbekistan is listed as an available country. During high volume times, London and NY sessions there are often sub 2 spread on eur/usd and sub 3 on gbp/usd. They do have weekend charting, they are open 24/7, though it isnt metatrader charting and is not very high quality. I hope this helps a little.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
thanks for the info stockkjay , do they have only 50:1 leverage ? what about 100:1 ?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Unfortunate for some they do only have 50:1. Though do not hold that against them. With a good strategy like SRDC 1 and 2 both seem to be, that will only impair small accounts for a small time.

I do not know if your account is small, it is just many like 100:1, even 200:1 because they feel they will profit quicker.

If you go under the broker forum on this site, I am sure there will be a few individuals that may be able to give you better suggestions.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
If the padawans here would like to see the "Sunday/Monday candel" and the "break below yesterday,s low" demonstrated, just look at todays GBP on a 5 or 15 minute chart. Both tech are principals of SRDC I and where good for about 100 pips so far and we are only 11 hrs into the day.

Follow the path

Hi Roshan

Thanks for ur Great method i like it a lot and i think that this Method safe up to 25 pip t/p i'm thinking now about insterting Trailing stop on this method

45 pages is a lot to read i read only to pg 15 do u have any update in this Method after this point (Expect Ea's)

--- 帖子 #624 ---
fuh...

Ive been reading from pages 1 till now, and i have to say that im very impress with the master jedi OrangeRoshan ways of teaching( + jokes and sarcasm  ).

Ive already tried backtest and well the result seems promising. But ive notice many complain about the risk to reward ratio. Well for me, im still a newbie and still need alot of reading and demo trading and SRDC i think is the easier method to trade with.

1 question though, can we use this system to trade during big news such as NFP? Since ive notice, if using SRDC both buy and sell stop will be open, so is it advisable to trade?

thanks

--- 帖子 #625 ---
I thought that for SRDC 1 we need to look at daily chart only?

Well i did trade today (monday) when the sunday candle finish, i set the S & R + the buy/stop and tp/stoploss.

Since it is too fast when it penetrates , i cant even modify my tp(5) to more. So for monday is it ok not to put tp?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
From what i know, monday movement is not the same all time round. And for tp, unless u babysit it else dont. Be happy every pips u earn even how small it is.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Thanks for the info. Well since for 0000 GMT my time will be GMT+8 i can babysit for a while.

How about big news?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I live in London - Still practising your method - On the daily chart where was the candle that you drew your lines on today -  Where would the candle show in my time GMT on metatrader please

--- 帖子 #629 ---
What was the high and the low of srdc 1 candle on gbp today please?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Could someone please tell what the exact times (GMT) the small Sunday bar candle begins and ends? This way we can all keep track of the move from 'open' to 'close' (so to speak) and have a good indication for the next 24H direction on whichever charts we are watching. Please use GMT, as it is the accepted world time. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thats what I am also trying to figure out -

--- 帖子 #632 ---
are you refering to the complete bar formation for today? If yes, its not over yet. 6 hrs more to go from the time i posting this.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
No I was refering to the Sunday candle that we would use to draw the high and low so we could get in on the action for Monday

--- 帖子 #634 ---
We are asking about the small, tiny Sunday candle that most charts don"t get. The one that  is supposed to give about 9 out of 10 good directional trades to going opposite this tiny bars open to close. In GMT time, what would the so called open time and close time be? Does anyone know....Please? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
"Sunday/Monday candle" and the "break below yesterday,s low is what I wanted to know as we are different in the United Kingdom GMT Of you could post a chart that would be great

Thanks

--- 帖子 #636 ---
I hope the question is not too bad.

Small recap of how I understand it.

daily chart:

Draw resistance & support line on the previous candle.

Enter trade if any of those lines are broken....

Question: Can I enter a trade anytime I see that it goes a certain way, or should I ONLY enter it when it hits either lines and not after that?

Should I confirm somehow of the direction for sure before entering?

I am asking because I entered long on GBPUSD, since the resistance was broken, but now of course it goes against me.

I am sure I am missing something.

Don't send me back to Endor please.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
PipSteve,

You draw your support/resistance lines at the high/low of the previous days candle but your entry point should be (as a rule of thumb) +1 pip + the spread.  So, if your support was at 1.9500 on the GBP and it broke the support line then your SellStop order should be sitting at 1.9500 + 1 pip + 4 pip spread (spread differs) or 1.9505.

cheers,

Jeff

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I hope I understand you correctly, and forgive me if I don't.

In your example I would enter the trade at 1.9505? I wait 5 pips to make sure it goes the right way?

What about enterring at other times in case I missed that first opportunity?

Thank you for your help and patience Jeff.

--- 帖子 #639 ---

Based on what I read, I am going in long now because the candle broke resistance, correct?

CCI also confirms long.

To dcoats and Mama007 hope this helps.

when im pointed my mouse at the sunday candle, the time and date was 2006.12.10 00:00GMT(for daily timeframe) and 2006.12.10 22:30GMT(for 1m to 30m timeframe).  the monday candle 2006.12.11 00:00GMT

I dont know if the sunday candle open time is correct or not.

For the S&R:

support:1.9524

resistance: 1.9549

oN METATRADER i DONT GET A SUNDAY CANDLE IT JUST GOES FROM FRIDAY TO MONDAY MORNING - VERY FRUSTRATING - CAN U TELL ME THE CLOSE AND OPEN OF MONDAY'S CANDLE PLEASE - TO CHECK WHERE I AM NOW ON MY CHART

THANKS

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I think the sunday candle depends on the broker.

Like master OrangeRoshan said (on previous post) just open an interbankfx demo for charting, and trade using your current broker.

Like ive post before, Monday daily opens at 00:00GMT. So like my timezone is GMT+8, it will be 8.00AM for me.

For Sunday candle to open, i think its around 22:00 - 22:30GMT.

might ask OrangeRoshan for this.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Thanks Balflear,

I guess it's just the hours before 00:00 GMT (if your Monday Daily bar opens at 00:00 GMT). Thanks again for your help.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi there OrangeRoshan,

I've found your method yesterday and i decided to try it on my ifbx live account today (12nd December 2006). I followed your method accordingly, but i need your clarification on this :-

As usual, at GMT 0000, that's 8.00 a.m. here in Malaysia, i looked at EurUsd Daily - hi  1.3265 , lo 1.3130 : I put on buy stop @ 1.3269 S/L 30 pips @ 1.3239 and T/P 5 pips @ 1.3274. But somehow, my stop-loss triggered and i lost 30 pips.

But my GbpUsd has gave me 5 pips, and by the time i 'm posting this, my Audusd is still in negative 13 pips from the buy stop order triggered.

Just want to have your view on this, how could i have been wrong in my eurusd position? Or it is just another usual thing to happened? Pls bro, i really need your advice on this..

Terima kasih.

Salam.

Your SL in EUR is too tight.

GBPUSD & EURUSD 50SL

AUDUSD 35SL

Sentiment change after th FOMC

Keep all trades until SL or TP is hit even until the next day.

When its following the trend, take TP highre than 5pips.

Losing trade 2day means winning tommorow. More win s than Losing.

Happy Pippin

--- 帖子 #651 ---
PipSteve,

I'm sorry for not responding earlier.  The chart you posted revolves around the Sunday candle and from the looks of it you played it just like I would.  The odds are that the Monday candle will always go opposite of the Sunday candle but I play them both way -- if, however, the price breaks the same direction as the Sunday candle I would recommend taking your quick profit, or locking in at least 5 pips with a stoploss.

And yes if the daily candle high is 1.9525 and the low is 1.9500 I would set my orders at 1.9530 and 1.9495 respectively, straddling the previous day's candle.

Hope that helps.

Cheers,

Jeff

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Thank you Jeff for the explanation. It sounds like you create 2 limit orders? I guess to make sure you are covered either way.

BTW, the SRDC journal is a great way to discuss those strategies. Between this amd TS, I should be able to full understand this system soon.

I am honered to be amongs all of you, even so my head is still spinning when I hear you (the group) talk about your analysis.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi there Orange,

Thank you for your explanation. Now i understand why my SL has been triggered. But only one thing is still not clear, you said that when its following the trend, take TP higher than 5 pips. Could you elaborate further on that? Another thing, how many position / lot should we open on one pair?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Yes ive agreed with you about the journal.

Im still a newbie and the journal gives a lot of info for me. Havent join the ts yet though.

Hopes that many high ranked jedi will help me in the futere.

All the best.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
From what I understand, if a trend is generally up.. use about 3 weeks ago against USD for example. Since the trend is strong up on gbp/usd and there is a break to the top from the previous days High, do not settle for just those 5 pips. Instead target 15-20 etc.

I am not certain if that is what Orange is getting at, just what I have been noticing. Best to go with the trend : ).

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hello Orangeroshan,

I am starting to feel the force.The force is strong i can feel it..Found your method last week. Backtest it for the first time yesterday and got close to 80 pips!! Quote from the master, "piptastic!!"

One question though, is it me or today ( 13/12/06 ). The market is kinda slow.

May the pips be with you.

LOL... I thought we are in a tread SRDC level 2.

What I've posted here are two charts put into one, so I don't have to switch between them, it's easier to spot the most important areas of decisions this way.  Everything else, is of course, OR's logic the way I understand him.

Well i did read the whole thread and fully understand SRDC lv1. Currently now trying to finish reading SRDC lv2 thread .

what i mean is that other newbies might get confused if they havent read the whole thread, or if they did read they will probably ask questions about your post if they assumed that your post is also SRDC lv1.

Yes im also still learning too, hope we can help each other.

I entered the AUD last night

H - .7888

L - .7837

Entry @ .7891 (spread +1)

High point of last night:  .7894

So, no PT hit and a big loss due to news this morning.

If anyone is doing this still?  Or is everyone over in SRDC II?

If anyone is doing this I'd like to know what was done wrong, if anything.  I just started this 2 nights ago and it seems breakeven.

What gives?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Well could be a couple of things. # 1 in 4X nothing is 100%, not really true the market will go up and down 100% of the time. If you see a flat line something is turned off.

#2 Not sure where you got h of .7888 it was more like .7876 and the low was .7832. But don't feel bad I still read the # wrong. Everybody does. Wait  till you put a trade in and are looking at the wrong chart. You will then feel the force of the dark side. Do a bunch of manual back testing to get a feel for what happens.

May the force be with you.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Lohr,

I am not sure how experienced you are but I can tell you that trading at newstime is very risky and the spread is increased by most brokers. SRDC 1 is alive and well even those that are involved with SRDC 2 will trade SRDC 1. Read the thread join TeamSpeak where all levels are welcome and if you are a beginner I would suggest that you check the news calendar and stay away from trading during major news announcements. I hope this help

Good luck

hI

Can anybody tell me which candle to use on a Tuesday to Friday -  I know on Monday you would use the sunday candle to set up for Monday.  But how do you progress for the rest of the week.  Is the closing candle for the previous day or what and is the daily chart or the 1 hr chart?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #670 ---
If you read the word document again, OrangeRoshan already stated that make 2 lines for S&R on previous daily candle.

So for example if today is Tuesday, so you should use Monday candle(previous daily candle). The lines is plotted on previous daily candle high and low.

the 1hr chart is for SRDC lv2.

Hi, orange i have been reading this forum for days.  I like your post, it has help me understand resistance and support which i can't reading professional ebooks.  Your explanation is very simple and I would like to try your system.  I am trading with a broker who has 10 pips spread.  Aside from that my broker also gets $70 commission per trade I do.  My deal with them cause they are the only local broker in our country. I would like to know how i can use your system on my broker.  Please do enlighten me.

Glenn; the EA is not avaiable, as you study you will learn why.

mjanep21; What country are you in you may want to consider moving. There is no reason to handicap yourself with those type of pip spreads and the commision should get your broker beat with a bunch of wet reeds, or whatever. There are ton's of threads around to help you find a broker.

That broker is such a rip-off. Get another.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi all, newbie here. I have not read every thread but I did read the beginning and I do not see anyone clearly answering the question that is lingering in my little head. The instructions for this trade say:

<DIR><DIR>Draw support and resistance on any of the previous bar. For newbies and JaJa Binks, Support is the lowest price of the candle and Resistance is the highest price of the candle. Draw horizontal lines.

Do you see the next candle penetrating the lines?

</DIR></DIR>a. YES: That’s your trade

Forgive the dumb q but what is my trade? In other words, how many daily candles are we looking at?  I know what support and resistance is, but what is being referred to in this trade?  Usually S and R are based on weeks or even months of charts but I do not see where you enter a trade based on one day of a candle going above (for going long) ....what? Above the previous day or the previous obvious resistance level? For resistance levels on a daily chart, I would think that the number could vary by quite a few pips since no resistance number is exact if you are basing it on the resistance level of say, a few weeks ago.  I hope there is a simple answer. Maybe someone could provide  a screen shot with example trade? Thanks!

Hi Brett,

You may want to read the thread. If you do, alot of your questions will be answered. When the daily support or resistance is broken that is your trade.

Yes, i am changing my broker but i have two open positions (float), very big negative balance. I need to get out from these positions first before I can change my broker.  I have allowed myself to be buried so deep in the soil.  I am hoping your system orange will help me.  Please do enlighten me.  Thank you so much

Brett,

Grandma says: You need to look at the previous completed candle on the Daily Chart ...no more ...no less. The rest as our padwan friend said.. read and your answers will be there.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Padawans and Grandmas,

Instead of answering all your questions, one at the time (I have 100s a week to answer, which is almost impossible), I will post this strategy, in the hope it will help you to understand it more clearly.

Have you ever trade level I, your trade reverses and hit your stoploss, long before you get your 5pips?

Well, welcome to the secret 10/10 winning 5pips trades, well almost.

With the strategy outlined here, you can harvest more than 5-100pips without worrying too much on your trade being reverse.

The secret is 15mins chart.

In this timefrane, the candles are drawn every 15mins, therefore filtering many bad trades. The Rules are:

- Donot enter immediatelly upon penetration of S&R

- Wait until the candle that penetrate the S&R to close

- See, when the next candle is fully formed outside the S&R

- Then when it does, Trade on the next opening.

- When it doesnt (maybe partly went back into S&R) then goto back to the first rule.

.S I M P L E.

Watch the chart provided below and understand the concept. When you can grasp it, then you dont have to worry me taking part of your account. When you still cant, then as usual, I will say. "I AM SORRY".

THE FIRST CHART

- The highlated candle is the Fully formed candle after the candle penetration of S&R

- Trade on the Candle shown by the Arrows

THE SECOND CHART
- Look at the Penetration of the Resistence (TOP). In 1hr chart, that would be a loss. But, with SRDC Advanced strategy Part I, you will avoid that trade because it doesnt comply with the rules.

May JajBinks sillyness be driven away from you!

Can someone here help me? I'm still confused with the Sunday candle.. which candle does that means? Is it the Friday or which one..

Thanks..

--- 帖子 #683 ---
It is the candel that runs 2 hours on Sunday Eastern time. Usally very small. Use the period separation (as instructed) on your charts and you will see it.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Do you mean before monday 0:00 GMt .. will be a sunday candle for two hours?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Thanks Orange, it is very simple and clear.

However, may I ask do we still need to add the Spread plus 1-2pips buff in this new ways ?

It seen I just cannot be a lazy boy just place a Buy Stop or Sell Stop order

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Thank you Master Roshan .. I will religiously follow your guidance.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
On daily charts, you can see the sunday candles in the InterbankFX platform, because it has bars that close/open at GMT+0. So it depends on that.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
thankyou teacher,

you are a beacon of hope for us

I am happy to say that i started using your SRDC 1 methods( demo on IBFX) and  eneterd only 1 lot per trade and now after 4 days i have made 691 dollars.

that is almost 70% return in 4 days.

15 pips a day may not seem much but they can go a long way i believe.

And this is minimum 15 pips because  for some reason my trail lock wont work other wise it could have been many many more.

lol, talk about a newbee here.

this post is to thankyou for giving me the confidence that is needed by every novice who ventures into this field.

this post is also to give hope to all the newbees that there is vey good potential in this system, although it has been only less than 10 trades.

The only worry was the stoploss being hit and negating many days of wins , but luckily it has not happened as of yet.

And now with the new advanced system there is a chance to avaoid that as well.

Thankyou master roshan, for shredding the darkness  with your jedi sword and showing us the path.

we are alll in debt to you, and this is only SRDC 1 !!!!!

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I looked at Interbank and what i see is the 3 hour period on Sunday before 00:00GMT would be the same as the Sunday Candle and sometime in August it changes to the 2 hour period on Sunday before 00:00 GMT. Must have something to do with savings time. But, i think you could just use whatever trading your charts show that begins Sunday and ends 00:00GMT and it would work as well.

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I know this is an old post but if pipraker is still around...

I am new here and reading through Orange's thread and found one of your posts.  Can I ask you about this?

Are you saying that if it was green the previous day, then you ONLY look to go long if the high is breached on the potential next day of trading?  Would you go short on the next day if it dipped below the previous day's low?

I am reading through the entire thread and am having trouble figuring out where everyone is taking profits on wins after the first 5 pips.  I would think that it best to take the first small profit with 1/2 lot and use the other half lot to ride a trailing stop of about 30 pips? What is everyone doing with that? I understand there may not be a consensus but I am just gathering information from those with more experience that myself.  Thanks!!

Brett

Dear Jedi's in Training,

Read this post carefully. Master Roshan is giving us a big clue of how to filter out the price movements and place ourselves into good trades. Yes, this post applies to daily highs and lows for SRDC  I method but it also applies to all trendline and support/resistance breaks.

Did you just have an Aha moment!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Hi All

I'm back and I have a little Xmas present for you

This is the first version of EA based on SRDC I Advanced method.

There's only few rules about this EA :

1) The EA will be release without list code (only executable .ex4) since I'd like to have full control of further development. Obviously you are free to use it anytime.

2) The EA will follow strictly the Master Orange SRDC Lev 1 rules as he write in this thread so please don't ask me for EA changes that are not related to his method.

3) Please don't ask me by pm neither by email for the list code or how EA it works, I will write here how it works.

Ok let's see the external parameters used by EA :

* EOD  = Time when the orders will be closed if neither the StopLoss or TakeProfit was reached

* Slippage = Max slippage accepted for each order opened

* TakeProfit = Takeprofit assigned for each order opened (in pips)

* StopLoss = StopLoss assigned for each order opened  (in pips)

* Lots = Lot assigned for each order opened (used only if UseMoneyManagement = false)

* UseMoneyManagement = Flag to let the EA to calculate automatically lot size based on Equity and Risk

* Risk = How much risk is applied for each order opened (used only if UseMoneyManagement=true)

* SundayCandleExists = Flag to tell the EA if the broker get the sunday candle in the chart (like FastBrokers, InterbankFX,..) or not (like NortFinance,etc,etc). In this way the EA if have to opens order on Monday will not take care about the high/low of sunday candle (if exists).
Note : Usually brokers aligned to gmt have the sunday candle, otherwise they don't

The timeframe for the EA is M15
The EA doesn't have to be used yet on live account with real money since it's in a first stage and have to be approved by our OrangeRoshan.

ok that's all, let's find best settings for this little baby

Great, thanks...Skyline

The advance version of SRDC is based on a 15 mins chart and using Daily High Low.

I think this is the reason why using 15 mins chart.  Please correct me if I were wrong..

Are the S&R lines based upon the 15m charts high and low?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi Guys

I think it's time to ask to Admin Merlin to open a new subforum (like Vegas and Mouteki), also for our Supreme Master Jedi OrangeRoshan , so that we can put over there all about his methods SRDC I , II and all indicators/EA, pdf manuals, Teamspeak audio chat and so on

What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I'm all for it a seperate area.

I'm just going over the advanced strategy for SRDC. Are we taking the trade off of the 15 min chart? Going by the pervious close of candle on the 15 chart?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
read the first couple of pages of this thread first especially the first post and it will give you the basics of the system. then you can move on to the advanced SRDC I.

this is because even though we break down to 15m TF, the original rules dont change.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Skyline,

I think there might be a small bug, the EA is closing the orders that I manually open. I am happy that this is a demo...

from my log file:

13:15:43 SRDC I Avdanced v1.0 GBPUSD,M15: close #4012256 buy 1.00 GBPUSD at 1.9631 sl: 1.9600 tp: 1.9640 at price 1.9627

13:20:38 SRDC I Avdanced v1.0 GBPUSD,M15: close #4012285 buy 2.00 GBPUSD at 1.9636 sl: 1.9600 tp: 1.9645 at price 1.9634

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Ok thx for reporting bug

I will add the magic number so to fix this issue

Edit : Anyway of course using this EA in a live account is your sole responsability , since as I stated this is a beta version and there could be bugs.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Here's new v1.1 with MagicNumber fix and Trailing Stop external variable

Hello All..

I'm trying to put this EA onto MT4. I saved it to the Experts folder, but when I look under Expert Advisor, there is nothing there.

Can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong?

Thank you...

Marc

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi Marc, did you restart MT4? When you did, you will notice that the EA appears gray, that's because the source code is not there, but you can move into your chart just fine. Let me know if you still have problems.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi Steve...

Yes, it's there..but how would I utilize the EA, I apoligize if this is elementry...

Thanks..

Marc

--- 帖子 #716 ---
No Problem Marc, we all started at some point. There is a lot of info in the Metatrader part of this forum.

But here we go:

Open a 15 min chart.

Double click on the EA in the Expert advisor part of the navigator on the left.

Select the common tab and exable live trading. Click OK.

you should now see a smiley face. If not, make sure that the expert advisor button in the top menu bar is enabled (green).

If you still have problems, PM me, and I will try to assist.

Hope this helps.

Thanks....

Hi Orange,

On the 15 minute chart for 12/21/06 with the 13:15GMT candle which closed below the daily low. On the next candle 13:30GMT the news out of the USD came out and moved the 13:30 GMT candle lower. Since we don't know which way the news will drive the price do we take the SRDC I trade when it happens as the news is released?

It's simple....use the EA

hi roshan thanks for sharing this great method

i have question for SRDC advance method

please look at the chart below ? where will you short cable is it in no 1 or 2 ?

http://img187.imageshack.us/my.php?image=srdc1qm1.jpg

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hi,

If the top red horizontal line is the S&R line and we observe what the Master says i.e.

"- See, when the next candle is fully formed outside the S&R

- Then when it does, Trade on the next opening. "

then you would NOT short on candle number 1 or 2.

You would short on the candle AFTER number 1.

If the S&R is the top light blue/white horzontal line, then you would short on the candle BEFORE number 1.

Remember, as a minimum target we seek to harvest 5 quality pips using this technique.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi all, with skyline's blessings i've created a simple page linked from our SRDC Resource Page. The direct link to the SRDC I advanced trade info page is here.

My open request is that i am informed of any updates that should be included in the page...this will be a great help to me keeping this info fresh and current.

Thank you skyline for your creative efforts!

Cheers,

Thank to you Thom for your help to organize in a better way all the amazing Orange's materials

Beats me how you got that. Using the same settings and test range I get 4 trades total (2 in April and 2 in November) for a profit of $628.30 on a $10,000 account. That's modelling Cable on a demo account supplied with MetaTrader 4.

Later: OK, I checked this using a period of 15 minutes on the calculations. Profit is $4,475 on a $10,000 account made in 13 trades. Still not great, considering the average trading competition winner is getting 130% a month. But it doesn't seem to ever lose on that currency pair, which is nice. It does lose badly on others.

hi granpa,

So basically this EA so far is testing 100% with no losses,

im just wondering if it's worth putting any stop loss just incase,

or do you guys think it's not necesary,

skyline what are your thoughts on the stop loss.

This Ea is looking very exciting, im going to run it on ibfx live with 1 cent per pip, see how it goes.

Hi exastris

Thank for answering my question

pls look at the chart below, so i should short on bar number 3 ?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi,

I'm not ready to take the advance SRDC 1 method. So currently still using the old ones. Anyway I've change the exit rules a bit. Instead of taking 5 pips i'm taking 20 pips. Since Master OR doesn't really fixed the the rules of taking profit and I've seen that in daily candlestick if it break the support or Resistance it normally go beyond that 20 pips. I only have 1 pending order depending on the direction of the daily chart. So again a litle deviation compares to the original SRDC. Does anybody do or see similar things like me?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I do, after a while it got more and more complicated. I dont know what was discussed at TS , not really sure how to use the 15m chart.If our Master OR is reading this i hope you can elaborate more on the 15m one.At the moment i only use the daily srdc 1 ..sigh...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
From my backtest even if EA is gain steadly and seems profitable without using stoploss, in the long run it leads to equity and margin call problem due to growing float loss. At some point the EA collapse and account is burned in a second ! So my advise is to find the best setting with the SL

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Hi all who have worked on this new SRDC I Advanced EA !! You guys really make FF the place to be ! Rock On !! And cheers <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City><st1lace>Orange</st1lace></st1:City> for your ideas.

I am seeing that it should open the trade above /below the previous day high/low, after the candle closes.

From my charts it opens the trade different than this.

Anyone else seeing what I am talking about ?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Thx GGR!

Pls post your chart (white background pls ) so that we can see what's wrong in your trade

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi,

If the top red line is S&R then yes, short on candle number 3. But don't forget why you are using the advanced technique. Please ensure that you understand post #690 in this thread before you consider trading real money http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=690.

In fact, I would recommend that you try a demo account until you are happy with your understanding of this technique.

Just a question Skyline - is the srdc s/r high low set at hour 23 or 0 ?

That might have been the problem with my observation !

I think the main issue is holding onto a trade that goes a long way against the desired direction to wait for 5 pips. And finding a happy place for the stop to be very important.

Skyline thankyou for your continued smart work with the ea's !

The obvious error is that you're using NO STOPS. One bad trade could wipe out your account totally. On the data I'm using (which seems to be different to yours) you would have been flattened on 3 August 12:00 , 10 August 18:00 , 17 August 16:00 , 1 September 16:00 and so on.

In fact the EA is faulty, since it's only trading on the hour. It's supposed to trade at the close of the second 15 minute candle outside yesterday's hi/lo range.

Lesson: Beware of amateur programmers.

Rob

LOL.... I know Skyline more than anyone here. Hes capable of designing worldclass commercial EA. Give him some credit for doing a free EA for everyone. The version he did was not meant to work with a live account but merely a confirmation how powerful SRDC method is.

I think this version automatically calculates the advanced strategy despite anytime frame use.

Stay Positive, as SRDC has many secrets right under everybody's nose. It defies normal trading rules and perceptions.

For public record ( and i've shared this many a time w/Skyline in PMs before!): Skyline's contribution in the way of EA programming is honest and profitable and appreciated by the FF community.

Orange, thx for the kudos toward Skyline.

Rob, welcome to FF. Hopefully you've taken a moment to read the forum rules? and just had a momentary laps of memory when you posted your flame? If it was intentional, you will most likely wear out your welcome here.

=====on a different note:

Last year's week was a fun week of trading for me (that was my first FX Christmas). So you never know what can happen. Take for instance this last Thanksgiving's trading, what a great week! I think the West (USA in particular) puts to much emphasis on some holidays expecting the world to stop and take notice. That said, i do recognize that since Christmas is celebrated by a vast majority in the USA and is a legal banking holiday...it's not just another "normal" trading day.

Like yourself spmaon, i will not be celebrating "Christmas" (or what i view as the Westernized non biblical take on it) on Monday. I'm a rebel and celebrate Christmas and Easter every day in my lifestyle and outlook.

Cheers,

Thom

Using the MIG Demo account supplies with MT4 build 200 from MetaQuotes, and on a 15 minute timeframe, there was no combination of settings I could find where the EA showed a profit on any pair over a long timeframe (> 3 months). So that shows we have different data sets, which is fairly odd.

To Orange: The EA was trading on the hour on H1 charts, which is not what you described in the advanced rules. I have no doubt Skyline will fix the problem once he tests it and finds this out for himself.

To Skyline and others: Please don't misconstrue a statement of fact as a flame, and we'll all get along famously. And yes, if I ever decide to code an EA for this or any other method it will be supplied to the group. At this stage I can't see the point, since Skyline is doing it.

Hi All,

I've reworked the DailyHL.mq4 program to make the code a lot cleaner. Attached is the replacement.

Wow, Master OR theres a part 2 for SRDC 1 advance?

Cant wait to see what the part 2 is.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I haven't to find out anything because as I stated in the EA first post , the EA is supposed to be used only on M15 timeframe since it follows SRDC Adv. rule.

Please Haiqu let's keep this thread as Orange intend to be , a funny and helpful place where we all togheter learn something from him, without jumping in and start to critizice others as you did with me.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
hai everybody,

I'm just wondering what happen to my chart (the black circled area). Is this what we call slippage. Am i entering at the right position?

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I'm using North finance just incase anyone are wondering. The reason i paste the chart is to seek whether I'm making the correct decission of entering trade and to know is this normal for a holiday trade...

thank in advance everyone..

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Still missing M15 setting..oohh where are you..!!

--- 帖子 #783 ---
For those using the EA, would like to check whether the trailing stop variable is working for you? I have tried using this trailing stop but it was never triggerred.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I need some comments on some of my results generated with the EA. I'm using the Metatrader Demo account for these testings.

I tried many different combination of SL, EOD and TP, but I just can't get the results many of you have achieved. Any advice?

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Your modelling quality is too low 47-48% :| You have to use Alpari data with 90% mod. quality (max possible value in strategy tester) to have some realiable result.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
sp I am trying to elp you but we must wait for a jedi for the answers. Your one hour looks like there was trading on Dec.25 all day.? I will wait with you for guidance. My charts just started running at about 1am US central time.

cant wait for the srdc advanced part 2

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi Haiqu,

You sounds like an experienced MT4 coder and I am interested in what you can do. Do you mind make a version of yours EA for SRDC I new strategy part 1 (post 690 in this thread)? We may have some interesting work for you.

On a side note, I backtested Skyline's EA in the tester and checked the result trade by trade, it seems following the rules of SRDC I Advance quite well (it does place trades on 15M bars (15, 30, 45, not just on 00)). The default stoploss setting is no stoploss, but I think skyline did not mean that's the best, he said he was looking for better settings.

aha

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hey Haiqu, Thanks, I will study this. Since you are comfortable with programming, could you make an SRDC I EA using the new strategy part 1. Many of us would love to help in back-testing & forward-testing on demo. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Yes definitelly Aha, you get my point

My intent was to share EA firstly to show how could be strong and realiable this SRDC method from Orange, then to find togheter (if possible) the best settings for EA. Sincerily I didn't take care so much at default settings when I posted it, nor I said in anyway to use it without SL or to use it on live account with real money

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I've also back tested Skyline's EA with same positive results as AHA.

Haiqu, to keep the cooperative spirit of the thread, it would be great if you could also, at anytime, share your EA in here.

Best,

Henry

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Skyline is an excellent programmer with an understanding of the Forex market and has done some great work on EA's.  With all respect the EA he released early in this thread is not very good.  It may look good in backtesting, but in forward testing it can get you into a trade in both directions and stop you out in both directions as well.  I forward tested it for two months and the results were poor.  I think Skyline would be the first to say that he did not spend much time tweaking this EA.  I think if he were to become excited about it again he could make it a great EA.

Thanks,

Bill

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi,

The black circled area is called a gap, something that sometimes occur when the markets are closed and the opening price afterwards starts somehow far away from the last close. In this ocassion, there was something more, Interbank was closed for the Holiday, but the market was opened in Asia, so there are some bars missing in the platform from the 25th of december.

Slippage is when you make an order and the broker makes the execution at a different price than the one you expected. This happens often with many brokers when there are news releases.

Hope I made myself clear.

Bye,

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Thx Bill for your words

Maybe you are speaking about my very first EA developed for SRDC method, yes you're right I know that one was not so much good because it was only an experiment then I was really busy and I wasn't able to continue to develop it and for this I have to apologize with you and other guys in this forum

Anyway now I'm back and as far as my work will let me I will develop this new advanced versions that our Master Orange will share us !

(Maybe I could integrate in one EA all SRDC I methods)

Cheers,

Skyline

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Thanks Skyline,

For the record, I never doubted you ability to write a successful EA and I was referring to the one released early in this thread for SRDC I.  I know you have written an EA based on parts of 1 and 2 for OR himself and from what I have heard, it is excellent.  I am glad you are back and look forward to what may be coming.  I have suggested perhaps some indicators based on SRDC I and I + using the 15 min. chart for entry, may be an alternative to a full blown EA.

Thanks,

Traderbill

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hi, Skyline

I've been testing your EA and my results always come up with 86.77% modelling quality and no losers.  Is this what you're seeing?

Thanks, Dan

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I think you still lack of data even if the value is quite near to 90%.

The Alpari data are complete and modelling quality have to be 90% for all timeframe excepted for M1 timeframe where max modelling quality could be 25%.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Thanks for the input, Skyline.  And thanks again for your work in putting this together, your efforts are very much appreciated.  I will go back and redownload the data and give it another try.

Hi bapxyz,

Actual I live in malaysia (GMT +8) and using North Finance as my broker. Yes NF does open the market during 25th here (Malaysia time). The rules of entering are the same as what we have been thought before. I guess I'm just a bit lucky that day when I open the short position. I'm still using the standard LRC channel provided in the MT4. Meaning my analysis is still manual . Looks like the market is a bit slow. Does now still a good time to apply SRDC 1 part 1? Or should I wait untill first or second week of Jan 07?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Fellow Padawans and Jedis:

A request coming from the TeamSpeak group:

Looking for the development of an  alarm indicator (not an EA) for  SRDC1 and SRDC 1+. This indicator would need to follow OR criteria.

We would really appreciate if one of our expert programmers would consider it.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Thanks for your advice, Skyline. Will try the testing again.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Happy Holidays to everyone.   I've been reading and learning about this method and I'm very excited.   It seems that someone made a reliable EA for SRDC I  but I can't find it.  Can someone tell me where it is?   Im on MT4 with Interbankfx.   Thank you.    I am so new, still using only  a demo and have lots to learn.   I love reading OR and everybody's comments.   Good trading in 2007!!

Here we go: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&postcount=720

But  I am wondering when this EA actually will get into a trade? I have used it for a while with not one trade yet.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
I would like to follow up on the request 4rex has made for the indicator.  In a recent Teamspeak session it was noted that most of us were sleeping or away from our computers when the price crossed the high or low of the previous day (SRDC I or I+) and we did not want to set a limit order ala SRDC I.  Our request is really very simple.  We would like an indicator that would tell us when we are nearing a possible break of the high or low but also one that would take into consideration the 15 min chart for SRDC I+.  It would be great if Skyline or someone who is already working with this type of code would help us out, but the invitation is for everyone.

Thanks,

Traderbill

hello guys , just to make sure

in srdc 1 we are still at the first advanced version right? the 15 min candle version posted by master roshan.

has there been any other advanced strategy added like orange said a few posts ago in #785?

just checking, as i am almost lost in the flood of posts in srdc1 and srdc 2, and master's post about the forex book poll, in which he says srdc1++ generating >50 pips per day

just confused

thanks.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hi Faddy,

The SRDC I is a separate method to the SRDC II. SRDC I is a simple breakout of either the daily high or low. OrangeRoshan posted the advanced part of SRDC I to help people make positive trades rather than to just jump in on a penetration of the high or low. I believe the advanced SRDC I says to wait for a close above the high or below the low. Then wait for the next candle to form outside of the high or low before placing a trade. This will increase your chances of having a positive trade.

SRDC II is an advanced method and is evolving everyday. I would suggest if you don't understand SRDC I then don't attempt to use SRDC II until you have learned the basics of SRDC I. SRDC II will just confuse you at this point.

In the SRDC I thread there are several post that talk about an EA - Expert Advisor. The EA is an auto trader that some people are testing out. I would not concern myself with that and I would concentrate of learning SRDC I and placing trades manually.

Hope that helps.

Happy New Year. I just wondering how the performance of SRDC 1 so far.

I also place trade manually. But last friday, EUR/USD picked the order but then hit my SL. Just wondering how other members are doing.

What is your percentage like so far...if you don't mind to share.

thanks for your reply dave.

i know that srdc I and II are different systems, and are on their own forums .

i was reffering to the additions OR has made to SRDC I, in which he introduced the 15 min filter, what i was wondering was if that was the only addition to srdc I or has there been some further enhancement like he said would be, a few posts ago.

i was confused by the term SRDC I ++ used by him

thanks for your help

Are there any forward tests of Skyline's latest EA on SRDC I? I have seen some promising back testing results and would be very interested in how it is taking trades and TP and SL's.

Thanks,

Traderbill

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hi shah,

I am usually at work when the new day starts so I don't get a chance to trade SRDC I that often after the weekend. I have spent much time in the teamspeak room and there are a few people there that are making pips consistantly with the break of the high or low of the day. My advice don't get too greedy and you can make 5-20 pips on the break when it occurs.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Hai Dave,

Thanks for the reply. I just trying to figure out, if the market reverse, what shall I do. Greed is not an issue yet cause my testing this on the demo but thanks for reminding me.

I used to read somewehere, when the market reverse, OR used to ride on it untill its turn positive. But I'm sure that are some other indicators that help him to make such a risky decision.

Thanks

shah

--- 帖子 #827 ---
DownunderDave  and Panjan,

Dave. ...  you wrote a good summary of  SRDC 1  Thank you... it was needed.

Panjan... I also saw that reversal on EurUsd too and if I recall correctly the 15 min  candle filter showed an upmove which later on reversed.  So hopefully this was one of the  very  very  few times where the SRDC 1  and its filter  gave a wrong signal.

To all...

If there is an update to SRDC 1   in addition to the  15mn candle  filter  please post forward.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Haha,

Welcome to this thread. I would recommend that you stick to the method as it is explained by OR in his first post. It is difficult to tell you without knowing what your spread was at the time of your trade. I am assuming that you are trading SRDC1 not SRDC1++(advanced)

--- 帖子 #831 ---
thanks for your reply, i am trading only SRDC 1. not anything else.. btw.. what kind of problem i will have if i continously trade only SRDC1 method only? what will happened if i only stuck at SRDC1? lol..

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Hi everyone.

I wish all of u a Happy New Year and may it rain pips where ever you are.

I have been studying both threads the past two weeks and have a question regarding srdc1.

In sdrc1 the first target is 5 pips above/below entry order. In sdrc advance we ad the 15 min filter. This means that if the filter is a reversal you lose out on the the first 5 pip TP, since u haven't traded.

Please correct me if i am wrong but it seems one must trade either one or the other but not both?

Regards Eben

"Please correct me if i am wrong but it seems one must trade either one or the other but not both"

Eben,

Your first comment is what I understand also.

Please clarify your second comment.

Lou

--- 帖子 #834 ---
nothing's wrong with 5 pips a day. you can double your account in little time using compounding. the success rate needs to be high enough to withstand the drawdowns however. For example, I set sell and buy stops above and below the high and low of the day, plus 5 pips, at about 22oo GMT (my bed-time!). I use a 50 pip stop loss. that's it! I then go off and have a life etc etc....

so far no losses, but I need 10:1 win:loss ration for this system to work.

we'll see!

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hmmm....  very interesting!   I take it that you are trading a real $ account.

three comments:

1.  I do not see anywhere in the SRDC  'rules'  that this is a straddle method. What I do see, in SRDC 1+  that you should stay up 16 minutes longer to determine the direction of the second 15 minute candle after the 'filter candle' -- which is the first 15 minute candle, which is used to determine the direction of the move.  Then put your trade set up on.

2. what type of leverage.. how many lots do you trade?

3.  Maybe you have hit on something with the straddle idea.  Would like to know how this has been working for you...  how many trades .. and how many successful trades... whatever info you care to share.

Lou

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Lou,

Thanks....I'll be looking for your point #1. b'coz I remember  I've read it somewhere in thread b4.

BTW, Lou, do you know whether the EA developed by skyline (v 2.1) handle this issue or not (checking thr 15m trend)?. I would love to depend on EA, but with big SL, it can wipe your whole winning trade.

Could anybody pls post their result on SRDC 1, so that we can be sure of the performance, at least for a newbie like me.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Oh that sounds strange Granpa, the EA seems to works properly in backtesting but to say all the truth I didn't put it in live forwarding test yet   . I think it's time to do this to see if there's some bug that backtest doesn't show

Did you check the History/Journal page to see if metatrader showed some kind of errors ?

thx

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi, Skyline

Hi there,

I have been following the SRDC forum since Sep-Oct last year and have read from begenning to end...

I haven't spoken out loud - I just wanted to see how things progressed.

I am currently testing out Skyline's new EA - I would also like to know how other people go with this EA.

I have no problem not having a stop loss on demo - but as Panjan said, it would be a bit of a worry with live trade. I am going to test this EA for a few months and see how it goes.

Keep posting guys, I got a good feeling about Skyline's new EA

Way to go mate!

Bradsta,

This is a trade I took following SRDC Adv. rules: (on cable btw)

http://img464.imageshack.us/img464/4796/cableix1.jpg

However, we see that it's not really going my way. What should I do? Hold on to it and see if it comes back up? Regularly i hold my trades until either my set TP or SL, but this time i was a little iffy at the beginning of the trade because the thin market during the closed Tokyo session didn't make me too comfortable.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #841 ---
ah, nevermind, the price is moving up as i type. this trade has really showed me the difference in mental stress in live trading from demo trading.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Panjan,  I originally thought  SRDC I  was a straddle method but the copy of the rules I have does not mention it.  Nor is it mentioned in my II  copy.  Sorry I cant help with EA  since I do not use metatrader.

Do let me know if you find out something else re  SRDC I

Thanks

Lou

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I'd like guys to clarify once for all that I didn't intend in anyway that EA SRDC I Adv. is to be used without S/L. It was my fault to put SL to 0 as default value, so please forget the SL to 0 settings and focus to find a SL that boost the EA in relation to TP.

The big challenge infact should be to find best settings with SL and with EOD (End of Day when all orders will be closed automatically by EA) set to 17 GMT (hour when price should close at its high/low) not set to 24 as most users did int their test.

I think also that most users misleading the use of EOD variable.

EOD isn't supposed to be when the hour when the day will come to end (24 pm) because this is not relevant for this EA. But EOD it's an hour (before the 24 pm) when all orders have to be closed automatically if neither SL or TP was reach and this has to happen before the 24pm.

This will avoid that orders will be carried over the next days because this EA is intended to close the orders in the same day when they are opened (that should be 17 gmt, 18 gmt and so on... but before 24 gmt).

Hope to clarify a bit

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Thanks Granpa, I am sure Skyline will work to improve it.  His work is good.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi Eben,

You are right, either trade SRDC I or SRDC I Advanced, not both. Use the one that suits you the most. The advanced method can filter the breakouts better, but you´ll have to wait for the signal (at least until the EA is perfected).

--- 帖子 #847 ---
I had a similar setup, went long @ 1949 got stopped @ 1980 (my M2 Pivot Point). Due to my J.O.B. I was not able to go short on the break of yesterday's low.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
ePIPhany,

I'm not sure whether you've read all the SRDC material. If you have done that, then is good because it is very important.

To my opinion, it is good to learn how to draw a channel on 15m and 1hr. For example, if the price were to break the daily high, I will refer to 15m channel to see whether the strenght is there for price to move up. If the price at Q1, I rather just take 5 pips with very tight stoploss. It's just the way I do it.

Pls verify my statement cause I could wrong though....

just my $0.02

regards,

shah

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Since it was a demo I just thought I'd go long on the break of yesterday's hi. Although I had reservations because FX Sniper was showing divergence.

I admit I haven't read every single post on this thread but I have read the majority of it. And the more I read I think the more I'm getting confused. For example, Channels, perhaps I missed some posts but do I use Equidistant Channels with simple trendline, SHI, LRC............

Regarding Q1, does SRDC I Advance use quadrants? I thought that was SRDC II. Although I have come across mention of referring to it.

Thanks for the $0.02 it's more than I made today.

For those of you who joined us in TS Room aka Pipville, thanks for another great trading day. If you missed it you can still get the highlights in here. OrangeRoshan took time to visit and teach us more about his awesome method. We started by trading "the channel" from quad. 1 down to the median and beyond. We later took our SRDC I trade, and after a little tense time for the newbies it paid off big. Trading SRDC I or advanced daily will guarantee you many pips. There may be a day you might lose but overalll you will be a big winner. We watched the news and took a few pips off the bounce. Everything we did today was taught in this thread and in the SRDC I thread for free. Please read the threads, the manual and then practice. Join us in the TS Trading Room and watch trades in action. We call our trades as we make them and then you can see that when say we made 40, 50 or 100 pips, we are telling the truth. It is the Rule in TS (call your trade if you are going to boast about your pips). It is not a contest, it is people helping others to be sure about their trades and to make sure that they consider everything before you push the button.

Join us in the SRDC Teamspeak room starting in London session and on into New York and beyond. Everyone is welcome!

epiphany,

The SRDC and SRDC Advance Strategy Part 1 do not incorporate anything else but the concept of the penetration of Support/Resistance and a trendline to help determine whether the trend is up/down/ranging. The SRDC method is explained on Master Orange Roshan's first post and SRDC Advanced Strategy Part 1 is available by going to post # 690 page 46. You don't need channels, fibs, or any other indicator except what OR prescribes. There are those who are more experienced and familiar with SRDC/SRDC2 that will apply more advanced strategies when they trade SRDC/advanced part 1 but this is not meant for beginners. Keep it simple for now read the thread several times if necessary and keep your chart clean and simple.

Only a suggestion that has helped others including myself.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Hey guys.. i have made a PDF file with all the OrangeRoshan important posts for me so i dont need to read all the thread everytime i need a refresh of the importants things.. this one is about the SDRC I.. i will do SDRC II later and i will post it in the other thread.. i Hope Some of u find it usefull....

In the SRDC advanced, should I still enter a trade if the candle that develops over the trend line is a candle in the reverse of the trend?

For example on cable:

--- 帖子 #857 ---
For those who have traded the SRDC I method before the advanced version, how do you compare the results? The original had the problem of dropping back before the 5 pip TP is met but the advanced has the problem of possible exhaustion after the new 15 minute candle is completely formed.

In the end, which is the bigger problem and is the advanced method really better?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
I think that the original SRDC trade might be better - Take your 5 pips and run. You have to have very tight spread like efx or oanda. And if the original SRDC trade happens to go against you by "X" no pips (say 20) you trade in the opposite direction - think it might be hard to nake EA to do this - better with manual trade.

Just my thoughts (I am a new to fx)

Kind Regards,

GGR

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I've had over 10 wins in a row with simple SRDC1, high/low plus spread plus 1. problem is InterbankFX keeps quoting a 4 pip spread despite claiming it is 3 for GBPUSD. Makes me feel pillaged and violated it does.

In teh spirit of KISS though I'm just going to stick with manual SRDC1 as other methods I just suck at. Will gradually increase the lot size and be happy with 5 pips per day at 10lots!

Any thoughts on stop loss levels for cable with SRDC1? I use 50 presenrtly as per OR's document but with bigger lots if the SL is hit could be a massive drawdown.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
yeah i think with srdc you take you 5 pips first and foremost, and then u can let it run  if u want more pips.

i had 14 wins and one loss with srdc I, and the one loss was on usd/chf which is not recommended.

made 90% ROI in 14 days

too bad it was just demo....

Also i felt it was a clear case of stop hunting as the price was nowhere on the charts on any platform but i got stopped out.

so in my opinion gbp and usd are the safest, cause of the daily range > 100 pips.

SRDC II, now that is turning out to be much more profitable for people but i am really confused with it.

take care

Hello my Fellow Padawans:

We now have, a channel in TeamSpeak that will be available to discuss the SRDC and SRDC Advanced Part 1. This will be the only method discussed and beginners are most welcome to join in. It is recommended that you read the SRDC thread first so that our discussions can focus of finetuning your trades. I have volunteered along with other members of TS to help out whenever possible. We are planning to be in the TS room at the start of the new Daily Candle (7pm est) and at those critical moments when we are close to breaking the Support/Resistance level.  If there is anyone else that wants to volunteer to serve as host/moderator or has any suggestions please contact TraderBill or Preacher165.

C U THERE

Matty,

That´s very cool, thank you.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Good Job Matiasfx!!

This is a great tool for someone just coming into SRDC and those of us that need a refresher course every so often.  Much easier to read.

There sure are a great group of traders here in SRDC I and SRDC II threads that are willing to help each other.  I am glad to be a part of this group.

Join in Teamspeak when you can.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hey Matty nice work, it is now also listed at our resource page!

Remember one and all, let me know if you have an SRDC goodie that you believe will help the gang and it will be posted for all at the RP.

Hi All, I am newbie to the forex. I am using mettrader 4 for charting. can anyone tell me how to use & understand the trend line.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
If you missed joining the SRDC Teamspeak room aka "Pipville" today, you missed a fantastic session. Once again we traded SRDC I and made more pips than yesterday. This method again proved it is one of the most winning in the Forex world. We were also able to take some money from the news of the day because we had faith in the channel and understood where we were heading after the news release. OrangeRoshan is now in the room and is once again helping us to stay focused and follow the method correctly every time. I am very proud of the people in the room today. We worked very well together and so many contributed to the success of the entire room. We welcome everyone to join us again tomorrow and see what happens.

Good question Lamdun.  We had users using both methods, but I think most went with SRDC I because the price was moving straight down and quickly.

Todays trading in the Teamspeak room was a little more difficult than usual. We started the day by taking an early SRDC I trade and most of the users had between 20 and 40 pips in the bank before the day had begun. Some users, myself included, decided to trade SRDC Advanced and that one took much longer and lots of patience to pay off, but it did. The day was not perfect and the people in TS are honest and want everyone to know the good, and the bad. Many of us took a retracement trade going long (against trend) based on good indicators. The candles were right and all time frames seemed to point to that retracement. There were some pips made but there were also some given back. It certainly was not the thrilling day we had one month ago on that Non Farm Payroll day. I am proud of the users in TS and win or lose today you can bet they are planning for a great week ahead, and you know what? It will be a great week ahead because we have the method and we have the people.

On a sad note, there were two users that were banned from TS today for bad behavior and disrupting the rest of the room. This was the first time I have had to use this measure but I can assure you I will do it again to protect the serious traders in our room. Newbie and Seasoned Trader, all those who come into the TS room deserve to have a good day of trading and learning without being hassled by a few.

Good luck and see you next week,

Traderbill

Hi guys,

OK, here's my contribution to the SRDC method. After some testing I am declaring its use on shorter timeframes a howling success. My variation - which Orange Roshan called "SRDC I Advanced Strategy Part 5" when jest1081 preempted it earlier in the week (see SRDC II thread), but which I had developed independently prior to that - consists of using the attached custom indicator interactively. Really good for you guys who like scalping.

Watch the pair of your choice, and when the candle breaks the 4-hour line - either up or down - switch to the 5 minute charts. If a new candle is formed completely outside the indicator's lines, bid in the direction it went. i.e. if we went out the top, buy and if we went out the bottom, sell. You can easily make 5-10 pips here, often more. Check back on your charts to see the types of breakout that can occur, and study them well.

Practical application tells me that if the breakout is violent, it is likely that the majority of it will be in that first breakout candle and you should be cautious. But in normal trading conditions, a breakout over the 4-hourly will usually make you some pips. The usual warnings about news events should be heeded, of course.

Enjoy!

Rob

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Hi Henry,

(Also to cbrock5000 and aha) I haven't written an EA for SRDC I and have no plans to do so. My testing of Skyline's EA confirms that it's a marginal system which only works on a highly tuned set of parameters. See the above post for a 4-hour variation that's a bit more useful.

Thanks,

Rob

p.s. If any admin can tell me how to disable the automatic subscription to the forum digest every time I post a message, I'd be eternally grateful. :-)

--- 帖子 #876 ---
No problemo. I have now changed it again, so that the median (average) line can be turned off. Attached.

Rob

--- 帖子 #877 ---
haiqu- i thought that your 4hr method was using the 4hr hi/lows instead of the daily hi/lows. But your indicator is using the daily ones. If so, from what I understand, isn't it basically just the daily SRDC advanced method but using the 5 minute candles to confirm the breakout instead of the 15 minute candles?

--- 帖子 #878 ---
I havent taken a look at it yet, but yes, it should be using 4hr Hilo...I have one version of the 4hr hilo, programmed for me by Aha, but the prob is everytime a new 4hr candle forms, the lines just multiply.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I posted TWO indicators today. One was the four-hourly and the other was a revised daily. Go back one page.

Rob

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Accrete, sorry for the noob qn,

we can use two of these indicators on the same chart right?

--- 帖子 #881 ---
As long as they have a different name, is my guess. For instance, you can run HiLoAvg.mq4 and HiLoH4.mq4 together. Of course, you'll need to change the colo(u)r to something different if using a modified version.

Rob

So I'm wondering, how do those who use limit orders for SRDC 1 deal with variable spreads?

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Haiqu,

Interesting stuff but where are you going with these alterations and should these discussions be in the MT4 thread instead? It seems to me that for those who are trying to follow the methods taught by OR(especially the beginners) that your research and development of new indicators can be confusing and distracting. Have you consulted with OR about this?

ALL 4 1 AND 1 4 ALL

Rob

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Rob, 4rex and all,

First, I hope you will reconsider leaving our threads Rob as I think you have much to offer. 4rex, you know I think you are one of the best. I don't think anything was meant in anger or disrespect from either side here. OrangeRoshan has created two new threads for SRDC. One for discussion and posts of EA's and one for discussion and posts of indicators. I believe this will allow both SRDC I and SRDC II threads to stay on message.

We need to get back to the fun attitude that has been a tone of the threads till now. We are all working towards a common goal. Let's get there.

Rob, I don't think you would ever find a post deleted by OR unless it broke the thread rules in one way or another. I have seen posts critical of members, including Orange allowed to remain as long as they were not too nasty in tone. That is his rule from the beginning and it works. If you knew 4rex you would understand he is one of the nicest people in FF and really made the comment for the good of the thread and perhaps we should have had these other threads earlier but OR can't do everything.

Hope you stay,

Bill

A minor disturbance in the force ....  (for me).

Trading SRDC I does employ the straddle method.  Previous daily candle.

What then is the reason to look at the first and second 15 minute candles into the new day and thereby use them as a filter?

Lou

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Gys,

Still remember, OR has mentioned before about the 'sunday bar'? We've a bearish daily bar for sunday.. I will go long with my demo just yet.

We'll see....IT's interesting isn't it?

Closed position for 20pips. Not bad for monday.

Thanks OR.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
For those of you who use the SRDC 1 as a straddle technique, is there anything that helps you decide whether or not to set the limit order in a certain direction? As in - are there any factors that might make you only set a sell limit order instead of limit orders in both directions?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #893 ---
My I ask what pair and what time does your daily bar close?  Mine closes at 5pm New York time, and my test yesterday didn't work out that great.

Going to assume it's just an non-normal day and will try again tonight. Also I made the mistake of not adding the spread, which would've prevented the order from even going through!

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Techno79,

I took GBP/USD and I'm using InterbankFx which bar closed (gmt 00) or at 8am Malaysia time (Gmt +8). I long at 9310...but I hate my guts though. Got out early. Tonight it reached 9400...too bad, that just me...

Hope it helps.

I have an idea which I hadn't seen mentioned or posted yet, although I haven't finished getting through the entire thread yet.  I think most people have a small Sunday candle .  My broker closes at 4:30pm* Friday, and opens around this time or 5pm* Sunday.  Therefore I have no real Sunday candle, I'm using last Friday's candle.  I am unsure how this effects the system but will have to keep a close eye on Sunday's.

1.9262 was the low of Friday on my broker, and we hit 1.9261 at sometime during the Asian open and reversed.

I'm happy with this theory for the time being...

*All times New York timezone

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Techno,

Just open a demo account with IBfx (for Sunday bar) then trade live with the broker you're using now.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
It is still the DAILY candle, but entry and exit is put using 15mins to make them more precise. The reason for the filter is MARKET SENTIMENT. It confirms the move and will mostly to continue.

OR

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Never enter the market with the hope of getting maximum pips possible. Have a clear goal on how many pips you want to get for the day.

Another thing is also, SRDC II channel can help to iddentify the direction of the breakouts.

OR

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Hi Team,

Its been a very good day for SRDC I traders. Today's candle is exactly the opposite of the Sunday's candle. It penetrated both the Resistence and Support.

I hope you guys didnt forget to get into this trade?

OR

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Thanks for posting that photo/chart.  I'm missing that small Sunday bar which gave you two entries.  But you'll notice how the low on Monday and Friday were almost equal.  I'm thinking that could've been another breakout possibly if it penetrated(which technically I have no entries today, but tonight!).  Doing a quick look at two Sunday/Monday's in early December, I think it still worked this way.

Which has me wondering if more than one entry is possible, especially on the first trading day of the week.

I am getting very very ahead of myself, as usual.  I am just happy to see how the results of this week will go.  I've enjoyed reading a lot of the posts. This does look very intersting.  I will keep a watch on my theory, unless someone did beat me to it.

Also on my charts, we may have bounced off the 23.6% fibo.

Thank you Begajul, I tried media player and it worked. Just curious what 's up with winamp and wav format.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
crazy on the .wav formatt. Mine plays in both win amp and WMPlayer from the site download. guess my machine has some codex already on them?? I've done nothing to them to tweak the audio playback features. The reason i go with the wave file is i can compress them even a bit further down than the original .mp3 file that was sent to my by Pablo/ptejerina. His file was 6.47 and the one i uploaded after a quick post edit/compression was 6.07 set to 16kBit / 16KHz / Mono / 1kb/sec sampling

You can download this free utility http://www.headbands.com/gspot/ to check the missing codec & download it for you. Or you can download http://www.free-codecs.com/download/...Codec_Pack.htm which has nearly all the codecs available.

cbrock5000,

Just keeping it simple.

5 pip target.

My main concern lies with the 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 trades that results in a  loss - it can wipe out 10 profit trades based on 50 pip SL.

In SRDC ADV (EA by Skyline) Honourable Orange Roshan was pointing to the 2nd closed candle above S or R for entry.

I am still liking the original SRDC a bit better (immediate S or R break per SRDC instruction)

I am still looking for filter for the 1 in 10 /1 in 20 trades that goes results in a loss.

Any Ideas ?

It's the 6 Million dollar question !

Cheers,

GGR

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Keep watching the 'price action' when they are about break the daily high/low. You might get the answer and you might not need 50SL.

I've been having a good time on this system so far this week.  But I'm concerned about the stop losses too.  I'm trying to figure out how wide the swings are until the take profit is reached.  As my trades are being executed at the start of Asian, there aren't many huge swings then, so unless it takes 5 hours to get 5 pips, I feel relatively safe

Also, as it's my first full week working on this, I feel werid like I'm missing something.  Maybe it's because it's the only system that I currently use where the trade executes and closes without me sitting here.

But anyway, I'm worried the last two days aren't perfectly normal since England had 2 medium economic reports the last 2 days.    Today being Consumer Confidence Index.

I want to update at the end of the week because I'm trying to keep some uninteresting statistics on how it's going.  And I also tried to demo a crosspair, but I became stopped out by not factoring the spread right on my stoploss.  It looks like it would've worked too.  Instead it closed after 36 seconds by not doing the order right.  Squeeze five pips out of enough pairs, you get more than 5 pips!

--- 帖子 #917 ---
To me 5pips/day is good enough. Imagine if buy $80/pip then 5*$80 = $400 already per day. That is the average salary of CEO of Big Company in my country.

But if you want double to $800 per day then buy GBP/USD and EUR/USD...

Man...that's a lot..

That's all I need anyway...

Positively pips,

shah

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Good point about the SL but I only trade SRDC I manually so I average more than 5 pips.  Unless the price moves directly to your take profit it could present some problems.  Most times when a new low or high is made for the day, it will back up some before continuing  the run.  If your stop is not set far enough back then you are stopped out.  By being there you can judge the market and if you move to 15 pips profit, you can then set your SL at 5 profit and let it run or just take the 15.

Good Luck,

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Hai Guys/Gal,

Would it be possible to modify the EA to set a move to break even and lock X pips?

So for example it moves 10 pips and you set your move to break even at 5 and it would add the lock 5 pips. You would be 10 pips from open but would have secured your 5 pips. All the others is just a bonus with a trail.

Another idea is to have a take out lots. You place a stop with 2 lots. It takes one out a 5 pips and you could either let the other run or set a second take profit level on it.

Thanks for the consideration!

First up i have to say u gotta love srdcI, it is simple and effective. For the past few days it has been quick as well with the trade over in a few min after the gmt open. My thanks again to the jedi master who has taken along soooo many people on a great journey.

Master can I request one thing? in  days such as the past few, where the channels were beyond even some of the more accomplished jedi's and everyone was waiting and waiting, and waiting for something to happen, do you have a simple sort of SRDC Scalping technique that can be used by padwans as well?. Just so that some pips 5-10 can be made ? i think many do it regularly and i thought that i will ask the master himself. If this is not appropriate to ask i apologize in advance, just that SRDC I is great and II is a bit tough for many to fully comprehend .

just a thought anyways,

again i apologize if it has been mentioned before, or i have done anything wrong in any way

thanks for your teaching and patience and above all your genuine goodwill

Hi, awesome forum you have here, I just started to get into Forex again, and actually want to be successful enough to open a mini account. I've tried a few different strategies, but I haven't found one that I like yet. I was trying to do the SRDC technique, but I'm having some problems.

Do you put a limit on your orders, or do you use a trailing stop loss, I'm not sure when to take profit and how much to take? I read in the SRDC doc that you put a stop 20-30 pips above your entry, would I have to have a limit of at least (stoploss + spread + 1/2 pips)to break even, or win most of my trades. Can you go in the trade anytime of the day using the previous candlestick? Here's is a picture of my attempt at the SRDC method

On the EUR/USD: (Daily Chart)

Entry/Sell Order at 1.2925

Stop loss at 1.2950

Limit at 1.2895 (not sure if this is right)

hi guys,

I think some of you knw my unfortunate adventure. I was reading up this thread and I thought I could follow it through, anyone have the final version of the indicator (if have), and so I can give it a shot.

I don't know, but somehow God pointed me to this thread (is it the most profitable trading system?!? Probably!). I've lost a total of 5,000 USD if you have read from the Journal section.

I will be started out with demo (again), and if I can do this SRDC with consistency, I will be right back into the market without much hesitation.

I'm recovering, with a better mindset. Discipline, yes, I've paid my due for this attribute.

Thanks guys.

I need some advice here. I had my first losing trade today with SRDC I, and it really shouldn't have been. I had my order entry just above yesterday's resistance at 1.9426, with my profit target at 1.9436 for my usual 10 pips. Upon arising this morning, I saw the news about the interest rate hike before I got a chance to log into my account. There was talk about the huge surge in the GPD/USD, so I was expecting to see another nice gain in my account. Unfortunately, that was not to be the case. Due to the price gap, my order was opened at 1.9474, but because my TP was set at 1.9436, I was immediately closed out for a 38 pip loss, on 3 lots. This wiped out all my earnings for the week, plus some.

Is there a way to set my orders where this doesn't happen to me in the future? Prices moved positively for me, but it was the way the order was set up that cost me. Any suggestions or help on how to avoid this problem would be greatly appreciated. Had prices moved up to my order entry and then backed down 50 points, I could live with the fact that prices just didn't go my way. However, that was not the case with the loss this morning. Prices did go my way and they went there big time, but I still managed to come away with a huge loss.

Hopefully there is a better way to enter my orders and someone can point me in the right direction.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
In looking closer at this, there doesn't appear to have been any gap in prices. My 50 point gap open was simply slippage. I understand that there was some big news, but I feel like I got robbed today. Xpresstrade didn't even attempt to work with me on this trade. I think I should have had a 10 pip gain and not a 38 pip loss. Are there other brokers that guarantee no slippage, or is this issue just one of the issues you have to live with while trading forex, or is there a better way to enter my orders?

Again, my buy order was set for 1.9426 and I got filled at 1.9474. A 48 point difference!  Did this happen to anyone else that was trading SRDC today?

Any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
I am sorry to hear this man.

As I am new to this system, I would also like to know the correct way of placing orders with it.

OR stated that you start with a stop buy or stop sell to initiate the trade.....but is this the right way of doing it ? And how do you set up an exit for the stop buy, and how do you do it for a stop sell ?

I tought that stop buys and stop sells where done to exit winning trades, not initiating them.....I am confused

Thanks

Hi Mccullek,

My SRDC1 order got filled properly ny InterbankFx. Can you specify a maximum slippage in your trade platform? That would cause the intial order to have been rejected.

Hi, everybody.Just wanted to thank you all guy in this forum especialy our master JEDI.What am making in my demo in 2weeks is what i would make in 1 year on my JOB  .MASTER OR, about that your book, is it out yet?

--- 帖子 #948 ---
My demo processed it right.  Got 5 pips out of a 140 spike.  Or whatever it was.  But how knows how accurate that is in live trading, I've been wondering.

I'm amazed you didn't get a requote or rejection.  I also don't get how they opened your trade HIGHER than the stoploss order, and filled both.  That sounds fishy.  To open a stop loss, the stoploss is lower than the order.  Therefore the order has to be done before, not after the stoploss is hit.  It's sequential not backwards.  Unless you had a trailing stoploss automatically set.  You see what I'm saying?  It sounds like they executed the stop before the order in a roundabout way.  What was the duration of your trade?  5 seconds?  Somehow my demo says it took 1:30minutes to fulfill the five pips.  I'm sure they wouldn't be so generious live however.

I don't have a gap, just a gigantic bar.  That's what worries me about hitting the news.  I'd be fine if the order just gets voided.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
happened something similar to me, in fxdd mt4. I simply didn t have the order placed. Can someone explain me exactely what s slippage? thanks.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Forget about it...now I got it....still I do not understand why my trades last night where open in aa strange way.

I basically placed a stop buy 5 pips above yesterday's close, and then a sell limit 5 pips above it. Yet, I woke up with two trades open, each going in the opposite direction with the same number of pips.......oh wait, is it because when I placed the 5 pip difference between the two, it wsn't enough 'cause I did not take into consideration spread ?????

Ouch !

--- 帖子 #951 ---
I was set at 1.9425 also.  You got filled at 1.9474.

The 2 15 minute candles at the announcement topped off at 1.9535.  That's 61 pips until a retrace back to around 1.9500 and continueing down.

You were closed for a 38 pip loss you said.  38 pips minus 1.9474 is 1.9436 which was hit at about 10am, 13 15minute bars later.

Unless they retroactively initiated your stop order before they opened your order and filled them both instantaniously...which would mean they went BACKWARDS as the price was going UP and not DOWN from your fill, you either left it open for that long, or something fishy IMO.

Numbers go in order.  To get from 5 to 10 you must pass through 7.  5,6,7,8,9,10.  You can't randomly skip, 5,6,10,7,11,12,13 which your story sounds like.  How can they do that?  What was your timestamps?

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Rick, Xpresstrade does not have any way to specify a minimum slippage. I went back and reviewed my trade, and with their system, there was absolutely no way to avoid a loss here. Basically what happened was this: they opened my trade 50 points above my entry order. This surpassed my target profit by 38 pips, so because the TP was met, it closed the trade. Unfortunately for me, that created an instant loss of 38 pips.

Because of the order entry options, there was no way I could avoid this loss by entering my orders differently. It's a flaw in their entry system. With a no slippage guarantee, it wouldn't be an issue, and that's what they had up until a few weeks ago when they moved away from the dealing desk. Now that they have a no dealing desk set up, they need to change their platform to account for the slippage. The most slippage I have had since they changed the system was a pip or two. I never imagined a 50 point difference, so I didn't really realize that this kind of trade could happen to me. Unfortunately, an education can be expensive.

I'm still complaining to Xpresstrade, and I'm waiting on a call from a supervisor. If they are going to allow 50 points in slippage, they have to change their platform so that you can account for this in your orders. What should happen is that if you get 50 points slippage in your entry, they should automatically move your TP 50 points as well, or at least have some way to void the entry if the slippage is over X amount of points as you suggested. I guarantee you that they robbed a lot of people on this move today!

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Limit orders below the market are filled instantly. Because I was opened so far above the market, my limit order was immediately activated. My trade opened and immediately was closed. Even if I had entered a regular buy order, I still would have had a losing trade, because my buy order would still have been below my entry price. It's a flaw in their system and if they don't credit it back to me, I will find a new broker today.

Can anyone recommend an honest broker that has a no slippage guarantee, preferably one that uses MT4?

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Oooohhhh.  I understand now.  They executed your take profit(which was a loss) immediately and not the stop loss.  I'm sorry.  Not sure what to say except how many events turn into a 100pip spike?  Maybe only a few days a month.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
I am sorry my friend but you have just experienced what everyone has or will at one time if they trade during major news. You were filled at market price not the price you selected. That is to say, you were filled where they wanted to fill you. Slippage during news time is a given. You should learn from this and realize that you have to be aware of fundamentals as well as technicals. I do not like to trade SRDC I without being there to make the trade. A good percentage of the time your price will back off of the new daily high or low and sometimes it can trail back 30 pips or more, only to end up in profit later. This is why you have to watch the trade and judge the market as it is on that day. Join us in the SRDC Teamspeak room to get some coaching from the best traders in the thread and OrangeRoshan himself.

Master OR,

I was in TS this morning when you spoke about the tendency of some of us to focus on SRDC2 while not realizing that the method is a dance that includes all three methods. I think that there is an inclination in most of our minds that more complexity leads to greater success yet I have found (the hard way) that is not necessarily true especially when you are reaching beyond your capabilities. These three methods you made it clear are to be used in accordance with what the market is doing in the "here and now"; that is my understanding of price action and everything else falls in the field of probabilities. Ok, sorry... for the perhaps obvious but maybe this will be helpful to others.

One more thing...I need one clarification.... if one starts out with an SRDC1 entry, you make your 5 or so pips can one then follow that with the SRDC 1 advanced? Someone in TS was even suggesting that you could place two separate orders to accomplish the same. How do you see it? And can you perhaps elaborate a bit on how this three methods work in unison.

I never get tired of thanking you for your patience and willingness to help the padawans that are committed to your teachings.

I just like to throw my 2 pips for the n00bs

FF is the best place to learn fx.

When you are doing real account and after a long day of trading, sometimes no sleep days ( i have had those),

coming here and reading ( you have to be patient and read every letter and sentence if you are a newb),  one can learn a lot.

I mean I hope FF get their money worth....i would even pay to get to FF.

the best fx community ever.

Even if all system do not work 100% of the time, all system combined will yield a very gpipastic result.

ofcourse one has to read read test test read again- dont think you will be a millionaire overnight with one system

its a gold rush- but i now beleive chaos (fx) can be mastered....it is not chaos after all, it is a game and human psycology displayed on charts ( thanx to computers that can think for us fast)

Hi,

Just wanted to know. Is the current system still the same as it is described in the document in post 1?

Which post has the EA that best trades accordingly to the document on post1?

The thread has become very big. Your help will be appreciated.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Yes and it has advanced to SRDC II.

System is basic and remains the same. Straddle on both sides ( cancel the othe uppon entry on one).. uppon +fewpips + spread, to get 5 or so pips..

other indicators are to be used as conformation...such as MA and channel, fibs if you want(since most ppl take TP @ that point...u can use that also as a variable in your calculation to enter/ exit..

but yes every thing remains the same...but with few added suggestions-

you have to read it tho- it is not a waste...though most of it is also dealing with EA much more- since the syst is simple to humans ( cEA is a different matter)-

one day we will come up with AI ( artificial intel... )

Anyone else get stopped out? Just came on the computer to check the logs.  2 pips away from T/P.

Trying to look around and am not figureing out why it did a reverse the way it just did.  It should be a short after no interest change right?  Or maybe I should've waited a few more hours to enter the order?

I wonder if any other brokers did hit 1.2873.  My other chart doesn't look like I would've ever entered the trade.

I use O an da  to trade.  They have 3 hr candles.  Thinking of OR's idea to look to the last 6 candles (on hourly)  that would equal 2  3hr candles on the O an da  platform.  Use S/R  lines based on those 2 candles.

Would like to know if anyone else is looking at this?

I'm still in SRDC I on the UsdJpy at 120.62 and counting, as i post it is doing a bit of retracement off the 120.68 Asian high at GMT 06:00. I'll let it ride for a bit and see what takes place as it has already bounced up from the Median 1hr trend line so it looks like a safe buy for now without news in the way. . . i've got TP in and i'm heading out for a cat nap before London Open.

i didn't take the trade, but yes it would have been a loser today.

i think OR said to be careful if price is at some significant low point and yesterday's low was the lowest point since 22nd november 06. So a bit tricky.

thats what i think but maybe OR or other jedi's can shed some  light.

I checked the dailies last night and didn't really notice that resistance.  I see it now though, the line is a little sloppy.  Don't trade euro-dollar much(though I should).  Oops.

Least I finally found a way to play with USD/YEN, all my other methods were immune to it before.

Cable likes to do what it should, worried about it activating during newstimes though.  Maybe it was just because it was an interest week.

My demo results of set and forget(except one trade).

Mon:  Cable +5

Tues:  Cable +5, 2:45min;  Jpy +10 17min(let it ride manual); Euro +5 6min

Wed:  Cable +5 90second, YEN +5 12 minutes;  euro no trade

Thursday:  Pound +5 2 minutes; Euro -15 49minutes(asian session); YEN +5 20minutes

Total for my 5pip set and forget, except for yen that I watched and dragged on, 30pips.    Very nice.

My only concern is if there's a retracement prior to my T/P, how far back will it go on average.  Without a large account I don't want to margin out of a trade.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Roshan you are a star!

Seriously, I have been trading full-time for 18 months now and only recently stumbled across this forum.

I spent about 8 hours reading all the messages in the thread.  Some of it was irrelevant for me as I don't use MetaTrader but your principles are very sound.

It made me realise I have been relying more and more on indicators and my performance has been deteriorating.  Yet what do traders on the floor use?  They don't have Fibs and Stochastics, they trade on price and volume, that's it!

So I stripped out all the indicators and practiced your SDRC 1 part 2.

Not having software that provides backtesting, I did a lot manually, going down to 1 minute charts to be sure that stops weren't being hit.

Today, based on your Mondays and Fridays recommendation, I traded for the first time, on the GBP.  In at 1.9550.  Out at 1.9585 for a 35-pip profit.  I used a stochastic crossover (10,6,6) for the exit because that's what I'm used to but might adapt that.  One thing I noticed is that once support/resistance is broken, if the stock hasn't taken off within about 5 bars it probably won't, so I will be looking at time as a possible addition to the stop/loss.  It sort of supports your statement that when it breaks support/resistance, it goes!

I'm realistic to know I was fortunate to catch such a good move, frankly I would be very happy with 3 x 5 pips a day.

However, a great big thank you for your attitude.  Having paid for coaching in the past and being quite cynical, I sometimes thought that "those who can't, coach" (and charge handsomely for the privilege).  Just by the way you freely offer advice makes it clear you have a different ethos and one I hope some day to be in a position to copy.

Whether this method will work full time for me it's too early to say but that won't stop me being very grateful for your approach.

Sorry if this message sounds like too much *ss kissing but it's honestly how I feel, there are so many people out there ripping off would-be traders.

I promise future posts will be a lot more practical!

Thanks.

Hi Digitalis,

just a suggest for you , Metatrader is a free platform , I think it's really good since you can try over there demo account SRDC method and most important there is possibility to use Expert Advisors (automatic trading program coded by users) so that you can also backtest automatically whatever method you want. I think it's worth a try

You can find latest version here : http://www.metaquotes.net/files/mt4setup.exe

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Thanks Skyline.

I've downloaded MetaTrader now, looks interesting.  I used TradeSation before, thought it was a great programme and wrote some very useful day-trading alerts in their EasyLanguage.

I like this board, I used to frequent Trade2Win (as Gadgetman) but there were so many cynics and flamers it just got depressing.  Nice to see so many positive (and helpful) people around.

Now a whole lot of new stuff to learn, guess I know what I'll be doing this weekend.  I don't see any manuals to download on their site, I guess it's all contained in the help files.

Cheers and have a good weekend, think I'll go exchange my 35 pip coupons for some beer vouchers

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Looks excellent for free software.

I notice there is an optimization facility - has anyone tried that against SDRC to establish what the best stop loss and target would be?  If not, I'll have a go in a week or two once I've got the hang of it

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Yes Digitalis it's really a good piece of software and you can trade with a lot of broker using metatrader platform.

Speaking about optimization facility I cannot answer you because I never used it and I don't know how and if it could be helpful. Anyway all the Strategy Tester tools is really a good package to have an idea about how much good a system performed in old days

--- 帖子 #977 ---
No SL ( or 50 for gbp or so )...

TP is 5 pips...but can go up if you are good at it ...also helps to read SRDC 2.

I mean you will get 5 pips ( not bad)...but can get more if you use other ability like in SRDC 2 and few fundumental  and TA etc etc..

No SL per author of this thread Orange Juice - but thats because he can get out of the trade if he feels ( per his experience)  that it is going against him.

personaly , i like no stop loss USING MINI, and monitor the trade and fundumental and other tech analysys to determine exit.

Why have fixed SL...I can stop it my self ...of course stay out of potential spikes..

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I think it will be useful - if it's anything like other optimizers, you give it a range and it runs through all the combinations for a given period to tell you the most profitable number.

So for example, you could ask it to look at targets from 5 to 30 pips and stop losses from 10-50 pips and it would give you the best numbers to make most profit.

I'll get into it next week!

--- 帖子 #979 ---
I like the optimization idea and will look forward to the outcome of that.  That could help the process and results tremendously.

This is just an update on my issues I had with Xpresstrade yesterday during the GPB/USD news.  I could not get them to adjust my trade in any way, however, they must have had a million complaints, because today, an e-mail came out and stated that they were moving everyone back to their dealing desk, and re-instating their no slippage policy, with guaranteed spreads.  My guess is that they lost a lot of traders after the slippage issues on Thursday.  I know that I opened a new account elsewhere, but I haven't funded it yet.  I may give xpresstrade a second chance now that I get guaranteed spreads and no slippage again.

Just in case anyone is interested, I demo traded their platform for a couple of months and not once did I have even one pip of slippage.  Once I went live, I got anywere from 1 to 50 pips slippage on every single trade.  SRDC I was 100% profitable in demo.  While I only had one losing trade using SRDC I live (the GPB/USD News on Thursday), not one of my trades netted me my expected resluts due to all of the slippage.  In fact, my account has a negative drawdown simply because of the one loss on Thursday.  So, based on these results, I would be hesitant to believe that the demo systems work exactly the same as live trading, so be careful and do not expect your results to be the same until you have had a few weeks of consistent trading while going live.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Thank you.

May the Force also be with you too.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
No, demo does not work the same way as real.

By slippage it means that you were not the first to click the mouse to buy or sell and therefore your turn to buy was at a higher price ( others clicked the mouse before you did) - or sell at lower price...OR it means there was no matching order to lift your order at that price..if it was spiking etc

Just use mini real account to try and test your strategy.

actualy when you put  real money , even though it is small amount ( mini), you will pay attention to your account and test your strategy effectivly, and plust test real account senarios

hope this helps

After reading the first 35 pages of this thread, and taking notes on everything I learned, I decided to backtest this for a month on the EUR/USD. The month I used was Oktober 2006.

I used the really basic method of SRDC.

I used an indicator to automaticly set the H/L, then opened 3 positions if price hit High+3 or Low-3. Stop-Loss is fixed at High-27, Low+27.

PriceTarget1 = +5pips (High+8 or Low-8)

PriceTarget2 = +10pips (High+13 or Low-13)

PriceTarget3 = Discretionary, depending on trend lines/channels/week HL

PriceTarget1     PriceTarget2       PriceTarget3 Net Profit    25    -50    -24

# winners    17     13    11

#losers        2      6      8

Profit Factor 1.4     0.7      0.9

% time in dd  0.7    1.0      1.0

Of total amount invested, PT1 = 70% PT2 = 20% PT3 = 10%

Weighted profit: PT1=17.5 PT2=-10 PT3=-2.4

Netto: 5.1pips

Total Trades: 19

5 pips for a month of trading isnt that much. But remember, this is a very basic&easy strategy to use. In the next post I will comment on why it made losing trades, and what the results would be after a bit of tweaking.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
PT1 trades:

trade one was lost because it opened near the high of the last days 100pip Range (22pips from high) It touched a trendline, then fell back down in a hurry.

Second trade the last days range was 27pips. Price moved through low, moved up & touched the high, then fell back down in a hurry. the 30 pips stop-loss I used was right on the High.

PT2 trades (+PT1 trades):

trade one: 55pips day range, spike up against trendline then fell back. closeto last weeks high

trade two: Entry was based on a small weekend candle. , 20 pips away from last weeks low.

trade three: opened near last days low

trade four: no apparent reason.

PT3 trades I wont comment on because they are discretionary and have a small influence on the results.

New Rules

- Dont enter trades if new day opens at 80%+ or 20%- of last days high/low.

- Dont enter trades if you are close to last week high/low.

- Dont enter trades if you are close to an obvious trendline.

- Dont enter trades if yesterdays range is <50 pips.

Adjustments:

- leave out the PT3 trades, making you close 80% @ PT1 & 20% @ PT2

Number of trades has been reduced to 11, from 19.

Conclusion:

I guess its wise to use good filters, so you can reduce the number of losses. Or reduce the amount of these losses by using a tighter stop-loss. Or both lol . But I guess that's where SRDC-2 will kick in?

I'm going to read the rest of the topic now, and make another backtest after I'm finished. This time using a different currency, but the same month.

Take 4 different pairs, average 50pips/month on each pair (with loww risk) and yer prospects indeed look pipatastic!

Thanks OrangeRoshan for this system and your continued support of it. You got a new padawan joining your ranks.

Hi all, I'm new here and I'm looking forward to backtesting this method. It seems like a great method since I saw many people voted it in the "most profitable method" poll.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
I hope this system is profitable but so far I don't see those results most people are excited about. As far as your tweeking the system it seems like you are about to enter the "curve fit" road. Don't fall victim friend....

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Okay, here is the way you trade SRDC I. You must trade this method live. If you try to back test or set up limit orders you must set a scenario and limit yourself. For example, if you set the TP to 5 pips then you must set the SL to 30 to achieve 70 + percent win ratio. But then you say, wow that sounds good but each loss equals 6 wins so it makes it a loser in reality.

Now here is how SRDC I works in real life. You trade each and every SRDC I break and you will have above 80 percent win ratio. You target between 5 and 10 pips per trade but understand sometimes it will run for 20, 30, 40, even 50 pips. Then the 20 percent of the time you lose it will always be for the 30 pips. Now you have a winning method. I have been trading this in demo and live since the thread began and I can confirm what I am saying as fact. SRDC I may be the best way you will ever find to become a success in Forex. This simple but effect method by OrangeRoshan works and don't let anyone tell you different.

Traderbill,

If you don't mind to elaborate...why do we have to set SL 30 in order to achieve 70 + percent winning ratio. I'm quite understand the concept. Is it the risk and reward ratio?

I was using this example as to why it is better to trade SRDC I manually rather than set an order and go to bed.  When backtesting, to achieve a 70% + winning percentage you had to set a 30 pip SL.  You can see that if you lose 30% of the time but lose 6 times the amount of your wins, then the 70% becomes a loser.  Therefore when trading SRDC I it is important to get the maximum pips, sometimes this could be 5 and sometimes 50, but by doing this you can beat the testing and SRDC I becomes a major winning method.

Future,

From my experience, that is exactly what I am suggesting.  Perfect example is SRDC I on Friday where it ran on and on!  This allows you to offset the loss of 30 pips on the 20% of the time the trade goes the other way.  SRDC I is a big winner when traded properly.

Hi,

I using SRDC I. In the thread OR said you can babysit or leave it. From my experience (LIVE) my conclusion is, it will be wiser to babysit it (I tried both methods babysitting and leaving it...)

nonetheless i still believe its one of the easiest FX strategy ard. I only live for 3 weeks so tt only so much i can say.

just my 2pips worth of advise.

cheers

Ok Bill,

I got what you mean now. Thanks. I agree with you that its better to trade manually. That's the reason why, for the last couple post, I was looking for alert when the price close to break the daily high or low ( at least 10pips before).

I found the alert at accrete.com but  haven't tested it yet.

Happy Trading

Since you are not the world authority in Forex, your opinion is not important here. Nobody is a victim from learning my method. This world would be a much better place when people learn to stay more positive and associate with successful people.

Your post is negative and not constructive at all. Since you don't believe in this method, please don't use it ever but let others learn.

Hi Team,

It was another Pipastic SRDC I TradeS. There were 2 entries for SRDC I, the basic and the advance strategies.

The Thin Green line is the Basic entry, about 70pips, and

The Thick Green Line is the advanced entry, about 60pips.

The Red line is the high of yesterday (Friday 12th Jan).

Plus minus it would total around 100pips harvest.

Now based on this fact, even you have a losing trade on the early hour of the trade, SRDC I actually balances those loss. Ive said this before and I said it again, "CANDLE WILL PASS YESTERDAY'S LOW AND HIGH ALMOST 99% OF THE TIME". This is where we catch them. Sentiment can change, but it will never affect this strategy.

LISTEN TO THIS: THIS STRATEGY WILL ONLY STOP WORKING WHEN PRICES STOP MOVING!!! This method capitilise on the very LAW OF PRICE ACTION!!

I ain't gonna be here forever, spending my free time reading and writting posts after posts. When I was you, I'll learn and become a good student. Isnt success in forex what you are after? When anyone dispute this method, they are either dumbest or just destined to fail in Forex.

EGO has no place in Professional Trading.

OR

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Master OR, i thought that the basic entry must be above yesterday high?

yesterday high(resistance) + spread + 1 or 2 extra pips. So isnt the thin green line suppose to be above the red line? And thick green line have to be above thin green line?

--- 帖子 #999 ---
LOL.

When I said Yesterday's candle I mean Friday. Its the last trading day.

The Thin Green Line is where Thursday's High was. Thats the 1st entry. Of course you have to allow spread and margin, but thats only a few pips. Thats why I said plus minus pips.

The Thick Green line is the ADV strategy entry:

-Penetration

-Wait for full formation of candle outside the line

-Trade on the next open

The Red line is Friday's high.

Sorry for the confusion.

OR

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Ok thanks got it now.

Well since my timezone right now for yesterday is saturday(today is sunday), so i was like the redline cant be yesterday high coz yesterday was saturday . So my conclusion is the Thursday high.

But when you say it was on friday and i looked at the chart again, yup its friday high alright .

Thanks for bringing me back on the road

I LOVE the masterful teaching, here on the "creme de creme" of forex forums!...many thanks, ProfessOR !

Please help:

1) One of the SRDC1 basic rules is NOT to take trades when the price is near the weekly or monthly high or low. Unless I am mistaken, we are very nearly at both the monthly and weekly price high. If so, should we refrain from trading altogether until there is a definite downtrend? Or, should we take only Sell trades under these conditions? At what point would it be safe to resume Buy trades?

2) I downloaded the Teamspeak2 software, but I can't seem to make it work. Can anyone on this friendly forum help me, please?

Much appreciated,

Pipsqueak

Master Roshan,

SRDC 1 and the advanced method are my bread and butter( add jam and hot chocolate). Last Thursday, I encountered my first loss and it was a long battle that extended itself into the early morning hours of Friday when I finally surrender to the inevitable.... cut my losses and move on. The pair was the european monkey and looking in retrospective (monday quaterback in american football) and with the help of other more experienced trader, I felt that the timing was wrong. First, the euro had just experienced a large spike to the downside (110+ pips) followed by a ranging condition right before it triggered my SRDC 1. In addition to this the SRDC play took place during the slower Asian Session. Master OR, under these circumstances, was it incorrect for me to play the SRDC 1 method?

1) We are still 300pips away from the high of the year, so I suppose it ok to take a long trade when it happens. But, should it come to that situation, yes; we take only the other direction. Since USA is in a holiday mood, the market will be dominated by the British, which means....

2) PM Mellisa, Bill or Glen.

Hi 4rex,

I looked at the Euro, theres a good 10pips on SRDC I basic trade and SRDC I adv setup was not tirggered. I don't know how you lost that trade.

Bearing in mind EUR and GBP have a very close correlation, and during BOE announcement, GBP goes the other way. Euro didnt follow the Cable as the sentiment was lagging. But, when you look at the history, the sentiment will follow suit after 1-2 days. Thats what happen last Friday.

Another thing also, zoom out your daily chart, you will see for the whole week EURUSD was at a retracement area (MAY-OCT). So, what happen was predictable.

Losing trade is part of FX Trading. Its only natural. What is important how your supercomputer between your ears handle this situation.

Move on and continue, like nothing happen. More winning pips ahead!

Master OR,

I have been following this thread for a while and i really love the way u preached,but i have a silly question(if u allow me to ask?),which method do u use most of the time to trade? and why? thanks!

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Hey guys, just curious..how do we feel about the 'hunni i bought a 600SL' candle today-tomorrow...considering tomorrow is a holiday in the US?

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
If you look at the Euro SRDC1 trade from Friday morning 1:00 GMT time. The trade was only good for 2-3 pips for the first hour of trading after the new day started. If you drop down to the 15 min chart using SRDC1 + Advance that would have told us that the trade was bad to go for pips 5 pips. I myself got caught with that and did not use the advance to confirm that it was a losing trade.

Now if we would have used a higher s/l then you would have made the 5 - 17 pips including the spread around 13:00 GMT time. The question remains on are you willing to have a higher s/l. Master OR said that you should use 25 - 30 pip s/l or even 50 depending on the pair. I for one have done that and had a losing trade turn into profits. As you can see if we would have used a 40 or 50 s/l that trade would have turned out good in the long run.

Its all base on your MM if your willing to use a high s/l. Some people do not like using a high s/l just to get small pips and that is fine. You have to trade base on what you are willing to gain or lose.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Ziggy,

Very good point and one that should be seriously taken into account. If your risk management makes you play scared thus putting in tigher stop losses then you are not going to be succesful in the long run. I know, because I have done it at times and it makes one a bad trader. Another point and OR confirmed it in his reply to my post is that SRDC 1 and the advanced Part 1 may be easy to follow but there are other factors that should be taken into account. It is not automatic and even grandma needs to look in the rear view mirror(historical data) while driving the Pip Machine!

Thanks 4rex,

Any help much appreciated.....

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
A lot of brokers are using MetaTrader as their trading platform.

IBFX will show you the sunday candle, that's why most of us are using it.

If you want to only have one Metatrader application installed, you can copy the files you find under "Interbank FX Trader 4\config" folder with an .srv extension, copy it to your original installation, and open an account.

Good luck

I was wondering if anyone here can confirm on whether or not CABLE was the best pair to implement SRDC I, and on average how many PIPS can one expect from such pair. In other words, is a 5 TP too low and conservative or is it just fine ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
5 pips is 5 pips right?

this strategy will work on any pair. but as stated this isnt a just run your EA and go to bed. Look to the 15m timeframe and with good momentum, its in the bag. I say once over 5 pips, get out at any sign of reversal.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Hello,

I've read about 30+ pages of this method and it seems good.l I'm only a beginner too and so this type of method does sound good. However I was wondering if someone or orange could answer this question.

which indicator should i use in conjunction with this method to determine the strength of the move through the previous low or previous high ? because there will be some cases when it might just move 1 or 2 pips and then reverse, but if we could work out the strength of the move  or momentum then it could give a better confirmation of the signal.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
hi,

i have another question.

what happens if for example you make a trade using this method, going short as it has breached the previous low and you take your 5 pips, then the price reverses to above the previous low but then goes back down.

should you take this as another singal to go short again ?

-- i just found the answer to this question an it appears to be yes. --

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Thanks PipSteve and 4rex.  Followed both suggestions.

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Anthony,

When this occurs I usually wait for the price to significantly reverse above the previous low.  I don't count pips; rather, I break the previous day H/L into quadrants of 25/50/75 as OR does on SRDC2.  If the price reverses and touches the 25 line, I will allow another entry short over the 0.  By doing it in this manner you avoid alot of the chop.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
What I really like about this system is the fact that it does not try to predict where the price will go, like most systems.

Instead, it simply places strategic "traps" in order to catch pips wherever the price goes.

It is a very original and fresh idea. In the end all systems that try to predict the future by using thousands of indicators (all lagging) tend to turn into nightmares when the market stops trending.

Congratulations OR, really. I am still learning but I already like your system and I like the fresh approach.

Thanks

Hi guys and gals !

Unfortuneately I have a 8 to 5 daily job at the moment and can't

concentrate on Forex full time.

(Perhaps one day when my account allows it )

So I've decided to concentrate on SRDC I advanced.

I just draw a horizontal line at the high and low of the day

at midnight GMT and go long or short by a break of these lines

taking care of Orange's entry rules.

If I can grab 10 Pips per day by risting 2 lots that could be a nice

additional income

( 10 Pips/day => 50 Pips/week => 200 Pips/month => 4000 €/month )

Oh gosh this is my monthly income from my daily job....

At the moment I check it with my demo account on IBFX and

it looks nice

I hope to read soon your opinion about my decision.

Greetings and happy Pippin

Bernhard

Hi Orange !

With reference to my last post I have a general question regarding

switching from part time to full time trading.

I'm involved in Forex for about 4 years reading a lot of stuff and so on.

( You know the trial and error approach )

During this process the dust settled more and more and I could see

clearer whats going on

I've also read the books of Mark Douglas regarding trading psychology.

He mentioned that to be successful you have to bring together

the two forces everyone has inside.

1. The inner force => The wish to become successfull to reach a goal

2. The outer force => The daily work life which causes stress, demotivation

and so on.

So these two sides of the medal have to be managed and this is one of

the big causes why I am so cofused and disrupted.

I know you live your dream as a jedi master and family man.

You said that you had a kind of mentor and also the contacts

to the big boys .....

I didn't have them and have to rely on my own experience

may it be bad or good.

So it's a very hard way to find out the truth (like learning martial arts)

So as always in life one comes to a point when he has to make

a decision where to go in life.

It doesn't last long when I come to this point....

I know that my post does not belong to this thread but I only

want to mention it to read your opinion on my 2 cents.

Perhaps other guys and gals are in a similar situation and could comment

their situation.

Nethertheless may the force be with you.

Bernhard

Hi Behof ,

I'm in the very same situation , actually i cannot trade full time due to my work  And the bad thing is that at work I think everytime to trading so I don't work as I have to do and this is not honest so I'm trying really hard to find some alternative way with trading to have a fixed montly income that let me retire from my job.

Imho the only problem with calculations (that I did exactly as you a lot of time in my mind ehehe) is that you have to start with a big amount and trade with 1-2 full lot (i guess there need at least 20k to handle that lot volume), infact it could be easy to at first look to achieve a 200 pips a month but the real challenge is to do this every month.

On other hand in calculation you have also to take care about your R:R infact for only 10 pips gain how much do you place your sl ? 10,20,50 pips ? Even if SRDC method is really fantastic this could affect enormously your final balance. Anyway if you find some way to achieve that goal let me know

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Hi OrangeRoshan,

We have learnt quite a fair bit of yr methods, SRDC. We have yet to see the Money Mgt you deployed for this method. I know MM would be different between people and hope you guide us on this issue till we see light in the tunnel.

Thanks alot.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Mr. Future,

OR suggested that with the SRDC 1 method and the SRDC 1 advanced that we use what he calls the "three monkeys" gpb/usd, eur/usd, aud/usd. Lower spread which helps you gain those 5 pips. Most of us concentrate on the gpb/usd due to its volatility. Also because if you are a beginner in FX it is best to focus on one pair and learn it thoroughly. As you get more familiar with the method you can go beyond the 5 pips. The SRDC 1 advanced will help you with further confirmation of the direction of price thus harvesting more pips.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Anthony,

OR has taken care of your question by introducing the SRDC 1 advanced. Read about it in this thread and you will find what you want. Follow the rules and do not add anyother indicator.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Anthony,

The answer depends on many factors like what was the momentum of price when it broke through the support again. Also, was it after a strong reversal? How many pips has it moved in its daily range?  What trading session are you on when this happens?  So you can see that discretion comes into play and that is something that comes with experience. So generally speaking I would lean towards NO especially if you are a beginner.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
I agree on you about MM.

Master OR,

Im a newbie in forex and also you targeted SRDC 1 for newbies. So MM on this SRDC 1 would be great knowledge for newbies to maximise the profit of SRDC 1.

Ive read Master OR post somewhere in ForexFactory about MM but im still confused about it especially PAMM. And I know you don't encourage newbies to follow it because it is very dangerousss.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Can anyone advise me why the post I put on earlier today, about MT4 optimization, has disappeared?

If it's because I contravened a forum or thread rule, I would like to know so I don't repeat the mistake.

Thanks!

I learned it has been moved to the thread specific to EA in relation to SRDC.  Makes sense!

Is SHI_channel_true same as LRC?

I am unable to figure out how to use LRC and where the to drag it from. A month border of current month to the last candle? if so , which line, the median ?

Also

Is it the SR of the last single candle that I need to pay attention to or the over all High and Low of Yesterday SR?

I have had success with all.

-breakout from SR of the single last candle ( yesterdays) and wait for break.

Draw SR of yesterday all day hig and low break out.

Even break out of SR of few candles ( few minuts ago in the middle of the day)...

to get few pips on 1HR and 30 MIN

Is it luck or SRDC rule per Orange Juice is the same as i described?

Listening to Orange while I wait for answers.

I went to the proerties of LRC and added from 1-1-07  0000gmt till today.

Am i correct by plotting LRC that way..

I think the force is with me

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
SHI is not what we are using at this time.  It will adjust too quickly to any movement and will not pick up trend change easily.  You need to use the LRC and draw it manually.  Usually there is a channel of the day posted in that area of SRDC threads which can help you get an idea of where you may start.  You are welcome to come into Teamspeak room around 7 pm EDT US and we are discussing proper channel then.

If you used SRDC I to trade today (after 00:00GMT) then you probably had a good day.  It would depend on whether you used the Friday candle as the high and low to break or the Sunday candle.  I prefer to use the Friday candle because with IBFX the Sunday candle is only 1 hour.  If you used Friday you had a SRDC I long trade that could have harvested you between 20 and 50 pips.  Please pay special attention to recent highs and lows with all trades and adjust TP and SL accordingly.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Hi Bill, i announced my SRDC I entry at 1.9620 after the Sunday High break in the TS room and did glean 27 pips out of the trade but it took a while of rollercoastering : )

I do have a Q though. In your quote you state you prefer Friday's candle, yet as i understand the Sunday Rule vs the Friday candle if we had gone say short in this instance one would wait all the way for Friday's low instead of Sunday's low...that could/would make quite a difference. Although in hindsight (and i did not take any short trades off Sunday's candle this week), the Sunday/Monday reversal did not work out this time around. I just traded the break of Sunday's High after close of a 15m candle.

Just looking for clarification on your thoughts on this. Not looking for a right or wrong kinda thing, i'm just curious. The Friday candle H/L makes sense as Sunday is an anomoly : )

Thom

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Hi Accrete,

You mention here that the Sunday/Monday reversal did not work this time around....is that because it decided to go north in the long run?

The reason I'm asking is because when I look back at OR's post in SRDC II, post #53, he says that when the Monday candle opens, "immediately" place the trade in the opposite direction.  I've copied his statements below:

====================================================
Ebony and Ivory... live together in perfect Harmony.....

Side by side AT THE WEEKEND CANDLES, O TRADER CANT U SEE!!

Remember it? Thats exactly how the Weekend and Monday candles are. Upon the opening of the Monday candles, Immediatelly PLACE TRADE OPPOSITE TREND TO THE SUNDAY CANDLE.

SIMPPLY PIPASTIC!!

9/10 you will get it correct. Dont believe me, Go check your charts now!!

I sense more Jedi and Padawan will love Mondays...                                                                          _http://forexfactory.com/images/buttons/quote.gif================================================

I did not do this, but if I had, I would have made approx 30 pips before it turned around and went up again.  Instead, I waited for the Sunday low to break, and ended up losing approx 40 pips instead - ha ha - gotta luv it!  Then I messed up on getting in the long position too, so better luck next time.

Am I misinterpreting something somewhere?  I've digested so much lately, I'm beginning to doubt myself here.

No rush in answering, just when you have time if that's OK.

Thanks!

Lyn

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Hi Lyn, your interpretation is spot on. What i've found is that for me i miss the Sunday/Monday event as i'm at work so i will often wait until 00:00 GMT as i did last nite (i usually wait until 08:00 !) and see if there is an SRDC Iadv setup which is how i entered. What i've found in my studies on the Sunday/Monday trade is you've got to be quick on the trigger and just have faith and not be greedy, as often at the end of the day there was that nice opportunity in the first few moments of the Monday open where it will in fact comply in the opposite direction as it did this weekend.

4 more pips eurusd short @ 2932 harvest @ 2928 = 100$ a pip =  2 lots $800.

SRDC probability works.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Accrete,

I believe that Grandma would say that SRDC 1 did work for the Sunday Candle. The low was 1.9583. That would put the entry @ 1.9578 and the candle went as low as 1.9571. 5 Pips with room to spare.. but NO! you young whipper snapper wanted more!  Grandma was right!    By the way I did not listen to Grandma either but I played the reversal.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
I only trade that reversal if it goes with the SRDC I movement.  I just don't trade a SRDC I trade off the high or low of the Sunday candle because it is only one hour.  I hope that clears it up.  I think OR wants us all to be free thinkers within the system.

Traderbill

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
AHH , got it. It is SR of the last candle (1.9583), not last days high (1.9665)..

also, I got a password error when attempting to get to the TeamSpeak.

I used amanuel / ip per your link / and pipastic as passerd - still no luck

ALso can I configure LRC channel by going to the property and selecting the parameters to be ( 2007.01.01 01:00, in my case alpari +1gmt) up 'till to current time's candle correct???

This is pipastic got my 11 pips today from aud and eur / usd.

Also as an my 2 pips for n00bs: low spread broker is the way to go on this. I'd rather get lower leverage with less spread than high leverage and wide spread for SRDC. because thats xtra pip or 2 x 5= 10 pips a week = 40 xtra pips a month I will have, rather than paying brokers - not to mention  they may slip my order now that i am profitable ( well thy should not if thay are smart since i am making them pips too from the spread ).

Any way

interesting.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Hi 4rex, im confused here, hope you can clear it up for me,

if I go on my chart ibfx, my price on the chart is the bid btw, im sure yours is to, any way so i enter at 1.9578 bid and close at 1.9571 bid, price didnt' go any lower that day, so that's all one could have gotten, now with a 4 pip spread, that only gives 3 pips profit, not 5 with room, I'm just trying to understand SRDC 1 properly and this doesnt add up, am I missing something? I dont' wanna leave extra pips on the table. Please let me know, if I got it right, or I am missing something.

I believe that Grandma would say that SRDC 1 did work for the Sunday Candle. The low was 1.9583. That would put the entry @ 1.9578 and the candle went as low as 1.9571. 5 Pips with room to spare..

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Yes, @ 4 pips spread, to get 5 pips, you need to get out at 1.9573 ask 1.9569 bid

But once you advance ...srdc2, you may harvest more pips...so that wont matter.

But thats why it is important to get a broker with 1 or 2 pip spread.

And I think these brokers have low margin which is also good to be safe.

May need 4 times the fund if used 1:100 as oppose to 1:400- but still get a smaller spread ( outside news )

- so for eurusd for eg @ the current price,instead of $660 ( for 1 lot , 100k) (i.e $330 for used margin, $330 for available margin (30 pip loss max ) ,you now need four times that $1760- but pips wise, you get 40 extra pips a month  ...approx -

Thats 400$ a month for 10$ per pip or $4000 @ 100$ per pip

(if one saves 1 or 2 pip per srdc trade, thats 2 a day, 10 a week, 40 a month xtra pips saved....but you just put 4 times the fund to get low margin 1:100

Well- still high, but for serious gamblers with most probable edge, its ok.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
as of now , 12:45 est am, it seems to reverse, and about to brk previous high - eur and gbd

as it is going up- it shall come down - if it does not break the second channel border

srdc2 in action. If you draw SHI_channel, yould just open your mouse and say wow.

took srdc profit, then shi 15 min chart did show that eurusd must go up to 1.2950 and then come down to about 1.2925 or half way 1.2935- ( this may change as shi shifts according to current trend

if shi shows trend change on 15 min chart, then will adjust accordingly.

Orange, thank you master.

Listening to your recording as we speak.

I did not sleep for almost 20 hrs now...waiting for gbp open.

also before going to bed i will

straddle at both sund and mond SR

R 1.2957 for long gbd

S 1.2920 ( average S )

TP 10 pips or 20 max

if buy stop not met, then will look for other opportunity

here is the graph of 15 min with shi...took profit on the way down.

the sell trade for audusd is not going well.

I didn't take the GBPUSD trade today, because I knew there was high impact news on the CPI (thank you Forex Factory).

What is the opinion about using SRDC on big news days?

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
4rex- thanks for your replies, i have found the post where it describes how to check the 15min charts before placing a trade !

Mr Smith,

I forgot that I use a nondealing desk broker with better spreads. In my case it did work.

Sorry for the confusion.   In my case it is usually 1+ 2 for spread

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Can I ask what other users of SRDC I Advanced are using as an exit trigger?

I feel comfortable enough now that I don't want to hold out just for 5 pips anymore (and haven't been, thank you OR!) but cannot yet find a method I'm comfortable with.

Maybe this is covered in SRDC2 but I don't even want to look at that yet, I want to carry on with SRDC I for another couple of weeks and make sure I get good experience before trying to move onwards and upwards!

So, do you set a profit target, do you use an indicator, do you use a candle pattern or maybe the phase of the moon or a Deathstar approaching?

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
...patience

either you should have gotten your 5 quick as soon as it penetrated last candle SR - or SL should be wide to wait for the bounce that may never happen - ( though the latter one is scary )

For eg, eurusd went 90 pips up before coming down again but that was after it gave its few 5 pips- so if you did not take your 5 pips, you will loose if you had 90 PIP SL.

Now that is scary.

Per Orange, he suggested no SL- and he is right - but will we do that ??

I am working on SL - but then again, that is the BIG Q of all traders.

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
there is no news @ 00 gmt....well there is AUD news ...I stay out of news or place a reasonable SL.

SL is the key to most success or failures..i think

srdc1 = 5 pips -  but the issue here is SL ..

thats it my friend.

for more pip harvesting, you need to add other abilities - and /or srdc 2..

makes the game a bit interesting ( may even loose your precious 5 pearls trying so ..

If news does not mess things up- eur gbp and aud are all going down-

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
I've read the thread lots of times and discovered I was entering at the

exact SR of the previous candle....not as instructed.   Now, add 1-2 pips

plus spread for entry.   Right???   Then, add 5 pips for TP, Right???

Guess I too am nervous about placing a SL or using no SL.   I've  had

trades (in general) which were right on..eventually... but got stopped out

before reaching target.  Losses on only a few trades were bigger than gains,

not cool.   So, I'm practicing SRDC I carefully.  Im on EST and place trades

around 7:00 pm  (00 GMT).  I must have faith overnight and look for my

surprises in the am.    Thanks for this method and all the Q and A's which

enlighten us newbies a lot.

On IBfx, we must enter 2 separate trades to straddle each daily candle.

Should I trade with no SL on both?  I'm tired of getting stopped out of

otherwise good trades.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
THANKS FOR THIS trading method.   As a newbie, I am committed to

getting the hang of trading successfully.

Have had costly experiences with getting stopped out of otherwise

good trades, even at 50 pips.    I get discouraged by this.   On IBfx, we

must place 2 separate trades to straddle each daily candle.   No SL on

both??   Oh......it's scary.

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
Elo^^ would anyone out there mind to explain more precisely to me about the Sunday/Monday candle. I do understand about the size of the candle, as it could be very very small in size ...therefore, its simply easy for the next candle to panetrate it highest high or lowest low. However, i dont really understand when it comes to ......like open a trade oposite to the Monday cadle....bla bla bla...lolz..^^ Any jedi or Jedi Masters mind to explain it to me ? Thx Alot In Advance ^^

+4 pips on eur usd - short at 2916 - harvest @ 2908

srdc 2

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
I suggest you read the introduction 10 times till you understand this simple method- It is soo simple, people overlook it since they think every thing should be complex.

If the last single candle on sund SR has been breached, you will harvest min of 5 pips...after that you advance to srdc 2

God bless

give and ye shall receive

hope that helps

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
if there is no news affecting- eur usd will retract.

I 'd straddle 2904 for short and 2935 for long

tp for each 10 pips, but sl hmmmm- thats the Q..

SL is the key

i am scared on this one- but we will see

I also think the key is to stare at the screen 10 hrs a day- to see the behaviour of your pair.

You need to know your pair most likly behavious- its like going on the same road again and again and again, and you will get used to the street, and predicting traffic light, road turns, and other things will be predictable with high probability.

Coupled with srdc, MA, rsi, srdc 2, fundumentals , one can predict ( with few failures).

then comes momey mgmnt- reduce loss and run profit ( i will work on improving the latter)

Blessed are thirsty in knowledge for they shall receive it

read read read read read read stare stare stare stare at the screen.

Know your pairs

Happy piping-

I personally feel that GBP/USD is the safest, followed by EUR/USD. I am disapponted by AUD/USD for now....

With GBP/USD I place 10 pip TP and so far so good, it did well three days in a row with no problems. EUR/USD I use 5 pips TP and in the two days I've used it it did well also.

I used 30 pip SL btw on both....

I will use it everyday the same way to see for how long they will do good.....

Once I have a good number of days to compare I will draw my conclusions.....

Future

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Yeap, even orange says gbd and also eur usd...

it gives few pips after the breaching of sr, and srdc 2 will come to play also after that...

SL, man thats the million pips question...

AUD is safe as far as going opposite to your trade ( in my opinion)

but yes initialy gbd and eur may give out few more than 5 ...but then when to tp will be the dilema and before you know it it will reverse trying to get more than 5 pips dossage subscribed by orange- lol

why were you dissapointed by aud, it gave me few pips @ open

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Well could u pls tell me which intro ? SRDC 1 or 2 ? Actually i just wanna understand more about the sunday/monday candle more. and as for the basic concept of SRDC1 I've understood them well. I just wanna know why is there a post on SRDC1 on the previous pages that I read, it said about putting the trade on the opposite direction of the monday/sunday candle......i am quite blur bout that ^^ hope u can explain that for me ? thx alot ^^

My fellow padawans, jedis and Master OR,

Yes, I have been a cowboy and I am telling the whole galaxy! Mind you not the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN type but a sucessful SRDC 1 and + trader(so far) that has chosen at times to throw away my profits by scalping and trading during news releases. Now I know that there are closet cowboys in our galaxy who live in the shadow of this double identity. This multiple persona is not limited to trading; it manifest itself in politics, religion, sports, personal relationships etc. So why am I sharing this embarrasing testimony? Because by coming out it forces me to be honest with myself and YOU will be my witnesses. Maybe this confession will help others as well.  I would also like to bow to our Master and mentor Orange Roshan and pledge my loyalty to his teaching and not waste this incredibly opportunity to help myself, my family and other sentient beings. All of you have my permission to ask me the following mantra: How is your discipline?

Like some of our jedis and OR has told us many times ....The SRDC method can change your life and you in turn can change the lives of other too.

May the force be with you.

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
Glitz,

Go to the thread SRDC II and look at post #53.  I think this may be what you're looking for, or somewhere near there.  It talks about placing trade immediately in opposite direction as soon as little Sunday candle closes.

Hope this helps,

Lyn

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Digitalis,

Exit strategy is probably the most difficult part of a trade because unless you are a rock, your mind and emotions can play tricks on you. So what I would suggest is scaling out of your trade so that you can end up a winner or at worst breakeven. One of  OR recommendations is a 70%/20%/10% price target approach. You decide what your first take profit will be 10 pips? 20 pips? and then pick a take profit for the 20%. The last 10% can be a trail stop and just let it ride. Stop Losses can be adjusted after your 70% so that you can at least break even.  The more experienced traders might use indicators such as CCI, Fibo, trendlines etc. But for now you might be better of just making sure that you winning trade does not turn into a loosing one. Gain confidence and consistency. That should be your goal. By the way, OR will be adding a Money Management thread in the near future.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Amanuel,

I am not clear what you mean when you say that after harvesting min of 5 pips during the sunday candle strategy that you advance on to SRDC 2. Are you saying during the same span of time, a second trade after trading the sunday candle? the next day? This is confusing me. What if I am not ready to advanced to SRCD 2? I am not sure what you are recommending.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Amanuel,

I am confused to the strategy that you are recommending here....Ma's, RSI,10 hours of staring at your monitor? I have been trying to find these recommendations in Orange Roshan's post and I have yet to find them. Can you point me in the right direction?

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hi OrangeRoshan and other traders of SRDC,

I wanted to ask you what combination of tp and sl do you use? If you just aim for 5 pips with a stop loss of 40, then 1 losing trade wipes out 8 winning ones. So in real trading maybe that would not be profitable.

Some traders say they do not trade with stop loss. Thats not true because everyone does, each trader must have a level at which they are forced to close position because the loss is too great for them. I want to set that stop loss when I open the position so my trades are mechanical and emotion free.

Please give me some insight on how to trade the SRDC1 system. Thank you for your help.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Well, most people suggest 30 pips SL, which would still kill a good number of good trades (6). Now, here's the problem; if you are going to place a bigger SL, you may get stopped less times, but when you do get stopped, it will be huge. Placing a smaller SL instead will stop you more times and you will risk getting stopped even during good trades.

What to do ? Well, what I am doing is demoing this baby like crazy in order to come to the conclusion on whether or not the winning trades will always be more than the losing ones with a 30 pips SL. If it works out, then great, if it doesn't, then it will be just like any other system where it has the potential to do good but each individual's fears and guts will determine how profitable it is.

Like some suggested don't only think at 5 pips TP, 'cause most of the times it is more than that, therefore it has the potential to kill the losses. But, do you have the time to baby sit the trade for one entire day and don't sleep ?

I guess that only by continuing demoing it we will be able to draw some statistics on this system and make adjustments.

Peace

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Good Thinking.....

What do you think the best solution for this situation....May be an intellegent EA? I'll love to hear you opinion on this.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Sorry for the consusion:

After the first candle trade, I then switched to what i thought was srdc2 by switching to 15, 30 min chart with shr and found out that momentarily ( same day , few minutes after daily open ) it was going to bounce back from the upper border (top) towards bottom ( i think this is the same candle that is opened on 1 hr chart or may have been the 2nd or 3rd candle on the hr chart). Though OR said top-mid-bottom off of LRC for the over all daily price, I did it via shr and the price within the next 15-20 minutes was moving about shr top-mid-bottom and caught it on the way down... and got few pip from the bounce that happened from top towards the mid via short. ( i did not care what the long term trend (lrc) is at this point since it is a quicker time frame.

In otherwords I never traded lrc top-mid-bottom method, but mistakenly, though it gave me pips, i did it via shi within the same day but lower time frame.

It is an interesting finding, but i need to do this consistantly to say it works most of the time ( just like anything else).

As far as shi moving arround, i draw a permanent line every now and then to see if it has shifted- and if it stays steady but price is moving up and down, then i will try to follow the trail and nail it as i did yesterday.

will continue testing.

Sorry for the confusion- was just adding the fact that I was also considering fundumentals and MA's etc..

but that does not belong to this forum.

There is really no need to add confusion.

srdc1 is a good method for 5 pips minimum. We will concentrate on that.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Guys, those of U who doubt this method looks like you never read this thread from the beginning, page per page, from page 1 till end.

The big question to everyone of U who ask like this : "This 5 pips target will be wiped out if we get one stop loss on 30 pips or 50 pips" is :

HAVE YOU EVER TRIED THIS METHOD, LIVE OR DEMO ?

HAVE YOU EVER REALLY, I MEAN, REALLY, REALLY CALCULATE AND ANALYZE?

I have did demo trade this method start on Mid of November 2006 till end of November 2006, then start it on Live since 4 December 2006 on GBP/USD only. First, I use 5 pips target and 55 pips stop loss. Now I start using 7 pips, or even 10 pips, depend on market sentiment. From December till now, I have never ever being stopped loss. I don't know what broker you are using, but in my two brokers, I've never being stopped out !!! Even just once!!!

May be you ask, why 5 pips target? why 55 pips stop loss? Because, the aim of this strategy is, how to trade Forex with 99% possibilities profit, or even 100%? NOT TO GET TONS OF PIPS !!! Please, understand this philosophy !!!! This is Forex, 0 is better than -1, and 1 is better than 0, and so on.

Do your math, do a simple calculation. Do a compunding trading. You will get surprised that even 5 pips could make your $5 become $18,474 in 260 days (work days in 1 year) if each your trade using 64% of your margin and 5 pips target!!!! Confuse with this one? Use microsoft excel to do the math, do compounding trading. If you earn profit, you will increase your equity and use 64% margin from the new equity to trade on the next day !!!!

So why 64% margin?

In my broker, if my available margin or free margin fall below 0 (zero), then they will liquidate my open position automatically. I have done a simple calculation, that on leverage 1:100, if I use my 64% margin to trade, then they will auto-liquidate my position if the market againts my position by 56 pips or more.

What if you want to use this method as set and forget method? You have 100% margin. Use 40%-40% of your margin to trade, put buy stop and sell stop, trust me, if the market price againts your position by 50 pips, with this 40%-40% margin your free margin will fall below 0 and that is your stop loss. Then you will not sit on your computer the whole day.

Why are you afraid to get your stop loss? In my experience, the GBP/USD price usually could give more than 5 pips, it could even give you 7 pips, 9 pips, 10 pips, 20 pips or even more than 50 pips. You don't believe me? Check your interbankfx chart using 1H from December till now.

C'mon guys.....this is Forex, if you don't want to get stopped then BE A GOD ON THIS FOREX TRADING!!! NOT A HUMAN !!! We can manage our trade so the stop loss will not be a nightmare to us !!! Use our skill to analyze, Forex is not just a technique to trade, but you must combine it with MONEY MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE !!!

Why we should be afraid of one day being hit a 50 pips stop loss but we still can recover it on the next days!!!!! Personally, OrangeRoshan has opened my eyes, that even with a very, very, very simple method like this, Forex seems so profitable !!! THANKS TO HIM !!!!

Regards.

PS : Ah...almost forget, I did my trade not with the advanced one, I am still using the first method as you guys see in the first page. Trust Master Roshan, even 5 pips DOES MATTER !!! Do your math, make your own calculation as I can not expose my excel file here. Why? As I am afraid, if the brokers look at the calculation inside, then they will make a new restriction : "TRADING WITH SRDC1 METHOD IS NOT ALLOWED HERE, WE WILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT IF YOU USE THAT METHOD IN OUR FIRM!!!!"......LOL. As master Roshan said : KEEP IT SIMPLE !!!!

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Excellent point.

And the only obstacle of this method is SL.

OR is so confident that he will let it run with enough margin ( heh, not sure if there is enough margin for a 'NO SL' event) to cover it and will wait for it to come back...hmmm ( come back? what if it never does?).

The odds , per OR, and me backtesting it ..it  is approx  80% and above- ( somthing like that ).

Demo it and see for yourself.

As far as staring at the screen all day to get 5 pips, well, thats where EA comes in.

but it is interesting to find 5 pips every day with simple methos like this.

Beats any damn strategy out there.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Bom-Bom right on th emoney..

I am wondering why do we even have to beg them to do it.

Let them try it and get it if they are interested.

If not, find other method- there is tons out there.

Seek and ye shall receive.

Blessed are the thirsty, for they will .....

if you want it bad, you would read every post under srdc and FF for that matter...FF rocks, and you will find knowledge here.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
Hmm...yes Amanuel, I did not beg them to do it. I just want them to think outside the box and think more and more. If they read this thread since page 1 there are some people ever posted that doubt and OrangeRoshan himself has answered them, then there will be no similar posts like those again, as Master Roshan has answered it. Hope they understand that even my post is not trying to make an offense to them.

Let's  keep this thread ROCKS and full of constructive ideas, as DOUBT HAS NO PLACE IN FOREX  !!!!!

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Hi^^ ! 1st of all i would like to thx u for replying my doubts ^^

Infact, i have followed wut u said, and have a look at the SRDC2 thread, i found the posts about the sunday/monday candle. I understand that the sunday/monday tiny little candle will most probably follow by a big candle after it and the big candle's direction will most pobably be at the different direction from the sunday/monday candle, Am i right ?

But i have 1 more problem, which is I am currently using the MT4 platform as my chart provider, and I am living in Malaysia (GMT +8). I dont see any Sunday candle during my Sunday ?!!? Why isiit so ? Is there any ways that i can change the settings in MT4 so the sunday candle is visible during my Sunday ?

thx In Advance^^

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Use the interbankfx demo platform, you can download it here :

Inserted Code http://www.metaquotes.net/files/interbank/ibsetup4.exe

use that platform to analyze and trade using your broker, the time in that is already GMT.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
Hi Glitz,

I believe the understanding is that most of the time, the bar following that little Sunday bar will be a good trade in the opposite direction of the Sunday bar, so you have it right.

As Bom-Bom suggested, the interbankfx platform would be the one that has that little Sunday bar.  It's the one I use for this.

Lyn

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
I 've lread all these positive posts about this method and the users recommending GBP/USD which I agree with. So let's say you are using 50 pip stops and 5 pip targets. If you look at 1/05/07 that failed going long and 1/07/07 going short that is 100 pips lost in 4 days. That requires 20 winning days to break even.

Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Yes, you are missing something sir. It is called TRUST.

I just don't understand why you even bother to come to this thread, if you don't trust SRDC method.

Go Predict your Future with RSI before commenting on SRDC, specially when you don't even know if it is called SRDC or SDRC (look your post# 10 in (poll) Most Profitable thread).

Be constructive for a change and please don't bother to reply.

Hello All,

I must be missing something    - the SRDC I trades showed that the 5th worked (really well) and there was no trade on the 7th (weekend). Unless you are trying to trade the weekend candle on the weekend, not on the monday.

Take a look at this trade. Isn't this a loser too. On 1/04/07 the low was 1.9262 then on the following trading day the low went down to 1.9261 on 1/07/07. Any comments?

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
steinitz,

Is yr charting strictly based on GMT time ??

I saw GMT -8 on yr charting. You could have got the pricing wrong based on time. Pls confirm..

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
It is based in GMT time only. Please get interbankfx MT4 for GMT charting.

You got the timing all wrong.

Start day 0000hr GMT.

End day 2359hr GMT.

Then use the day High/Low as support/resistance.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Try not to be smart alec.... compare the data feed between InterbankFX and yr charting...and see the difference.

If u insist on using yr chart timing for SRDC 1 and make losses, don't come here to cry father mother...

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Steinitz, please understand the rule of this method, that is why in my previous post I said, READ THE THREAD SINCE ITS BEGINNING, FROM FIRST PAGE ONE BY ONE TILL END.

OrangeRoshan ever said, what ever broker you use to trade is up to you, but use Interbankfx chart to calculate the Buy Stop Price and Sell Stop Price. THAT IS THE RULE !!!! and interbankfx uses the GMT to calculate Buy Stop and Sell Stop.

And one more thing, you can not follow the system blindly. That's why read from the beginning until you get a full description of thet method. The price you were trying  trade on 3 January (from high of 3 January) formed a double top formation. On 25 December, the GBP/USD jump to 9740 and close at 9739 and the next day open at 9609. So I think this price level is a strange level and I don't want to take a trade on a level like this. If you read this thread completely, there are some restrictions apply for this method, like Weekly High/Low or Monthly High/Low, when the price come to that level, you may consider SRDC1 advanced strategy to trade. Me myself didn't put Buy Stop that day cos this thing!!!!

Once again, read the complete Thread, then make a Conclusion !!!!  You can not trade using a method that you learn in instant way !!! This is Trading method, not milk, if this is milk, you can get it Instantly, so it becomes INSTANT MILK !!!  Don't be angry my friend, I am trying to joke with you !!!    No Offense okay, we're just trying to be objective !!! Again, Please, do read the whole thread !!!

Thanks 4Rex - yes  a good solution.  I was about to work on that when I read Bom-Bom's post which I think sums it up perfectly.  I'm getting too impatient, or greedy, or both.

So I'm just going to go for the consistency, a regular 5 pips on GBP and EUR.  Because I spreadbet, I can always just increase the £/point once I'm consistent.

Thanks for you advice (and thanks Bom-Bom for putting things back into context!)

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Hehe,

No more quarells please. What works for others might now work for some...No system is a hundred percent system. To Steintz. Try looking at your daily candles first...all the way for 6mth to one year. Ok i wun be biased...use watever gmt u like not all are winners...but i can tell u 90% of those candles whip their HL no matter what timing u use. Just look at dailies. For me i just need 11 pips daily. oopps

anyone else using a trailing stop for SRDC1? It cuts some trades short at BE or less than 5 pips but it lets other run.

There was once a great Jedi who had thousands of disciples, and his mere presence at the courts of kings was regarded as conferring legitimacy upon their rule.

But he very seldom spoke. When he did, it was about matters which did not seem to be connected with the force. And yet many great Jedi masters attribute their attainments to having sat at his table, or from being in his guest house, or even from associating with the other disciples, or working in his house.

One day, this great Jedi was challenged by a famous preacher to dispute with him on the matters of trading SRDC. The preacher claimed that the Jedi knew nothing about the force, and spoke very little on weighty matters because he was ignorant of them.

The Jedi set out to meet the preacher. Each of the disputants was attended by hundreds of students, who had assembled, together with a multitude of townsfolk, to witness the duel of these giants.

The challenger began his tirade with a carefully thought out sentence, obviously preparing to launch a full-scale attack. Then, suddenly, after less than a minute, the Jedi stood up and pointed his finger at the preacher, who stood like stone, abruptly ceasing to speak before fleeing from the hall.

On the way home, one of the disciples said to his master, who had been cheered to the echo by the delighted audience: 'Why did you choose to throw paralysis upon that man, instead of refuting his arguments?'

The Jedi answered: 'If you have a sword in your hand, do you charge the opponent with mud bricks? Even a monkey would not chatter if it could do something more effective. That man wanted to defeat me, not to discover the truth.'

Goldsmith,

I use trailing stop once I have taken my second profit. 70%/20%/10%(with a trailstop)  I like to let it run since I would be in positive pips even if it is triggered.

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
If you go throught the SRDC1 thread from the beginning you will see that OR had us only aim for 5 pips for a reason.  It's true that we take many more than 5 pips, but in the beginning we only took 5.  Now see if you can discover why on your own by reading the thread.  And please keep it positive in here!  You see some of us have been here since the beginning and we are like family, and we know this system works.

Ouch ! Got in last night on EUR/USD at 1.2903 (prev day low 1.2908 + 5 pips spread) with a 5 pip TP and a SL of 30 pips. Well,  I got kicked out a few minutes ago....$300 demo money down the drain.....

My Fellow Padawans

When in doubt refer back to this two documents. Do not allow any substitutes. If you have questions or confused about the method it is safer to stick to the words of our master instructor. As you read these threads you will come to know the real jedis. DO NOT BE LED ASTRAY. STICK TO THE RULES AND YOU WILL SUCCEED.

The SRDC LEVEL II MANUAL WILL BE UPDATED SOON TO INCLUDES THE LASTEST TEACHING. BUT FOR NOW IT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT AND GENUINE GUIDE

Yes, see my post above as well, regarding being near the round number.  I think I will carry on using SRDC, then apply SRDC I advanced as a more cautious approach when near round number, say within 15-20 pips.

So it looks as if I'll be using SRDC I advanced on the GBP soon!

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Hi,

Today was not a good day, so far, for SRDC I due to several factors associated with news and the fact that we are up against major S/R, at least on GBPUSD and EURUSD. If you look at your weekly chart you will see that price has been oscillating around 1.2908 for some time. Please refer to link for further information on why this is so:

Click here

We must also consider Orange Roshan's trade rules as defined in:

OrangeRoshan SRDC method.doc (112.5 KB, 4313 views)
(SRDC1 pg.1/post#1)

1) Watch the monthly / weekly highs and lows. I would avoid a trade when it is near to the H&L. Price might reverse against your favour before it hits your takeprofit.

Regards,

Hi 4rex,

could you teach me how to do 3 TP on metatrader4?

Or is it that you open 3 position at a time?

I already know about the 3 TP points since it been discuss before in SRDC 1 thread, and SRDC 2 also i think(forgot). But i dont know how to do that unless we open 3 position for each buy/sell stop.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Usefu link thanks, clearly the 1.2908 was resistance and has now become support....

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Taken form the SRDC II thread from OR's rules:

I hope Dr Who counts.  Maybe I'll be accepted if I think up some quotes.

At any rate, I was wondering if I can verify some stuff from last night.

First my Cable trade didn't get activated. I closed it out before 11am New York session time, which it looks like it went perfectly up.  Maybe I should've waited.

Euro I didn't take, too close to resistances or trend.

And Yen broke through Before Tokyo opens by an hour I think, so I missed it.  Maybe it's because NZD had some releases last night before my daily candle closes.  Yen would've been a good trade probably, I just decided to wait until Tokyo opens to place the orders lately.

Anyone else have a similiar situation last night?

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Getting bored waiting for the GBP to break, I decided to count the number of times the Monday daily candle was a reversal of the Sunday candle.

Nothing clever, just was Monday the opposite colour to Sunday.

And the results?

From 1st January 2006 to today a total of 54 Mondays traded, less 3 holidays so 51.

Of the 51, 33 were reversals, 18 not.

So 64.7% yes, 35.3% no, or a ratio of 1.8:1 - nearly double.

Like I say, nothing clever and you'd have to go into a lot more detail to show you could make a profit trading this, but I believe the Tango Man!

Hi all, i have been testing the original SRDC Method Episode I this month

i am using a TP of 5 pips and a 25pip SL, only GBP/USD

Out of 12 days traded i got 13 trades (1 day price brokes both-ways.)

Out of that 13 trades, 12 winners and 1 losser.

So, 12 x 5 = 60 pips less 25 of the stop loss.

TOTAL = 35 pips.

I´m trying to figure out which is the best SL for this pair, any thoughts?

thanks,

Dan.-

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Sorry to hear that, but wow 5 pip spread on euro? I got in at 1.2906 (1.2908 - 2 pip spread) and made my 5 pips in about 20minutes time.

I know I didn't add the extra pip for safety on the entry price, but seems like it worked out for me.

Good luck to everyone.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
GBP didn't work for me today, because of the round number I got in long using advanced, after a clear candle, 19723.  Stopped out at 19693.  I see now why OR suggests a 50 pip stop on GBP, will have to watch and see where it goes.  Or maybe this is just one of the losing ones, we know it won't be 100% wins.

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
I don't know about you or anyone else, but I'm going to forward check/back check all my trades for now on and log all the retracements prior to it hitting 5pips Take Profit.

I want to see what the numbers are per pair, because if unnecessary, like your week, 30 pips wiped out half the profit.

Though profit is profit!

And of course, with SRDC II or monitoring the trade live, will create bigger gains making a 30 point stoploss not a big deal.

In other words, there are a lot of things that will change the outcome of your record and make your trades better or worse.  If I followed Yen for more than 5pips more often,being stopped out isn't as bad now.

Though I'm a "newbie", but I'm sure no one will disagree with this one.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Hi,

Thanks for your reply to my post.

Bom-Bom said from December 2006 to present he has never been stopped with a sl of 55 pips. That information is the most useful in his very long post.

A fellow trader asked for a simple expert, where we can change the tp and sl, and see which combination is most profitable. Im sure such an expert has already been created before in this thread. Can someone direct me, us, to the particular post? Maybe we can backtest it with say 80 tp and 35 stop loss, etc..

If someone has had a bad trade and tells us of it, then we should welcome that. Not reply to say only positive posts are welcomed. We should create realism in this thread and not be dreaming that this system is good because we have been unsuccessful in the past, although it may be.

OR has put alot of effort in this thread and forum. We thank him for that, but we will continue to constructively critisise the system if we want, which is healthy.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
December 2006 is only almost a month of testing.  Maybe if he said 2005 that would be impressive.  Though, in 3-4 weeks that's still really good.

Let's say, for pure fantasy and arguements sake, that you get stopped out with a 20s/l as you would with a 30s/l.  I would then use 20 instead of 30 and save 10 pips worth of losses.

I'll still get stopped out at times when I forget there's a resitance or trendline stopping me.  I'd just like to see all the frequencies of every pair.

But I post here and talk about all this, because this system is working amazingly and I like it a lot.  it's the best I've used so far, and with only 5pips a trade too!

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
I'm beginnign to tire of Interbank's 4 pip spread on cable. I know they say it's only 3 but this is rare for me. May move SRDC over to EURUSD where it seems they stick to 2 more often.

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
Balflear,

Sorry I can not help you since I use another broker. I use MT4 for my charts etc. Go to the MT4 thread there you might find your answer.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
As am I (I'm with ibfx too). I hardly ever see it lower than 4 pips. That's why I'm doing the Euro instead of Pound.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Well, in my case GBP did well, but barely !!!!

I got in at 1.9710 (prev day low 1.9705 + 5 safety/spread pips) with a SL at 1.9680 and a TP at 1.9720.

The day's high was 1.9721, barely giving me my 10 pips before going south....

Thank Jedi powers !

Future

PS: BTW, if it wans't for the SL that got me out on the EUR/USD, I would have ended in profit 'cause in the end the price went as low as .2896....my tp was at .2898........oh well....

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
I got into the same position at 1.9705 and rode it for 12 pips.  Then rogotopo got in the same trade after SRDC advanced and made a few more than me.  I think there were different highs from different brokers today but for most in the TS room there was at least a small profit.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Nice ! My trades for today have already closed successfully !!!!

10 pips on the GBPUSD

5 pips on the EURUSD

5 pips on the AUDUSD

It is 10:30pm ET here in Florida and I had my trades on only for 5 hours...usually I have to wait to wake up in the morning to se anything...

BTW, this is my 5th successfull GBPUSD trade in a row that gave me 10 pips.

GBPUSD: 5 successfull trades out of 5 (+50 pips)

EURUSD: 3 out of 4 (-15 pips, having lost 30 pips on the losing trade)

TOTAL: 35 PIPS

AudUsd is still under studying....

Hi cgldsmth,

The other thing that I have noticed on my Interbank live account is that when  I enter a position, say long GBP,  and price falls below and then comes back to my entry point all of the sudden the pip spread widens from say 3-4 pips to up to 5-7 pips. This happens to me all of the time. I know this happens with news trades but it also seems to happen when there aren't news releases. Has any one else noticed this with Interbank.

--- 帖子 #1130 ---

Thanks to you this is my 2nd day of live trading and already made +5 pips yesterday from audusd long.

Plus +5 pips each on eurusd, audusd, usdjpy all long. Thats pipstatic! I was actually trying to apply sdrc2, but this method is so easy, thats is great! Only problem is the pips today happened whilst I was asleep as I wanted to actually babysit them for more pips. Gaining easy money slowly without having to constantly monitor the market is great!

I must thank OrangeRoshan for his teachings of SDRC, and the people on teamspeak who are very helpful. Especially Traderbill who warned us yesterday that the news could affect the EurUsd as it was about to break out.

Looking forward to some money management guides to help protect my investments. My first 5 pips I gain gave me a profit of $0.05. I cant even buy McDonalds with that! Silly me put a lot amount of .05! The force is strong! But I need more to afford my lightsaber!

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Ribsy,

I you are a beginner you are doing exactly what Master OR teaches you to do. OR recommends that you don't demo for very long (can create bad habits) and start a micro live account. Stick to the rules and work on your winning/loosing ration. He challenges us to make 10 winning trades with only one loss. When you can do that then maybe you can take the noob title off. The key is about consistency and discipline. I would suggest to you that you concentrate your efforts with one pair only. Learn it, make it your friend. Most of us padawans focus on the gbp/usd at the TS room and is OR's favorite.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Hi,

Realism:

(I'm not too sure who the 'we' are to which you refer.)

Anyway, I have read through this thread, and other SRDC threads, several times and have seen numerous upon numerous examples of people who have reported bad trades and have had their comments kindly answered with explanations as to why those trades may have failed. Often a fruitful and friendly dialogue will spring out of such encounters.

(As an aside, I wonder what percentage of "bad trade posts" as you define it have resulted in "only positive posts are welcomed" replies?)

On the other hand there are other categories of poster. For example, I have seen examples of people who have clearly not done any homework whatsoever - surely the minimum requirement for entry into constructive dialogue.

They have not read this thread or any other SRDC thread for that matter, threads which can be easily found using the simple search mechanism at ForexFactoy; or at the very least read the literature associated with this method, which members of this thread constantly remind them can be found at:

OrangeRoshan SRDC method.doc (112.5 KB, 4313 views)
(SRDC1 pg.1/post#1)

SRDC Level II - V2.pdf (856.1 KB, 243 views

(SRDC 2 PG.70/POST#1039

http://www.accrete.com/fx-srdc/

Finally, there is also another category of poster I would like to address, and this is the one who is cleary well informed about trading, who tells of a bad trade (usually an invalid one as defined by SRDC rules), who is then informed as to why that trade failed, who then refuses to accept that feedback and still continues to 'trash' the system.

You are right, OR has put alot of effort in this thread and forum and he should be thanked. But surely he also deserves some level of respect and support from new and long standing members.

We are all here to learn and welcome the opportunity to do so. Nobody is opposed to sincere, healthy constructive criticism.

With respect to an EA, does this help?:

Interesting stuff.  I was on the Teamspeak session just now, going through the losing trade I made yesterday with 4Rex.  It's great to talk it through with somebody else, it helped me to see what went wrong.

My trade was SRDC I Advanced when it broke yesterday's high.  I followed the rules and lost 30 pips.

I realise now that I made a wrong decision:  I decided to be cautious because the price was close to the round number, which could have acted as resistance and so traded the Advanced method.

In fact, what I should have realised is that very often, when a round number is broken, there is a reasonable amount of momentum that generally takes the price up 10-20 pips before it falls back again.

Based on this knowledge, I made the wrong choice of method, I should have used the simple approach, taken the trade when it broke the high and made my 5 pips.  A good learning experience!

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
I also moved from Northfinance (too much problem to withdraw from) to FastBroker and I'm very happy with my choise

And as far I can see gbpusd spread is almost 3 pips for most part of days (it's more when some big news is released but that is normal behaviour of all brokers)

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Thx a lot edcheong for your appreciation

Please could you enlight me about % TS , what do you want to say with that ??

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Good point and you have reasoned well.  If you remember I posted my chart and trade on that break on TS and I was in at 1.9705 and out at 1.9717.  I watched first break and then when it backed up, I jumped in and took the the 12 pips.  If you recall we discussed how difficult tha 1.9700 had been previously.  Point is, that was a problem area to take a trade.

I might be getting the hang of it now...and I trust it will keep up.

Hi Glitz,

I'm glad that you were able to get the Interbank platform working for you.  Now, hopefully, the force will be with all of us come Sunday, and we can make some pips!  Looking forward to it.

Feel free to post any questions as you go along.  We've got a great bunch here who love to help others thru the learning curves.

Good luck!

I'm pretty sure I've been through all the postings by now, so I don't think I've seen this.

Anyone do, or suggest trading both the euro/dollar and Cable?  The last few weeks both trades have been opening at almost the same time, and they stay open and close roughly in the same timeframe too.

Maybe it's a silly question, but would it be more worthwhile to trade two lots(hypothetically) on one pair than a "lot"(quotes in case it's a microlot) on both pairs?  Has anyone ever gotten wiped out on one pair and the other was a take profit?

I like yen and aussie/dollar too.  Trying CAD/USD but orders aren't going through sometimes.

But if eurodollar and cable are doing the same thing, I'm wondering if there's any chance of playing both pairs can hurt or help if they're acting as twins.

I love seeing two pairs take profit too.

Fellow Padawans and Jedis,

Please find below the first draft of a document which seeks to unite the methodologies of both basic SRDC and SRDC Advanced Level I. This process forms part of an effort to get our documentation up to date and consistent and controlled across all systems.

Of course the majority of this document is based on the splendid efforts of Master Roshan.

I would like some feedback on the format and content. In particular, as long as these suggestions fall within the spirit of SRDC, I would like some ideas on how to include information that newbies and even advanced users may find useful. As an example please review post number 700 on page 47 in this thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=700

Personally I think some of the charts could be clearer. Any offers?

I need to confirm with Henry first, but I may also be helping him update the SRDC II document to include CCI, ZigZag, further information on 15 minute, 6th candle etc. So, that will hopefully follow soon.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Thank you for your reply. I was refering to someones post  yesterday or the day before. Have a read. But you are right in most cases people are very helpful. I never denied that. Many people have helped me and you in this forum.

There are many categories of posters. All you can do is make sure your poster falls in the same category as mine, that is the 'good' category.

I still hold the comment I made in my last poster about realism.

Thank you for your links.

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Hi Roshan,

You explain your method soooo... confidently! I know success follows the trader if he follows his method with confience. Thanks a lot.

Please clarify this: The formula you mentioned above ( Fomula: 5pips + spread + 1pip), is it for entering a trade or is it the profit target? (If it is the profit target, then what is the entry point?)

Thanks.

-Chan

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
I believe that he said to include spread AND 1 or 2 extra safety pips and that's it. Adding an extra 5 pips would be up to you I guess......

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
welcome

read the original document carefully and u will find that it is explained in detail.

Anyway heres what i understand
ENTRY for long signal:

High+ 1+ spread

e.g suppose high is 1.9652

spread is 4 pips then

entry = 1.9652+1+4= 1.9657
SHORT ENTRY:

low - 1 - spread

e.g  Suppose low is 1.9452

then 1.9452-4-1= 1.9447

Take profit: look for 5 pips, if u want more there's no stopping

Please be aware of high, lows and imp points of resistence before enetering as described in the original documents

Master roshan says " 0 pips are better than -10 "

peace.

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Well said.

SL is the question-

and TP should be higher if you could do it to compensate for the loss.

I think you can modify this to your own strategy...but OR says no SL, or may be 30 - 50 pips...

But I think if you use less leverage then that would be fine, but then if you use lesser leverage then the 5 pip wont be much either.

Scarry huh?

good point, but still working on the SL.

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
hi

would like to thank OR and everyone in the thread. I m completely new to this forex stuff and i ve been usind srdc in demo for three weeks and in live account for one week. Almost all trades were profit. Been doing this: Buy at high + spread +1, sell at low - spread -1, SL 35, TP1 5, TP2 10, TP3 15. i was more profitable when not moving SL to breakeven after TP1, although i feel safer doing that (can someone with more experience give a opinion on that?)

thanks to all

Hello fellow traders.

Today's GBPUSD trade looks a little tricky, 'cause we are already pretty high and I do not know if it will go any higher....just be careful.

On the other side, EURUSD looks perfect on the way up....it is almost screaming for some serious uptrend...but with these markets who can tell really...but the chart looks fine.

AUDUSD unfortunately went up too quickly for me to even place the trades...oh well, another day I guess.....

IMO EURUSD will do good going up but I am uncertain on GBP's direction....

Have fun

Future

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
I was thinking....what if most people who start using this method become profitable, and then as a result the word spreads around and most world traders use this system....don't you think that some MOFO brokers could start an alliance with other MOFO brokers to don't allow this kind of trading ?

It is scary but once they realize that most poeple trade it successfully they could either increase spreads making it more difficult to catch even 5 pips, or create a new rule on placing orders......

I know, we do not need to be pessimistic, but I know that if this system is the real deal soon everybody will be using it and I wonder how the brokers will handle it.........

Future

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
He.he.he....Mr Future, that's why in my previous post I don't want even to show up my excel calculation, as the result will make the brokers angry and doesn't allow us to trade with this method. Then why should we wait? We are racing againts them now...................LOL.....  Just Kidding !!!

But, there are still episode 2, 3 , 4 and so on from this method..he.he.he..

How?? The high is 2985, and it just now hitting it.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
I use metatrader through strategybulder and my high was 2977.

I had my order at 2981 (spread 3 + safety 1) and got out at 86.....

What do you use ?

Future

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Ok, some numbers now:

I've been trading the system since 1/12/07

GBPUSD - 5 Trades, all reached TP of 10 pips : $500.00

EURUSD - 5 Trades, 4 reached TP of 5 pips, 1 Stopped at SL 30 : -$100

AUDUSD - 1 Trade, Reached TP of 5 pips : $50.00

TOTALS:

TRADES: 11

WINNERS: 10

LOSERS: 1

PIPS: 55 = $ 550.00

Important NOTE: The only loser was the result of the trade hitting my SL of 30 PIPS. However, after doing that it went back in the right direction and ended positively...in other words, without the SL it would have ended profitable.

So far, so good......

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
I'm afraid of it spreading for the wrong reasons too.

Made my first $$ today on euro/dollar.

I agree Cable is a little dodgy, the HOD is right on resistance.  I want to trade yen, but it's soo high I'm not sure how to handle it.  Will it encounter any resistance flying up to these new highs, or will it continue it's uptrend smoothly?

AUD already broke a high of day, but at a 00 it reversed, don't like 00's, always a barrier.  And other pairs I'm testing.  Other than if i touch yen live, guess it won't be a multiple trade night for me, trying to be cautious while building the account.

Anyway, just wanted to share my milestone, and add my two cents to what Mr Future said regarding Cable.

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Thanks to 4Rex for the suggestion:

MT4 emailed an alert, my email system triggered a text message to my mobile, which woke me up at 02.04 GMT to trade the EUR break!

Got my 5 pips, went back to bed and now I can't sleep.  Maybe a limit order would have been better

Back to bed again now, let's see if the GBP is my next alarm call!

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
Congrats.  Were you using a 30 pip SL on the GBP and AUD as well?  Also, would be interested to know if you did limit orders or babysat the trades....

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Hi

I use 30 pip SL on all trades, and all the trades were automatic, therefore I put limit orders, TP and SL all at once and then went off to do other things. If I am on the computer I usually check every now and then to see how it does, but I prefer not to look too much 'cause it can get boring/depressing at times.

I am not baysitting them with the purpose of seeing automatically how well it does. Also, I use 10 pip TP only on the GBPUSD 'cause it usually moves more than other pairs, but 5 pips TP on all others (EUR and AUD) 'cause they move less.

I've been using a TS EA set at 5, the minimum and a pipstep of 1, so moves up with every pip. the problem is quite often it hits 6 pips long then reverses back to the TS of 1. Occasionally I've had it let the profit run to 20+ though. Overall I'm moving back to straight TP5 with SL40, more consistent I think.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
These last days, the SRDC I is working very well in the EUR USD

Some people posted losses in one trade in the GBD USD, in that occasion I managed to get some pips being patient.

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Sorry TB but I must have missed that discussion

What opinion do people have on trading GBP long today, if it breaks?  It looks to me as if that resistance point around 1.9750 could then become support and we have a bit of room before the next level just over 1.9800.  So I think we should be ok for 5 pips anyway?  (Of courses it's got to get through the 1.9750 first...)

I have a slight disadvantage because I'm spreadbetting, and these ****** companies always manage to provide a trade with on average a couple of points slippage, in addition to the spread so I have to factor that in too.

If anyone knows of a UK spreadbetting company that lets you exit without slippage, please let me know!

Hi...most of the times I place only one order, depending on where the new candle opens compared to the old one (is it closer to hi or low).

If the new candle is right in the middle and it is not clear where it will go then I place orders in both directions....but rarely....

I use strategybuilder fx but I am only demoing so far.......

What do you guys do when your highs or lows aren't hit for the day? Do you keep em there or adjust for the next day's high/low?

I think OR is going to end up retiring a bunch of younglings in a couple years just with SRDC I.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
here it is.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
If I read this right:

You mean if, for example, you don't get a trade on the GBP  on a Wednesday (in other words an inside candle), do you still use the  high/low figures from Tuesday for Thursday's trade?  Interesting idea, although I've interpreted the rules to always use the prior day's hi/lo, so I would use Wednesday's.  Also, there's more chance your triggers are going to be hit that way.

And nice sentiment, but I ain't young any more

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Haha. As long as you're young inside, right?

Ah I see. I thought it would be a good idea to do that myself. But Master Roshan mentioned something about more TP if this sort of thing happens. What has your experience been in doing this?

As for me, I've been pretty consistent with the 5 pips to say the least. I'm about 5/6 successful trades with a couple @ 10 pips. I think 10 is pretty much doable most of the time too, but I'm testing that now for myself.

As for Friday, it didn't break out of Thursday's candles on GBP/USD so I was trying to figure out the solution to that scenario.

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
Rodo, Digitalis,

If you do not brake resistance/support "today" based on yesterday's h/l daily candle you start all over again following OR's rules for SRDC 1. Your next possible trade will be the tiny sunday candle @ GMT 00:00 on Monday. Read OR post on this strategy.

Hope this help you

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
There are some great posts in this thread that can really help you master SRDC I.  4rex has been running the SRDC I area in the SRDC Teamspeak room and helping everyone think about their trades before pushing the button.

Trading SRDC I is easy, but if you want to make pips everyday you need to be prepared at the time of your trade.

1st-  Know exactly where your entry point is going to be.  You should know this well in advance of trading time.

2nd- Be aware of areas that may provide support or resistance.  It could be a previous high or low that has been touched many times.  A pivot point or strategic fibo area can also be a problem. Also if you are going long and your break point is at 1.9699 you might want to set your entry past the 1.9700 mark understanding the 00 numbers almost always present a problem.

3rd- You should consider money management when setting your SL and lot size.  Do not trade more than you can afford.  Make sure that your win/loss ratio supports the decision you are making.  Trade demo or very light until you can get that ratio at about 10/1 win/loss.

If you will take just a few minutes thinking about these few things, I promise you will increase your wins and your wins will be quality ones.  In other words, you will be able to duplicate this time after time.  SRDC I is simple but it is not automatic, please just do a little work!

Good Luck.

Thanks Trader Bill for this great reminder.  I'll keep in open on my desktop and read it before trading every time.

I do have a question though....I've read in the thread that we should add

1-5 pips margin, depending on market conditions.   As a newbie, I would like

to know more about how to choose 1 or 2  pips, 3 pips 4 pips   etc.....

Just what am I looking for in 'market conditions?' please.

Also, GBP looks at a critical area.  Should we avoid some trades now?

Thanks much and happy trading.

Post # 27 says entry at 5 pips+ spread+1 at hi or low of previous candle

This post says 1pip+spread..Can U tell which is the proper one?

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
Ok Never mind , I found the answer..It takes much time to read all these posts

I've been trading the SRDC I method for several weeks now. I demoed the method using 3 lots and grabbing 10 pips per trade (50 PIP SL) on the GPD/USD for a week and I had 6 winning trades and zero losing trades. I had zero slippage and earned a full $300.00 on every trade. Each trade went off without a hitch and of course, I was sold on the SRDC I system.

I then started trading the system live, using the same 3 lots X 10 PIP TP, with a 50 point SL. I'm also still using the same broker that I demoed with. I have had 5 winning trades, but I have also had 2 losing trades that wiped out all of my winnings plus 1/3 of my $5000.00 trading capital. In addition, not one of the trades has given me the full profit due to a few pips of slippage on every sigle trade. The kicker to all of this is that the two losing trades should not have happened. They were both results of the broker I was using. I will explain further what happened on the two trades, but I wanted to make this post so that people don't make the same mistakes I have made. In order to trade SRDC I successfully, you have to trade with a good broker. You need a broker that guarantees NO slippage and that also guarantees the spread.

Here is what happened to me on my two losing trades. The first loser was when the unexpected interest rate increased in GB. Because of slippage, I got filled on my entry order over 50 points above my order, and of course, this was 40 points above my TP, so in effect, my TP became a stop loss and it was filled immediately as well, so my order opened and immediately closed for a very large loss. If your broker guarantees no slippage, this can not happen to you. This trade should have been a winner for me, but because of my brokers rules, I came out a huge loser.

The second trade is even harder to swallow, and it happened to me on Friday. Looking back, I probably should have just skipped the trade, but regardless, I think my broker is simply unethical and they stole my money. I had my buy entry order 5 pips above the previous days high. Prices never traded within 10 pips of my entry order, but according to my broker, the spread increased from the normal 4 or 5 pips to 10 pips, and this was enough to activate my buy order, and of course, prices traded down and stopped me out from there. I think the broker simply expanded the spread in order to grab all of the orders that were sitting above resistance and they simply stole a lot of money from innocent traders. Had I been using a broker with guaranteed spreads, this could not have happened to me and the trade would simply not have activated.

The bottom line is that these two losing trades would not have occurred had I been using the right broker, so that's why I am posting this information. I'm not knocking the SRDC I method in any way, as I have seen it work and it would have worked for me if I wasn't trading with such a lousy broker. I plan to continue to trade this system, but not until I get a new broker. With the right broker, I would not have had a single losing trade so far, and I would have gained almost 50% on my trading account in a very short period of time. However, because of the issues I just explained, I've lost about 1/3 of my trading account.

The moral of this story is to choose your broker wisely. Look for a broker with guaranteed spreads and no slippage policies. Do not allow your broker to steal your account as mine did.

In closing, I'm trying to determine if anything happened that would have caused the spreads to double at around 5:30 AM EST on Friday? I honestly believe that the brokers widened the spread just to activate the stops up there, knowing that prices would probably not trade through that level before the weekend. If anyone was trading live during that time and could offer some feedback, I would appreciate it.  SRDC I is very simple and most importntly, it works!  Just make sure you use the proper broker.

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
From your explanation it seems clear to me that you losed those 2 trade due to some big news that did occur when your orders was triggered and suddendly slippage and spread was increased by your broker leading to losses. This is a normal situation that all brokers do.

So next time my advice for you is that you take a look at first page of ForexFactory to see if some big news will occur during day (the red ones are the most dangerous).

I supported TraderBill's post. Chandra is disrespectful and not interested to learn. She/he has other agenda in mind.

Let me make this clear, I dont share my method out of my free time to be abused and disrespected with comments that even a child knows that it is totally disrespectful to the rest who really wanted to learn.

LISTEN, this maybe a free thread for anyone to post, but im moderating this thread with my precious time. SHOULD ANYONE THINK, THAT THINK MY METHOD SUCKS OR NOT PROFITABLE, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LEARN AND STOP POSTING UNCONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS IN MY THREAD!!

THEY ARE PROPER WAYS TO ASK AND LEARN. IM THE TEACHER HERE AND THAT IS  MY RULE. RESPECT AND YOU WILL GET RESPECTED. COMMENT CONSTRUCTIVELLY, AND WE WILL ANSWER CONSTRUCTIVELLY.

DONT COME IN HERE TO MAKE COMMENT WHEN YOU DONT KNOW JACK *** ABOUT TRADING FOREX. DONT WASTE MY TIME AND EVERYBODY'S TIME. I MAY BE HUMBLE BUT DONT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THE WRONG WAY.

I WILL NOT TOLERATE DELIBERATE STUPID COMMENTS HERE. THERE ARE MANY WHO REALLY WANT TO LEARN. SO PLEASE LET THEM LEARN IN PEACE!!

CRAP LIKE THIS MAKE ME THINK TWICE ABOUT TEACHING FOR FREE TO THE PUBLIC. THERES JUST TOO MANY STUPID PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO DOESNT UNDERSTAND THAT IM TRYING TO HELP THEM. SO PLEASE LEARN. AT LEAST TRY!!

Hi all newbies,

If you are keen to learn SRDC I /II

1) You shld have the very basic understanding of what is FOREX, what are the terms used, how to trade, charts pattern, support/resistant,etc, fib; etc.

2) pls read from post 1 to the last post before you post any question. It may be loads of reading, but u are doing urself a great service.

3) Read the pdf provided. It's FREE, what more can you asked for?

4) READ AGAIN so you are sure what are the requirements for entry and EXIT. Its all in the document. so pls do not asked rhetorical questions.

5) Demo trade till you are making positive pips consistantly.

6) Understand that there are no holy grail in all financial markets. And forex is not ur get rich platform.

7) Live and Learn.

Lastly, be thankful that OR and pple fozzy,aha, accentra, dialist; etc are willing to teach and share with everyone of us here.

cheers

mccullek, may i know what broker you are using? since im going to open live acc and i dont want to open the same broker as you did and get the same problem.

If it hard to post it here, you can pm me.

btw it reminds me that Master OR have said previously on TS that if you a newbie, trade demo for about a month and then trade live using minimal lot which is 0.01 lot.

Now i understand why he (OR) said it that way, because the demo and live feed are diffrent at some time, so like you may win a lot in demo, but most probably loss some in live trading. So by using 0.01 lot, you can practice your win/loss ratio and know how the live feed works.

correct me if im wrong.

Thanks.

Hi Orange !

Perhaps you know the story of Chris Gardner who transformed from a

guy living in the gut with his little son to a multimillionaire between

some years.

The title of the movie is "The Pursuit of happiness"

If you didn't watch it yet you have to !!!!!!

It's amazing and very inspirational especially in relation to what we

want to achieve here....

Orange I appreciate extremely what you're doing here for free

A whole bunch of people try to sell their crap for thousands of dollars

to dumb people...

You know that over 95% of the people lose money in Forex...

We want to belong to the 5%

So you made your experience that if you give away your knowledge

for free there is always someone who only wants to disturb and

disturb.

By knowing that I would encourage you to carry on with your fantastic work.

The real guys and gals here support you as much as they can

(You know them...)

I would even pay for this stuff only to prevent us from the dumb

force !!

Happy Pippin !

Dear Ornage Roshan and Trader Bill,

Permit me to post this, please.

I am shocked to note how my postings have offended both of you. I never meant to insult or disgrace you. I was not rediculing your hard work at all! On the other hand, I greatly repected your efforts. If you go and see a couple of my previous postings, you will notice how much I have respected your intellignece and the service you are doing for others. If I have hurt your feelings or talked to you disrespectufully or have taken your valuable time to answer my basic simple questions, I am sorry about it.

I have come from a cultural background may be different from others and so might have failed to understand some of your comments and observations. When I wrote the lost couple of postings ( you have deleted those), I was overwhelmed by your wisdom answering some questions.(Like: how day chart is most suitable for this method of trading, how win to lose ratio do not apply to this methd, etc.). You were trying to drive the concept how this method is unique and how the conventional norms need not be applied to trade this method successfully. I was all appreciative, believe me. I was not insulting you while I was excitedly appreciating your wisdom. Because of different cultural background, I might have inadvertently touched upon sensitive point and hurt your (and others) feelings. I apologize for that.

I entered this site only a few days back and started reading from the very fist posting. I posted some of my own doubts and got good response from the members of this site. Believe it or not, I respect the work done by you and others in this site. I feel that this is the only site that I have come across where people do not boast of their accomplishments. In this site, I see more intelligence, more hard work and no egoistic arguments, no "I-am-right-you-are-wrong experts".

Basically I am a humble man. Yes, I am a man, because my name confuses others whether I am a man or a woman.  I think my two sentences in my previous two emails might have offended you. I do not remember those sentences in their exact form. I am not going to repeat them here. Please believe me when I was writing those words, I was over excited about the success of your efforts and the efforts of others in this site; I never meant to redicule you or others or your efforts or others efforts here. It is a lesson to me to learn how my views of appreciation could turn out to be disrespectful / insulting and annoying to others! I should learn a lesson here.

As time goes by, you will find I am a decent person and the wrong impression that my words made upon you was an accident and unintentional.

I will not waste your time any more. I will stop here. Also, I will not waste your time again by writing on this issue again.

Please post this so that others also know.

Thank you.

-Chandra

Everybody in here knows how much I like this method and how serious I am about posting my results/experiences.

I believe that OR is doing a great job and I am very thankful for his generosity.

However, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot be a complete liar. I did read Chandra's post before it was deleted and there was nothing, nothing on it that was offensive or negative. Actually, he asked questions that pretty much a lot of people want to know but maybe fear to ask.

I do not want to take sides 'cause I am enough old to do that, BUT, this thread cannot turn into a censorship frenzy everytime somebody comes up with questions/issues.

Trust me when I say this, but I have seen many beautiful threads on the web turning into nigthmares as soon as people started deleting every post that contraddicted with them.

It is not democratic at all.

Why not just ingore the posts you consider offensive and avoid answering to them ? Isn't that more mature and less stressful ? You do not like it, you do not agree with it.....then just ingore it, as simple as that. It saves you the time to answer and argue and the time to delete a bunch of posts.

If your system is great, and I am convinced of that, then why fear some comments that may doubt its efficency ? Trust me, if it works, people will know it by trying it on their own. Their are not going to be influenced by somebody's post in here, not at all. So why the censorship ?

I want this system to reach its full potential and I want people to be free to discuss it. Discussion allows for doubts, and that's inevitable and heatlhy, 'cause it stimolates thinking and improvement.

If you have nothing to fear, then don't fear it at all and continue doing what you are doing 'cause you are great, great at it.

Thanks for everything.

Future

My fellow Mr. Future

I did not see the deleted post by Chandra so I will direct my comments to the situation in general.

I am using the quote of U.S presidet Frankling Delano Rooselvet on the title of this post to convey that I don't believe that "fear " is the issue at hand. Let us not make the concept of fear the issue here. It has more to do with establishing a state of mind that is positive and open to learning. One thing is to ask questions of the SRCD method and the other is to question the SRDC method. The premise here is to put aside our egos and work towards our own financial success and that of others. Deleting posts that sabotage our efforts and confuse newcomers is critical to the success and effectiveness of this thread...to ignore them and allow them to saturate this thread can be very detrimental; to a point that Master OR may choose to end his teachings. Learning requires an environment where self discovery turns concepts into skillful applications that we can use in all endeavors including making $$$$$ in the Forex Market.

Thank you for speaking your mind in a positive and respectful manner

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
Once again 4rex you handle the situation will skill and tact.

With all respect Mr Future,

It is your opinion that these posts were not offensive but to me they were. The references to Oranges method flying in the face of conventional wisdom from the likes of Warren Buffett, etc.

I had suggested we get back to the work of SRDC I, but it was hard to do with post after post by Chandra insulting our teacher.

It is Orange's decision and only Orange's as to what gets deleted and what stays. Orange has always allowed people to question his methods as long as it is respectful. Obviously he felt insulted and isn't that what is most important. When he stops teaching you for free, maybe some will wake.

I don't disagree with what you are saying, but I do believe that it is not "normal", and that if you accept it as normal, then you are allowing your broker to legally steal your money. I've been researching this and there are brokers that allow you to work around the news issues. I like SRDC I because it works, and more importantly because you can set the trade and allow it to work by itself so I don't have to babysit the trade. Just because news is comig out, it shouldn't give my broker the right to cheat me.

I have found another broker that allows you to use entry stop orders with limts. As an example, I can choose to set my stop order with a limit of any number of pips I want in slippage. That way, If the news causes a 50 point gap, then my order won't be activated. This broker also gives you the ability to allow your stop loss and target profit to float with the entry, so if you do get 50 points of slippage, your stop loss moves with the slippage as well, along with your TP too. As an example, let's say that my entry order is 1.0000, with a 50 point SL and 10 point TP. If prices gap to 1.0050, my TP and stop loss will move by 50 pips as well.

If I had been using this broker during the big gap in the GBP/USD when they had the interest rate hike, my huge loss would have paid me my normal 10 pip gain, and the loss I took on Friday due to the broker increasing the spread would never have activated and I would be up about 30% in my account right now, rather than nursing my losses. Just because it seems normal with most brokers to have slippage, you don't have to accept it. Search around and see what else is out there.

I have not traded this broker yet live, but I do know for a fact that they have these order types and that others are happy trading with them. Many people don't like this broker because of their charting issues, but I can use MT4 for charts. I just want the ability to control my destiny and their trading system allows that. Had I been trading with them previously, it would have changed my situation to 100% wins with SRDC I up until now. My original $5,000.00 account would be worth around $7000.00 rather than the current $3,400.00.

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
I am sure he is much smarter than that. I really don't see OR turning into another Vegas who used his "generous" and "free" teachings just to turn them into a sales pitch to his subscription website that followed. Yet look at Vegas' thread now, most people are complaining and bitching about his lack of service (and refunds!).

I truly belive OR has a generous motive and I truly hope he will not go in that direction. Not for me, but for him 'cause it will only give him more problems (operating a pay website is a mess). I already know how the system works and I do not need anybody to give me signals or any other crap that I have to pay for.

Let's keep focused on this great system and let's simply ignore what must be ignored.

Peace

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
Apologies accepted.

I dont mind constructive critism even comments, but hear this, FREEDOM of expression is not to be abuse. A healthy learning and asking questions must be positive.

Gentle Reminder to everyone: Forex is a huge Industry. Its not your ordinary business. Its not suppose to be available to the masses but the Internet Era has changed that. Please take this business seriously, gearing towards success and significant. SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW FOREX ALREADY? NO, YOU DONT!! A new mindset is necessary, otherwise it will be just a waste of time. I came from Asia and train by a Japanese mentor who train me with discipline and respect.

In Asia, we respect our teachers. We trust them 100%. When we don't trust them, then we don't follow them and we don't make any bad comment. SIMPLE. Since I started this thread, I would like everyone to follow these rules. Its the only way I know how to teach and the only way I know for a trader to succeed. When anybody have a problem with this, then goto other threads and teachers that permits your style of democracy and rules.

I expect discipline.

I AM NOT ON TRIAL HERE. YOU ARE!!

Therefore, have a taste of Asian style of teaching and respect. Please have fun and say anything you like, but within limits and boundaries.

Now, where were we? Oohhh... SRDC... Yes. Let me teach you how to make money in Forex free of charge!!

Let the learning continues....

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Mr Future,

I read once that:

"One of the most important characteristics of the randomly-collected group is its comparative ignorance of fundamental facts of human behaviour... They should note that it needs no advanced diagnostician to see that people generally use the group for personal amusement in a thinly disguised manner. This is an unwitting act of hostility, in selfishness, towards more sincere members of the group."

Too deep? Possibly, but it explains many things. I would dearly like to discuss other aspects of group dynamics, especially related to the learning process, which would support Roshan's position, but it probably falls outside the scope of FF  .

But, how much of this kind of behaviour would be tolerated within an educational institution, for example? I'm not pointing to the actions of anyone in particular here, but if you want to get a feel for why Orange is trying to care for his threads, there is much to consider. For example, ignoring 'things' can create as many, if not more problems than the original offence. But, such is the condition of the modern world and the modern way of thinking.

"Ignore it and it will go away." (Kinda reminds me of that other saying: You never know what you've got 'till it's gone...)

Regards,

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
Yes, 4rex is right. Its not fear motivated but more on discipline. I dont need compliments, but I would expect respect. Respect for the effort that being put here to teach for FREE. Not asking silly questions and demanding an for answers like we are some kind of scam artists! Its insulting!

I didnt create this thread to be question. But rather to teach. Those who wants to learn and need serious help better behave when they want the teacher to teach.

I have over 100+ 1-1 student whom I teach for free (thru recommendations only), where the majority of them are now multi-millionaires. They don't get to this level by questioning the teacher but rather submiting themselves as they know, the teaches posses knowledge that they want to learn and practice. This is not a democracy. All the deleted post are signals to those who posted them that I don't agree with their attitudes.

In another words, don't come into my class when anyone think what i am teaching is rubbish. Anybody who want to come into this thread and question my method better have more than 10 years of experience and at least 8 digit equity as a start. Otherwise, I think its wise to shut-up and learn. Ive never seen a forum or a convention full of failures. Nobody is interested to hear from them!

All my three Episodes are priceless. At least, pay me with respect. Is that too much to ask?

Thank you.

SRDC rocks!!!!! Thank You Orange!!!!!! JEDI you are!!!!

I almost lost confidence in Forex trading until I started to read Orange’s SRDC I method which is very simple, effective and opened my eyes to a whole new level of trading  , SRDC II & III ties a small picture into a much bigger picture.

I started trading Stock Options and Forex three years ago, did a few courses which cost thousand of dollars, and a few times blew away money in my Options and Forex account but never gave up, I kept looking at Candlestick charts to see where I went wrong, than I found the missing link which tied everything together three years later, now I can trade Options and Forex with confidence, Orange has inspired me, I THANK YOU AGAIN Orange!

I'm looking forward to my first SRDC I Sunday trade tonight, although I don't see the candle on IBFX MT4 yet, I guess it forms at near 24.00 GMT?

I am a little uncertain regarding which method to use, just go for my 5 pips following the basic rule, or play the reverse direction of the Sunday candle.

Any advice from those more experienced (or anyone else!) please?

hi digitalis

can you please explain more about round number?

so if the price near the round number we shoukd use srdc 1 no the advance srdc1?

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Bapho,

A round number like 1.9700 will always act as support/resistance.  So will 1.9750 to a lesser extent.  Anytime you are looking at an SRDC trade close to 00 level beware.

It's probably best to test trade and stay out of live trades to begin with when trading around a 00 price point.  Observe and learn.

Cheers,

Jeff

I was touched by your above post.

I have been working in a local broker in my country as just an ordinary office staff (not a trader) for 7 years. Among those times I had believed that Forex is crap and only make people loss their money  !!!!

I do really mean it when I said that SRDC method (especially the episode 1) has changed the way I see that Forex is profitable with a simple and right method plus discipline. I knew that you must be "something", when I read your words in your previous pdf artice in Tlatomi thread, "Orang Tamak Selalu Rugi" (Tiga Abdul with Tlatomi method), as this kind of words will not come out from a man with short experience in Forex Trading. Pak OrangeRoshan, You've got my great respect !!!! And you deserve more than that !!!

May Allah bless U and your family !!!!

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
for me

respect the teacher, especially in japanese style of teaching, no silly question or comment. otherwise, pancung keparra (lol jk)

no democracy in this teaching.  OrangeRoshan is the only teacher in this method. so, listen and accept his teaching.

Arigato Yoda Roshan!

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Investingjeff has said it for me, I can only relate to my experience day-trading  Nasdaq stocks.

On those, when the price does break through the round number, it generally needs some momentum to do this and will move between 5-20 points pretty quickly, often before moving back towards the round number as the momentum dies.

I haven't been trading forex long enough to know if it follows the same pattern.  I'm going to trade it very cautiously.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
There's a good example today on the EUR, Friday's low at 1.2910, so possible entry around 1.2907 - but would you take it as 1.2900 might well offer resistance?

I'm not sure, so I won't trade it.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
SRDC I was hit again today long and there were pips to be had.  Some are still in long positions to take the rest of the pips SRDC I has to offer.  Try to take all SRDC I or I + trades.

Good luck,

This is my first post on FF, although I follow you for a lot of month. I want to thank everybody, and especially OrangeRoshan. You are sincerely a genuine and fantastic  person.  I am following strictly your method, and I have a question. Do you refresh your monthly/weekly support/resistance level based on last prices, or do you use only the last month/week highs/lows? Thanks for all.

I am trying to backtest EA (SRDC I Advanced V2). It works fine. But, I tried to change the input parameters. But, I cannot do it. I am sure it is a procedural mistake on my side. In short, how can I save the modified inputs (for example, the stop loss) and run the test with new input(s)?

Thank you.

I try to answer any questions I have the answer to, otherwise I let others answer, like this one, since I am not using this EA, I am affraid I do not have that answer.

I find trading SRDC hands on, is sure a whole lot more exciting, and it will help you understand better what is going on.

EAs will keep you from learning the method -or trading alltogether- correctly.

Disclaimer: This is just my opinion, I could be wrong.

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
I agree with you that trading hands on is the way to learn more about the trading method. But, SRDC site is filled with so many versions and releases I lost track of the valid rules of the trade (Do we use entry at S/R or with plus (spread+ 2pips), what stoploss we use, etc.

Now, you say episode I and II work for you. I too would like to trade manually. Can you tell me where can I find the final parameters (latest) to these two methods. I really appreciate your help.

Coming back to  earlier question, (how can we change the input parameters of an EA?) is it nor a common procedure for any EA? My question comes down to "How to change input parameters of an EA for which wo do not have the sorce code"? (as in the case of SRDC I Advanced 1.2).

Thanks.

Chandra,

Every thing you seek is in this thread.  I'm going to give you some of the information but please go back and read Orange Roshan's posts about the system to learn about SRDC1 basic and advanced entry techniques.  SRDC1 basic entry is support/resistance plus your broker's spread plus one pip.

1.9700 + 3pips spread + 1 pip = 1.9704 entry

To see what properties are editable in the EA...attach the EA to a chart, right click on that chart, click "Expert Advisors, followed by "Properties".  If what you want to modify isn't available on the popup window and you don't have the source code, then you cannot modify it.

Hope this helps.

Cheers,

Jeff

I could not but come back to thank you for your help about changing the inputs in an EA. I tried IBFX help and they could not tell me how to change the input values!! I tried your approach and it works. thanks for the help.

Regarding the SDRC system, I am reading this thread and there is so much! This site contains all the information and it is so big! I am proceeding at my own snail pace .

Thanks for the help.

-Chandra

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
Just a friendly reminder.  The EA is not put out by OrangeRoshan and is not a part of the SRDC family.  Skyline was kind enough to write an EA for the group and I have seen many posts about settings.  He also suggests that the EA is not to be traded live.  You are able to experiment with settings and back and forward test the results. Would love to help you more but most of us do not trade the EA.  There is an EA area inside the SRDC threads that may be better suited to your question and my get your answers sooner. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=12136

I hope this helps you,

Update:

I got home from work and found out that GBPUSD gave me 10 pips ! But barely, 'cause high (86) was exactly where my 10 pips TP was.....that was close !!!

EURUSD instead was not able to open any trade.

So, to sum it up:

Since 01/12/2007

Completely AUTOMATIC !!!

10 pips TP on GBPUSD at all times

5 pips TP on EURUSD at all times

30 pips SL on both pairs

GBPUSD: 6/6 Successfull (60 pips= $600.00)

EURUSD: 4/5 Successfull (-10 pips= -$100.00)

AUDUSD: 1/1 Successfull (5 pips = $50.00)

TOTAL TRADES:12

win:11

loss:1

$ 550.00

Future

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
Nice, congratulations

If my theory is correct that the GBP is range-bound and waiting for GDP and BOE rates minutes to be announced 09.30 GMT on Wednesday, you might struggle to make those 10 pips tomorrow.

Have you been taking every trade available, no matter where the price is sitting or whether news announcements are due?

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
The only thing I don't like about SRDC I (and it's a VERY little thing in comparison to what I DO like) is having to stay up until midnight in GMT land to see the day's high/low ready for next day.....

I wouldn't feel comfortable using an EA for live trading.

If only there was a broker who would let you set orders based on the SRDC I rules.... i.e. Whatever the high of the previous day, please add 1 pip and the spread and make that my buy stop order, automatically put into effect from midnight.

Maybe TraderBill can incorporate into his discussions with a certain broker - I can imagine the response!

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
Anyone not going to take the Euro trade?  one site has the low hovering around support, and I'm straddling a fibo on my charts(23.6%).

Made money last week, but I'm a little iffy about the fibo.  I may still go long if the opportunity comes.

Or does this type of question go up a level to SRDC Episode II?? I'm not sure.

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
Hi all,

Just started to read the first few posts for this system.

Great work and i will be starting my journey for learning this great system.

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
The answer, my friend:

SRDC is all about breakout plays. read the method, learn the method, practice the method, express love and gratitude to the fine folks on this thread for their quality work, you will make $$!

Today's quality pips:

EUR +5 pips going south.

GBP +5 pips going north.

GBP/JPY +5 pips going north.

Thanks OR.

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
What time does your daily bar write??? Because according to Interbank's feed, GBP hit a high of 9691 off of previous day's 9685... EUR and AUD are both TBD...

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
what are you talking about? when you factor in the spread it's just not happening. be honest -show proof

I like what the Master is doing but srdc1 is for boneheads IMHO. his trendlines are ok and newest version episode3 is about boxplays. nothing unique- sorry it's just my opinion

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
Greetings Master Orange,

I discovered your amazing strategy the other day and I have since been reading the Episode I thread.  Right now I am getting ready to ready my trades for the night and go to sleep.   Last night I used the strategy for the first time, but due to an error on my part I lost more pips than I gained.  I figured out what the error was, so all will be well tonight.

I have a few questions. I am trying to place my buy limit on GBP/USD right now, however, the price is too close to the line.  Do I go ahead and purchase? or wait for the candle to completely penetrate?

On post 20 someone mentioned back testing in visual mode.  What is the best way to keep track of trades while using that method to test?  Does Meta Trader allow you to make trades on the back tests?

I noticed that you mention Rob Booker in a few posts at the beginning of the thread.  Do you or anyone else know how his training is?  I found his site and I am considering joining his program.  However, I would like to know what you think.

Also, I wanted to formally acknowledge my interest in your system and request admittance as one of your Padawan Learners.

Thank you very much for your time!

-Nathan

In the GBP example the high yesterday was .87 and the high today was .92 so if you factor in the spread and your 5 pip profit, not to mention the extra pips above the high that Master OR preaches- you have violated the trust of the group and shamed your Master and should recieve a public flogging.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
Wanna know what Episode II is? It's Hans123 breakout system with a channel filter thrown in.

Ya know, at one time Honda, Nissan, and Toyota were all the same...

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
To be frank with you Summitfx...

You have violated the trust of your group (you know better which group you belong to, right?) and shamed your Master(Fxtrader777), and should receive a public flogging (for shamelessly promoting someone else's product/services in this thread, without author's consent). It is very rude to say the least.

Hey! There ya go! Now yer gettin' it...

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
When I sit here, and I explore all the indicators that I don't see mentioned much and look for patterns, and try to learn, I wonder how many times this wheel has been reinvented.

There's tons of Big Ben Strategies.  At least I see them posted and not have to reinvent the wheel again myself.

Draw lines for a box, watch for false breakouts.  The difference is you have to find a way to improve it and give it an edge over the other box and breakout plays.  I don't think I saw it mentioned in episode III, but isn't the target profit usually the width of the box?  IE 32 pip range, 32pip T/P traget?  Nothing completely original, but if it tests and works, everyone can learn.

Before SRDC III was posted I asked if you can do this for all 3 sessions and see if you can do episode one more than once a day.  I don't think he stole that from me either.   If it works it works.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
IMHO, SRDC methods are well structured and are great for traders who are new or not new but like to learn some new perspective systematically. I really learned a lot from it.

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
Hi Summitfx,

I am with OR on this one. My experience is that his method works. I am not saying it's foolproof, it needs practice practice and practice. SRDC I works if you don't limit TP to 5 pips, and use channel and price action to help to maximize TP. SRDC II works great in trending market. When market is changing to indecision, the performance will rely on trader's discretion and discipline because it 's not so easy to find the right channel, and not so easy to control yourself to trade only the best setup, especially after you had many good trades when trending. SRDC III works great when you take the SMA 84 seriously, and use the channel as filter. And OR haven't disclosed his pipmaker system yet. As he said, he teachs his method from simple to complicate, from basic to advanced.

Many traders (young or very experienced) in TS said that they improved their trading a lot in the past monthes trading SRDC. I haven't heard anyone complaint yet...

aha

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
I don't really care. While all of his Jedi's are waiting for the box to close at 8'oclock like you, many of us caught the the break of .92 with a buystop.

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
Yeah, SRDC I will catch that too.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
Aha! Shows how much he's read!! SRDC1 had a buystop at 1.9791.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
Summitfx,

Please take your crap attitude and go somewhere else. We don't need you or your opinion here. If this is nothing new to you then you should just move on to some cutting edge techniques like the "paid" subscription area on FF which teaches "price action" trading. Now that's cutting edge trading compared to what we do here in the SRDC.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
What exactly happened with the thread?  I just found this method a couple days ago.  I was very disappointed to find it gone when I came to the site today.  What is going on?

As I could read from your posts you seem to be a very smart guy

So it would be no problem for you to put your aces of wisdom on

the table and share your insights with us.

When you criticise you have also the the duty to show us

something constructive here...

I'm on the way to retire from my daily job soon and do Forex full time.

Orange did and perhaps still does a fantastic job here

(also the whole community).

I'm not here to defend Orange against the dark force.

His work here is outstanding compared to a lot of payed

services in the net !!

Are you dealing with 2000 standard lots per day successfully ??

Do you have a minimum 8 figure account ??

If not you know yourself what you have to do here....

If yes you're welcome to teach us (for free of course !!)

Greetings

Figures that Cable went crazy right after I couldn't stay up anymore.

I want to do a poll or question.  How much do people stay away from trades that are on resistance and support?  I use one site to have a quick look at daily points before looking at the charts, and I find myself crossing off a lot of trades.  Last night 2 trades would've been profitable but I stayed out. One might have went on a lot of economic releases.  Tonight I'm totally out of dollar/yen, though one is around the 00 mark for the daily low..  Including that I have about 4 trades I wouldn't enter unless I become comfortable with the risks.

I just wonder what someones opinion is regarding overdoing it.  Or maybe I'll stay this way until my account has a big enough buffer.

If Dollar yen low is at 121.09, 3 point spread, add one, enter at 121.05...I'd think about maybe doing a T/P at 2-3pips instead of 5?  But then should I really nickle and dime the risk for 2 pips?  maybe when my account is bigger.

After rtracking Sumiitfx's persistance in his action, I feel he has some forceful ulterior interests behid his great effort to disrrupt this thread. From my observations, I think he is a good trader and he is scared that SRDC method, if followed by large number of people, would sabotage his method of trading. I think he is scared that if all of us become smart traders, using SRDC method, there may not be enough traders to succumble to his trading method. He may be seeing the light that SRDC method decapacitates is approach. Hence this earnest effort to disturb this thread.

Best way of responding to his provocations is not to respond at all. How long he can try to calp single handed? It needs two hands to clap!! So, let the gutter  water flow to the gutter. Why do we try to prevent its own ruin.

By responding to his actions, we almost lost OR once last night!

Dear Padawans or Newcomers,

How can there be SRDC without the master OR?

PipSteve/4Rex,

I do not know how SRDC can be taught without the Master.  I know how you feel.  I would be nervous too about someone else pretending to be an SRDC expert.

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
You all are a disgrace to yourselves as traders.  SRDC 1 is probably one of the most powerfull entry techniques I have run across.  Don't know about 2 or 3 as I haven't bothered w/ them yet.  But, ill tell you there is enough in what is already published to become quite skilled at these methods. OR may be back, maybe no;t who knows. But I believe he would be disappointed in his 'padawan's' if he was to read this type of crap. Hope you can pick yourselves up, dust off and get back on that horse. Lots of PIPS out there to be harvested.

I am proud to announce my 8th successful GBPUSD trade in a row since I started on Jan12th.

GBPUSD: 8/8 Trades that reached my TP of 10 pips with a SL of 30 pips.

All trades fully automatic.

That's $800.00 !!!!! But Imagine if every PIP was more than $10.......the sky is the limit !!!!!!

I'll keep you posted on my results.....

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
I will continue to use the methods learned here.  If someone has an easy question hopefully a good samaritian will see and answer.

Some folks need to buck up and move on.  I came to forex from stocks because there's less people and with reason to bash and manipulate, it's too big.  On the stocks we used to say we must really be onto something when someone starts bashing in the many message boards and FAKE newscasts/websites.  Yes, there are fake newscasts and websites geared towards the manipulation of stocks, mostly to create a fake downtrend and panic.

It's confirmation you're doing something right.  You can't have yourself and a large group of others use a system with huge success and let someone get you down.  Reality has to set in.  Especially when the system in question is working better than my other ones which are failing lately.

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Hello Mr.Fortune,

Can you tell us all what exactly you meant when you said "All trades fully automatic"?

Thank you,

-Chandra

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Congratulations - I assume you are placing limit orders when you know the previous day's high/low.  A question for you - do place the order regardless of whether there's any news due, or if the currency is near a support/resistance level?

I'm tempted to ignore and just place the order anyway......

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Hi...yeah I use strategybuilder (metatrader) demo and place stop buy/sell, TPs and SLs all at once, in both direction of the previous high and lows.....

I do not look at news at all, I do not pay attention to prices etc....I just place the orders every day and that's it.

I am doing this on purpose to see in the long run how effective it can be, 'cause it is when I start to pay attention to too many details that I make bad trades....so this time I am just trying it out like this....very simple.

I've got nothing to lose since it is just a demo account, therefore it is worth the try.

So far so good....but it is too soon to talk, 'cause with a SL of 30 pips, all I need is 2 bad trades to wipe out most of my 8 successful trades (800-600=200).

Let's see.....

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
I check for news and resistance and support.  Master Orange somewhere said beware of 50 and 00  psychological levels.

For example, last night I did not take any Dollar/yen trades which I've been monitoring.  Strong resistance and it was at the high around the state of the union.  Price would've hit my buy target, and then retraced and broke the low of day instead.  Price broke the 00 target too when it went to the downside.

Two weeks ago I had a loss on a euro/dollar demo for the same reason. Resistance.

So right now I'm being smart about it.  If my account was bigger I may risk it better.  Apparently not all support and resisitances are equal.  If you go on enough sites and calculators and charts, almost everything is an S/R, so have to figure what to ignore and what not to.

News?  Hope that the broker or order doesn't have slippage.  Works fine for me on demo, but on a real account, I'm not sure yet.

Don't forget money management too.  If I have a loss trading 3 mini-lots, I can make the dollar loss up with a standard lot! Almost.  So risk management there too.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
I only see under 5 people posting in here that often, so I don't know which ones are the wannabe's. I repeated an explanation of what people gave have said or used to answer my questions.  None of which are rocket science...support, resistance, or "anyone having any luck with this method?". You don't pretend to know that much, that's basic.  And pretending worked last night, stayed away from a bad trade!

I for one am guilty of keeping the thread going by posting whenever.  But it doesn't take a genious to help someone out on a simple question or post happy updates about how the trading would be during the week.  If no one else gives someone an answer to something on the beginner level, I'd post.  Not everyday there are vehicles(ie the market) that can make any fool money that doesn't involve slave labor so I do my part.

Talking about trading during news?  Depends on your broker, has nothing to do with being a master.  I'm not mentoring any systems that aren't mine.  These are all basic facts of trading in any board, chatroom or thread.

So if it ain't me, those 2-3 posts were geared at only 2 other people from what I can tell.

BTW:  Dollar Yen was a go when I turned away a few hours ago(1 hr).  5 pips.  Pleasant surprise. I just like the method, it works.

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
Well this confirms OR duped the FF. I know many of you think everything is free but when your doing as much traffic as the FF those dedicated servers can become quite costly. A few OR followers had made a few comments about FF and advertisers ect. Well with out them FF wouldn't exist. A lot of you noobs that are following OR need to ask your self where you found this cat hmmm. In the long run this only makes the FF admin job harder and I have to believe it will be harder for noobs like your self to find good information to come in the future.

I wish you all do well and hope OR not duping you too.

Never seen truer words.  Doesn't matter what you're doing big or small, there's always a thorn.  Some people thrive in defeating those people, some rather just walk away.  Of course I'm not comparing Orange as a great man building Newgrange or Stonehedge or something like that, just anyone doing anything that benefits anyone.

This SRDC is interesting though.  Sometimes you have to read the same thing 5 different ways before things click in your brain, I think it's helping me on other types of trades.

Techno,

I very much agree with you. Somebody must be good at something and bad at something. The intention to help should be appericated so that the idea for improvement can flow. I've changed a lot of somebody original ideas just to fit my stly of trading. Some of them works better for me and if I can share with other members for further improvement...why not.

It's just my IMHO, and I always reserve somespace to myself that I could be wrong too.

Ouch.  I thought today was a guaranteed too.

Least I learned a lesson. No point in doing both eurodollar and Cable if you're not going to spread out the margin so it's not used up.  Both do almost the exact same thing sometimes.

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
Techno,

I didn't get you. Are you talking SRDC1?

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
Yea, Euro/dollar was around the low for hours, and Cable was about 40 pips away.  All of a sudden Cable comes down hard and both my orders go through.  But both don't go down enough to trigger my 5 pips.  Today was a definate day for both pairs to go down.

I used one more mini lot than I was doing this week, not thinking both orders would open at the same time.

Looks like Cable hit the stoploss and then reversed right on it to take profit an hour later.

Because of cable and using more lots than I have been doing(thought it was a "safe night), Euro-dollar was margin called, but only about 9 pips higher than the trade opened.  It only had a 19 pip retrace.

Could've been a good night if I played it differently.  They both did hit the target, although Cable retraced higher than expected and would've hit my 30pip s/l no matter what.  Hard to do too many trades on a miniaccount.

I was keeping a lot of some other pairs I haven't traded live yet, and both of those acted almost the same way.

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
so far i win all the trade by follow SRDC advance method. really cool and simple strategy for newbie like me.

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
How many trades did you do this week in SRDC?

-------

I want to add to my last post, that's where money management comes into play.  Do you trade two pairs at .5 lots to spred out your risk?  Or do you just trade one pair at a standard lot if you know the pair mimics each other?  Money management should help in this pair.  I can make up my loss easy by Tuesday without risking anymore than I have been.

Weeks total

I had 6 trades:

all 6 would've been sucessful.  One hit stop and reverse.

Therefore technically 5 trades were profit for me(I'm counting my mistake margin call as success, as it did reverse after they took a 10pip loss to me, SRDC did work here).

Ignoring Euro-Dollar last night; Live trades for the week:

22pip gain

30pip loss

Pretending I didn't have a fuzzy math mistake(American joke) and counted Euro/dollar as strict success:

27 pip gain

30 pip loss

I'm okey with that.  If I made my stop loss one pip more it would've been 32pip gain 0 loss!  ACK!   That's how it goes sometimes.

No trade Yen on 1-25, already broke highs 90min after new candle, didn't catch it. No trade on Yen on 1-23 strong resistance.

Total all pairs watched if traded all with no worries about margin or running out of money, 5 pairs:

62 pip gain

60 pip loss - losses are Cable on the 25th and USD/CAD 30 pip each.  I haven't traded the loonie live though, just watching it's behaviour to see if it's good to trade.

Without USD/CAD:

42 pip gain

30 pip loss

12 net gain

And without Friday:

57 pip gain

no loss

I think if I traded all those pairs and had 57 pips, I would take Friday off!

By the way, I did not watch nor trade the Sunday candle, so those 57 pips are 3 days, and my trading was 4 days starting monday.

---

I am supposed to use a 30 pip stoploss right?  Also when they say add spread + one pip, will it make a difference if I just use 3 pip spread plus one for all pairs instead of 4-5-6?

Can't wait for next week.  I'll try to be quiet until then.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Techno,

Just couldn't figure it out. GBP low yesterday 9623. So the entry for today should be 9618 ( 4+1). When I look at the chart...I just don't how your SL was hit.

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Looks like I violated rules 3,4.  I thought 30 was the stoploss.

http://techno79.20m.com/temp/srdct.JPG

I entered at the red arrow on the left.  See the retrace right after and hit my stoploss unexpectantly, which was 30pip.

I see you're entry, I put blue arrows for that.  Your trade followed the channel perfectly.  I just wanted my 5 pips for now before I do that.  I was going to take it manual for more pips if it had some force.  I wanted to get as close to 1.9600 as possible originally.

If you heard of the big ben strategy, which deals with specific patterns when Frankfurt and London opens(no need to explain more for SRDC purposes), I think it happened, and caused the price to get to my limit order, and that caused my problem.  Guess it didn't have just enough punch by TWO pips!  For about 2 seconds I was 3 pips in the money.

That's what happened.  If I traded one pair with a higher stop loss, it would've worked out.  I didn't expect cable to fall while waiting for euro/dollar to close out the trade instead of stagnating.  That pair was very flat last night.

Even with the loss, overall it looks good.  Practice my perfection.

Looking at the chart, I should've done some trendlines or channels to better set the stoploss.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
i only start using this method on Thurday. last night was my lucky night. i managed to win 5 trades by using SRDC advance method. i only open 1 position with 0.1 lot per day. i will not open another new position unless first entry is closed. so each time i only have 1 position at each pair. i managed to win 2 trades each on EU and GU when they were penetrating the line at 2nd time. my TP=5 and SL=50. i dunno i was lucky or not for the second win but i will test more the result on 2nd penetrating.

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Techno,

You are right. The big ben entry was a bit higher than the SRDC's entry.

I just lucky to be saved by a bigger SL.

Hello Guru Orange, super senior and senior guys ,

Been following the thread for quite some time now, still practising srdc2 after killing one live a/c with all sorts of ma's. I'll even stick a toothpick to my screen if it will help to show the directions....

been playing with the indicators just now and realised that gbpusd might be reaching critical levels....i.e elliot waves, it's on wave 5 now (so I think)....if so...beware of long positions....

just a silly opinion from a freshie.

Roi.

Where can I find the Advanced SRDC Method PDF?

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
The Advanced SRDC Method documentation can be found at page 46 post no. 688 by OR

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Hasn't there also been a PDF file containing this info?

This is really a very easy way to gain pips.... but one should be careful not to be exposed to the market without SL...

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
I'm showing the 45EMA at the low of day, and sometimes it doesn't mean anything.  But coincidently one of the writers for this site, Aspen Trader also has a short term support at that level.

I don't normally give too much commentary about technical analysis unless for fun in a different sort of thread, because with this method, I'm not always right, and the trend could be strong enough.  It just seems iffy to me with more than one "confirmation" of a bump right at that level.  FYI only.

On another note, Dollar/yen broke it's support that was listed on a site I check, following a good downtrend, gave 5-10 pips while I was doing the nights research.  I miss a few good Yen plays before Tokyo even opens!  I like that pair during Asian session.

Hi everybody,

I have been going through page by page through this SRDC method. I found it's too long for us to catch up everything by going through everything. So i would suggest, the author of this method "ORANGE ROSHAN" would update the newest version of this method on the first post. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
post 1273 page 85 has such a pdf

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
Sorry to say but Orange Roshan doesn't post on this board anymore

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Thanks techno...

For those who been using this method, could you summarize what other indicators are being used for this method?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
no need indicator for SRDC 1,just draw a Hi-Lo line from previous day High and Low.

--- 帖子 #1288 ---
In your experience with this, does it work on the smaller time frames.

It seems to me the one hour would work for 5 pips or so.

Any feed back?

This is very similar to the way I trade the news, with excellent results!

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
It's a interesting system to use,10x for posting it here!

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
yes,u can use 15M for entry.enter when the candle full formed outside the S&R.this call SRDC 1 advance.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
I use SRDC I as my entry as well as adding on positions. It's the best and most straight forward way of trading off s/r. It's very effective

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
how many TP u put normally?

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
So how did this turn out for you?

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
I've been demo-ing the original system for the last 3 weeks and I get consistent losses. I have however looked at trading the EUR/USD with a version of TKimble's "daily scalping method", going for a 20 pip TP and a 20 pip SL,opening the trade at 1700hrs EST in the direction of the previous days candle and this has promise.

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
Does anyone still trade this or have you all moved on to Episode II, III, etc?

I came across this method yesterday and tried it out today. Call it beginners luck, but I am 100% so far. Just can't believe there hasn't been any activity on this tread on 5+ months on a profitable system...unless everyone is gone making pips.

Here are my results from today (needless to say I left a lot on the table):

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
I have had in my arsenal for a while but I never really tried it. Ironically I started demoing it last night

I got +15 last night. On these pairs. +5 pips on eur/usd, gbp/usd, aud/usd

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
Sweet - glad to see it worked out for you.

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
I’m very intrigued by this method. Has anyone followed this strategy bare boned (5 pip TP/20 pip SL) from the time that this thread was started?

I’m interested in seeing long term results of the newbie/barebone version of this… What is your win/lose ratio? Do your winners happen often enough to offset the larger stoploss losses? Approximately how many pips might one hope for per week/month? Rough estimates would be great. I’m just looking for some measure of expectancy of the system if one were to go for 5 pips with a 20 pip SL.

Thanks!

Dahlia

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
... you break even.

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
Well, yes... But Orange has said that your chance of getting 5 pips is more like 99%. Just wondering if those who have tried this over several months can verify this percentage, approximately. Is the true win ratio close to 99%?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
... the allure of going for 5 pips in a dependable manner.  But the fact that this thread is dead and its originator is long gone probably speaks volumes.

There are some really decent methods - covering everything from 5-Minute charts on up to the Daily charts - right on the front page of the Trading Systems section.

I think you'll probably find something that's a little more conventional AND profitable among them that will also appeal to you.

But if the prospect of more losses, but LARGER rewards isn't what you're looking for - it looks like you're going to have to be the one to try this out.

No offense, but I'm not going to comment any more because I believe this thread should be allowed to fade away...

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
Fade away?.... never... here is a re-post of this strategy which I done accidentally. Anyone that is still interested in this can come along and add their views/ experiences.

I personally can see the potential with this system, even if others cant.

Also you say conventional? who wants to go with everyone else? thats worse....

Learning and live trading on SRDC I now. Thanks for OR.

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
Wahahahaha, how in the world did you manage to dig this up ?

Its good stuff here, and i miss OR. This thread is a gift from above to beginners.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
nice I actually decided to try this method today. Made 20 pips today already. It sometimes hard to keep track of all 3 pairs however if your trading all 3 of them. Do you usually put your stoploss and then the limit order at the same time where you want to take profit? or do you watch manually and then put your limit order in after it passes the stop loss?? sometimes I worry it might tank so fast after it hits support or resistence that it might miss the stop loss and hit the limit due to latency issues, have you had this problem? I think this system works great, however I definately think indicators should be used to increase accuracy, even if it was tanking I wouldn't put stop-sell orders unless RSi was at least below 48 and the schotastic lines have diverged

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
hi

anyone knows, what happened to this thread? this is one of the best system out there

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
This system died because it was fundamentally flawed; a 1-5 or even 10 take profit with a 20-30 stop loss is doomed to fail. Orange tried hard but you cannot overcome basic math.

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
Hey Everyone,

New member here. I've been doing a lot of testing of this method, and have a few points which can help sustain this method as being profitable.

1) The SL and TP need to be dynamic, changing over time to best fit the market conditions. Strategy tester can be used to determine the best SL and TP.  If one finds that the best parameters yield a reward to risk ratio R:R of less then one, then the pair is not the best one to trade, and one should look for a different pair.

2) One can use the optimization for the previous week to find the best SL and TP for the upcoming week. In the optimization, keep SL=10 fixed, and choose only TPs which give the best R:R ratio, there are some rules in the decision making. Optimization for longer durations can also ensure your parameters are consistent, but my stop you from grabbing the most pips for that week. But for me, stable profits it what I'm aiming for.

3) The profitability of this method for a particular currency pair is closely related to the 100 and 200 moving average of its ATR.  If this is flat, or steadily increasing, that is an indication the trading method will be profitable. An example of this can be see on the GBPJPY, where it was a loser until the end of April and since then has been a winner for a range of TP's. I have traded the GBPJPY for the past two weeks with profits, and it has been (backtested) profitable for the past 12 weeks. The ATR and the profit curves correlated quite well.

4) Trailing stops aren't that great, as the price likes to retest the previous day highs and lows, and you will most likely just break even, you really need to set your SL and TP, close your chart program and let price do its thing.

The key thing is that one has to add an aspect of optimization to this method to keep it alive, so to speak, in terms of maintaining steady profits.  The method is not flawed, making the SL and TP static is  the flaw. Optimize the parameters and keep track of its profitability on a pair, be open to trading other pairs. and you'll be good.

I've made a string of posts on the BabyPips website showing all my findings, optimization plots etc. As a new member, I'm not sure if I can link to it. But if you search for the thread "Daily Hi Lo" started by TalonD, my posts are there. I was looking for more information on this method that I could use to improve it, and came across this thread.

I'm sorry to see that this method has some how "died", in the views of some. Hopefully, the points I have provided here might do something to revive faith in this trading strategy.

I really like this method, because of the set it a forget it aspect, and its ability to give steady profits. One has to be patient though, as it yields profits over weeks and months.

Cheers,

Synergy

Hi Folks !

Trading Daily High/Low Breakout is one key element in my trading strategy.

It is a psychological barrier which a lot of traders are watching at like

break of 50/00 levels, volume and swing high/lows.

I have a girl friend which is working for an investment bank in London.

Her only job is to pick daily 10-20 pips with substantial leverage.

If this is done by some 100-200 traders daily....

The work is like a human robot......

But its profitable !

So sometimes its really very simple in life......

Happy trading

Bernhard

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
thanks OR for the great and unselfishness sharing of this system, this is really a fantastic system.

just would like to share my results of this SRDC I system using original rules with some own variation (to fit my trading style)

pair: GBPUSD

open buy stop (High + 2.5 pips /alpari UK spread) and sell stop (Low) positions at GMT 0100

SL 10 pips

TP 20 pips

closed position at GMT 1600 if positions not triggered

August (backtested results)

win: 7 (140 pips)

loss: 3 (30 pips)

Total win/loss: 110 pips

based on 3% risk/trade, monthly return is 33%

September (backtested results)

win: 10 (200 pips)

loss: 10 (100 pips)

Total win/loss: 100 pips

based on 3% risk/trade, monthly return is 30%

October (first month LIVE results)

win: 5 (100 pips)

loss: 6 (60 pips)

Total win/loss: 40 pips)

based on 3% risk/trade, month return is 12%

i am now on my way to build up my confidence towards this system by trading with discipline and consistently !

it would be a profitable system in long run.

i do not go into the SRDC II or III as i do not have much time spend to monitor the chart for the pattern to form.

i believe simple is the best and every morning, i just spend 2 minutes to set up the position, then go to work, and waiting my account to put on weight, as simple as that !

thanks Orange Roshan !

happy pipping

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
You're doing well Aeron! Can you tell us how you determine where to put your buy stop and sell stop at 0100 GMT?

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Hi Dreaminer,

i put my buy stop at previous day high + spread

eg, buy stop at 28/10/10 is 27/10/10 day high, ie 1.58650 + 2.5 (as for alpari UK)

thus buy stop for 28/10/10 is at 1.58675

sell stop for 28/10/10 is 27/10/10 day low, ie 1.57290

actually i do not mean to make a variation to original rule, but to fit the trading time to my local time here and to fit my trading style where i prefer higher TP and lower SL and with about 50% winning is sufficient to me already.

not sure if it is appropriate for me to post my result here as the result is not original OR rules results, but i just posting for the stake of sharing with fellow traders here and to show the very simple of SRDC I system is profitable since many many years ago OR trade it.

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
ok I see what you are saying now. Why do you wait until 0100 GMT to place your orders, why not right at 0000 GMT when the previous day is over?

Also, will these be the numbers you use for this coming Monday?

Buy Stop: 1.60360 + spread

Sell Stop: 1.5875

Are you going to try this on other pairs?

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
i have try backtested for last few months and found that the breakout before GMT 0100 is not strong enough but rather fake breakout. maybe you can try GMT 0000 and see how is the results as it is the time where tokyo market open.

i am using alpari UK,

buy stop is 1.60440 + spread

sell stop is 1.58760

i have try backtested on GBPJPY and EURUSD, but the results is not good, the breakout of previous day support and resistant is not powerful as compare to GBPUSD.

Once upon a time there was a man who wanted to sail the oceans with a little sailboat. He left from Vietnam, but suddenly shipwreked near Mauritius..... The boat was broken and he had no money to repair it.

A man who was there asked him: "wath do you need? I'll give it to you!"

The first man said "thanks guy but....why do you help me in such a way?"

The second man answered "someone, long time ago, did the same for me...and now I do this for you!"

The first man, later became the most famous solitary sailor ever seen. His name was Bernard Moitessier!

Now it seems you Roshan are doing the same thing of the second man. You know the feeling of a man when is in trouble, and teach us how to become good traders.

Maybe we won't become as Moitessier (i.e. the best ones) but... we'll sure become profitable traders, and if it will'be, we will have to remember the Master who gave us his science and his experience for FREE.

Then will be our turn to help people in trouble as much as we can.

So, thanks to you Roshan, from the deep of my heart!
