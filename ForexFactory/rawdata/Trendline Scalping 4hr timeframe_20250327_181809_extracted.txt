Guys i have a method which has been very successful for me which i wish to share with everyone else. basically its trend-line trading on a 4hr time-frame.  I win 8/10 of these trades and they happen a couple of times a week.

rules:

dont trade 1hour before or after heavy economic news.

Trade only during Euro start to about 3 hours before New York end.

Look for a bullish trendline on the 4hr timeframe.  After the second leg retracement buy when the price hits the line again.

tp is 50pips

sl is 50pips.

The screen shots attached are examples of this setup

The first one is of a buy setup the second is of a sell setup.

In the first pic the trend is confirmed by the first two legs. a bounce of this gradient on a third time confirms a buy.

Any questions let me know

****************UPDATE*********************

Attached is my Neural Net client for this system, please read the readme file.

How it works

it works on all platforms with 1-click execution orders.

how it works is it connects to my main nnhost which lists the trades.  the trades will be visible through the nnclient and you can choose to  autoexecute them if you wish.  The way it autoexecutes is via mouse  clicks and remembering where the buy and sell buttons are on your one  click order window. so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these  trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that  trade and auto trade it(when it hits the line on the 3rd bounce) if they  choose. if you dont want to autotrade it you can just use it to view  which trades i will be taking.

Trades are only for this method described in this thread.

Once connected it will auto update itself with upcoming trades

I have also tried a screen video though teh quality is pretty bad so i have included in a text file what is on the screen.

Youtube URL: Inserted Video

apologies for the clarity i didnt have time to learn camtasia

Enjoy!

Fresh, New and Nce!!!!! I trade price action using TL and fib patterns, so i'll be interested in following this thread.

But, kindly give more detailed explanation on what you do[how you determine a bounce off the TL, what candle formations you look at, which of the TL you consider-inner,outer, long term TL, etc], which pairs you trade., how long have you been using this method, and give your trading time period using GMT

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
sorry dude ill post a more detailed screenshot shortly.

How i determine a bounce?

i look for the low on a bull market, i wait for a retrace, then once the retrace has ended and starts heading bullish again(and stays away from the retracement level for more than 8hrs) i consider this to be the second leg of the trendline. i will then draw my gradient line on these two legs and buy on the 3rd touch.   New screenshots shortly to come..

Hi all, I am also using this type of trade on any timeframe and am starting to trust it more because these ones seem to work without too much of the dreaded drawdown associated with usual breakout trades.  I don't use a fixed TP because I want to be more greedy and more precise.  For my initial TP, I Place a Fib from the top of the first candle (for a short trade) in the "3 in a line" setup and the bottom of the fib on the bottom of the 3rd candle.  My TP is the 132% extension (+spread for a short)  This is the most guaranteed target.  If you want to get greedier, I look to see if this target point would naturally trigger another Fib trade (i.e., breaks another swing low or candle low).  In this case it triggers the pink Fib - see second pic, whose 132% ext is at 0.8454 and a profit could have been taken there.  You notice that it makes a retrace at the 138.2% at 0.8450 and came up to just touch the new TL (Yellow) without breaking it, so I shorted it again there!!!  The new target will be the 132% ext of the yellow Fib at 0.8437+ spread...

Regards and pips to all, Chris

PS: Anyone watching this live will see that my greed has got the better of me again and stopped out my trade.  However, there is a new H1 touch of the bigger TL now, so have re-shorted with a new target area of 0.8421 + spread (new yellow fib)- fingers crossed.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
chris nice charts! thanks for the screen uploads. great to see that im not the only one that has noticed this pattern. Yes its true can always aim for more pips than 50.  Whats your success rate if you don't mind me asking?

regards

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I'll suggest David explains his method in details so we could have a better focus on just one method here on this thread...except if he's confirming your method to be the same with his....so we do not have ''method overload'' which eventually only leads to a crash...

Care to answer other questions i asked David?

Thanks for your understanding

--- 帖子 #7 ---
ok guys i have added another pic at the top of this thread.

The confirmation of the gradient legs are labeled 123 for both bullish and bearish trends.

so the time elapsed between the legs is usually greater than 8hrs. when the price moves away from the second leg say for example a bullish trend it will move upwards.. it will move somewhat a hundred or so pips stay around that mark or increase for a period greater than 8hrs then when it the price comes back down and touches the gradient line(drawn by the first two confirmation legs) you buy(or sell if its a bearish trend)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
just another question guys(unrelated to this thread) i am new and would like to know who i ask for permission to upload a neural network client that i wrote in c++. its a medium frequency auto trader which i wrote and would like to share.. i can supply source etc if people are worries about .exe??

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Why would you need permission? You wrote it, and presumably you didn't use any proprietary content, so upload away. The source code to the .exe would certainly make it easier to make sure there are no security threats, if you don't mind of course.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
thanks ronald i will! just didnt want to break any rules... ill tweak the code a bit and upload shortly to a new thread.

thanks for the response

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Took a USDCHF 4hr trade today and it paid off.  I entered short at the opening of the candle after the bounce candle [highlighted with the yellow eclipse and labelled 3]. first chat

stop loss = the top of the bounce candle formation + 20pips[buffer]

TP1= the no of pips between the top of the bounce candle formation

and  the opening candle

I then adjusted my trendline as necessary. as shown in the second chart..

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Excellent work buddy! thats pretty much all there is to it. very successful method of trading applied to all pairs and all timeframes(i have had best success with 4hr)...   its also a part of my neural-net which has added to my success..

--- 帖子 #13 ---
A set up in the making for GBPUSD 4hr tf[will complete in the next 3hrs]BOE interest rate news would have seattled by then.

If the present candle ends up bouncing off the TL, then we might have a signal....if not, look forward to the next Trend line[outer trendline]

N:B

A present 1HR signal is doing marvellously well

--- 帖子 #14 ---
certainly looks like a setup though having a look at the gbpusd the first bull confirmation of the three leg setup occurred on the 20th of may. i only usually take one long trade per gradient confirmation and it looks like the gbp has been bullish since this date.  Doesnt meen to say that this trade wont work out looks like its def finding some resistaance at this level just the more trades you take on a trend the less likely they perform.  price for me currently on gu is 1.5134.

you taking this trade?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
anyone catch this one. this one was a great trade. sorry didnt post earlier had to go through my logs and find out where exactly my neuralnet executed the trade(as it was done automatically)

i have circled the 3 legs please disregard the other lines

--- 帖子 #16 ---
What pair and time frame is this? You have an EA for this method?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
quote is gbpyjpy on 4hr time-frame..  no not an mt4 ea but a c++ neural-net which i coded a while back ill upload the client hopefully by the end of the weekend though it doesn't just take 4hrtrendline trades it looks for others aswell(equally as successful)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
EURJPY set up for a SHORT signal.. daily time frame is setting up, so also is the 4hr tf which has actually given a short signal Entry @ 112.10 for a 56 pips target. Aggressive traders might come in at the 4hr tf [not doing too well now, but might actually be a better entry for those just seeing it now], while conservative traders might want to wait for the daily tf signal for further confirmation.

Sorry i cant post charts now, i'm not on my ''analysis'' system.. will do so as soon as i can.

N.B.

All signals traded went well yesterday

--- 帖子 #19 ---
dont know why you entered here, would like to see your charts

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Back on my PC now.. let me post my charts..

First is the 4hr tf, Second is the daily tf... The 4hr tf is at a S/R zone, which makes it a high probability turn around..will still look to trade the daily if all things work well...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
very nice dude! as i can see its working out nicely... nice clear charts aswell.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If guys are interested, we can set up a live trading room where we all see and perhaps take trades together live and direct..

Posting here on the forum can be challenging atimes, hence late posting and infact, i dont get to post all of my trades here....  What do you say Dave? Its your thread

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Whats your suggestion for the room,  i will definately be uploading my neuralnet client soon i just need to make some adjustments to the source before uploading to FF.  It lists all the upcoming trades for this method and has teh ability to buy and sell for you if selected, otherwise it will just display what price to enter and the rest is upto you.

It also lists other trades which i take(though an option to disable their displayment is available)

what do you think of this?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Sounds great - thanks

--- 帖子 #25 ---
that will be very nice of you..I'm suggesting skype, but if any one has a better option, then we look at which is best...

Done trading for this week..Hope you all had a profitable week..I did.. Wish you all a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #26 ---
its difficult to spot , identify the trades at exact time manually. we need some software to help us on this, otherwise we may miss some trades. hopefully davids indicator will help us.

its a good idea to have a chatroom ...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
The Skype chatroom would be a good idea...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
well, with a little practise, you'll be able to spot, identify and take trades manually with ease..notwistanding, am not against the use of 'robots' if it suits you..personally i dont use any... [I trade price fib patterns, monitor 24 pairs and i spot my trades manually....] perhaps Davids neuralnet might succeed in changing my mind about use of robots..lol

--- 帖子 #29 ---
guys heres a screenshot of the neuralnet. sorry i havnt uploaded the full code yet, still tweaking the code and i havnt had much free time as i am moving houses..

As you can see it shows trades in realtime, theres an option for autoexecution for when the price reaches that level, this can be disabled.

THeres an option for audio alert which plays a chime when enabled.

Also other trades i take can be displayed if wished(also can be disabled)

let me know what you guys think of the gui

cheers

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hello David,

Thanks for the thread and your interest to share your trading methods with all of us. I look forward to seeing your c++ code for your neuralnet. Could you post the code as a beta version or something while you still work to make the code better? I would great if you could also upgrade .exe version as well.

cheers

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Welcome to a new week..  I just want to scan thru my charts and post possible trades that might happen this week...

Start with GbpUsd..4hr tf

Market broke the up trendline which indicates a high likely hood of the market falling and good enough we have a down TL (blue line) already with a 1,2 point..so here i'll patiently wait for a retest of the TL for a good SHORT signal.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Looks pretty cool so far David...What it be possible for you to also add an email alert as well?  TIA!  :-)

--- 帖子 #33 ---
once again great chart.  This is a valid setup short i believe for the ggp/usd

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Just gone Short on EurJpy..based on daily TF... for a target of 56 pips.

I pray it ends well..Its always good and boosts my psychology when i start a new day/week/month with a good trade..

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Dave..yes its a short for the GbpUsd

--- 帖子 #36 ---
i only usually take gbp/jpy trades but took this one anyway cause it was a good setup. very good start to the trading week

how did you go?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I'm in EurJpy Short..based on Daily TF...am still waiting for the GbpUsd short on the 4hr tf...

I  usually dont trade this method on daily..but decided to starting from today..lots of opportunities missed on the daily tf..look at EurUsd for instance...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
hi D liberators, where is your entry point ?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
lots of opportunities indeed.

This method is the prime method which made me successful in forex..

wish everyone else the same success!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
112.127 [ALPARIUK]; 112.096[FxPro]

--- 帖子 #41 ---
thanks D liberators

for daily TF, wou keep same 50/50 SL/TP ? I think we would need a higher value

--- 帖子 #42 ---
yes you are correct, its a very good system by itself. if we add confluence then it becomes more powerful.

there are several flavors of the same system.

1. on 3rd occurance, i immediately place a order in the direction of rebounce.

2. on 4th and higher occurance, i wait for the current bar to close in our direction and i place a limit order at close +5 buffer, with stop as bar low + buffer and tp as recent swing high/low - buffer

3. on 3rd or higher occurance if TL is broken, then i wait for a retrace to 50% of bar and place order away from TL. that means if TL is broken from top to botom, then SHORT.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Nop i dont use 50/50 SL/TP as dave, does...i calculate my TP1 and SL differently[posted how on page 1 i think]...some use fib ratios.

Actually i trade price/fib patterns and i calculate my tp based on resistance/support levels, fib extension, and sometimes just 'guts'

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Target hit on EurJpy.. The pair still has more room to move down..but on this strategy am out because this is a high probability trade, i risk so much of my equity [wont say how much] and scale out quickly..56pips isnt bad to start the week with, especially when you are more than 5% up on your account..lol

Next pair am watching is EurChf short..will post chart later..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
EURCHF is on D1 or H4 ?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Roundrock

I think 4H, zoom out and have a look at the trend line from 21st May 2010.

By the way Dliberators, I like the simplicity and high probability of this system. Thanks for sharing mate.

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #47 ---
thanks Ezzy, drawing TL is an art i guess. sometimes we dont know how far we need to go back

--- 帖子 #48 ---
No probs roundrock.....I've been there too.

Cheers mate.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
drawing trendlines is kind of like an artwork. i hope to have some new screeens uploaded soon along with my code..  I spent hours each day watching the market for an entire year(6-8hrs a day) which enabled me to spot this.  This is how i developed this method..

so yeh its kind of an artwork but an easy artwork

4HR..HERE'S THE CHART

--- 帖子 #51 ---
David owns the credit buddy..He started the thread, i'm just contributing to it and will like to expose more of what the big boys do but only in a live trading room...still wating for what you guys got to say about the room..

--- 帖子 #52 ---
My apologies.......thanks David for sharing. Thanks DLib for your contribution.

Regarding a trading room, I will be interested. Chat room would be good, I've neved used skype but am willing to give it a go.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I am currently demoing.

Just wondering what people thought of this set up.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Dave and the guys out there.I want to say a word of appreciation to David for this simple and efficient system.The catch is in its simplicity.

Regarding the trading room or chat room,I think chat room is simpler.All everybody needs is a Skype ID.

To all following,I say,have a pips filled week

--- 帖子 #55 ---
thats the way to go buddy..your set up looks perfect to me...though i would have waited for the last candle to close and show a bullish bounce off the TL..am usually careful when i see a bearish candle in a long set up..this is an aggressive approach you have though and will give more pips than my approach..but also more dangerous..lol

I'm attaching a link to where you can access a little write up i did on How to draw trendlines...hope this will be of help to someone out there

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=804

--- 帖子 #56 ---
ezzy, yes that is correct, if you bought of the third bounce it would of been successful. check out my chart its different, but same result. i.e a win!!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
you're the man

For those who trade 1hr tf..here's an upcoming signal if we see a bullish bounce off this tl..

--- 帖子 #58 ---
do you wait for this candle to close as green before you enter ? or wait for next candle to close above TL to enter ? or you will enter on touching TL without a confirmation ?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i tend to stay out of the lower time-frames.. hope for all the best buddy..

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I actually dont trade 1hr with this system, just posted this for those who do...i do wait for candle to close before taking trades... a candle's story is not complete until it closes..using this as an example, i'll prefer to wait for the candle to close as bullish candle off the TL...and that did not happen.. so no trade and price proved us right.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
guys, any progress on chatroom ?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
possibly setup a skype chatroom or a mirc chatroom. ill work on that one after i get my code uploaded(priority)

anyways i have just entered a trade i know its still asian session but i like the setup.  i decreased the lot size hope it works out the scrren is of a daily gbp/jpy and i entered at 133.05

my tp is 50 sl is 50

lets see how this one goes

--- 帖子 #63 ---
ok Dave...your trade, is it long or short..can you reload your chat so that it comes up properly...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
its a long trade. ill upload a new image shortly. i entered prematurely ideal entry would of been around 132.95.  we will see how this one goes though

--- 帖子 #65 ---
david486, thanks for the chart

it looks like all the legs are so close on the gradient. i read one rule (for 4h) that the 3rd leg should be atleast 8 hrs after 2nd leg. here i am seeing 2nd, 3rd legs are consiquitive bars.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
is there a indicator which draws the trendlines..connection previous 3 points?

thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
time has passed on this chart, its a daily chart so each bar is a day.  its a daily trade sorry for any confusion.  i liked the setup so i entered and thought i would post.  i did decrease my lots because i dont usually take these trades during asian session.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
thanks david, i did realize this is a daily chart, thats why i asked that question.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
yea, i think GJ will head down a bit before going up..i'm waiting for a bounce to go long on daily too...hope your trade goes well though.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
i would tend to agree. its only $1 a pip for me on this trade.  nothing in comparison to my standard lot size.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
well exit +10pips not so bad. but shows must always be vigilant on entries. even seasonal traders like me can enter too late.

more setups to come and hopefully ill have my code uploaded tonight. just ironing out some bugs i.e cpu usage..

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Good Dave...missed this golden opportunity..just posting it for educational purposes..

--- 帖子 #73 ---
on my feed (fxcm uk) i dont see this clearly. in fact AUDUSD is on my radar

--- 帖子 #74 ---
anyone watching this ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
+1 (FXDD)

Great thread guys!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
What about this ? already EJ was shorted recently by D liberators

is this a valid setup for long if it closes above TL and starts showing some bullishness ?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
short oppurtunity here... but the stoploss has to be tight as we have long TL nearby

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Likely trades.....UsdSgd short 4hr tf

I'm short on this

--- 帖子 #79 ---
was just going to post this too...good trade Roundrock..pray it goes well..am short this and UsdSgd

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I would prefer a bullish candle to bounce off the TL and not a bearish candle regardless of it closing above the TL or not

--- 帖子 #81 ---
what about this ? shall we wait for a red candle on H1 ?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
ok, got it. so if the next candle CLOSES as bullish candle, then enter long ?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
i am afraid of the spread in USDSGD.

its going down pretty hard

--- 帖子 #84 ---
yes i am.. If your candle closes as a bullish candle, its good to take the risk

--- 帖子 #85 ---
From your chart, can see there's been a 3rd leg on that gradient before and if you'd taken the trade would av been profitable..

What i'm having on my chart is diffrent (FxPro)..still watching the pair for a signal

--- 帖子 #86 ---
roundrock good spotting d lib is right!!

guys let me know how your usd/sdg trade goes i dont have this pair..

--- 帖子 #87 ---
guys i also have a bit of dilemma. i want to post the exact levels to trade at on a scalp gradient(within the neuralnet client) though i cant give a specific rate as when the price hits the gradient again there is no specific rate..  what i can do is tell you exactly where the first two legs are.  I am thinking of also adding other fx pairs

please let me know your ideas as i will be releasing the first version shortly and i wish to incorporate everything..

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi all

I am sure many of you are probably aware of this one.....but just in case, this one is looking as a potential set up.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Great thread.

Watching: ACAD 4hr, GU 4hr.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
aud/cad looks like its expired(second last candle already bounced) would of been successful by the looks of it.

gu looks valid.

good work. your getting the hang of it!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi David, I don't understand your last post. On ACad I am waiting for the current 4hr candle to close. If it is a bull candle, then I will enter long. The second to last candle was a bear candle and only bounced about 7 or 8 pips.

Don't we wait for candle close before entering a trade?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
hey fourkids and thanks for your post.

on my charts it shows a direct price bounce of the trendline as it does with yours. i dont wait for any particular candle to form on the third bounce to make a purchase decision i just enter(except if there is pending news coming out).

however this doesnt mean you shouldnt, if that makes you more comfortable then by all means...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok Thanks. Does that mean the second to last candle which bounced for a few pips was the 3rd bounce and now the set up is invalid?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
hey, Four Kids,  coincidentally, I was also looking at these two pairs, here are my charts

GU, I am looking into TP of 1.5200. currently, set stoploss to BE

AC, still with uptrend, TP might be 0.9100

just a different view for discussion. TL is very difficult to trade with, but, it seems one of the most useful tool, according to Al Brooks (I am currently reading his book, very interesting). however, still trying hard to find a solution to use it effectively

jeurre

--- 帖子 #95 ---
according to the rules from the beginning these charts look like they would of won according to the 3 bounce rules, well the second anyway not sure what the first chart represents

--- 帖子 #96 ---
On the contrary, TL remains one of the easiest tools to trade with, all you need is to know how to draw a valid TL and get used to it...

I've seen a lot of wrongly drawn TL [even in this thread] and more often than not, you get your fingers burnt when you draw TL wrongly...

I'm yet to have a loosing trade on my TL based strategies for this month... You can get a simple, easy to follow write up on how to draw an effective TL on page 2 or there about of this thread.....

Happy Pipping

--- 帖子 #97 ---
just about to reply then i sore your post. i couldnt of summed it up better.

Agreed on all points.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hello david486, do I think right that you are not awaiting third touch/bounce candle to be closed before enter? thx

--- 帖子 #99 ---
you are correct, others do wait for the closure i dont. doesnt mean its wrong basically whatever works for you.  i used to miss a few trades when waiting for the closure candle.  The Closure candle is also a good way to enter.

**update neural GUI**

ok so this i what i have configured so far.

listbox view with trend line setups, per entry there is also a checkbox where if checked alongside autotrade(while setup properly) it will execute the trade automatically..  This is for my neural app for those who are new.  The source code will be upp'd aswell, im not going to lie its very messy but it will work 100%

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Thanks, D , I am glad to know trading TL can be easy

jeurre

--- 帖子 #101 ---
waiting to close below the TL and a bearish bar...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
if you were referring the first to the GU chart, it is a trade into a retest of trendline, probabily a bit weird though

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thx david, if not awaiting close what do you think a bounce plz? 20 pips, 50 pips? or a time limit?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Looking forward to your neural GUI david. Thanks

--- 帖子 #105 ---
both hit targets, i am done

[quote=jeurre;3871396]both hit targets, i am done[/QUOTE

so you made 50 pips on both? nice if u did!

actually, i view TL and S&R as same thing.

[quote=D liberators;3871502]Is this based on Trendline bounce? cant see any trndline bounce on this pair...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
In my view and experience so far, they are actually not the same...to avoid distraction and unnecessary confussion, i suggest we stick to posting charts or trades that has to do with the strategy as described by the thread starter... I do see a lot of wonderful threads that get clustered and confusing after a while just because other traders post what is not in line with the thread's strategy...This system is highly effective as simple as it is described by Dave, and i'm sure we dont want to give this thread a premature death..just my own view..

Missed this while in traffic on my way to the office...

great setup, i missed this one too.. actually chf/jpy is a pretty good performer i was thinking of trading both the gbp and chf when i first started. will monitor trades and will probably start trading them to!

well, not a problem for you to stick around with the thread strategy. didn't intend to confuse you, simply responded to your curiousity . good luck with your scalp shop

Here's the chart

--- 帖子 #117 ---
guys i entered a short during the asian session about 8 hours ago for 45pips.. i had relaxed my rules on my neuralnet and it autoexecuted while i was sleeping. glad to see another win!

attached is the chart i entered at 135.46 for a short.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
nice work fourkids, what was your entry?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes. I use FxPro for charts.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I missed the the initial bounce, but decided to enter anyway. Got in at 135.37. 2nd part stopped out at break even.

If I had of entered at the initial bounce, 50to 60 pips would have been banked, and the second part would still be open.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
thanksD liberators for putting this list. i will add GBPJPY short on daily

--- 帖子 #122 ---
anyone enter d lib's short trade on the gu? ifso what was the entry?

Hello david486, i think you miss my question some posts back so I hope your ok with me to post again. Thx

--- 帖子 #130 ---
liking this setup d lib.. looks good i think i might take it with decreased lot size, well spotted!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
driftwood, i apologise about that!  if your refering to my entry upon the third bounce some like a confirmation candle before entering. i personally enter as soon as the price his the line.  my method is a bit riskier though i dont miss trades.

Hi All,

This is my first post on here. I have been watching this thread with interest and took the plunge last night on the USD/CHF 4hr chart. I went short with a 40/40 stop/limit. Collected my pips in a couple of hours so thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
looks like in the screenshots all were triggered and successful except for the last audusd one(which wasnt triggered) based on the one touch trendline rule. am i correct?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
wow, we got five stars for the thread !!! great going guys....

--- 帖子 #144 ---
great work.. glad people are liking my method!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
great work d lib

heres one on the gy 4hr im waiting on.

its a short when hits the line..

--- 帖子 #146 ---
looks like a short coming up

--- 帖子 #147 ---
hi david, congrats on the five star rating (to d lib and others too)

i have seen you are tracking only GBPJPY. is there any reason for not tracking other pairs ?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Sorry to bother you all with this...just wondering why my ACAD short stop loss was triggered..Price never got near it and my broker's spread for this pair is 7...What happened?

Trade should be in profit now if not closed....

--- 帖子 #149 ---
d lib, call your broker. im afraid this is the problem trading with some market makers. as sson as they see a trend of profitability with a client the execute stops etc.  thoguh it could be just a mistake, how long have you been with them?? if its malice on their part they should be reported..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
d liberators thats ridiculous... call your broker now. i have my broker open and it never hit that price. i have exited with +30pips..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
thats wierd.... mine is still running and in profit..

hows everyones trading going tonight? my tp was hit, another great week.

d lib did you sort out that bollocks with the broker closing you out on the audcad?

as for a skype room sounds great, should be sorted by the weekend with all my moving.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
david, my GY trade hit SL at 135.60, price just touched that pip and dropped 100 pips in 5 min !!!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
hello roundrock, this like for me to. Best low I see be 134.64 bid then up to hit sl and drop.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
if next candle closes bullish, we can go long

--- 帖子 #158 ---
It looks very useful for me. Does this work on all pairs ? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
where's the origin of the the trendline?..seems we already had a 3rd leg bounce on this gradient, so u got to be real careful on this one..

Lost my ACad short..no thanks to my brokers error.. cant freak me out, gonna nail them real hard..lol   Dont mind me just bragging..lol

--- 帖子 #160 ---
you didnt apply the 20pips buffer above the top right?  Its important if you're not using Dave's style of entry...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hello guys..am looking at the UsdJpy for a likely LONG trade.. to back this likely trade up is the fact that there's daily support at the 87.25 zone which is close to the TL..

--- 帖子 #162 ---
ouch..yes i see.i was lucky my broker price didn't reach my stop..

still cant believe what d libs broker did. such a scumbag move. anyways there will be more trades to come.

can anytone tell me what their success is like on other pairs. i have only been trading gbp/jpy?

i would like to know because by monday the neural should be released and i might add a few other pairs for those that are keen.  for less liquid stocks a tp and sl of 50 pips will have to be reduced to like 20 or 30.  anyways let me know your thgouhts.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
this is david style trade, 50 pip TP/SL on touchdown of TL. no buffer. it just kissed my stop and reversed 100 pips in 5 min :-(

--- 帖子 #164 ---
D liberators, i didnt know that each gradient can be traded only once and thats 3rd leg

is there any reason for this ? the more and more price toyches TL it becomes weak or strong ? my understanding is if TL has several legs, it gets stronger, rather than just joining 2 points. but i need a good swing between each leg. the bigger the swing, better it is for TL

--- 帖子 #165 ---
All on 4hr tf..but i'll be tweaking this a little by watching for entry on 1hr tf...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
nice dlib.

here is my gbp/jpy 4hr tl trade.

its a long on the hit of this trend. usual tp and sl of 50pips

good luck all, will be looking for a short setup aswell

--- 帖子 #167 ---
with all JPY pairs falling, i am sceptcal of this right now, i already have 3 JPY pairs on trade (all long). good luck to you david

I need help with drawing TL, see the picture i attached below, there are 2 lines i made, the chocolate line is the same as d lib line.. my question is, the red lines that i made is also correct or not..

thank you.

nb: sorry my english is bad..

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Why is the market so slow..can you all kindly place orders so market can move pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease..still need to bleed 120 pips from the market today...anybody got excess pips to give me some?.. Is there any way we can manipulate the market like the big boys do?..who really are the ''big boys''...

I need more .lol

Mistakingly took AUDCAD instead of AUDCHF..good mistake though..seriously thinking of switching over to ''Coin flipping'' style of trading.....think i can make more money with it? hmm

--- 帖子 #176 ---
this is brilliant.. i tool this one to for 40+ pips.. its like ive gone from losing to winning all my trades...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Though i cant see it very well.. looks ok to me [thats the ideal TL..having the full ABCD leg. The TL used in this strategy is not necessarily the textbook TL..some cases you are actually anticipating the CD leg...

You may want to go thru the little note i wrote on how to effectively/correctly draw an ideal TL. And when we eventually get the chart/trading room going, you can be sure of getting a step by step walk thru on how to draw a TL.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I'm happy for you John..Welcome to the club of successful forex traders. With discipline and patience, this strategy will give 85-95% sucess rate... I'm really happy to hear this from you...i get fulfilled when i hear things like this...

Guys i bled 40 more pips..so i still need 80 more pips... pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease place orders so market can move more.. i need more money...got back my loss of yesterday.. Alpari uk is in trouble with me..lol

Adjusted TL on chartsand now have 19 pairs on my radar..will post as signal matures or get close to maturing on any of the pairs....GbpJpy seems the most viable for now..we might have signal in both ways later today..men i smell

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you very much.. now i get it.. but still need a lot more practice.. hope this thread can give more and more example every day so that i can follow and study more..

Please let me know if the trading room or group chat has been made, because i really want to study this TL method.

once again.. thank you..

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Any update on the skype room?  I just stumbled across this thread and i have been trading a very similar technique.  There's nothing better than trend lines IMO.  Looking forward to learning and contributing.

Greg

--- 帖子 #181 ---
David et al,

Price, on the 3rd touch, actually broke through the TL by about 39 pips. Did this overshoot invalidate the setup?

Currently, price is moving back towards the TL, and has almost reached it. Do we ignore the original setup and draw a new TL based on the new lowest low?

Thanks,

BC

--- 帖子 #182 ---
yeah, i also follow this GJ opportunity, and now already broke the TL also hit stop loss 50 point.. not a good one.. am i right david?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
guys yes, sl hit for me. all is good only first loss for the month. i was not on computers screen while trade happened.

cant win them all

hehe. but like i said 1st loss for the month so i say not bad at all was bound to happen soon.

hope all made this week i am up some 50+on gy and 60+ or so on other pairs(well have to calculate as i dropped my lot size on non gy pairs)

have a great weekend all. start of next week should have the neural up + skype chat.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
David thanks for this system. I've been reading and watching it here while testing it. Most of my questions have been asked by others so far. I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate you sharing it and also thanks to everyone else for sharing their trading and charts. It's all so very informative.

It's very good to see others who are willing to share a good system without wanting to sell it.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
i agree with you tnfxtrader.  i have never seen such success in forex, lol i fall in the classic 95% of retail losers..   since i have been reading this thread  there's been a complete reversal with my account.  i think 80-90% accuracy is damn good and thats what i have seen.

So thank you David and D lib and all those who shared their charts.  Look forward to trading this week.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hey there David,

I just looked at your thread for the first time and noticed your neural net effort.  I'm experimenting with NN myself so I'll subscribe and have a look when you post it.  BTW I'm a C++ programmer myself for my day j.o.b.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yes, i also agree.. really thank you especially for david who starts the thread to share also d lib who give a lot contribute..

Thanks for your doc, D'liberators! It's very helpful!  :-)

I thought I had an ABCD indy on my pc before, but I can't locate it.  I did find this indy for trendlines.  I hope it helps!  For those experienced TL users/drawers, please let me know if this will suffice for drawing TL's.

by the time you allow for costs this is less than 1:1, could you explain what you are basing this on please.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
its the most accurate tp and sl for this pair. you can factor in the spread if you like to make it 1:1 i just like a round number

--- 帖子 #195 ---
this trade is off the 3rd bounce. a short sell. for this pair i would use a 20-30pip tp and sl. as you can see you would of won this trade

I'm glad with this thread. may I join here to discuss together? my style trading is use trendline and price action with 4hr timeframe.

now, if we see GBP/USD and EUR/USD, I guess they are possitive bullish..

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi guys!

Very nice trade you all have in here.

I am very interested in this thread because all you guys give the TLs the same importance to the manual trading as me. This is one of the few trades I can sayI have read completely (as it is the first one I arrived few days from its beginning hehe).  Neverthless, I got one doubt: how do you decide when to enter? I ask this because I am feeling confused regarding that, as sometimes by analyzing the charts posted, I see there is no need to wait any bullish-bearish candlestick to take the trade once price gets to the TL, but other times some traders wait for them.

In the first post, I can read that with the touch it is enough to take the trade. Thus, is this the rule the beginners with this strategy shall follow?

Btw, are there any plans of opening a trading room? If there are any problems, I believe that skype should be enough for now, opening a new conversation and start inviting lots of people

Thanks a lot!

Jed

If you missed this....no probs. just wait for the conservative approach

You can also use the conservative approach on 1hr time frame for an early entry on this.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
yeahh.. finally i draw a right line the same as d lib draw....

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi guys, What do you think for this trade ? If this candle close bearish entry sell ?

http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/417/entry1.gif

--- 帖子 #214 ---
nice setup. but still wait until candle close. if it become bull candle when candle close, I guess its not safe to entry sell..

--- 帖子 #215 ---
guys i dont trade signals which are formed by candles formed at the end of a week going onto a start of the week like the one above, however the bullish trend i will consider trading

--- 帖子 #216 ---
ok thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Do you like this trade ? go long if this candle close bullish .

--- 帖子 #218 ---
You're the Pro....me, am still learning..lol

on EU, there was a trade..signal on 4hr, but used the conservative entry style on 1 hr which also gave sweet pips...However, i'll still look for long opportunities as price approach the outer TL.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
yes this looks liek a good trade. if you took it well done.

I posted somewhere in this thread how i trade the conservative approach..how i set my stop loss..etc..

I think you'll need to go thru it again....AUDUSD [2nd trade] is still in trade for me..though not green yet..

I also used the 1hr entry approach i posted lately and that closed my first trade at 50+.....

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Thankyou very much, i´m going to read again all the post for to found that you say.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This is my first post here, I have been observing and taking a few trades. Excellent work being done here, I love it.

ACAD good confluence at a pivot zone and a 50 Fib retracement.

I do believe David trades are taken as touch of trendline ?(I stand corrected if I am wrong.)

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Missed taking this trade with my new found entry style which should bring me close to Dave's..

Should have zoomed on 4hr tf and use my conservative method..actually there was a signal on the 4hr..oooooo what a miss!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
guys what a crazy day! 2 of my gy trades were triggered by my neural net(on seperate dedicated server) netting me 100+pips..

i have been moving and havnt had access to propper charts so sorry for the lack of posts.

sum it up the first one broke the trendline by about 30 pips then completely reversed.this was a long trade..

the second one hit 133.18 then shorted for >50 pips almost to the pip.

i hope to post charts soon, well done to those who made.

p.s there is some confusion with entries.  I enter as soon as the price hits the trend.  Others enter when there is a confirmation candle.  Both ways are good, the second is more conservative.  The second entry method was dev'd by D liberators.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
hey dave i can see the trades you are talking about.. wish i sore them

so whens the neural net of urs going to be released??

Possible EU long setup. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
There's been a third bounce on this gradient. so trade with caution...

I'll prefer to wait for a bounce on the next TL as shown in the chart

--- 帖子 #247 ---
guys here are the charts for the 2 trades taken mentioned above.

the bull trend is marked by the pink underlines and the bear trend by the yellow.

with the yellow you can see the 3rd mark hit and broken through. this is because its on a 4hr timeframe. if you drop bak to the 15min or so you can see that it broke the

133.18 mark by a couple of pips then shorted for more than 50 pips(i only took 50)

the bull trend marked by the blue lines shows on the 3rd bounce it broke the trend and continued in a negative direction for 30 or so pips before completely reversing.  Both trades successful.  i know the eur/jpy trade some people were looking at would of been good to. hope all got in on these two, once again apologies for not posting charts as i have been moving.

I´ve a question : To draw thwe TL is necessary to take always the A-C points or i can to take C-A points ?

hi david, i have a question on the trendlines. we need to connect the low / high of the waves ? if i get a high then i need to wait for a low and reverse and get another high. if we connect the highs of such waves then we will get a good trendline.  just connecting highs of consiquetive bars (or alternate bars) is not proper. in my EJ chart i dont see any wave. that looks a bad trade

thanks again for pointing this out

--- 帖子 #266 ---
what i meant by your charts are off is that your candles are alot different to mine and therfor get different/incorrect trends.  that e/j trade you took on my chart the two legs were one 5 pips in value difference from each other.  That is a support resistance line, a completely different tradeable method.  your trendline drawing looks pretty good though its just that your charts are off.

guys good news.. will be releasing neural net upon first trade  i see on gy.

it has room for only 3 pairs as the only pair i trade live is gy(others are added for those that wish to trade other pairs)

the second is eurjpy any ideas for the third pair guys, was thinking maybe usd/chf or audcad. let me know here on the forum.

thanks

--- 帖子 #278 ---
is the pair hardcoded or configurable ?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
configurable.  but standard is gbp/jpy i wont be substituting this pair.  the other 2 spots can be another two pairs(for both short and long trades)

Hey David,

If you see at the bottom of the tread you could see me as online reading this thread...

I am trading the same method only for daily timeframe as I work full time

Many thanks for your good work

Ace

--- 帖子 #281 ---
ace i can see you! thanks im glad i could assist.  hows it going for you on the daily timeframe, are you trading non gbp/jpy pairs?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
how about audjpy or chfjpy

I have a question do u plan to have this neural code only for defined set of pairs or we can use them for any pair we like?

just curious

--- 帖子 #283 ---
its going good but the concept really works. where I am having problem is how to do the money management on daily time framce...I know u do 50:50 for 4hrs...Any suggestions?

I have charts opened for around 12 pairs..

--- 帖子 #284 ---
only for a set pair. though the pairs can be changed on the fly if needed

for now i have gy as the standard and i have two more spots. if need be i could upgrade this. this incorporates both short and long trades for each pair added.

i can change to 6 pairs, has the ability for this. but this is just for now..

as for your question on the daily timeframe, not sure, when i trade it(not very often) i use 50 50. this working for you?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Sounds great David...

The 50/50 works but sometimes I notice that i close the trade too early or didnt give it enough room to breath & for the price to turn around and go in the needed direction..so thinking of making it 100/100 as its a daily timeframe

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Ok here goes, don't know if my post is going to show up this time. But I posted two already in this thread and it doesnt show up.

Anyhows I have been following this thread for some time and it is a very intresting method. I am testing it on demo now to see if I can make it work for me.

Thanks Dave for all your hard work.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
no worries mate! hope all works out well for you.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
can anyone predict gj...my trendline have breakout....should i sell....

sorry my english not very good

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I, too, have been following this thread and am studying how the GY pair acts on a daily basis.  Will be shifting to the 4 hour TF now and study it for a while.  Great thread.  Thanks very much.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hello david, I think all 3 be jpy is not good but not sure for no. 3. May be eu? Thx.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Do you guys think it is good to short on eur/usd ?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
this is a short signal though i cannot comment how successful this method is on this pair as i have never traded it. i cant give sl or tp's either.

my 50 sl and tp is for liquid pairs like gy.

this surge up is caused by very positive retail sales coming out of gbp.

best to stay out of market around high impact news. i say not to enter 1hr before adn depending if the news deviated heavily from the forcast 1hr after aswell

--- 帖子 #293 ---
guys here is a screenshot of the latest neural that  i will upload as soon as i see some trades.

the format of line 1 is:

Trendline1 buy gbp/jpy 1 price leg1: leg2: price | Trendline2 leg1: price leg2: price tp&sl

second line:

just has the one direction so if its a buy only buy details on that line.

with the first option can squeeze more pairs into the app

what do you all think?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
David that looks very good man, I thin we can squeeze in more pairs let's not limit our selfs

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Looks pretty good....would like to try it soon

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Can this be uploaded on MT4 platform?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
no its mfc based.  but it will work for any platform. its hard to explain how it works ill just upload a camtasia screen record of how it works to youtube or something. probably later on during the day or tomorrow

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi all,

my first post in this thread.

Nice work and ideas sharing done by everybody, especially thanks to David to have introduced the strategy.

My suggestion to the money management is to identify previous swing high/low level or previous support/resistance area and fix TP at those levels.

If possible start the operation with 2 lots: close the first lot at first TP and move the stop loss of the second lot to BE and wait for the second TP (or use appropriate TS).

--- 帖子 #299 ---
yes this might be good for those who are trading non gy pairs. the 50/50 tp and sl has been working like a charm for me.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
guys you can add me on skype ill be on periodically during the day

skype name david48644

still no trades on the gy so will keep all posted

--- 帖子 #301 ---
David, I'm not sure I understand the first option of your neural net.  Could you please explain a little more?  TIA!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
its just the format, i think im confusing everyone so ill upload a screenvideo on how it works.

second of all everyone i would like to apologise. i was out and didnt even setup my broker for the gy trade earlier on. my nn generated a perfect short sell.  This wont happen again.  a screenshot of the missed trade is attached

as for this trade i almost got stopped out, glad i warned everyone to stay on the sidelines.  news can be a b*tch sometimes  .

guys im calling it a week after this one. to sum it up 100pips if this one loses if wins +150 for me hope all made aswell.

ill be uploading everything(screencast of nn +nnn client)

have a great weekend all!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Dave,

Thanks for your great strategy.  I was trading a very similar way and it's great to find people who are on the same page as me!  People tend to overload their charts with indicators and this is pretty much as simple as it gets, yet is highly effective.  I'm glad to be in the 5% that win!  Looking forward to your NN client.  I'm done for the week +214 pips -  have a good weekend!

Hello David,

EJ, gu, and now GY and abt 3 others that are posted here...mainly EU, UCAD, AJ thanks to u.....I won on the GY trade because I waited for it to pierce the TL  and go to a Fib and resis.....but this strategy has change my win ratio big time....

How did u come up with this strategy?

guys nn is finally up

Once connected it will auto update itself with upcoming trades

aplogies for the poor quality of the screen video i dont have time to learn camtasia.

i have also attached the text file for what was said in the video.

please read the readme file that comes with the zip

Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #322 ---
thanks david i am trying it right now..to install

--- 帖子 #323 ---
ok i have it up and running

--- 帖子 #324 ---
dave, thanks for the video. can you explain what is nnclient and how this works ? i have oanda account. does it work with metatrader platform ?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
hey roundrock, it works on all platforms with 1-click execution orders.

how it works is it connects to my main nnhost which lists the trades. the trades will be visible through the nnclient and you can choose to autoexecute them if you wish.  The way it autoexecutes is via mouse clicks and remembering where the buy and sell buttons are on your one click order window. so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that trade and auto trade it(when it hits the line on the 3rd bounce) if they choose. if you dont want to autotrade it you can just use it to view which trades i will be taking.

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Dave great work!  Looking forward to using it for the upcoming trading week!  Thanks for all the time and hard work you put into this!

Greg

--- 帖子 #327 ---
your welcome greg!

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hello david, thanks to you for this.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hey dave, I'm unclear how the program finds trades.  Does it somehow look on the chart for trendlines?  Right now the program connects and displays "no pending trades, window will autoupdate".  I tried drawing trendlines but it doesn't matter.

Also, in the readme.txt file you talk about "trade layouts".  Where are these actually specified?  Are they stored in a file?  Attached to drawn trendlines?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
hello stevegee58, i had same q but then re-read davids post where he say "how it works is it connects to my main nnhost which lists the trades." and "so when my nnhost(which analyzses market for these trend patterns) lists a trade everyone who is connected can see that trade"
so i think we are connect to david nn and when it find trade it tell us

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Actually if the basic system is trading trendline bounces with a fixed SL/TP then autotrading is fairly straightforward.  There are several trendline EAs out there that work pretty well.  You just draw the trendline and name it a certain way so the EA can find it.  Then when price gets near the trendline the EA enters according to the strategy you select (i.e. limit order at trendline, or bounce of so many pips after touching the trendline.)

I don't quite see what a NN gets you.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I dont have to stare at charts, draw trendlines and screw around with an EA.  Thats the advantage.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks a lot david!!!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I understand the sentiment, but drawing trendlines on an H4 chart and running an EA to catch the trend continuations might require 4 hours/week at the most.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi , I am new to your tread . can you summarise the trading methodlogy so I can follow ? example :-

1 ) ideal timeframe

2 ) entry level

3 ) exit level

4 ) SL level ( hard SL ? )

5 ) TP level ?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #336 ---
What exactly is the point you are trying to make...discredit the NN?

You are advocating the use of an EA..the thread owner is givng what he has been using sucessfuly..are both not automated trading in a way? so i wonder what the fuss is all about...

Let's be constructive and add value to things rather than draw up unnecessary argument..if you have a point to make, pls make it without drawing a bad air of someone else...NN has not even been tested yet and its already been attacked....perhaps you are one of the ''big boys''..lol

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Far from it.  I have yet to see a NN that actually works consistently for trading, that's all.   I'm looking forward to hearing how the NN actually works.  I'm just leery of black box implementations, that's all.

The OP's original system is good, however.  My suggestion of trading it with EA isn't far-fetched.  It's not fully automatic since you have to keep drawing trendlines.  So it's up to you what trends you see.  The EA would just initiate trades and manage them based on your hand-drawn trendline.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
What a good idea for sharing, thanks. I am not keen on autotrades but very grateful for connectivity in real-time.

A BIG thank you.

Do we trade with the trend ?

& if nobody help to answer my qestions , I am looking elsewhere .

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Dude, it's all on page 1...

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Read the thread. Your questions have been answered many, many times.

If you are interested in this strategy, read the thread, if not, leave.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
ok guys first of all here's how my nnhost works. it scans my datafeed provided by reuters api and bloomberg api.  It then draws these trendline and plots trades accordingly.  when the price hits the level of the third bounce it will generate a sell signal or buy signal.  Now i cant be running the nnhost on every machine or from my laptop because i will have to install bloomberg and reuters and quite frankly it will congest my hardware and make everything a hassel.

my solution was the nnclient(nothing like the one i have released for ff).

The nnclient you see now is basically the same as i had for myself but is tweaked for ff(and made the gui a whole lot nicer).

I have been using this method for 5 years but have been using my nn for around 3.  I have been successful this entire time.

steevegee58, this isnt just a blackbox system. I do understand where you are coming from.  My method is clearly outlined in this thread and thats how my host plots its lines(not based on some random magic algorithm).  sure there is an ea to do do something similar but the ea's enter blindly. my host takes news into account(when i have it flagged to do so). Not just that, i dont use mt4 for my broker, how would i enter such trades on a non mt4 account?  This is unversal for all brokers with 1click execution.

I would suggest testing on a demo account firstly.

The client has room for 6pairs so my next pair in line is most likely ej.  i only trade gy so if anyone has any suggestions that would be good.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi David

I would suggest also GBP/USD and maybe USD/JPY. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
thanks for that fguru, have you traded these with any success? tp and sl will also have to be adjusted so i will watch over them or if anyone else has been trading these 2 pairs what sl and tp's ahve you been using? the 50pip sl and tp i use for the gy is only good for fast moving fx pairs..

appreciate the feedback

--- 帖子 #346 ---
ok david, got it. thanks for the explanation. its something like it records your button execution, writes its scripts and remembers it and then next time does it automatically. but how about the quantity ? does it take same qty everytime ? also the symbol has to be in same exact location in the window, if it is changed then it will place order for a different pair ? how does it remeber the pair  since we have more than 1 pair.

i wrote something like this AUTOIT, for my broker for stocks. it works great !!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks for your explanation, it was quite interesting.  So the reuters and bloomberg datafeeds are for knowing when news events are coming to avoid entry?

I'm learning about NNs now and experimenting with them.  What are the inputs to the NN and how many neurons and layers are there?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hey roundrock, i have used software which works similar to this 2. basically it records the exact location on the screen for where the buy and sell buttons are. if you move the order window it will just click whatever is behind the order window -probably just empty space or a chart.  Going from the readme file you will have to set up the buy/sell everytime you open the program or every time the checkbox is unticked.

as for stop loss, take profit and lot size this is determined by you.  You may want to open a oco order where you can specify the sl and tp as for the order size this is defined by you.

I have cell message notification on my broker so when i get the message i will log in via my iphone and will set my tp and sl if im out..

pretty darn good setup dave, this must of took you a while.. appreciate all you have done for us  im already more successful than i ever was because of your method.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I agree - Thanks Dave!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
no probs guys.

just a quick update, no trades generated for the gy yet(for those watching the charts and not connected to nn)

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks David can't wait to make some pips this week

--- 帖子 #352 ---
im excited aswell!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Gee!..... I hate to be a pain in the you know where.....however I am not sure if I followed the correct steps. I have the fxdavenn window open, it currently says No Pending trades. Window will auto update. ( I have the box at the beginning of the sentence checked)......I hope that's it.

Just wondering if someone could confirm that with me.

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #354 ---
ezzy, all that is is just a notice to say there are no trades yet generated. as soon as a trade is generated that line will be replaced with for example

"BUY GY TL1 L1: 135.35 L2:135.55 50/50"(only an example)

if you have the checkbox ticked make sure you setup the co-ordinates of the buy/sell buttons correctly. watch the vid if not sure.

david48644

hope this helps

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Helps a lot, many thanks!!! I just unchecked the box.....so I guess that I will see is a notice as you mentioned above.

Thanks mate

The g/y is looking like it is setting up for a long trade nicely guys, what do you think ?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
could, just waiting on a couple more candles

--- 帖子 #358 ---
guys also just one more thing patience is the key to success. dont just trade for the sake of trading.  its the start of the week plenty of time for setups. as soon as a trade is generated it will be posted on the nn and i will also post here on the forums. just had a few emails asking when i will be making the next trade..

--- 帖子 #359 ---

Hello david, did GY trigger and give nice pips with last candle?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
No prob, sounds like a plan!!

--- 帖子 #365 ---
There was a nice short on the USDCHF.  I tried a trailing stop, but it took me out too early for my liking as i left a lot of pips on the table.

http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/6996/overview.gif

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I've found trailing hurts the performance of the various systems I've traded.  It feels good psychologically because you seem to be reducing risk.  In reality you're increasing the chances of an early stop-out and not letting the trade run.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
steeve agreed. trailing stops lead to early stop out imo..

--- 帖子 #368 ---
guys finally i have a trade for you on the gy

nn is autoupdated

and a screenshot is attached. its a short for the gy

so it reads TL1: sell gy L1:135.55 L2:135.38 50/50

this reads as trendline1 sell gbp/jpy leg1 value 135.55 leg2 value 135.38 50 stop 50 tp

--- 帖子 #369 ---
yes i can see the signal in my nnclient

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Me too

--- 帖子 #371 ---
please advise the entry price ?

--- 帖子 #372 ---
the enry price is a sell when it hits the trendlines as shown in the pic dave posted above

--- 帖子 #373 ---
k. thanks.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
guys eur opens in 1hr remember to have your buy/sell setup if autotrading.

remember this only gets you in the trade you will have to organize lot sizes and sl/tp's your self

--- 帖子 #393 ---
in at 135.37 , better price

--- 帖子 #394 ---
yes better price ibz..

news indicator for consumer sentiment came out way better than expected for the gbp....... forcast was 2 and the actul was 33.. this could impact our trade i take it.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
hello Ezzy, i think that price is leg 1.

If i am right leg 1 = 1st touch, leg 2 = 2nd touch and leg 3 = 3rd touch =entry. May be i am not right.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
yes i just got an alert on my phone so i jumped on my pc.. the forcast for the news was 2 the actual was like 33 or something. very bad for the trade. this indicator never impacts the market so hmm...

This is a good reason to stay out of market if there is news, even orange news can stuff up a good trade.

if it breaks the support of 77 i would say exit all

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Whose SL hit ? Hope mine won't reach .

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Dift

What it says is ;  Leg 1 135.55, Leg 2 135.38.......not sure the difference between the two

--- 帖子 #399 ---
ezzy driftwood is right

--- 帖子 #400 ---
.......I thought entry was at Leg 1.... why don't I have a Leg 3??

Looking at my chart.......what you say driftwood does make sense.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I'm still in . looks like its comming down .

--- 帖子 #402 ---
its impossible to avoid news on 4 hr charts .

--- 帖子 #403 ---
The daily chart shows that the ressistance very strong . looks like coming down is the only direction . Institutional players are shorting .

--- 帖子 #404 ---
That's not really true, unless you're only opening trades on the bar open.

There's generally a bar forming during a news event.  You wait for any trendline traversal during news to resolve itself before entry while the bar is forming.

Also, you draw the trendline on the H4 chart but you could still look for entry on a lower timeframe as long as it involves the H4 trendline.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Remember that a trendline can be broken

Price was above the Daily Pivot (M15 chart)

Trend was bullish

1.Price bounced at the D_Pivot 134.8350 and Ema(21)

2.Price went up and bounced at the upper trendline, reversal

3.Price retraced and bounced at the Ema(21), bullish reversal pattern

4.Trendline was broken and price going up, up, up...

Stoploss of 50 pips is reached...

My condolences to everyone who had a loss on his live account.

eTrader,

--- 帖子 #406 ---
yes trendlines can be broken. news is usually a mitigating factor in this, well trading my method any way.

i got stopped these things happen. i wont overlook any orange news again. all red + orange will be included in my trade freezing for +1 hour after(if the deviation was grat) and -hour the anticipation of the news

plenty more trades to be had

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Thats what you all get for leaving me behind..if i were on the train, would av stopped it and turn it around in our favour.....lol

Anyway, Dave never said this was an holy grail..so we live to fight another day..

--- 帖子 #408 ---
The forecast was 2 the actual was 33 - however there is a little star on the detail button on the ff news page.  It states "Source changed series calculation formula as of this release;" I'm assuming thats the reason for the large difference between forecast and actual.

going to add the other pairs, so in the nn you will see alot more, not just the 1 line for the gy.

heres how it will be ordered.

gy  50/50

ey  40/40

gc  40/40

uc  30/30

au  30/30

aj   30/30

what do you guys think? they will be manually added. ill activate autoexecution on them next week.

--- 帖子 #414 ---

is there a second trade?

that trade yesterday would of been good imo. i was +27pips. news stuffed it up. i agree dave, i think all news should be taken into account not just news marked as red on ff.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
guys you will see an updated window for the nn as displayed in the attached screenshot.

its for the au, autotrading isnt enabled for this pair as of yet, will probably add next week

Hi David

Just wanted to ask you or anyone else that may know the answer, I still have yesterday's sell gy information on my nn, how can I gt rid of it.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
hello david, not here now  thx

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi David,

I saw u in the thread now and I just added you from skype. Perhaps you will add me in when u on skype. Thanks

Sam

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Dotmag, still the same problem?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
pretty sure i added you, send me a msg i got a fair few ppl on there

All fixed .......just changed by itself.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
guys a usd/cad trade has come up see screenshot. nn has been autoupdated

--- 帖子 #431 ---
aud/usd  looks bullish and trending up .I bought at 89.42

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi David,

I restarted the Metatrader platform and then your NN client: the first picture immediately and the second one after 5 min.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
remember not to trade around news time

--- 帖子 #434 ---
yes the second one is the most up to date window. i posted the updated trade above

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Ok! thanks.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
im out of the cad trade. nice one dave!

in @ 1.0309 out at 1.0330.

i like how there's multiple pairs in this nnclient, im finally getting a feel for it.

how long till you auto trade this, i know this feature will be good for ppl like me who get bored waiting and get in other trades which arent so good... heheh

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi guys First post on here, I have been trading trendlines with additional support, so I like the idea here. Question for dave 486 did'nt you say in one of the posts that for a 3rd bounce of a trendline inorder to take the trade you should wait for a few 4H candles before taking the trade for the 3rd bounce is this correct? as the current trade on USD/CAD the 3rd bounce was right after the the 2nd bounce ie the very next candle. I appologise if I have misinterpreted this.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
hey kdx welcome. no if i did type that it was a mistake could you show me the post.

what i would of meant is there should be a couple of 4hr candles between the first 2 legs, after the 2nd leg if the price touches the trendline drawn from the first two legs this is considered to be the 3rd touch/entry

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Thanks for that David, I'm with you totally yes I misunderstood the gap as you mentioned ie the candles needs to be between the first two candles, I read most of the thread over the weekend so should have checked again before posting. The neurl client is excellent by the way. Lastly if you are still using the skype room could you kindly add me my id is : kdx205

Thanks

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi Dave,

What is [TL5: Sell au L1:90.68 L2:90.24 30/30]?

Sorry if my question repeated.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Again sorry.... I think its AU which is not been ready yet?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
no problem sam.

l1 is the leg 1 price l2 is the leg2 price. so you draw a trendline from these two prices starting from the leg1 price and you will get the trend. so sell when it hits the trendline formed by leg1 and leg2 stop loss 30 tp 30

--- 帖子 #443 ---
guys is anyone using windows vista with my nnclient? i have one trader who cant get the trades to display and was thinking maybe its a firewall issue or a uac issue. any help would be good

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I'm running Vista and the client works fine.  It displays trades right away.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hello david, sorry no help Vista.

The cad is trigger i think but is stayed on nn?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
hey drift i message him on skype about this before. he leaves it on the nn fora  while.

anyone else take this one?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
hello john, yes i see it now say sucessful   i am follow by eye only for this trades no live trade them yet.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Thanks David.

Is it valid sell entry for UJ?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi Dave,

I have been watching your thread for a few days now and monitoring the setups manually - great little system you have got going here - nice work and thanks for sharing!!

Cheers Brent

--- 帖子 #450 ---
guys messaged dave as 2 y my nn wasnt connecting here is his response incase you were wondering.

"john, a technician cut a fibre optics cable that provides net access to my server. so its down, they are working on repairing it and they havnt given an eta so like everone else im disconnected aswell. so much for their guaranteed redundancy that my provider stated.. ill post on the thread as soon as im back up"

so i guess we'll just have 2 wait for his post until the nn is back up..

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Thanks John - I have only just downloaded and installed it today - I thought I was doing something wrong!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
guys finally back online, the nn is up again. i entered the aud trade and close for 10pips. closed because my host was down.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
usd/chf trade see screnshot

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi David,

could you please tell me at what price and time did you entered the trade because mine was not triggered.

Do you have right now a set up to sell usdchf?

Thanks,

Dotmag

--- 帖子 #455 ---
yes David: you have the setup for usdchf....

--- 帖子 #456 ---
dotmag it was entered manually meaning everyone connected wasnt executed, only testing out these pairs for the week then ill add auto execute

i got in at 8962 and out 8953 so 9 pips or something.

yes waiting for the usd/chf

remember you wont be autoexecuted this week on these pairs i will be adding this feature probably next week

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Thanks for your reply, now I remember your warning on the autoexecution of new pairs.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi Dave, you dont have Gbp/Usd on your NN there have been some great bounces of current trendlines recently just a thought.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Still in the trade with +60 pips . Another 100+ pips more to go .

--- 帖子 #460 ---
For U/J (GMT8:00 29/Jul):

H4 TL3 touched should trade buy

D1 TL3 touched should trade sell

Please any one who can help me on this? Should go for buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
these trades look like they both have triggered and succeeded

usd/jpy 4hr 3 touch arleady happened and the daily 3touch for the short already happened

--- 帖子 #462 ---
im removing the aud trade from the nn, i personally traded this and made 9 pips though the fibre connection to my server wehre my nnhost is was cut and got disconnected for a fair few hours.. i took the break in the asian session just testing how the aud performs during its native session. by the time it got to the eur session which is the recommended timeframe for trading this method it would of broken and would of made this trend invalid.

ill check the markets now for anymore trades accross the pairs

--- 帖子 #463 ---
new gy short sell. i havnt got auto execute enabled for this if you want me to enable it let me know and i will. please also take into account the news.

also only take the short if the next candle or greater, not the current candle hits the line which will make a 3rd bounce.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Thank you for sharing your idea Mr. David.

I need your explanation on the below set up.

TL1: sell gbp/jpy L1: 137.52 L2: 136.86 50/50

8:00am 29/JUL/2010 that is when that set u show, and immediately the price hit the TL that setup show. So what is the interpretation of that? and when exactly do i enter the trade? is it immediately the alert show or when that present candle finished? Please more explanation on this.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
lL1 = leg1 value L2 = leg2 value so you draw a line from leg1 to leg2 when price hits the trend again you sell. the autotrade feature i have disabled for the week because im testing other pairs.

see the screenshot above i posted

--- 帖子 #466 ---
eur/jpy shortsell see screenshot watch out for any us news

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Do you mean trade excute on next open candle which after 3rd bounce's (I call it L3) candle? This is from my understanding from this thread.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
What of if i want to enter the trade manually my self? when is the suitable time to enter? is it at the touch of the line? or when the bar that touched the line closed? Pls I will be looking forward to see your quick response.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
yeh thats waht he means. so next oen candle if it hits the trend made from l1 and l2 you buy

--- 帖子 #470 ---
hello all,good frend i find for lines. add in chart. draw trendline. at line properties description say Alert_(say the many pips u like) like may be Alert_15. when price get 15pips from line box pops up to say u. must be used big A not a.

can do email to but i am confused to do that

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hi David

Discovered your system yesterday and decided to try it out. I'm 130 pips in profit as at 16:00 BST today, so to say that I am impressed is an understatement.

I've been learning about trading for almost two years and have tried many systems, and I do mean 'many' Up until now I have focussed on short time frames (5 min to 15mins) thinking that they would suit my style and be more applicable to my future as a day trader. However, I am now begining to realise that longer time frames actually work bett and are more reliable.

So I would like to thank you for posting this system and may the pips be with you...

--- 帖子 #472 ---
hello david, another win for the method

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Question 1:

Should "yes" appeared on [Successfull] column once E/J is valid to trade? Or what is the condition for "yes" to appear?

Question 2:

USD/CAD

L1.0254 L2:1.0298 as shown on post #466 is indicated for Line 1 (drawn according to NN).

However, Line 2 should consider valid buy entry? If yes should NN update it? I did restart my MT4 + NN but remain for U/CAD.

Do I miss any?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
ok so going by the rule this would be a trade on my broker and would have been profitable trade to if i am correct on this cause by my count there is 4 hits on the trend line already
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #475 ---
hello Tazca, i think no.2 is not count. May be u read post 438 for more better idea.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
hello sam2vt, i think may be yes come when trade is successful. Question 2 i leaf for david

--- 帖子 #477 ---
So then it was still a trade then cause 4 would have actually been 3 then and entry on 4 would have yeilded about 70 pips

--- 帖子 #478 ---
so looking at the neural and ploting on my chart

gbp/jpy +50

eur/jpy +40

usd/cad +30

those all would have been hit today according to my charts nice results for a day of trading if i had of come accorss this thread befor just found it about a hr ago and it seems to be very simple to follow

--- 帖子 #479 ---
hello Tazca, GY = no valid 3 touch yet for me. uc = 30 hours ago see post 436. ej = today.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
correct me if i am wrong them by my chart this last 4hr bar was a buy on USDCAD

my GBPJPY Has 3 hits

and not sure if i marked up AUDUSD right

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and current usdcad on mine could also be a sell maybe

--- 帖子 #481 ---
hello Tazca, who is u broker charts plz?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Right Win Group Fx

--- 帖子 #483 ---
hello Tazca, david use fxdd so i change to use same there demo charts. 4hr charts ending is not same with all brokers that may be is why not same as mine or david nn.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
true enough not all the charts are the same.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
guys great night last ngiht. the eur made a nice 40 pips.

under the successful bar there if it reads yes or no that means the trade has already been taken. sorry for the confusion.

so what do you all think, from monday auto execution on non gy pairs?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
tazca the cad is from i think wednesday, the gy has only formed the first two legs(the second hit is invalid because its too close to the first) still waiting on the gy and usd/chf

--- 帖子 #487 ---
then by looking at the charts USDCAD from wensday was invalid as 2 and 3rd are hit one candle after the other just like the GBPJPY chart i posted. so why is one valid and other not

--- 帖子 #488 ---
no the usd/cad trade was valid. the first and second legs had more than 1 candle between them the gy 1 candle hit then the one after hit on the next candle which makes the second candle invalid. the 3rd hit you see on the charts is counted as the second hit.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi David. I need your help on the question below

USD/CAD

L1:1.0254 L2:1.0298 as shown on post #466 is indicated for Line 1 (drawn according to NN).

However, Line 2 should consider valid buy entry? If yes should NN update it? I did restart my MT4 + NN but NN stay remain for U/CAD since 28/Jul. My problem could be same as Ezzy (post #421)?

Do I miss any?

Sam

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Thanks driftwood.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
i think you have mis interpreted dave's earlier posts which describe the format of the lines. leg1: price leg2: price

you draw the line from leg1 price to leg2 price.  not a seperate line for each leg.  the line which you have labelled as line2 is the product of leg1 and leg2. as you can see the bounce of the 3rd hit on the line created a buy signal which was profitable. i traded this line according to the nn and daves rules and made pips.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
This is how it looks on my MT4 (forex.com).

All three trades would have been very successful.

USD/CHF did not trigger.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
spot on fguru with the others though with the eur/jpy the one marked as 3 should be 2 and the bar directly after should be 3! thats what my charts look like, did u take the eur/jpy that happened earlier?? nice trade bagged 40 of it!

dave plz enable autoexecution for all pairs next week

--- 帖子 #494 ---
You are absolutely right john19r. I made a mistake! I have attached the EUR/JPY chart again, now it should be correct.

No, unfortunately I did not take any of the trades, as I forgot to open the neural client in the morning.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Thanks John I have clearer picture now.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
but that gbb/jpy of fguru post exact same as mine and david said it was invaild on mine but you say it is vaild on fguru post and his usdcad is drawn same as mine also which was vaild on line one my second line on my cadusd could also be a trend too yes no ?

and eurjpy was also one  hit then  2 and 3 where one candle after another and it is vaild trade is this cause they where both down candles?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
tazca, your gbp/jpy chart is correct but there was no 3rd bounce. looks like a difference in the data feed between fxdd and your broker.

your chart is drawn correctly though and if you did take that trade it would of been profitable.  where the red arrow is pointing down this would classify as the 3rd bounce according to the screenshot in post #481

--- 帖子 #498 ---
ok that does clear it up for me now and yes diffrence in feeds and stuff and i see fguru had same chart setup and go 110 pips i think the chart said .. My feed is my own feed

--- 帖子 #499 ---
your own feed? from where if you dont mind me asking..

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hey guys, do we have two new setups here?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This would have been another valid trade, right?

Sorry for posting so many charts, but I understand the method better when I do this and maybe it helps other members too.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
It is from a canadian lquitiy provider.. Right Win Group FX is the MT4 feed.  You can trade the feed threw RWGFX meta trader

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I guess really what i am missing is how you determain where leg one is on the chart cause there is so many place where you could put leg one and have leg 2 already there and be waiting on leg3 to form.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I am looking for a clear trend, either up or down. For example when I see an uptrend I put my leg 1 on the lowest point of a bull candle. Then I count 5-7 candles and there I put my second leg. Then I wait for the next candle and most likely this will be leg 3 - the trigger leg.

I have studied the successful setups/trades we had so far and often the second leg was 5-7 candles after the first leg and the trigger leg (3) one candle after leg 2. Maybe just coincidence, I dont know.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
this trade looks valid, dave will probably add to the nn.

does anyone have a candle time indicator?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Here you go.

Hi david, I am in the trade already, but only demo. Thinking about entering live, or is it too late now?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
too late, the trade is gone.  if you miss a trade not to worry theres always another. the aud trade should be coming up soon

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I meant the AUD trade.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
suppose you could enter if you wish, i wont be entering until the line touches though!

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Just buy!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
After "Buy" for EJ realised the candle is yet close for 3rd bounce. According to the thread should only trade on next candle open after 3rd bounce candle close. Please correct me if am wrong. Am I plotting the chart correctly?

Still in demo not so headache.

Should ready for "buy" on GJ?

On my chart it touched at 0.8984 already.

Morning

I have a question relating to the nn as follows:

How long will the trade stay notified on the nn after the entry point is passed? for example, I just opened up the nn at about 07:30 BST and notice 3 trades. But I cant seem to get the TL points as indicated?

Am I doing something wrong?

GG

--- 帖子 #520 ---
morning, what charts are you using? im using fxdd and 4hr timeframe.

as for the aud trade all well done another winner! 30 pips for me, hope all took this one aswell

--- 帖子 #521 ---
yep nabbed 30+ for this one 2. BRILLIANT!!! awesome work dave. haha what away to start the weekend going to celebrate for sure

and good work fguru for spotting it 2

whens auto trading happening?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I'm using IBFX (MT4) on 4 hr timeframe.

Think I'm getting the hang of locating the TL points, but would still like to know how long the trades remain on the nn after the entry point has passed?

Thanks

GG

--- 帖子 #523 ---
ibfx is intorducting broker for mbtrading if im correct. their charts are from their own liquidity pool. use fxdd charts demo is free and its the same for live.

trade stays open and will display whether its been successful or not for a while

ill try and remove them asap to dispell confusion

--- 帖子 #524 ---
HI Mr. David......I want to know how to use FMC(TL) software to enter trade? secondly, when and how does the software generate signal? lastly, is it automatic to get new signal or i have to close and reopen all the time to receive fresh signal?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
i dont know what fmc tl software is. its automatic it will update itself. software generates signals when my host finds them or i manually enter them

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I mean the FOREX DAVE NEURAL CLIENT software that i download from this thread. presently, I'm seeing (eur/jpy no trade) and (usd/cad no trade), so when will i know when there will be trade on them? and will it be immediately your software detect the signal that is shows here?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
David

I've been using the nn.....forgot to say thanks. Only demoing at the moment, but really enjoying it.

Once again, many thanks.

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #528 ---
yes it means exactly what it says. when it updates it updates in real time. so under the successful tab if there is a yes or a no(you will see a yes for the aud) it means the trade has come and gone and was successful, the other two havnt triggered yet. just draw the trendlines on a chart and you will see if they have been triggered or not

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thank you very much....I hope i be like you soon in trading

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi, anyone take AUD/USD as shown from NN? Do mind sharing your chart and showing the entry point? As I might misunderstand where the entry point should be.

I did not take this trade as am confusing.

Thank you very much for your help.

Hi Sam

I believe the trade was taken where the arrow is.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Tazca,

For a down trend, the line connects the highs.  For an uptrend, the line connects the lows.

hello Ezzy, AU was a buy. Here my chart for Sam.

Please help.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
hey fxnub, i reset the server so there are no trades. i may put the usd/chf trade back up though. as for the toher pauirs will wait this week for some more trades to be generated.  have been trading 5 pairs so there will be some trades happening.  Did you watch the video on the setup?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Great thread guys. I'm a new member and have been reading thru the thread and trust to finish by Monday. Thx to all for sharing & hope I can contribute something positive here too.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Thanks for the good work.

I have one more question....Pls how do i auto trade your NN

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Scalping is a rather specific type of trading.  It is opening a position and holding it for anywhere from as little as seconds (which brokers hate and you shouldn't do) to as long as 5 or maybe even 10 minutes.

Most actual "scalping" involves a trade held for between 1 and 3 minutes.

Can someone explain to me exactly how it is that this system, with positions that can be held for several days, is in any way a "scalping" system?

Please don't take my question to mean I'm bashing on you or something ... because that isn't my intention at all.  I am simply trying to understand.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Vaid or not ? does sunday open bars count or is it to risky ?

if they count looks like may have a AUD USD setup

guys i think the PT said be the next closet trendline and use the trendline that u r trading off of as a TS,JUST MY 2 CENTS

--- 帖子 #550 ---
mr charlotte have you watched the video? the autotrade works of mouse clicks and the setup is explained in the video. it records on the screen where your buy and sell buttons are and when a sell or buy comes from the host it will click on the locations recorded. this means once setup you cannot move the order window.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
pt? could you please elaborate?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
several days? most i have held a position with this method is 3hrs, the rest tp's were all hit within the hour. maybe dave can elaborate on why he called the thread trendline scalping. I dont see the importance of the terminology used. i guess if it makes you fell better you could call it swing trading.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hey guys,

what do you think, do we have some opportunities here?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
hello

GJ and EJ no trades now..

is the server ok?

I just try this method now..

btw, if I see more than 2 pairs there, can I trade in all of that pairs, or should I choose only one of them?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
toi you can trade all pairs. theres 5(might add another soon)

ey and gy have autotrade enabled on them, the rest will be manual entries. As for now there are no trades accross the pairs hopefully soon there should be some.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi fguru...as per my understanding the 2nd leg should not be the current candle...the trendline should have touched 2 previous highs or 2 previous lows.

David please correct me if i am wrong

--- 帖子 #557 ---
guys for all those who are a bit confused here's an example of a gy trade which happened on friday and was listed in the nnclient.

on the 3rd touch it hit almost to the pip and retracted for a cool 50pips

--- 帖子 #558 ---
What do you mean by autotrade enabled on ey and gy? I don't have to set buy/sell (accross my pointer to buy and press b, to sell and press s)?

Sorry, still confused..

--- 帖子 #559 ---
ok when there is a ey and gy trade you check checkbox next to the trade in the nnclient, select autoclick then setup have your order windows setup for one click execution open then select the text box for the setup for the corresponding pairs and move the mouse over to the buy and sell buttons and press b for buy and s for sell. you do this each for both pairs. a 'set' wll appear when the locations are recorded. did you watch the video?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
guys also remember the nnclient updates in realtime so it will update in there first before on here.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
After setting up the auto click, can i continue with other things, or i just have to leave the mouse on touch

--- 帖子 #562 ---
ah, yes..I got it now..

thanks a lot..

so for each pair, I need to set it up..right?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
hello david, my fxdd demo be change to 5 decimel place  can u tell how i go back to 4 plz? thx

--- 帖子 #564 ---
once more..

is it only for 4 digits broker? or I can apply it in 5 digits broker too?

Thanks..

--- 帖子 #565 ---
yes for each pair you need to setup. so individual signals can be received from the server. for example a gbp/jpy buy order might happen 2hours before a eur/jpy buy or sell order

--- 帖子 #566 ---
you can continue with other things just aslong as the order windows are still in the same place and not covered by anything. you can just enable the alert and check the status of the nnclient if you need to minimize the windows and enter manually upon hearing the alert

hi

i dont get this system at all. it is very confusing. can you explain it in one go so that a layperson could understand ? along with some simple charts showing exit and entry etc ? many thanks

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hey dude if u that lazy then you wont make it in forex, read the whole thread and you will understand what this system is all about. You can't get it any easier than what David has made it for us.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
hey driftwood, your charts are different to mine. i havnt got this marked as a trade

hello david, i am fxdd demo chart

--- 帖子 #574 ---
did you change the chart layout?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
sorry, but i have read it 6 times in the last two weeks. still dont get it. too many questions arise.

a simple explanation with simple charts would be a great help.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
hello david, i am not change nothing since last week. today fxdd demo be change to 5 decimel by them. can i see youre chart plz?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hello Mr. David, my NNclient is showing like 5 pairs but their all showing no trade since morning, So i want to ask hope is not my own that is behaving like that? though it was showing connected but no one was saying anything among the 5 since it has been like that.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
thats because there are no current trades

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Okay I got it thanks.....But while not building EA on this system of yours so that one can set it on VPS and then leave it to run?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
yes you can set it on a vps and leave it to run, i have a vps and do this also

--- 帖子 #581 ---
This is one of the most basic concepts of forex trading.  It's simple trend line trading where you buy or sell on the 3rd bounce of the trend line.  If you find this confusing you're in trouble.

Hi David

I have been following this thread for about two weeks now and have had good results with the methord. However i haven't got how to use the nn, first the videos l don't know what's wrong with my system but l have no audio, its just vissual. Its just this video l have audio for any other video but l don't know why your video have no audio on my system.

Secondary do l have to run the nn whenever l open the charts? Can't it be linked to the charts such that when ever l open the charts the nn starts running automatically? could l be missing something? I will appreciate your assistance and thanks again for this great system.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi David,

Should USD/CHF had valid entry for sell today? If yes why NN is not showing any trade today?

Am using FXDD demo.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Is this a valid setup?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Start with this......learn how trend line is drawn...to do that here on this thread, go to the page where there's an attachment on how to draw trendlines..read it over and over again, but more importantly, practise over and over again.

you can post ur practise charts here, am sure guys will be willing to help put you thru.....

--- 帖子 #587 ---
that's good advise. proper TL is crucial for any technique.

another aud long trade for 30 pips touch of trend line buy ### removed due to early break

--- 帖子 #597 ---
looking for gy and ey setups, these 2 are the only 2 that can be autotraded, will add the other pairs for next weeks session

watch out for the news remember not to enter 1hour before or 1hour after(if the news varied from forcast)

only enter euro session aswell

--- 帖子 #598 ---
because the two trades broke before the euro i will remove them from the nn. they very well could turn around though i would like to be safe rather than sorry

usd/chf short sell tp sl 30 pips when hits the tl

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Guys, I missed a wonderful trade (USD/JPY) on DAILY chart because I was too anxious.

I entered the trade at the open of the current daily candle at 86.53 with SL 40 and TP 40. The trade went in the desired direction for 20 pips so I set the SL to +1 and went to bed (I thought better be save than sorry).

Just saw that it hit my SL (+1) while it went up to 86.60 just to go south again for 85 pips! If I wouldnt have moved my SL to +1 but rather to -10 I would have made a very great trade.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
@david and others,

maybe we have two new setups here. Please comment.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
fguru, yeh these look valid. swas going to add them to the nn.

ill do it now but wont enable autotrade until the euro start. good work.

on another note the usd/chf trade was triggered by news which made it invalid

--- 帖子 #603 ---
here is a screenshot for the two trades on the nn. These will be both autotradeable so have your nnclient setup to autotrade if you wish it to.

take a look at fguru's charts(2 posts back) for trendline layout

--- 帖子 #604 ---
hello david, is not L1 134.15?

and EJ L1 112.01? L2 113.08?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
correct abut l2 for ej. updated nn sorry about that one.

the rest are right, i started from the candle from the beginning of the week

ctrl-y will show you beginning candle(fxdd)

--- 帖子 #606 ---
hello david, thx for explain. I had same as fguru posts now GY is trigger. so we start new from Sun every week?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
I would like to ask the same question.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
hey fguru i had the same question for dave i asked him earlier this week. he said yes that he starts fresh from the new week because of the new pairs that hes added to quash confusion.  said it was easier to run from the begging of the week, results were the same.

so i suppose its up 2 u guys if you want to run it from the beginnign or from a previous week.

sorry forgot to add that on average usually trades are generated on a wednesday due to a new trend forming which he can apply his method to.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Yeah, I got a signal now for GJ n EJ..

I already set it up too..

btw, how about the lot size? should I set it up too or it's automatically set?

--- 帖子 #610 ---
toii the nn works of mouse clicks so when setup properly it only knows where the buy/ sell buttons are for the platform. things like lot size, sl and tp will have to be managed by ourselves. it only gets us in the trade.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
So all I have to do just set up for the buy n sell button?

after that, If the trades open, I have to set sl n tp for it?

I can put a pending order by looking to the nn, right?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
yeh exactly. oco orders you can specify a tp and a sl.  so with @market oco's it will get you in at market price when the nn clicks on the buy or sell then the sl and tp is predefined so if it hits the tp it will close and vise versa for the stop.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
ok, I think I will try to put a pending order by looking at neural client..

It will be easier for me sometimes..

btw, L1 is the first order, L2 is the second order, right?

thanks for your help..

--- 帖子 #621 ---
new usd/chf trade see chart, nn updated.

please note that all trades are not valid until eur session starts and  are invalid around news time. so beware of news.

this second leg has to close above the trend line in order to make it valid.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi David,

Should this for USD/CHF?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Yes I think he means USD/CHF.

SL hit at EUR/JPY

--- 帖子 #624 ---
its still asian session only trade euro to newyork

--- 帖子 #625 ---
you are totally right lol im having one of those days, barely slept.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Yes also the 3rd touch has already happened in fact a few hrs ago for usd/chf.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
not according to my chart

--- 帖子 #628 ---
ok 2nd touch was 1.0384 that 4hr candle closed  as a doji the nxt 4H candle pretty much opened on the TL but entry would have been around 1.0391. I'm using Alpari Uk.

I've also checked odl.Fxcm and 3rd touch there was around 1.0394.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
my chart is the same as dave's, hasnt touched. looks exactly like the screen he posted

--- 帖子 #630 ---
halifax pmi came out better than expected 30 mins ago wont be etnering on this trade if it hits the line in the next30 mins or so

--- 帖子 #631 ---
sorry, I still confused with L1 and L2..

should I put pending order in both signal??

thanks..

--- 帖子 #632 ---
NO!

L1 and L2 define the TL (trendline). You have to wait for the third touch: when the price touch the TL enter the trade in the direction suggested by the NN client with SL and TP.

Dotmag

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi guys

Great reading and inputs. Nice work David and very generous of you.

The reason for my post is a general enquiry about 2 points.

1) The concept mentioned by John (above) that the 3 hits have been recorded because the 2 middle candles have been on the trend line stikes me as a bit strange. Would you not normall wish for at least a candle gap between to validate the hit? The reason I say this is that it is possible for the No2 to be the close and the number 3 to be the open ergo it is really only one hit.

2) There appears to be differing charts even with the same timeframes ie several charts with 4h candles appear different. Similar in trend but slightly out when it comes to 'actual' candles open and close. So not hours out it would seem but out none the less. I can also state that my IG markets 4H differs from the ones quoted.

Has this been identified previously? It would make things rather difficult if we have 2 or 3 different charts for the same TF.

thanks for any feed back especially if I have this wrong somewhere

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I got TL1: sell gbp/jpy L1: 137.73 L2: 136.92 50/50

could you please give me an example for that?

thanks..

--- 帖子 #635 ---
If touch the TL sell with SL=50 and TP=50 the lot size is on your decision.

Hope it helps.

Dotmag

--- 帖子 #636 ---
dotmag is correct, thanks dotmag for the screenshot. guys have disabled auto execute for the gy. news coming out shortly. hopefully it doesnt ruin this trade entry(remember wont enter if news impacts market and breaks the tl)

will re-enable at +1hr after news or if news had no impact.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
How close to the TL does price have to get before you consider it valid? Are you looking for an actual touch of the TL? or (say) withing a few pips of it?.

I often seem to see price come close, and then shoot off in the direction suggested by the nn and think I should have taken the trade...

thanks

GG

--- 帖子 #638 ---
when it hit the L3, then we can open sell after that?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yes, but there are still some warnings to follow, you can find them in the David's first post, i.e. trade only after EUR session open, don't trade during news etc.

For example we are waiting right now for a GBP news so don't trade, it's gambling.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi GG,

we wait for a touch.

Dotmag

--- 帖子 #641 ---
ah, ok then..thanks..

--- 帖子 #642 ---
gg if you are feeling adventurous and say the price is 5-10 pips from the tl you could take the trade if you wanted to. but you risk entering early. i know what you are talking about with this current gy trade i sore the price hit 42 then retrace within 20mins by 40+ pips.. hehe would of been good if the price hit 50 which is where the tl is then retraced would of been a quick and easy trade. now i guess we just wait for the news to die out.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I took the trade at an earlier 'close pass'  and it's a few pips in profit for me now.

thanks for the answers

GG

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi David etal

May I ask why the European open is so important to trend trading and what news you consider important.

There was no important news to be released that I was aware of that would greatly affect the GBP?

Unless you meant the official reserve changes which is major news is it?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
the eur to new york sessions are the most liquid. i prefer this time frame

and as for news gbp had services pmi comine out 1hour and ten mins ago and a few hours before that halifax hpi came out. i now consider red to orange news to avoid.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
autotrade has been re-enabled for the gy everyone!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
thanks for the reply David

I have never previously questioned the accuracy of FX charts however this thread has given me cause. Especially as you wish to trade of specific trend lines and price points.

I just enquired to IG why their's and Metatraders charts should differ and was given the nelow unsatisfactory reply. I am following up further as it is imperative that the market makers charts exactly match what the real world currency traders are trading or else it is simply guessing based on false information

FYI

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your email.

Our charts run from midnight to midnight so this may be the case that there will be a slight difference to metatrader for example. Our charts are indicative in this matter hence the difference.

Kind Regards,

This is my way of subscribing to this thread. Have read from beginning till I got tired. I think the strategy works but I'd like to ask one question: Do you need any particular candle formation around the third touch of you TL or just pull the trigger if it closes below/above?

If the question has been answered before, still help out please.

Please advise if both trades executed ? What is the result ?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
John ,,,please explain,,,yellow line is inner TL, PRICE touch and gave entry then TL is broken, we draw outer TL (white) which is now valid.

PS : David could we have your input here please.

Dejan

--- 帖子 #654 ---
David , is the 2 trades counted ? if not , why ? Please explain

--- 帖子 #655 ---
the two trades being removed are not counted because of the news. adp non farm is pretty big news. just hope we can get a trade before the actual non farm which comes out friday.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
the outer trendline has 3legs already touched.  the 2nd and 3rd touches are in the middle.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Wow!

You steadfast on that David, apart from the fact it looks as though only the green middle candle touched, it is again a situation where if the close is at or near its low then the opening will also be at the same price and when this happenes do you still call it touching twice ?

From the naked eye it looks a great set up. My 4H charts don't quite match up due to IG markets stuff up. How's this...their 4H charts start one hour before the market actually opens on Mondays! The earlier t/f's are fine!!!

--- 帖子 #658 ---
guys new trade setups for the following pairs nn updated sorry i dont have time for screenshots.

gbp/jpy

eur/jpy

all short positions

please take note of news, will not be trading 1hr before or after for all pairs.

also not that leg2(l2) has to close as a leg

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I think the OP stated from the beginning that the time lapse from the first touch to the second should not be less than 8hrs. The two consecutive touch cannot be that much unless candle is daily.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
These are trades against the daily trend (Countertrend)...

eTrader,

--- 帖子 #661 ---
thanks precap

That is how I understood it originally but thought sometyhing must have changes as the chart in mention is a 4H.

Speaking of 4H charts could someone please post the 4h for Davids pairs just mentioned because how you can get a short on the AUD/USD from a trend line is nothing like what I can get on my charts. I found out IG markets run BST (British Summer Time) and not GMT over 7 months of the year which means 4H charts are different to every other provider who doesn't run on BST. Do all other providers run to GMT do you guys know?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
lol well dont trade them etrader.

im out of gy 41pips! aussie is still running and euro was a no trade

--- 帖子 #663 ---
guys i have exited early for +33 pips for the gbp(closed ealry due to news coming out shortly) i have also closed my aud trade for +5 pips .

etrader this is 4hr method mainly. not daily though i do line up 4hr with daily to confirm  trends that happen in the 4hr peroid.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi debono.

Let me try to resolve some of the confusion. It is normal that every broker has slightly different signals/charts. We have to deal with that in these forums.

Bigger visual differences (candle shape) can also occur easily, as brokers can have different starting hours, or other open/close prices for each candle. Normally highs/lows you want to identify at a defined time are approximately the same at most times - but candles might still look different.

What I want to say is, independent from your brokers price feed, you should still be able to idnetify the highs or lows which David uses as leg "startpoints".

But the problem here is something different. David creates many Trendlines based on quite inconspicuous candle appearances. For this method, david also looks against the dominating maintrend, i.e. smaller retraces (like the one seen on AUDUSD on H4 currently). On H4, the small tips of the candles' shadows are enough for DAvid to use it as a leg for the trendline drawing. One can more easily identify the swings of the main-trend retrace on smaller timeframes, like on my attached screenshot from M30. But David draws trendlines based on H4.

Also, the same happens when you might think it is only the 2nd touch of the trendline. If you zoom in enough, you will see it touched as a leg2, then retraced maybe 10-20 pips, then touched the TL again (leg3). Not so clear to see on H4, though,..

I asked David how reliable he feels them to be, compared to big retraces one would identify easily on H4, like real swings over several H4 candles.

He answered he sees them as reliable as the kind of retraces which he e.g. showed in his 1st post #1.

Hope this helps.

Many thanks Lowen for yout post.

I have been trading FX for a couple of years and have only just discovered this re different open/close times for different brokers ergo different candles.

I must say that this has some rather large implications in my mind as BST and GMT being one hour different has a pretty significant effect on all candles greater that 1H including daily.

We are not trading off pretty pictures and coloured lines, we are trading off the recording of crowd behaviour and re ocurring behaviour based on what we perceive the crowd to see ie bounce off 3rd hot of established trend line. If we all see some thing different ie different highs and lows then this to me seems a falsehood as far as trading off charts.

It is not so much as a forum issue as it is an accuracy issue for mine.

I am told that the pro's trade off mainly 4H and daily with some use of the 1H.

Not sure how true that is but is it is then collectively we are all only redaing the same charts at time frames from 1 hour and less. Definately puts a different perspective on things for me and thanks once again for your insightful post

Nice simple system you have here, congratulations.

You may find the Sweetspots Gold round number indicator I modified useful, to show where the third leg may have good support, without putting lines all over the screen.

The indicator puts Round numbers only on the right hand side of the screen.

Change the shift lines number to make the lines longer or shorter.

Hope you guys find this useful.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi thanks for that but it doesn't semm to open.. cheers

--- 帖子 #678 ---
You mean the Round Number indicator?

No one else seems to have had this problem.

You have to download it, then drop it into the Experts/ Indicator folder of your MT4 then close it down and restart MT4 before you add it to your chart, as with all MT4 indicators.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
ok thank you very much.. i didn't close it down.. i'll do it now.. cheers

And what you did in the case where there were two opposite TLs nearby? You traded both with a smaller TP?

I am new to the system, as till today I have taken bounces on TLs after I see candlesticks patterns on them. Those trades I posted were a group I found when analyzing the charts with my other strategies.

With David's system I have seen entries everywhere! There are lots of TLs in almost everypair; thus, I am not sure if all of them can be taken (but I suppose that they can).

Do you take all trades you see in all pairs?

--- 帖子 #691 ---

What's happening with the nn Dave? Nothing for three days, then 4 successful trades appear? Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
hello Gg33, my nn show 1 gy success and 1 ej no trades since Sun nite

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi Driftwood

Thats what mine showed until a few minutes ago, now it shows 4 successes and 2 no trades?

It would be good if we could get some consistency as I really like this system.

--- 帖子 #707 ---

there were a couple of opportunities accross the pairs so far this week hope all took what they learnt and traded them.

should be good to go by next week. once again apologies

--- 帖子 #709 ---
David did you get the message I sent to you about Paltalk chat?

--- 帖子 #710 ---
guys im back from spain trading will resume as normal for the week. lets make some pips!

guys i have a new eur/jpy trade please check the nn i will enable autoexecute so have it setup properly. i will also log into this paltalk chatroom and be on there from time to time

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Thanks David.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
guys cant seem to attach the candle bar indicator properly. i compile it and it appears under expert advisors but just doesnt appear on chart when i attach it to chart. any help appreciated

--- 帖子 #715 ---
hello david, i am not see ej trade on my fxdd demo can u put chart plz? thx

I shoud say i see L1 but no L2.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
hey drift l2 hadnt formed so it was kind of premature. i was sure that l2 would of formed because the price was alot higher than its low but this didnt happen so i deleted the trade from my nn

--- 帖子 #717 ---
hello david, is on my nn but now i close and open again and gone thx.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
hello drift. i removed the trade. should see some trades today or tomorrow unless the market stays sideways

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I think we should reconsider the paltalk trading room due to the many junks & spams coming into the room. A skype room should be better as u can block such spam and even delete any unwanted comments. In the alternative, Microsoft also has "Teamviewer" which we can also use, as screens can be shared and even taken over by another trader if granted permission by the originator. Just for your consideration guys, so we have an effective trading room.

i took one of these trades last week based on daves method. pretty much did the same thing went above entry by ten or so pips hovered around there for 20 mns then dropped like a stone. hopefully this is the case for this trade.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
In at 133.51 and waiting

--- 帖子 #735 ---
any comments on this on-going trade ?

--- 帖子 #736 ---
im still in might close out break even. if there is enough downward momentum i will stay in

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I'm still in too, but it never looked like breaking through the daily pivot. Looks like it might be approaching for one more attempt.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
whats the daily pivot?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Price is hanging around L3 for too long . aiming for break even as well .

--- 帖子 #740 ---
if it breaks  the L3 trendline , we got some chance for profit . Let hope

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Did anyone here sold heavily ? Looks like market maker wants to take him out . HA HA HA

--- 帖子 #742 ---
hi,

I thought the 3rd bounce has already happened before (red trendline).

Why did you choose the green one, David? On other occasions you mention sth like "the trade did already happen", sometimes you don't. I just want to get into your thinking.

GBPJPY H4:

thankful for explanation, Lowen

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Daily Pivot is at 133.42 but it's now broken through and I'm 25 pips in profit.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
50% fib at 113.08, I'm out at that point

--- 帖子 #745 ---

--- 帖子 #746 ---
guys im out at .08 aswell. probably will drop more but i want to call it a day. a slow but great trade! who traded this one?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Now closed for +44 pips...good enough for me

--- 帖子 #748 ---
40 pips..

what a great day..

thanks guys..

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Great trade guys and thx Dave. I almost missed the boat as my nnhost did not update but luckily I'm alerted immediately a message is posted here. Made it out with some 20 pips after missing another 20 but good enough for me.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Good call on that H4 Touch. Earlier there was a 3rd touch on daily... Is it that we are only focusing on h4, or when a daily is seen we can notify the group.

Please advise.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
hey buddy, your nnhost didnt update? i use the same nn as i have sent to ff for everyone to download.  i got in this trade by the autoexecute feature using it. not sure what happened with you could you send me some more details so if there is a problem i can sort it.

thanks buddy.  All who made on this trade well done.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
+44 Pips

Thanks David .

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thanks Dave - will pm you

--- 帖子 #754 ---
yeah!! that's great..

but now I still get the same trade in nnhost..

I just wait for another trades..

--- 帖子 #755 ---
guys two trades. gbp and eur both are buys. please check nn for update close and open if the trades arent there for some reason.

retail sales and industrial orders are coming out so watch out for them

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I'm not seeing any trades on nnhost..

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Thanks Dave the trades did update on my nnhost but my audio alert is not working. I will check on that too, as it will help a lot when it is enabled.

Cheers

close and open it

--- 帖子 #759 ---
got it now..thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hey guys!

I'v been reading a little up on the thread here. Good stuff!

Here should be a trade on uj happening now that is in line with the thread. Got the 3hit, and its also at 61.8 fib wich adds confluence.

Please correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Would I be correct to say we just got a potential entry on the GBPJPY @ 133.11

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I would think the first touch or should I say the L1 is too far back from the L2 but will leave that to Dave & the other gurus here, as I'm just learning too, but good observation and I like the confluence for additional confirmation.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
anybody in on GJ?

I'm not in yet but waiting for a green candle to bounce off the TL & my other indicators to turn & agree with the trade so I can make

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Agreed - I mentioned mine hitting too in post 762

--- 帖子 #767 ---

I was in for that, 2 lots......nice, still in EJ

GG

--- 帖子 #775 ---
yes one of those trades. what if the news was negative for the gbp would of saved 50pips loss. better to be safe than sorry. not to worry we still have the eurjpy trade

--- 帖子 #776 ---
yeah..that's correct..just wait for EJ now..

there's no news for EJ today, right?

--- 帖子 #777 ---
no news. just orange news for the gbp. shouldnt really affect eur

--- 帖子 #778 ---
could be the other way . its a gamble

Thanks, Lowen

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Please forgive me if this sounds idiotic but would someone be kind enough to upload a picture of the trend line H4 EURJPY, used for the trade this morning.

Kind Regards

Hi Astral,

looking at my nn this is the current picture, not yet triggered the third touch on H4.

Hope it helps

cheers ant

--- 帖子 #804 ---
david,

take a look at your method on the daily, getting really close to a touch, and the momentum may be slowing down?

just my 2 pence worth.

cheers ant

--- 帖子 #805 ---
jakdan close to what touch?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
109.15, third touch??? , just asking, i only started to read the thread today, as im looking for a longer time frame to trade, best of luck with it  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

david, it has took a while but it finally got down to 109.15 with very little momentum so i  have opened a long position on your daily rules?, lets hope its a good one and takes a ride to the top of the existing channel, keep it going and best of luck,

cheers ant

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hi David ,

We need to know your system better . How do you consider a valid trade . Its not just L1 , L2  and L3 , right ?

You can give some examples of In-valid trades as well .

Thanks

--- 帖子 #831 ---
David, I just ran into your thread....very happy to be here.  I've been using a version of your method for a bit.

I use the break of the previous trend line and the second bounce off the new trendline.  I'm getting the same results.  I started to use the Fib as a final deciding factor to enter.  Also some other indicators but I probably don't need them.  It just makes me feel better.  Here's a picture below that's an example.

I get about 20 pips on average off the 15 min chart.  It seems to place me right at the beginning of the long runs especially on the yen pairs....at 5-12pm eastern.  I use 15 pips as a stop loss.  That is usually a little high if I use all the indicators.  If I go more then 15 pip sl then I've made a real mistake or it's fooled me completely.  Doesn't happen often.

It was interesting that your software evaluated a trendline to the bottom of the falling price instead of the top.  I usually place the trend line on the top falling and bottom climbing.  There were three round tops falling..  The pointed reversals were on the bottom.  It was saying to take a counter trade.  And it worked!

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Dammit, David; you owe me big-time. My kitchen is an international-standard health hazard that I was going to spend the afternoon cleaning. Instead, I have spent it reading this thread.

Guys, this and the Nanningbob V5 thread are soul mates. This one shows us how to trade the trend after a bounce off the trendline. Bob's shows us how to catch the retrace after a strong move. We are making a killing over there; you are making a killing over here.

Combine the two methods and the results will be fantastic. Bob's thread is http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=246113. There is no need to read it all; read the first 10 pages or so to get the idea, then skip to the last 10.

I am going to adapt two of my trade-sending ea's for use by the conservative traders here, or for those of you trading more pairs than are set up by nn.

Bob's system involves identifying the setup, then adding the ea to make sure we do not miss the trigger. I shall adapt a buy and a sell ea so that the trigger is the third touch of the trendline, either immediately or at the open of the next candle etc - some time over the next couple of days.

I shall code a semi-automatic trader as well, once I have made a few live trades and am sure I know what I am doing. This may turn out to be unnecessary, but coding trading robots is in my blood.

I am not trying to move people over to Bob's thread; I am about to post a link to this one here. I think a combination of the two trading styles gives us a formidable trading weapon.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Here are the EA's I mentioned in my previous post. There might be bugs - we shall see.

There is a pdf to describe their use.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Wow Steve, you were very busy. Thanks a lot for the EAs.

Btw. what about your kitchen?

--- 帖子 #835 ---
The kitchen could still wipe out humankind.

Bugs in the EA's could wipe out accountkind. Put them on demo until we are sure there are no bugs.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi Steve

I've had a couple of attempts at reading the nanningbob thread but cant make osense of it. Most probably because it has evelved over a long time. Can you point me at a good place to start (maybe one of the earlier evolutions).

I also dont like robots...can the system be traded manually?

GG

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Don't trade forex live, will you? You will lose all your money. If you cannot even start with post 1 of Bob's thread and carry on from there, then you are doomed.

Which bit of, "There is no need to read it all; read the first 10 pages or so to get the idea, then skip to the last 10." is causing you difficulty?"

An asinine post like this in one of my threads would earn you a ban from all of them, so think twice before replying.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
GG

With respect to the thread master I will only mention the other thread this time only. If you go to page 1 of that thread and download the 3 zip files, in one of them you will find word documents, one of them is 30 pages read that first. It is a manual counter trend system and EAs are used to get better timely entrance.

DAVID,

Sir, your thread was bubbling but now it will start Buzzing big time. Steve is one of the best (and some say the BEST) coder in FF. He has a huge following which include some of the best minds in forex. They will soon be visiting and contributing to your thread. You have a fantastic system here and I guess the above mentioned people would assist you in fine tuning and evolution of your system. As Steve says these are exciting times. Thank you for designing and sharing your great system with the FF community.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #839 ---
thanks alot steve for the code really apprecaiate it and im sure the people that follow this thread will aswell. agree with what you stated about mt4 eas in the pdf.  thats why i coded this nnclient in c++ i dont have this problem + works on non mt4 based accounts

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Thanks Astral

That's all I needed.... now I know where to look, I can start reading.... And at first glance it looks like a great system which has been thoroughly researched and tested.

GG

--- 帖子 #841 ---
- - --

David,

I uploaded your system, however I am getting different prompt. When I click the exe it prompted me to a pop-up screen, and I click OK. Instead of the leg1/leg2 it appears gbp/jpy no treads and eu r/jpy not trades... successful. Where shall i go from here. By the way I am new in this thread.

Ed

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Hi Ed

In case David is busy today and this is bugging you big time (I was in the same boat few weeks ago), here is the answer to your post. Do not worry, nothing is wrong, I had the same problem at the beginning. The L1 and L2comes after a possible trade is identified. Normally Monday and Tuesdays nothing much happens and possible trades are identified from Tuesday onwards. For now you have to wait.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Having used the EA's today, I decided to implement the full safety feature I added to the NB ea's.

When you drag the ea onto a chart, it asks for confirmation that you want it loaded. This is in case of re-starting the platform with an ea inadvertently left on a chart

after its job is done.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
--Astral,

Thanks a lot,

Ed

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Thanks Steve for your help here; very much appreciated. David has done a great job sharing his system and you have equally done a great job assisting with the EA. I have started reading Bob's thread and will take my time to understand the system. David's system is very simple and took me about a week to master, and look forward to the same for Bob's system.

Thx you great guys with large hearts and God bless u really good for all your sacrifice and help.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I have added trading times to the ea's. You set your morning trading start time and evening end time to correspond with European trading hours as they are in your own local time.You need no offsets etc; simply think in your own local time.

Here is where life gets difficult for your average coder. Most punters are unable to grasp the simple concept of, 'work out when Europe opens in YOUR OWN LOCAL TIME', and so post a host of questions about this.

Guys, you can suit yourselves. Ask me one single question about this and I will instantly add you to my ignore list. Ask around, and people will confirm that I am ruthless when it comes to protecting my sanity from thickies. Once added to my 'ignore' list: I cannot see said thickies' questions; they cannot post in any of my threads - ever.

Sorry to be so rude, but I have learned not to polite about this. I hope the attached help your trading.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Here is my tp trade from today. Legs 1 & 2 happened quickly, so I set the Trendline Buy ea onto the chart and let it do its thing. The arrow shows the entry; you do not need genius-level maths to work out the tp.

This goes along with an eu tp sell trade from yesterday, and a uc sell that closed at a mptm-managed +10.

Great start for me, using a system astral pointed me to late last week, so it is new to me.

Inexperience hasn't stopped me from starting the auto-trader that astral knew I would be unable to resist coding. Those of you who know my work will not be totally gobsmacked to learn that I have already started work on the auto-trader.

guys trying to load a candle indicator in my mt4 but cant when i attach to chart nothing happens.. any ideas?

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Maybe it calls for other custom indicators, or sometimes could be a font problem.

thanks. its just a candle time indicator would really appreciate if u could upload 1 that works.

Try this it has also main markets time. You have to allow dll imports.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
And this one simpler.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
i have enabled dll imports and have the indicators under expert advisors. still cant attach. not really mt4 person as my broker is web based

--- 帖子 #856 ---
You have to put them in /experts/indicators folder. Than restart Metatrader to compile them.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Hi David.

I found this via Steve's post on the Nanningbob thread. Just finished reading the posts and found the system simple enough to understand which is always a good start.

I got the client and saw the suggested trade. But by the time I understood what the trade information on the client meant it was a bit late to enter but the trade worked out almost exactly as predicted on the client (GBPJPY buy) and would have resulted in 60+ pips!

I thought it is worth mentioning that on the other thread a coder named 'Phover' developed a windows based panel that interacts directly with MT4 and his new version will even trigger trades automatically using an EA loaded into the chart. This may be an idea for the future for your client rather than using the mouse location memory. Please ignore this if it is not suitable for whatever reason.

Thanks for sharing this and for the work you have put in.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
David, do we have a setup here?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
What about this one?

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Hey guys. David, I love your method even more than I did when I read up at the weekend. I have done a few manual demo trades easily and successfully and will go live next week.

I wasn't wrong when I described this and Bob's system as soul-mates.

I have offered up a first draft of an auto-trader for this system at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...56#post3976756

This is a manual system, so I have placed the robot in its own thread to avoid cluttering up this one with discussions about automation.

Have a look and see what you think.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
hey buddy, yes this is a trade.

as for everyone else the gy trade worked out well.  i might be able to get free sms' from a gsm that adds small adds to the text. thinking about implementing this with the nnclient.. as i know some people wouldnt know if they have been executed unless they were watching their charts all the time.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Has anyone tried the Dave486 program on Windows vista?  It won't work and I can't delete the file.  It won't let me.  Had to run restore.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
i am running it on windows vista. not sure what ur doing but a system restore wouldnt remove any applications as it only affects the operating system.

it deletes fine, doesnt run in administrator mode so it doesnt make and os changes. do you also mind elaborating on "it doesnt work" what doesnt work you cant see trades?

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Yah, me too!  I missed it by 20 pips, and didn't risk it!  Nice run though!    I think another is coming on GBPJPY and EURJPY.    Although stochs looking not as good as this morning.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Now it's working again.  I know restore doesn't remove the file.  I had to use restore to get windows to allow me to delete the file.  That one doesn't make sense period!

If it does it again I'll post the error locations.

Hi David.  Got the message on the client as L1=83.97 and L2=84.03.  When I tried to plot the points on the chart  L2 is spot on a HL point but L1 did not correspond with a swing point at all.

Am I reading this wrong?

Another question. I had the audio alert enabled but I don't think it sounded the alarm. Does it sound when ever there is a new trade setup?

Thanks

Z

ill answer your questions for dave as i have asked him the same ones before. the audio alert only triggers when a trade is executed not when a new trade is loaded.  as for l1 and l2 they correspond on mine.

reads l1:8357 l2:84.03

Hello,

I have been trading daily channels with entry on H4 pretty much same set up just using daily to confirm trend.

Today I took AU short +62 half off as I trade MM a little different. Took half and move to break even just to see if I can get a runner.

Great thread....

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Hey Steve great stuff on the EA.  I have searched everywhere and cant find an alert that works with diagonal trend lines can the EA be used as an alert instead of a EA sound/email on multiple charts?

There was one posted here but it doesn't seem to work...

Thanks

--- 帖子 #878 ---
if you do find one please post it. cheers

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Try the attached indi. Double click trendlines and move where ever you want including creating diagonal trendlines. Delete which ever one you don't need. An alert will sound when line is touched.

Regards

Michael

Hey all,

This thread was recommended by Steve Hopwood and I have to say that I am impressed.

Going to try this on demo next week.  i just want to make sure I have the nn set up correctly.

Have there been any updates to it today as I have not seen anything?  It does say "status connected" but just wanted to make sure.

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Hi David,

thanks for the very simple method you have shown here... couple of questions if i may:

1. do you still have a skype chatroom? if yes could you add me please, my ID is grant18265..

2. do you have a break even move for you SL or do you go for TP or SL only

many thanks

Grant

--- 帖子 #882 ---
I also came here after seeing the recommendation from Steve. I am very impressed and looking forward to demo testing this next week and live testing soon.

I will fire up the nn as soon as markets open!

--- 帖子 #883 ---
HEY DAvid Thanks for the heads-up on the USDJPY I traded the bounce for 30 pis on Thursday and caught the breakout on friday. for 80 pips. I know you mostly trade just the bounce but works both ways . Thanks and have a good weekend. MR D.  Always patient

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Onward thank you very much it looks like this will do the trick very sweet. I have it set on GJ 132.80 area im looking for a bounce...going to try it out this could be sweet no more hours in front of the charts maybe i can have someone add email alert to this which would be a nice add on...

Possible short on audjpy?

Signal coming on 4hr tf...looking for entry on 1hr

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Thats not really a trendline, you've drawn horizontal resistance.  Look at how fast price turned from the area, it doesn't look too strong, but you never know!

this method works well on a diagonal line - comments?

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Presently, the 1hr has closed above the TL, but still, the signal stays valid because price is not closed above the TL yet on the 4hr tf.

So I'm still watching this for possible short.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Do you mind teaching me what a real trendline is? The fact that i'm new to FF does not imply that i'm new to Fx trading..I've seen a lot of ego fueling on FF moreso by traders who should still be in the classroom studying the rudiments of fx trading....

Please lets learn to be humble and polite..you just might not know who is who on FF...its better to ask for explanation when you're not clear about anything posted rather than trying to prove you're a professor of Fx trading that knows all...

Ego tripping wont get you anywhere..it only shows your ignaorance....

--- 帖子 #889 ---
trades are only taken from euro start to new york finish and not 1 hour before or after news.

also trendlines with a gradual trend arent usually taken also trends that are drawn from the previous week are not taken.  only trends formed within the week hence the reason why there are only trades generated around tuesday/wednesday

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Thabks John, i'll note timing stated for the purpose of the thread........

Dave,

My nn shows a buy signal on the USDJPY that was apparently for last week - I have looked at that chart - trade looked to be successful, but nn not saying successful. why would that be the case? When does the nn clear out old trades.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Hi John

I didn't realize that. So you are only taking trades where the 1, 2 and 3 occur within the same week ?  I have been banging my head against a wall with my charts as they use BST and not GMT. Some times it doesn't make a difference but others it is significantly different. IT Finance charts are quite extensively used apparently yet they start their charts one hour before the FX markets actually opens hence their 2 hour chart is actually one hour and their 4h chart is actually 3 hours and each candle then starts one hour before GMT charts. That is why there appears some confusion between some charts put up previously in the thread. I thought I would just add this bit for those that wondered why we can have different charts for what should be the same time frame.

I have no definative detail on what percentage of the market traders use GMT and what percentage use BST however it is simply ridiculous that all providers are not the same. Even if IT Finance charts are only used by 20% of the market it still means that 20% of the market are not seeing the same chart structure and making are therefore making different trading decisions.

Anyway, if you are only using the current week then it is easy to work the trendlines with the 1h t/f.

With regard to the comment that it isn't really a trendline. That comment is correct. It would be a stretch to take those points and call the price movement a trend however for the sake of this set up of Davids my question is does it matter?

Is it the 3 hits that are important or should it be a defined trend first?

I think overall everyone should be congratulated on their general good banter and support. It is unusual in any forum not to have ego come into play.

One little thing I have noted since following along. David likes taking the long on a GBP/JPY bounce. I am not sure with you guys but my provider has an 8 pip spread on that pair. EUR/JPY however has only a 3 pip spread and so far when GBP moves against tHe JPY so does the EUR with similar pips gained. FWIW.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Is your description in the original plan? Because I have followed from beginning.

Peace to all!

--- 帖子 #895 ---
You're doing great. I have been printing from aud/jpy and eur/jpy. Thanx for drawing my attention to them.

As for your trendlines, whether they're straight or crooked, it's knowledge that is at stake here. I have many of such TL on my charts and I love them because the print money

And my TLs are valid whether they're from last week or last month or yesterday.

Holla for peace!

Oh dear!

I thought we had a thread where we didn't have this type of postING. I guess not.

Shame.

You try to ask questions and offer help from over 10 years trading full time and you still have the 'kids' trying to throw their weight around.

I guess Steve has the right approach to them.

anyway Dave or others.

A couple of failures with the JPY crosses influenced by news even if the crosses ocurred more than an hour away.

I am still interested whether you trade the 'hits' with a trend or support/resistence or both.

By the nature of the market we must have failures in any case or else the market will forever trend in one direction so I am less concerned with failures and more concerned with set up. If it is being auto bot traded then I am thinking thinking that it must simply take the trade on a third hit regradless of whether it is a tend or it hits support/resistence.

One other little point I have noticed whilst looking for strength through confluence is that if you have your pivots showing and the trend line crosses through the pivot it is surprizing how often this point is a strong bounce point whether the 3 hit or 4th 5th etc

--- 帖子 #906 ---
i have been trading this thread since dave posted. the rules are simple. not to trade 1 hr before or after news.  now if the news is high impact and deviates greately from the forcast it can still stuff a good trade due to the bull or bear rally. going on these rules + a bit of trading intuition trading the 3rd bounce based on nothing but a bounce has yielded me 8 in ten trades success. nothing is 100% but 80% is good for me. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Thanks John

Are you trading long and short. I think Dave was just trading long?

Alos are you only trading the 3rd hit ie if it comes back and hits it again a day later do you ignore it or trade it?

I agree a bit of trading nous is always required and things are never black and white. The cause and rapid decline in price on JPY crosses indicated that traditional resistence lines may be broken.

My point however is that if it is auto botted then hat can't be taken into consideration automatically. It still requires human intervention to decide on whether the trades would be set up in the NN as an example.

Not a big fan of auto bot trading but then I am pretty ignorant in this area so my views count for little.

Thanks for the reply

Hello, I am currently testing this strategy. However, I am a new at this trendline scalping technique and I need some advice from the more experienced user of this strategy on several things as follows:

1. I know that the thread starter usually trade GBP/JPY using this strategy (due to its high volatility), however, does this strat. works well for other pairs too?

2. If it does work for other pairs, do we need to make adjustments to the TP and SL set up?

Any advice or suggestions are welcomed.

My attention was brought to this and asked to confirm if this is a Trendline or not as the show of tantrums is getting some here confused as to who is right and if the line drawn is indeed a correct Trendline or just an Horizontal line.

Well let me say categorically that i feel highly over rated to be called upon to put a stamp of authority on this issue, would have preffered my seniors in the business to do that.

There are 2 charts in this referred post by Ftafx [your user id bothers me]. The first chart by own understanding of a TL shows indeed a true and correct TL going by the simple characteristics or definition of a TL [we have a complete wave cycle of ABCD and the TL drawn clearly joined the A and C points.].

The 2nd chart however, is what i think is causing this show of gladiators [forgive my sense of humour if it offends you]. Going by the appearance on the chart posted, it would appear not to be a TL. But i think what Ftafx did was to show the 4hr TL on the 1hr time frame [i have a similar thing on my charts too] and then did not show on the thread, the origin of the TL as appeared on the 1hr tf.

I would want to conclude that Ftafx traded this signal my own way and not exactly as Dave does, so i take the blame for the confusion here. I will get in touch with Dave and seek his permission to remove my posts so we can have a uniform way of trading here, afterall its his thread not mine.

I hope i've been able to put to rest this issue and i plead there should be no more exchange of unpleasant words. Let's not get this beautiful thread stained with such please.

Clean thread gives clean pips, and i love them pips.

Happy pipping to you all.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Hello guys,

I'm new here. I have followed you step by step so far. I tried this method the first 3 trades. However, I lost them all.

I think the weakness point of this method is blind point at which the 3rd-bounce-candle break trendline instead of bouncing from the gradient.

Just one thing I want to put forward to us is how to avoid this trap, how to identify this point. I'm still working on this...

I made my trades as the pics below. I appreciate it very much if anyone can tell me what I did wrong.

By the way, thank you for all your shares, contributions to us Dave, D liberator and other mems.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Please forgive me to answer this question myself.

I think we need to turn back to smallers timeframes so that we can enter the trade more precise.

Was I wrong friends?

--- 帖子 #918 ---
press ctrl-y so it shows a new week.  trades arent generally taken from a previous week especially for gbp/jpy.  this was mentioned earlier on in the thread from what i rememebr. the gbp/jpy trade was a success last week. this week the trend is bearish and the reason why there are no trades is because of the sudden drop/ bearishness in the trend.  These trades are usually taken with a more modest trend(where at least you can draw the line and have the 2 legs form)

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Thank you very much john19r !

I'm not sure about this too.

By the way, could you help me about Dave's NN? Why I did click ok but it always showed only USDJPY like this? Of course, I have checked it for almost 3 days long.

Thank you john19r, thank you !

well i spose it should say no trades though its still showing the usd/jpy trade from last thursday.

Hey guys,

Yes, me. But as you can see, the trendline has been broken already, so the setup is not valid anymore.

Hello,

It broke the trend drew from 2 legs.

How can we avoid this trap brothers?

--- 帖子 #931 ---
That's the point fguru !

How can we determine it will bounce or break the trend?

--- 帖子 #932 ---
How about GBPJPY?

I'm still not figuring this out !

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Unfortunately thats the problem, we cant know whether price will break the trendline or bounce. I think if we knew, then we would be all millionaires, lol.

Sorry, I dont know the answer.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
I think the trendline on GBP/JPY is too steep (same with USD/JPY), maybe there must be a bigger retrace.

Check out EUR/JPY, I think this could be a valid trade.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
You're so funny fguru.

I think we should wait for the next candle to become a bounce-candle in 15m timeframe.

You said that as if we had gambled with the ratio of 50/50...

--- 帖子 #936 ---
I took the EUR/JPY trade, because it was a bounce from the trendline and a pullback from the 13 EMA.

If you check now USD/JPY then you will see it just pulled back from the 13 EMA.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
It does not hit EMA 13 in my platform. That means you should open a trade and I dont?

Uhmm...  I have many questions which need their answers.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Hm, different brokers have different data feed. Can you show me your chart with the 13 EMA on it?

However this system doesnt use any moving averages, it is just me using the 13 EMA, as I have made better experiences with trendlines + 13 EMA.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Here you are fguru !

My broker is Tadawulfx.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Im using Forex.com and IBFX and on both charts there was a pullback on the 13 EMA.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
It's okay. I dont have any argument here.

Oh, by the way, could you tell me how many percent you have won so far?

Sorry Dave, I don't mean to irritate you. I'm in the first steps using this method. Just want to know how it works for other friends.

You're good and open person, right Dave?

Thank you for your share very much !

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I would say I win 60-70% of the trades. Problem is that I normally trade during wrong times. I sleep during London session and I think this is the time when David wins most of his trades.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hey, look at this guys,

Can we short here?

--- 帖子 #944 ---
That's wonderful enough fguru.

We will become millionaires gradually.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Well, my chart looks complete different than your chart. I wont short AU (because of the 13 EMA).

I just wanna throw something out there for discussion.  When I draw a trendline I try not to look for the second point to soon, give the market time to move around.

Also, I try not to draw them off of consolidation areas.  Price pivots are better (not pivot points), this is an area where price was rejected and turned around, which is NOT consolidation.

What I do to train myself is to go back and draw trendlines where price did break out, and see how the lines connected to price.  This also gives me an idea if the pait actually respects trendlines.  The one thing you cant do is determine if the price moved from news or if it was just pending orders sitting around.

I saw another comment in this thread saying that the trendlines was too steep (a comment on someones chart) and I have also noticed that.  Problem here is when you go to lower timeframes and zoom in, the line isn't steep anymore.  To solve this I draw my lines on 4 hour charts and above.  Then I zoom in to snap the line to price.

This is how I look at angled lines, horixzontal lines are different in that they are more bases on levels.  The wmd thread talks about this (and there is a PDF in the thread you cant grab to read it without the noise).

My major killer is overtrading - I look for trends on too small of timeframes to force a trade.  I keep tell myself to stay away after the trade loses, but then it happens again.  Maybe I'll print my guidlines and post them on my monitor.  The good news is that I'm still making pips, I just have to get rid of the bad trades.

Does anyone else approach trenlines like this?

Suggestion: Post trades that worked, post trades that didn't work - compare, gain insight. I think everyone can learn from this (don't get me wrong, I'm no pro, I just think we can all learn from seeing closed trades)

The EA I use to tade trendlines does a screen capture when the trade closes, makes it easy to look at all trades.

Sam Seiden odds enhancer - a checklist for trading

This guy is a trainer at Online Academy, they send out free news laetts that are good reading on supply and demand.  If your sick of indicators, sign up.

In my opinion, indicators are great for EA's (how else would a computer know whats going on...) but for manual trading, trendlines work, not all the time but they make me pips and thats why I'm here.

I remember a few years ago spending so much time coding, I forgot to watch the screen and learn price action. My eyes opened when I zoomed into a potential horizontal line breakout and watch the 1 minute struggle to break it.  You can see it let go.  It looks like a guy running for a bus with his buddies holding him back, he fights them off after a while and BAM - price goes out of the range like a mini news release.  Anyways, I still suck at it, making pips but also making lots of mistakes, luckily the math of risk management helps.

GJ is forming another beautiful TL channel this week.  Anyone following it?

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Hi Coolshades, looking at your charts, if you put in "show period separators" on you charts, it would be easier to remember that we are only looking at the current week trendlines for trades. I know I love to look at the broader specturm too and the current week seems confining..but the current week only rule keeps us focused.  My 2 pips worth.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Anyone in this trade?

--- 帖子 #994 ---
arent there more than 3 touches to that tl? i was under the impression that 2 touches were required, with entry on the 3rd touch.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
I entered on the third touch.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
hello coolshades, i see like u but 2 candle before was very near line but not touch for me so i see lawgirl trade is good but i not take coz not see before now.

hello lawgirl, how many stop and profit do use on this pair plz? thx

--- 帖子 #997 ---
I didn't put a SL in because I was watching the trade.  TP of 50.

Just took second trade ..short on this pair. First trade was long for 50 pips although could have stayed in until the top of trendline channel was touched... which would been over 100 pips. As daily and weekly trend is down, this short trade should be "easier".

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
hello lawgirl21, why youre top line starts not at high of candle? Candle open now is only 2nd touch for me on fxdd.

ok, i see may be coz u trade channel u talk about.

Good nzdusd trade u had

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Thanks DW...as I see it, trendlines, as with  resistence and support levels, are not exact science..rather a range.  I adjusted the diagional line, but it didn't change anything.  Yes, I am channel trading, using this 3 touch system.  I do not want to offend anyone and if I am "straying" from the thread, please just let me know and I will no longer post.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
hello lawgirl21, sorry i don't mean any bad i just ask to get me better at this. Plz do not stop posting coz of my question coz all is good for all our learning imo. thx for youre reply.

Hi David

Thanks once again for showing us this simple but very effective method. I think we have an army of traders here who wish to be on your sms list (needless to say I am in also). Keep up the good work.

Kind regards

I just entered a short trade here.  Daily and weekly trend is down, so I'm thinking this should be a winning trade.  We'll see...

hello

jus recently added using trendlines to my trading strategy (used to be loyal to my 2EMAs that is consistently giving me good profit) but there are times when the trend starts a few candles (4 H) prior to the EMA crossing so i am trying to see what TL has got to do with it

quite interesting, i just started exploring it since last night

new journey and wish to learn from other's experience and lessons

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
hows everyones week, had a couple of bullish setups accross the pairs but nothing hit for the thrid line. would of been good if it did they all boomed.

as for sms alerts i will start adding the code to my server

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
How about this?

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Stopped out.  -50 pips.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
i believe Dave uses the major trend lines.  SOme  of your charts look like secondary trend lines.  i use them myself from time to time but i don't think you can expect his normal win ratio with these lines.  that has been my experience.  also, i use price action with these secondary lines....i don't just enter on the third tap...i need to see movement in my direction

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
I agree, PA is my main "indicator" also. Not exactly sure what you mean by major trend lines, unless you mean overall trend direction which I look to daily and weekly PA to determine. But, with Dave's method, we are confined to looking at the current week's H4 bars, so that, to me, doesn't allow for "major trend lines", except as I said above, for overall direction.

Several of my charts and trades were clearly channel bounce trading and I tried to make it clear that my way of trading channels was not clearly Dave's and that I would not post if there was an objection to it...but a couple of the pairs were in beautiful channels over the past 3 days and I could not pass them up. Only one of my posted trades (mostly channel bounce trades) has been a loser and that is probably because I did not watch it.

Thanks for your response. I enjoy talking trading. I thought maybe this thread had died and that I was talking to myself.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
I just happened to land here by chance and saw this chart. I don't want to disturb the dialog, but I do have a quick question for you, lawgirl.

Was this particular trade based on anything other than the chart pattern, and the fact that the higher tfs were all pointing down?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Out with +26 pips.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Yes, and the fact that a beautiful channel had formed..trading channel bounces is one of my favorite ways to trade.  I actually was more confident that this  was a winning trade than any other of my recent trades...just goes to show what the market can do  and how being too confident can back fire.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Yeah, I hear ya.

You know, I was going to say that you may want to start considering having some fundamental bias to your trading decisions. For example, that NZD long you took probably should have been left alone due to economic factors.

I know a lot of people walk around here preaching that price is everything, and that nothing else matters... unfortunately they're wrong. You seem to have a good grasp on technicals. I bet if you polished up your fundamental understanding of the market you'd be a pretty sharp trader.

Not criticism, simply observation. I happen to think you're a gifted chartist, with discipline firmly in place. If you start trading the entire picture you could be a potential fund manager one of these days.

Best of luck,

MM

I'm at work so I don't have time to go through the charts but....

There's been a ton of trend lines we could have traded on the 4 hr chart this week.  I've been going up in tf to be sure there isn't a daily trendline that is close...if so I consider the higher time frame.  I've noticed the price goes thru to the next line more times then normal.  Dave can correct me if I'm wrong.  It hasn't been 8 out of 10 wins this week on the 4hr charts.

I'm not getting any trades on his software this week so I'm guessing there's a reason....I've seen a mess on the 4hr charts.

Here's an example happening right now.  The top red line is the daily.  The other is the 4 hr.   It's okay on this chart but I've seen it go much more then 50 this week.

OTE=lawgirl21;4008407]I agree, PA is my main "indicator" also.

Thanks for your kind words, I do love charts.  And thanks for the constructive criticism.  I use to try to keep up with fundamentals but eventually decided that fundamentals were crippling me ...meaning I was getting "analysis paralysis", so I rarely pay attention anymore.  Can you recommend a concise source for market outlook?  Thanks again...I so enjoy trading ideas.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Well, let's make this a little more interesting...

For one, there is no "concise source for market outlook"... which probably explains you getting "analysis paralysis".

Let's simplify...

See if you can figure out which country is the current global leader in economic growth and prosperity by simply doing some good old fashioned Google searches.

This is my second trade today on this pair. First long - +26 pips. Time will tell what the short will do.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I took that one too....I went in a little later.  After the the second reversal candle on the 4hr.  The big triangle on the daily looks nice.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
I'm glad to have company!  It will be fun to see what happens.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Anyone watching this pair?

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
CAD/ JPY - This is worth watching. (this is a 1 hr chart)  I just took it off the main trend line for 40 pips.  It's been bouncing off it for a while.  There's one coming down worth watching.  It may be a big drop when it breaks the 38.2 fib.  It didn't get it's 3rd tap yet.  Look at it on the daily.  A nice big triangle if you want to do the bouncy woncy.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
I've never traded that pair.  Will look at it.  Thanks

How many setups do you get on this system a week. How are you getting on with the sms sigals? What about the USD/CHF setup at the moment

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
hello david, my nn only shows ej no trades and au no trades.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
apologies about the trade not updating in the nn, i forgot to press update..

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
No I went with the down trend and went off the main trend line...it wasn't beautiful taps but it's been falling of the line for a week and was a good trade for 40 pips. I was waiting for the one falling to tap the 3rd time...it did but broke thru, back up towards the main trend line....another good example of a break thru towards the master trend line.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Got out with +13 pips.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
I stayed out of that trade, but enjoyed following it.  Are in in anything now?

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
it's 6:21pm eastern....E/J has tapped 3 times going up.  Looks like a double bottom type.  It's only about 10 pips off the line.

Got in a little late but....pfg best showed a little different chart then IBFX.  PFG showed the three taps.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Took 18 pips x 2 units on E/J....got in late so didn't go for max on my live account.  I'll run my demo a bit more.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Lawgirl,

It just dawned on me.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  You're trading the channels with 3 bumps of the main trendlines and triple bumps of the lines between the main top and bottom line.  Hummm...sounds very powerful.  How's your win ratio?

Like this chart on 4hr???

Also here's a 1 hr chart of the same thing.  Holy moly...this looks powerful.  Using the channel and intermediate trend lines it makes the main trades longer.  Using the third tap on the intermediate line gives me the ability to stay in about 20 pips longer....after starting the trade at the third tap of the top main trendline. (on 1 hr chart)

I noticed something very interesting on the 1 hr chart.  The last little tail (on the third chart) had three taps on a little trendline going to the bottom main channel line.  This said that the price was going to fall below the bottom main channel line....and it did.  Notice it...I will pay attention to this from now on before entering...on the 1 hr chart.

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
You are so kind to us David.

Thank you for your help so far.

I don't know how we can return our favors to you? hic

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Sorry for the late response, I was out for the day.

I like your H4  EU chart and would have been ready to go long once PA tapped the bottom line for that third time.

You are right about my channel trading.  I would add, I only trade pairs that I can confirm direction on the weekly, daily, and H4 charts.  I don't care what H1  is doing as long as the other three are in the same direction. I use RSI to do this.  That way I always know if a potential channel trade is a trend or countertrend trade. I do a quick scan of about 12 pairs and eliminate all that direction does not confirm on the 3 TFs.  This generally leaves me with about 3 pairs.  Then I watch.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
I've been trading the channels and triangles the same way.....Seems to work well. `Counter trend is were I usually lose money.  I'm cutting counter trade out completely.  I'm going thru all the pairs also....I get about the same...2-4 pairs to trade.  It is amazing how the triple tap on a trend line is such a fine indicator of the coming payoff.

The one thing I liked about the 1 hr chart (as a last check before entering...I always use 4hr or better for everything else) was that just before it came to the bottom channel line it triple tapped a small trendline on the 1 hr chart. It didn't show on the 4hr. It told me it was going to go thru the line and it did. I'd rather wait until it recrosses back up over the bottom channel before I enter just in case it decides to keep going. We've all seen it keep falling when all indicators said it should rise......for a long time.

The direction thing makes sense. So your not taking counter trades at all? Are you winning better then 10% of your account / month?

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
As per using a quick peek at the 1 hour chart (looking for a 3 tap trendline) before the final 3rd tap of the 4 hr trendline.....

If I can identify that the price will fall through the bottom channel then I get two advantages.  If you truely believe the trade will be good.....

1.  I can reduce my stop loss.  I still calculate 50 pips from the original entry point but I can figure it will drop 20-50 pips.  When I see bull price action on a lower tf chart then I can enter yet still keep the original stop loss.  It reduces potential loss a lot.

2.  Also I can get a few more pips on the trade by entering below the trendline.

Last night E/U dropped about 25 pips below the trendline entry point before it reversed and went up.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Yes, I do countertrend trades... really I would call them re-trace or pullback trades..within the overall trend. I just don't expect as much from them as I might a  full blown trend trade so my TPs are lower.  (tell me if this doesn't make sense).

I have not wanted to talk about using the H1 charts too much, as this is not what this thread was set up to study, but I believe you are correct in stating that confirmation on the H1 makes for a more powerful trade.  I got my last winning trade of the week this morning shorting GJ, entering on the third tap of the H1 chart.

My goal is to average $500 per day, 4 days per week.  I am hitting that average.  I do trade other systems though.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
What other systems are you using?  I'm using some of nanning bob's and some of the TDI stuff.

I can tell you're a die hard....only the die hards are here on a friday night.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
A good week for me trading David's method - or my understanding of it anyhow.

Mostly, I trade nanningbob's V5 method. If you are fully confident with trading David's system here, then visit http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=246113 to read about his system. It is a retrace, or 'counter-trend' system and both methods complement one another beautifully.

Since 2nd August, I have painlessly increased the balance of my account by 19.17%. Roughly 20% of this profit I generated using David's trading system. This is in two weeks of live-trading it and only looking at the 4 majors + GJ charts - remarkable.

What I am finding is that Bob's method generates lots of trades that hit their breakeven regularly. David's method generates trades far more likely to carry on to their +50 tp.

Lovely stuff David. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
These are the two systems I am studying now as well. Using both on demo until I feel completely confident I know what I am doing. I have 2 systems I am using live right now that are doing quite well, but think these could be as good or even better.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
LG,

how do you exit a trade?do you absolutely wait for sl or tp to be hit without intervention? or close trades early? i am assuming your sl and tp are 50 points on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
also, does anyone have any indicator for the weekly period separator on h4.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
excellent work steve, i appreciate the feedback + the fact you are successful with my method. great to see. are you using your ea for the entries or manually entering?

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
With an open chart go to "Charts" --> "Properties" --> "Common" --> and check "Show period separaors"  That's all you need.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
I do not use an absolute SL or TP level unless I am going to sleep or will be away for hours, then I will use the 50 pips SL/TP.  Otherwise I generally use support/resistence levels.

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Are we missing good trades by not analysing what I call bridge candles and PA. Take a look at these wonderful trades the past 2 weeks on GJ alone. First for almost 500 pips, second for over 200.

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
I followed this thread for a few days until it got taken over.

It looked like a viable method.

It looks like the take over artist has moved on. I'll start looking at it again.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
Hi just read this thread over the weekend, interesting, gonna demo it on oanda this week, going to incorporate a multi lot system i use as well, will post results,

good stuff!!!

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
That's exactly what I was talking about with the stuff I mentioned.  I'm looking at one right now.  It's deadly!!!

I added it to your chart and both your lines are dead on!!!

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
The first "bridge" is not a trendline but an arbitrary upper channel line which you shorted off the bounce.  The second "bridge" makes more sense since it's more of a legit trendline.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
I am using the ea's I posted here to make the entries. There is also the auto-trader, but this is still experimental and going nowhere near my live account.

I draw the trendline once I can identify a reasonable pair of legs (sounds kinky ). Then I set the appropriate David 4H Trendline Buy/Sell EA and leave it to do its thing. This way, I do not have to monitor the charts in order to pull the trigger.

Mind, the ea's pay no attention to other factors that might affect my decision to take a trade. All they do is pull the trigger on the third touch/pierce of the appropriate trendline. Thus they may not suit everybody.

They save me a shed-load of chart-watching.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
Nothing arbitrary about it, as I see it. I just did not extend too far back into the week when drawing my TL, as that is not what this thread is about...but there are trend lines a plenty. Point is there was a beautiful set up for that 500 pip move down and I missed it..hope to not do that again.

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
I understand - what i was saying is it technically is not a trendline, but an upper channel line.  In an up trend the trend line connects the bottoms not the tops.  That's why i said your second example has more validity.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Yes, you are correct.  I have allowed my nomenclature to get sloppy.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
who's the take over artist??

Good luck for you tho!

Examine this statement.

By whom would the intervention be made?

Who says it will be made?

Why should it be made?

If it is made, will it make any difference?

Need I go on?

Why should the markets care whom is the PM of Japan? Dem markets dey go up, den dey go down, den dey go up again...........................

We have been having a laugh at this sort of guff in Bob's thread. Stay out of the market if you do not want to be in it, but not because some dipstick says something that has no backup factual information.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Hi,

Just to confirm the techinique of using this method. we draw a TL and when the candlestick touches the third time we enter the trade??

But how we determine the exit point.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Fundamentally, yes.  Although there are nuances.

Dave uses 50 for SL and TP.  I use support/resistence levels.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Hi Lawgirl,

Thanks. But i should only enter the trade when its just started or even during the candlestick???

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
At historic lows...

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
I think it depends on how risky we are willing to trade.

By the way friends, what should we do in some cases like below with one downtrend and then one uptrend?

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
Look for your bias on larger time frames.  I have found that by mid-week, generally, the directional bias has been set by the weekly timeframe...so that is my measuring stick in most cases.  Of course, if PA is showing something else..go with PA.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Weekly, daily..even monthly bias for GJ is short...any other direction, IMHO, would be a countertrade.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Thanks lawgirl21 !

By the way, with your experience, do you think we should enter the countertrade like that? Is it a little risky, right?

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
I won't tell you to enter a trade, or not.  Countertrend trades are riskier than trend trades, and trend trades are risky in and of themselves.  So depends on your comfort level and tolerance for risk.

I enter countertrend trades all the time in what I call channel trading.  But they are generally well controled and within specific parameters.  Most are successful, some are not...like all trading.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Hi All,

Is this a possible trade setup

--- 帖子 #1105 ---

I dont see any trend forming. Seems like to action tonight

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Exactly,  if I can..meaning if I can get to the computer.  I have a full time job, but am self employed so that helps.

I have 6 regular pairs that I watch.  I try to scan them at 10, 2, and 6 a.m. and/or p.m.  Obviously I miss the 2:00 a.m. scanning most of the time.  Often I am late for a trade i.e. I don't get there at the third touch on a new H4 candle.  I then have to decide to take the trade anyway or not.  That last trade I posted, I was very late on, but took it anyway because I thought it had a lot more ride to it.  It did, I was lucky.  Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
So you set certain intervals for looking out for trends? I looking at about 4 pairs, dun seem to have any trend currently.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Hi, possible trade setup?

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Look at this chart now...up over 400 pips!

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
which 6 pairs if i can ask?

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
EU, GU, EJ, UCHF, GJ and NZDUSD..but I really don't think it matters which pairs you pick.  I will look at other pairs if someone points out that something is happening on them.  My limit to 6 pairs is completely arbitrary..becuase I can't analyse and "control" more than that.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Maybe you should tell my expanding bank account.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
your period separators, your chart would be easier to analyze. The separators also help to keep focus.

This was a winning trend, but, IMHO is now too late to enter. I have been watching it too, but missed it. I personally would not enter it now, although it may go up a 100 or more pips further.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
10, 2 and 6:00 am/pm is my local time on my particular platform at which the H4 candles are formed i.e. a new candle starts at 10:00, a new candle starts at 2:00, a new candle starts at 6:00...ad nauseam.  Everyone should know the times of formation of new H4 candles  for their time zone, on their particular platforms.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
Lovely channel. I'm looking to go short if PA continues down. This would be a counter trend trade and more risky, but if it continues down and taps the bottom line, it will be a 3rd tap for a move up again.

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Did you get in to E/G lawgirl.   Took a quick 16.  Had 20 but it jumped like a frog backwards.  It will probably drop another 20 or so....hummm...maybe not...just broke trend line.  My white teeth are showing!!!

83.5% win ratio so far this week....10 wins...2 losses.  Funny to say but, I should have had 1 more win....made a mistake!     Way up in pips.

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
are you just trading this method?

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
No I didn't. Went to dinner with my family and missed it.  What are you looking at now?

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Yes...I've dropped everything else.

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Went in late a little bit ago and took 10 pips off E/J.  I've pretty much made my goal for today.  I'm relaxing.  I'll let you know if I spot something.

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Is this trade valid, seems so.. feel like taking it if it touches the 3rd time

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
I am in it.  Try it on demo first and move to live if there is movement.  It has been slow in moving down.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Hi Cugirl,

this method seems to be working great for you. any idea what pairs should i run and hows your equity like since you use this method?

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
thanks do we trade only when it touches or anyone trades it moving down to touch it then trade again when it touches?

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
It works on all pairs.  You may have to adjust for some because they don't move as much.  I don't take a set 50 pip TP so you'll have to make your own way with that.  Use the 50 pip TP if you're not comfortable with anything else. You can use the EA's if they work with your broker.

Use the 1-3% thing.

This system works.  Hear me....it works!!!  Hear me...it works! Trust it, follow the rules and do it on a demo until you can say....it works.  You can expand a bit on the trades after you are comfortable with it.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
....make sure it touches.  Try to catch it right when it touches or use the EA's.  You can be a little more liberal on entry after the touch but you want a touch.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
I have followed the instruction and put it on demo for a month. However, no trade could be triggered. I have set Buy/Sell button without moving the trade window a bit. May I know how to solve it?

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
Go in manually then.  I can't help you.  I do it manually.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Actually might as well use the trendline alert and buy/sell ea combo. in that way we can learn more.

--- 帖子 #1141 ---

Don't know...stopped using it a week ago...

The trades look good ....extend the line for a third tap.  like it when the first tap is at a retrace.

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
PA did come down and tap bottom line for 110 pips.  Now back up again.

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Lawgirl,

I'll give you a "nice job" if you'll post those before the third tap.

E/G....maybe....

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Yeh, that 3rd tap happened at the 10:00pm candle, so I could have had it but was just too tired.

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
Theres no triple tap here.... is there?

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Are you looking at a countertrend trade for EG?

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
yes...then down to the master 3rd tap.  I'm watching the 1 hr for the 3rd counter tap. Actually there's 3 on the 30 min.   Should be worth a few pips.  maybe 10-15

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Yes there is..just my trendline drawing was a little sloppy.  Remember that there are no exact numbers that we are dealing with here.

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
EJ is taking off.  Full trend trade.  Weekly, daily and H4 are all long.

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
GU tapped the bottom line for 3rd time and is now heading up for a full trend trade long.  Weekly, daily, H4 charts are all long...even monthly.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Hi Lawgirl,

to get a valid trade does it mean to have longer 4 hr candles? i was looking at USD/CAD the candles are rather short

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
USDCAD is range bound now. I would stay away from it.

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
thanks everyone for sharing, at least i know now i am doing things right.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
I just want to ask anyone with much experience how you manage news when you're already in a trade

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
LAWGIRL,

Thanks for the heads up on G/U and E/J....just sniped E/G for 8 pips.  Love those little baby tap things but they can get me in trouble every once in a while.

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
cugirl, you play with m15? what stoploss do you use ?

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
I take counters from time to time....especially in a channel or triangle. I probably shouldn't because that's were you'll lose more often....but...with three taps they usually work out.  I don't want to hijack Dave's thread.  If you do it...go for minumums.  These are not plug and play trades.  You baby sit them.

Do the basic system first....you'll see the extra trades after a while.

I don't take any trade without evaluating it on all time frames.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
I'm newly registered here but have followed this thread a good deal and appreciate all the insight here.  The GU looks to be in a possible downtrend with the 3rd tap on the current candle.  This may be a counter trade.  I'm curious if anyone else sees it this way as I improve my skils with this method.  Also, the AUDUSD seems to be in a downtrend too.  Comments?

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
it looks up to me on the 4hr daily and week. im on a phone so the charts are small.  i do see three taps above on a horizontal line

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
Any thoughts on USD/ JPY?

It's bumping a horizontal line.  I have other indicators that say it's maxed at the high?  A good drop on most pairs of JPY....on open tonight?  Sooner?

G/J looks similiar.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Thanks for the reply.  It looks to be working out that way (up).  The AUDUSD does seem to be working out as a short after a 3rd touch.  I think I'm getting the hang of this.  Demo for now.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
I think all indicators are up on anything related to the JPY because the central bank in Japan has taken steps to devalue the currency, hence the big jump in everything XXX/JPY on 9/15.  That makes me want to stay away from these pairs until we have more data in a few days and things settle out.  I do believe these will drop, but it gets scary when the gov't steps in to move currencies.  To me when that happens "all bets are off."

Dave

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Sorry, I'm late getting to charts.  I don't like that spike, though I beleive there is plenty of up room (look at the daily and weekly) left.  Weekly, daily are long.  Another 3 touch formed after the spike.  Will be interesting to watch.

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
The double top says it's maxed unless it does something very unusual. It looks a lot like the makings of a double top on the 1hr.  The thing is the spike up from the other day was artificial.  I think it will drop, at least some, tonight.  The kicker will be if it breaks the line you drew.  The bottom line.

I'm wondering if the long line means down???

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
G/U may be reversing....it's tapping a horizontal line.   Watching G/J...it's tapped a horizontal line two times....I think all the JPY pairs are maxing.  Some of the other pairs seem to have been caught up in the japanese manipulation this week....I'm thinking lots of pairs may try to find their true value tonight....which is down.

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
I'm not seeing it.  GJ is long on weekly, daily, H4 even monthly TFs and has alot of run to resistence levels yet.  GU looks pretty much the same.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
I hear you on the higher TF's.  The lower TF's are starting to move down.  the 1 hr is falling a bit....bouncing down off the horizontal line.  Also, some people may be taking profit after the wild week.

Look at the red line on the TDI.  It's bending on the 4 hr.

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
The EurJpy trade doesn't look good. 3rd tap already but looks it's going down

Where is the 3rd tap?

Movement in EJ and EU.  Both going up.

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
Hope you get it!!!  Wish you well!!

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
I've been in both of them most of the day.  Also long GU.  How about you?

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
Actually, I just entered EU.

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
I've been very careful today.  All the JPY charts have major resistance..... 112.38 for e/j....it may break it.

Up a few pips.  Not staying in for the long haul today.  My short was good on G/J but didn't stay long.  I don't like what I'm seeing.  It doesn't want to do anything.  I think the japanese thing has effected all the pairs in one way or another.

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
Sometimes that's just how it is.  I didn't have a chance to do much until tonight, but more than doubled by goal in the last 30 min.  Will call it quits for the evening.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
i am waiting for the third tap

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
On my chart the 3rd tap did not actually tap, still ok to enter?

so meaning we need not go by hard and fast rule to see a tap?

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
Are you waiting for a short trade?  I'm not understanding that chart.

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
Our charts appear to be very different.  Yes, wait for a third tap to enter.  I sometimes wait longer than that to observe price action.

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
yes waiting for short trade.. am i ok with this as i understand daily is uptrend still

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
gosh.... broker time difference make so much difference...

My first trade with this system too had a negative with nz/usd. No beginners luck! Maybe i did something wrong.

Are the nn signals working for you all? I am not able to run the nn......After pressing the OK button no TL1 does not come.....help required to setup the nn. I did view the video 3 times though.

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
NN seems to be disconnected. its shows disconnected.

Does this triple tab has some rules we miss out? like under certain condition we are not suppose to enter trade..

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
We probably have to have a re-read of the complete thread and hope someone would step out to give a feed back. Also we may probably have to have a look at the previous charts discussed. Does this method has a 'no trading on Friday' as with some other strategies?

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Not sure what David using. Buy i am using IG markets. their margin requirements are werid......Thinking of changing a broker....

The USD/CAD looks to be making a 3rd touch on a long range trend from tops at August 31 and Sept 8.

Just entered GU long.  It is trading perfect channel.  Monthly, weekly, and daily are all long.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
You are forgetting a fundamental rule!  Only trade the current week.  It is really not important for the 3 tap system what previous weeks have done.  You are making this far too complicated.

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
lawgirl21,

I agree this is a nice set up and just got in too. Thanks for sharing this. If you have time, could you give your take on the USDCAD? This looks good to me too.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
I'm staying out today....too many mixed signals for me.

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
GU up 25 pips.

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Thank you lawgirl for your chart and your posting indeed give a chance for newbie like me to think about an entry. In this instance I too had taken the trade with a small profit.

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
Thanks.  I missed that in the rules.  I'll keep it simpler.  Thanks for your help and advice as I'm new to this system.

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
USDCAD is range bound..meaning it does not know what it wants to do. Weekly trend is down, but daily trend is up which confirms indecision. I would stay out of it unless it breaks hard to one side or the other. Remember that we do not have much time to trade today.

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
No problem.  We are all "always learning".  Put the period serpators in your charts, it really helps.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
hello lawgirl,

could you please tell me how do you determine weekly, daily, 4h trend direction. Could you post some example charts for us please?

I'm not seeing the same trend direction as you. Do you use any indicators which tells you the trend direction for weekly, daily and 4h or just by looking at the price? Please let me know.

thanks

viji

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
That's great! Small profits over and over again are what we are looking for.

--- 帖子 #1218 ---

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
I use a very simple RSI (3) indicator + PA.  I will try to post.

Look at these EURUSD charts...weekly, daily, H4.  Look at the RSI indicator.  You can see that the indicator does not confirm direction on these 3 TFs.  I prefer all three to confirm direction, but depending on PA may enter a trade anyway.  Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
Thanks. That really helps. I was looking at your previous posts for the past few weeks and I just noticed an indicator at the bottom (looks like RSI) of your charts but it says WOW:Long and sometimes WOW:Short. Is this a custom indicator you wrote yourself based on Rsi? Sorry to ask too many questions. I was just curious.

thanks

viji

--- 帖子 #1221 ---
You are very observant.  I have tried not to have that indicator showing, as I it is a custom RSI indicator that I paid someone for so it belongs to him, but I have forgotten to minimise it sometimes.  The RSI (3) that I posted is the same, except it does not say "long" or "short"

Reading the RSI, think of a clock face...pointing between 12:00 and 2:00 -- Long;   pointing between 4:00 and 6:00 -- Short.

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
Cheers, thanks lawgirl.

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
I'm curious where the one week rule comes from.  In the very first post on this thread, David shows three trades with the system.  Unless I'm misreading the charts in that post, in the first trade the third tap comes after a weekend has passed.  In the third trade (second trade, second chart) it looks like there is over two weeks between L1 and the third tap.

Was there some development I'm missing?  Please forgive me if there is an obvious answer to this concern.  I'm just trying to get a firm handle on the mechanics of this technique.

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
one of the rules i remember is the next tab must be more than 4 or 8 hours..it shouldnt be too close..

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
by the way anyone trading this fulltime, full income?

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
You will be soon!

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
Nobody is paying attention to this thread anymore.

Do what works.  Look at it....if it works ...do it.

Take the time to go through the charts and back test it.

It works...believe me.  don't get super hung up on rules.  three taps...if you are afraid to try it...just do the major trend lines....big long pretty trend lines.

--- 帖子 #1228 ---
Drvmarch asked a question about a possible trade setup.  Lawgirl answered that it did not follow the rules.  Drvmarch then thanked Lawgirl for educating him on the rules of this system.  That's all fine.  But I was curious about the one week rule, because it seems to have creeped into this system, and I can't figure out where.

It's clear that there was no such one week rule at the beginning of this thread.  Two out of the three examples that David gives to explain the system violate a one week rule.  But there also seems to be a clear sentiment that there should be a one week rule.  Lawgirl says so.  Moreover, Steve Hopwood seems to be incorporating it into his bot for this system.

So, I'm wondering where it came from and what was the basis for it.  If this thread is the wrong place to ask for details about David's Trendline 4H Scalping method, then please accept my apologies.

--- 帖子 #1229 ---
I have re-read the first 10 pages and you are so right..I can't find a reference to the week rule.  I don't know if that rule was relaxed, or if I made it up!  If I have confused or mislead anyone for saying this (more than once) I sincerely apologize.  It is a rule I follow for entering trades, but not for garnering overall trend, however, so I may have added it subconsciously to Dave's rules. Again, I apologize to Dave and anyone I may have confused.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
Hello lawgirl21, don't worry you are right, it is in the thread somewhere

--- 帖子 #1231 ---
hello duffypratt, see page 41 from post 606.

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
Re-reading the thread, I think its pretty easy to see how someone might think this was a rule.  It seems to have creeped in, I think as a kind of accepted misunderstanding.  And it's an interesting (at least to me) study in Internet "telephone."

As you noted, it was clearly not a rule at the beginning of the thread.  Comments 50, 74, 76, 77, 78, 81, 88, 133, and 139 all have set-ups that jump a weekend.  There are also a number of set-ups that jump weekends that David specifically confirmed:  those are on comments (31,35) (89,90) (139, 144).  On top of that, in comment 247, Dave showed a setup spanning from July 7 to July 20.  And the very first trade on the shared Neural Network spanned a weekend (comment 380).   It's very clear that there was no such rule at the outset.

Then, around comments 602-609, there was some confusion about a restart from the beginning of the week on the Neural Network.  David had just added extra pairs to the NN, and he restarted the system from scratch to avoid some confusion.  It looks like the restart of the automated system also occurred in subsequent weeks, but I'm not as sure about that.

In post 692, David comments that, as usual, there were no good trades in the early week.  He thought about taking a trade that had its set-up starting from the last week, but decided to give it a miss.  In post 843, Astral notes that with the Neural Network, nothing much happens during a week until maybe Wednesday or so.  These comments lead me to believe that the automated system, for convenience or technical reasons, limited its time frame to a weekly basis.  This would serve to cut down the number of valid trades, including eliminating many if not most of the set-ups shown in the very early pages of this thread.

At comment 890, John19 says that sticking to the current week is a rule. This is the first time anyone says that its a rule.  Precap2 questioned whether this was part of the original plan at 895.  But there was a minor bit of scuffling/flaming going on at that time, and no-one ever answered Precap2.  The next time the "rule" got mentioned was by you, and its now easy to see how this might develop.

Now here's a question for you, Lawgirl.  Around comment 1028, both you and Cugir321 took a trade based on this third tap idea.  The first leg of the trade looks to be on Aug 3, and the third tap was on Sept 6.  This was part of a chart where you got two trades, one from the bull line, and the other from the bear.  How does this trade square with your own rule?

By the way, I don't have any opinion about whether the one week rule is a good thing or not.  I'm just trying to understand what I've been reading and learn as much as I can from other people's experience.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
Thanks so much, DW.  I thought maybe I was losing it!  I feel much better.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
hello lawgirl21, happy to help. Like u and cugir321 do we can trade as david showed but as well not always to be blind from bigger trendlines briges and channels cos pips are pips

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
lawgirl, no need to apologise. you shared with us all a method that works for you and most importantly something that is very profitable. Its up to each individual traders to decide what they want to do.

I think lack of understanding and fear of losing makes a trader worry about the rules. Once they understand how this works then every trader will create their own rules. The method is trendline bounce and there are loads of chart with examples. That's what matters the most.

--- 帖子 #1236 ---

Wow! You have done a great job of analysing the thread posts. I looked back at that NZDUSD trade and my chart was the standard H4 chart with trading short on the 3 tap. I was trading bounces, or the triangle, or channel...whatever you want to call it. That is one of my favorite ways to trade.

I believe Cugir321 was posting the daily chart to show the long term trend confirmation with the H4 chart, but he probably entered from the H4 chart.

What's your average lot size on a trade? How many trades are you willing to keep open at once?  And what percentage of your account are you willing to risk on any single trade?  I'm always interested to hear how other people handle money management, and almost no one on this thread has addressed how much to risk on these trades.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
I am lucky enough to have a pretty large fund to start with. I take money off the board when I have accumulated $5K. I do not try to double my account...only to keep it and pull profits out of it. I tried "letting it ride" but found that it begin NOT to feel like "real" money and I got careless with it. I like to trade 2 full contracts. I don't like more than 2 open trades at a time, but will sometimes have 3..watched carefully. I have a high tolerance for risk. I won't share anything else about my money management.

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
I'm grateful for what you have shared and won't press further.  It's interesting to hear your reasons for not compounding your account.  Most people seem to have the opposite reaction to the accumulation of assets.  As the money grows, it becomes more and more real, and that leads to making mistakes, but out of an overabundance of caution rather than carelessness.

Watch tonight.

If it falls to the bottom line then it will probably be a nice long.

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
I saw that, but I'm not liking it.  Too late.  It was beautiful 4 candles ago.  Weekly, daily, and H4 in different directions.  I'm staying out for now.

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
Thanks for pointing this pair out.  Not one I normally look at.  All TFs are long.  I will probably watch PA awhile longer, then go in.

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
I just placed a pending buy order.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
I think E/Chf will do a quick drop in the next hour and then party up.  We'll see...

It seems a lot of pairs are consolidating.

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
U/CAD could be about to take a third tap....if you don't mind close taps it may be a short.

It just took the third tap.....as I type.  well within 1 pip....I'll wait...It's a trend line from that last big spike down.  Spike on the 17th.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
A/J

Any thoughts on this one....it broke thru the line....coming back???

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Looks like a good set up for a long to me.  On my watch list.

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
My chart looks slightly different.  Mine went through and is coming back up...

Just bought in at 80.40....long  A/J

Here's my 4 hr chart

My ECHF long trade just triggered.

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
I should have taken it. Oh well...

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
No, I should have waited my my 6:00p.m. candle change and watched PA a little longer.

UCAD is having trouble at the 1.0340 resistence level.

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
You mean for E/CHF???

I was talking about U/CAD....it went 20 pips already.

I'm not ready for E/CHF

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
i think nzdusd can go for a short soon

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Oh..you are in UCAD?..I'm waiting on that one.  I'm in ECHF....who's on first?

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
That one could be a while.

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
lol...

no I didn't take U/Cad...I was dreaming about a new Vette.  Missed it.

Not ready for E/CHF ...I want a solid hit down.

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
Hi lawgirl, just curious which broker are you using? my eurchf is still about 65pips before trigger.. my broker is +3gmt

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
I don't think she took the main line.  She's what we call a progressive.

i'm still kicking myself in the ass over U/CAD....everything looks so damn good on that chart.

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
Dun be angry. i missing all the action. Now at work!!!!!

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
The thing that scares me about E/CHF is that main trendline sitting below the price.  It's a ways off.  If it decides to fall you could go 85 pips.

that's the one I've been waiting for it to bop.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
so nzdusd is still on uptrend right? i thought its turning down... silly me.

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
on daily eurchf is still a downtrend so we should still take a short opportunity, am i right?

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
You mean you missed the usdcad couter trend trade?

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
I'm FXDD..+2

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
I think you are right..

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
Sorry....I misread..looks more like long to me.

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
Do your assessments after you get a third tap.

You don't want to go in until at least a third tap.  I believe Lawgirl went in off another secondary trendline.  I think she's probably up about 20 pips so God Bless her.  She can't lose now if she says...no minus or zero!!!

You need to use the main trend lines until you get a deeper understanding.  It won't take long.

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
I see that you are looking at the triangle..good. You could be right.  We need to check out the longer TF directions.  Weekly is not reliable on a Sunday night so I skip it and look to the monthly, daily and H4.

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
Longer TFs are long....so that is the bias right now.

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Am I missing something here?  NZD/ USD

This thing is sitting in the middle of a triangle.  It's gonna be a while before it hits either line.

I don't think I'd go for 50 pips if I took the trade.  Maybe 35 or so....

Yes it should be a short but it's gonna be a while before it hits for the third tap unless something happens like news.

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Bias is long.

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
Moved EURCHF to BE.

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
BE????  what's that?  Be enough?

NZD/USD  The bias is long for a bit....the two equal pointed tops on the daily and the lower highs seems to mean it's dropping after the tap...at least to me.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
"Be enough"   I love it!  I wish!  No, it means "break even"  which means I cannot lose money on the trade..I may not make money, but I can't lose it either.

Post your chart and let's look at it.

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
NZD/USD

I think he's right....I think after the 3rd tap on the top line it's going to fall for a bit.

Here's the daily....it looks like it's maxed up..see the two doji types or points at the dotted yellow line....it may go thru the triangle when it drops down.

There's a nice channel going down if your draw a bottom channel line.  I'd bet it's going through the triangle bottom.

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
We'll have to watch and see..but I'm not seeing a short trade here.

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
Thanks Cugirl for the "Cu" on audjpy now its 24pips profit.

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
actually it was 35 pips profit.  I'm out.  Don't lose all your profit.  Calculate 50 pips from the line and subtract where you got in.  Get out with some profit so you can start the week with a smile.  It went a total of 42 from the line.  Good enough.  Start with a win!  You need to feel like a winner!

Now look at everything I told you about on the 4hr and 1 hr chart and remember what a great long winner looks like.  Flip it over in your mind to see what a great short looks like.  Notice where everything is positioned.

Save the chart ....mark it up with verticle lines!!!!

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Yes i went it pretty late..thanks!

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
After you mark your chart with verticle lines....send it to me.  Tell me why you went in where you entered.  send it to my email.

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
lawgirl/cugir321,

I saw the charts both of you have posted on EUR/CHF, USD/CAD and NZD/USD. It was all brilliant. I like to participate but I was in bed (i'm from UK). Its amazing the asian sessions are giving so much steady movement unlike London session.

My EUR/CHF trades attached. I entered one before I went to bed and added another position when I woke up an hour ago. Red arrow pointing entry.

Keep up the good work and I will participate where I can. I'm going back to bed again.

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
I can't figure out your trades from the chart.  We pretty much use three taps and a few other indicators which we don't talk about much to preserve the thread.  And the trend on the 4hr, daily, weekly...I add the 1hr for quickies.

I'll say it....I add...the RSI(3) (thanks to lawgirl).  Be sure it's pointed in the direction of the trade.  The TDI.    Cross of green over red.  That's it!!!  (maybe a little 5,3,3 stoch like pepper)

If they're all pointed in the right direction...call the bank!!!  You'll be depositing.  You'll have to get a feel to decide how much!  The indicators, I believe, help with the secondary lines.  They tell you when to get rollin'...especially out.  Watch price action...make sure it confirms the other stuff.

The three taps on the trend line with the trend are the key.  The rest just verify's it for me.  I just set 50 pip stop loss and decide take profit on my own.

This three tap thing is soooo powerful!!!

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
I have had the same experience as Lawgirl21 using the Nanningbob system. As soon as my account is doubled, I get careless and lose my profits down to the original funded amount again.  The second time this happened I have changed my strategy to keep the original funded amount and then once a week/fortnight I withdraw the profits.  I us 3x $1K accounts with different brokers. I seem to have a much better Bank balance growth this way.

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
Sorry about the oanda charts. They are not that good. I pretty much trade trend trading, reversal, breakouts and range trading. Trendline bounce is one of the many methods I trade and the one that is most reliable in my opinion. So I trade pretty much like you and lawgirl but my MM differ from you two (i think).

Lets say for example: A trader trades 1 standard lot ($10 a pip) with a 50 pip S/L and 50 pip TP. That's $500 risk for $500 profit.

I trade differently. I break my standard lots into 2 or 4 lots (i.e. $2.50 a pip or $5.00 a pip) and always look for 1:2 Risk Reward ratio. So when I enter a trade I start with $2.50 a pip with 50 pip S/L and watch what is happening. If price goes against me I lose $125 instead of $500. So I still have $375 risk left to trade for the day. If trade goes my way I move to BE and enter another $2.50 in a suitable location and another and another.

So if one standard lot trader makes 50 pips in one trade. I make 80-100 pips in the same trade because I'm adding position on each retrace. The end result is I make same as 1 standard lot trader or even better. But when a trade goes against me I get 3 extra chances to trade compared to 1 standard lot trader. So even if I lose 3 trades of $2.50 each I can still end up in profit with one $2.50 trade. Because the moment I move my stop to BE I have that amount to risk to add a position or trade it again. This is absolutely essential for survival in forex. Also trading this way helps me to extract maximum out of a move which is essential.

In forex nothing is certain. Even if you wait patiently and do very detailed analysis and trade high probability setup...still it is not certain. Why lose your risk in one trade?

Hi Cugir321,

Thanks for your advice to include TDI...

On which time frame do you wait for the cross of green over red line? Are you using TF 1 hr other TF for this confirmation?

Thanks in advance....

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
I like the 1 hr (and less sometimes 15min) for entry but I monitor the 4 hr.  They have to show pretty much the same thing except the 4hr will be a bit behind.

I don't want to hijack the thread but I've found the system becomes almost bullet proof with these things.

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
Hi Cugirl,

have pm you on the audjpy setup to check  thanks

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
Anyone in this trade?

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
lawgirl21,

Not in the AJ but did take the NZDUSD in both directions based on the recent posts and worked out well.  Can I ask why you are in at this point since your buy is not at a touch point from the lines drawn (maybe you have other steeper lines)?  Or maybe you took it when the RSI turned favorable.  It looks to be working out well.

I continue to learn from the successful folks here.  Thanks.

Dave

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
I took that trade last night as a channel trade, but it did have 3 taps when I took it.  I am out of it now with +38 pips.

I also took the NZDUSD trade long last night because of the triangle.  Out of it now with +20 pips.

Both of those trades were "3 touch/tap" trades, but within a certain formation:  channel for one, triangle for the other.  Channel is one of my favorite ways to trade...bounce to one line, then the other..up and down or down and up..sometimes for days.

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
This is the other trade I took last night and am now out with +32 pips.  Wish I had stayed in longer.  This was a range bound trade that could not break through the resistence area (blue line).  We have been talking about this pair and setup since last Friday.

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
Took a little off nzd/usd this morning.  My problem is I have to use a cell phone at work....it's hard to go thru the pairs and draw the lines.   Anything close to a third tap that you folks can see?  Thanks in advance!

We should start a thread....call it "Almost 3rd tap".  Post just the ones within like 30 pips of hitting a third time.

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
Thanks... really appreciate it...

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
Do you actually count pips away from the lines?  I don't.

Look at USDCHF for potential long trade.  Triangle formed.  PA hit TL  at least 3 times.  COUNTERTREND trade though, so extra care should be given.

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
I do when I'm waiting for the third tap and I'm trying to share the info with you guys...a heads up coming.....that post was about sharing the info online.

I've been watching US/CAd...doesn't want to hit the bottom line of the triangle.

U/cad looks like u/chf.......nothing is bending up enough for me to enter.

thanks for the heads up.

--- 帖子 #1309 ---

I may take usd/jpy....

I'm looking at other indicators.

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
Took USD/SGD at 1.3338...things are bending down a bit on the lower TF's.  Plus the overall trend is down on the 4, d, w...

The triangle bottom is about 20 pips down...I'll take about 10 pips if it is so kind to give them.

I am sure along with me many others would be mising your posts.

Am trying to follow this strategy since the past one week. So the the breakdown of the server is the reason for the NN not working.....

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Can you hook me up to on your strategy? I am trying to choose between different methods but all so far seem not to work!

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
This strategy is about as clearly presented, and as simple, as they come.  A good start would be to start reading at Page one, post one and then continue.  Then, if you have specific suggestion, you should find people here more than helpful.

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
David, thanks for getting the NN up.  I tried it recently for the first time and it wasn't connecting.  Seems to work well now.  I appreciate all you've done with this strategy.  Thanks for sharing your wisdom and all your hard work.

Dave

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
No need to apologize sir. Welcome back you were missed. Whilst you were away cugir and lawgirl were keeping us entertained. They have now posting at 3 tap thread which is quite interesting also (a variation of your method). Looking forward to your posts

Hi David,

The 3rd touch is few pips away from TL on my chart. This should taken into considration as valid entry? Please advise.

The current sell entry of GY is based on other system which is under testing for the moment.

Thank you.

Sam

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
hey sam i got executed through a different liquidity feed. the price on my liquidty feed hit and executed wehre one my fxdd it was like 5 pips away

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
p.s +50pips on that trade.

well done to all that took it and got autoexecuited with the nnclient

--- 帖子 #1333 ---
Hi David, whcih broker did you use that have the 3rd tap hit?

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
Thanks David, it's working now. Either my computer was screwed up or I was, lol. REALLY looking forward to using the NN! Thanks for all your hard work on developing this!!

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
guys the 3rd touch was a few pips away from my broker aswell but because i was using the nn it auto executed. i got in at 70 and also made 50+ pips.

my understanding of dave's nn is it runs of a different price feed to that of main brokers like alpari fxdd etc.. dave has explained to me that he uses fxdd charts as they closely replicate his feed's prices.  so if you have autoexecute setup properly and the price hits on his feed and executes it will also execute on the nn.

i have been reading up and noticed that some people think that it analyzes their charts locally. this isnt the case.  its client/server based technology.  so the client connects to his nn server and displays trades.  when the trades are executed on the server everyone who is connected also gets executed(if you have autoexecute checked)

It will be great when the sms feature is added, i have been nagging him via skype to get it up and running but he has been busy the past few weeks.  well it is all free so no one can complain, i sure am not.  im up over 2kpips using his method + nnclient.   the method is transparent and the nnclient is for autoexecution so thanks again dave!

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
Just to clarify i am unable to setup the auto-execute trade unless theres a real trade that comes in.. but on my chart the price did not hit the 3rd tap i am therefore unable to set it up...

--- 帖子 #1337 ---
no. i dont think your getting the concept of client server setup.  no matter what your price is dave's nnserver has pricefeeds i think from bloomberg/reuters and other banks.  so if the price hits on his server who ever is connected regardless of what your chart says(the difference between your feed and his) it will execute.

--- 帖子 #1338 ---
hello david, i am tradeing this on other pairs, doing good and want to say big thank u for idea

--- 帖子 #1339 ---
Hi I am curious for broker feeds that doesn't touch the 3rd what do you normally do?do we just pass that trade?

I like this method...i will have to study it further. Personally, i think i may have to use the length of the signal candle as my entry(candle close) and SL; then, project the candle length further, use the 50% of that candle length projection as my BE point.

Also, perhaps, one can add some confluence to it: round number, s/r levels, fib levels(38 to 61).

Hi David,

I hit S/L 133.820 whereby the Hight of the time being stop out is 133.750 (13:00). It's 7pips away. Is FXDD have such huge spread for GY? This is normal or abnormal?

After get stop out the price is all the way down as now is 132.440 while am typing this!!!!!

Lucky it's just demo.

Hi guys!

I am a bit lost regarding the last GBPJPY trade that david and other members took two days ago.

In the chart I am attaching, I tried to find that trade (I marked the 133.36, the price at which david mentioned he went in the trade). I also put two other questions in the graph.

Thanks!

Hi, I have downloaded the ForexDave nn and under trade type there is nothing. Is that how it should be?

Edit: Ignore my question I just clicked ok and see a successful trade.

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
I don't think there is a pure perfect strategy for taking these trades.  Some do better than others.  When you trade the amplified pairs (anything ending with JPY), then the chances you get your 50 pips is more likely for a quick-in/out.

It just takes practice and an eye for price action showing trends.  I prefer EURJPY and GBPJPY personally, but EURUSD and AUD has some great smooth trends for a lot of pips.

The first trade you show is a possibility, but it is a long ways out and the general trend for the last bit had changed.  So.....

The 2nd trade looks right pretty much.  The 3rd trade is a possibility, but you are kind of working against the trend, but it is in the shape of a bull flag (large one, too big in my opinion) or a wedge, which both are bullish.

--- 帖子 #1369 ---

--- 帖子 #1370 ---
Thanks for your observations! They remind me that in this strategy, as well as with most of the discretionary trading, we can not take all the trades "literally by the rules"; instead, we should look first the setups that fit our rules and, after that, use our common sense (adquired with experience) to know if the trade makes sense or not with what is happening with the chart.

potential gbp trade coming up depends on the close of this candle will know in 30 mins

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
sorry david, iam new.

is your method still working and profitable ? where can i get the latest updates on it from ?

also, is your method not the same thing as the 3 touch trendline bounce theory ? i.e. if it touches the trend line 3 times then that confirms the trend ?

on the first page your first post , you attached 2 screen shots. the first one is a buy, you bought after the price touched the trend line 3 times and bounced. however, was it not too late to enter a buy trade then as the up trend was too far and on its way to loosing steam ? and indeed shortly after it came down sharply.

can you please post charts with where / when you would enter and why ?

on the upside there are 3 touches, so we go for a buy right ?

i wish david486 would answer some of these questions considering he is the man in the know. he never answers any questions directed at him, which i find a bit annoying to say the least. what is the point of starting a thread if you dont wanna communicate with people and help people understand your system ??  you may as well close down the thread and trade on your own.

the gbp/jpy first leg starts at 131.90 and the second 132.14

if the price hits on any candle after these legs on the trend drawn from 131.90 to 132.14 then you buy.  take into account news announcements etc(you do not enter 1 hour or before a economic announcement)

it cant get any simpler than this.  i have been with this thread since it has started and dave has kindly written the nnclient especially for forex factory.  So please keep your demands to your self, i personally dont want him to pack up shop.

and to describe the nnclient its a application which displays the trades hes currently waiting for.  you also have an option to autoexecute on your broker if you wish to follow his exact trades.   try watching the video.

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
hello whatfx, is easy, here is chart for u. Look nn and L1 is 1st point of line, L2 is next, wait 3rd to enter. Enter candle close or tap or blind or wait news or big trend against trend is for u to think. Like david say all is here on thread if u read back. david enter on 3rd tap. Do same for au and u will see.

hello john19r, u do say it better and faster than me

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
and dave im in the gy trade. i was autoexecuted by the nnclient.

in at 132.21

--- 帖子 #1391 ---
sorry, but is this the audusd 2 taps by nn client/
http://www.bigdaypictures.com.sg/audusdtrade.jpg

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
yes and on the third tap you buy!!

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
Hallelujah! I see the light!

--- 帖子 #1394 ---
you do !?  ok. but the 3rd tap could take hours if not days to occur, right ? also, how do you determine how far to look back to determine the trend and number of touches ?

regards

--- 帖子 #1395 ---
This is not my "home" on ff but i like to follow up on this thread anyhow, as this type of trading is right up my alley. But have you even read through the thread? I think not cause then you would have no need to ask that question. The least you can do as a sign of respect to the thread starter is to go through and actually read through it, and grasp what its all about. Should really be self explanatory.

Either way have a good one

--- 帖子 #1396 ---
Thanks David for this amazing system, still learning

--- 帖子 #1397 ---
Hello guys.....good to see the pips in ur favour....

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
Hit TP for 50pips! Great initiation! Happy I got in late, hope it keeps going up for those in at right price

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
Anyone in AUD yet?

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
hello david, watching uc?

--- 帖子 #1403 ---

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
It seems to be against the major trend

--- 帖子 #1405 ---
I am going to wait and hope it drops back just a little as target is near to days's high.

--- 帖子 #1406 ---

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
How abt GU buy set up?

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
guys who ever took the aud trade well done. it was almost to the pip on the long call, as for the gy im in 1/2 of my position still closed the other half at 50

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
hello david, +80pips today for both nn trade thx

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
I love you David!

--- 帖子 #1411 ---
nice work on the 80+pips

i got out with 60+

awesome, autoexecution worked flawlessly.

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
Hi John, how do we get autoexecution for more than 1 trade?

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
check the boxes in the nnclient then select the autoexecute and setup

watch the video it works of mouse clicks if your not aware

--- 帖子 #1414 ---
Yes I understand it works on mouse clicks but how it command 2 different clicks for the pair? There's no way to keep the order window open for 2 pairs...

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
most brokers you can keep 2 different order windows open at the same time. what broker are you using

--- 帖子 #1416 ---
hello david, only passed YES trades for nn today is right?

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
I am using fxdd

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
can someone who uses fxdd to trade and not just for charts help juzgood out. seems he cant open more than one order window at a time. mt4 based broker..

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
new gy trade, shot sell see nn for details

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
Hi. I believe MT4 only allows one order window at time. I am using two brokers MT4 and they're both the same.

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
Hi David

nn does not show any new trades

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
Yes i am seeing a GY trade.... ready to catch some pips

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
try not to hold over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
Tnx.

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
but you wait the close candle's for entry ?

or you entry on trendline point  ?

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
Howdy!  I've done/looked at trades very close to using this.  I'm always amazed at how perfect the touches are to my lines at times when you'd think as a laymen that it should be a range and not a touch.

However, most of the time I do all of these charts, but I'm not at the computer for that precise moment to take the trade.  Do you all have software or brokers where you perform a buy/sell automatically, or are these trades all manual?  My issue always seemed to be an issue of being around.  Unless the line is a straight horizontal support/resistance.

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
You may use the NN by David or the EA's by Steve.

I do appreciate the patience of David particularly when he is expected to answer the basic questions again and again, particularly the ones which are there on the 1st post of the thread!

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Hey all,

I've been reading the thread and found it very fresh, especially for a method that is based on diagonal TL only.

Also, good on capitalizing on relatively small take profits. That way you don't need the market to fully reverse, sometimes a temporary reaction to a level will take you to your TP.

Congrats on the system!

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
apologies for the slowness of the week guys i havnt been trading. i will be setting up a mirc chat server for everyone short6ly

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
Its quite alright David, Mondays are slow anyhow but coupled with holiday in the US it was slower than usual. Most grateful for your efforts.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
a couple of ppl have asked me why the thread has been quiet this week. to tell you the truth the volatility has kept me out of the market.  i traded of parity on the aud/usd for 100 pips(entered last week exited this week) great trade. will be looking at shorting the aud again off parity.   this of course has nothing to do with my method only something i consider to be a good resistance for the au.

as for the usual trends hopefully next week will show something good

--- 帖子 #1441 ---
Hi David,

happy to hear you again and congrat for the aud/usd trade .

Maybe I missed something but I'm no more able to connect using your NN client. I thought you were updating it to allow the SMS function, could you please tell me how is going this project?

Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
everyone is getting the same message. its his server its offline for maintenance

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
Hi John,

thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #1444 ---
anyone else going to trade parity bounce like dave on the aud?

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
Sure, I got 240 pips out of the last one.  One more bounce is possible...

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
guys just to let you know my aud/usd parity trade is closed for a total of 24 pips. i shorted roughly 3mil hence the small pip count. i may look at re-entering.  my entry was 1 flat and exit was 76.

as for my server and the reason why it has been down, someone compromised it.  it was hacked into and some of my code was stolen.  that being said the code is useless without the other modules.  that being said it has demotivated me in regards to this thread but i will still make posts whether or not i put the server back up is another thing.   hope all is well and all are making money

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Sorry to hear about that man! Someone hacking in to the server is really screwed up. You've given a great contribution to  the community with this thread here and iv definitely picked up some real value from you, so I and im sure others as well really appreciate your efforts

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
David, what you have contributed is tremendous and hacking your server is a malicious act...  We hope you can get your server organize so you can continue to trade how u use to. As for the thread I respect whatever decision you have taken... All the best!!

--- 帖子 #1449 ---
This is great method, simple and stright forward. I am using it a lot. Just leting the trades run as long as posible.

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
Good to know. What are the stats about? Any results real money?

Thanks

Forex37

--- 帖子 #1451 ---
Well, I don`t count any statistics. You probably know that the method is only let`s say 30 persent of the sucses. But I realy don`t do anything special. Just some discretion. The steeper the trendline the more likely it will get broken instead of a bounce from it. Also if price haven`t made new highs or lows and coming back to test the trendline I will be more suspicious that it holds. I use sl of 100 atr on 4H TF(60 period). But if the candle break the trendline and the sl is not hit yet I more likely will close the trade. I almost alwais move sl to be when price in my favor the amount I risk, but the more I don`t like the price action the faster I do it. And for sure I like to let the profits run if the trade is in the long term direction. Yes I get stoped out more times then I cash in the big profits, but it pays off. Sinserly I trade this only for a few months, but it doesnt mean that it is too early to say it works, because there are many methods that works if combined with good money management, right mind set, patience, not overtrading and similar things. Btw if I do not trade the bounce I may trade the break. And here it is clear,-the more steeper the trendline the more likely it will get broken. I use closed candles for breaks.

--- 帖子 #1452 ---
I would not engage in scalping on the yen. This is the most speculative currency. According  to the scheme provided by you, the best deal on the European pairs, and  only if they do not demonstrate complete dependence on changes in the  euro dollar. And I just pips on the euro dollar (U.S.)

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
This is my EU analysis.Currently price is resting on TL waitng for the BO.

--- 帖子 #1454 ---
Hi Chris, So do you have good luck with the 3 consecutive tap approach? And if so, do have guidelines? Seems like the most successful models of Dave's approach have a true ABCD config, and on a not too steep TL, as Siber discovered. I got creamed papering '3 in a row' on multiple TF's.

Thanks

P

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
hi, guys,

what happened here? everybody left?

is that still a valid method to trade???

--- 帖子 #1456 ---
Hi,

i want to ask, do we need to wait until price really touch trendline?

how to face this condition on GU H4? price almost reach trendline but not yet (small arrow).

http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/308/guh1.gif

maybe we should place BUY LIMIT on trendline? or maybe we can BUY now?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
ANYBODY still trading this method? or everybody now on the NN?

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
eur/usd

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
move to B/E.

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
1st price target reached:  +37 pips.

2nd target = adr.

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
ADR of 100pips = 1.4060 for eur/usd. I LIKE 90% of daily adr for TP = 1.4070.

which makes +80 pips for me. entry was at 1.4150, sl = -19pips.= 1.4169.

1st pt = +37pips at 1.4112. 2nd pt = +80 pips.  CHART ATTACHED:

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
Why does a thread like this end and much lesser threads continue?

I have been trading very similarly to this for a quite a while now for 4-5 months and have found it very profitable. Never has a system offered me such great risk reward potential. I trade the 1 hour and look to catch the third tap of the trendline but with a tighter stop. If a trendline is going to be respected then there's no need for a large stop. 15 pips or so is fine.

Anyone looking to trade like this, i've learned to only trade the outer trendline. It might mean you miss some trades but it definitely keeps you out of bad trades more often than not.

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Thanks Gareth.  Why not breathe new life into the thread as it looks interesting.  How many pairs do you trade and how many opportunities do you see daily?  Subscribed.

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
I trade 13 pairs, basically any pair I consider to move normally with a low enough spread to trade them on the 1 hour chart.

Attached are just 3 pairs for today.

1st chart gbpusd (trendline drawn from 4 hour chart hence why it doesn't match the 1 hr low exactly)

2nd chart nzdusd

3rd chart usdcad

With a tight 10-15 pip stop 4:1 would have been so easy to achieve. I've switched from looking for a system with high win rate, to looking for a system with high risk reward. I'm hoping i've managed to find both.

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Thanks Gareth, I will start drawing TLs over the weekend and give it a try next week on the 1 hour charts.  Do you ever place pending orders or do you check the charts every hour?  Also, do you wait for the third touch candle to close after the bounce before you enter as confirmation?  Thanks again and have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
Great way to start the week, missed entry by a pip!

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
What do you mean by the 'outer' trendline?

I have been experimenting with this method as well, with moderate success. I did about 30 trades, and maybe I just had a bad batch, but I there were not many trades that even went to test the last swing high, and I was only buying the 3rd touch of the trendline.

I'm buying with a limit order right on the trendline on the 3rd touch, and using a tight stop; but I'm trying to figure out some other filter to keep me out of my bad trades. I'm wondering if maybe I should only be buying if we are near to one of my MA for example (I usually use 20 and 60 SMAs.).

If anyone else has any ideas on some way to filter out additional bad trades I would like to hear it, and also what seem to be the best targets? Like I said, I was not having much luck with price even making it up to the last swing high (for longs), so targeting that wasn't working and I was not getting many trades at 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 Reward/Risk. But maybe I was just on an unlucky streak.

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
Gareth, TP you put on a level?

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
It's entered off the minor round number, it's also at the 0.618 retracement of the move down (I only bother with 0.618 retracements). It's been hit a few times so lets see, I'm at breakeven so I don't particularly mind.

Sometimes I look at lower timeframes for confirmation if i'm at my computer and there was a good 5 minute pin bar rejecting it (or at least the minor level..)

In hindsight the trendline would have been better connecting the previous major high but in hindsight everything looks better and you can match everything perfectly, this is what I saw so this is what I traded when the chart was blank to the right...

--- 帖子 #1470 ---
Its not easy to sell when the chart has been going up with no confirmation, but i'ts the only way i've found to have a method with a decent chance of hitting 3:1.

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
Another trade as per my rules, it might not work but I don't expect them all to. That's my winners are generally 3:1.

Off the 140.000 level so gives some confluence to the trade.

Will stop trading for the day after this one..

Just to add that I trade the 1 hour charts..

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
Decided to close it at 2:1, so adding the usdcad and 2 audusd trades (one worked and one didnt) means I had another good day.

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
Not bad for monday

--- 帖子 #1474 ---
High win rate? Would that be the old Jankone thread on 5 and 15 minutes ? It still works well for a patient trader albeit maybe less pips per trade. than your 4hour/One hourly approach.

--- 帖子 #1475 ---
The 5min Ryanmcd method is still my go to method, I just find it interesting searching for alternative ways of trading. The 1 hour method doesn't really take up too much time and I like the high r:r aspect. I wish Ryan would come back and post. He was one of not many I trusted on here and I have no doubt that he's still trading the eurusd exactly as he taught here, seeing if it's making higher highs etc and trust trading dips in the trend...

Out of interest, how do you trade turnip? I often come across you on threads similar to what I like as well...

EDIT: I just looked at your profile and saw how you trade, no worries in explaining it here...

--- 帖子 #1476 ---
it is really great knowdledge.

hope it will continue.

it is also can be use in Daily TF?

thankQ
