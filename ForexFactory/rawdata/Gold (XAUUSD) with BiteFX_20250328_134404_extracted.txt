Advice : read everything you can on trading the forex market until you find what works best for you. Here ... H1 is the timeframe. 23 is the value for all indicator(s) parameter used. Primary Market Structure used is CHOCH. “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Matthew 7:7-8

Attached Image (click to enlarge) When market is making HH in an uptrend, the five candles inside the blue box above is what forms our sell CHOCH. And vice versa.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Sometimes they can be less or more than five. We trade limit orders only. With specific or mental SL.

Excellent method - it gives very good results I am impressed

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Thank you too much for your kind words. I am glad I am able to help someone make some extra money trading.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Some say resistance, others say supply zone, some more say order block. S$ LO taken first, let's wait for market to play out the probability.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Please explain the CHOCH in more details. Thank you

--- 帖子 #13 ---
CHOCH is change of character. I use one H1 TF candle to represent bullish movement and bearish movement respectively. Say Blue and Red. Find a set up like that image I shared on your H1 TF chart. Next, plot a horizontal line at it's close (the bearish close). Drop down to 30m chart, extend the line to the lowest close of the two 30mins candles inside the H1 bear candle in your set up. This is BOS(Break of Structure). When another bear candle closes below that BOS bear/red close, you have your CHOCH. If there is a bearish divergence supporting the CHOCH and a break below our Ichimoku up cloud set up, we have a sell reversal day.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
These closes are also known as liquidity/stop hunt levels.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Those are the levels where you are likely to put your SLs when you are buying. The blue candles on the left and right of those red candles makes the formation our typical BOS. If you drop down to lower TFs you will see for yourself. Now, when a bear candle closes below any of these closes, it is our typical CHOCH here.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
We have bearish CHOCH from BOS at 2933.35 and 2931.05 respectively. 2934.90 is bullish CHOCH. Telling us that market will make new ATH again. But wait for sell to finish up what it started. Let's see what confirmations the cloud and momentum will give.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Other indis show signs of potential sell reversal. We are waiting for cloud.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
If market continues up, we will find an entry point, and join the movement.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
how much your aim price higher last in your technical ? i see now gold moving very fast

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I am expecting a sell reversal from that high. So the current highest high on the chart is my SL. If that is breached, then I will find a buy entry position.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
A sell from 2939. IS it something you see technically or because you expect profit booking at that level. How to recognise a trend reversal different from the small correction ?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Technically. Trend is up I know. And either way, I am positioned to make money. The fall of last Friday how big was the correction that led to the fall? Once I see the parameters for an entry, I set the trade and forget about it. Now, the market is showing more upward move. I am to join up. This is about focusing on the parameters set for entry and exit. Do you get?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
A significant high is broken, it will retest and continue higher. Basic market structure.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Basic market structure of CHOCH signals reversal. And we do it the way explained earlier on the thread.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Upward movement is set to continue... We have joined.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Valid sell Reversal... Buy continuation hit SL already.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
This already looking like last week Friday's drop. But a very wicked drop it is I presume.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
If bears are really serious, they may visit 2877 again.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
At the momentwhen you see the uptrend do you close the downtrend positions you hold?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
The way I do it is... 1. When I am expecting buy reversal but entered a sell, I will quickly close the sell position and join the buy. 2. If I was expecting a buy reversal and I have entered when a sell started, I will leave SL to decide the trade fate.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I am so expecting this fall... All parameters set.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The levels below are TP considerations... I like to ride winners. I have trained my mind to do that.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Other parameters you may want to explore are... 1, 1, 23... 0, 0, 23. Just backtest and let's see what you find. Nothing magical about 23. It's just that H1 TF trades 23 candles everyday.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
S$ continuation 2924.46

--- 帖子 #35 ---
We are waiting for SL or TP...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
This is a wide choppy market...market is still going back to 2935.77 again.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
In a choppy market, trend following strategy surfer losses... But will profit more during trending market. So, no headaches at all.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Some years ago here on FF, I saw a guy who said his boss scolded him for selling gold. That, they only have one strategy... Buy gold! Later I got to understand the basic ideology behind that strategy... Gold never losses value. But you and I retail traders don't know how deep a correction or retracement can be. So SL is very important to protecting your capital. Me, I buy and sell on my set up. Period!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Please, disclaimer! I don't sell programs, systems or anything to anybody. I just trade. I learnt to and I trade to make money. Stay humble, horn your system until you are "there". There, meaning where you are comfortable trading that your system with confidence, discipline and a winning attitude.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
2944.20 is still our level... Refused to buy yesterday inside the up cloud. We will watch it closely as it is the end of the inverse head and shoulders pattern that has formed on our H1 TF now.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
What does this mean ?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I put all those on my chart. That is, I have four Ichimoku indi on my H1 TF with those parameters. This post shows how it looks like. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post15156390

B$ 2940.04

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The closing price of candles are very important.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Bite fx when I use support and resistance in my chart i confused on that and I loss my trade at the end than some Month ago I don't use tecnical in my chart I use to find the trend and trade the candle pattern and it's very profitable for me

--- 帖子 #54 ---
With this system, I just debunked the whole HH, HL, LL, LH market structure for you. Use one bull candle as High and one bear candle as low. Then permutate the price movement. You will be amazed. In fact, I find it more interesting on H1 TF.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Market is here again today. Let's see if the bulls got balls.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Ok, now we are not expected to pick tops. As we are expecting a new ATH. Gonna be pretty high because of the set up I estimate.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I estimate more increase in price based on textbook charting technique. If a significant high or low is broken, it will retest and continue higher or lower.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Nothing special or mystical about the colors of my Ichimoku either. Just grey and yellow, to enable me see the candles properly. As Steve Nison once quoted the Japanese proverb in his book... "Candles exhaust themselves to give men light".

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Let's do a little imagination game... Imagine 1. When you started trading newly all the accounts you blew because you felt the market will leave you behind. 2. The trades you entered at very low prices four or five years back but closed because you felt the market may go against you any moment. Which is very true in some instances not all the time. 3. If those trades were held, those which didn't later get back to your protective SL, How much worth of Gold do you think you would have had by now?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
These were some of the thoughts that led to my search for a trend following strategy that is suitable to my personality and then I built it into tradable system for me.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Practicing delayed gratification which in turn reduces the dopamine effect of short term wins and the euphoria of short term loses. At this point, you become one with the market.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Question? When you close your winning trade because you feel it has reached TP, what will you be sitting down doing then? Instead, allow your winners to run for as high as they can. That is the way I learnt to trade profitably by the books. But this system requires trusting that a trend once started will continue until the end. The end is a CHOCH. Simple!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
We can quickly close a loosing trade but we can't hold the a winning trade because the profit triggers greed and what ifs situations in your mind. I have learned it over the past several months of my trading to keep your TP in mind and move your SL. Made a huge mistake last month in my trading. Lost lots of my capital and trying to rebuild back now. I used to keep an close eye on your analysis on that Gold forum but then you disappeared. Glad you make it back here. I would really like to have a healthy trading conversation with you if we can connect and if you are comfortable. Been a very harsh two months for me. Lots of learning and book reading took place. I loved the TRADINGI N THE ZONE. Felt like the whole book was about me hahahaha. Lack of confidence i am having these days and my entries are getting shit

I'm glad you created a topic... Show your perspective on TP and loss as well.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Observe that I did not even make mention of news event for once. This is because price movement on the chart will tell you everything about the news event. More than that, they said, buy the rumor and sell the news. How do you determine the rumor different from the news? What I am showing here is just simple common sense trading and faith in the trend that we see on the chart. Simple enough.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for creating new thread. less noise and clear vision

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I like your ideas and it syncs with my trade lot size as well Buy 2950 tp 2974 sl 2946 (2929 just if need to be more caution)

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Starting from the image you quoted... SL placement is the lowest price of the two bullish candles to the left of the bear candle we entered at. TP, we trail until we see CHOCH as explained here and a break below up cloud. Reverse this explanation for Sell movement also.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I'm glad you are already baptised here.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Yeah, SL is my only caution. Another thing I do is if original or initial SL not protective SL is hit twice in a cloud, I won't trade that cloud signal again.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thank you for your kind words chief. I'm a Nigerian. From Southwest zone. I dislike disrespect and look down with passion. So I had to do my thing separate from negative energies. I will PM you. I don't sell programs or systems. But, we will be glad trading together.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Happy to have a chat with you brother. I also don't like disrespect and leg pulling. Everyone is a learner till he/ she die. And if the respect is no longer being served that table is not worth it. Excellent decision of making your own thread and reuniting with people who actually admire your work. I am not in favor of people selling programs and systems hahahaha. I believe do good and good will come back at you. I want to seek guidance from you. Want to minimize my trading errors and discuss the methods that i use to trade. I am always down for learning and striving for excellence. BTW i am a car geek if you ever run into any sort of issues with your car you can let me know I won't let you down with the car stuff ahha

My story too similar . Good thoughts put into words

--- 帖子 #80 ---
How do you define SL and TP , what gives one that direction?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I believe the system adopted for entry will show where the signal is wrong if price hits it. TP is knowledge specific.

Up cloud is back... We are looking to B$ In days like this, proper money management will be very helpful.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Some will say ohhhhhhh! I should have done this, I should have done that. Come on now! This system is a robust trading system. We hold trades until market takes us out. Sone used to scalp the signal, they are not trading the full system. So again, we are patient for another entry.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
2935.14 sell is the scenario where I had to take my loss quickly because it failed to continue selling and then up cloud showed up at that low. Now, I have again trusted that the buy will continue at 2940.17. The previous up cloud gave us at 2940.04 BOS. So, let's see.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I wouldnt use ichimoku cloud without a number of other tools and assessments to make a trade. On its own, it isnt the most reliable. Me personally, I'm a swing trader and would keep positions open for days / weeks. I'm now in a risky sell position because not enough confirmation we're potentially in a trend reversal

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Please elucidate your other tools and assessment. Thanks. For me, kindly revisit first page, you will see the idea. I guess you may have never seen or heard of such Ichimoku parameters before. It is a banger for sure chief. Choppy market respects no one. Please, I await your other tools and assessment. Other guys here will also want to know.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Ok. The over all probability of this system is a win in trailing your winners in a trending market. According to Mark Douglas, you have to take all the signals of your system because, all the signals are independent of previous signals and performance. So, money management helps you survive losing streak or bad clusters of your system's probability. Which will certainly happen. I advice you divide your equity by 100000. The answer is your lot size. If you want to enjoy this system. Don't over load any single signal.

Can you please explain the basic market structure behind the EA? Is it a trend continuation or reversal, range bound market strategy? And if it is for sell, this is the wrong place to post such. Thanks Chief. One love.

Hello Bite, I hope you are doing well. 1st Thanks for sharing this strategy with us, it seems good one. 2nd I'm little confused because i coudn't make the parameters as 1,0,23 it forces me to set it as 1 this is the minimum digit i can't set the parameters as 0. Thanks

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Yes, I have the same problem.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Mt4/ mt5 can set minimum zero(0) on phone, but PC will not. The recent two screens I shared are... First screen: for easily detecting CHOCH A. 1, 0, 1 Second screen has: For easily following trend and trading BOS A. 0 ,0, 23 B. 1, 1, 23 C. 1, 0, 23 D. 0, 1, 23 E. 1, 1, 1

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Another challenge again is, when you set the parameters, you will have to input zero again if you enter Ichimoku indicator again. As many times you enter the indicator, you will input zero any where you initially input zero.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
On my honor chief.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
We know exactly where our stop loss is with this strategy. But we don't know exactly where our take profit is. Because when we Probably catch a strong moving trend, all our initial small losses during a choppy market would be covered by the profitable move. And ride the trend for as long as it lasts. This is a trend following strategy, not a ranging or wide sideways market strategy.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Try this chief https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...4#post15159564

--- 帖子 #147 ---
The system follows the simple advice from Steve Nison enshrined in this image during one of his lectures on trading. - Candlesticks charting is candlesticks on the chart for BOS and CHOCH . - Western charting is rhe use of indicators. - Money management is ability to calculate lot size and position sizing and all of the money management stuff you do.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I'm So sorry i'm disturbing you too much, i'm really intersted in your strategy. But i've tried in MT4 / MT4 on phone same issue i can't make it 0 minimum is 1.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
When you put the value zero, it will be there when you save. But if you enter Ichimoku again, where you put zero initially will revert to the default value. Do you understand?
