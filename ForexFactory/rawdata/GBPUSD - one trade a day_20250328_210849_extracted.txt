Tons of chart time on this pair has revealed an interesting possibility. I'll be formally testing this theory in a demo account, beginning tomorrow. The "system" couldn't be simpler. The money management takes a little more thought, so I will explain it first. We are taking ONE trade per day (which will be described later) on G/U. We will ALWAYS set a 20-pip stop loss, and that 20-pips will ALWAYS represent 2.5% of our balance. This is important to remember. Our goal for the month is 10% return on our opening balance. How we determine our TP for each trade is calculated from this. We will always set our TP so that, if TP is hit, it closes our month with a 10% gain. The first day of the month is simple, we risk 2.5% and want to gain 10%, so our risk:reward is 1:4. 20 pips risk * 4 = 80 pips reward. TP is therefore 80 pips for the first trade of the month. If we have a 3% winner the first day, we have 7% left to go for the month. The next day, we are risking 2.5% and want to gain 7%. Risk:Reward for this trade is 1:2.8. We always risk 20 pips, so our TP is set at 20*2.8, or 56 pips. Second day, we lose 2.5%. Now we have 9.5% left to go for the month. The next day, we're risking 2.5% to get 9.5%. 1:3.8 risk:reward. 20 pip risk * 3.8 reward means a TP of 76. Hopefully the math is clear. I've simplified it a bit - the examples above do not take in to account daily compounding or spread. I have a spreadsheet that does the math for me, and these factors are considered when it calculates this. But, the concept may be challenging enough for some folks that I wanted it to be as simple as possible without losing anyone. I will post results daily, which should help you understand the math once you see it a few times. On to the actual system. As I said, it couldn't be simpler, and it is something that I've discovered while spending hours pouring through G/U charts... At the open of the 08:00GMT hourly candle, look back to the 00:00GMT hourly open price. If the 08:00GMT open price is lower than the 00:00GMT open price, we GO LONG. If the 08:00GMT open price is higher than the 00:00GMT open price, we GO SHORT. SL is ALWAYS 20 pips. TP is calculated as described above. If neither TP or SL have been hit, CLOSE THE TRADE at the open of the 09:00GMT candle. Whether winning or losing, close the trade. That's it. Each day, figure out your TP based on how far you are from the monthly target, wait for the 08:00GMT candle, enter based on the rules above, and set your 20-pip SL and TP that you calculated. Close the trade if it is still open at 09:00GMT. Once you've hit the 10% target for the month, no more trades for the month. Set a goal, stick to it, and don't over trade. For Clarity... I would NOT expect this system to work without the money management. If you take it upon yourself to backtest this, simply counting pips by looking at the 08:00GMT candle every day will probably not produce anything exciting. The key to whether or not this system will prove worthy is the high risk:reward. This is not a "how many pips can I make" system. This is a system with a pre-defined monthly target, and a money management strategy designed to help have the best chance to reach that target. I will NOT provide "support" on this thread for how to figure out which candle is the 08:00GMT candle. If your broker is on GMT time, you have nothing to figure out. If you broker isn't on GMT time, do a search to determine how to calculate GMT based on your broker's time. ======================= UPDATE: 25-Feb-11 ======================= In the 6-weeks or so that this thread has been open, not much has changed. Several concepts have been discussed - outlined below. Keep in mind, these are not "rules" per se. These are things that people observed, that you may choose to incorporate (or not) in to your trading of this system: The "9-pip" rule. Some folks have found during testing that if the distance between the 00:00 and 08:00 candle is less than 9-pips, losing trades significantly outnumber winners. My testing has shown this as well, and so beginning from March 1st, I will be incorporating this rule in to MY trading. I will not take trades where less than 9-pips separates the 00:00 and 08:00 open prices. Use the 01:00 GMT candle instead of 00:00 GMT. One member has done extensive testing substituting the 1:00 candle to compare the 08:00 to, and reports that his results were better. Proportionally modify the risk:reward to suit your taste. This system will have losers. In some months, there will be a lot of them. At 2.5% risked per trade, this can add up. If you want to control risk, reduce your risk (and reward proportionally). Consider risking only 1% per trade, with a 4% monthly target instead of 10%. Or 0.5% risk per trade with a 2% monthly target. Maintain a 1:4 ratio. Don't stop at 10%. Some members have reported in their backests, continuing on past 10% gains in winning months has proven to be better long-term. Alternatively, when you hit 10% for the month, instead of stopping, simply "reset" to 0, adjust your position size, and start working toward 10% again. How to handle the "last" trade of the month when you are near the 10% target... It probably doesn't make a lot of sense to risk 20-pips if you are only a few pips away from the monthly target. Some options - (a) set your target for the day at 20, to make the trade 1:1 risk:reward. (b) don't trade, close your month a little short of 10% - it's still a great month if you're that close. (c) don't set any TP, and take whatever you can get. If you go over 10% for the month, great! Holidays - some folks have suggested not trading on UK holidays due to low anticipated volume. When I re-read the thread, I will add anything here that I may have missed. I think this covers the bulk of the discussions. At least one EA has been created and posted in a separate thread. You will find links to them within this thread. DO NOT post, ask for support for, or request any EAs in this thread. If you want to create and share your own EA, create a new thread for it. I will remove the ability for anyone to post further in this thread if they post an EA, request one be created, or ask for help with one that was posted elsewhere. The only reason for this is to keep the thread from becoming flooded with "EA help" or "can you add/change this" posts. I have nothing against EAs (I use one to trade this myself), and have absolutely no objection to anyone creating one and posting it in a separate thread . **EDIT - removed the myfxbook link again. OANDA 's MT4 demo is a mess... Finally, I hope you are able to take this concept and develop a plan with it that works for you. This is a system that leaves nothing to interpretation. You don't need to confirm if a line has crossed, if a half-dozen indicators across 4 time frames all match up, or if something repainted or turned a shade of green you've never seen before leaving you wondering if you should have entered or not. Entries and exits are perfectly clear. The "rules" are nothing more than guidelines. If you have a thought on how to make it work better for you, by all means, try it out and see. Take this and make it your own. My results below are using the followung rules: 2.5% risked per trade (20-pip SL), 10% monthly target, don't trade when there is less than 9-pips difference between 00:00 and 08:00, 20 pip TP target when less than 20-pips away from 10% monthly goal (no trade less than 1:1 risk:reward), and trade every day (no skipping holidays). ============================ Results ============================ The results below are from forward-testing in demo, beginning January, 2011. I will make an effort keep this section up to date. January, 2011: +10% plus an additional +6% * February, 2011: -0.35% March, 2011: -19.19% April, 2011: +0.83% May, 2011: -1.50% (through 13-May) *in January, the 10% target had been hit before this thread was opened. We started from 0 on 12-January, and were up 6% from that point at the end of the month.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Tomorrow will be the first day of our trading month. The demo is starting with a balance of $3000. Our monthly target is $300 (10%). We have 10% to go for the month and are risking 2.5%, so therefore our risk:reward is 1:4. Tomorrow's trade will have an 80-pip TP. Every trade will have a 20-pip SL. I'll be posting the results sometime tomorrow morning.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
What about a back test? Even a manual one should be pretty easy to do.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yep, I've done a manual backtest. Looked good enough to me at least to forward test, which is why I started this thread to track it. Wouldn't have gone through the trouble if it didn't look like it had potential. Feel free to do your own backtest, if you agree, subscribe. If you don't, there are plenty of other systems to explore, pick one that best suits your taste.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
So what were your results?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Good enough to start a thread and dedicate an account to explore. Only you can decide if it's worth your time.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
If you loose your first trade, which is a %2.5 loss, does this mean the target for your next trade will be %10+%2.5= %12.5? Thank you

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes - the target is always what is left for the month. And that's a good point.... The first few trading days of the month, the TP is not likely to be hit. Often times, I found the SL isn't hit either, so the trades end up closing at 09:00GMT somewhere in between SL and TP. The reason I chose to set the TP for the monthly goal, is that every now and then, this candle has a huge range. It wouldn't be impossible for us to see a 50-60 pip candle, so we could make our monthly goal early on.. And rather than just close the trade with the candle close and have no TP, by setting it this way, you don't have to worry about it reaching the target and coming back... If it hits the target, it closes, and your month is done. This concept is based on the MM I use in my manual trading. I generally only take trades manually that I think will be at least 1:4 r/r. Basically, you only need one trade to hit TP in a month to have made your 10%...

GU looks like a good short maybe a rounded top coming in next few days.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
How did you determine this as an entry point?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks Jag. However, this isn't based on fundamentals or technical analysis. Entry is determined solely by where the 08:00 opening price is in relation to the 00:00 opening price.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Quite literally by studying hourly G/U charts, and first seeing visually that the 08:00 candle is (a) often a large candle, and (b) often at, or near, a "reversal point" that seems to happen with this pair more often than not. I spent several days looking for ways to capitalize on this reversal that frequently occurs, and this was the result. But as I said earlier, this is an experiment.... I am forward testing a theory here. I have no idea if it will prove out..

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Today we entered short at 1.5638. Closed at the close of the 08:00 candle at 1.5642. Net loss was 4 pips. Net % loss was 0.37% Tomorrow's target is 10.37% Risk:Reward = 1:4.148 Target TP = 83 pips

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This was actually a logic error in my EA. This trade SHOULD have hit SL and closed with a 20 pip loss. It took a while to realize, what actually happened was it opened and closed the trade at the same time - the 4 pip loss was spread. I'll have it fixed for tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
why you pick 08:00GMT and 00:00GMT for your system ? thanks for share --------- RSI S+R .

--- 帖子 #16 ---
What evidence do you have that you are able to take 10% a month out of this market ? Do you appreciate how astronomical an edge that is ?

Answered above: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...8&amp;postcount=12

--- 帖子 #18 ---
None, yet. That's why we test like this. Actually, yes, I do appreciate the r:r. My manual trading operates on a similar principal. I generally only take trades manually with 1:3 or 1:4 risk:reward. I am patient, may only take 2-3 trades a month and only take setups that have this potential. I normally risk 2-3% per trade, so yes, my typical "win" when I trade manually is between 6 and 12%. When all is said and done, I am manually pulling out between 8-10% most months. So yes, I believe it can be done. Maybe not automated, but definitely manually for someone who is patient enough to only take trades with a high r/r. This approach is new (for me). I've observed something on several years worth of charts, and am applying a MM strategy with a very high risk:reward to it to see if it works out. Yes, it is unlikely the first trade of the month will close the month out - that's not the intent. The intent is that EVENTUALLY the month will close out. From the little I've run through manually so far, I'm finding trades closing somewhere between the 20-pip (2.5%) SL and the target with the close of the candle. And with this candle showing a range of 50+ pips often enough, that's more than half of my month. If I'm already halfway to target and hit one of those big candles in the right direction, I've made the month. The 20-pip SL prevents a huge loss if I'm entered in the wrong direction. Maybe it will play out, maybe it won't. But to me, it's worth trying. Any very simple "system" like this that is totally non-discretionary that I can automate to supplement my manual trading is worth exploring. If it doesn't work out, I'll move on to another one. If it does, it goes on auto-pilot pulling in some pips when it can.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Nice answer, so thanks. Of course ANY idea is worth testing and I hope it works out for you. I just feel that 10% a month is a huge expectation and is why so many new traders fail - they start with too high expectations and too little money. Best of luck with your testing.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I agree 100%. It's taken me years to get where I am - with a lot of lost money and high expectations along the way. I would NEVER trade this, or any other automated system exclusively. Nor, would I recommend to anyone just starting out that they put their entire bankroll on ANY automated strategy. The only way to truly be successful is to study, study, study and develop a plan. I primarily trade the daily charts, S/R, trendlines, and PA. That's my steady, consistent strategy. And it takes a ton of discipline to only go after the low-risk / high-reward potential trades. Little distractions like these help fill in the gaps between those trades

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I am found something inerested at this forum something unique and profitable but how can we depend on EA and does it really work with 10% profit I use xtremepipoacher and fapturbo one of the best in the market and I am getting 5% result on demo that it........... but I am in the system would look for further updates thanks for tweeting and creating this forum

--- 帖子 #22 ---
The two EAs you just quoted are very poor and have a longterm negative expectation, so I'd drop them now before you lose too much.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
this brings an interesting thing, can a very good MM startegy make a pure strategy look better ? why should we go LONG when the trend is down in last 8 hours ? why cant we go in same direction ? also if we do this, i would test with 5% instead of 10. also i would aim for only 5% TP in first week , not 10% as i would nt think just one trade will hit your monthly trade. stoploss would be 1.25% if we get 5 consequitive SL (its very easy to go wrong by 20 pips at market open), then our TP target is doubled and it becomes very difficlut to get so many pips in just 1 hour. so we are waiting for that one magic trade sacrificing every day losses its easy to back test manually for last one month and see what happens

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Sounds like an interesting variation. I'm going to stick with the way I wrote it up to see if it has merit, but definitely feel free to post in the thread how your variation is working out should you decide to test it...

--- 帖子 #25 ---
i tested this manually in 2010. out of 12 months, 9 months have hit 10% target. aug resulted in 7% loss, jan resulted in 16% loss. i couldnt test may month as i have some data issue. one winning month didnt give 10% but gave 6% i stop trading in that month once monthly target is met, most of months have reached target by 15th itself. some have gone till month end. this shows we can do more experiments like continuing after target is reached , increasing 10% etc overall looks good, i dont see any reason to change the original rules.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Personally I think MM strategy is the KEY in FX

--- 帖子 #27 ---
roundrock, While I appreciate your work, please read the very last sentence of the first post. I have requested that nobody post an EA in this thread to avoid turning it in to a support thread. Would you please edit your post to remove the EA and post it in a separate thread? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
as per my initial tests, i found continuing trading even after monthly target is met is a better option. there are few instances , where monthly target is met on first day itself. also this strategy with these settings didnt work on EU.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I'd be interested to see what the max gain could be. Thanks for the edit above - I think that will help us stay on track with the strategy and variations and not get tied up in "can you make the EA do this" or "I can't get the EA to run" kind of stuff...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Took 8 pips last night (thought there was again an issue with my workstation, so this wasn't accurate for the system, but I am moving forward with the results I get while I work out my technical issues). Gain of 0.48% so far for the month. 9.52% remain until target Tomorrow's r/r: 1:3.8 Tomorrow's TP target: 76 pips.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
in 2010, without stopping after 10% rule, 10k became 22k. with stopping rule, 10k became 16k. similar results in 2009, 2008 btw, we already reached 10% profit if you count from jan 01

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yeah, it was right after that happened that I decided to share this with the forum...

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Couldn't agree more. This is a business, and you need to know how you will keep your business running next week, next month, next year. Capital preservation is more important than anything else.

I see a system what make me to take an Eye on it thanks for share that. please , may I miss something, but why the last trade close at 11:00 clock candle today. I read to close every trade on 9:00 thanks cheers

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I mentioned earlier, I had some technical issues today (my trades are automated, because I am not awake at 08:00GMT). But yes, the trade should always be closed at 09:00GMT if it hasn't hit TP or SL.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
sorry I miss that, I'm in Asia, here it is late already 23:40, I'm tired also :-) cheers

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I made a comment about this that was buried inside another post, but it really should be made clear, ESPECIALLY for new traders.... This "system" is really not "trading". It's gambling. Yes, we are taking advantage of a probability, and yes we are applying some creative money management to hopefully profit from this discovery. But at the end of the day, it's a "bet" that something which has happened in the past will continue to happen. There is no foundation, analysis, or "strategy" behind this. All of this said, "trading" in the true sense, requires committment. It requires study. I posted this because it was something that I discoverd while studying charts. Hopefully it will turn out to be profitable and become a tool for traders to use. But don't think for a second that you can simply apply this method every day and you will become a successful trader. In the end, you will have learned nothing. And if/when the day comes that this no longer works, you'll be right back where you started - looking for the next "system" or "get rich quick" magic bullet. So, use this. Experiment with it. Maybe even trade it WITH A SMALL ACCOUNT if you think it will work for you. But don't let it be a substitute for education. Real trading success will take a lot more than this or any other "system" that you will find here or anywhere else. Studying the markets, developing a technically and fundamentally sound plan, and applying that plan every single day is the only way you will truly succeed.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I'm tired all the time - I know the feeling

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I think in the last trade has used a sl of 30 instead of 20 regards

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Good observation.... I didn't mention this because this is done by my EA. I want to keep this thread on the topic of the "system" and not focus on the EA (which is also why I haven't posted it), but here's what is happening and why you see that: My EA manages the 20-pip SL and whatever the TP is internally. The order will be closed (by the "rules") if it reaches -20 pips or the "target" TP. The SL and TP that are actually sent with the order by my EA are 10-pips above/below. It won't affect the system - technically speaking, the SL and TP that show up in the myfxbook log should NEVER be hit unless my computer gets disconnected from the intenet and can't manage the trade (and therefore, the trade isn't out there without a SL and can't blow the account if I'm disconnected). Funny, I was disconnected last night (which is what caused my issues earlier), so while this didn't come in to play, it is exactly the reason this is in there.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Is it still somehow possible to get the EA that you are talking about? You already mentioned it, so probably many people are interested.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No. I will not be posting my EA. I did not create it with the intention of it working for anyone other than myself under my platfrom and parameters. I am still not 100% confident that it is operating properly. And perhaps most importantly, I've seen far too many threads on FF that get sidetracked from discussing the system to supporting the EA or asking for additional features. If someone else comes up with one and wants to share it (in a separate thread), I have no problem at all with that. I'm sorry if anyone isn't happy with this, but it really is about the simplest possible strategy to code - there are no indicators. Just open a trade at 08:00GMT with a SL and TP and close it at 09:00 if it is still open. There is no doubt it my mind someone will slap one together if this system starts to show potential and post it in a separate thread, allowing this one to stay free of "EA discussion".

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I understand your point. But my intention was not to start any discussions about EAs. I just wanted to know if you can share it as a tool for managing trades and hiding SL/TP. Maybe even not by posting it here but sending via e-mail.

Referring to post 39 in the trade of 13/01/2011 buy at 1.57426 and stoploss should be 1.57226 ( no 1.57128). The minimum is 1.57179 so the trade is losing regards

--- 帖子 #48 ---
21 pip loss today (spread was part of this, which is why it was more than 20 but not stopped out). I went in long at exactly 08:00 at 1.5837. Closed with the close of the candle (came within 0.1 pip of stopping out, but didn't on my platform) This was a loss of 2.16% So, for tomorrow: 11.66% to go for the month. 1:4.66 r:r TP target = 93 pips

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I assume that the open price of the 00:00 GMT candle is used, irrespective of whether there was a gap from Friday or Sunday? Also, that the 9:00 open is used and not the close of the 8:00 candle - in case there is a gap

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Yes, always compare the open of the 08:00GMT candle to the open of the 00:00GMT candle to determine the direction of the trade. I've not seen many gaps between 08:00 and 09:00, and I don't think it will come in to play often or make a huge difference when it does, but I technically close the trade with the first tick of the 09:00 candle.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
During your back tests, how did you guys incorporate the spread? My broker gives me a 4 to 5 spread, so my margin of error is really 15 if I use a 20 SL.

Stopped out today for a loss of 22-pips (spread included). -2.42% For tomorrow: Target: 14.59% r:r - 1:5.83 TP target: 117 pips

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I factor the spread in. When my trade is placed, the volume is calculated based on 20-pips plus the spread at the time of the order. My "stop" isn't set as a SL, bur rather triggers the order to close if price has moved 20-pips against me. When that happens, the close will actually be for a loss of 20 plus the spread. This is exactly what happened today. The trade closed when it went against me by 20. The final loss was 22, but it was still only the 2.5% (2.42 actually) because it was all factored in when the trade was placed.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Roundrock - when you did your back tests and you compared stopping after 10% vs continuing, what target did you use? Did you start as if it was a new month ie aim for 10% again or did you have a fixed TP?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i didnt do compounding, each month is treated for same initial account size 10k and tp 10% i did additional tests to let it run even after reaching 10%. here also same settings. each month is a test itself if you do compounding, then the profitability will increase

I like what you are doing, i think you are on the right track, if you allow me to give you an advice you should take in account that you could lose even 20-25 times in a row, i say this to prevent demoralization during loss streak because believe me, they will happen. About the idea you're betting, not trading, you re on the right track again, your mindset is good keep up the good work!! stick to your plan and you'll earn a lot of money (and lose a lot, bear in mind) from this system.

I agree, nothing is a sure thing. I"ve done manual backtests back through the beginning of 2007, and have never had more that 4 consecutive 20-pip losses. Yes, there were some streaks that went as many as 8-10 consecutive losses, but not to stop out. And yes, while this has overall been profitable since 2007 (again, in manual backtests), it absolutely can, and probably will, eventually stop working due to market changes or other factors. Patience is something you develop as a trader. For some it comes sooner than others. But your point about staying in the right mindset during a losing streak is a very good one that new traders need to understand. Not just with this system, but with any system. When you develop a plan, stick with it. When you start "tweaking" it every day just because you've run in to string of losses, that's when you start spinning your wheels and not getting anywhere. Accept your losses as part of your cost of doing business, and get right back in following your plan the next day. I said it earlier in this thread... Trading is a business. Treat it like one. Know that you will have better days than others, and make sure you know how to keep your business alive to see tomorrow, next week, next year, etc... Despite what you may see in the hundreds of websites trying to sell you today's hottest no-loss trading robot, nobody is getting rich overnight in Forex. Those that are successful have put in their time, have developed the discipline and patience it takes to succeed, and are trading a plan. None of them are attaching a robot to a chart and just sitting there watching the pips roll in.

If you're able to trade this manually, you could avoid situations like this in a way similar to what I do... Send your trade with a stop loss high enough that the spread won't affect you, and close the trade manually if it moves 20-pips against you. Of course, you could also experiment with the system to suit your taste. For example, maybe you'd find that a 30-pip stop would work better for you. Just adjust the math to try that... Calculate 2.5% of your account across 30-pips instead of 20. You'll end up with a smaller lot size, and your targets will be higher, but you may find in your case that a modification like this turns the system in to a winner for you.

today i kept my sl slightly higher so that its above the resistence. price just cam close to resistence and fell down. i always consider nearest support, resistence and round number and adjust my stoploss slightly. but in any case i dont go more than 25-30 pips. if i cant adjust within this, i place 50% lot at this price and remaining on a discount (wait for a retrace).

Hi Cgrey couple of questions if I may, lets say for example the month is going quite well and we are only a very small amount away from reaching our 10% for the month , do we still use a 20pip stop as we may only need 10 pips or so to hit our 10% so risk reward would be really bad. When you say risk 2.5% of account on every trade is this on opening balance of month or does this go up and down depending on balance through month? Many Thanks Geoff

I'll start by saying this: What I've presented here is an idea. I encourage you to make it your own. Your "rule" for stoploss doesn't have to be the same as mine. Having said that, the way I will be trading this going forward is that my SL will always be 20 pips, even if my target is only 10. Yes, for this one trade, my r:r ends up being negative. But I am not treating this system as a "trade-by-trade" system. I am treating this system as "monthy target" system, and I am done trading for the month once my target is hit. Therefore, I am putting less emphasis on any individual trade, and more focus on the overall target / end result. This concept can take a while for some to fully grasp, since most people would generally just continue to trade, not planning to stop at any specific daily/weekly/monthly target level. This makes the r:r for every individual trade much more important. In my case, anything I do "live" with this system will be a supplement to my manual trading, I will be perfectly happy to turn it off one week in to the month if my goal has been met, and start up again the next month. You may be equally comfortable stopping if you're up 8.5% for the month instead of risking 2.5% to gain the last 1.5%. It's really an individual decision for every trader - this is just a tool for you to use how you see fit. Your second question addresses some more complicated math that I tried to avoid in the first post to not confuse people too much... I will explain it here, at the risk that it may make things more complex for some folks than it needs to be... My 2.5% risk is calculated at the time of the trade, and is based on the CURRENT account balance. Spread is also factored in here, which even further complicates the math. My 10% target, though, is based on the monthly OPENING balance. As a result, as the month progresses, it also impacts the lot size, which in turn impacts the exact TP target for each trade. In reality, none of the actual calculations I do for SL and TP are based on pips. Everything I calculate is based on %. I provide the pip counts in my examples because it makes it easier to follow. But to take your questions a step further, as the month progresses, if I'm up, my risk per trade as compared to the opening balance is actually increased. This results in larger lot size, which in turn actually makes the target TP a few less pips. The opposite is true if I'm down for the month. This also helps explain, for those that are curious, why I had a trade stop out earlier in the month and I only lost 2.42% instead of 2.5% - at the time of that trade, I was down slightly for the month, so while that trade was 2.5% of the current balance, since that balance was lower than the opening balance, the loss was actually a smaller percentage of the opening balance. By this point, I've probably thoroughly confused everyone... For those that are more comfortable dealing in pips than percentages, the difference is minor. And, like the first paragraph above, people should feel free to experiment and trade it the way they're most comfortable. You can just as easily do one calculation at the beginning of the month and use the same lot size for every trade in the month, rather than recacluate every day. In the end, I don't think it would make a world of difference, since the target is always the same 10% of the opening balance. In fact, you could go so far as to say you start the month needing to gain 80 pips. (4*20). After you calcualte your lot size, use that same lot size every day. Keep a running count of how many pips you've gained/lost as the month goes on. When you are +80, you've made your 10%. Your TP target every day is the difference between your current pip total and the 80 you started out needing. But yes, the way I am trading it is purely as a % gain, so my numbers will be slightly different than the way I presented it for simplicity.

Nice to be able to do this. Good idea to add some thought to this. Since I'm sleeping during this time, I can't take advantage of this extra edge that you gave yourself, but it's a great lesson on how to start with the general idea and make it work for you.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Many thanks for such a quick and comprehensive reply, you have made things much clearer now. Geoff

I was expecting the exact opposite - I thought I probably lost at least half of anyone that was still following

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Another alternative if you are uncomfortable with the r:r if you are approaching your monthly target... If you are within 2.5% of the monhtly target, just set your TP for these trades at 2.5% to give yourself a minimum of 1:1 r:r. The upside, if you hit TP, you end the month with more than 10% profit. The downside, if the trade goes past the 1% that you NEEDED but not quite to the 2.5% that you WANTED and then reverses and closes for a loss, not only do you not hit your overall 10% target, but now you have to trade another day to get to your target. For me, it's all about hitting the target, quitting while I'm ahead, and preserving my capital to keep my business going in to next month. There are a lot of variables to consider, but in the end, you need to be comfortable with how you decide to handle this type of situation, and most of all, stick to it, however you decide to address it.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
cgrey, it might help some people if we have a excel that does all the math. we can hide all the complexity (its not that much actually) and let user enter entry price, monthly starting balance, risk percentage per trade, monthly target as varaibles. anyway we have already met the 10% target for this month even before this thread is started, so if we are seeing any losses now its actaully not part of the system. we are doing it for practice. we will start actual trading from feb 1 meanwhile, i tried back testing other pairs with different numbers that it didnt work. only GU worked, remaining pairs are inconsistent. i havent found a winning year. i tried changing starting hour, trading hour, risk, tp %... in any case if we are doing 2 pairs in same account, then the overall risk goes up , so not a good idea. in this system strict descipline is important. we should be able to withstand the max dd

I think the simplest thing anyone can do if they're not fully understanding the math, is to follow my advice in my previous post about having an 80-pip target for the month. This way, they can easily adjust risk to their taste... I think the 20 pip SL is important to leave intact. So, if someone would prefer to take a more conservative approach, simply figure out how much they want to risk per trade (%), and multiply that by 4 to get their monthly target. So, if I were more comfortable risking 1% per trade instead of 2.5%, my monthly target would end up being 4% instead of 10. Everything else remains the same - 20 pip SL per trade, 80 pips "target" per month, subtracting the amount of pips won each day (or adding the amount of pips lost) to 80 to get the next day's overall target. Yes, I am planning to start a "journal" thread late next week to begin February's trades in, so I can record my trades there and leave this thread free for any additional discussion about the "system" or money management. The nice thing is, this is a very uncomplicated system. There isn't much to discuss. There are no indicators to interpret, no template to tweak. I encourage people to play around with it as I've said earlier, but I wouldn't start getting in to adding indicators, filters or anything else.. I'll be sticking around here to answer questions, but I would imagine the thread will be winding down much sooner than some others that seem to go on forever with new modifications and interpretations.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Just thinking outloud here, but wouldn't risking 20 pips per day, five days a week, to make 80 pips, end up being a risk to reward of 400 to 80, which is about 4:1?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I wouldn't expect this to work on any other pairs... But, I can tell you for sure that there are similar "patterns" that can be exploited on other pairs at other times of day. I said earlier, I trade manually. I trade high time frames (daily) and am incredibly patient - I only take a few very high r:r trades per month, and am in them for days or even weeks. So I spend a lot of time waiting. Therefore, I have a bunch of time to find these little distractions. EUR/USD, EUR/JPY and USD/JPY also have repeatable patterns that can be exploited in a similar way. I wouldn't be surprised if others do that I just haven't discovered yet. I've been live trading a similar indicator-free, very mechanical system on E/J for a couple of years now, and consistently profiting 3-4% per month from it. So what I'm trying to say is, study charts long enough, and you'll start seeing things. Often, all it takes is good (or CREATIVE) money management to exploit something that occurs fairly regularly.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Can you share your E/J mechanical system, or tell us where to read about it?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
While it seems that way at first, no. If I risk 20 today to get 80 and break even, when tomorrow comes, I'm not risking 20 for 0, I'm risking 20 for 80 again. If I lost 20 today, tomorrow I'm risking 20 for 100. So, even though I have a single 80-pip target for the month, there is still a target left (the reward side) every single day. Just as you'd add the risk every day to get the total risk calculated over 20 days, you'd also add the reward every day to get the total reward over 20-days. Yes, it will end up at less than 1:4 (depending on how many days it took to reach the 80-pip total target), or more than 1:4 if you happen to end the month at a loss. So far this month, I've made 8-trades, at 20-pips risk each. 20x8=160 total risk. My "targets" have been 80, 83, 76, 93, 97, 117, 110, 74. Add them up to get 730. So, for the month-to-date= 160:730, or 1:4.5625. Also consider that way more often than not, the trade closes in an hour hitting neither SL or TP. Getting a true r:r calculation when you expect going in that neither your TP or SL is likely to be hit is all but impossible. Unlike "normal" trades, we're not expecting ours to close every single time at SL or TP, we are pretty sure it is going to close somewhere in between. This approach of having a single monthly target and being finished when you hit it requires a different way of thinking. And it's definitely not for everyone. Generally speaking, traders are accustomed to trading 5 days a week, four weeks a month, possibly placing several trades per day. Hopefully, they have a plan that includes what their r:r will be. But rarely, if ever, will their target for the next trade be influenced by the previous trade(s). Every trade is it's own, independent of every other. What we're doing here is treating each trade as a part of the whole.

The original system thread was here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=181945 I also had a journal that I kept for a couple of months while I was still in demo with it, but things got real busy at work and I didn't have time to maintain it. I wasn't trading full-time yet back then. It started out as a breakout/straddle type of system that someone else had discovered, and I applied some money management to it. I have no interest in resurrecting that thread, so I likely won't respond within the system thread any further - it was another pretty cut-and-dry type system. Like this one, I don't see much more that can be done with it. I should be able to do a better job keeping the journal for this one up to date now, though.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
This makes perfect sense, thanks for the explanation. One question I have: why do you consider this gambling? If I understand the difference between gambling and trading it would be that gamblers have no edge, they attempt to make money using the house's edge, which in the long-run is an impossibility, whereas traders have developed an edge of some kind. Your method here has an edge, it seems to me, in that you have an entry based on historically positive probabilities, you have a money management system, and you have well-defined and controlled risk/reward. So why do you consider this gambling? What am I missing?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thank you. Are you still trading this one (the EUR/JPY one you mention in the below link)? I understand that you trade for a living, is this your main method?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I'll answer both questions in one, because they're actually somewhat related... I consider this type of system "gambling" because there really is no fundamental or technical basis for it. Real trading, to me, is based on years of study. It is having a plan. Studying the markets, analyzing situations, picking your spots. I've been on FF for about 4-years, and have been trading for around 6-years in total. Up until about 2-years ago, I tried every "system" under the sun. Had charts full of indicators, downloaded every robot I could get my hands on, and never got anywhere. Then I started studying. I started to understand global economics. The REAL reason why a currency moves (significantly) is because of some event - be in related to a commodity market, a political event, a change in a country's interest rate, an election, "bailout", etc, etc, etc..... A currency does NOT move because RSI just crossed 50 or because stoch is oversold. That last sentence is the most important one to take from this entire thread. A currency DOES NOT MOVE because of indicators. Indicators tell you what a currency HAS DONE, and can give you a PROBABILITY about what it may do. But if RSI crosses up over 50 2-minutes before some real world "event" causes a shift in the market, which do you think is going to determine where the currency goes? When you make that discovery, and the lightbulb goes off, you've just taken the first step from amateur to professional trader. There are a lot of pretty good amateur traders here (I don't post much, but I read FF almost every day). And frankly, many of them think they really "get it" and are convinced that as long as all their indicators line up, it's a sure sign of what the market will do. And some really are very good at understanding and interpreting the indicators. But even those with the best "systems" based on indicators - how many are really "professional" traders? How many are still here years later, and are still successful with their "systems"? And yes, there are a handful of pros, too, and they're easy to spot. I can promise you, they're not posting charts that look like Christmas trees. There are probably a dozen threads, MAX on FF that are really worth anything to a professional. And I can promise, they're not talking about MA crosses or RSI lining up across timeframes. Sorry if this offends anyone, I'm sure it will. This is just my opinion, and I think I'm in a position to speak to it, since I can call myself a "professional trader". Trading is knowing the "big picture", and understanding the real reason why EU has been moving up the past two weeks (and it isn't because it touched a weekly trendline). Trading is living and breathing the markets, and how they inter-relate. Being a professional trader is knowing the answer if you ran in to someone on the street and they asked "which has been stronger since the beginning of the year this year, the pound or the yen"? - without looking at a chart, can anyone reading this answer that question right now? I'm sure there are a few... Trading is understanding how currencies affect each other, and how other markets effect currencies. It is knowing that the USD will generally be moving down when the NYSE is moving up, and the reason WHY that happens. Yes, I made the jump to trading full-time for a living right around a year ago. And it was after the light bulb went off and I had true confidence in my trading not because an indicator told me what to do, but because I finally understood WHY the market was doing what it was doing. Another big part of trading is patience. I am a long-term trader.. I trade D1 and higher (though I often use 15M or H1 for entries). I do make use of s/r, trendlines and candlestick patterns, again more as a tool to fine-tune entries because everyone else uses them, and as a result, there is generally some action around them. However, when I do take a position, I intend to be in it long term. And I'm usually after a r:r of 1:4 or more. I'll occasionally go as low as 1:2, but rarely. I may only take 3-4 trades in a month. So, I spend a lot of time "working", but not a lot of time actually pushing the button and placing trades. That gives me the chance to try out stuff like what I've presented here. I guess I look at it as a hobby (gambling, with an edge). Well, I guess I was feeling inspired this morning. Probably gave you way more info than you were after... And again, all of this is my opinion. I'm sure many people will have a different opinion than mine, and I can completely respect that. This is what has worked for me, so I'm sticking to it. (oh, and no... By now you probably have realized the other E/J system is just another one of the little 'distractions' I have in between what I consider to be my "real" trading - though yes, it has been running along on its own for more than a year now and has remained profitable most months)..

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Well this is certainly more education than you'd get in a 2 hour paid class on "how technical analysis moves the market!" Nice job! Ok, let's say that for me the light bulb has gone off (or rather, come on ) and I understand that EUR/USD is going to go up when Europe raises interest rates and US does not. Or a number of other factors. How do I then turn my knowledge into a practical trading system of some kind? I do understand that fundamentals, news reports, economic data, etc. drive the market, but I do not understand how to profit off of that knowledge. And on the next subject, isn't "gambling with an edge" trading? In my understanding gambling is gambling, whereas gambling with an edge is trading. Sorry for all the questions, I'm sure you have better things to do than answer them, no problem if unable. Thank you again.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Sometimes I just get going and can't stop myself. Then I re-read and feel the need to clarify... About the above post. What I didn't get in to that rant is that there are certainly some people that are VERY GOOD indicator-based traders. It is my opinion that you can only go so far on indicators alone. All the stuff I mentioned about fundamentals is the "next level", as far as I'm concerned. It is what makes the difference between "amateur" and "professional" .. It's the immersion factor, the true big-picture understanding that sets the pros apart. I'm certain those that are very good at indicator based trading are successful, and they should be proud of their accomplishments. Though it may have sounded this way above, I am not trying to belittle them or think that they're not real traders. For ME, I found I could not make the transition to treat this as my livelihood without really getting heavily in to the fundamental side. For others, they may be just fine. In the end, if you're successful and earning money, you're doing something right. If you're spinning your wheels with one indicator based system after another and not getting anywhere, you eventually need to decide if a different approach is needed to get you where you want to be.

I will give you some answers... I've got a bunch of "family stuff" on my plate now that the weekend is here, so I will be coming back to this. Some day I will start a thread that has nothing to do with "systems" and focuses more or "strategy" (I believe they are different). There would probably also be some interest in a thread on how to operate a "business" of trading, which also plays a big part in setting the pros apart from the amateurs. When I get some time to really dig in to this later this weekend, I may just start a new thread and link to it here... Stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
20 pips SL is nothing for Cable, little kick and you're out of the game.. To win you probably should have 70-80 (unless you are playing M1/M5 scalping) pips SL at least, otherwise lose to win ratio going to be 5 to1. IMHO. Good luck anyways.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Dreamliner... I've given this some thought today while getting some stuff around the house done... I think we'll be going off in a different direction, so I will start a new thread with some of these thoughts... Truth be told, this is going to be a little tough for me. I am one of those people that can do, and I fully understand what I do and how I do it, but it will really take some work for me to "teach" how I go about applying what is in my head to a "system" or "strategy" (I think "strategy" is a better word for it). And while I want to answer your questions, I don't think I have it in me to run a thread like J16 or Jacko or any of the others that really "teach" and turn in to thousand-page works... I give guys like them a lot of credit for being able to spend so much time "giving back". So I really need to start giving some thought to how I will present some of this, and not end up with a full time job monitoring my thread and answering questions. I do want to help, and to give back... I will just have limited time for it and want to be careful about starting something I can't, or don't want to finish. So, in a few days I should be able to come up with something meaningful, and find a way to present it.

Thanks cgrey, I appreciate you counting the cost, no problem on whatever you decide.

Nice thread. Method is simple to understand and follow. I also like the dialogue and thought process of what it means/takes to be a "pro" - consistently profitable. I have been at it for few years and can honestly say it took me awhile to stop losing money. If I had enough capital I would be devoted 100% to trading for a living. However, I work full time and use forex to supplement income. In a way that's good because my job serves as the 'distractions'. I know what you mean by maintaining a thread is plenty of work. Not that I've ever started a thread that became big, but I see some of the other ones and they are hundreds of pages. I wouldn't want to do it, but I'm glad you at least started this one (if no other). Anyway, just want to say thanks again for sharing the method and your insights into trading.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Excellent. That's another big step... Not necessarily winning, but when you stop consistently losing, you're making progress. I blew a couple of accounts in my first 2-years. And in that time I learned a whole lot. Most importantly, that I didn't know half of what I thought I did about how to trade. Having enough capital is the easy part. Confidence and belief in yourself if the hard part. Need capital? Go to the bank. Seriously.. Let's do some more math here. Let's say you feel you can afford to lose $3000. Let's further say that you are confident that you can be profitable, or at the very worst, only have an occasional losing month for a small percentage of your account (like 2-3%). Go get yourself a $30,000 loan. (Do yourself a favor, set up a corporation or LLC first, more on that possibly later). Open your trading account with the $30k, and put that $3k that you said you can afford to lose someplace safe that you will absolutely never touch it. Start trading. Use the profits to make the monthly payment on your loan. Do well enough, and you'll more than cover that each month. If you ever start running in to a really bad stretch, QUIT when you are down $3k. Take the $27k left in your account and cash out, add your $3k back to it, and give the bank back their money. Regroup and do it again later when you build some more confidence and can keep winning consistently. Is it possible to do this? Absolutely. This is exactly what I did when I started out (not the same amount of money, but the exact same concept). And as I became more and more profitable, I was able to double-up on the loan payments so I'm on track to pay it off well before it's due. Still, I always have my "seed money" put safely aside (and occasionally add to it for a cushion), so even the in absolute worst scenario, I'll always be able to cash out and pay off the loan. In effect, I was able to start with 10-times the amount of money that I would have, and as a result, my 8-10% per month is more like 80-100% of my "seed". And the nice thing is, the monthly loan payment is fixed, but the account compounds, so each month it takes a smaller and smaller % win to make sure I cover the loan payment. Remember, this is a business, and this is how businesses operate - other people's money....

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Well this is certainly an eye opener. Well said, nice concepts here! I think you would agree that if a person is not consistently profitable they have no business taking out a trading loan, right? Nowadays, with Oanda , we can deposit $10.00 and see if we can make it last longer than the last time .

--- 帖子 #104 ---
It really depends on your risk. It keeps coming back to trading being a business. Like any other business, you run the risk of failure. If you're going to open a restaurant, chances are you will need a loan. If you're going to buy a McDonald's franchise, you're going to need a loan. If you're going to trade professionally, as a business, get a loan to be properly capitalized and make money by using someone else's money. You're not going to succeed if you jump in with $5k. Well, maybe you will, but can you survive on maybe $300-400 month income (and that's if you're lucky enough to pull in 6-8% per month)? But if you jump in with $50k, confidence, dedication, and a good plan that you've thoroughly tested and honestly believe can be successful, you've got a legitimate shot. No... This is not something anyone should be doing until they are totally committed to trading for a living, have developed a business plan and proven some success. It would also be foolish, in my opinion, to take this approach without that deep understanding of markets. Trust me, I'm not putting $50k on this "system" in this thread, or any other. I'm probably not even putting $5k in to this system if I go live with it. My money stays where my strengths are, and where my knowledge and expertise will determine my success, not the luck of the draw or a line crossing over another one. If you don't have that, and you've decided to trade for a living full-time based on a system you found in a trading forum, or worse, a robot you bought for $97 from a "dear friend" website, you're doomed to failure before you even get started. But for that person who believes they are ready (as 2+2 said above), when you've put in your time, and you're ready to make the commitment to make this your profession, don't let lack of capital stop you, there will be plenty of other hurdles that you will need to overcome.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Wow, an eye opener indeed. I never quite thought of the seed money and loan concept, although I have thought of getting private investors. I know I can handle the larger account size. The actual balance size doesn't faze me. It's definitely something I will look to do and get into more, even if I never become a full time trader. My objective right now is to string another 6-12 consecutive months of overall profitable trading. If I can produce an average of 5-10% monthly after the 6-12 months (not saying every month, but on average) I will look to get $50K. With that capital devoted solely to currency trading and the rate I'm confident in achieving, I know I can pay my bills, live, save and increase my account. The power of compounding is amazing. I believe Albert Einstein referred to compounding as the 8th wonder of the world. Or something like that. EDIT: Just googled the Einstein quote on compounding interest. He said it's the most powerful force in the universe. I was way off with the wonder of the world thing, lol.

Here's where discipline will come in. Make absolutely sure you put that 10% aside. And if you are down 10% in the trading account get out. Don't let the "I'll win it back next month" mentality kick in if you have a few straight down months that put you in the hole. Then you end up blowing the account and still having to pay back the loan. Discipline is absolutely critical, as is accepting if things aren't going your way and taking the time to regroup and try again. The bank will be all too happy to lend you money again next year if you've paid them back on time this time around. They won't even talk to you next year if you default on the loan... And, do consider setting yourself up properly as a business (assuming you're in the US, that would mean a corporation or LLC). Aside from the tax benefits, you can protect your personal capital to a certain extent as well.

I understand what you mean. I would be dead set on giving the bank back the money with my 10% loss if the trading went sour. That is definitely something I would not play around with. I would also make sure not to quit my job right after taking out the loan. I would first make sure things went like the business model I planned before I rely entirely or almost entirely on the trading. Also would like to stash most of the profits into the seed money those first months while my regular job pays the bills. I am in the USA so corp or LLC thing will be neccessary. Again, thanks for the advice and help.

Couple more questions: "If the 08:00GMT open price is higher than the 00:00GMT open price, we GO SHORT. SL is ALWAYS 20 pips. TP is calculated as described above. If neither TP or SL have been hit, CLOSE THE TRADE at the open of the 09:00GMT candle ." #1 Let's say your TP is 70 pips, how possibly you can expect 70 pips to hit within 1 hour (very unlikely scenario)? So basically, you closing at 9:00 GMT for whatever profit is there could be 15 pips could be 30 right? #2 Spread is included in 20 pips SL? Or, if I have 4 pips spread, I should calculate 24 pips SL, right? Thanks. that be it. Regards, Sky.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
let me answer these questions. #1: our target is to reach the monthly goal of 10%. so every trade should aim for this goal and we shut the shop once we reach that. lot of times we dont hit that goal in one trade, but we should aim for that. in my backtesting i have seen couple of times the first day of the month itself hit the 10% target. around 40% of times we went to end of month to reach or not reach monthly goal. remaining times we reached the target in first 15 days itself. we take whatever market gives in that one hour but our aim should always be to reach the monthly goal #2: yes, include spread. but again its not a hard rule that we should always have 20 SL. risk should always be 2.5%, so adjust your lotsize based on SL. But 20 is a good number, so stick to it (based on tests). also i consider nearest support, resistence, round numbers nearby and adjust the SL 5-10 pips. not much. if its beyond this, i try to enter 50% at system price and remaining 50% at a discount (wait for retrace, but risk is we may not see a retracement). cgrey has shown the way, now its upto us to adopt to suit our trading style, personalities. its such a simple system and you need to spend only a hour on this.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
No disrespect intended. I think it's more a matter of the "concept" of treating each trade as a part of the whole that may need to be clearer for this to "click" for you. Most threads, people need to get their head around "triggers" for the actual trade based on a bunch of indicators. In this one, the entries and exits are crystal clear, it's the money management aspect that is different for most people. #1 - I don't expect to hit TP during the early days of the month. But, yes, it can happen. This month, I was demo-trading this before I posted. We hit the 10% target in three trading days, due mostly to a 78-pip 1-hour candle that occurred on January 4th. Large 08:00GMT candles do happen pretty often on this pair, and that's one reason this system seems to work. The TP is a target, that closes out our month if hit. It is not an expectation. Yes, you're closing in an hour with whatever you get. It has also proven to be rare that the 20-pip SL is hit during that hour, despite how "small" a move it is for this pair. On averages it's happened 4-5 times per month in my manual testing back to 2007. But 20 is the largest possible loss. Conversely, we close with MORE than 20 pips at least 4-5 times per month as well because the only thing limiting our gain is the TP we set (intentionally because it is our overall monthly target). #2 - Check some previous posts for the answer to this. I've explained how I calculate to include spread here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...8&amp;postcount=58 , and have also offered a couple of suggestions on how to handle this in another post.

Thanks, fair enough.. Good luck.. Unfortunately timing for those trades are is in the middle of the night in my area. I won't be able to play with it, But scrolling back and watching 0.00- 8 GMT times, I see those opportunities. Only other thing to consider. We used to trade with Cable Tokyo EA, which was also based on price action (Pattern) in particular hour and fractals right at the Tokyo open, then Market changed and consistency of those trades run down. Not sure how long back your setup is working, but Market could change and what was profitable few month back could be not profitable next or those patterns can move to different time. At least so far it looks OK.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
For anyone... By all means - experiment with this concept using calculations that are more comfortable for you. Either from the perspective of risk, or win percentage. Always stick with the premise of a large risk/reward ratio though.. Without aiming for a lot more than you risk, this system will definitely not work.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Wouldn't that be a *small* risk/reward ratio?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Oh, I fully expect the market to change at some point, and yes, I've tried to express to everyone reading to not bank on this being their "system", but rather one of their many tools. For me, it's a distraction to keep me busy between trades. I'm a long-term D1 and up trader. I need little things to kee me busy between my 3 or so trades per month By the way, 08:00GMT is the middle of the night for me too. Because of the simplicity of the entries, this is one of the rare cases where an EA actually does give you the same results you'd get manually. I do have the system automated, and my results are that of an EA. Roundrock also posted a link to an EA he created for this system at the beginning of page 5.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Small risk, large reward. Technically, yes - small ratio. Good catch

It's been bothering me that I haven't yet given Dreamliner a proper answer to his question about why I consider this gambling. I haven't been able to come up with a good analogy until now... Football.. So, first, we need to agree that if you place a bet on a football game, it's gambling. No matter the odds, any team can beat any other team on any given day. If you buy in to this, read on. If not, I'll try to find a better analogy. OK. You've done your research and found an edge. Your team has never lost when your starting QB has played against the other team's starting QB in good weather. Further, all season, the team with more rushing yards has won 80+ percent of the time, and your team has more rushing yards than your opponent. So, you have an "edge", and you place your bet. No matter the edge, you're still gambling. 45-seconds after the opening kickoff, it starts to snow. You had absolutely no control over this, it just happened. On your team's third play, your QB was hit, suffered a concussion, and your backup had to come play out the rest of the game. So, here's the analogy. The opening kickoff = your trade enters at 08:00GMT. The weather suddenly changing and your QB getting hurt are changes in the "market". Your anticipated outcome was based on things that happened in the past but have changed in real time. Everything that happened in the past that led up to your decision to bet the way you did means absolutely nothing now. This "system" makes no accommodation for real-time changes in the market. You are basing your entry, risk, and target on probabilities based on things that have happened in the past. Not entirely unlike when your system is entirely based on indicators that tell you what happened in the past. So we come full-circle, and maybe here's the first answer to DL's other question about how do you profit from your understanding of the market? Maybe it's not always profit - maybe the question is how do you protect from losses based on your understanding of the market? Well, what if you had a weatherman friend that could have told you with 100% certainty that it would start to snow early in the game? Knowing part of your decision to make that bet was based on previous performance in good weather, would you still have made the bet? So, in trading, that "friend" is your knowing that instead of the snow coming, there was an interest rate announcement coming. It's a sure thing - it's on the calendar - you just need to be aware that it's going to happen - total immersion... The big picture.... Maybe the announcement won't affect you, but why risk that it could? Why not wait until after the announcement to enter your trade, assuming the market conditions are still favorable to your anticipated position? One of many examples. I'll come up with more...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Very good illustration; but I'm still not sure I'd call it gambling, I might just call it "risk" which every legitimate business has. You never know what the future holds, and cannot be guaranteed that what you put your money on will bring back a profit. Still not convinced you are gambling .

--- 帖子 #120 ---
cgrey, Do you have an excel spreadsheet you could upload to make the working out easier??

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Not that would be of help to anyone but me. I can't possibly tell what your spread would be at the time of trades, nor would I know your account balance or other parameters specific to your situation. I'd suggest going through the thread again. There are several posts that fully explain the money management aspects. I can't make it any more clear/easier than the first post spells it out.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
If Cgrey gives me the authorization, i would answer you about the gambling matter. Someone said this system could work now but not next year, because market conditions could change , well here is the fundamental error, when someone says because , he thinks he knows something. The fact is: this system will work no matter what, since he is placing a stop to his loss and lettin go his profit to run, he will make money!. The problem is that people thinks about trading in a short time frames, people thinks about a system on a yearly basis, it doesn't work like that, let's think that we could trade this system for 1000 years it would make a profit 990 years, but 10 years (from 2000 to 2010) it would show a loss, well we would say this system doesn't work right? while the system would show a 99% possibility to show profits in a year!! To make an example in the real world: Let's say we are professional poTKer player, (poTKer card game is a poker game that i just invented, lol) PoTKer is very similar to hold em poker the only differences are: we don't have big blind so we can pass all the hands that we want without losing money, and people can't raise, so we can place our bet (our 2.5%) and we can wait until the last deck card is showed. Well we will play just when the cards shows us a ace's pair, so we could often have a ace's three of a kind. We are pretty sure we would make money in the long run, but think to play for a 1000 year how many times would you lose? and what would you do if you start playing during a losing period? if you follow me i would go further: other players doesn't always wait for a ace's pair, someone waits for ace and two, to have straight, someone for spades couple to have color and so on... all this people are BETTING they have no power on the cards, some trader prefers day trading, someone trend following... When you compare trading to other business you are making another mistake. Because: you can make a statistical research, if you open your shop in the north pole or in NY city it makes a lot of difference. You can merchandise on tv or newspaper your activity; and so on... there are thousand examples i can make. In the "real" world you have some power to change things, in poKTer you have no control over cards, in trading you have no power on the prices... Those are my thought and could be absolutely wrong, so feel free to criticize!! :-)

Nobody needs "authorization" to post here - feel free to share your thoughts. I don't necessarily agree, but you're certainly welcome to post your opinion. I think the general CONCEPT of this strategy - low risk, high reward - will always work, in terms of money management. Many succesful traders operate on this principle. However, blindly trading this specific system, exactly this way (at exactly 08:00GMT, entering based on the price in relation to 00:00GMT) will almost certainly change at some point. It remains to be seen. I stopped looking backwards beyond 2007, since I was comfortable enough with 4 profitable years. That was when I made the switch to forward testing as we're doing here. It's easy to look back and see how something WOULD HAVE worked after the fact. Now we need to see if it really WILL work in the present.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I really enjoy learning from a professional trader, thank you cgrey for your ongoing comments. I have a question about how the entry was developed. It seems that so far your comments, and other people's comments have centered around the risk reward and that "you will always make money" because you are cutting losers short and letting winners run. Then why don't we pick 0500GMT to 1300GMT with the same scenario (that way I could trade it when I'm awake instead of this system that I have to trade in my sleep ). Keep the same risk/reward and go! In other words, I'm thinking your timeframe has been tested for 3 years and that's why you feel a certain level of comfort trading it. But we could no doubt do the same thing for other timeframes too, right?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
It is all a matter of perspective, after all. I definitely understand your view on this.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Yes, and not to belabor the point, but if we take your example as "gambling" then all of life is a "gamble." I "gambled" that if I learned to fly there would be a job for me after all the money spent. Doctors gamble that after 16 years of medical school expenses a hospital will hire them. Truck drivers gamble that after going to truck driving school and purchasing the big rig there will be driving jobs available. Just thinking out loud. Again, not wanting to beat a dead horse nor take up your time, I just have an aversion to gambling and would rather call your system trading .

Not that it is an original but the description I like is Risk Management cheers

This will probably key you in to how immersed I am in my business (if you haven't thought about it already). I spend a lot of time looking at past charts. A LOT of time. I do this as part of what I call my "real" trading... A few weeks ago, I was looking through hourly G/U charts - I generally don't trade G/U, so this was sort of studying for me... And I just sort of noticed that it always seems like there's a pretty big candle each day at around the same time (I have period separators on, to help break up the days for me). So I started looking at that candle, and lo and behold, most days, that big candle was 08:00GMT. I also noticed that G/U seems to have a fairly common pattern of reversing itself (sometimes even more than once a day). And, guess what - this 08:00 candle is usually somewhere around that point, too. Now, of course, all of this makes perfect sense since 08:00GMT is London open and the GBP is half of this pair, so we could expect some sort of movement. So, I now know I get a pretty big candle here fairly often, and there is also a movement "the other way" somewhere around this candle fairly often. Hmm... I wonder what would happen if I "bet" on this candle (sorry, couldn't resist ) to move back toward the open of the current D1 candle (which is the same as the open of the 00:00GMT). And so on, and so on.... After a few hours, I came up with the money management, because playing this straight just wasn't working out, but I was still convinced there was a way to exploit it. I started trying to work 1:4 in to it, since that is always a target for me in manual trading. After some more time, running through this candle by candle, I found the point that I could say, if I apply another principle of money management (capital preservation) to this, and quit after a certain weekly (eventually settled on monthly) target was hit, I may be on to something. About 5-6 hours in total after seeing those big candles looking through charts, I was manually back testing what ended up in the first post, and found it profitable back to 2007. The kicker was when I started going fowrard from January 2011, and found that I was out with my +10% within 3-days. I don't think it would work at other times, because of those two specific factors. But I haven't tried it. I did wonder if other pairs, possibly even around the opening times of other markets, might work out. I still wonder that - but none of them jumped out at me just by looking at charts the way this did.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I really appreciate how you approach your trading truly as business, do your research, see if there are probabilities, develop appropriate risk/reward and good money-management techniques. You're thorough and professional. Nice job! (Better than rolling the dice, huh? Couldn't resist....)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Someone before said risk management. That's a good way to put it. Risk management is pretty much money management since it's our money we are risking. Since there is some debate about the definition of gambling, notice how the word risk and gamble are intertwined [BTW, I like the analogy of risk and life Dreamliner]. Anyway, I think the one thing we've all realized in our time trading is that the balance of risk/money management and seeking favorable probabilities is the key to succeeding. It's simple yet not so simple. I think where beginners begin to become better traders is when they learn to not only balance these two but also spot opportunites at the same time (and learn to have patience) . Patience comes from accepting losses and understanding that you will very likely get margin called if you have too high of a return expectation. I'd like to associate forex trading like balancing a basket of eggs on your head. Move too fast and eratically (inconsistent) and you will get egg on your face. Move steady and consistently and you will do okay.

Hello cgrey! I think you have more followers than you think. I know I have been following this. Unfortunately due to the time I am not able to trade this particular pair, however I am testing the method and money management part on other pairs. I will post a few things later when I have a little more time. For now I have to step away for a bit. Take care.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I'm not at all complaining that this thread isn't "busy'. In fact, I kind of like it this way - I don't want to have to spend all day in the forums, and I certainly have nothing to prove to anyone but myself. This method doesn't warrant a lot of discussion... There's no room for interpretation. Nobody has to worry about "did this RSI really cross" or "this indicator repaints". All you need to know is what time is it, is the current price higher or lower than it was 8 hours ago, and how much of the monthly target is left. When you have these three pieces, trade! The thread will always be here if there is a question or need to discuss. But I think it is definitely transitioning more to a journal to keep track of trades at this point.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Just a quick thank you Cgray. As a new trader (not even live yet) this thread has been very helpful. I have not and may not trade the pair that you are but your trading philosophy and MM topics have been very insightful.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I'm glad you've taken something from this, and that you are taking THE RIGHT things. There is a lot to learn should you choose to get serious about investing. Most importantly, though, is to develop a plan and keep at it. That said, you will likely spend your first year or more "chasing" the perfect system. You know it's out there... And as time goes on, you'll likely come to the realization that there is no such thing (perfect system). It's part of the learning process. But don't ever lose sight of your goals. Education is critical. Even if/when you find a system based on indicators that may work well for you, understand WHY it works, and don't just follow in blindly. You can and will achieve so much more success with a little knowledge beyond "buy when a green arrow appears and sell when a red one does"... Best of luck to you.

Hello cgrey. You are correct, you only have to prove to yourself, but I can tell you that you have gotten my admiration. I appreciate what you have shared thus far and look forward to checking in on this thread and seeing how the trades progress. I agree the thread is better when it's not busy. Makes it easy to follow and keep up to date - just like the strategy! Take care.

Hi cgrey, This is my first post on FF and the above quote is the reason. I have been a lurker here for a few years, and I really got into a thread on macro fundamentals by Razorjack here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=216097 I started reading the books he suggested, particularly Intermarket analysis by Ashrief Lidl (spelling off the top of my head) Trader Vic books, and The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Can you give me any pointers to any more books of this kind? You mentioned understanding the markets, but what I need are more resources so that I can understand. Are you willing to share any book titles, pdfs or websites? I am just beginning to appreciate the importance of different methods of money management. Did you come up with this method yourself, or can you give me any pointers to somewhere (book, website etc.) where ther are examples of different MM methods? I don't expect you to hold my hand, I realise that I must do the studying myself, but if you could maybe wave you're hand in the right direction, it would be much appreciated. Keep up the good work, and all the best for your trading in the future. Alan

Hi, The one book I have read (several times, and still refer to) that is specifically about trading is Mark Douglas' "Trading in the zone". I don't know if that was on the other thread's list (I didn't read the other thread). In your shoes, I would make one of the very first steps of my journey an economics class at your local community college. Aside from getting a fundamental understanding, if you have a knowledgeable professor, he or she can become a valuable resource to you. A good book to start (though very basic) is "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Global Economics" by Craig Hovey. This book will teach you absolutely nothing about trading, but will help you start to understand how the "big picture" works, and how economies in countries around the world impact each other. Websites... My day hasn't begun until I've had a look at marketwatch ( http://www.marketwatch.com/ ), and I generally read both the front page and "markets" page. I have also learned a tremendous amount right here a Forex Factory. But, lately it is harder and harder to find threads that are helpful. The "trading systems" section is probably NOT where you want to be, but rather "rookie discussion" and "trading discussion" are you best bet to find good information. "Trading systems" will lead you to one thread after another filled with charts loaded with indicators that you will learn absolutely nothing from (other than how to tell for sure if something is really red or green). The people starting the threads will often be "rookies" themselves, convinced that they've found the "holy grail" system, and want the world to know that they were the one who discovered the best thing ever. But you won't learn much more from them other than how great they think they are. Not in all cases, of course, but far more often than not. You'll quickly learn to spot those you can learn from and those that are just blowing their own horns by presenting their "system". Opinions will differ on this topic, but in my opinion at least, learning how to react when RSI moved up over 50 isn't something that will have a lot of value for you. But learning to watch for conditions in the markets that will impact currencies (which is where studying sites like marketwatch and watching your forex charts simultaneously) is what will make you successful. Hope this has helped at least a little.

Since I'm trading this automatically, yes, I trade any difference in price (even if it were 0.1 pip). Even if I were trading it manually, I'd do the same. That said, feel free to experiment - if you think it could improve results by only executing the trade if it is "x" pips different or higher, see how works out...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Yes, today was long and stopped out.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Now is probably also a good time to note... ALL of my opinions come from the perspective of trading for a living, not as a hobby. For some, many probably, it simply won't be possible to put in all the time and effort... Especially for those working full time jobs. I've mentioned several times that trading is a "business" (if you're doing it professionally). Business owners often work 12 / 14 / 16 hours a day. The same is true for "professional" traders. It can be very difficult to invest this kind of time when you have a full time job to worry about. I'm not at all suggesting anyone quit their job to start trading. But realize that most of what I've been running on about here has been from this perspective. For many, becoming a "really good" indicator trader, which still requires an investment of time (though not as intense) is the first step. Building confidence there will lead to that decision about going full-time later. For me, it wasn't as much of a choice. I found myself unemployed as a result of downsizing, and that was the opportunity I needed to put in my time. It probably wouldn't have happened (yet) had it not been for that.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Sorry I missed this part, Alan... I was actually dealing with getting my son ready for school while trying to respond. What we're doing for money management with this system is really nothing more than a hybrid of a couple of "best practices" as I like to think of them. Always have a higher reward than risk. Preferably a minimum of 1:2. I generally shoot for at least 1:4 in my trading, and I will absolutely NEVER enter a trade with less than a 1:2 potential. Also, always have a target, and stop when you reach it - also known as "Capital Preservation". Money management in my opinion, is not about "how much can I win". It is about how do I not lose, and if I have to lose, how do I minimize those losses. The best way to not lose is to not trade. So when my target is reached, I'm done. I apply that to some degree in my "real" trading as well, but it is a little more discretionary than I've laid it out for this particular system, because I feel it has to be. This system will have strings of winners and losers. We're capitalizing on hitting just a few winners in a row to get to our monthly target, and then we stop before those few losers in a row. Again, with this system really not being based on any true "market conditions", I personally have a lot less confidence in any individual trade - so we compensate for that with a low risk:reward factor, and minimize risk even further by quitting when we're ahead. We know from history that this candle is capable of producing 50/60/70 even 80 pips sometimes. So, by limiting our loss to 20, and taking the 50+ when we can get them, we get an advantage. But here also, we stop when this candle closes and take whatever we have. And the truth is, if we let it go and closed only at TP or SL, this system wouldn't work (failed miserably in my backtesting, in fact).

I've read the first page of this thread, and will devote some time this week to seeing more of it. He and I trade very similarly from what I've seen so far, and he seems is WAY better at "teaching" this and presenting it than I can ever hope to be. I wish I was able to properly present most stuff that is in my head. I will study some more, but for anyone who wants to get a general idea of how I am trading, have a look here. When I get caught up with it, I will probably share some thoughts in that thread.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I'm up to page 4 of the above-mentioned thread. It is pure gold. In my opinion, one of the top 10 (maybe even top 5) threads on the entire FF site. And the simillarities I've seen so far between him and myself are amazing - right down to parts of our background and overall philosophies. Funny, too, that this was right around the time I had made the switch to fulltime, and I was putting in so much time outside of FF that I had never discovered this thread. It would have been SOOOO helpful to me at the time, and there are still pieces of it today that have great value to me. I also "cheated" and looked at the last page just to see where things are today, and it seems the thread starter has left the building. I suppose I'll come to why in the next few pages, and I hope it doesn't end up being like so many others and start deteriorating in to battles between members instead of constructive conversation. Whatever the case - go read the first few page of this thread now. If you're serious about going this route with your trading, it will be hard to find more valuable information. Thanks for directing us to it, Alan!

Do you think there is any merit in changing the 8h00 GMT bar to the 9h00 GMT on 27 March 2011 when daylight savings begin in England? My thinking is that the London markets will open later by an hour and therefore the increased volume should commence an hour later. Can Roundrock or any of the other guys who have run back tests for a few years confirm if the performance during the months of April through to Oct were any different?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
My backtests were always done on the 08:00GMT candle, regardless of any local time changes. I will be leaving it as-is, but if anyone tries changing to 09:00, I'm sure some folks may be interested in your results.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Well... I thought about this, and now I'm not so sure.... I use IBFX for my charting and demo accounts. My testing of this has always been with THEIR 08:00 candle. It just so happens, since discovering this, they've been on GMT. I'll need to confirm, but actually, I probably DO change with the time change, since I am working off broker time....

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I think the broker time in this case is always GMT and that they don't change to synchronize with the daylight savings of the various regions. Therefore during Apr to Oct the GMT &amp; London times are different by 1 hour.... the other times it is equal. If the back tests don't reveal a definite difference then the timing is obviously not so sensitive, but on the other hand, if there is a difference then this might give us an answer.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I have confirmed with IBFX that their platform is always GMT, regardless of their local time zone. So, my backtesting has always been 08:00GMT, and never adjusted by an hour for any local time changes. I will stick with this philosophy come March, and continue to trade the 08:00GMT candle.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
It's obviously prudent to test a method or strategy before going live, however, testing also has it's drawbacks. For me, the bad thing about forward testing is finding that after a few months the method is profitable and you could have made all that money! Haha. I'm just joking. Forward testing is important and allows you to practice and get in the habit of using the method and fine tuning it. Seriously now, one thing that I do (if I find a method that has backtested succesfully over many months) is I use my live Oanda account which allows me to trade nano-size lots (100 units). I do this for a couple reasons. First, if I'm going to spend time doing something I might as well try to make something albeit penny per pip. And if I lose money it isn't enough to sting bad. I've also heard that demo accounts may be set up a little different than real accounts. Now the difference is probably negligible, if any, but I want to get as close to the real thing as possible. Why not if the risk is only penny per pip?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Definitely a good plan. I do a similar thing - I usually set up a separate account with a small balance just for the one strategy/system. Allows me to keep stuff like this separate. In this case, though, I'm not sure I'd even want to put $5k at risk with this system, which is what the minimum account size with my broker is. And since I trade it by robot, I'd have to convert it over to tradestation (which in this case would be simple enough). I have used OANDA in the past, and they're supposedly going to be offering MetaTrader later this year. That may be a good time to go live with it, and I'd just keep running it in demo until then.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
oanda practice account has MT4, I have loaded this. after fixing the issues from practice accounts they may go LIVE

--- 帖子 #170 ---
...

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Do you have to be currently "live" with them to get an MT4 practice account? It may be worth setting up in advance if there's a way to get one. I'd be willing to try it and move this strategy to it for February (concurrently with the IBFX demo it is currently in), in preparation to take it live maybe by March. Seems like the best of both worlds..

Thanks for your reply, The one book I have read (several times, and still refer to) that is specifically about trading is Mark Douglas' "Trading in the zone". I've read that and "The Disciplined Trader" by Mark Douglas and they are both great, the last section of "Trading in the Zone" really made 'having an edge' come alive for me. A good book to start (though very basic) is "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Global Economics" by Craig Hovey. This book will teach you absolutely nothing about trading, but will help you start to understand how the "big picture" works, and how economies in countries around the world impact each other. You should read some of the books mentioned in Razorjacks thread. The book be Ashraf Laidl (proper spelling ) is very good at explaining how most of the different markets interact. Websites... My day hasn't begun until I've had a look at marketwatch ( http://www.marketwatch.com/ ), and I generally read both the front page and "markets" page. I also try and keep up with Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ, FT etc. for news, but particularly for signs of sentiment extremes. I have also learned a tremendous amount right here a Forex Factory. There are some great threads here. J16, No Brainer, Trading with deadly accuracy, DIBS, Trading with limit orders ............ But, lately it is harder and harder to find threads that are helpful. The "trading systems" section is probably NOT where you want to be, but rather "rookie discussion" and "trading discussion" are you best bet to find good information. "Trading systems" will lead you to one thread after another filled with charts loaded with indicators that you will learn absolutely nothing from (other than how to tell for sure if something is really red or green). The people starting the threads will often be "rookies" themselves, convinced that they've found the "holy grail" system, and want the world to know that they were the one who discovered the best thing ever. But you won't learn much more from them other than how great they think they are. Not in all cases, of course, but far more often than not. You'll quickly learn to spot those you can learn from and those that are just blowing their own horns by presenting their "system". Yes I agree completely, which is one of the reasons I have never posted before. Opinions will differ on this topic, but in my opinion at least, learning how to react when RSI moved up over 50 isn't something that will have a lot of value for you. Maybe I wasn't clear in my first post. I have been trading for maybe 3 years, and have lost some money (not a lot) using indicators and all that crap. I am a big fan of Sam Seiden from FXStreet. Always have a higher reward than risk. Preferably a minimum of 1:2. I generally shoot for at least 1:4 in my trading, and I will absolutely NEVER enter a trade with less than a 1:2 potential. Also, always have a target, and stop when you reach it Sam Seiden, or you can also leave 10 to 20% to run (TV or Kathy Lien's book Millionaire Traders) "Capital Preservation". Money management in my opinion, is not about "how much can I win". It is about how do I not lose, and if I have to lose, how do I minimize those losses. Trader Vic separates it into 3 parts 1/ Capital preservation 2/ Consistent returns 3/ The opportunity to make superior returns I work most days, but can maybe check the computer first thing in the morning and at lunchtime, while i can spend more time in the evening doing analysis. Because of this I usually only trade daily or higher timeframes, so waiting for A+ trades to come along needs patience. This is why I was browsing this thread, as you say, for a distraction. I'm always on the look out for simple mechanical systems. I liked the look of the 'Big Dog' opening breakout syatems, but the R:R wasn't there, and while the idea made sense, the system didn't. I had also noticed this (or these) candles on GBPUSD, and I reckon price is retracing to the previous day's supply / demand level, so speculators can buy / sell at wholesale prices if they've missed the move in their own time zone. I was looking at the problem from a different angle and then I stumbled across this thread, and what you want to makes sense to me. As for my trading I'm at the point of not losing much and having runs of consistency. A while to go yet, but I'm in no rush. I want to take my time and do it properly. Before I go, another reason I posted here on this thread for the first time, was because I thought you might be Razorjack because of what you were saying about the big picture. All the best with the testing I'll be following the thread and your journal with interest. I live and work in China, while the inernet connection is usually good, it can be intermitent sometimes so I don't know if I can use the EA myself. Keep up the good work and I wish all the best in your trading. You said you were made redundant, sometimes I think that would give me the push that I need. Not for now though. Check out some of these books. They will help your study, and also be another distraction. Sorry for the long reply Later Alan

--- 帖子 #174 ---
google 'oanda forums', then there is a thread on this MT4. you can get link to download MT4 and instructions to install, link to your practice account. you need either practice/game account or trade/live account to login to mt4. right now practice account is fine. good thing is they allow units. min lotsize is 1000 units.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
even though its addressed to cgrey, i will try to add my 2 cents... how you tested this ? using EA or manually ? this is what i would suggest. first downlaod GBPUSD 1 min historical data for last 3 years. manually check each day. create a indicator to put 2 vertical lines of diff colors at 0 GMT and 8 GMT. now each day manually check the entry, exit prices and log to a excel, let excel do the math. stop that month if u reach 10% profit this is timetaking, but accurate

--- 帖子 #176 ---
As roundrock before said, I'll add my 2 cents before cgrey answers. cgrey said he looked back to about 2007 and that he noticed a pattern between the candles at certain times (0 and 8 GMT). He also said that on average, the 20 pips stop loss was hit about 5 times a month and most times the trade was still open at the 9 GMT close time. Did you actually check the price at 9 GMT on every trade? Then did you take the result and calculate the next days profit target based on a 2.5% 20 pip stop? Seems like a lot of number crunching and time consumption (unless you used an EA). With that said, I can easily see someone backtesting this and making mistakes. It appears much easier to forward test. Let's see where it takes us.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Just to add to daylight saving time in uk come march, it seems to me the reason this candle does what it does is because it is the open of uk session. Now when daylight saving starts london market will open at 8am but that is really 7am GMT.So if cgrey uses his 8am candle on his broker market in london will already have been open for an hour.

+10.3 pips today (1.08%) For Monday: Target: 6.92% r:r = 1:2.768 TP target = 56 pips Monday will be the last trade for January, and the last results I post in this thread. A journal thread to track progress will be opened. I will catch up with replies a little later this morning...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I believe a couple of people have already responded to help you figure out how to backtest it. Mine was done manually with a spreadsheet. My "result" was that this was profitable back through the beginning of 2007.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I started making some notes about books I'd like to check out as I skimmed through it. Truth be told, I've not read a whole lot of books, and have taken a more hands-on approach, but I definitely will try to check a few of these out. Nothing at all wrong with that approach. The markets will still be here tomorrow, next week and next year. And you are clearly on the right path. When I started reading his thread, I thought I was too A LOT of what he posted in the first few pages really hit home with me, he just seems to be able to present it much better than I could hope to. Best thing that could have ever happened, though it didn't seem like it at the time... Nor would I recommend it to anyone. Definitely will. Best of luck to you as well. It's good to see that there are people out there like yourself that are really taking the right approach if they want to achieve success. There's no doubt in my mind you will continue to be successful.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thanks roundrock. I am going to try to get an MT4 demo set up with them today. That'll give me a chance to run it side-by-side in Februrary with the one I have going at IBFX now and make sure they produce similar results. I also have to be certain I understand how they're implementing MT4. Appreciate you pointing me in the right direction...

--- 帖子 #184 ---
This is how I did it - almost exactly to the detail.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The other thing to take in to account is to watch for the high/low of the 08:00 candle to be sure TP or SL wasn't hit. Even if the close is 12 pips against you, if at any point during that candle it went to -20, that would have been a stop. Same for TP... Yes, it was tedious to do manually, and yes, forward testing should help us determine if things will continue the way they have...

--- 帖子 #186 ---
It looks like you were one candle early. That was the 07:00GMT candle.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
THank you all. I downloaded historical data with data accuracy 90%. I tested using EA. maybe this is the problem, I did not change the time, some months we have to consider DST i think. This could be the problem.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Logically, this makes sense. That said, back to 2007, my results have all been based on the 08:00GMT candle, regardless of whether it was daylight or standard time. So, I will be pushing forward continuing to use 08:00GMT. For anyone that would rather switch with DST, feel free to try what you're more comfortable with.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Just got on board. Looks like you hit the monthly goal today! If I'm doing it right 3 hrs after the 8 hr candle it was up about 60 an hour later it spiked up about 90 from the 8 hr candle Too bad shutting down the thread. I will follow your journal. You also make some very intelligent comments about the market. I'm many steps behind where you are but I agree about reacting to the market and look for potential moves based on financial conditions globally I'm going to see if I can play around and get a spread sheet to do the calcs although not that hard to figure manually

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I believe you close the trade at 9 GMT. Therefore it would of never made it that far. On a day like today it seems bad to close after one hour, but it can also prevent your profit from going back to negative if the market turns againt you.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi dryclean, We always close the trade if it remains open at 09:00. So, no, we didn't hit the goal today, but we did collect about 10 pips toward it. The thread isn't going anywhere. I'll just be moving "results" to a journal to keep the topic about discussion. Being as simple a system as it is, there really isn't a lot of discussion. The entries and exits are clearly defined, and there's no interpretation about whether something crossed, or "did I read this right". So, discussion hasn't been as busy as some other "system" threads, and that's fine with me But in any case, I'm not closing the thread - just moving future results out of it. I had a post earlier that really simplified the calculation. While it would be only very slightly less accurate (mostly due to compounding), the easiest way to go is to simply set your monthly target to 80 pips and stop when you're at +80 for the month. Just make sure your SL is always 20, and you don't change your lot size during the course of the month, and recacluate at the start of the next month. When you hit +80pips you will be right around +10% for the month - assuming, of course, that you had accurately calculated 2.5% of your balance to be worth 20-pips at the start of the month. Good luck. Hopefully it will provide another tool for people to use.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
OK I see where I went wrong. Duh! Will be following Yes and the 80 pips 20SL makes it very simple

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks again roundrock for making me aware of Oanda 's MT4. I managed to get a practice account set up today, so I can run this parallel with them in Februrary to be sure it is doing the same thing as the IBFX demo I ran this month. This also got me thinking more about starting the journal thread.... The point of my posting results in this thread has been to make sure people can see how I'm doing the math every day. I think there are enough examples that it should be pretty clear by now. The link I've posted in the first post to the myfxbook tracking site for this system contains every trade, past, present and future and is updated in nearly real-time. So, I'm really wondering if a journal here is necessary at all. I'll have to ponder that one. It's not as though I'd have any analysis or other thoughts contributing to how I arrived at placing any trade. On a positive note, what we've done here so far with one trading day left in January is the second time around this month for this system. Starting from the first actual trading day of the month (January 3rd), we would have been out with our 10% four days later and had a pretty boring month, having hit our target so soon. No matter what happens on Monday, we will still end up positive for all the rest of the trades in the month that we would have never even made. The worst we can do Monday would be a 2.5% loss, and we're currently up 3.08% since I started recording trades on 12-January. It also just dawned on me that we're now almost 200 posts in to a "system" thread, and there hasn't been a single screen shot or attachment posted. That's got to be a record here, and one that I couldn't be happier about Anyway - that's about it for me for the weekend. I may check in once in a while, but I won't likely be spending much time behind the PC, so it may be a while before I reply to anything addressed specifically to me. Have a good weekend all!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hello cgrey. Hello all. Let us hope for a good week of profits. One thing I like about Oanda's regular platform (not metatrader) is you can set SL to 2.5% and then adjust units so that you can make it 20 pips = 2.5%. All the calculations are done in the order window before you place the order. Same goes for TP. Makes it easy.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi cgrey, Sorry if this question has already been asked but if we set monthly target wouldn't it be reasonable to set monthly stop-loss as well? Roundrock mentioned there was at least 2 losing month in 2010. One of them is more then 10% drowdawn, so it will be more than a month to recover

--- 帖子 #196 ---
cgrey, we did end up on positive day. i think journal is a good way to concentrate more and fix any mistakes. atleast for 1 or 2 months. then it becomes redundant. especially if we are going LIVE, journal is needed. i am planning to go LIVE with 5% monthly target and 1.25% , 20 pip SL i am waiting for someone to upload a nice excel for this

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Sure - if you're going to trade this, do what is comfortable for you. What I've presented is an idea. Trade it how you are most comfortable with it.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Yeah, it's too bad you can't do this with their MT also, but I'm certain that's a MetaTrader thing, not necessarily something OANDA can control. But yes, I do like this too. I had a live account with OANDA a while back - this was one of the things I liked about them.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
We took 27-pips today, for a gain of a little over 2.85% When all is said and done for January, we closed with a net gain of 6% since I started recording trades. This is on top of hitting the +10% target earlier in the month before I started logging. Some stats: Opening balance: $3000 Closing balance: $3180.11 ROI: +6% Our lowest point of the month was 18-January, where we were at -4.59%. I'm still on the fence about a journal thread, again because the myfxbook link serves as a nice journal already.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
sorry but I can't understand, todays situation 0:00 open on 1.5831 8:00 open 1.5874 so we need to buy on 9:00 we have 1.5829 so we lose 20p

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I think the myfxbook link is great on its own. i can just see whats going on and compare my own trades - will be giving this a go live from tomorrow. Big thanks for the method, as one trade a day suits me beautifully

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Just come to say: Congrats!! hope many many months will fall after with these (and better) results!!

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Start small if you're going to go live - we still haven't proven this forward for very long.... I'm thinking along the same lines - the myfxbook page is a good journal. Would probably feel differently if there was some analysis or other commentatry that went with each trade, but I really don't know if there's any need for more than a record of every trade and the result.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Good idea to keep risk low. You're basically cutting everything in half. Just figure out 1.25% divided by the 20-pip stop and use that for your lot size all month. Keep a running total of pips gained or lost, and quit when you're at +80 - that will be right around your 5%.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thanks Beman. I hope so, too. Time will tell. Will probably open a small live account with OANDA as soon as they make MT4 available to live accounts. I need to run this automated, since I'm asleep at 08:00, so MT4 is a must for me.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
When 08:00 open is higher than 00:00 open, we SELL. When 08:00 open is lower than 00:00 open, we BUY. So, today was not a buy, it was a sell.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
yep, my fault, I've reread first post. Thanks for help

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I agree. I think fxbook is good enough and better than a thread. cgrey and anyone else interested in Oanda's MT4, in case you were wondering, it is to my understanding that the minimum trade size is 1000 units (.01 lots). Unlike their other platform you cannot trade nano size (100 units). As I said before I prefer to trade penny per pip when forward testing a strategy as opposed to demo. If you're looking to test or take it live with Oanda MT4, the minimum trade size is 10 cents/pip. Not alot, but not to my liking for testing.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
.10 / pip means 2.00/day max loss... So, that would mean a starting balance of $80 ($2 is 2.5% of 80). I should be ok. If/when I'm ready to go live to further test this, I'd probably give it about $1000 to make it worthwhile, so I'd be in the neighborhood of $1.25 / pip. But yes, anyone else may want to be looking for a broker that will do nano lots.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Those bad at math might understand better: 0000 open is Lower ---- Sell 0000 open is Higher --- Buy

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hello Cgrey, thanks for this system and everything you ve been posting, I also backtested manually with great results, so I'm going Oanda live tomorrow (small account) Just one question, I ve noticed that in your fxbook the SL that appears is 30 pips away from the opening price, if I am reading it correctly. Kind regards and happy trading Arkpip

I'm still thinking the myfxbook link will suffice for a journal. So, rather than post results every day for February, I think everyone gets it by now. I'm still here for comments and discussion, and I'll probably post a summary now and then. Starting balance in the demo for Februrary will be $3180.11 Monthly target of 10% is $318.01. Good luck to those of you who mentioned you're going live.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi cgrey, congrats, great thread! I will trade your system on one of my live accounts starting tomorrow with a balance of 1000 €. My monthly target will also be 10% (100 €). Cheers and good luck to everyone, Oliver

Good luck, Oliver. I hope it hits 10% early for you (and the rest of us)

Hi guys!! I like the concept of this thread...so I made a quick backtest using Strategy Trader (more professional than MT4 in backtests).... First of all I have to say that, at a first glance...the strategy seems profitable, anyway I found slighly different settings that perform better. cgrey feel free to delete this posts if it's not of interest Ok...so what I used in this backtest? (I hope I found the right GMT times because the platform uses EDT times) Starting Capital 1000$ Lots per trade 0,10 (1 minilot) There is no %R position sizing or compounding in order to make all more simple, but if you consider compounding..the performance can be much better.... Open of the 08:00 GMT candle but compared to open of 06:00 GMT candle (NOT 00:00 GMT)...I choose this because 1 year backtest gave the best results. I did not stop trading after 10% monthly goal...this backtest trades every day of the month (because coding a stop at 10% is too complicated at the moment). 1 Trade per day, 20 pips SL and 80 pips TP maximum taken at the open of 08:00 GMT and closed at the open of 09:00 GMT Here are some screenshots... You can see that the data are positive, the equity is rising, and if you watch Monthly Returns, you can see that every month there is a runup above 10%, but it seems that stopping at 10% is not the best choice because many months the performance is way better....I think 20% can be a better monthly goal... Hope this is useful

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Great stuff Chris - thanks for sharing. This is exactly what I was going for when presenting this.... The CONCEPT is to focus on the money management and probabilities. You took that concept and applied it to a different set of "rules" and found something that works. Good work. What isn't as easy to tell from the screenshots (maybe it is and I just can't see it), is how much of the drawdown each month came after the theoretical 10% would have been hit. This, to me, is where finding the balance pays off. Yes, there were many months that returned more than 10%. And nearly every month ran up over 10% but ended up less.. But, in the end, I'm personally pretty happy with stopping at 10% gain. I won't find many other places that can return 100% + on my investment year after year. And it takes away a lot of the "what if" factor - "what if I'd have closed it out when I was up 10%"... For me, the best way to not lose is to not trade, which is why I set the rule for myself to stop when +10% is hit each month. But again, as I've been saying all along - take this and turn it in to something that works (better) for your taste. Looks like you've done just that - congrats!

chris, great data and analysis. can you do same analysis for years 2009, 2008 ? when i optimized with MT4 each year i got different set of numbers. so i stick to the original post. in 2010 may be GMT6 is good but in 2009 may be GMT04

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Chris, yeah this is very helpful. I was wondering the same thing about the money management. While I understand why Cgray would want to stop at 10%, It seems that to keep a good risk to reward ratio it is unwise to stop at 10%. I was going to run the same test but as I am a Noobie to all of this I hadn't figured out how. Thanks for saving me the time.

Hi cgrey, I feel like such a newb for asking this, but I was wondering how you calculated your lot size from knowing the following (details of your account on myfxbook): 50:1 Leverage $3000 Opening Balance We want to use only 2.5% of our Balance That 2.5% equals our 20 pips SL I have been going nuts trying to calculate the lot size, please help? Thanks, the-game.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi!! I will do....my first backtest has been very quick so is better if I go deeper in my tests... One thing to notice is that in my backtest I'm not using the 2,5% position sizing and compounding, so what you see are the monthly results without compounding, what does it mean? It means that the first month the percentage is "real", but the following months the percentage is calculated on the "initial capital" and not on the "actual capital", so the percentage is "less" that in reality. Anyway I did not run the backtest to have real numbers and real percentage...but just to have an idea if the strategy is overall profitable or not...and it seems it is... I will do more tests...but I have to implement something in my code.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
2.5% of $3000 is $75 $75 divided by 20-pips = $3.75 per pip. The rest depends on whether your account uses nano, mini or standard lots. In my case, I have standard lots (1 lot = $10), so it becomes roughly 0.37 lots (slightly different due to spread and daily compounding).

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks cgrey, seems I was thinking too hard about that one

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Today, if we went long instead of short as per the rules, we would have made our 10% for the month already Today's trade went the other way for 80 pips! Same thing on the 25th Jan. Looks like Money Management IS the system... very clever cgrey

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Not quite. The 08:00 candle opened at 1.6054 and closed at 1.6058. We would have taken 4 pips instead of losing 7, but the big move didn't come until the 09:00 candle, when we would have already been out.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
No problem. We humans tend to over-complicate things

--- 帖子 #228 ---
My comprehension is getting worse as I get older, which is a bad thing! When you say taken 4 pips, you meant lost 4 pips, since were supposed to go short today?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I just had one of those "how could I have not thought of this before" moments... Triggered by something the-game said earlier, but I can't believe it took until now to this of this. I hate to add any complexity, but I have a fairly simple change to make that is all upside with no additional risk. I have some morning routine stuff to take care of (I have to get my son ready and take him to school, and then watch the NYSE open - can't abandon my regular trading, after all).... But I will be back later this morning to spell this all out.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hi....I made new backtests today... Unfortunately I can't go before August 2009 because I have some missing data.... Anyway...I found that the best results come with comparing the 08:00 GMT candle to 01:00 GMT candle This is obviously an optimization...so the "perfect" setting doesn't exists... I tried also to put a 80 pips goal every month and what I found is that most months the target is achieved, and there are just 2 losing months from 08/2009. The drawdown is very little (11,02%) In any case the best overall results (in money) come without the daily target, because some months the gain is much more than 80 pips. I'm not seeking perfection with backtests, because they are always optimized and they can not perform the same in the future...but what I can say for sure is that this strategy is viable and makes money. Only a forward test can tell us the truth. Here is a screenshot of the monthly results... Ignore the % profit because it's calculated every month on the current capital, and not the initial capital (1000$). Money Profit is what you need to watch for, 1$ is 1 pip. Some months the profit is more than 80$ because my backtest doesn't recalculate the target every day. Again...this is not compounded, it's just a linear backtest, imagine compounding and the results will be way better... Anyway the results are positive..this is what matters...

I cant wait...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
same here

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I'm going to take a guess and say he'll suggest opening a trade in both directions. You split the risk into both trades (1.25% each - in case they both whipsaw into your stop). You would do this in hopes of catching the big candle, which will effectively be more than your 20 pip stop. Of course due to negating trades, it may (or may not) take longer to reach the monthly profit target, but it should increase the probability of overall profitability. I thought about this, but didn't bring it up earlier to not add 'complexity' to the thread.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I rarely have that effect on people, can't wait to see what you've thought up. I think 2+2=4x is on the right track

--- 帖子 #235 ---
It's never a good thing to do anything that requires thought until you're fully awake. Coffee and a short drive can quickly bring the brain back to reality... I'll share my "big idea", and I'll also share why after some rational thought, it won't work. Well, it COULD, but it would be rare that the outcome would be any different than what we do today. The concept was to basically analyze where we are at the 09:00 candle open, and decide whether or not to exit instead of exiting automatically. If we were down, we'd exit to cut our losses, if we were up, we'd stay in the trade, moving the stop to the close of the 08:00 candle. If we were to reverse during the 09:00 candle, the worst position we'd be in would be the same as if we closed out with the 08:00 candle close. Then, reality hit... If the very first tick of the 09:00 candle goes against us, we're out. So, the only way this change would make any difference is if we caught the 09:00 candle open right at a point that it is in a move and not reversing. 09:00 would have to be a candle that the open was the extreme, and price never crossed back over the open price. Possible, but uncommon. Like I said - it took the brain a little while to realize that. Then I started thinking about "well, if we're up by 10 pips, maybe be willing to give back 5 to see if the gain continues... and so on....". And I quickly came to the conclusion that something like the latter would be a radical change to the underlying system itself. Plus, I am not in the habit of giving anything back - even if we only gave 2 pips back, do that a few times a month and it could mean the difference between a winning month and a losing month. Maybe someone else will want to take this concept and work with it. For me, after giving it more thought, I'm sticking with the original plan. So, sorry for the false alarm. I'll make sure I've had my coffee before coming up with any more bright ideas

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I'm in the US, and since I can't use a foreign broker, I can't open trades in opposite directions (within the same account, anyway). For that reason, I never really gave this any thought. I wouldn't expect it to work, but I can be proven wrong should anyone experiment with this. EDIT: here's why I won't expect it to work.... Most days, we close the trade somewhere between SL and TP. If you're in both ways, evey day (except the day you hit target) is a loser. Your trades cancel each other out (+5 and -5, for example), but you'll still pay spread and/or commission.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Well... It was more that when you pointed out those specific dates that I realized the 9:00 candle will sometimes continue the move that started with the 8:00. That got me on the track...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I was going to add it might be close half the position at 9 GMT and move stop up, but we probably would of picked up on the 9 GMT candle not reversing by now. I agree, it's best to keep it the way it is, which is nice and simple.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Chris - there are a few things that confuse me about the results.. For example, some months only show 5 or 7 or 8 trades. Are you doing anyhting to filter some trades out? There should be one trade every day. That would be in the neighborhood of 20-24 per month, depending on how weekends fall...

--- 帖子 #240 ---
When you see only 5 or 7 trades is because the 80 monthly pips are reached (your 10% for example) so the strategy stops to trade until next month... It's 1 trade per day until it reaches the target (in some case it exceeds the target)...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Ah, OK. Thanks for clearing that up. I wasn't sure if you were just letting it continue to run, based on your earlier comment that it seemed to work out better not stopping at a set target. Good stuff here.... Though, I also personally believe that backtests can only tell us so much, and from your comments, I think you tend to agree. Don't get me wrong, I usually backtest things too, though I almost always go manually even though it's time-consuming and tedious. For me, a rule of thumb is to do about 3-years worth of backtests. If something isn't clearly profitable (like 3% + per month), I usually either give up on it, or if I really believe it can work, I'll try to improve it. After it makes that first cut, I move to "stage 2", which is where I consider us here - forward testing (still in demo). I know some folks have mentioned they're going live with small accounts... That's usually "stage 3" for me. I like to have at least a few months of forward-tested demo before I risk anything, no matter how small... Just my style, I suppose. But again, thanks for putting the time in to this. I'm looking forward to any further findings you have...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Yes...I know what you are saying and I agree!! For what I can see from backtests the 10% monthly target is achieveable quite every month (not always but enough times) so the strategy is worth a massive forward test...we can't see in the future unfortunately...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Sorry... Just reviewing. This is generally a slow point of the day for me. You may have already figured this out... Yes, had we gone long today, we would have been +4 pips (not hit our target, since we close at 09:00). That would have been incorrect. We went short based on our "rules", and ended up -7.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
By the way - you broke our long string of posts in a "system" thread without any attachments or screenshots. But, the QUALITY of the screenshots makes up for it...

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Myfxbook is no longer able to track Oanda fxtrade as of today which really stinks in my opinion. When contacted about this, Oanda replied they are rolling out a new API and intend to eventually release it to third party websites "including Myfxbook". Let's see.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hmm... I didn't know they ever could. I guess I just assumed myfxbook only worked with MT4. I haven't been live with OANDA for a little over a year now. I had a small live account with them before I formed my corporation. Never used them for demo until now, mostly because I wanted MT for charting. That said, I will probably go live with them for this system (on the MT4 platform) when they make it available to fxtrade live accounts. Not sure I would have ever linked up a live account there or anywhere else to myfxbook. Sort of makes it 'public record', and I'd frankly rather keep what I report as my income from forex between me and Uncle Sam....

--- 帖子 #247 ---
OandA is only rolling out MT4 with demo accounts last I heard

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yea you used to be able to track Oanda's FXtrade on Myfxbook. They were the only non-MT4 broker on Myfxbook. Starting today it's only MT4.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Yeah. I think there's mixed info out there about that... I had heard demo accounts first, then live accounts in a month or two. If that ends up being the case, I'm good with that - I want to stay in demo with this at least through February. By April, I will need to find an alternate solution if OANDA isn't rolling out MT to live accounts yet - assuming, that is, that things are still positive with this system by then.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
cgrey, Thanks for this fun and clear-cut strategy to trade. Your entry method is somewhat reminiscent of the "Big Ben Strategy" in that oftentimes the Frankfurt market (07:00 GMT) takes price in one direction, and that direction is reversed with the London market open an hour later. It might be interesting to use the Frankfurt open in the same manner as the 00:00 open. Maybe you've already tested for that? I'm also wondering if there is any correlation with success regarding small vs large pip differences in the 00:00 and 08:00 open prices? It would seem that very small pip differences in the open prices might be indicating some sort of market indecision (ranging market)? I haven't tested for this, but it may prove worthwhile. For example, we may elect to decline a trade if the open prices are say &lt; 3 pips apart. If we trade those very close opens, it may end up looking more like a coin toss than a strategy. Good trading! BC2

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi BC2, I have not personally tested with candles other than the 08:00 and 00:00, but earlier today and yesterday, Chris_B mentioned that he had discovered some other possibilities in candle times that may work a little better. Don't know if he's specifically tested the comparison between 08:00 and 07:00, but he did suggest earlier that he'd be looking at some other parameters for continued testing. This actually was suggested earlier on by someone a few pages back. Or, if not actually "suggested", "wondered out loud" sort of as you have. I have to be honest - I've personally not tested any variations after having settled on what is in post #1... Maybe it's laziness on my part, but I guess my thought process was, if I can hit the 10% monthly target at least 80% of the time (which is about what has happened since 2007 in my testing), that's "good enough" and I haven't really had the desire to spend a lot of time improving on that. Having said that, I have and will continue to encourage people throughout the discussion to play around with this and see if some of their thoughts would improve the system to their liking. If I were going to invest some more time in looking for improvements (and I may still...) this concept of how close the two prices are would probably be the first area I explored...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Couple of losses in a row now which in my opinion is a good thing when forward testing as it gives us a chance to see what could happen when trading this for real, and how a few losses will effect us and how to deal with these emotionally. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #253 ---
There will be losses.... I've had as many as 9 in a row (though not all to SL) during the first round of testing. But yes, it is important to be able to handle them... For anyone looking for a no-loss system, you won't find it here, so be prepared....

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I missed this line in my first reply... We had a brief discussion about "gambling" several pages back. For the record, in my mind, this system really is closer to a coin-toss that a strategy (as you say). I make no effort to convince anyone otherwise. We have a little edge based on probabilities, but yea, there's nothing "technical" or "fundamental" about our entries (or exits). We close an hour after opening, for example, but we don't react at all to anything during that hour the way some traders would to market conditions with their open positions. Hell, we'll even trade this directly in to support or resistance if the price difference between the candles tells us to. For those that are able to trade it manually, they may want to experiment with putting some logic to it ... I know I would if I were hoping to really count on this as part of my income stream. In reality, when I'm ready to take it live myself, it will be for a few extra bucks a month. I'll give it enough of an account that it may generate enough cash for a few dinners out or some new DVDs, but not enough to risk it really cutting in to my "real" trading income when it has a bad month.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Newbie and first time poster here, A friend of mine picked up on this opening behaviour for the cable, but never came up with a method to trade it as efficiently. I think you're absolutely right in your treatment of the strategy. The MM side looks to me like a 'modified martingale' whereby you're increasing the risk and gain on a negative trade. The 10% target per month is maybe more for psychological benefit than anything else. It all boils down to the probability edge. If you don't mind me asking, from your backtesting what success probability have you seen? I'm looking to backtest the strategy but with a modified MM: 1) to increase risk size according to overall proability of success (if &gt;50%), 2) rather than close out the trade based on time/TP, have a trailing stop. Thanks for sharing, ManAboutTao

--- 帖子 #256 ---
This is absolutely NOT a martingale strategy. We are not increasing risk after any losing trades. Every single trade is a static 2.5% risk. Every year since 2007 has been profitable in my backtesting - which is as far as I went back. When I do backtest, I do it manually, so I don't generate statistics, other than to generally satisfy the question in my own mind if it is worth forward testing. Forward testing is where I will have statistics, which to date, is for one month. January 2011 hit 10% before I started logging trades here, and has returned an additional 6% since then. The first two days of February both went against us - one for 7 pips and the other stopped out. Down 3.43% so far for the month.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
We should add martingale and overtrading! Haha, just joking. I have to admit, the martingale concept is tempting though. I personally like martingale, but not in it's traditional sense. By 'traditional sense' I mean always try to profit the original target. To me that is dangerous. Some people even try doubling up, which is really insane. With that said, I do not advocate martingale type systems nor am I suggesting this system incorporate it in any way. Quite frankly I don't know why I even brought it up. I guess just for discussion purposes. I would like to take this opportunity to again say I think this is a nice simple method. Once again thanks to cgrey. More so for the money management approach, but also the method of comparing the two candles and then combining the two. Isn't it funny how we try to always improve something or are trying to find a way to make it better. I'm not saying that's a bad thing because sometimes that does lead to the discovery of something better. However, sometimes the best way is the one right in front of you.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I am a firm believer that money management is the most important aspect, and can take even a mediocre system and make it a winner. I'm all for improvements. But to some degree, I also think that is a personal preference. If the concept works, and something can be done to make it more suitable to someone's personal taste, by all means, do what works for you. A good example was brought up earlier (roundrock, I think) - cut everything in half, and only risk 1.25% per trade with a 5% monthly target. If you're more conservative, this may work better for your personal appetite for risk. Another option was suggested to possibly use the actual pip difference between the two candles as a "filter", and only trade if it is larger than some value - that's another great concept to test for yourself and see if it works for you. All of that said, for me there is a limit on how far I'll go in search of "perfection". Once I'm happy, I don't need to go any further. So far, I'm happy with the 10% and quit approach. Sure, it can probably be improved upon, maybe reached a few days sooner by filtering out some trades. Maybe the drawdown can be reduced along the way. Maybe we can eek out another few percent. The importance of any of these is probably different for all of us. How much it is worth to someone to pursue the improvements is really up to them. I've not found a reason to change much for my taste - except for one idea that I quickly realized wasn't as appealing as it first seemed. But I think everyone should find their own "comfort level", and then stop once you get there... How many "system" threads have we all seen that seem to be constantly trying to improve what is seemingly a pretty good strategy to begin with? All that ever seems to happen is people get bored with all the "improving" and eventually it just fades away before any meaningful analysis can be done on any one set of "rules". Don't let this discourage anyone from posting suggestions.... Keep them coming, what I may think I don't need to pursue may be exactly the idea someone else was looking for. I have the same belief about backtesting. I really have little tolerance (though I try to be cordial about it) for questions about "what are your backtest results?" If you want statistics, do your own backtest and get them. You've got everything you need to decide if you want to invest any time beyond what it took to read through a thread in testing it out for yourself. My "backtesting" is done purely as a vehicle to determine if a system is worth spending any time or energy FORWARD testing... To me, that is where the value is. So my "results" are going to be either "worth moving forward with", or "not worth moving forward with." - if I present any statistics at all, they will be very "general". I'll jump off my soapbox now. NONE of this was directed any individual, so if you have asked about backtesting, don't take offense... This is just me sharing my feelings about the topic. Seems like that has to be spelled out from time to time - people can really get defensive... Anyway.... I guess my point here is - sure, improve to a point you're personally comfortable with, and then give the thing a chance before changing it again. How can you ever know if something will work for you if you never stop changing it? (wow - you just never know when I'll burst out with a rant like this. Sorry... Carry on.... )

Cgery Love the way you do 4x and treat as a business. I've learned alot from reading all your post even on other threads you started I would Like to try this but it's 1-2 am est for the 8 9 candle I do an Asian box breakout that I set at 11.30pm est then I wake at 6.30am and close no matter what. Do you know of an EA that will do what you ask here. I know ea's don't run automatic and need loads of watching and setting up but fr after hour trades they work. I've looked for an ea that will look back so many barss and place trade bla bla bla found a few but non did what I'm looking for Following your posts

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hehehe... Thanks dry.... Yeah, I recently looked at one of my old threads (fortunately, I haven't started many), and realized just how much I thought I knew back then... I was one of the people I've tried to warn others about here . I was even defensive about a "system" I was using at the time that had an absolutely AWFUL risk:reward, but I was convinced winners outnumbered losers by enough to make it work, and wouldn't hear otherwise. But it is all part of the learning process, after all... The upside is, it can be quite rewarding to see how far you've come over several years. Check post #61 ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...2&amp;postcount=61 ). roundrock started a thread with an EA he posted for this system. I have not tried it, but there is one out there. My only request is that any discussion related to that EA stay in that thread and don't end up here as a "support" or "can you make it do..." discussion. The timing for this system is overnight for me too... But, this is one of those rare cases when I believe an EA can return the same results as manual. There is absolutely no discretion here, no misinterpreting a cross, no second-guessing a SL or TP. EAs have their place (I even use two live), but I hate to encourage anyone to rely on a robot for anything but the simplest, completely and totally non-discretionary system.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
what I like to do is go out as far as I can on a chart and draw some lines you know high lows H&amp;S support resistance then drill down do the same till I get to the TF i'm using. It has been very helpful. If I see PA near one of these lines I will not trade or maybe only go short I just saw the ea you refereed to and will check it out Thanks

+10 Pips on Oanda Thanks, cgrey!

--- 帖子 #263 ---

--- 帖子 #264 ---
We'll take 'em 10 pips at a time.... When it starts to get fun (at least it did while I was backtesting), is when we start asking what day will be the one we hit the 10%, as opposed to will we win or lose

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi cgrey, In regards to the 10% a month target... Say for example we have lost 5% in the whole month of February. What is our target for March? 1. 5% we lost + Feb 10% target + Mar 10% target? 2. 5% we lost + Mar 10% target? 3. Mar 10% target

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I believe cgrey has said it's always 10% of monthly starting balance regardless if prior month was negative.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
cgrey, The market with 1/2 hour before trading time remains flat as a pancake. With "Freaky Friday" occurring later today, it would seem traders are sitting on the sideline waiting for the USA unemployment report. Would this be a good day to avoid trading? Thanks, Bob

My trade reached stoploss today... -20 pips...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
my too,price hit pip in pip. When we set sl(sell) what we do with spred?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
i skipped the trade today due to NFP, but i recorded it as a loss in my books so that i can aim 12.5% this month

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi, I have some question abaut todays traid. Why your stop loss was 30 pips? candle open 1.6747 and sl was...1.6777.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Every month we reset - so target is always 10% of the starting balance of that month.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
This, and your other question about spread, have both been answered several times already. I'd suggest you read through this thread again, and you will find the answers to both.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Now that we know we had a SL today, yep - it would have been a good day not to trade Seriously, though, this is probably another one of those that I'd have to answer by saying there is nothing that says you shouldn't make that decision based on what you are comfortable with. I didn't skip any days what I tested. I generally don't avoid trading (outside of this system) on NFP days (in fact, I see them as opportunities), though I do tend to evaluate my open positions and tighten up stops. Generally speaking, you are absolutely correct that the market is usually flat leading up to NFP, so it seems like a realistic approach to choose not to trade this day each month.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
rr - just curious... If you didn't trade, but recorded as a loss, why not just trade? You were already "expecting" a loss, so the absolute worst that could have happened is what you expected. On the other hand, it is impossible to win if you don't trade. As it turned out, we did lose today... But had we won, you would have still recorded a "loss" without even having a chance for the win.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I am cutting out early today for a 3-day weekend out of town with the family. I will probably be around for a couple of hours this morning, but I definitely won't be checking in after noon today or over the weekend at all. Good weekend to everyone... Monday we'll start to dig out of the hole that we've started February in.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
if it had met the monthly PP, then i would have missed it and i would continue trading till i get it, yes its a risk not trading, but i will take that risk on NFP day

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I get that part - totally understand about choosing not to trade due to comfort with the risk. sorry... I should have been more clear.... Why not just record it as "0" (no trade) instead of recording a loss when you didn't trade? I guess it works out the same in the end - I was just surprised that you'd intentionally record a loss when you didn't lose. Don't mind me - just a "math thing"

--- 帖子 #279 ---
cgrey, How will the Superbowl results affect this strategy?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
When Green Bay wins (I'm not a Packers fan, I just can't support the Steelers after they knocked the Jets out), all times used for this system will change to Central Standard Time in their honor.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Take care cgrey. Hope you and your family have a wonderful weekend. Hopefully we have a good week next week, but either way I think it's good that we have a bad stretch during testing so we can know what is possible. Man I can't believe you're a Jets fan! I am a Dolphins fan so naturally we don't like the Jets. You're alright though cgrey. Actually, I didn't hate (for lack of better word) the Jets that much this year. I'm still a Jason Taylor fan and I also like LT and Sanchez. At first I didn't like Rex Ryan's brash personality, but I actually started to grow to like the guy this year. See you all next week.

another loss... Target gain for February is now 18%...

--- 帖子 #285 ---
OLARION How do you get another loss when the hourly candle has about 35mins before it closes? Are you sure you are using 8am gmt candle?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
SL was hit (20 pips). So the close of the hourly candle was obsolete. I used the right candle, 8 am GMT. Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Yes...my results as well.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Sorry about that, still half asleep

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Yeah, too bad we won't be able to get along (kidding)... January is usually a disappointing month for Jets fans... You can only say "there's always next year" so many times before you stop believing it...

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Congrats, Bob...

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Yeah - we'll chip away at it. Still a lot of time left in February... During testing, there were many months that had a string of losses. The thing that is nice about it is, it only takes a few of the bigger winners to wipe the losses out. Hang in there....

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I guess alot of people are not as excited as last week, lol. Anyway, you said it cgrey, just got to hang in there. I like to think that there will be streaks in our favor and when they do hit they will be nice since they won't be capped at 20+/- pips. I for one am glad we're getting to see this now. This might not even be that bad compared to some of the other bad streaks. Again though, it's all about hanging in there and following the rules like a machine.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
today is a good day )

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Good pippage today.... +35 pips.... This is a system that takes patience....not all traders have patience to wait day by day and survive to a losing stick...

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Indeed.. And really, to be successful trading ANY system - patience is one of the keys. Right up there with money management. It is one of those things that separates the pros from the amateurs. Amateurs will over-trade, always feeling the need to be in a trade. Pros will pick their shots, going after only the best opportunities. In my "real" trading, there are some months I take as few as 3 trades all month. Personally, I'd rather pull in 8% per month on only three really high percentage trades than on 20 "average" trades - few chances to lose.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yep - having some losses is definitely not unexpected. There were some rough months in testing, and even a few that ended up as losers. There is no system that never loses, and this certainly isn't one either. But sticking to it is key. If you decide to quit for the month, then make sure you can accept the loss and quit for the month. Don't go back 2-days later. Skipping days will practically guarantee you won't hit the monthly target. The day you skip will be the 60+ pip winner that would have wiped out all of the previous losses in the month...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Cgrey and everyone, 1st of all would like to congratulate and thank cgray for a great system. I've just finished reading the thread and going to start trading live next week. I have one question to everyone and I know crgray has specifically asked for no one to discuss this on his thread but is there someone or someplace where I can get a EA for this system. If anyone can help me out can you please PM me as I dont want to cause any disruption to this thread and the only reason I ask is because I work nightshift here in UK and dont get home until 9am so an EA would be great. Best of luck to everyone Cheers Momo

--- 帖子 #298 ---
You must have missed post #61 while reading through the thread... Go in slowly if you're going to trade this live... There WILL be drawdown (we've been as low as 7% down already this month). Just want you to be prepeared, and adjust accordingly for your preference.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Cgrey, Thanks for the advice, I will be going in slow and I dont know how the hell i missed that post infact i read the thread twice I must be really tired after my nightshift, better get to my bed lol. Anyways thanks again. Cheers

Good luck!

anybody has writter any excel tracker for this system ? inputs are starting balance, monthly target percentage, stoploss percentage, stoploss pips, spread. it should log everyday data. we will enter GMT0 Open price, GMT8 Open , Close price. It should calculate the lotsize, stoploss, take profit , PL for today and update the current account balance, monthly PL. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi All, Thanks for the thread and strategy! I've been dabbling myself with this currency and I definitely like that the Asian session doesn't mess with it too much heading into the London open. How does the Trade Balance news coming out at 4:30am EST affect the strategy? If at all. My take: If it's much more negative than forecast, I could see it bouncing down to 1.6040 range (which indicates the short by this strategy), but I'd be worry about all those Long stops in that area. Might shoot back up to 1.6140 range where a whole bunch of sellers are AND then start heading back down, perhaps stalling at the 1.6040 range again. Until King speaks again, I think we are going to be pretty much rangebound between 1.6200 and 1.6000. I'm primarily looking at the 30min chart and seeing back to 1/31. What do you all think? Thanks! -Charlie

--- 帖子 #304 ---
With The Tokyo and London open prices almost the same, who is entering the trade? It looks more like a crap shoot this morning...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
another loss...let's hope for tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi mate This is a variation of the London Surge strategy I was taught at one of the trading seminars last year however you look back at the open price. Simple yet effective . I will say that myself and my trading buddies have backtested all sorts if London surge scenario strats and the success rate was superb in the past, 2009 and before. It seems as of late that there are pre-surges on cable before 8am, maybe 6am, maybe 7am. A lot of these are false breakouts and spike us in. I too am looking for that one good, high probability trade a day, and then be able to walk away happy with a view to repeat. I haven't read this whole thread yet, just the first post and the last page. If there is still a need for an excel app to help us all with this strat then I'd be more than happy to help Cheers Mark

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Have a good read through the thread. I've said many times, this system takes absolutely nothing in to account other than the two candle open prices. The way I trade it, I go in based on the "rules" I've set for myself - period. Hence, my several references to gambling. That being said - I am all for fundamental trading... It is the core of what I call my "real" trading. It just has nothing at all to do with this particular system.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
It's a crap shoot every day, Bob

--- 帖子 #309 ---
In a nutshell, that's our goal here. Minimize the losses with a relatively conservative stop, and bank the bigger trades.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello everybody I've read the thread and today I took a chance. Sold at 8hs bar open (6068) and stopped out (-20 pips), then I sold again at 6095 with good reward, closed at 6052 (+43 pips) for a total of +23 . I know I broke some rules but I like the system. I won't post any related to my trading way, I think this can be more profitable, this just to thank you for the idea. Let's see tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
do you have some stats on the pip-distance ? today it hit SL. May be the pip-distance has to be above some number. but we dont have the data to confirm this. anyway cgrey mentioned several times without all these rules it worked. so lets keep it like this

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Great - I hope the concept has given you some ideas to make your own to be successful with!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This concept of how close the two prices are cointinues to intrigue me. True, I have no data, and I still haven't had the time to really dig in to it. But I do continue to believe this could be one realtively simple filter that might work and not drastically change the underlying concept of the system.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
That's the key. Hang in there until the runs go in our favor. Trade like a machine. LIKE A MACHINE!!! That will be one of the things we may get out of "practice" trading this method. Maybe we pick up on a pattern and then use it to fine tune the method. I personally like entering each day even if the price is difference is small. As someone stated before, it's pretty much a crap shoot. With the loss limited, I have no problem going in hoping for the breakout to go in my favor.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
here's a excel generated from my backtesting. It has date, gap, PL gap is the pip distance between GMT0, GMT8 Open prices draw your own comparisons. i sorted by gap my conclusion is avoid trades if gap &lt; 9

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Good stuff rr.... More than half of the trades (17 out of 30) stopped out when the difference between the candles was less than 9 pips.. This may be a starting point...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I'm not going to modify my actual trading just yet. But I am going to track in my journal the "gap" between the two open prices for the remainder of February. That will let me do a "what if" for the rest of the month, and see if there is a difference in the outcome. I have to say - I am really leaning toward adding this filter - exactly as roundrock proposes it (don't trade if the "gap" is less than 9 pips). We'll see what happens if I put this in place for March. I'll also be going live with about $1k for this system in March, IF OANDA has rolled out MT4 to live accounts by then...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Here's the other thing we need to look at: 1) is the small difference a result of a big move and then retracement back to the same area it was 8 hours earlier? or 2) was it pretty much flat the whole 8 hours? Is there a difference between the two? I would think if pa (price action) has been flat then a breakout is imminent. Vice versa for when pa has already made a big move. This is something to watch and note while we are testing this method.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Nice strategy. Clearly presented. Very similar to other slingshot strategies, but it has it's own twist. I would be intrested in comparing it to the Frankfurt Head Fake/London reversal strategy. The Frankfurt strategy does not always give you a signal, but when it does there is high probability that London will reverse. Perhaps you could use Frankfurt price action as a filter to tweak your entries. Just an idea. Good trades to all..... Regards, ps-- if you were going to use frankfurt open as a filter, you may need to look at more than one pair to trade. If you get a head fake at this time, it is often in only one currency pair (ie price lies close enough to some easy stop pickings). Still, the price action is often in G/U as it is a popular pair there.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Now you're making it complicated Good points - and yes, I think there is a difference. Question is, for those that truly want a "set and forget" system, is there a way to account for this without discretion?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yea, it's truly up to one's preference. I have no issues with trading according to the original rules. In fact, my preference is to not even bother looking at how much of a difference the 0 GMT &amp; 8 GMT candles have. However, if 17 out of 30 losers are when the difference is &lt;9 pips, that shouldn't be ignored either. So if going to go that much further into it (which is not alot, in my opinion), why not look at the difference between the two points in my previous post. Just a thought worth following in my opinion. Maybe when we're done testing the difference isn't enough to change the original method. Thanks again cgrey and all for keeping the thread smooth and making good points. Let's just keep chugging along and trading likes machines!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks Petra.... That's what we need now - a catchy name... "Head fake..." I'll search - haven't seen that specifically, but have heard of some others like Big Ben and countless breakout and straddle type systems. All along, I've been preaching the fine line between improving and over-complicating. I'm all for improvements, and also encourage people to take an idea and run with it.. This, for me, will never be more than sort of a "side" strategy (I've called it a hobby earlier in the thread) to keep me busy in between my "real" trades. For others, it may have more (or less) importance, and the amount of time they want to put in to it may differ accordingly. All the same, I remain open to things we can try that keep the basic idea of this system intact and maintaining simplicity. Most of all, we have what, at least for now, appears to be something we can work with and hopefully all gain from.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
cgrey, there is one thing I wanted to mention. It has come up before on this thread, but wasn't discussed much. I know you have stated on multiple occasions that this is just a "side project" or "hobby" in between your real trading, but is there another reason why you wouldn't continue trading right through the 10% gain for the month? For instance in January another 3% was made after reaching the 10% early in the month. Wouldn't it be foolish (for lack of better word) to leave money on the table? Of course it's possible that it could go negative, but if you believe in the methodology then why stop at a certain point. Again I know for you it's more of a matter for distraction, but to someone who would take it more serious would you recommend continue to trade? Or would not recommend it due to some kind of law of averages reason (or other reason)?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Nothing more than a pervasive belief in not over-trading. My entire "business plan" so-to-speak is built around capital preservation. Simply put, the simplest thing you can do to not lose money is to not trade. And to anyone who got in to the Forex game for the thrill of trading, this is probably one of the hardest hurdles to overcome. Obviously, you can't gain by not trading either... So, I set goals, and when I reach them, I stop. Sure, I may be leaving money on the table. But I'd take that any day over having reached a goal only to give part of it back when I could have locked it in. And this system especially is not one with a high win %. The money management is what makes it work. You WILL give at least part of it back. Whether specific to this system or not, I would recommend to anyone exactly this: Set a goal, whether it is 2%, 5%, 10%, or more. It can be daily, weekly, monthly.... But make it realistic, and when you get to it, stop. It is important enough to repeat over and over - capital preservation is the most important aspect of trading if you want to do this for a living. Never, EVER enter a trade thinking "how much can/will I win?" Always enter a trade thinking "what is the most I will allow myself to lose?"

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Great answer. Straightforward and well said. I love the business approach. The way you just said it makes sense and it 'clicked' for me when you said set a realistic goal and preserve capital. Thank you cgrey. I really liked this opening line. It's definitely a hurdle for someone who is not "there" yet.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Sorry, I really don't want to beat a dead horse here, but it is soooo important. Not aiming this at you 2+2, but at anyone who may someday want to do this for a living.... The business approach is the ONLY approach if you ever want to make your living trading (whether forex or any other trading). You need to take it seriously. Dumb luck aside, you will not succeed in this or any other business without a plan. If you want this to be your only (or even primary) source of income, it IS a business, and you need to treat it like one. Otherwise, it's a hobby. No matter how good you may be at it - if you're not treating it like a business, developing a plan, and executing that plan - defining what is an acceptable loss, having some sort of "targets", analyzing your revenue stream, understanding where your money goes (losses), knowing what you will do to still be in this next week, next month, next year - trading forex will never be anything more than a hobby... (hopefully) "making a little extra money on the side" is the best you can hope for.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Getting back to this for just a minute... Since we're so early in to February, I went back and took a look at the impact so far. Today is the only day in February that we would have filtered out the trade. As it happens, today we hit SL. For me, I'm currently down 6.57% for February. If we throw out today's trade based on the 9-pip filter, it would be 4.24% down instead.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
A loss again... Still some days left this month. Target gain now: 19%

--- 帖子 #329 ---
anybody agrees ?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Please remove your post which is totally irrelevant to this system.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I'm not sure that is the "offical name", that is just what I have heard it called by numerous traders over the years. As a filter for your system, I would consider correlating the 7gmt (Frankfurt open) candle with the the 8gmt(London open)--- specifically looking at the reversal pattern between them. One problem is that the movements don't always happen within the 1 hr candles. Some times frankie move will come in a little early (6:45gmt). London will sometimes start early as well (7:45gmt). If I were looking for a filter and/or trigger, I would be looking @ 5 min candles between 6:30gmt (for entry) and 9:15ish (for exit). In most cases this is a great time for price action. Good luck with your little diversion! Yes, after a time trading gets boring as hell. Most of your time is spent sitting around waiting. Regards,

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Bilalshah, this system doesn't take into account s/r's or trendlines. This system is hoping to catch lightning in a bottle, figuratively speaking. You can incorporate whatever you like into this method, but I think it's best that we stay away from trying to add too much to it. This system basically hopes to get get a large 1 hour candle in the traders direction by way of a reversal from the previous 8 hour overall direction. That along with money management rules is what we're testing here. So again, please try not to overcomplicate it from that.

And another loss... -4 pips

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Dear Cgrey Please find attached the Excel file based on your Money Management Idea for the One Trade a Day thread. It is user friendly, just must fill the purple cells. The starting Balance in cell B3, pip value in cell C3 and the daily finish of pips (gain or loss) in cell I6 to I30. It will automatically set tomorrow’s trade in detail. I locked the calculations for not to be accidently deleted. If you want the password, I will send it also. Thanks for your great idea. If there are any comments to improve it, please let me know. All the best.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thank you Merlin.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Thanks Merlin - I know a few people have asked for something like this. Your contribution is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thank you friends There was a mistake in computing the new Balance, the pip value was not considered. It is considered at Ver2. The password for sheet protection is “cgrey”. If any one wants to improve it, please do. Happy weekend.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks Merlin...nice addition! Best regards, Bob in Wisconsin

--- 帖子 #340 ---
thanks merlin for the ' excel 'lent work. this will help me track the daily trades. however there is one logical error because of this the daily balance is showing wrong. the lotsize doesnt change daily. its fixed at start of the month, only TP changes daily.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
... depends on whether or not you go with the "simpler" math that I posted. When *I* am trading (and of course, that doesn't have to be the same way you trade it), I actually do calculate the lot size every day based on what 2.5% of the balance is that day. In the end, it makes very little difference - what it amounts to is a few pips difference when we get close to the target... If we're already up several %, our lot size would be slightly higher, and therefore the pips needed to reach the final few % would be slightly fewer. But again, the difference is minimal, and it does make the math a whole lot easier to stick with the same lot size for the entire month. Only reason I do it this way is because my EA calculates this stuff "on the fly" at the time it places the trade. So I just very quickly calculate what 2.5% of the current account balance is at the time of the trade, instead of needing a variable for it.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Dear Roundrock Thanks for your attention. I think the balance is correct. It is the sum of current daily starting balance, + or - the pips gain or loss, times the pip $ value. But about the lot, it is the Cgrey’s assumption. We always risk 2.5% (.025) of our starting capital, but I made it so that if the balance goes blow the starting amount, it will resize the lot with the reduced balance. I can make it for higher balance also. Please find it attached, Ver03. Regards.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Good work Merlin. This is going to help me tremendously. I was using pen and paper before. You should of seen the mess of papers on my desk between backtesting and stuff. Only request I have is: can you make the "TP pip" recalculate to make exactly .1 reward (10%) based on the "lot" size after loss(es). It seems to keep calculating "TP pip" (target) based on the starting lot size. If this is too complicating or cannot be done then no big deal cause I can figure it out on paper. Once again thanks, hope you and all have a great weekend. Looking forward to Monday. EDIT: NEVERMIND ON REQUEST TO CHANGE "TP PIP" RECALCULATION. I READ CGREY'S POST ON HOW IN THE END IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE AND ALSO HAD A MOMENT OF CLARITY WHERE I REALIZED IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE MATH.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
We're just about halfway through February. We've had 9 trading days, with 11 to go. Tough month so far - only two winners of the 9 days. Of the 7 losers, 5 of them stopped us out. Below is taken from my trading journal, showing where we are so far. With 11 trading days left, let's see if we can pull out a winning month, even if we end up short of the 10% target. We know from past experience in our backtests that is is possible to wipe out the roughly 9% loss so far with just one or two nice wins. We'll see if we can start this week with one of them and get back on our feet.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Was that a pep talk? Haha. Okay seriously now, let's see how we do coming down the backstretch of this month. From a purely mathematical standpoint it seems reasonable to think this system is profitable over the long haul. The odds are you will choose the right direction 50% of the time (up or down, based on pure randomness). Since the wrong side is capped (20+/- pip SL) and the right side isn't, that would lead one to believe this could work. I'm obviously not shedding light on anything new, but I just want to reiterate that so that we stay focused to the plan. I like what we're doing in recording the gap. We may pick up on a pattern therefore increasing our odds of picking winners. Lastly, we should also pay attention and note how often price reverses from the 0-8 GMT candle and how often it doesn't. This could be the essential element to this system. Going with the flow until it changes and then going that other way if it does. Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Days like this I'm glad I'm still in demo... Our biggest win of the month so far (around 35-pips today), and for some reason, my EA didn't trade it today. It's gonna be a fun week...

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hmmm.... Looks like the problem is IBFX. Prior to this demo for this system, I haven't used them for anything in a while. I thought their demos didn't expire, but maybe they've changed that since last time I opened a demo with them, because it looks like that is what happened. I get "invalid account" when I try to log in to it (and it was almost exactly 30-days ago to the day that it was opened). So, looks like the rest of this month is going to have to be done "on paper" (or in a spreadsheet, at least). Unfortunately, that breaks the myfxbook journal. I'll post regular updates here for the rest of the month. In March we'll transition to OANDA , either demo or live depending on whether or not their live MT4 is ready.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
yes, 35 pips profit and the gap is 60 pips !!! we will record the corelation of gap to performance

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I make that trade as $126.90 profit, +4.4%, and overall balance now $3027.56 (overall gain for Feb = -4.91%) Can anyone confirm?

Updated with today's trade:

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Sounds about right. See my post above - this is my journal for the month so far.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hello everyone. A positive day I see. Nice.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Thanks for taking the time on this cgrey. I have learned a lot from this thread. I like your mm strategy that you use on this trade, and also your idea that you need to treat forex like a business. I read your old journals from the past and I noticed how you like to test a trade for 3 months before changing any parameters. I do think you should incorporate the rule of not taking the trade if the gap is 9 pips or less. Thats just my opinion of course. Another question for the guys who trade this manually. What if you didn't enter your trade right away and waited to put the trade in a little closer to your sl? You would have a better r/r that way. One more idea for all the traders that are thinking of trading this for more then 10% a month. Set your tp at 10% like cgrey does. Once you make 10% on however many trades it takes to get there, reset and use 10% as your tp again. Same if you have a dd of 10% reset and start over on your 10% goal. I think it would keep your tp realistic that way. Example, start with $1000. After ten trades you have $1100. Reset and go for 10% again. Maybe you have a a few bad trades in a row and are down 10%. So now you have $990. Reset your goal and go for 10% again. disclaimer, I have not went back and looked to see if either idea would help or hinder, just a couple ideas I had while reading this thread. Also cgrey, as you can see this is my first post and I would like to ask you about a mm strategy for a trade that I use. I can not pm or email other members yet. So if you would be kind enough to email me or pm me I would really appreciate it. If you don't have the time I totally understand. Since I am a noob I think its better for me to read the forums then post useless garbage to get my post count up so I am allowed to pm other members. Sorry guys for the long winded post also.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Great day today.....attached you can see the updated equity of my slightly modified version of the strategy. With today trade (+58 pips)...my strategy is +77 pips in gain this month, considering that the target is 80 pips...one could also stop trading for the month...without risking anymore for only 3 pips difference... One thing to notice....my demo calculations are without spread... I did a backtest with spread included and some months the target is not achieved due to spread, but the strategy remains positive...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Chris, great result. Can you shortly summarize your modifications? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Nice day and I nearly did not take it as price was very close to the opening price on the 00.00 candle About 15 pips I think

--- 帖子 #357 ---
What if price goes in trade direction without any drawdown as soon as the position is opened (as was the case today)? Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Please see post# 263. And I believe he is not stopping trading when 10% monthly goal is achieved. He takes every trade during the month so some months will yield greater than 10% and some not. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Here's one of the reasons I continue to like this system - two good days (yesterday and today) have wiped out the 9% we were down going in to the week, and we're now slightly up. Journal below is updated with today's trade. (I'll get to some responses a little later)...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Said in a few words: 1. I watch 01:00 candle to pick direction instead of 00:00 candle 2. I don't recalculate my target every day...so I don't close the current trade if the target is reached but I leave it open until the end of the candle, this may seem a slight difference but it's not...because for example...this month i'm 77 pips in gain...the original strategy would put my target at only 3 pips tomorrow...my strategy doesn't put that limit, I let the trade close by itself...if it makes 50 pips for example..I've made a good amount of pips more than my monthly target....I hope it's clear. 3. Once my 80 pips monthly target has been exceeded I stop trading from next day. In other words, the target is 80 pips monthly (or 10%) but if the last trade goes over it..I let it go, doing this way...some months the gain is way over 80 pips. But again..my numbers are without spread...this make a difference in real results... In the image you can see trades for February, 1pip = 1$

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Can you please check your Feb 4th trade, because it was stopped out as entry was at 6147.3 and price went up to 6170.4 just after the entry. Thanks

Hi cg + all, I have spent a reasonable amount of time backtesting and tweaking this system over the last few weeks I think ~60 hours. (I am an IT worker currently between contracts) I have written an EA to help me with this, and have been testing on data back to Jan 2007. I have changed the system as proposed by cgrey. I wont post what I have done here out of respect, however I will post the few things I have learned and you can draw from this your own conclusions. Please understand that I have modified the system to fit with my view of risk / reward and the below may or may not apply to the system as proposed by cgrey. I hesitated to post this but think it may move the system forward for all. These findings are based on average returns from jan 2007. 1) I have seen the need to aim for more than 10% per month as big gains are needed to knock out the losing months. 2) Some months will run and run into the red - I have decided to limit my drawdown, and not take any more trades after a given % loss. 3) There are huge possible gains in given months eg I have found +60% is possible at least once per year. The question is, how do we identify and keep pursuing such months but still bank our gains in average months? 4) The day of the week has an effect on long term gains. For some reason, and I can't explain this, the system doesn't seem to work long term on wednesdays! It doesn't make any sense to me but here are my findings with modified MM to allow the tests to run long term: friday 1.3 thurs 28.1 Wed -50 tues 41.3 mon 60.2 I think it would be worth someone with a different perspective to me (I am running these tests completely automated) investigating if I am right or wrong with this one. 5) I don't have much faith currently in the use of the gap filter I haven't found it to be useful long term, my experience is that when we don't trade everyday we reduce our chance to meet the target consistently. One good day can turn around a whole losing month and by filtering trades we can miss these 'big days'. 6) Most losing days the SL is hit within the first few minutes, I don't know how to overcome this. Looking at the charts we would have a good chance to pick these out but due to the nature of this system and the fact that I am planning to trade by EA this isn't a good solution. I have an idea to split the lots across the open eg at 7:55, 8:05, 8:15 etc. I haven't done any testing but will post again if I find anything interesting. 7) Winning trades can often be left to run longer than 1 hour. Again draw your own conclusion from this. ------------------------------ I am not trying to derail this thread or change the underlying system as proposed, I am just posting to flag up a few details that have found had an effect on MY backtesting. The results and suggestions I have may well not hold true for the future but I post them honestly to show my current expectation for the system. I am very wary about projecting results based on backtests (Especially as I have seen small changes to the system can give similar results only for one year to fall of the edge of a cliff.) But on the results from jan 2007 I have 2 profiles emerging. One is a lower risk allowing a 5% DD per month and showing 2.1% account growth per month averaged over the last four years. The other which departs more radically from the system shows an averaged 9.1% gain per month but often suffers huge drawdowns of ~60%. I am very aware that results from backtesting show us only a small amount of the picture but it is my opinion this system give us an edge, an increase in probability or whatever else you want to call it. How big this advantage is would have to be proved I believe by forward testing. I know there is an EA already produced for this system that many may be using, but the EA I have written is fairly flexible and as such I would be happy to change parts and run tests to improve this system based on suggestions from the community. That is of course providing this is acceptable to cgrey and the changes are within my knowledge of Mql4. dave.

Hi dirtytough, This is looking more and more likely to be incorporated in to my set of rules, at least. Others can choose whether or not they want to set this filter. So far in Feburary, it would have filtered only one trade, but as it happens, that was a trade that stopped out. Other months that I've looked at this manually have all seemed to benefit from it, either in getting to target sooner and/or having less drawdown. I noticed someone else had answered this, and exactly the same way I would have... If the trade takes off in our direction as soon as we enter and never looks back, we would never be in it if we're waiting for it to come back down. I don't see anything wrong with this approach. Haven't personally tested it either. I use the monthly "boundary", again, going back to the perspective of a business. My business accounting is done monthly, so this just kind of evolved from that. Welcome. Even if you had enough posts for PMs, mine are turned off, so you wouldn't have reached me that way.. One recommendation as far as MM goes, and of course, this is my personal belief and others may tell you differently - never take a trade with a higher risk than reward. It will bite you in the end. {here comes a soapbox moment....} So many "systems" here have such broken money management, it's no wonder 95% of all retail traders fail. And some of them are fundamentally and/or technically sound as far as entries and exits go. No matter how many winners they get as opposed to losers, the first string of a few losers in a row puts you in a hole that you will never get out of. It's usually after a few weeks - maybe even a couple of months... Things are moving along nicely in a trending market. "We have 80% winning trades, so risking 2-3 times what we get is not a problem". Then the string of losses start, and three losses just wiped out the last 10 wins. A few more losses come, and now it takes 10 wins just to get back to break even. Magically, the thread then dies out... There are probably at least 100 stories like this here, all of which were systems that probably could have been at least somewhat profitable with proper money management. And this comes from experience... I had a system a few years ago that I felt exactly the same way about - HORRIBLE risk:reward, but I had lots of winners, so I was sure it didn't matter. And when some more experienced peeople pointed this out, I was sure I knew more than they possibly could about my own system, and ignored them. After a couple of months, the string of losers that came made me realize just how right they were...

Personally, I think the 9-pip threshold that roundrock suggested is the right number if you plan to filter based on the distance between the two opening prices. Glad you didn't miss ths one

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Chris, I'm going to need to spend some time taking a closer look... Some of your numbers are WAY different than mine in Februray. Even on trades that we would have both entered the same way based on comparing 00:00 or 01:00 to 08:00, you have a couple of winners when I had losers, or the pips won were much different when we both had winners. I only took a very quick look, but it seemed at first glance that there was only one trade so far this month that we would have entered in opposite directions (because of the difference in the 00:00 and 01:00), you would have taken a winner there, where I lost. But it doesn't make up the net difference in pips - you're currently +77, I'm currently +3 Since we haven't been above the 10% threshold yet, your leaving that "last" trade open beyond the target shouldn't have come in to play yet, either.. I need to dig in to your results further, but I'm wondering if you're doing anything at all differently with closing trades (either sooner or later than 1-hour if TP or SL wasn't hit)??

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Excellent stuff Dave... This is exactly what I wanted to get out of this - to present an idea that people can make work for them. I like that you put some serious time in to this to get it to a place you're comfortable with. I encourage discussion of your thoughts on how to improve the general concept. Of your list, I've thought a lot about #7 myself, but haven't found a good way to deal with it (yet). Of course, I'm against giving anything back once I have banked it, so that limits my options Similar thought about why I haven't pursued #3 further either. My only request, should you choose to make your EA public, is that you open a new thread to direct people to it. I would prefer this thread stay clear of all of the issues that usually pop up as soon as an EA is made available - "it doesn't work for me", "can you add this...", "how do I set the time zone", "why are my results different than yours" etc, etc... Congrats on the improvements you've made. I'm sure there are people looking to do more with this than how I've presented it, and will be happy to hear how you've done that.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
No...I don't do anything different...the trade opens at the beginning of the candle and closes at the end of the candle... Anyway...I don't consider spread and this...believe me...can make a big difference....and then it seems that my data feed is little different...this may be another reason for the different result. Today I don't have the time..but tomorrow I will make a comparison between my Strategy Trader feed and my Metatrader feed, in order to understand where are these differences... I don't really want to present here results that are completely out of reality...

--- 帖子 #369 ---
It may be mine that are out of reality When I have some time over the next couple of days, I'll try to pinpoint some of the specific differences I've seen - that may help.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hello everyone, hope all is well. In a matter of 2 weeks we have seen the ugly side and the beautiful side to this strategy. It's important to note however that both sides could play out longer. We got down 9% early, but as has been said before, the hole could of gotten deeper. Conversely, the gains which have made up the 9% loss could have been greater or can continue. The point I'm trying to make is even though we are booking results monthly, this is a long term strategy. I think it's prudent to not get too wrapped up in one month's results. However, this one looks like a winner. Chris's method is in interesting with regards to letting the last candle close and not at take profit. I think this is where it depends on what kind of trader you are. If you are like cgrey and looking to hit 10% and close for the month, then why risk it getting to your target and then reversing. There I think you should close out and book the month. If you are going to reset your 10% and continue the next day, then I think letting it run makes sense and may be worth the shot. I think I'm more like Chris in terms of continuing the trading every day even if target reached before month end, however, I have a hybrid method for that last candle. It kind of takes both cgrey's and Chris's style and combines them (sort of). Lets say the target is 3 pips to make 10%, instead of closing out when candle is done (9 GMT), I would double the target. In this case TP = 6. I would do this only when the target is less than 10 pips (1-9 pips). Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
some excellent posts today and very intersting observations. abour entering on a retracement closer to SL, i did backtesting using EA, it gave worse results than regular entry. best example is today. price didnt even retrace a pip and got us 60 pips in the end i am now 'scared' of the wednesday trade (tomorrow). has anyone spend time on another pair and other entry candle hours ? very rarely u see something works on GU bit not EU

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Yep I thought of that also. And thought if a backtest shows it dd 5 pips 95% of the time before it go's positive it might be worth implementing. Probably wouldn't help though like you said. Not trying to change anybodies system, just throwing out an idea that might offer less risk.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Thanks for taking the time to respond. Like I said I read through some of your old journals. I noticed you used to have a really bad r/r on your system 1 trades. I used to think it didn't matter also but am learning that it does. Looks like you figured out how to trade successfully so congrats. Thanks for the advice cgrey and everybody else in this thread. I am learning from all of it.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Those were the days... It's nice when you can look back several years later and see just how far you've come. Hang in there. Learning is key. Put your mind to it - develop a plan and stick to it, and you will be successful. Trading isn't rocket science (though, don't be fooled in to thinking it is simple, either). But I do believe that anyone that dedicates themselves to learning their business can succeed.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Good stuff here Dave. Since the market is always changing, it can't be solved like a puzzle, but the more familiar we are with it the more likely we are to succeed. This is currently the biggest question I have with this system. Is it profitable (or most profitable) in the long run only shooting for 10% then stopping. What is the best way to get the most out of this system in a month. In my opinion, if the mm is good enough to shoot for 10% then why stop there? The big question for me is at what target do I want to recalculate the next target AND do we stop and recalculate when in drawdown at some point (which is something you point out)? I would trade each day and recalculate target after every 10% target reached. That is my personal preference. What do you think? Surprised to see this. Don't know what to think. I guess I would start by trading on Wednesday and if I notice what has been the case in the past then just stop trading on wednesday. I'm inclined to always enter a trade, even when the gap is small. The most I have to lose is 20 pips, but I have the possibility of getting more than 20+ pips. Unless the evidence becomes overwhelming, I will continue to trade on small gaps. There is no way to overcome this. You could try staggering entries, but if price shoots in your favor right from the entry then you miss out on entering the rest of your order. Sometimes you just got to s**t in your shorts and jump in the pool. In my opinion, the trade could go for you or against you after one hour so to me this is negligible. For simplicity's sake and ease of trading I would just close the trade after one hour. You should have already gotten the big wave anyway (at least on most days).

Hi guys! I've seen some interesting post in the thread in the last hours... For what I can say...I've made a serie of backtests and as I said I found the best results in what I'm doing now....this system ain't broken...so don't fix it too much. The concept is a good idea and can bring to you an average of 10% every month... Surely...some month you can go over 10% if you don't stop...but I've seen more than a few months in my backtest where you got your 10% and then finish the month losing.... Are you really not happy with a 10% monthly?? Even some professional traders can't do this percentage consistently.... GBPUSD is the cross that works...and obviously there is a reason...and it's because of London open...in London they trade GBP...this is the reason..maybe you can try GBPJPY but I don't think other currencies will work (EURUSD is less volaitle). I've also optimized with others hours to take the trade and....these are the best results (for me): take the trade at the beginning of 08:00 GMT candle and make comparison with 01:00 GMT candle. Even original 00:00 GMT candle gives good results but the drawdown is much higher (by my backtest)

A (little) win...+6 pips

This is today trade...+8,4 pips (without spread) Does it match with yours?? Open at 1.61762 Close at 1.61678 My platform says that in February i'm at +84 pips...so target is reached and slightly exceeded. Today I will make comparison with MT4 feed and will add spread to my backtests...

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Chris, Thanks for your evaluation...but I am puzzled. In looking back several trades, there doesn't seem to be much if any difference in comparing the 08:00 GMT candle to either the 00:00 candle or 01:00 candle...there's only 1 hour difference. Maybe it serves to change trade direction entries for the better on some of the really close price comparisons? Am I missing something here? Thanks, BC2

--- 帖子 #380 ---
It's just an optimization over the last 18 months...01:00 candle gives better results in the long run...maybe not much difference in just 1 month and yes..the only difference can be the direction of the trade...

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Chris, I trade on Oanda : Open: 1.6170 Close: 1.6177 Profit: +7 pips

--- 帖子 #382 ---
And here is my comparison.....between my feed on Strategy Trader ( FXCM ) and Metatrader (Alpari) There are obviously slightly differencies, this happens on every broker feed, but there is a day (4th of February) where the difference is very huge. On Strategy Trader I have a win, and in MT4 I have a loss, this makes big difference in total pips. Both calculations are before spread...so the pips count is even worse in both cases with spread added. Can someone copmare my data with his own? I want to understand why on 4th of February there is so much difference, maybe is a FXCM data feed error...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi guys, I've been reading through the posts, and I had an idea. That's all it is, an idea to put in the mix, so feel free to flame, ridicule or whatever if it's a bad one. This system could be looked at from another point of view. Instead of making 10% a month, or letting it run on after the 10% target has been made, what do you think of just starting again after the 10% target has been reached, rather than wait for the end of the month? For example, in January just prior to the beginning of the thread, the 10% target was reached in 3 days. So you reach 10% on January 3rd (4th?) and then start again for the next 10% regardless of where we are in the month or even which month we're in. If it floats your boat, you can take some profits each time the target is reached. Apart from that all you need to do is remember to set the ea everyday. I'm agraid I'm way too busy to backtest this, but it just sprang to mind. If I've missed someone else with the same idea, please accept my apologies. Later Alan

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Only major difference is Feb 1st as you took long whereas system was short due to GMT difference and of course Feb 4th trade as system was stopped out. Including these differences, total pip gain in February by using IBFX, rounding the 5th digit and including spread is 19 pips (including today's 7 pips gain).

--- 帖子 #385 ---
What was the main reason why the GBP/USD fell despite of positive forecast and result? Im wondering. i really want to catch the trend to profit. but it hit my stop loss on a sudden at 2/16/2011 10AM UK. ?? it shoot down so fast. Anyone could help me? thanx..

--- 帖子 #386 ---
You may want to take this question to another topic in the "trading discussion" or "rookie discussion" area. It has nothing to do with the disussion of this particular system.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
This part should be bold, underlined, and made twice a large. Along the way in this thread, I've shared some personal opinions about some things make someone a "professional" trader. Now, I will share one of the top things that PREVENT someone from becoming a pro... Greed. Greed leads to emotion. Emotion leads to lack of discipline. Lack of discipline leads to mistakes and over trading. Mistakes and over trading lead to losses. This is the basis for my 10% and stop rule. I can cover my expenses, pay my salary and my wife's, and put money away for my son's college fund on 10% per month, and still have some left over to leave in and let the business grow. This is how you run a business. Not having the discipline to stop when you reach your goals turns "trading" in to "gambling", and separates the pros from the amateurs. If you have done your homework and laid out a business plan, you know exactly what your monthly return needs to be to cover your expenses, grow your business, and pocket what you want to keep. There is no reason in the world to keep going past that and risk loss. If 10% per month on whatever your balance is can not cover this, you are under-capitlized. Add "under capitalization" right under greed to the list of things that will prevent you from becoming a "pro" - they go hand in hand. If you don't have a large enough account to be able to set a reasonable target, and your strategy becomes "just keep trading for as much gain as possible", you need to increase your funding, NOT increase your risk. Now, maybe you don't care about trading like a business. Maybe this is just a hobby for you, and you never want it to be anything more. Then by all means - keep going.. Get as much as you can out of it. Your risk tolerance is likely to be higher if your approach to trading is more from the perspective of being a hobby... At times, I forget that there are folks out there that really are doing this for fun, and have no interest in making a career/business out of trading. I need to remind myself of this from time to time - and of course, the perspective on how to approach managing your account would be entirely different....

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Here's ours side by side (sorry I didn't make it pretty). I don't record the actual open/close prices - just the final pips. The big difference for me was 1-February, which is the only day so far in Feb that we would have entered in different diretions based on the 01:00 vs 00:00 candles. Net difference of about 13 pips there, but otherwise, the differences all seem to be just data feed and spread. So, this does show how significant a difference those two factors can make.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Thanks for your comparison...as I said...spread makes a very big difference.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Yep, and it is a good idea. It was suggested a couple of times earlier on, and I agree - if your tolerance for risk lets you run this way, by all means, go for it. Like anything else - to gain more, you need to risk more. So it becomes a personal preference. Nothing at all wrong with the logic behind it, though.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
The main reason I would think about using the 10% +/- and restart rule is because I would feel like I am not staying consistent if I didn't make the trade everyday. Kinda like I was picking and choosing trades just because the calendar says its a new month. I really like the business approach though cgrey. Makes me want to go out and get a loan for $50k As long as whatever rules you use produce positive results then you should be happy.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I think it is possible that resetting your target will help you gain extra profit from the month. I have tested this on a handful on months and found it to hold out but it's hardly conclusive testing. There are other way to increase the profit from the system and I have changed this strategy enough now for it to be confusing to others to post here what I have decided to forward test. I will however say the only way I have found this to be consistently profitable for me is to limit the drawdown in losing months. I believe this is necessary regardless of your chosen target. Remember if we lose 20% in January and make 20% in February we are still 4% down from the start of the year. If you go back through history you will see as cgrey has mentioned that there are many months where we lose (much of the last half of 2009 from memory). The key I believe, (as is true generally) is simply to cut the losers and let the winners run, 10% gain per month is a figure cgrey has settled on, and has hinted that his figure is no doubt different for each trader. cgrey has provided us with an edge (the 12 / 8 GMT candles) and a framework to profit from this (monthly targets). It is now up to us as individuals to profit based on our finances / risk tolerance / preferences etc. For example in my testing I am choosing to leave profits in the account to compound, you may choose to make a fixed / variable withdrawal at the end of each month. There are many factors that will affect how much money you win or lose on this or any system! dave.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi, I have posted above my opinion on this above - again this is only my opinion + testing on my tweaked version of this. I like your analogy of a puzzle, my puzzle currently is why I am unable to profit with this system before Jan 2007! What changed in the market around this date, what triggered it, and is a reversal on it's way?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Exactly - very well said. When you say "many months where we lose", are you referring to having drawdown before coming back to close the month out in profit? In 2009, by my testing, there were only two months that ended as net losers, but there were several that didn't make the 10% target, but still were net positive for the month. Overall, it was still an extremely profitable year (something like 65% if I recall)...

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market : "Foreign exchange trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010 and has more than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of retail investors as an important market " A lot of new traders creating a lot of new volume. They even gave us a pretty graph

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi, this may well be a mistake on my part - I have many versions of this system (capped drawdowns / different profit resets etc) with results recorded on spreadsheets. I may have been looking at the wrong thing. It's getting late here but I will check again in the morning so as not to mislead anyone. dave. edit --- you may well be onto something with that wikipedia link here is a pdf which goes into more detail: http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1012e.pdf hope it is of interest.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I have no doubt that your data is right. I just wanted to be sure we were talking about the same thing. For selfish reasons - we've already seen earlier what a huge difference spreads and the data feed make (Chris_B and I could be trading two entirely different systems based on our results so far for February). Since I'm getting ready to potentially go live with this on a different broker than all my testing (both forward and back) has been done on, I was more wondering if I'll see significantly different results. I didn't expect there to be much difference between brokers, but between what we saw earlier, and the possibility that the exact same set of rules may have created a lot more losing months for you than for me in 2009, now I'm not so sure...

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Cgrey, Just finished to read the full thread. Very interesting! My understanding is that MM is the key point here and that you are playing with volatility surge occuring at London open. As such, it would be interesting to check if the inverse strategy is profitable as well (i.e. selling when 8am is &lt;0am and buying when above 0am, keeping same SL and TP rules). If so, that would clarify why the system is profitable (volatility surge and excellent MM rules)... Regarding the 9 pip filter, has anybody checked what is the % of winning trades with gap &lt; 9 pips? Thanks. JP

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Ok, I'll admit it - I spend way too much time doing this stuff when I start enjoying reading reports like this one

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I still haven't wrapped my mind around which target is most feasible or if I want to recalculate the target after reaching it or at the beginning of a new month. At first I thought the 10% benchmark was best because cgrey explained during backtests that there were many months that didn't hit target, but were still net positive. Had the target been reached every month that was positive I would be very inclined to recalculate immediately after reaching target or setting a higher target (&gt;10%). Then dave (or Chris, don't remember who exactly) said there were many months that exceeded 10% with one month alone reaching +60%. I really don't want to put myself in a position to miss out on a 40%, 50% or 60% month. I know that sounds greedy, but I'm just thinking from a logical business perspective. Like I've said before, if the method is good enough to use to try reaching "X%" target, then why wouldn't it be good enough to continue after reaching target? But I do also understand cgrey's point about booking to cover what you need and then not risking loss. Yea I guess it all depends on what the person is looking for so in this rant I just answered my own question, lol.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I have to laugh because in reflecting on all the different ideas proposed and all the ways to improve this, I feel like the best way is the original one in post #1. We have gotten nowhere! lol. Just joking, I don't really mean 'nowhere' as in it has been a waste of time. I think we all understand the dynamics of this method better through discussing it and I look forward to future discussions. So what's everone's take on the gap thing?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
CGrey, I have been following this excellent thread for a while and have probably read/re-read the posts at least three times. I trade this currency pair (I live in UK) regularly and used your analysis and other posters' comment to profit from it. For example, today (16 Feb 2011) because of the 'Wednesday' threat I watched my trade like a hawk after going short at 8.00 GMT and closed early when I detected some trouble at 8.44 GMT with a 25 pip profit. (Mind you I could have made a 180 pip profit by 14.00 GMT if I had chosen not to close the trade but that is another strategy ). Please accept my sincere thanks for sharing your research like this. I really appreciate it. Kind regards,

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Glad you're taking something from it, Rasi.... Congrats!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I was curious about this too. So, when I first started my manual testing, I tried this. I was working backwards from December 2010, and gave up on this before I made it to January. I don't think there was a winning month in the first 6 or 7 months I looked at. Yes, the MM is definitely what makes this work, but it is combined with the probability that 08:00 moves back towards the 00:00 open more often that away from it.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
You are right....the inverse strategy doesn't work..even my backtest gave very very bad results...

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Following on from my post above about the last half of 2009, if anyone has time would you be able to post your results for october 2009? I have been through this month and I only find three days where we book a profit (1st 5th and 20th) with many SL's this month I am seeing a drawdown of 28%. June and July also show big drawdowns this year for me. Even just which days were BUY / SELL for you and the result would be useful. Tweaking the risk gives me around the same %gain as expected (60%) over the year as a whole but I am worried there is something fundamental wrong with my logic or datafeed to come up with a result so different from most. dave.

I dug out my spreadsheet (I backtested manually, without an EA). October 2009 had a tough start... We were down nearly 12% when we hit a 240 (!!) pip candle on the 23rd that wiped out the loss and hit our +10% all on the same day.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
hmmm, is this a BST issue then? See attached - the big candle on the 23rd isn't the 8 oclock but the 9 oclock (4 oclock OandA ) candle on my chart. I have also attached the 3oclock candle on the 20th showing our ~40pip gain that we have both recorded on this date for reference. Please excuse the colour scheme of the charts - they we just screengrabs from the strategy tester.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'll dig up the charts I pulled the data from... Wouldn't be impossible for me to have recorded the wrong candle - I did about 4-years worth of manual backtesting on the same afternoon. Hope that isn't the case, because as you pointed out, if that was the wrong candle, it would have definitely been a very bad month (Oct '09).

--- 帖子 #410 ---
congrats guys. we got 5 stars !!!! not that it matters, but it attracts lot of attention

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Doh! I didn't notice this until you mentioned it. Here's where we "jump the shark".... Prepare to be flooded with the junk that plagues most threads that we've been able to dodge until now. I was totally fine without any attention...

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Yeah... That 10/23/09 candle was 09:00. You are correct, Dave - that turned out to be a pretty bad month without that candle. I'm not sure that it would have stopped me from moving forward, though.. Limiting drawdown and managing risk certainly needs to be an aspect that each individual tailors to their comfort level. I've said all along, there will definitely be losses with this system, and there will definitely be losing months... This may have me looking at ways to manage this. Or, it may not, given that this system has never really been anything more than a side-project for me. But this is a good time to reinforce to anyone who is following along - you'll have losses if you choose to trade this. It's inevitable. How you deal with them is up to your tolerance. For some, that means they won't trade it at all. Others may cut and run at a certain point. I, personally, will never be at the point that I have a lot of capital invested in just this system, so I'm going to continue to ride it out for whatever it may give me... Be that a few dinners out per month, or the loss of a few dollars in pursuit of the gains...

--- 帖子 #413 ---
cgrey, maybe we should let the trade continue past 8 GMT if the next candle is going to be a big candle like this one in Oct '09. Okay that was a bad joke, but I have seen people suggest such dumb things before (not on this thread, but on other threads). That's exactly right. We will have losing months. It's part of the deal. That's why I have repeatedly stated it's not always going to be good or give you profit. I've been trying to make people realize this before they start booking vacations counting on the 10%. I think it would be a good psychological ploy if you drew up a contract for yourself which states something along the lines of: 'I promise to continue trading this method without hesitation and as per the rules until fully satisfied with profits, even if that shall be forever, or until substantial loss leaves me with "-x" account balance'. This kind of falls under "business plan". Just like you would sign a contract to perform a duty with a company, you should set this up for yourself to yourself. Be sure to make the worse case scenario (-x account balance) something reasonable and not something you can get in one very bad month or two. I would probably go with something like half my initial balance. My risk per trade would take many consecutive (or high percentage of losses) to reach that half of initial balance cut off amount I have set for myself. Of course the amount you set for cut off depends on your tolerances and preferences. Good luck all.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Start with "x" dollars. When the account grows by 50%, remove the original "x" dollars. Now you have half of what you started with in the account (but your original money safely withdrawn), but it's a totally free ride.... Fill in the "x" to your taste...

--- 帖子 #415 ---
... or .... Get really creative.... Start with $2000. Be conservative and shoot for 5% / month instead of 10% (lower your risk to minimize drawdowns or keep it the same and stop earlier ... whatever....). In 9 months, your balance will be $3000, take $1000 out. 8 months later, you'll be back over $3000 again. Take another $1000 out. In 17 months, you will have removed the entire $2000 you started with. In 3-years (from "day 1") your balance will still be over $5000, and this is with your original $2000 removed. See attached. You can play with the numbers in as many ways as you can think of to come up with a combination of risk to reward that works for you. The point, again, is to encourage creativity and putting together a plan. As 2+2 said way back near the 100th post, the power of compounding is amazing (paraphrasing Einstein, of course)

--- 帖子 #416 ---
This has been an absolute standout thread for me so far, I would say one of the 3 most important I have read to date. It is showing me that it is possible to create a strategy based on logic and probability to add MM with a 'business' mindset and totally automate it . EA's have never grabbed me before this thread, but now I can see how useful they can be as part of our trading. This strategy is a completely objective process, allowing the EA to do one of two things at 8:00 and book a profit or a loss at the end of the trade, The EA won't question it's self if it's hit SL 3 times this week, it doesn't know S/R levels - it will just trade! I have departed a fair amount from the system originally presented but have ended up with something I am comfortable letting lose on a small (tiny) live account, (1% risk per trade, DD capped per month) happy in the knowledge that it has returned 2% a month over the last 4 years. Regardless if it continues to perform, working through this process has been priceless. Thanks cgrey for the strategy, and your business mindset! Are you still trading the JPY straddle? I think I'm ready for another 2% a month!

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I've pretty much felt the same way about EAs. The difference here, as you've pointed out, is that there is absolutely no interpretation of indicators, or any discretion whatsoever involved. This is one of very few "systems" that can be said about - and therefore one of very few that an EA can trade with identical results as a "live" trader. Good luck, Dave - I hope this becomes successful long-term for you. Yep - another rare case. That EA has been going for close to 2-years now. It has it's share of winners and losers, but has been profitable overall, and I've long since pulled my initial investment out of that account, so it's also on a free ride. I take a little from it every few months, but if it blows up tomorrow, I've gotten my money's worth . I do feel a lot better about the potential for this system, though

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Well, we end this week on a positive note. All five of our trades this week were winners We went in to the week down almost 9%, and end the week up a little over 4%. We go in to the last full week of February within "striking distance" of our 10% monthly target. Updated journal is below:

--- 帖子 #419 ---
It hit -21 for me on Oanda demo account That proves to me that can not trust past results, as broker feeds are different. I have just started this account to test one trade a day, so i could put up a link to myfxbook if people like.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
On the OANDA demo I've been running parallel to IBFX in February, I had a loser as well: -22.4 pips. IBFX came within 0.2 pips of stopping out before it turned around. Again, it does prove the feed can make a difference on days like today when we get a move that goes really close to 20 pips against us. Using that result instead would have us up 1.2% for the month so far as opposed to up 4.37%. Another good week next week can still make our month. Even counting today as a SL instead of a small gain, this week alone made a net difference of over 9% for us (from down 8%+ to up 1%+). Beginning in March, my OANDA demo will become my point of reference, since I will also be taking this live with them when their MT4 platform is publically available to live accounts. I'll update post 1 in this thread with a myfxbook link to the account that will be used before the beginning of the month.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Well I like to think I am fairly quick on the trigger finger but on my broker(Alpari UK) today, by the time I had clicked on sell, ok for confirmation, my entry price was 1.61987 with stop at 1.62187. Got stopped out at that for -20pips. However actual open of candle on my chart was 1.62007 and high was 1.62198 so on back test or just eyeballing charts this would seem like small win, but in real life was total stopout. Wonder if this sort of thing would alter all backtesting stats. that have been done by cgrey and others. Just a thought. Geoff

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Sure - any difference in the actual order open as compared to what the order open should have been could cause a difference. Backtesting is done from data. There's no way to account for getting in late if you're clicking buttons, being slipped, etc... It's one reason I've never relied on backtesting for anything more than determining if the system is "worthy" of forward testing in demo. I know there are many people out there that consider backtesting to be the be-all and end-all when evaluating a system. I disagree, but to each his own...

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Thanks for quick reply cgrey, wonder if an EA would do it any faster. Geoff

--- 帖子 #424 ---
This is one of the rare cases I'd recommend an EA - takes the guesswork and errors out. There's still always the chance of being slipped, but when the only decision that needs to be made is which direction to trade (no interpretation of any indicators), an EA makes sense. There's one out there (check post #61).

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Don't want to harp too much on the EA subject, but have a question: anyone find the EA doesn't work as planned? I tried EA's long time ago (when I was a beginner ) and woke up many times to see my EA was made inactive overnight (like almost always). Sometimes my platform was disconnected or even shut down. I know it wasn't my computer or internet. When it comes to internet and computer I always have a relatively new machine and latest modem. These were the days when I used to be with Forex.com UK (Gain Capital). Funny thing was it would never happen when I didn't have an EA running. I feel like the broker has a way to shut down your EA if it is profitable. Maybe this just depends on the broker, but when so many brokers offer MT4 and promote EA's I wonder why?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Yeah, the broker plays a big part. And therein lies the problem - most brokers that use/support MT4, I would put on my "never use live' list. Whether they choose to or not, brokers can absolutely manipulate MT4 and your trades placed through it (whether they were placed by EA or manually). I'll stiop here, before this rapidly deterioates into a discussion about any specific broker. The short answer - yes, they can, and some do, mess with your trades. But a small few more reputable brokers (that I personally would trust) have begun offering MT4 lately.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
I have had a similar entry as well manually trading this in UK (Capital Spreads ). My entry price was 1.61979 timed at 08:00:04. However, my SL is set at 22 (I have added the spread) and therefore able to close at 09:23:21 with a small profit of 11.5 pips. It was a good job I didn't hang around any further . I have a slight bullish bias on GBP/USD at present, which means it is difficult for me to go against my instincts and go "short"; however it paid off today. Naturally it could have resulted in a total loss as it came very close to my SL. I guess we need to celebrate our successes too to keep our sanity in this business. Have a nice weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi Guys, I'm currently backtesting manually year 2001. So far, results are curiously very bad: up to August, only 2 positive months (10% and 3.5%). The other months stand between -10 and -18%. Will post detailled results once finalised, but it may takes some time.... JP

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I've gotta be honest... Whatever the results for 2001 are, being 10-years ago, it won't mean much to me, at least. Again, make your own decisions regarding the importance of backtesting to you. For me, the only value in it is to get us to the forward testing stage. What happened 10 years ago isn't likely to happen today. What happens today isn't likely to still be happening in 10 years. I usually cut off my backtests around 3-4 years, and make my decision to move forward based on that.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
For what it's worth, anything that happened prior to the 2008 economic meltdown is ancient history. We live in a different environment today.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Yea 2001 was a whole other world. Forex has changed alot since then and like cgrey said it will continue to change. We hope to exploit something that gives us an edge and then change as it changes. If the party comes to end then we move to another party.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Instead of using your live entry price, you can try MT4 price and then you can use your broker's spread to add on entry price (it seems you didn't add spread on today's trade). Because especially at 8:00 GMT, since the London market is opened, the moves are pretty quick and you may have slippage compared to ideal entry price which should be the MT4 platform where backtests and forward test are done, IMO. By using IBFX and Oanda (adding 2.2 pips spread) combo, today's trade wasn't stopped out and was a winner.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Yes. Makes sense... I would however definitely use max drawdawn per month in my MM.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I have created a new spreadsheet for people who would like to trade this strategy manually. The same spreadsheet can also be used for manual back testing purposes as well. I automated as much as I can. I would like senior pros like CGrey et al to have a quick look at it and tell me whether they would like to see any other information incorporated into this spreadsheet. Needless to say, I created this spreadsheet for my personal use and therefore take no responsibility for any errors or omissions if others decide to use it. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
excellent work. very good tool for ppl like me who are trading manually

Very nice - looks really good. I'm sure a lot of folks will benefit from this.

Good stuff Rasi, thanks. Just want to update a couple things on there, I think stop loss was triggered more than once, right? I also see the close price (9 GMT) for 2/18/11 is blank, but that can be calculated easily obviously. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Thank you for your feedback. I have corrected the missing data issues and also added a new tab for March 2011. I hope this helps. Please see the attachment. As I do not want this thread to be hijacked with my spreadsheet, I would appreciate if anyone want any further info on it to send me a private message instead. I'll do my best to help outside this very useful thread. Kind regards

New week starts tomorrow morning. With this past Friday being somewhat of a "split' (my IBFX demo gave us a small winner, my OANDA demo stopped us out), for the purposes of whether or not we make the target this month, I am counting Friday's LOSER as the trade. Below is the current trading journal for February. We have just under 9% remaining to hit our 10% goal for the month. Beginning in March, I'll be posting a new myfxbook link to track the progress in demo. I'll also be opening a small live account for this system effective March 1st. I also think I'm going to put the "9 pip rule" that we discussed earlier in play for both my live and demo accounts. Finally, more likely than not, I'll also begin to fade away from this thread around then, as there isn't much left to say about this system. I think it's pretty clear, there has been some good discussion and suggestions for improvement.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Regardless of President's Day in the USA, are we still trading today?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I was also wondering about holidays. This one is a US holiday therefore not as much impact (if any). How bout if we get a UK or European holiday? I personally won't trade it if it's a UK holiday.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
cgrey, in case you already dont know, oanda has started offering MT4 on the fxTrade accounts. i am planning to go LIVE on this from March

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks. Yeah, I saw they are offering them by invitation only. I requested one on Friday, maybe I'll get one in time I've also been considering a broker change for my main trading account. One of the new brokers I'm looking at offers somethng similar to OANDA's "sub accounts" which might also work for this. Thanks for the heads up!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi, I am signing up for this and will do some forward testing. I really like your MM approach. Maybe I am looking the other way, but I cannot seem to find the link to your Myfxbook. Where have you posted it? Or do you keep a journal at another place or at all? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #447 ---
There originally was a link in the first post to a myfxbook demo. Unfortunately, IBFX (where that demo was) apparently limits their demos to 30-days now - they used to be unlimited - so the account became disabled). Therefore, I removed the link. I've posted some screenshots of my manual journal for Februrary. Beginning in March, I will post a new link to a myfxbook journal for a new demo I'll be setting up for this system with OANDA (hopefully, that demo will not expire). From now for the rest of Feburary, the only "journal" will be my posts. Reults of forward testing for 2011 have been clearly documented in this thread thus far. To recap: January: +6% (this was from 11-January through 31-January) +10% would have already been hit before 11-January had we started from 1-January. Februrary: currently -1.33%. Depending on the broker, some folks are slightly up for February so far. Last Friday, the 08:00 candle moved just close enough to stop out on some brokers, but not far enough on others and reversed for a small gain. Early next week, I will be updating the first post to include the final results for January and Februrary, as well as the link to the new myfxbook tracking page.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Looking at the limited charts I have on this computer am at right now, looks like a slight gain on today's trade, +5-10 pips? Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
It was another REALLY close day (like Friday). I actualy stopped out, by 0.1 pips.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
On my demo it was within about a pip of stopping out. It was still a loss though of about 6 pips at the close of the candle.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Yea I was actually looking at a free internet chart (crappy) earlier and it looked like the wick of the 8 GMT candle got close to -20 pips, but I couldn't tell. On a side note, currencies were being strongly driven by fundamentals today. The Libya thing had oil skyrocket which carried over to the majors. Kiwi got smashed with the earthquake.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hi all, Couple of new things to say but please remember the below is only my opinion of how this system can be modified to make it profitable for me. All the below is based on leaving all profits in the account and compounding day by day - an EA makes the maths straight forward and allows testing of any time period with a given monthly target / drawdown. Anyway I've been having good success with a capped drawdown of 8% and combining this with a 1% risk per trade. This allows more failed days before we hit drawdown, as we know the key seems to be hanging in there for the big candle that will make target for us. This is working for me (in testing) and seems a safer way to play it. However - a couple of other fun things I have been spending some time on: Let our winners run - should we close at 9? what if we check for profit / loss before deciding what to do? How about adding to our winners? - this is where we can up the risk and hopefully the reward - what's to stop us adding lots as we start to see pips? Hmm so what if we put the two together and maxed the risk out to 6% a day and compounded $10,000 from Jan 1st 2007 to today? ...funny you should ask - see attached! -------------- Of course the astute will pass this off as nothing more than variables tweeked for best result on a set of fixed historical values. They would be right of course, they would probably also mention we should look at the drawdown and ask if we would trust a strategy to run our accounts down by over 60%? Very true, but they would be missing the point. In presenting these results I only intend to show what could be possible based only on the 12 / 8 candle relationship and the monthly money management provided to us by cgrey. How the profit and risk is managed is down to each of us. Are these results going to continue? Nobody can say, this system didn't seem to work at all before 2007, what is important to me is to look at what is happening NOW the same as with any trade we would take. Spend a couple of days on this and develop something from it that works for you. I think it is worth the time. So this EA is now available for the first 10 users at the reduced price of only $149 after this I'll be increasing the price to $299, so get in quick &lt;-- that's irony there... dave.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I have been thinking about this as well. Technically, US holidays should not affect the London trading as we are trying to exploit a particular pattern at the London market opening which is the biggest forex trading location in the world. Having said that, the market was quiet yesterday which was presumably due to the US holiday. Perhaps as an additional rule, we shouldn't trade during US and UK holidays. The UK holidays are usually at the month ends, which means they shouldn't affect the trading much (I'm hoping we would have reached our target by mid month ). For anyone interested, here is a link to the UK holidays: http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Governme...heUK/DG_073741 Regards,

--- 帖子 #454 ---
This will inevitably become a personal decision. 2+2 said he would not trade UK holidays. I, on the other hand, will trade them. Someone else had mentioned they will not filter trades out due to the "9-pip" rule, where I have already worked it in to my plan for going live. When I post my update in post 1 for March, I will identify several suggestions (including this one) that have come up along the way, and recommend people make their own decision on what to use and what not to.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
I was thinking it won't be worth trading on UK holidays because price might flatline for the whole hour and since we start in negative (spread), we might not get too far into positive territory. So figured it might not be worth the risk. However, I could be wrong because sometimes when liquidity is low price spikes drastically. Asia will still be in session, so maybe it is worth trading. Or maybe the best course of action is to see how price has acted over the previous 8 hours. If there was a wild swing then maybe sit out the holiday. If it has been flat, then maybe jump in because it is bound to jump (despite holiday). What I normally do is begin by trading the scenario in question and then stopping if I notice a pattern or have overwhelming evidence . I tend to learn and remember things better when they've cost me real money. (contrary to what I said before about not trading on UK holiday, but on second thought I will at least start out trading it)

Max SL has been hit for me on Tuesday and today

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I suffered maximum loss today as well, despite trading it manually. Yesterday I was able to make a 19 pip profit by not closing the trade at 9:00 GMT. I guess losses are part of trading and we should accept it.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi, Does anyone know a similiar pattern for another pair in another session? I am looking into it, but I have not noticed anything yet. The reason is that I would like an alternative trading option, since I am currently unable to trade at 8-9 GMT and I do not wish to use an EA. Thankful for any help. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #459 ---
i am following original rules, got 22 pips profit. max dd only 3 pips

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Which way did you enter today (long or short)? I stopped out, and it wasn't one of those days that was even close (at least on both of my demos).

--- 帖子 #461 ---
yeah I'm SL the last two days, up around 15pips on monday (my modified rules) so still down around 3% this week. However I had a few scalps that did very well for me so in total the (demo) account is up around 3%. It's hard for me to leave the EA to open and close the trades with no input from me but I keep trying to think long term. Instead of fiddling with it, low risk scalps on the same account is my answer. If I modify the rules to 1% risk per trade I can probably cap my drawdown for the month safely around 5-6% I'm 90% I'm going to go live with this now, combining it with small scalps will help me manage the risk even further. In a worse case scenario I need to scalp around 1.5% a week to make this essentially risk free for me, so fairly conservative. I'm thinking of a $200 account trading 0.01 lots will give me 1% risk for 20pips. After a month maybe add another $200 if it seems sustainable? What do you think cgrey, I have learned a lot from your attitude. Am I right in saying that you trade fulltime and aim for 10% per month?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Starting small is a good idea. Of course, that is totally up to your personal tolerance. "Small" to two different people can mean two different things entirely. In this case, it should be an amount you would consider safe to lose should you blow the account. As you said, you can always add to it later. Yes, I do target 10% per month return in my business plan. I manage my "real" trading account slightly differently, though, because I'm a long-term trader. My 10% target per month is based on "locked-in equity" as opposed to account balance. There are times when I will have positions open across monthly boundaries, unlike this system where we know we will be flat 23 our of 24 hours each day. Unlike what I've been preaching here, I don't close any positions because targets are reached. In fact, the vast majority of my trades will close by stopping out, but my stops are adjusted regularly, so they're (hopefully) always in profit when they do Conceptually, though, I think your approach is solid. Don't bank on the "scalping 1.5% per week", though. That can be a lot easier said than done. 6% per month from scalping takes a lot of talent. That's not to say that you don't have that talent, but take an honest look at your trading history (live and demo) and ask yourself if you've been able to consistently return 6% per month from scalping in the past. If you haven't, it may not be reaslistic to assume you will start to now, so you may not want to consider that as part of your overall plan. I tend to plan for "worst case", and anything better makes it a good month Aside from my fundamental-based trading, I trade a couple of other methods "on the side". I treat each one independently - analagous to "products", I suppose, using the business analogy. They each have their own trading account (with different balances). I don't assume I can supplement one with another. I think that can be a dangerous path to go down. Leads to emotion and over-trading one system (that's when mistakes start happening) to compensate for the losses of another.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hi, If we are on the lucky side one month, perhaps just a couple of pips away from reaching the target of 10 %, would we close our order when we reach 10 % or when the 08:00 candle closes as per the rules? I was looking through January and if we reached the target during the first 10 days. However when reaching the target, if the trade stayed open until 09:00 GMT, we would have gained 63 pips, only needing 5 pips, so the profit for the month would have been 17,7%. Archie

--- 帖子 #464 ---
You could adjust the target beyond the 10% to make the trade 1:1 risk:reward, or just be happy with what you have for the month. Really, it is up to you how you want to handle this. Don't think of the "rules" as something you must follow or horrible things will happen to you - use your best judgment for your risk tolerance, and make the system your own. If you're comfortable with the scenario you described above, by all means, do it.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi yeah I see what you are saying, worst case is very important. I'm thinking of 6% a month as a worse case as the EA wont open any more trades after 5% DD. Can I scalp 6% in a month? On a demo account, yes absolutely I'm almost certain of it. I probably didn't make myself very clear, up until now I have only been trading a demo account, this would be my first live account. So the $200 would be the first I have staked. I can expect 10% return on demo money a month if I spend around 2-3 hours per day trading, that is 4 or 5 days a week trading the London or New York opens. I'm in the UK so I'm lucky in that they are 8am and 1pm for me. Can I do the same on a live account - who knows! But I have found in my life most of the things people put down to skill / luck are based more on not giving up than anything else. I understand this is a little off topic but how did you transition from demo to live? Did you trade a tiny account before you went ahead and borrowed money from the bank? dave.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I am not sure how you managed that. According to my broker's feed: 0:00 GMT 1.6157 8:00 GMT 1.6196 9:00 GMT 1.6215 (High 1.6220 and Low 1.6192) Since the price at 8 GMT was higher than 0 GMT, the rules state we should go short. However, the price moved in the opposite direction. Have I misunderstood the rules? Can someone please confirm? Essentially, the hawkish MPC minutes published at 9.30 GMT pushed the GBP higher (the markets are expecting an interest rate rise sooner rather than later). Thanks,

The short version... I went live after close to 2-years in demo. During the early demo days, I had very limited time, so I was really only devoting an hour or two a day to trading or learning how to trade. When I opened the first live account, I was still basically trading "systems" based on indicators. I've always kept a demo open (and still do today) for testing new thigns before I incorporate them in to live trading. Yes, my first live account was pretty small, and I blew it up in about 6-months. Blew up a second one around a year later. Finally, by the third one (stll pretty small) I was beginning to get a little better at trading, and I was able to hold on to it. I slowly built that third account, both by compounding and regularly adding to it. About 4-years after I opened my first live account, the best and worst thing that could have happened did - I was laid off from my job. I had been planning to eventually transition to trading full-time for a living for about a year when this happened. Whether or not I was ready for it, I looked at it as my opportunity to become a full-time trader. With all my new free time, I began studying global economics and markets in general, and slowly transitioned my trading to fundamental based as opposed to indicator focused. That was right around a year ago. So, I visited my bank, got a loan to properly fund my business and since then, trading has been my business, full-time. My only regret is that I didn't get in earlier, rather than spending almost 25-years in corporate America before realizing my dream to be independent.

Hello everyone. Some nice comments today. Once again cgrey brings some solid advice and suggestions as to the business planning side of things. I also employ different strategies using separate accounts for each one. I think that's very simple, safe and prudent. This system is like every system that is profitable. It requires patience. Consecutive losses will happen. In fact, they will occur more often than single winners. Sure it would be nice to hit 10% in first couple days, but I can wait a few days/weeks longer . Dave, hats off to you if you can scalp 6%/month. Any tips you care to share? haha. I could probably profit some extra by scalping also, but that requires full attention and quite honestly don't think it's worth the time or risk-for-reward it requires. I rather set trades on the larger timeframes (daily and up) and check in once or twice a day. That's what makes this system attractive. All you need is half a brain and the ability to check in with your platform right before 8 GMT and at 9 GMT. With an EA you don't even need that much. This method also helps build a nice foundation for understanding money management.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Not sure I'm qualified to give advice! But I trade EURUSD because of the spread, usually around 1pip on OandA . I can't imaging trying to scalp with anything more than that. I have found PA very readable on the small timeframes, I use S/R levels, trendlines and candlestick patterns the same as someone on the 1HR chart would. On the 10sec chart they happen many many times in a session so I guess it's quicker to build up knowledge as you are seeing them so often. I also have MA's and a tweaked Stoch on a seperate M1 chart (my long term chart! ) to give me an idea of direction over the session. I have close to zero interest in any of the larger timeframes when trading with this method, but I make sure I know what news is due out, as the change in spread could easily stop me out. All pretty standard scalping theory I guess. I think one thing I think I may do differently is that I don't try to predict how big a move will be and set a fixed TP. If I can see a move I will enter and then take profit based on what price is telling me. Any real signs of weakness and I am out. On the subject - I've decided to man up and register with OandA as now I understand you can use MT4 on live accounts there is nothing stopping me running this live. So when I have been verified and transferred some cash (I think $200) I'll be scalping and trading my modified version live by EA. The changes I have decided to go with are: Risk at 1% per trade winners to run DD capped at 5% per month Also I may include my experiment to open extra trades based on how quickly price takes off. I will probably do this manually at first. I probably wont post my results here as the modifications I have made may confuse some people checking in for the first time. Perhaps just post if I have made 10% or lost 5% and see how this stacks up with everyone else. Anyway I just need to photocopy my driving licence now... dave.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
wow what a day! The logic in my EA was happy with the take off and opened another position for me. Unfortunately my wife isn't very well today so I've been looking after her and I haven't been able to check on the trades until about 20mins ago - I have closed both and taken about 2 x 20pips. I wonder how many of the 70pips I would have got if I had been watching? Still a bird in the hand and all that. dave.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Congrats, Dave. Perhaps a separate thread would make sense... I absolutely don't want to discourage you from posting results, but since this is clearly very different from the original system (and is being traded by EA), it may lead to confusion here... It would also give you an opportunity to expand upon your modifications while keeping us on topic in this thread.

6.5 pips for me on Oanda - manually taken as the ea sucks big time Anyone got a ea that works PLEASE

--- 帖子 #473 ---
understood sir, as I have said before I absolutely don't want to derail what you are doing here. This thread has really opened my eyes - honestly I can't thank you enough. You are doing exactly what I plan to - system (probability) based trades, looking for realistic gains that will pay off long term. I plan to have as many of these 'products' as possible.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
On OandA today I have the gain as 12.8pips on a M1 chart so depending on how quick it moved in the first few seconds, how long the order took to be place etc + the spread you might not be very far away. dave.

--- 帖子 #475 ---

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I'm definitely interested in what you've come up with. And I'd guess others are, too. Should you choose to elaborate in another thread, I will definitely be following - and feel free to link to it from here to show people where it is. Thanks for understanding how I'd like to keep things "simple" here.... We see far too many threads on FF turn in to 30 different versions of the same system - with each new contributor adding complexity, and after a while nobody can follow what is going on, and it becomes a huge mess. So far we've been lucky, but I'd like to try to keep this as "generic" as possible...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Now that we're several hundred posts in to this thread, now would be a good time to remind people of my request in post 1. Please DO NOT post any EA in this thread. If you develop one and want to share it, I have absolutely no objection - just create a new thread for it, please.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Nice to see some folks had some success today by taking the concept and working with it to their taste. Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Cgrey and All. Many thanx for a wonderful thread and community. Have just finished reading all and am up to date, phew! I am sorry but I have a newbie question to ask; How do you 'back-test' so far? My broker 'igindex' will only go one month back? Once again, Great Thread

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I back test with MT4 strategy tester - if you go to tools / history centre you can download the data for the pair you are interested in (GBP/USD) in this case. dave.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
cgrey and all, just to update... I got an email saying MT4 live is available on OANDA : You are receiving this email because you signed up for an OANDA MT4 invite. We are happy to announce that the OANDA MT4 platform is now available. Here are the steps needed to set up your OANDA MT4 account: 1. Sign into the Fund Management System to create an fxTrade account enabled for MT4. (Specify your account details, then check the "Enable this account for MetaTrader 4" box under Advanced Options.) 2. Fund the MT4-enabled account. 3. Download the OANDA MetaTrader 4 software. (This software is the same for both fxTrade and fxTrade Practice; you only need to download it once.): http://www.metaquotes.net/files/oanda/mt4setup.exe 4. The downloaded exe file will install on any Windows system. Double-click the file from a Windows machine to install the software. 5. Use the account number and password of your MT4-enabled account to sign in to the MetaTrader 4 software. (Be sure to select "OANDA - fxTrade" from the list of servers that appears.) Let us know if you have any questions, comments or general feedback about OANDA MT4. Kind Regards, OANDA fxTrade Team www.fxtrade.oanda.com

thanks 2+2. Got the same Email this morning... Gotta try to get to the bank tomorrow to send a wire to get my account funded. Hopefully, they will apply the funds same-day. Would really like to be able to start March from the 1st... ==== Edit: Doh! Bank wires take 1-2 days to process by OANDA, then another 1-day to get in to your account. It may be as late as Wednesday....

--- 帖子 #483 ---
This is exactly what I was thinking - I still have to be verified so I very much doubt I'll make it. who's betting that 8am candle on tuesday is 250 pips!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Yeah, I think it will be one more month of demo before taking this live for me. I've been talking to another br0ker (bank, actually) that I'm very seriously considering moving to. I'd be able to set up sub-accounts with them for this and a couple of other distractions, to keep them separate from my main trading, but still under the same umbrella. And based on my balance and volume, I'll get pretty decent pricing. I'm probably going to end up going that route (there are several benefits over OANDA for me, at least). I can wait another month. Since OANDA demos don't expire, I'll still use one of them for the myfxbook "journal" for this system.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I'm really on the fence about this, because I'd be opening up a whole can of worms and probably creating a lot of work for myself.... I am tempted to create a new thread, in which together we will build an EA for this system. I am by no means a programmer, but I have written a few simple EAs, including the one that trades this system for me. There have been requests for an EA, and while I know that roundrock has already made one available, there are still people still asking for one. I would want it to be a learning experience, though... Not just attaching the file and saying "here it is" - but actually writing the code, in parts, over several days (after all, this is about the simplest EA you could possibly ever write) and explaining what each section actually does. This would require people put in at least a little effort, and for those that may be interested in creating their own EAs for other systems, it might be a good starting point to introduce them to the concept of programming an EA. It would NOT be a programming thread, as much as it would be specifically targeted at creating an EA for THIS system, and frankly, I'm not competent enough with coding to take it too far anyway. It would require people do some work on their own, again, to take the basic concepts that would be presented, and figure out how to change it for their own needs. I dunno - I'm going to sleep on this and see how I feel about it in the morning. I'm feeling like giving something back after these past few days. World events, sad as they have been, have led to a nice profit for me this week... This could be a way for me to give something more to this thread.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
For your information, I have forward tested this strategy since 1st Feb until now and not producing positive results. I would advise anyone to do a full test on this strategy at least 2 months before you go. I have written an ea for this and not going to further develop until someone claim that this strag is working in his results. Sorry this was delayed as I do not have time to post until now. The following ea is done in shortest time possible before further tuning it to be more user friendly as it has not yet proven (forward test) profitable. Parameters to be set: ServerGMT: can be positive or negative number, calculate your broker GMT/UTC differential (note the daylight savings). MagicNum: an unique number to track this group of opened/closed trades LotDecimal: some broker does limit the lot size decimal to 1 only. Example: have it set to 2 if your broker accept 0.01 USD1_PerPip_LotSize: this is to calculate micro/mini/etc. Put in a lot size that one pip = USD 1.00 profit. StopLossPips: leave it as default which follows ggrey strag, read 1st post. Targeted_Net: put a 10% based on your equity to the month's target, currently you have to do this manual every beginning of the month once. StopLoss_Risk: (percentage) leave it as default which follows ggrey strag, read 1st post. StopLoss_Pips: leave it as default which follows ggrey strag, read 1st post. As requested by cgrey, I have to remove the perfect ea following the exact strategy and TIMING. Please PM me if you need the ea, I have limited privilege to start a new thread. *Junior Member* or someone else pls start a thread for me to post it.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
However, I will do a final test on March and April for this strag and have a live result link here on the go when the time comes. I can't present my current Feb results as its a combination of a few test. My server has limited resources...

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Yes, February has not been a good month thus far. Clearly, you have not read the entire thread and seen the results that several people have posted back through 2007. I have mentioned several times in this thread, that I would prefer that no EA be posted here, but rather in their own thread. Please remove the EA from your post, and open a new thread for it. If it remains, I will remove your ability to further post in this thread.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I will start a thread for the EA. Just what I need -9.6 for me today manually traded

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Thank you. That thread appears to be here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=282208 Pleae keep any discussion specific to this EA in the above thread.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
This probably wasn't the best idea. After thinking more about it, with very few notable exceptions, people don't want to learn - they just want things handed to them. Sadly, there's plenty of evidence around us here and in other threads, that most folks would get very little from the excerise, and simply just want to download the completed work. There is already an EA out there, and just today, someone else said they'll post another one. I do not 'endorse' either, nor have I personally reviewed them to confirm they accurately represent the system as it has been presented. But, they're available, and in the end that is probably all that the vast majority of people want. Don't ask in this thread for any "support", from the authors or me. That's why they're in separate threads. I plan to update the first post this weekend with some of the stuff that has been discussed over the past couple of months to try to summarize the thread. I will then move back to being more of a "lurker" on FF. There's a reason I don't post much - If/when I have something new to share that I feel can make a difference, I'll open a new thread for it. If I discover anythng related to this specific system that may interest people, I'll share it here. Until then, I will continue to silently check in now and then on this thread. Hopefully, it won't deteriorate like so many others have, and future posts remain on-topic and have substance.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
cgrey, I agree with you that it is not a good idea. However, I hope we will continue to discuss the original idea and how it can be developed/enhanced to produce consistent profits for participants. Overall, I the thread quality is good and hope it stays that way. I have already setup a new account to trade this idea, which I will be trading manually with a few amendments. Today I traded the new account and got out within ten minutes with a 2 pips profit (I wanted to start with a profitable first trade ). I will share my trading results if I feel it is appropriate to the thread. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #493 ---
cg, regardless of how this thread continues thank you for starting it - it's been of huge importance to me. I took the 12/8 candle concept and the 10% a month pip target from this thread and made it work for me . I couldn't have done this without your initial findings. To those unsure of it's credibility - I have back tested this system with the tweaks I have noted (the key for me the capped DD and the management of winners) back to Jan 2007 and it has been profitable year on year.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
You're welcome, Dave. And thanks for sharing your contributions as well. I find it rewarding when something I share can be of benefit to others. I hope you have continued success with yoru adaptation of this.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I've run a couple of threads myself. Never a truer word was spoken than what you just said. Wish you continued success.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I actually thought it was a good idea cgrey cause I don't even know how to use an ea in the first place. So learning to program one and put it to use would benefit me. But no worries I am sure if I want an ea for this I can learn how to program with the use of the internet. I was hoping you would go back and revise your first post with your final version of how you are going to execute this trade. So thanks for doing that. Also, I know you don't want a lot of clutter and this might clutter it to much. But if everybody that is going to trade this strategy with a sleight variation from your revised strategy, "example 1% risk per trade and max dd of 6% a month" write out how they are going to trade it and you list in the first post what post number that variation is on it might help. Anyway just a thought and again I thank you for the time you have contributed to this thread. Branden

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Post #1 has been updated.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Never mind cgrey you basically covered everything in your revised post. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Absolutely. The simplicity of the "rules" probably means there is less to be discussed than with some other systems, but I would love to see discussions continue when something relevant is uncovered. Best of luck. I'd probably do a few things slightly differently if I were trading this manually, I just can't get up at 3am (maybe I'll pack up the family and move to London some day).... I believe strongly in not giving anything back, so congrats on your 2-pips. Any winner is better than a loser. I hope you have continued success....

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Thanks Steve. Yeah, truth be told, this thread has really gone pretty well to this point, as far as staying on topic and keeping things civil. Better than I was hoping for, even.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Sorry, dt... I know there are a few like yourself that this would have probably worked out for. But, that said, there are a lot of threads right her on FF that can help you get started. And, I'm far from a programmer... We would have developed about the simplest of all possible EAs (from a programming perspective, this system really is a snap), but there would have been a LOT left untouched that someone would have to go seek out if they wanted to continue with more complex EAs someday. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't have the programming knowledge required to advance that topic very far beyond having a working EA for this system.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hello cgrey. Hello all. This thread has stayed on topic for the most part. It's refreshing to have a thread where the conversation has been consistent. Big ups to cgrey for policing and for reminding everyone to keep focus on the target. Also big ups to the posters on here for adhering and respect. This strategy is simple, so it's very easy to make it go off topic. Since none of us want that either, I can see this thread becoming more of a log. A place where we can come post our results and see how it comes to others doing pretty much the same thing. I kinda like that too. Makes it easy to read and catch up. It also makes it unique compared to the other threads on here. No matter where it goes from here, it can at least be a rally point for those who were here from the begininng, hehe.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
We should get t-shirts made, or a banner or something...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
N It's no problem at all. You touched on a point about not giving anything back a couple posts back. How would you change your strategy if you traded this manually? Another note kinda off topic. I started trading live yesterday. I was up 80 pips and gave most of them back. (I know I'm a tard) Anyway your mm in this thread has helped me out a ton besides your system that you shared. Thanks again and I hope to see more posts from everybody in this thread.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
The biggest difference would probably be that I'd make a decision at 09:00 whether or not to close the trade based on how price has moved during the 08:00 hour. A while ago I had been trying to come up with some kind of idea to approach this logically so it could be worked in to a "rule", but I've yet to come up with anything that can substitue for instinct and simply "watching" market movement. I'd probably also find opportunities now and then to close manually before the full 20-pip SL was hit in trades that aren't going our way. Of course, both of these bring discretion to the system, and there's no guarantee that the end result would be any better...

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Gotcha. I have also wondered about letting it run but you never know since its forex. I like the cut and dried make/break/or get out rules. For the guys that can backtest with an ea and not do it manually, have you tested what happens if you stay in the trade 2 hours instead of one? If nobody has time I understand. If I have time I will try to manually do it this weekend. I do think you will have a lot more sl hit and tp hit. Just depends on the ratio I guess.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Just by manually backtesting, I've seen the answer to that is "somewhere in between". There are many times the gain would have been greater. There are as many, or more, times when a winner at 09:00 ends up a loser at 10:00. Would be curious to see some data as opposed to just the visual, though...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
One more thing about mm. I am not going to open a separate account if I trade this system. I still haven't decided yay or nay on it. Since I would be using the same account that I am making other trades on, would you guys suggest going for a pip target or a % target? I would still up/down my lot size so I wasn't risking more then 1 or 2 percent per trade. (whatever I decide on) If I went the pip route this is how I was thinking about it. Target of 80 pips. When I reach it I reset and go for another 80 pips. If I dd 80 pips I reset and go for a fresh 80. Or I set a goal of say 8% if I risk 2%, and every 8 gmt trade I would adjust lot size for my risk of 2%, and keep track of my % profit loss on this trade. If I dd 8% I would reset and start fresh. Example, if I am up 4.37% on my first trade then I would set my tp for 3.63% of my account balance the next 8 gmt trade. Even if I had a dd of 5% from other trades. Are there any negatives of trading this on the same account as other trades besides the extra math? And are there any negatives of using either the 80 pips strategy, or the 8% strategy? I apologize if any of these questions are redundant. Branden

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Short answer - go for pips instead of % - the math will become WAY too confusing if you try to keep track of %. The trick, then, is that you figure out your lot size at the beginning of the month (or 80-pip cycle), and don't change it for that entire cycle. Keep track of you total pips (+/-) for only this system. All of this said, I would advise strongly against mixing systems in a single account. With brokers out there that will let you open an account with as little as $50 (or even less) there's no reason to mix them and make things more confusing. Plus, if your other system(s) start to do particularly good (or bad), that will mess with your math, too. In the end, you won't be able to keep accurate records of how this specific system worked for you, and therefore you'll be less able to make an informed decision about whether or not to continue to trade it long-term.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
LOL. Oh man that was good. Almost pissed my pants.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
No way to know for sure which way the ball is going to roll. So don't be hard on yourself if you were up and ended with a loss. That 80 pip gain can turn into +150 pips. Truth is you can't take a partial profit because in the long run it will cost you more. If I have one tip for you it is make your trade and walk away from your computer. Come back when it's time to come back. In the case of this strategy, one hour later. Just don't think. That's the beauty of this system - you don't have to think. Hence my earlier analogy that even a person with half a brain can do this. So, set the trade, walk away, then come back when it's time to close. Like my signature says: trade like a machine. I wouldn't always reccomend trading with such rigid parameters, but that's what this system is based on. The combination of rigid parameters with a an edge is what will make this profitable (if it does profit. Recent history suggets it has). I haven't been trading this system. The hours where I live don't allow me to and I have Oanda so I can't plug in an EA. However, I have taken the core principles of this system and applied it on a "higher" level. By "higher" I mean larger timeframe. Without giving specifics, I'm looking for patterns on daily, weekly and monthly charts upon which to draw an edge. As a result I have widened the stops and take profits (as compared to this hourly system). Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I see SOOOOO many threads here: "TP1, TP2, TP3". They're exactly opposite of good money management. When you're up and the trade is moving your way, the last thing you want to do is take $$$ off the table.... If you're going to have TP1, TP2, TP3 - just have one - TP3. Your win will be much bigger. If you are not confident your trade will make it to TP3 (or if TP3 doesn't give you an adequate risk:reward (like 1:2 or higher), then it's not a trade you want to be in. Sit it out and wait for the next one. But don't reduce your profits by scaling out of positions. Let your entire position run until it's time to exit. If you want to "lock in" profits, move your stop accordingly, but when you start taking $$ out of your trade, you're effectively reducing the value of every pip the trade moves further in your direction. You end up needing twice (or more) as many pips to have the same $ profit. Too many people scale out, when they should be scaling IN instead. If you want to be in with one full lot, start by going in with 1/2 (or 1/3). When the trade starts moving your way, add to your position. If it goes against you, you'll be out with a much smaller loss than if you went in with your entire position from the beginning. Another reason why 95% of all retail traders fail. You see these two common mistakes time and time again in systems here - often even from the "good" or "experienced" traders. I've said it before, and it's worth repeating. It's amazing just how well some of the mediocre systems you see here would do if they had halfway decent money management. Some that have been abandoned as failures only need to apply solid money management concepts to turn them into profitable systems. If you learn anything from this thread, it should be how to apply proper money management in all your trading - not which direction to enter G/U at 08:00.

Today's 45 pip win ends the month of February down just a bit (-0.35%). Post #1 has been updated.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Cgrey, because of the 9 pips rule I did not trade today. Are you planning to change your thinking on this new rule in light of today's results going forward? I know the same rule would have saved you 26 pips on February 9th. Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Like Rasi, I did not trade because of the 9 pips rule... Also, if we took the 1.00 candle we would have a short trade...

--- 帖子 #516 ---
No, with both my demo and live trading beginning in March (starting tomorrow), I will be employing the 9-pip rule and not trading if the distance between the two opens is less than 9-pips.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
i am planning to go LIVE tomorrow with my oanda mt4

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Good luck RR... I'm live as of tomorrow as well - still keeping the demo for (public) record keeping and any tweaks that may still be undiscovered....

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi lousa, You are correct about the 1 GMT candle. It would have been the wrong call today . Despite not trading today and not making any money, I am going to stick to the rules. I am sure such discipline will pay-off in the long term. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Of course, if you had chosen to do both (the 9-pip rule and the 01:00 candle), you wouldn't have traded today either, since that difference was also smaller than 9-pips. But, Rasi is correct - when you choose what rules you will play by, stick to them (disciplne). Don't change the rules in the middle of the game.

Very interesting month. Started with small live account of $1000 and 5% risk per trade on daily account balance(this is ok for me as risk tolerance).No 9pip rule. So, 20 trades taken, 9 wins, 11 losses, largest drawdown in month was 15% of starting balance and ended month on +10.9% of starting balance. So all in all not too shabby. On a different note I think the reason this sort of works is because its london open at start of 8am gmt candle, In a couple of weeks when British Summertime starts 8am gmt candle will be one hour after london has opened, I will monitor candle at london open and candle at 8 gmt and let you know results . Good luck to all starting with this live tommorow. Geoff

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I'm certain London open is the reason this works. The interesting bit is that in my backtesting to 2007, I never made any changes to accomodate for daylight time changes. Several others that backested also mentioned they made no changes around this. I forget exactly how far back, but we did discuss this for a page or so early in the thread.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi everyone. Have you checked to see how much you would be up had you taken the trade opposite direction? I wonder since it was 9 wins vs 11 losses. I know some of the same trades would probably still get stopped out, but just curious.

SL hit today and boy am I having problems with Oanda MT4 platform. Getting off quotes continually

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I understand where you are coming from. However, one cannot change the trading rules that were devised using around three years of data, because of 20 trades. The interesting point to note is that based on the original rules, the losses were negligible last month (-0.35%). Geoffrey62 made a profit of 10.9% using a 5% risk per trade. My trade today hit the SL as well by sticking to the rules. The annoying thing is that I knew when watching the charts (I trade manually) that I needed to go "long". Such a trade would have resulted in a 34 pip profit. Better luck next time I hope.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Wasnt todays trade a long? The 00:00 open price was lower than the 08:00 open price? I havent started trading this system yet maybe im missing somethign

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Yup, you're missing the 1st post

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Today I went with the 01:00 opening so it was long for me, sweet 33 pips

--- 帖子 #529 ---
You should be trading back toward the 00:00 opening price. So, when 08:00 open is higher than 00:00, you go short.

Seems like myfxbook doesn't like OANDA MT4 accounts. I don't know if it has something to do with all the "interest" entries, or what the cause is... But, we clearly did not lose 40,000% in the first trade of the month like myfxbook is reporting. 2.5% loss today (SL hit). I'll see if there's anything I can do to fix that...

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hey, that was cheating. Well done .

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I was not suggesting nor implying we change the rules. In fact, I've been a proponent of following the original rules unless there is overwhelming evidence to tweak them. I only asked because I was curious. I know the results are not going to be better (over last few years) because in all the backtesting by cgrey and others, it would of stood out like a sore thumb if it was better to take opposite direction. The edge is the reversal from the 0-8 GMT and I know that. The reason why I'm curious is because if the opposite trades finish the month with a small loss (or slight gain), then its a testament and confirmation of the money management.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I was thinking the exact same thing. Also the reason why Geoffrey62 and cgreys results are opposite could not be because of using a higher % risk I don't think. It has to be on some of the days cgrey took a full 2.5% loss when it hit his stop, compared to a few of the guys that it came close but didn't stop out and retraced. I'm not great at math so maybe it is because of the difference in % that they used. I'm sorry I didn't have time to backtest and see what the results would be if you left the trade open for a full two hours instead of one. This is the best thread I have read on ff cause its so clean. Not really any bs. Thanks again everybody for your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Just an update on my results for february, on a couple of trades I was a tiny little bit late getting in on open of 8am candle due to broker giving me "Trade Context Busy" nonsense. so I took price that I got in at not price of open of candle, and used these prices in my trade log. Had I used actually price my results would have been slightly better, but we must live in real world not demo world so my results were as previous post. Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #535 ---
we just hit SL and then price moved up !! started the month with 2 SL

--- 帖子 #536 ---
RR, same result for me... And last week this happened to me at least one day... It seems the market knows where we are, goes there to take us out, then moves away... The good thing: this is demo...

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Not sure what happened to CGrey's GU trade today; his fxbook log shows a 70.5 pip win for a buy trade which lasted nearly 2 hrs ....?? No SL or TP either.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
OANDA's MT4 sucks, is pretty much the short answer. After it accepted the trade, it couldn't be modified or closed. I had to close it manually - when I woke up a few hours later. My EA tried to close the trade literally every tick for a solid hour at 09:00 and kept getting "off quotes". I'm SOOOO glad I didn't decide to go live with OANDA - I think they still have some bugs to work out with their MT4 platform. In my live account, it was another SL.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I have watched the open a fair few times on the OandA 5 second chart and this is one thing I have found. If price doesn't take off Tony112 style then what it will often do is a quick 5 pip hop one way before continuing the 'right' way. You can sometimes see it on the M1 chart too. Entering at 8:00:30 or 8:01 would give us some more breathing. If price is taking off it shouldn't make a deal of difference on good days. It does improves things this year if we believe mt4 backtesting data and I'm planning to test this over a decent time period when I get chance. I had a problem with OandA this morning which may or may not be related to the EA I am using - 3 positions were opened at 8:00 this morning. Only one appeared in MT4 but the all showed in fxtrade (I didn't know this at the time as I didn't have it open). The MT4 log showed 2 of them failed to open so they didn't end up with a TP / SL as with OandA you need to do this after you have opened the trade. The end result is that I was running 2 trades I didn't know about with no SL! This could have been a disaster. I've had the problem with ghost trades appearing in MT4 stopping me opening new trades but this could be a lot more serious. As it happened it worked out really well for me this morning as trade 1 was stopped out 8:41 probably the same as everyone. But trade 2 and 3 lived on! I only saw them when I looked at the charts around 11:45 and added a tight trailing stop and got out around 1.631. Has anyone else using OandA found anything like this happening? cgrey in order to keep the thread clean would it be possible to message me with the logic for the open trade snippet from your EA. I'd like to rule out anything I am doing wrong at this end.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
just the seen cgrey's above post! looks like they still have some bugs to work out. hmmm.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
yes i also faced same issue with another EA. It has some phantom trades that appear in MT4 but not in fxTrade. its a sync issue... anyway i will do this system manually. we just need to place only one order and another to close. i can live with 10-20 sec delay because of manual trading. in fact today i thought of placing couple of pips below the recent support but that would have extended ny SL to 25. if i had done that i would have survived the trade and ended up with a decent profit. respecting recent s/r line is crucial aspect

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yeah... I'll send you the specific code for my order opening later this evening (I'm going to be out most of the afternoon today) but it really is a simple OrderSend() first, followed by the OrderModify() to set the "safety" TP and SL. Everything failed for me today after the first OrderSend(). Managed to get the order in, but couldn't modify it after several tries, and had more failed attempts to close it, both at -20 pips and then again at 09:00, than I could count in the journal. I doubt the problem is your code. I have seen many other issues so far as well, but today was definitely the worst of them. The demo for this system worked for the most part in Feburary (though it wasn't the one I was tracking). The "ghost" orders have been a real issue. According to one of my demos, I have both a long and short open for the same pair, which is really great, since they don't allow hedging .

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I have yet to use their MT4 since it's new to them. I have had no major problems with their fxtrade platform, so I will continue to use that (even though I'm not trading this strategy because of the hours). Dave, what do you mean by "take off Tony112 style"? Never heard of that before. Hope I don't sound like I live under a rock, haha.

--- 帖子 #544 ---

2+2, Dave is referring to Tony112's thread (central banks and big players) Check it here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=156106 The rules are: entry on E/U taking the initial direction of the market at london and NY opens. Initial SL is 2 pips including spread (this system needs spread 0.9, unusual these days) TP is 140, 200, 600 pips, whatever... So, if price does not take off imediately, he is out of the market with 2 pips lost... And yes, you live under a rock. The thread will be two years old in two days. No offence, just kidding...

On my platform it came within .5 pip of the sl and turned around for profit.

I once again removed the myfxbook link from the first post. OANDA 's demo is a mess, so this won't be an accurate representation anyway. I'm not going to link my live account to myfxbook, so you'll just have to trust me for the results. Hey, it's one trade a day... You can just as easily verify the results for yourself in about 10-seconds. Currently for March, 2011: -4.96%

open GBP/USD sell order at 1,6291

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Not sure what system you're trading! It should have been a BUY at around 1.6318. Closed up a pip or so at 09:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Just checked the candles and it appears like a small gain or breakeven as you suggested.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Small gain or loss, depending on spread. I had a net loss of 0.6 pps.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Well, I'm totally done with OANDA's MT4 demo now. I have three different demos. Right now, in one of them, I still have two open orders for the same pair in opposite directions. They have appeared and disappeared throughout the day. In the second, I can't place any orders - nothing but "off quotes" when I try. In the third, I have been trying to close an open order, and the platform just hangs - no message at all. Too bad, I really had nothing against OANDA. This is the first experience I've had with them since having a small live account with them a few years ago. This time around, I didn't use their fxtrade platform, since I was focused on having MT4 to run my EA for this system - I'd imagine it is still a decent platform. But they are definitely not serving the purpose I had in mind this time around, so I will get a new demo opened elsewhere for the rest of this month. I just don't have it in me tonight, so tomorrow's trade will be a "paper" trade - I'll calculate what would have been based on the current balance as of now.

--- 帖子 #555 ---

42 pips profit today. be for month

Four days into month of march and have hit my +10% of starting balance. All rules same as before(post521) 4 Trades 1 loss -20pips 1 win for 1 pip 2 wins +61pips. Thing is, what to do now? Cgrey advises having rest of month off, which I think is probably the right thing to do, but we still have about 15 or so trading days left in month, seems a shame to let them pass by. What to do...... What to do...... Have a good weekend to all and once again many thanks to cgrey for good, simple way to trade. Geoff

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Yep, you know what I'd do. 3 weeks left in the month, and I've already hit my goal - sounds like vacation time to me. Obviously, the approach is different when this 10% represents 10% of a small account. Remember, my 10% is my single source of income for them month (not with this system, but my overal trading "business". Once I hit 10% in my real trading, that's the equivalent of getting all my paychecks for the month if I had a real job. You mean you'll pay me for the whole month on the 4th and I don't have to show up for work again until April 1st? Yea, I'll take that..... Way to go, Geoff... I've still got a ways to go.... 9-pip rule filtered out today's trade for me, which was a nice one. I'm sitting just around -5% so far for March.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I thought I'd share my results so far with the system. I am following the original system to the point, even though I am working on ways to adapt it to my trading situation. I am looking into trading with a little less risk, perhaps 1% instead of 2,5% to decrease DD. I little more testing is required before I add this to my other live systems. Jan +16,26% (last trade took me a good bit over the goal) max DD -2,54% Feb +3,28% max DD -6,58% March (to date) -0,81% max DD -5,60%

--- 帖子 #562 ---
i am also following 9 pip rule but i got a trade and made 42 pips !!! the pippette saved me today. also using EA helped me. the gap is 9.4 pips on my feed. GMT0 open 1.62742, GMT8 open 1.62836 if i had done a manual trade probably it would have been filtered by 9 pip rule. i am not saying 9 pips is very scientific number, its just a number picked during backtesting. but once you pick it stick to it

--- 帖子 #563 ---
The Math says that the system works (ie small losses while we wait for the big gain) while you will be risking $$ to keep trading, you are planning to risk those same $$ next month. The choice is really do you risk them now or later. To me that is an easy choice since I believe the system will work the same now as it will next month. [QUOTEthat's the equivalent of getting all my paychecks for the month if I had a real job. You mean you'll pay me for the whole month on the 4th and I don't have to show up for work again until April 1st? Yea, I'll take that.....][/quote] If by "showing up to work" you mean setting one trade a day with no further research required.... Then I'll keep showing up to work and make more money

--- 帖子 #564 ---
With TP being based on target for the month do you start a 'new month' when you have hit 10%? Why have you decided to do this instead of aiming for 15% or 20% or 200% in march? dave.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Some choose to set a goal or business plan and follow it to a tee. If the 10% is what you will use to pay bills, then it may be too risky for you to continue. I personally would continue and recalculate after each 10% hit, but I don't use that money to pay bills nor is it used to run or grow a business. How did today go?

Some people prefer to cap at 10%. This is a personal preference that I respect. However it does nothing to grow or kill a business. I guess I could be wrong about this but I don't see any companies around me that shut the doors when they hit their profit goal for the month.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
If you've survived in your own business for 7-years, you almost certainly have a solid business plan. I'll further speculate that your business plan contains some provision for managing risk. How you manage that risk will be different for different types of businesses. Some businesses are riskier by their nature than others. Very few other businesses leave you as open to failure as quickly as Forex does. Every single trade you make, if you haven't properly analyzed the risk and taken measures to minimize it can put you out of business - the wonder of leverage (among other things)... The simplest way to manage risk is to not trade. Obviously, you can't succeed if you are not in the game - so this is where the concept of hitting a target and eliminating any further risk comes in, for me at least. Other traders may have other strategies for minimizing their risk. But rest assured, Forex is one business that you can be guaranteed to fail in if you do not have some type of risk management strategy, whatever it is. Given the nature of this business, there are a lot fewer options than more traditional businesses. Many professional traders will half-jokingly tell you the best months they've had are the ones they didn't trade Conversely, profit margins in most "traditional" businesses are slim compared to the potential Forex offers. How many small businesses (I'm talking about 1-man shops here, which Forex is) would shut down for a few weeks each month if they could once they've covered all of their expenses (salaries and projected savings and growth included) for the month? It's another one of the beauties of Forex - no customers, no expectations that your store is open 7 days a week from dawn to dusk or that as a consultant or service provider you are always available to your clients. If you want it, you have total freedom - something even most traditional business owners don't experience. I choose to have my cake and eat it too. My Forex business provides more for my family than my salary after 25-years in corporate America did. And if I have a particularly good week, I can (and many months have) "worked" as little as 6 or 7 days some months. You're right, it's a personal preference - so far this has worked for me Depending on whose numbers you believe, as many as 80% of businesses that are started in the US fail within the first 5 years. The companies you see around you represent the one out of five that actually had a plan to keep their risk under control and survived to see another day (or, have been extremely lucky, which is another thing that helps in the Forex business).

--- 帖子 #572 ---
... I've been trying to think of a better comparison.... While I've been saying you need to treat your trading like a business, Forex really is very different from a traditional business in many ways. For one, most traditional businesses will have a forecast / budget for a month. This means the owner knows, with a reasonable degree of certainty, what their expenses and receipts will be for the month before it has started. If you trade without a plan for when to STOP trading for the month, you don't have that. Every trade is potentially an expense. In a traditional business, you run very little risk when keeping your doors open another day. You've already figured your inventory (or supplies, or whatever your cost of goods sold for your business is) for the month - opening your doors today generally won't cost you anything (or at the very least, carries much less risk of costing you than a Forex trade would), and can bring you more profits. On the other hand, every time you open you doors in Forex (ie, place a trade), that is a potential expense - a loser is an expense. If you haven't budgeted to start an advertising campaign during this month (potentially a major expense), chances are, as a smart business owner, you wouldn't just decide on a whim to call your local radio station and buy some commercials. You would plan for it, and budget it for next month/quarter/year, etc., as a planned expense. Again, placing that one trade more than is necessary is opening you up to that unplanned, potentially large expense. Of course, maybe that "one more trade" is a winner..... So, are we coming back full circle (for those that have been with this thread since the beginning) to gambling? How many successful gamblers do you know? How many horror stories about gamblers do you know? Again, it's all a matter of personal perspective. I'm hoping by sharing mine it can help others find success in this business.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Firstly, I want to thank cgrey for introducing this excellent method. I want to add is that of cgrey's implementation of the 10% profit cap(not taking into consideration the compounding of the monthly balance) is really ingenious and very discipline. In most conventional businesses you don't see profit straight from day 1 of the month because most part of beginning of every month is working to cover fixed expenses (rental, salaries, utilities,bank loan,etc) and only after all that probably it's already half a month or three weeks gone by that you begin to see profits. So, you really have to keep your shop open for the whole month ! I agree with cgrey that we can close our forex business for rest of the month once we hit the 10% even it is still beginning of the month. .......anyway this is just my opinion and personal experience. Thank you again, cgrey. Rgds Vincent

For me, no. We want a big move. No matter what happens, the worst we're going to do is lose 20-pips. But, if we can get a 70 or 80 pip move in our favor, we can make our month. Aside from this system, I love the "big red" days - they're usually the ones that trigger some activity for my real trading.

Normally the UK centric news is released at midnight or 9.30 GMT. Since this strategy is centred based on the London opening at 8.00 GMT and closing at 9.00 GMT, the news anouncements shouldn't really matter. Also the US market is closed at this particular trading time and therefore should have no effect (any news announced on the previous day would already be in the price). However, there is nothing wrong in avoiding certain days if you feel those days would be wonky - using your own technical term . It is worth testing your suggestion and I am sure others who are following this thread would be interested in the results if you decide to take this route. Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
You're thinking more in terms of a store (as in retail). Those types of businesses though don't lose money by staying open (outside of emplyee wages and utility). When you have a plan or model to limit risk after reaching goal, then that's where you get those that stop at their goal. I've always said I would continue, but I'm not dependant on income from trading.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
You are absolutely right in that forex is a different animal. Your approach is fantastic actually. My only question is this. Let's say this method was your only trading method. On the months you lose, then what? I realize this isn't your only method, but would you say to others that they should find other methods to trade?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Absolutely. I would, and I have.... And it was long enough ago that it is time for a reminder... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=20 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&amp;postcount=37 This system, for whatever reason, seems to work. It probably won't last forever, and it should absolutely not be one's only trading method. Nor, should any one system be your sole source of income. Especially one like this which has absolutely no basis in fundamentals or even technicals. Diversify - give yourself opportunities to succeed even when one of your systems fails. The key, again, is to have a plan, and have the discipline to stick to it.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Risk management is definitely a HUGE thing in forex. I would say that all (or 99.98%) of successful traders have a daily and weekly stop limit. i.e. they stop trading if they lose a certain amount. This is very important because of the psychological aspect of trading. If we are losing big then it affects how we trade. Rigid adherence to this trading stop is almost universally accepted as the only way to go in trading. Most successful traders also have a daily and weekly goal (monthly/yearly etc) Once this goal is hit there are really two ways to look at it. 1. I value time. I have hit my goal and I am now happy to walk away and use the rest of the day/week to do other things. 2. I value $$. I have hit my goal and I now have the opportunity to increase my profit. (note. of course there is also the risk of loosing that profit BUT if you are a successful trader and are supporting yourself on this, then you must have a winning system.) What I hear you saying Cgrey is that you value time. That is cool I also tend to lean that way. However since this system is automated (or should be if I can get a EA to work right grrr) it takes no time. So really the decision (with an automated system) is really do I value $$ or..... $$!! (this assumes that the system is a winner. obviously it won't win all the time but over the long haul) Risk management is built into this system so continuing to trade is done with mitigated risk and that is all we can ask for in forex. In the end it sounds like you value time over increased profits and are most comfortable with capping at 10%. That is great. I think the first rule of trading is "find what works for you". What I am presenting however is that the 10% cap is an arbitrary number that you have because that is what you are comfortable with. The cap doesn't save us from any risk. We will be risking the same money, with the same system, to the same risk whenever we trade. IF I was depending on this system for income or wanted steady income from it this is what I would do. Set 10% TP. On those months when I hit 10% I would take a set amount draw. I would then continue trading. I would then increase my chance of averaging 10% per month. i.e. If I hit 10% on Jan 10th I now have the rest of Jan and Feb to get to 10% again. If I am dragging this discussion off topic please let me know. I have really enjoyed this thread. Even more than the system I have learned from the discussions on MM. vullkem116

--- 帖子 #585 ---
True, it is a matter of comfort, and each individual will find what works. Here's why, from my perspective, I see it as saving us from riisk... In back-testing, I've seen as many as 5 trades in a row that hit stop loss (at 2.5% each, that's 12.5%). I've seen, some months, 10 or 11 losers in a row (some just not losing the full 20 pips).... So, let's say, for fun, there are 6 trading days left in the month.... I'm sitting at +10%. I close the month, my gross profit for the month, before expenses, is 10%. If instead, I leave the month open, and the next three trades all hit SL, I'm now at +2.5% up. Then a winner for 3% (+5.5%), and the last two both hit SL. I now end the month at +0.5%. Still a winner, which is great. But maybe my budget tells me my minimum % to cover expenses is 4%. So, my overall "business" suffers a loss this month, where had I quit at 10%, I'd have met expenses and had an overall net gain of 6%. On the first of the next month, the net difference is I'm starting again from 0 with a new 10% target (after having covered all my expenses and banked 6% net profit), as opposed to starting with a balance 0.5% higher than it was a month ago (and not been able to cover my expenses). Not stopping the previous month, I'm only 0.5% closer to my 10% target, but the month that just closed ended very differently. Of course, this is all "what if". Firstly, this is not the only system I'm generating income from, but it is exactly the concept that governs my "quit at a target" philosophy across all my trading. Second, would this be the exact outcome of the final six trades of the month? Of course not, but it could be, or any combination of things that could result in the same ending. Sure, it could go the other way, and you'd close out much higher than 10% if 4 of those last six trades were winners. But, my approach guaranteed I couldn't lose anything, thus I preserved my capital and not only minimized, but ELIMINATED the risk that I'd end up with less than my target. If I kept trading, whether or not the odds are the system is profitable, there is no guarantee it would have ended higher than +10%. So, these are the reasons why my personal preference is to stop at goal. Yes, the extra time with the family is great, but it is just as much about having a preference for $$... I didn't intentionally gloss over this - just missed it the first time around. This is a solid alternative, and accomplishes what we're after. Preserving your capital by taking out what you need. Gets us much closer to "apples to apples" between the two approaches.... Absolutely not. The money management, in the case of this system, is THE most important part (really, it should be the most important part of any system, but that's a soapbox for another day ). The discussion over whether to quit or go on is entirely relevant.

Cgrey, have you looked at any other ways of determining the trade at 8 GMT? Now, we only base it on the high/low of 0 GMT, and I think that's one of the things that make this system so good, the simplicity. However, many days the trade goes the other way. Have you looked into any other way of determining the trade's path? Like previous trend or something similar. Archie

--- 帖子 #587 ---
No. I've said from the beginning, this system will have it's share of losers. In the end, it's worked out to be profitable. For those that need to see a higher % of winners despite the end results, this isn't a system for them.

Have a great weekend everyone.

You too, 2+2. I've got family visiting, so I probably won't have much time to dig too deep, but I spotted another pattern the other day that I need to put some MM around.... Maybe another thread if I can find some time to apply some math magic and see how it works out....

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Very Interesting week for me, had already made my 10% for the month, but decided to carry on anyway to see if the dreaded greed in me would bite me in the bum and decimate my account, but so far up about 18.5% for the month on opening balance and not looking too bad. I think if I hit 20% for month will call it a day, but here"s the thing that I find really interesting, I must have spent many, many dollars on systems, stategeys, holy grails, cant loose robots and god knows what and I finally begin to make a few pennies on something as simple as this, makes you wonder sometimes dosn"t it. Maybe cgrey should have sold us this super, cant loose, you will be amazed , hurry before we sell out system, and all for $97 with instant downloaded and 24/7 dedicated support team. Have a good weekend everyone. Geoff

It's another of my many rules of success in this business - the simpler the better. People outsmart themselves thinking something has to be complex to be successful - hence the "systems" all over the place here with 10 different indicators, and a new EA every day with today's latest and greatest "improvement". This system isn't (and will never be) my main earner. At most, it may someday represent about 2-3% of my income and pay for a few dinners out each month or a weekend away now and then. But, even in what I call my "real" trading - you'll never see an "indicator" in my charts, other than some support/resistance lines and trend lines that I use to target specific entry and exit points. This is not rocket science, yet so many people fail at it. I "cut the cord" from having charts that looked like Christmas trees a while ago - and it was from that point that I actually started realizing success in this business. So, yes, hurry and send me $97. I should probably make it clear I'm joking before we get moved to the commercial forum.....

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Geoff, fantastic show. I think your decision to continue trading and go for 20% is correct on the basis that you risk 5% per trade instead of 2.5% as cgrey devised. I admire your courage - fortune favours the brave I guess . I am not so brave as you and only risk 1.5% per trade. I don't trade every day either which means I have some more to go before I can reach my target. However, thanks to cgrey I have been able study the London opening (I manually trade) more closely and profit from it. In the past I always stayed clear of the open but I do not fear it anymore (still nervous though when I am in a trade!). Hopefully, we will all have interesting journeys with this strategy before reaching our intended destinations.

happy weekend for you brother,, weekend with green pips,

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi all, good to see there is still lots of good stuff still on this thread. As you know I've departed a little from the system, (see my other posts for details if you are interested) But I have done a little bit of playing with this years figures on the standard system ( OandA prices) and found that a 3% risk per trade has been working better and given less drawdown. It's only a little increase in risk but seems to have made a difference. Second thing I have noticed is the 9pip gap doesn't appear to have helped us out this year. And finally I found what seems to be a good way to see if price is taking off our way, and that's to enter at 8.00:30 eg 8am + 30 seconds. (I use an EA so don't watch the chart) the thinking being that if price is going hard against us at the open we get a little more breathing space without extending our stoploss. Account growth from Jan 1st 2011 @3% risk. 9pip gap 5% no gap 14.7% + 30sec entry 33% (eg made target each month so far) Take these for what they are - only 2 and a half months data, but still interesting! dave.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Dave, Thank you for sharing your research findings with us. I came to the same conclusions about the 9 pip rule last week too. However, I am still using the rule and will make a decision probably after some more live testing. Since the rule actually prevents me from trading and thus safeguarding my limited capital resources, I am not going to rush into removing the rule. I also understand your point about increased risk per trade. Geoff has already proved that running a higher risk brings higher rewards. But my preference is to risk less (my live testing is done using 1.5% per trade) but find ways of reducing the number of stop losses. I am working on some variations to achieve that. Hopefully I'll crack it soon. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hi Rasi, I have tried lots of ways of reducing risk, but you have to remember if we follow this system we are accepting a fixed % of our account at 20pips. Reducing risk directly just proportionally cuts profits. eg if we trade at 2.5% and and aim for 10% or trade at 1.25% and aim for 5% we are still risking 'the same' because the market still needs to move 80pips for us to make target for the month . However if we enter for example at 5% risk, still aiming for 10% month then the market will only need to move 40pips for us to make target. If I understand rightly this is what Geoff has done. Just so it's clear this isn't what I am doing or advising anyone to do I'm just pointing out the difference in thinking. As I mentioned 3% risk for 10% gain seems to put us (this year) in the sweetspot for how far the market can move in the first hour. Having said all that I've gone completely the other way in managing risk! I have fixed my DD for the month at 10% - so no more trades get opened after that, historically some months could have seen you well over 20% down if we had continued trading - 10% seems a good compromise. all the best. dave.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Had family around this weekend, so I haven't been around to post much. I mentioned last week I was looking at another possibility. I don't really have it in me today to start a new thread and open up a whole lot of discussion, so I'm going to share what I'm working with so far, which is far from complete , with the followers of this thread. I'm still running the numbers manually, and I absolutely would not suggest anyone go out and try this live. I'm not going to go in to a lot of detail here, so you will have to do a little work on your own to figure it out from the info below. There are two pairs I'm looking at, and they're basically standard "breakout" types of trades. Typically, breakouts have mixed success (the forums here are full of them, most have failed after looking good for for a period of time), so it will once again take some creative money management to make them work. Here's what I'm playing with: USDCHF 05:00GMT candle (H1 charts). Go long when price goes above the high of the 04:00GMT candle by at least 2 pips. Go short when price goes below the low of the 04:00 candle by 2 pips. Stop loss is the other side of the 04:00GMT candle. I'm targeting 1% risk so far, but still working it out. Close when the trade hits SL (-1%) or with the close of the first hourly candle that has the trade in profit. Example: if the trade triggers at 05:15, and when the 05:00 candle closes the trade is in profit (whatever the profit), close it. If, at the close of the 5:00 candle, the trade is not in profit (but has not hit SL), leave it open. Then, if it is in profit at the close of the 06:00 candle, close it at that point. Repeat until a candle closes with the trade in profit. EURJPY 08:00GMT candle (H1 charts). Exactly the same as the USDCHF above, except you're looking for the "breakout" of the 07:00GMT candle for this pair. *** EDIT: Sorry, forgot.... For both of these, only enter the trade during the "target" candle. If price does not break the previous candle hi/lo, there is no trade. So, if USDCHF has not entered by 06:00, no trade. Same for EURJPY by 09:00 I've not yet come up with a monthly target, but I am relatively sure like the GBPUSD system, there will need to be one (for me, at least) to make this work. One thought I've had was to trade both of these (since they're essentially the same - just different pairs) on the same account, with the monthly target covering both pairs I have visually looked back about 2-years for these. I've only done some actual calculations for the first two months of this year, and both have been successful. That means absolutley nothing other than it warrants more attention going back further. Again, these are nothing more than standard breakouts. The difference between them and most others that I've seen here on FF is that I am not setting a specific TP. I am taking what I get, and setting a TP (target) for the overall month instead of any individual trade. Wanted to share what I'm working on, and maybe inspire someone to take it further. I will continue to, but haven't had a lot of time lately.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Afternoon Cgrey, Thanks for heads up on possible other pairs to trade will take a look and see if I can work something out, will probably try the eur/jpy at 8am as this fits in with me very well. Will have a play on demo with this one for a while and see if I can work out some risk and mm thats I can live with. Kind Regards Geoff

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hey Geoff... Good luck. I hope to have more time to dig deeper fairly soon. But knowing some folks have taken the GBPUSD concept we started talking about and worked with it, I at least wanted to get these out there. Maybe they'll work out as well, maybe they won't... But at least it's a starting point.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi Cgrey Interesting thing on doing some eyeballing of eur/jpy for march so far, in line with your ideas, I decided just to do a check on this pair using exact same criteria we use on gbp/usd trade. 11 Trades 3 loss for total -30pips 8 wins for total +150pips total positive pips so far in march so far 120. Interesting dont you think? Wish someone could invent some software stuff to backtest this on different pairs. Could be we would find some gems! Geoff

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Interesting indeed.... I may need to spend some time running back a few years. I wonder if the reverse is true and that GU would perform well under these "rules" (breakout of the 07:00 candle and close when in profit at an hourly close).... I'm going to light up a new demo with these two pairs and these rules to see how it goes for a while. Leaving GU alone for now, but may just also put it in with these two and come up with some MM to treat all three with a single monthly profit target. May be interesting to see what happens spreading the risk across three pairs.... I should have some extra time over the next few weeks. I just closed my books for March (real trading, not the GU system)...

--- 帖子 #602 ---
That is what is make me so excited about this thread! Brilliant business mindset - just brilliant cgery. I will look at coding the pairs you have mentioned, I can test other pairs over long timeframes with my compounding EA if anyone wants to give me specifics. dave.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I don't know but testing has shown this system to be much more profitable if only long trades are taken and no shorts.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Please share your testing data with us. How much more profitable? How far back have you tested - this week, this month, this year, more? I'm asking because I've not found this to be the case at all over 4-years of backtesting to the beginning of 2007. So I'm curious how you came up with this.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
A trending Cable is not a friend of this system Demo account at low point for month: -10.93% Target pips: 189 (as I now have a reduced lot size) We need a few good wins before the month ends. Here's hoping

--- 帖子 #606 ---
That depends on which side of the trend you are on. Is it unrealistic to have a 5% candle in a month? Can anyone who did backtesting say what the average largest candle is in a month? -10% looks like the month won't hit +10% target, but gain is still possible. You never know.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Another 2.5% loss today - thats my limit for the month, so stopping now. Hopefully next month will be better. I need a new coin

--- 帖子 #608 ---
no trade for me due to small gap. this month is in big DD so far, lets see how we end up....

How can I set my charts with 50 EMA/ 35 SMA Lines? Can any one help me.

Please delete your post which is totally irrelevant to this thread and post it in a more appropriate thread.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
LOL. Why did he/she pick this thread (of all that exist) to ask how to place ma's on a chart?? LOL Anyway, I don't know how anyone here feels about this month and the future of this method, but one month isn't enough to discourage me (which isn't finished yet so it could finish well). I'm not trading this, but if I were. If this method was profitable 10+ months last year, I would feel good about next month or the next several months. Sure it would have been nice to get up early, but reaching profitability in the long run is what matters. Believe in money management.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Don't know. But now that he can't post anything else in this thread, at least it wont happen again. We were all new once, and we all make mistakes... I try to be tolerant and ask politely, but when that is ignored, to my ignore list they go Yeah, there were a few rough months over the past several years. And there will be more. I'm not backing out. Though I will be combining this system with the USD/CHF and EUR/JPY patterns I posted last week.. Since I posted them, USD/CHF hasn't had a loser and by itself has already returned over 5% (when risking 1% per trade). EUR/JPY has been about even. Next month, I'll be putting those two in the same account as this one, and treating them as a group. 1% risk per trade for each, 10% monthly target. So there has been some evolution since this thread started ....

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I like your spirit cgrey and I guess that is one of the reasons you are a successful trader. I have been testing some ideas as I like this method and hell bent on making it work for me. As I mentioned in my previous posts, I trade manually (not smart enough to create an EA). I think the losses this month are due to exceptional circumstances: 1. Situation in Japan following the Tsunami 2. War in Libya / Unrest in the Middle East 3. Summer Time change differentials In addition to your rules, I also added some more rules which have been beneficial to ME. For example, I do not trade this strategy on Wednesdays (historically proved to be a bad day and recent testing confirms this too!). Also I have changed the entry time to 8.05 GMT and increased the SL to 28 pips. I only risk 1.5% per trade and my target is 6% per month. My trade earlier today (24 March 2011 ) was as follows: Ticket : 9830764 Market Name : X GBP/USD Rolling Daily Stake :4 Action : Sell Price : 1.62259 Market Expiry : 5/11/2014 21:00:00 Trade Executed : 24/3/2011 08:25:24 The above trade has closed/part closed the following positions: This position was closed : Trade No : 9830507 Market Name : X GBP/USD Rolling Daily Created : 24/3/2011 08:07:24 Amount : 4 Action : Buy Price : 1.62195 P/L : 25.60 (GBP) Total Profit/Loss : 25.60 (GBP) I know it is only a small profit (6.4 pips) and nothing to boast about. However, if I had followed the original rules it would have been a total loss of 20 pips. I will continue to fine tune my manual trading and hopefully be in a position to provide some further insights soon. There is no doubting that there is a daily surge/breakout/pullback around the London opening time and we need to find a way to consistently profit from this phenomenon. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Making it your own and making it work for you - excellent. Keep at it and success will follow.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
The only modification that has crossed my mind after seeing everyone struggling this month is to not set a stop loss and manually close out at -20 pips. Only problem with this is a server disconnect with your broker will leave your trade susceptible to greater loss. It is also susceptible to greater loss if price moves very quick. Obviously for those that use an EA because they cannot attend at that hour this will be impossible. Similar to cgrey, this will never be my main trading method so I would continue to use a set stop loss and hope that over the long stretch it is profittable and supplements income from trading. This is just a thought. Just throwing it out there to see what anyone thinks and give us something to talk about. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Get around this by sending a stop loss of 25 or 30 pips with the trade to protect against server disconnect, but manually close at -20. If you disconnect, yeah, you could end up with a larger loss, but it won't be catastrophic.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
cgrey, I know you are in same time zone as me, have you adjusted the candle you are trading when daylight savings began? Before it was compare 0 GMT open price with 8 GMT open price. Are you still doing same? Or have you adjusted the GMT times also and are now comparing 23 GMT open with 7 GMT open? If I remember correctly, I think you said you backtested the same throughout the whole year. Probably not a big difference either, but Just curious.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Nevermind this question. I was mainly asking to see if I could pick up on certain patterns in the preceding candles that could maybe act like a filter for some trades. On second thought, this would be overcomplicating things and perhaps invalidate backtesting. We already know the pattern of comparing the overall price difference has worked, so checking for patterns in between might be a moot point.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
its answered already, GMT is GMT and cgrey mentioned he doesnt change the time for day light. btw, london daylight has not begun. if at all we should sdo we should do this for london not US

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I never stop looking for patterns... It's what got me on the USD/CHF and EUR/JPY discoveries. USD/CHF has had 5 straight winners since I posted about it. I get bored when a month ends early for me, and that's when I start looking for stuff like this. If you're still looking for an answer, it's no... I am still looking at 08:00GMT compared to 00:00GMT. Daylight time in London doesn't change until this weekend, so yes, for the past 3 weeks since we rolled our clocks forward, the trading time has been 4am locally (as opposed to 3am), but that's still the same 08:00GMT. As of Monday, it will be back to 3am locally, when London time makes the spring forward. I'll still be trading 08:00GMT, though - that is always constant. It helps when your broker is on GMT - this way you never have to think

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Ok, thanks.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
What I love about this method is how quickly it recovers with one good trade. +56 pips win today, which brought the account back from its low of -14.36% to -8.36%. Another couple of those before the month ends next week, could make this a positive month after all.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
The point to bear in mind that Japan does not have day light savings. The Tokyo's trading sessions are from 09:00am (+9 hrs GMT) to 11:00am and from 12:30pm to 3:00pm. Therefore: During normal times 0:00 GMT (London local time) means 9:00 a.m in Tokyo (market open time) Our rules mean we compare Tokyo open to London open (8:00 GMT) During day light saving times 0:00 GMT+1 (London local time) means 8.00 a.m in Tokyo. If we just keep to the rule, we are not going to compare like with like and miss the effect of Tokyo opening. Maybe we should consider using the 1:00 (London local time) candle to trade. What others think? As for today, nice result even though I left some money on the table using my modified rules. I hope we get many more trades like this .

Hi Guys Just a summary of my trades as at end of third week in march. As you will know from my previous posts I trade the 8am gmt candle as per. cgrey, but I use a small real money account which after febs. trades stood at $1109. 5% risk on daily balance, 20pip stop. do not use gap filter. Trades. 1 -20 2+18 3+03 4+44 So at this point had reached my +10% of starting balance for the month Cooda stopped at this point Shooda stopped at this point Wooda stopped at this point ...... but greeed said hello what if? 5+41 6+5 Over 20% of starting balance at this point Cooda...... Shooda.... Wooda..... 7-8 8-20 9+20 10+29 11+6 12-20 13-20 14-20 15-6 16-20 17-6 At this point was back to about $1163 for the month but still nowhere near any drawdown from starting months balance. 18+13 19+57 So back up to about +24% or so on start balance , all in all I would say this is so far, a very good month for this method. Four trading days left in the month Cooda... Shooda..... Wooda...... Have a good weekend all, regards to cgrey for finding this. Geoff

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Meant to mention in my last post, we start british summer time here in uk as of midnight sat. So on monday london will have been open for an hour by the time 8amgmt candle starts . Ishall however stick to original 8am gmt candle rules in my live account which cgrey backtested for us. I wiil open demo and trade this on market open to see at end of april how this stacks up against original and let you all know. Geoff

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Great stuff, Geoff. Congrats on a solid month. I'm still down a good bit, but with four trading days to go, I'm hoping we get back to B/E for the month, at least. We'll see....

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi Cgrey Just one small drawdown on very first day so good month up till now, dont seem to be having same results as you though on USD/CHF trades, maybe its different brokers or something but mine are not as good as yours. Have a good weekend Geoff

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Not sure if you're trading the USD/CHF by the same rules as GBP/USD.... They're different (see here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=597 ) So far: 3/14 - +0.6% 3/17 - +0.3% 3/18 - +0.9% 3/22 - +1.6% 3/23 - +2.4% 3/24 - +0.1% 3/25 - +0.3% 1% risk per trade.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Trading with new rules just like you , maybe my broker is a few pips different to yours. Geoff

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Alright! Everyone's come back for a little get together. I can't help but picture everyone hanging around with group tee-shirts under a banner like cgrey once joked about. Hahaha. Wondering why both you guys (Geoffrey and cgrey) are having such different results on both strategies (GU &amp; USD/CHF)? You may be trading off different candles. I know GMT is same everywhere, but maybe different broker? Anyway, have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Where's this thing at with one trade left for the month?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Tough month. I'm down 19%. Three trades (all winners) were filtered out by the 9-pip rule, so those not using that are in a little better shape. I've been updating post 1 ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...23&amp;postcount=1 ) daily, and will continue to do so for those playing along at home.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
yes its a tough month. lots of stops hit and there was one big 72 pips profit last week, other wise it could have been more worse i started demo on UC, EJ also

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Tough month indeed. -14.12% down for me, ignoring the 9 pip rule. Yesterday's trade (30th) was interesting because since the change last weekend to BST in the UK, I have been comparing the 8am (UK) candle to the midnight (UK) candle. If the comparison candle had stayed at midnight GMT (ie 11pm UK), yesterday would have been a win instead of a loss. Have others using this system adjusted their trading hours? I can see the sense in changing the 8am candle to coincide with the London open, but I'm not about changing the comparison midnight candle? I would love to add the UC and UJ systems to this next month, but unless there is an EA to place the trades automatically, I won't be able to Anyone know of an EA which I can use to straddle the relevant candles? Cheers

Hi erwal, it nice to see you using the spreadsheet I created!. I fully agree that March was not a good month for this strategy per se. However, I achieved much better results trading this manually and by amending some of the rules along the way. The hours++ spent trading this live this month (and part of last month) helped me modify some of the rules for trade. I am willing to share here my amended rules and the results for March based on those rules if cgrey allows me to do so. As you can appreciate, it is cgrey's thread and I do not want to hijack it with my thoughts. It is possible cgrey himself may have already come up with some amendments to his rules. I'm sure we can make good returns with this strategy with some modifications. Here is for a better April 2011 for everyone. Joel

Please do share you thoughts - I'm sure others appreciate modifications that have worked for you.

Yes a very strange month, having been +23% at one point finished up just +7% for month after todays trade. However this is still a pretty good return so am fairly happy bunny. Lets hope April is much better. Geoff

Thanks cgrey and erwal. As I said before I have been trading this strategy live since late February on a manual basis. I was initially interested in this strategy due to the time of trade. I live in UK and this allows me to place the trade before I go to work (regrettably I am still part of the corporate world and trading is a part time activity for additional income). Like everyone else, I was following the rules as set out by Cgrey to begin with. For trading/research/analysis I was using 1 hr, 15 mins and 5 mins candles. When the results didn’t go my way as planned, I started studying the charts more intensely. I also started collecting further data on the currency pair and started testing each variable. Following these experimentations, I have come up with the following general/additional rules: 1. Risk per trade is 1.5% of the available capital (reason: reduce the risk) 2. Target return for the month is 7% instead of 10% (reason: reduction in risk per trade by 40%) 3. Pip rule (1): The minimum difference between the 0:00 GMT and 8:00 GMT candles’ open prices should be 7 (reason: reduce the number of missed trades due to this rule) 4. Pip rule (2): The maximum difference between the candles should be 30 (reason: when the differences were larger normal market behaviour seems to change and the break-out seems to be smaller or non-existent). There seem to be a strong case for not to change the direction of the trade if the pip difference is greater than 30, i-e adapt a trend following strategy but I am still testing that. 5. Entry time is 8:05 GMT (or GMT +1 during daylight saving times) but decision is still based on the 0:00 &amp; 8:00 GMT openings. The reason is that the volatility seems to be very high at the London market opening and we were hitting the SL or getting closer to the SL regularly. There were a number of trades that closed at 8.11 GMT . The solution is either to increase the SL or enter the trade a little later. I decided on a hybrid solution and opted for entry at 8:05 GMT and SL of 28 (excluding spread). 6. Stop Loss of 28 instead of 20. (reason: there were some trades in February where we were 1 or 2 pip short with the SL of 20 before the trade went in the direction we chose and also to reduce the whipsaw effect). As you can see from the attached spreadsheets, using the rules above would give us a return of: 1. 8.80% using all the rules 2. 6.42% using all rules except (4) above i-e the maximum 30 pip rule Overall, I have managed to reduce the risks and increase the returns. Both options suggest that it is better stop trading after achieving the target. Needless to say, it is only one month’s trading results and all could change next month. However, I hope the above has given something for people to think about and come up with even better solutions. Let us discuss it for a prosperous tomorrow . Kind regards, Joel

Thank you Joel for your suggestions and for sharing your experiences. I will give my opinion and my thoughts on your suggestions. I'm not inclined to change the risk or target, however this is a personal choice. In my opinion, if I were stopping at a target, I think 10% a month is reasonable and backtesting illustrates that it is achievable more often than not. If backtesting shows it's very possible then why stop short? Now that is my opinion if I were to stop at target. However, as I've stated before, I would not stop trading for the month at target. My target would simply be my recalculation point. I would not wait until start of month to recalculate and resume trading. This is also a personal preference. As for what target is best to recalculate? Who knows? I would probably stick with 10% again because it's a nice round number. As for the 7 pip rule as opposed to 9 pip rule. I think this is splitting hairs. I'm starting to believe that this filter is negligible and everchanging. Therefore unreliable. Personally, I wouldn't use it. I do think the 30 pip max difference rule may have some merit (to not trade instead of in choosing direction). This is something that should be investigated on through backtest to see if it is a worthy filter. Markets do go through cycles of building 'energy', breaking out and then settling back into a 'flat' stage of building momentum again. So again, it could have merit based on this market tendency. Lastly, if the start time of 8 tends to have wild swings in both directions then maybe it's best to delay entry a few minutes. However, I'm not convinced this is better. I would hate to enter at 8:05 and lose out on 'X' pips because it went in my favor right from the 8 start. I suppose this is also a prefernce though; although it could have merit too if there is whipsawing at 8 which could take your stop out often. I suppose we can study this going forward. Good luck in April all!

Looking at post 1 March was a nearly a 20% loser - so stopping at -12% for me was a good idea. Basically what i do is have a stop limit of 12% max. But keep trading for the whole month until I either hit -12% or come to the end of the month - then I reset and start again. Time will tell I am sure. This is just a coin tossing method mind you - its the MM thats the important bit GL

--- 帖子 #643 ---
That was a quick 20 pip loss Great start.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Morning Puntalara Not too sure how you get loss already as its not 8am gmt yet. Geoff

--- 帖子 #645 ---
short triggered and in 33 pips profit now

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hang on - London opens at 8.00am in the UK we are now in BST so you guys are trading a hour after London opens then. Now that makes no sense, as before you were trading ON London opening

--- 帖子 #647 ---
doesnt matter where you are, GMT is GMT through out the world. pl read the original post again, we dont apply any day light savings to the system. its always 0GMT, 8GMT

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I thought this method was on London opening. So it is not then. Also we have UK news at 9.30am on a lot of days. So in the UK winter you miss all this news BUT in the summer you hit it. I must of totally misread the first post then - sorry.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi 2+2=4ex, thank you for your comments. As I said from the outset, I changed the rules and added some to suit my own requirements. Capital preservation is paramount to me and hence my reasons for looking for ways to reduce the risks which also meant lowering my returns. My preference is to make +5% and +5% in two months than to make -20% and +30%. The capital employed by me in this system was earning 2% per annum in the bank so my monthly target is more than adequate for me. As for the minimum pip rule, I know there are arguments for both options. The extensive back testing revealed that it is worth having but the recent history suggests otherwise. Instead of losing it altogether, I have decided to lower it which again reflects my cautious nature. The worst thing that can happen to me is that I will prevent myself from taking a profitable trade by having this rule, which is fine with me. However, I will continue to monitor the market and amend the rule accordingly if I see the evidence to change it. As for the start time, my changed entry time has produced better results in March. I am not sure whether it will continue. Your comments reflect your gut feel but my training is analytical and so I tend to take decisions based on empirical evidence. I really want to stress to everyone that what I did with the rules are to suit my own needs. It produced better results than the standard rules (+8% v – 19%) last month but please do not take this as better going forward. What happened in March was history and there is no guarantee that it will happen again (one cannot drive a car looking at the rear view mirror alone!). I only wanted to share my thoughts because there was much despondency in this thread after a string of losses. I simply wanted to bring some optimism and give us a chance to learn together.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Thanks for taking the time to explain your modifications to this method, Joel. I will take some time to study them over the weekend and do a little visual backtesting of my own. Just to clarify, though - I gather you DO change your trading candle to accommodate British Summer Time (although keep the indicator candles at GMT)? There seems to be some confusion emerging now as to whether we should be trading 8am GMT or 8am GMT+1. I am one of those who traded at GMT+1, and lost 2.5% this morning. Those who stuck to GMT had a win. I can see the advantage of hitting the UK 'news' candle; it is generally large, but it's a complete lottery as to which way it will take off.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
To clarify, as the first post says - GMT. All of the backtesting I've done has always used GMT, never changed for daylight time anywhere. Again, feel free to experiment, but I've been clear (or so I thought) that I've always compared 08:00 to 00:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Cgrey, I think some of the confusion regarding the time is created by your post #134 above. If you now say that the trade should open 1 hr after the London open during daylight saving times, it calls into question your back testing. The same goes for others who have done the back testing. I understand GMT is the same but London market does not change its opening times and operates according to local time. Both time frames are very important to the London market. 8:00 a.m. is the London open and 9.:30 a.m. is the important news release time. All through winter, we have been looking at the London open times and now we are looking at the second 1 hr candle after the market open (local times). The reversals you observed happen around the London open. I would appreciate if you could look into your back testing data and confirm what you did please. I hope you have not been comparing apples and oranges. Have a good week end.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I will repeat this for the last time here. EVERY trade I opened in every back test (4 years worth) was opened at 08:00GMT, and compared against 00:00GMT. I have never said otherwise. In fact, I've said, in several different posts, that I do not adjust for daylight savings time, and always use(d) GMT.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Okay now that that's been settled... let's make a million dollars! haha Have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
So Cgrey Are you sure its 8am gmt? Sorry, couldnt resist. Have a good weekend, month got off to a flying start today. Geoff

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Geoff, the above was part of a reply by cgrey in post #134 in this thread. Please go and take a look at it. He clearly mentioned London open and reversal patterns (which is known for some considerable time by the market participants). Personally there is no harm done (lost 4.2 pips today) but I need to halt trading until I do the backtesting myself to verify. In the meantime, I'll stay on the sidelines and see how this works out for others. Also, the new times (9 - 10 a.m. local time) are not suitable for me due to my work. Ho.. hum.. Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Joel - One thing I've been saying all along, is that this concept is something people should take and work with to make something that works for them. There was a discussion very early on in this thread about adjusting for DST. Some folks said they thought it would make sense to try it. Maybe it will work out better that way. All I've said, is that I didn't test it like that. When I stumbled upon this, I wasn't looking at what happens around "London open" and how we can exploit it. I was looking at a pattern I found on my charts, which happened to very often occur at 08:00GMT, regardless of whether it was standard or daylight time. So, that was how I presented it. When the discussion first started, London open did occur at 08:00GMT - hence the comment at that time that it made sense we were seeing this, because it was around the London open. In the end, I believe more than anything else, it is the money management approach that makes this work. Someone mentioned earlier this is a "coin flip" strategy... It's a little less random than that because we are picking a time that a move tends to come, and trying to capitalize on it, but the "when" in this case is much less important than the "how" when it comes to making this successful. Either way - sorry if it wasn't clear enough, and yes, I think you should certainly explore the possibility of adjusting by an hour now that the time has changed if you believe it will be more profitable for you in the end.

Traded GMT today, and hit SL -5% for April (one loss due to trading GMT+1).

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Which broker? Both of my demos (IBFX and MB Trading) and my live account all had small wins today.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
same here. 1 pip gain. never in big dd today

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Aargh! Quite right. It should have been a small win (again). Adjusted the time the wrong direction That's a rubbish start to the month on my demo account. Oh well - tomorrow's another day

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Got a late start to this month - I was away for the weekend. I've had the original G/U system running in a couple of separate demos, so I've got accurate results for it in post #1. I've also set up a demo for the combined three systems traded as a collection. 1% risk per trade per day (max 3% risk per day). Progress can be tracked in a trade explorer I set up (just view my profile to see it). First trade(s) will be taken Tuesday 5-April. This demo exactly mirrors the live account that was set up for this collection of systems - same broker, same rules, different balance.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi cgrey, Thanks for sharing your results in the trade explorer. I have started the month again, and trying to trade your 3 systems concurrently in pursuit of the monthly 10% target. May I ask whether you are aiming for 3.3% growth per system in your money management? So the original system would be SL=20, and initial target=67, risking 1%? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
No, In this particular demo, I'm treating all of these as one big collection. If I hit 10% by having 8% in one 1.5% in another and 0.5% in the third, that's fine with me - 10% is 10% The only modifications to the original G/U strategy are that the risk is lowered to 1% (still the same 20-pip stop), and TP is always 5% (1:5 risk:reward). The G/U trade will still close at 09:00GMT if it hasn't hit TP or SL.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Sounds like a good set up. I like spreading the risk a bit, even for a side project. One side effect that I like about these little side projects/strategies (other than killing time) is it keeps you up to date on what's going on with other currencies from the direct results. I may have mentioned this before in here, but I sometimes enter nano sized trades on a testing/tracking sub account just to track what other pairs are doing.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
cgrey, i am demoing USDCHF, EURJPY as per your settings, here are my thoughts so far 1. USDCHF range is always too small, around 5-10 pips and even in this narrow range most of times we dont get signals in 1 hour. if u get signal, then it can easily hit SL as the range is small. spread constitutes a major portion of the PL. 2. EURJPY has good range. but lot of times its hitting SL. Since we are closing the trade in profit (first bar that gives u profit), most of times, the profit is small compared to SL. If you hit SL 4 times, then you will probably need 12 profits to come to BE. I am not able to understand wheres the edge considering the risk reward.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Yeah, these two, I didn't go as far back as with G/U when I found them. I have no idea how they'll work out. Each of them did show some big moves during the hours we're looking at them. USD/CHF is up to something like 12 consecutive wins in my demo, 0.1% was the smallest and 2.4% the largest. But, yes, time will tell on these. Lumping them together with the original G/U is, as 2+2 said previously, spreading the risk a little, and giving us a few more opportunities to hit one of the bigger hours on a couple more pairs. I'll see what the balance looks like at the end of the month and decide whether it's worth going forward from there...

--- 帖子 #668 ---
today GU gave 72 pips profit EJ gave 9 pips UC stopped out.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Different brokers continue to be factor. I stopped out on GU (by 0.1 pips ), +16 on EJ and no entry on UC.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hello Cgrey Thanks for detailing your system (GU) - I am been demo trading it for a while &amp; yesterday was stopped out 23pips less than my stop as price gapped through. I assume when you backtested this system that gapping could not be tested. Given your forex experience do you think that gapping through our stops will be a problem with this system or this this a very rare occurence. Thanks for detailing your systems for us to use. Bidgy

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Gaps in GU should not be a common thing. I know it's a demo account, but what broker are you using? What time did you get stopped out?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
If you get gaps between 08:00 and 09:00GMT, it's a platform and/or data issue. Generally, any broker's demo platform will be less reliable than their live platform (less important to them, and they will often use the demo environment for testing), but if gaps other than Sunday nights become a regular issue in a live platform, you would probably want to start looking for a different broker. The only time you would expect to see gaps are at the market open after the weekend (Sunday afternoon/evening or overnight depending on what time zone you're in). All of that said, there can occasionally be news during the 08:00GMT hour. While not a gap, there can be wide variances in whether or not your orders (open or close) get filled (or slipped) during these volatile times. But that's not just this system, that's a function of the market in general and the quality of your broker.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Thanks Cgrey &amp; 2+2 for your replies- I have been trialing doing FX trading on a CFD platform. I will change this &amp; start to look for a FX Platform - the data may be more reliable. Cheers Bidgy

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hello. Hope all of you are well. Just stopping by to say hello.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
cgrey, thanks for continuing to update the results. I see today's hasn't been updated yet, but maybe you just haven't gotten around to it.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hey 2+2... I've been unable to connect to the VPS that runs this demo and one of my others. Today was a winner, I just don't have the exact number until I can look at the account history. Hopefully, my VPS provider will have that box up soon. Also been more focused on my "real" trading the past few days. You can usually tell if I've closed my books for the month yet based on how active I am on the forum

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Ugh... Just checked my trade explorer in my profile. The 3-pair demo is on that same VPS, and I see there were no trades reported by it today. I suspect that box has been down since last night, and probably didn't take the G/U trade either. I know there was a G/U trade in my live account today, so I'll need to do the math to determine what the result in the demo would have been based on the # of pips gained in live. I'll try to get it updated later tonight.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Cool, thanks cgrey.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
today i got 22 pips profit, i was in 60 pips profit at one point

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Finally got it updated. The VPS is another story... I'll have to plug in results based on the live account results, and the 3-pair demo in the trade explorer will also not be updating. I've not had a whole lot of luck keeping demos going the past few months (though this time, it's not the broker or the platform's fault)... I'll try to get something new set up for May....

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Wow! Today's 110+ pip GU candle really helped this strategy today. Positive at last for April

--- 帖子 #478 ---
These are the ones we wait for.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
we are on the right side of the news today. 110 pips in 1 hr

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Just under 1% profit (0.85%) for the month of April.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
As previously posted, I adjusted the time and continued trading with UK local times. i-e GMT+1 following DST change. For April the results were 18 trades, 11 wins and net profit of 91 pips. Since I only risk 1.5% of capital per trade, this equates to a profit of 4.86%. If I had opted for 2.5% risk per trade the return would have been 8.13%. The most satisfying aspect was that the maximum drawdown of only 4 pips, which happened on the first day of trading. In addition, I have learned a great deal about the London opening session. Since it is working for me (it has worked in March 2011 too), I will continue to trade this strategy going forward. Please note that this is not a trading advice and anyone who wants to trade this strategy should do their own research. See attached the results. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Alright, way to go! 3 months without hitting target... could May be the one that gets it back on track??!

--- 帖子 #483 ---
2 stops and one no-show so far in this month

--- 帖子 #484 ---
92 pip move in our direction, finally closed with 56 pips profit

--- 帖子 #485 ---
May has been a terrible month, down like 25% with original settings. is it a concidence that we have day light saving in london in this month ? somebody is trading after applying DLS. how is that going?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
lol. we already met the june target, we had a 80 pip profit today

--- 帖子 #487 ---
another big move today, 62 pips profit

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I liked the ideas around this trading method so I started to forward testing it. I have been applying day light saving always taking entry at London opening UK local time. My results is: 2010 dec Target hit +10% 2011 jan Target hit +10% mars Loss -9% april Target hit +10% may Loss -0.1% june Loss -17.8% It looked suprising in the beginning but with june and 15 trades reaching the stop loss on 20 pip almost all previous profit got erased. Could day light saving have something to do with it? However not comfortable at all to have loss streaks like in june. Hopefully it is a one time disaster but thinking about adapting a rule to stop trading for the month if I get a loss streak with 5 losses in row or so.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
i am following original rules. got 80 pip profit on july 1st and again another 70 pip profit today.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Yes I see that the orginal rules would have saved june and july. However it doesn't make any sense for me to trade the london open candle in the winter and trade the news candle in the summer (10:30 am london). Maybe try to trade both candles and also the US news candle (14:30).
