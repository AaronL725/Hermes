Hi all, thanks for all the support and the EA is completed for public FULL testing. It is rather easy by using the EA but not tested on other PAIR yet. once thanks and the support from FF member. This will be the final version and that is. Happy pipping.. trading Manual http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=240 trading template http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=241 trading EA V104r2 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=241

Hello Siobi, I am very impressed with your work. It appears the zip file did not contain the file called Heiken_Ashi_Smoothed.ex4 as when I load the expert advisor onto the chart it is calling for it in the expert log. Would you be kind enough to post that indicator? Also, does it matter what broker we use? I am just wondering if the ea will know what hours to trade since brokers times are different from each other? Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #3 ---
it didnt work siobi i change magic number to each pair and that is messags so what can i do

--- 帖子 #4 ---
hi thanks for the appreciation. the siobi.zip should not have the Heiken_Ashi I have only template: siobi_strategy expert:FX_1M_bounce.mq4 expert indicator:4 TF HAS Bar, Stoch RSI Are u downlaoding the correct one?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
hi check your indicator again, from your experts message, it shows that the error is from the 4TF HAS indicator. I have only template: siobi_strategy expert:FX_1M_bounce.mq4 expert indicator:4 TF HAS Bar, Stoch RSI please recheck

--- 帖子 #6 ---
total open trade 12 total win = 12 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hello Siobi, Can you repost the correct zip file because the ea in the zipfile that you posted in the first post calls for the Heiken_Ashi indicator. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi all Using 4TF HAS, will also need to have this lil indicator in expert/indicator folder. ~profi~

--- 帖子 #9 ---
You write that your system is "profitable". What kind of testing have you done? How many test trades? What years were tested? Thank you

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Siobi: Thanks for the very exciting EA and great work. Please post the EA without the zip file. Best wishes, Glenn in Montana

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Siobi, Great work you have done here. I´m also experiencing some problems with the ea. I´m getting errors about "4 TF HAS Bar" indicator. could you please take a look at this? Despict this problem the ea is opening trades normally. You might want to incorporate a spread filter and a time filter. Just some ideas. Keep the good work

--- 帖子 #12 ---
hi siobi can u upload mq4 file of expert it may be the problem for me bec expert file u ziped is ex4 and will try regards spider

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I can't get the ea to work?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I had to delete has ind and place it in seperate window and no more errors. Must have something to do with the overlay of the ind's. Not sure if it is working yet as it has not taken a trade. But ea may be programmed to trade during certain times only.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
hi, I had re-upload.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
thanks for the information

--- 帖子 #17 ---
the result posted is based on my DEMO account. not backtest result...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hi this EA is to trade on 1M only as per the title.... 1M bounce system...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I cannot get EA to work. Please can you describe the rules such that some of us can trade it manually? Thanks

--- 帖子 #20 ---
SIOBI Are you actually located in Japan? I am, in Kanagawa prefecture. I like the trading times in Japan with the AU, JPY, GBP overlap. 頑張りましょ。。。でも、猿も木から落ちる時がある。

BUY condition: -&gt;Storch RSI &lt;=1 -&gt;Closing Price &lt; opening price -&gt;Closing price &lt; BOL lower band (period 18, deviation 2) -&gt;HAS for 5M showing green. SELL condition: -&gt;Storch RSI &gt;=99 -&gt;Closing Price &gt; opening price -&gt;Closing price &gt; BOL upper band (period 18, deviation 2) -&gt;HAS for 5M showing RED. SL: 20 pip TS: 5 pip TP: 50 pip Currency pair : EUR/USD Best Trading Time: Japan market time zone. Reason: This bouncing system is something different from Prime FX, this system works in flat/non trending market. Asian Market showing less trend on EUr/USD pair thus it works the best.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
another trade taken today sell at 1.3986, TP 1.3083.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
siobi, where is the EA? I can't find it anymore. Can you repost it. thanks

--- 帖子 #24 ---

Hi, what is a TS if I may ask.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
trailing stop = TS

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Dear friend Could you please attache the EA file, cuz i can't see it in your post?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
siobi said he is working on it to fix something. It will probably be down until recoded and corrected.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
hi, thanks for the posting, I'm sure the EA is running and the error shouldnt give any problem to the EA. EA still open trades fine and showing profitable result until now. anyway, I had take out the EA for user to download and fixing it. So, I posted the manual trading system up to let u guys know how it works... thanks for the support and happy piping..

--- 帖子 #33 ---
thanks for you post siobi, i begin to test your ea on the london session and it's promising. I will post later the result on your ea in a short time. Thank a lot. Fredifly.

--- 帖子 #34 ---

--- 帖子 #35 ---

hi there, pleaes refer to post #32.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
hi all.... go and download... before you vote for the system, make sure u understand it... I'm curious why those people vote for NG while I'm still making profit?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello Siobi, Many thanks for the update but the ea is calling for two indicators which are not in the 1st post. Would you be kind enough to upload the WoodiePivots_DK.ex4 and the 4 TF HAS Bar.ex4 indicators to the 1st post? Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #40 ---
opps uploaded wrong EA.....

--- 帖子 #41 ---
bug fix at indicator 4T HAS. now it had been renamed to "siobi_has" Good luck and happy pipping... later stage I'll combine FX Prime V106 with thie FX_1M_Bouncing hm.... still think of the name.....

--- 帖子 #42 ---
hi ,soibi great work i only hope that you took those of us using 5 digit broker like fxpro into its programming, cus i have been runing it for a while now yet it has not open a single trade.once again thanks and i will be anxiously waiting for the combine one you will be working on to be release. NB in your own opinion which would you say works best in the fxprime.the v1 or v2 thanks once again and happy xmas :

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi there, thanks for the contribution as well. to answer you V1 or V2 better... based on below's finding... V1 entry position is always great but not the exit strategy... V2 entry somehow slower and the return always take longer time thus require higher SL and TS. For a scalper like me, I prefer V2 for auto trading I prefer V1 for half manual trading (EA to enter trade, exit by manual) so, I'm thinking to combine V2 with my 1M bouncing system. for those who r in 5 digit platform... I'll allow u guys to put the SL and TP all by your own to cater your 5digit platform issue. merry Xmas everyone and happy pipping!!!!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
thanks 4 the reply . my first question is based on 1m bounce . becos since i install it has not made any trade

--- 帖子 #45 ---
hi there, not sure because I still havent check my daily trade yet... will post it tonight... hope to have some trade today....

cant really get you, mayber can u post ur screen up?

It may be an overload of indicators, ea's and open charts for that specific comp. MT4 is hard on comp resources, at least on my computers, so I would see if it works alone in one chart to troubleshoot first. Then you may have to run more than one instance of a fresh MT4 install to get all pairs working smoothly. Post #14 may also help. I'm new to all this so I'm no expert. Just trying to free up siobi to come up with more functional works of art! Thank you kind siobi, and every one else here!!! It's amazing to me how willing some people are to share! Happy Holidays everyone!

hi there, what is your setting for HAS? I'm using 2,2,6,2 and using the HAS in the #1 post call siobi HAS. I put it into 1M chart.. sumimasen, watashi wa nihonjin arimasen.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
So MaMetod2 should be 6 instead of the default 3 ? Also are you using IBFX or another dealer? I did a backtest in IBFX and results were very poor, but I was using the default 2,2, 3 ,2 in siobi HAS, and of course we all know that backtesting is near worthless many times. Today I had a positive IBFX demo trade shortly after I opened the ea/template. It was an e/u 1.4002 sell for +6 pips taken at 16:09 12/24/08 and I was using the default 2,2,3,2 in siobi HAS. While I loved watching the simple and effective logic of your masterpiece as it was doing it's thing, I'm wondering what triggered that last buy trade at 17:58 for +18 pips? I could have used that one, especially since my chart looks identical to the one you posted in all other respects. My immediate thought is that you may be close to merging this ranging ea with the trending ea you are working on, since I notice it says v102. That would indeed be great news! One ea taking both ranging and trending trades and knowing the difference. Can everyone here spell trillionaire ? Hopefully that backtest was the garbage - inverse of true results - I think it was!!! I hope!!!!!!!!! LOL Thank you for your excellent work!!! Oh and at the very least you will need to let us know where to send you donations/% of our soon to be large live accounts!

シオビー様は日本人では無いですが、日本に滞在しておりますか？ Ok, I now know you are not Japanese but are you living in Japan? I ask this simply as if you are, then I won't need to change any time settings to use this system.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
My siobi_has ind is also all red no matter how far back I go in history. This only happened when I changed the MaMetod2 to 6 from the default setting of 3. Any ideas?

I see.. So, you are only 1 hour behind Japan time..Now, I understand. Merry Xmas Not that it is anything like Xmas here in Japan, especially as we are having raw fish for Xmas dinner. I love it..

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Siobi: I see you posted the EA again. Thanks! Question: You say that the best time to use the EA is during the Asian session. I have two different clocks that are giving me different times for when the Asian session begins and ends. Can you tell me the exact time you turn you EA on and off each day in GMT? Also, have the experimented with using the system during the other more active sessions. If so, what did you see? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Siobi, Are these the same? Also where can I download it/them ? thanks herty

--- 帖子 #61 ---
siobi san isn't japanese 1°) siobi isnt japanese namae 2°) because he would have written = いいえ 日本人 では ありません ; hi siobi thanks for your great help &amp; for this system you share with us kinonen (oh , i'm not japanese , french )

--- 帖子 #62 ---
answer 1: Japan market start at 8am ~ 4pm. depands on your location, perhaps can you tell me where r u from? For malaysia, I tunr on at 9am until 5pm. answer 2: yes, on other time, works well for EUR/USD 1M PS: new EA V102 is for all time zone except NEWS time... Regards, Siobi

--- 帖子 #71 ---
thanks KINO!!!!!!!! I used the same strategy in the EA!!! but to be more save, I added Storch RSI to ensure overbought and oversold... then also to ensure the trend is in the correct way, I added siobiHAS.... aftter that , I integrated with PrimeFX, thats the whole story!!!!!! hahahahahaha

--- 帖子 #72 ---
20081225 perfect trade... PS: my trade start on 2pm Malaysia time....due to some urgent thing to do.... couldnt get whole day result...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I have your EA loaded on my system and it took the same trade. The funny thing is at mine entered at 1.4055 and exited at .4052. From your post I see that your system entered at 1.4055 and exited at 1.4048. Any reason for the difference or is it just the broker? regards

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I think is the broker because scalping is heavily depands on which broker u r using... anyway... making profit right?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
here you are, if you want to see all the loaded indicator.... download this template... PS: the template in the post#1 only loads the EA..

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Oh yes. Profit was there. But we are using the same broker I think. IBFX? I guess it was them. My trade was live... Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You will probably always notice a difference between the results in a live and demo account -- and usually not in your favor. Bucketshops are running the show until after the holidays are over so anything can happen -- watch out.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
hello is there any boby that has test it with a 5 digit platform like fxpro

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hi there, always open DEMO and live for testing purpose.... I had my live acct BURN.....because of what you mentioned... scalping is always danger thus EA save scalpers for the best ebtry and exit price... that is the reason, I set TP at 50 pip which will never achieve!!! in my EA, my Trailing Stop 5 pip will run the show...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
ah sorry dude... no time for that, maybe later version.....

--- 帖子 #84 ---
http://www.mibbit.com/chat/ channel: #1MBounce

--- 帖子 #85 ---
do you think you can tweak a bit so that we can change sp and tp by our selve .i think that will solve our problem of 5 digit pls am down on my knees

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Not exactly good priceaction this time of year I'm sure, thus probably the results shown below. If EA can only "know" not to trade when spreads are too wide. I think that's what did it in this go-round. Highlited trade is the one talked about above, and the trade in the window - one of three stop loss trades - is one of the problem trades. I think the other two bad ones were because of wide spreads. ...I think. Let's keep this thing going! I think it has GREAT potential!!!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Siobi, Will the EA see an MQ4 version of HA Smoothed candles? Thanks for the EA, my friend.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
hi dan, thanks for the valuable information, can you explain in detail how to define the wide spread? I tot it should be standard thru out the currency pair?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
the siobi HAS is depands on HA Smoothed value, it should return the same result....

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hello i tried attaching the EA to 1M chart, after installing it into expert/indicator folder, but the response i got was "is not an executable file, it needs to be recompile" pls what am i supposed to do? SIOBI..more greese to your elbow!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hey Umar, Put FX1M Bouncing V102.EX4 into the experts folder, It is not an indicator. Make sure you have put all of the indicators in the experts/indicators folder and put SIOBI STRATEGY.TPL into the first templates folder (not the one under experts). Load the Ero/Usd 1MIN chart. Open the SIOBI STRATEGY Template. Then grab the FX1 Bounce Expert advisor and drag it to the chart. Good Trading, TomZ

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hello siobi. I think I speak for everyone when I say thank you for your excellent work. That day I noticed that the spread was all over the place - sometimes 5 pips or even more probably due to low holiday volume and thus erratic price action. I'm certainly no expert and everything I have learned is from here and other such valuable forums recently. I can only contribute by posting my demo results and giving my fairly uninformed opinion, so much more capable people such as yourself and others here can take it to the next level. I must say that I am glad to be alive in a time where people from all over the world can get together and cooperate to this degree. Seems like nothing is impossible under these conditions! Today I am on another computer, so I can't post the remainder of that trade day, but I believe there was another 1 or 2 other stop loss trades that day making it a bad day to trade this strategy, and probably ANY strategy. Thank you, and talk to you all soon.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
hi Dan, ot was really a bad day... I had cross check last week dataand found that the spread is more than 2 pip! hm... the V103 I'll include the spread feature.. if Ask-Bid &gt; spread... then no trade.... EUR/USD = 2pip.. depanding on platform....

--- 帖子 #94 ---
hi all, I'm looking forward for valuable feedback as to make this trading system better.. untill today, I had only one valuable feedback from Dan.... 1) Spread flexibility to avoid to trade.... the spread are indeed killing...... Please help to contribute some idea or maybe shall I close this thread because it is not a good trading system perhaps....

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Siobi, Thank you for being so kind as to share your hard work. I just found your thread on Saturday, and have your template set up to test tonite. Will be glad to share results. I'll be trading mini lots on IBFX with a small live acct. I also have read most of the fxprime, and fx-50 scalping threads from where some of these ideas are from. What a great idea, to develop an EA that trades rangeing and trending markets! Again, looking forward to contributing however I can. Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
"Please help to contribute some idea or maybe shall I close this thread because it is not a good trading system perhaps...." No way!!! LOL I think this is based on VERY solid foundation, and can only get better as it moves forward my friend. I'm certain it will build momentum and will be one to watch in no time, so please if at all possible, let's all go forward! Below are two more trades we must find way to avoid. Perhaps if trade going against us in such fashion, close trade early without waiting for 20 pip stop, somehow. Again I'm no expert, but surely I can post charts. LOL

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Siobi, As I said in previous post, I have not had a chance to test this system yet, but very much looking forward to it. I manually trade / scalp on 1 minute charts now with only ema's and kinonen's 2 cci indicator. I use cross of 5 and 13 ema because their fibboncii #s instead of 6 and 12. My cci settings are 55 for main trend and 21 for entry, again because their fibboncii #s. I stay out when ema's bunched up together and kinonen's indicator changing colors constantly. As I'm reviewing rules, just wondering, have you tested your system with a little larger trailing stop? 5 pips seem very tight and possibley limiting potential profit. Maybe at least add the spread so you have 7 or 8 pip trailing stop. Looking forward to your comments. Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #98 ---
You've got to be kidding me, IBFX is showing a 15 to 20 pip spread on EURUSD. Stay away!!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
It's still weekend spread, will get better after 8pm EST

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Siobi, First 3 trades losers, sell at 1.4107, sell at 1.4111, and sell at 1.4126. Maybe add as additional filter on bounce sell, fx prime indicator must not be green, and on bounce buy fx prime indicator must not be red. This would have prevented the 3 losing trades, what do you think? Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #101 ---
We prevent these and we're all set:

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Only one thing, have you seen the spread on the eur/usd with some brokers? It will only get worse as time goes on as well. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Here is attachment

--- 帖子 #104 ---
The spread seems to be normal today. GL/GT.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Kinonen's 2 cci v5, also may make good filter. settings 55 cci and 21 cci

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Siobi, Seems to me that it is a little early for that. The time of year does not really make for a good test. We really need to wait until the new year when traders are back at their desks and the markets start to move again. regards

--- 帖子 #107 ---
IBFX spread on EUR/USD is back to its normal 2 pips.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Where is the EA? I don't see any attachment named as EA.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
FX_1M_Bouncing_V102.ex4 from first post, rest goes into indicators, and template in .....template

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thanks for pointing me to the EA. Thought this was just another indicator and not an EA.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
No problem! While waiting for some decent price action on e/u, playing with stochrsi, and find it quite "interesting", no? Could almost trade it alone on most of the 20, 80 turnarounds in this ranging market. If it wasn't for the crazy spreads earlier. Thanks to siobi, kino and everyone else here for their generousity!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
good idea, but system will not know whether it follow the initial trend, the best 'm thinking is to create the BE (break even) and Trailing Stop of 5 pip to capture the profit... the selling chart u posted is FX Prime rules and the exit can be cater when the trend of Heiken Ashi change color. (in V103) the buying chart u posted is Bouncing rules and the exit still cant be determine but BE can ensure losing of the trade.... (in V103)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
hi Sir Viver, thanks for the input, I think boucing system can be always intercept with fxprime rules.... if bouncing showing SELL and the 5M HAS showing sell as well, FXPrime will not show green...(concept wise... but FXprime show GREEN!!!) the only problem happend here is when bouncing system showing SELL, the 5M HAS is RED, system take the trade... but next minutes/bar, it turn into BLUE.... and the FXprime start to show green..... hm.. maybe that is the time we determine the exit of bouncing system? Not sure yet... need further testing... and additional filter to cater if the FXPrime showing other trend while we entering the trade.... good idea...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
spread control will be in V103

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Sounds good to me my friend! LOL I'm just here playing around untill I gain the courage to step back into the market after having lost approx $2200 some months ago. Had I not hedged that sucker, it would be much bigger loss, and at least I didn't blow my whole account. (My first hedge trade!) That was one fun ride!!! LOL From good peeps like yourself, have learned much since then, but I'll let you and others more adept at this to do the thinking after putting my very small and amateurish ideas forward.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
hi there, where is the Green line? but from your chart, we can confirm the exit of the bouncing should be control by the HAS turn into other color...

--- 帖子 #117 ---
1) spread control 2) bouncing entering ensure not against fxprime 3) FX Prime rules exit can be cater when the trend of Heiken Ashi change color. 4) Bouncing rules exit still can be cater when the trend of Heiken Ashi change color + BE to ensure no losing....or...mnimum lose....

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Siobi, Yes, that should make big improvement. EA just entered buy trend trade at 1.4155 let's see where she goes! Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Trailing stop, locked in profit of 3 pips. stopped out at 1.1458

--- 帖子 #120 ---
hey soibi great work man and thanks for the EA.i think forex is worth trading becouse of people like you around.once again thanks. and soibi hope you will remember to make adjustment for those of us that uses 5 digit brokers in the new EA v103

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi, The Bounce EA entered a trade at 5.22am and exited at break even I guess based on the trailing stop. Trading the FX prime manually would have entered about the same time and price but would have resulted in a +27 trade based on my own trailing. So it seems to me that the trailing stop criteria in the EA is a little too tight. Tried to add an image but could not figure out how to do it. regards

--- 帖子 #122 ---
hi guys, my first trade +2 pip

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Siobi, Yes this is the trade that I got into which exited at break even. Like I said, it seems to me that there should be a way to vary the trailing stops. We could have stayed in the trade much longer for a better return. regards

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Looks like the trade was entered a little before yours on my brokers platform, and ended up 20 pip loss Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #125 ---
hi Naresh, it is a buy signal from FXPrime indicator... if we do manual trade, we might be lose the trade.... from your post, it seems u r taking it as bouce signal...

--- 帖子 #126 ---
hi there, when is your trade entered? I do not have the signal!!!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yes the EA entered the trade. It was not a manual entry. I was just making the point that the exit was too soon or so it seemed to me. If I had been trading it manually I would have stayed in longer for a better return. If we could make the trailing stop wider maybe... Naresh

--- 帖子 #128 ---
hi Naresh, just to clerify... on 5:22... it should be FXPrime signal... not bouncing signal.... correct me if I'm looking at the wrong signal...

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Pls, the new version settings, is it an EA or just the rules to follow? if it is an EA, where can i find it? thanks

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Sorry Siobi I am not sure what you mean. The signal and trade was done by the bouncing EA that you posted. Just entered again. BTW at 9.30 and then again at 9.32 so I have 2 positions both in positive. Lets see how they do

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Both exited. One at +9 and the other at +10

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi guys, second trade....profited 12 pip...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
hi there, sorry for missunderstanding... the system trading method will be always updated at post#1. above is EA newsetting...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
hi siobi first thank you . these are the trades taken today by your EA . i have mentioned that the trailing stop do not work , some of the negatives trades were above + 12 pip and end up on loss . as for the last 2 trades i close it manually waiting for your comments regards

--- 帖子 #135 ---
hi there, this EA will trade for 2 system, FXPrime and bouncing system....

--- 帖子 #136 ---
hi there, this might be a big problem if the TS do not work... For my platform, it works fine and you may notice all my trades were exited from modified SL.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Siobi as you can see the third trade was a short at 14259 and the price went down to be in profit and after a retrace it closed -20 pip . it means the SL do not work !! what do you suggest me to do , maybe there is a bug, how can we fix this ? i have another problem when i put the ea on IBFX it gives me only red lines for HAS . thanks

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hi there, I dont think it is a bug asit works fine for me and others, perhaps you may check the "Expert" and "Journal" tab to give me more information on your problem there. I had no idea what happend to you but for sure the TS not works on ur pc... anyway, you may always turn into manual trade based on the EA, we are here to evaluate the system NOT the EA... thanks and hope you may get it thru.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hey Samer, Was your trade at least 5 pips in profit to trigger the ts? The initial sl is set at 20 pips i believe.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
My trades today so far are -20, -20, 13, 14, 11,10

--- 帖子 #141 ---
hi i've attached all the indicators, but no trade has been executed yet. is there any problem. thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi yes sure the 3rd trade it was in profit more than 12 pip and when it has retraced , it didnt trigger the TRAILING stop and went to close -20 pip . u can see it from the chart i posted . regards

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Umar, the little face in the upper right corner of your screen has to be smiling : ) Try reloading the ea and make sure the " allow live trading" box is checked when it pops up.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Siobi, I had 2 more trades on IBFX platform. The 1st a bounce trade at 1.4252 for a 21 pip loss at 8:08 GMT, and the 2nd a trend trade at 1.4254 for a 14 pip gain at 9:05 GMT Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Stoploss and trailing stop may not trigger as intended if spread too wide. One of reasons for repeated 20 pip sl triggered in past few days of crazy priceaction, but an adjustable trailing stop etc. would prob. be helpful as has been stated earlier. There are a few other issues that siobi has said he will address in v103, but with the market returning to normal a bit, the following trades look better!!

Hi all, Here are the first couple of trades executed by the EA. Both longs... The first I understand and I managed the stop manually for +9 I cannot understand why the second long triggered. Any ideas? Naresh

Perhaps my file was too large? Please advise Naresh

Anybody know how to get the rsi stoch and the siobi has multi in the same window ? Thanks in advance .......Tom

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Tom, open rsi stoch, then drag the mtf on top of the rsi stoch. It will open in the same window.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ill do it .Cheers !

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I don't know how it's doing for most of you and Sobi I respect your diligence but this EA is simply not being profitable. I'm still looking forward to your V103 and the corrections though. My statement for today is posted at this website, all trades were made with the EA on a Demo account with MetaTrader-ForexMeta. The link is http://tinyurl.com/89fj67

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Maybe it is the current condition of the market but the EA is making bad calls all the time on USD/JPY. I let it make ten trades over a full day in the Asian session. It lost every single trade. This is not surprising as an EA can really only work in the market it was designed in and can not work over both a ranging and trending market.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Great night for Bouncing EA, 7 wins 0 losses all hitting a profitable stop loss so far at 111 total pips for 11 hours of trading. Looking forward to testing for a full week after the holidays. Statement posted at http://tinyurl.com/9n7dko There is only one manual trade I did on the 31st at 05:42 that profited $12 and the rest of the statement is performed by the bouncing EA.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
guys.. .bad day!!!! u guys may start download it and switch the exit rules to False

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Market conditions play a big role in how a particular ea will behave .I bought the has robot ea and it was makeing $ on pull backs .When the market continued on a uptrend not pulling back much , it cleaned out my account .It was his hedging ea . Since, he is selling a couple different robots .I only lost 250.00 enough to learn my lesson . Im trading your system manually for now ,Thanks for everything happy new year friends !

--- 帖子 #160 ---
To all my Forex Factory friends: Just wanted to wish you a Happy New Year. A sincere thanks goes out to all my friends here at FF for all the knowledge and assistance you have provided to me over this last year. Wishing you a happy -- and profitable -- new year 2009.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Does anyone have a good Saddle EA which closes one pending order when the other goes active?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Cleartrade, I think you probably mean a straddle EA, When you straddle a ranging market with 2 orders, 1 above and below, waiting to see which one breaks. Search this forum with key words "straddle EA" at search site at the top of page, and you will find several. Enjoy, Sir Viver

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Siobi, Just wanted to thank you for sharing your version 3 of bouncing ball EA. Even though spreads were still high most of the Asian session yesterday, the EA managed to take 2 trend trades, and 1 bouncing ball trade, on IBFX live acct. and all three trades were winner's, see attached. Looks like this EA is much improved and can't wait to try it next week when spreads should return to more normal levels. Thank you again for your generosity and hard work! Sincerley, Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yes, thank you siobi!!! Great new year to all of us!!!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
hi there, can you post your setting? Do you turn on the ExitRules? how much spread you used? what is the trading time? Asian Market? Regards, Siobi

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Siobi, I set the spread to 3 instead of 2, and I kept the exit set to false as you suggested in your screen shot. Traded the Asian session only. Thank you again! Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Naresh. In regards to your uploaded pic. not looking like it should, try saving it as a .gif or .jpg file instead of .bmp. That might work.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Thanks Dan, I will try that. I have the EA loaded with the same settings that you appear to have. No trades taken although it looks like there should have been a couple at least. I started after you did. Not sure what the problem is on my side. regards

--- 帖子 #169 ---
V103 trade time: Tokyo time -20,-20,+4,+20,+15 =&gt; resulted... -1 pip... V104 trade time: Tokyo time +5,+3,+1,+2,+1 =? resulted .... +12 pip... new V104 5M trend filtering is based on ADX 5M as per screen attached... will continue update tml...

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Siobi When will you post the download for V104?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
hi there, V104 is having serious lose after Tokyo Market.... stil configuring and the latest will be next week...

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Naresh, I would redownload everything on post #1 and overwrite all existing files in mt4. Make sure to put the indicators, ea, and template in the correct mt4 subfolders. Let me know if you're unsure of anything concerning above. Then I would restart computer and then restart mt4 and see if that works. Given everything is in its proper place, you should see some trades in the next day or so. Thanks for your hard work and dedication siobi! Take your time and enjoy the new year!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Siobi, Thanks for the nice work. Will it be possible to edit the TP and SL levels; because Alpari has started to price funny 5 digits . In this case, corresponding SL and TP should be 200 and 600.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
hi there, this will be inV104... allows to put the SL , TP and TS all by your own...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hello siobi, Thank you very much for the EA. Your hard work is very much appreciated. It seems that all brokers will be 5 digits sooner or later.... I also have the 5 digits problem. Can you pleeeeeeease create the 103 so we can trade it with our 5 digits brokers. Thank you Best regards Pluto2

--- 帖子 #176 ---
hi there, I think my last post already mentioned, V104 will have the feature, dont worry. currently in testing for V104, trading time from Asian Market start till end. bouncing system opened 2 trades and both showing 9 and 12 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hello, Here are a couple of trades that the EA took which I cannot understand. The first one stopped out at +2 although Exit Rules is set to False... The second one was a buy entry although the trend is down... Any ideas? Naersh ps While I was typing this there were 3 short entries which are playing out as I send.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hello again, Hope you can see the entries in the last post. It seems that the trailing stops are still working even though the setting is set to false. Here are the 3 trades which I mentioned. They exited at +18 +20 +17 Hey, I am not complaining... Just trying to understand. regards Naresh

--- 帖子 #179 ---
hi there, Exit rules is for this system auto exiting the trade based on certain condition. eg: Heiken change color, trend change... in order to minimise the lose. Trailing Stop is not consider exit rules... so TS still there. anyway, V104 will have the feature for this TS,TP and SL.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
opend 5 trades.... all profit trade... first 2 are bouncing, last 3 are trending.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Okay got it. Thanks Siobi! Naresh

--- 帖子 #182 ---
hi siobi i cant find this version 104 , where is it ? thanks

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Be patient... coming soon. Thanks. Siobi. Great job. Wish you a Happy New Year 2009.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi there, V104 will be release next provided my setting shows the best result and I hope that should be the last version. V104 new feature: -&gt;using ADX 5M instead of HAS 5M to get the market trend. -&gt; bouncing entry rules is NOT related to trending rules. eg: although trending rules showing LONG, but once it hit boncing rules, it will still follow bouncing rules. -&gt;auto exit for bouncing rules once the xpMA showing different direction (thanks to Cobra system idea) -&gt;flexibility on setting -&gt;SL = 15 pip. -&gt;TP = 50 pip. -&gt;TS = 5 pip. -&gt;trading system to use =&gt; bouncing/trending, or both. -&gt;Trading Time =&gt; 0~ 6 for ibfx platform (japan market trading time) -&gt;spread =&gt; 3 pip -&gt;Lots =&gt; 0.1 -&gt;Exit rules will be always false, so i lpan to take it out...because I plan to put auto exit for bouncing system. hard coded value: -&gt;Magic number 20081041 =&gt; V104 system no 1 =&gt; bouncing system -&gt;Magic number 20081042 =&gt; V104 system no 2 =&gt; trending system -&gt;account margin

Hi siobi, I discovered this thread over the holidays and back burnered it until now, waiting for the New Year to pass. I've just read up on it...I'm very impressed! The work you have contributed is amazing. I loaded up the EA tonight at 4:30 GMT and just let it go. All solid trades and all profitable. I also left it on into the Euro session- and as expected, got slammed at the Euro opening. But the system fought back after it settled down, and it's right back where it was in profit. This is clearly a well thought out system. I look forward to participating here on the thread; and just wanted to say THANKS for your hard work and expertise! Happy New Year

--- 帖子 #186 ---
hi there, Thanks for the participation. We are looking forward to make this system better and better... thanks everyone.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hello all. I've been taking shorts when the trending part of the ea takes longs - and vice versa - adding shorts at successively higher lots every say 5 pips that it continues to go against me, at which point it usually always retraces toward my original entry price, thereby giving me excellent gains either straight away from the original position and/or the subsequent larger lot positions. My thinking is that "trends" (micro trends?) on the 1m chart are rarely long lived, and if your original oversold/overbought position was premature, it's only a matter of time after which you experience some immediate dd - during which time you add to your original entry - that price will invariably move back toward or even through that first entry. Even if on the rare occasions that price doesn't make it back to the first bounce entry, you will most often make excellent gains on the subsequent larger lot entries away from the original entry, since price oscillates on the 1m chart in a fashion making this method much more effective than on the longer timeframes. (If I remember correctly, EAs such as firebird, and other such martingale systems are made to work on the longer timeframes, which can be riskier when a trend occurs. I think trends on the 1m timeframe are not much of an issue in the bounce system.) Anyway, will continue to let the ea take it's bounce trades, and take the opposite of the trending trades - which sometimes do work out ok - and see if I come upon a "trend" that wipes my gains. Don't know how much sense that made, but at the moment I'm only taking paper trades since I will need to find a way to quickly add positions say every 5 pips away from my original entry, at subsequently larger lots. What I love about this ea/template which I'm using in a purely overbought/oversold bounce fashion is that it often gets me into an excellent bounce trade. If that entry is premature because of a "one minute trend", it seems to me that I can add one or two additonal entries and price will retrace and make profit quite quickly before continuing on its way toward the "macrotrend" direction. Playing with the yen below since good spread also:

--- 帖子 #188 ---
thanks for the reply. bouncing is my initial thought and I do getting profit while market is ranging... the bouncing will lose if it is the trending market... so that is why I always refer to 5M to confirm direction... if we purely taking those overbought/sold signal to do boucing trade, we might be in danger of those trending time which we thought is bouncing entry. history : V101, purely bouncing V102, combine bouncing and trending with HAS V103, includes spread V104 combine bouncing, trending with ADX Today will be doing a FULL Japan market testing on EUR/USD. PS: once this pair is tested I'll move on to other pair for further testing.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yes, I see what you mean siobi. Even with additional entries, if in a bad trend even on the 1m the gains in ranging market can go bye bye. All the best with the testing and thanks again!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
31 pip

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi siobi, could you please post V 104? Thank you

--- 帖子 #193 ---
hi siobi i liked your ea i tried it yesterday made 11 pips before asian session but during it i lost 100+ pips and you show profit..... here's my statement maybe i did something wrong also, look at the last 2 trades positive, if the TS was a little bit less tight i could have run them to 1.3633 as of I am writing If I may say,you should consider that option to let the user chose his own TS, some people like it tight, some others like to let the winners run please let me know

--- 帖子 #194 ---
BTW, I saw i did not have the fxprime indicator put in although it was loaded in my MT4 shouldn't it was supposed to appear?maybe it was not in your template also, do we have to close the ea manually during london and usa sessions or does the ea stop by itself? and does it work in any pair or just eurusd? thx for all your answers i think we have a good potential to make $$$$ with this ea

--- 帖子 #195 ---
hi there, I'm now running V104 and having 1 week testing... not yet release.... sorry

--- 帖子 #196 ---
yes, It might not in my template. you may attach it if you want to DO NOT use it for other session. ONLY EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
guys. final version (hopefully) only EUR/USD. turn it on for 24 hours... it will auto close during end of the day daily.... (23:00)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Siobi, Great system been following it. I tried to install the new version but there is no settings to choose from and its says "system Type =None". Also can you post a template for the system. Thanks, Amlo

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi Sioibi: Just wanted to ask. Is there supposed to be a template in the zip file? I loaded the indicators and placed the FX_1M_Bouncing_V104.ex4 file in the experts folder along with the standard MACD and Moving Avergars Sample EAs...but I do not see a tmp file. I have never used an EA before is there a link I could read about how to set it up? Moreover, if we are to adjust the various indicators for wider or lower spreads and higher or lower TS, are there instructions? I was think that either myself or Dan Johnson could help to put together a quick pdf userguide to come along with the download. Something similar to the THV system by Cobra. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi, i just ran a backtest on the 1.04 for the last 2 days, and got messages like this: 2009.01.08 12:58:132009.01.07 07:32 FX_1M_Bouncing_V104 EURUSDm,M1: OrderModify error 1 2009.01.08 12:57:422008.12.04 22:04 FX_1M_Bouncing_V104 EURUSDm,M1: System had expired siobi, can you please look into this?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I deleted all indicators out of the indicator folder first to ensure there are no conflicts. I deposited the exe file into the correct folder... I clicked navigator, then expanded Expert Advisors...doubled clicked on FX_1M_.... It is greyed out...tried to click on "Allow Live Trading" Under inputs left everything alone and this is what came up on my chart... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I thought that there should atleast be a template file... I suggested it before, and I am thinking it would be useful to have a install/userguide....nothing complicated...just a simple "How To" Anyone??? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Allright! Starting to get exciting up in here!!! Between my manual trading (one day demo anyway) and siobi's new ea, it's Christmas all over again!!! Will add the new ea now, if I can keep from admiring my manual trading! And my manual trading would be nowhere without kind siobi!!! (Even with stop outs from siobi v101 and another ea I have on this demo acc., I was still able to take in $624 in play money in only couple of hrs. total trading.) I hope - and pretty sure from siobi's magnificent work here - that the new ea will be a "killer"!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Dan, we wanna roll on the floor laughing with a big cheezy grin as well. I thought that siobi already released the new EA version 1.04. I just cannot get it to work. Was there supposed to be a template file included in the zip file? Are we supposed to be waiting for something else in the mail as well??? ???

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I would use the previous v103 template and add the new ea to that. Will do that in the next few minutes after I'm done oogling over the below statement. Will let you know if I have any luck my friend.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Are you trying to get the indicators on the chart ,Just right click on the indicator and attach to the chart .To get the smiley face from the Ea Use the toolbar at the top to see the expert advisor Icon and click on it to make it green .

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Now to figure out which of the 4 mt4 instances I should add v104! ...And that's on this computer!!!... Maybe add to another computer . ...Yea! That's the ticket....

--- 帖子 #208 ---
You are amazing. Thanks for all you do. Siobi. You are amazing. Thanks for all you do.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
LOL Winsteadglenn You are amazing. Thanks for all you say kino

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Okay...so is this what it should look like? I am completely new to EA trading...I've only traded manually before...I appreciate your assistance. If one wants to use an EA, should the chart be visible? The Green EA sign is on but the EA in the Expert Adviser is greyed out. The MACD Sample and the Simple MA sample that comes with MT4 are not greyed out... This is what my chart turned into...

--- 帖子 #211 ---
cashmeer, what I would do is download everything on post #1 and install in correct folders - seems you know exactly how to do that part. Then open mt4 with v103 template and ea showing and simply remove v103 and replace with v104 in that same template. Make sure though, that you also install the latest v104 indicators so it can use them. If you also want to see the new indicators, then drag them (xpMA, T3MA, and slope direction line) to chart. Make sure you have smiley face on v104 and you should be all set. Let me know, as I'm the worst at explaining things.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
here is what I came out with

--- 帖子 #213 ---
There is no template available for V103....the first post of the thread is the V104...am I missing something? I would like to know exactly what the EA is doing rather than let it run invisibly in the background. I am familiar with most of the indicators...but am not sure what the settings of the EA are.... anyhow, 1 step at a time...I want to make sure that the chart is setup properly... All the latest indis are in the right folder...

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Can I skype you to assit me...? I was going to send you a PM but you have that functionality turned off in your profile.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
cashmeer, see if you can attach the siobi HAS indicator to the stochrsi and the fx trend indi. separately in another window, although I don't think that matters which window it's in. More aesthetic than anything else. Remember though, I'm no expert myself.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
You know cashmeer, you may actually be ahead of me. I now don't think siobi wants the siobi HAS to be used with v104, so it seems you have your "template" just right. We will have to wait for siobi or someone else to verify, but seems you have it just right. We shall find out soon, as I'm not on Skype anymore. If indeed your "template" is spot on, which I think it is, just right click and save the template as siobiv104. Damn good thing I didn't write that pdf file huh?!!! Good work my friend!

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Dan: I'm not sure what my chart is reading....it's aaaa...anyhow...I still want to know what parameters the EA is set to use... Maybe siobi, when he/she get's a chance could elaborate... If it is a good tradeable system we should make a PDF userguide and include it in the download... Is there any reason why the MQ4 files are not included?

Is there any reason why the MQ4 files are not included? that's a good question ,that i'm asking too , if i could have mq4 , perhaps i'll will make some improves (perhaps i don't know) what Time Frame is the best one for this system ? thanks kino

The 1.04 is not opening any trades in forward test here (worked in backtest though). Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I think there is something missing for 1.04, been running for almost 12 hours and no trades opened. Hopefully we will find out soon...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I think it will only trade asian session. Less volatility I think. Been keeping myself busy trading siobi's template though. Not bad for one day, if only I can do this in a live account!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
guys, to conclude...question aer as below I'll answer later... rushing to office now...urgent) 1) Trading guide 2) Template 3) why no mq4 files what else?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
No worries Siobi...we can wait... Your subject line read "V104 Manual Trading" I do not know if you meant Manual Trading or Trading Manual :-) I think a trading manual is essential for numerous reasons. Trading manually might be explained in the rules. I think it's important for people to get a good understanding of why the program is making the trades that it does.....for people new to these indicators or new to a system like this, it may be helpful to explain the reasoning behind the logic built into the EA. Anyhow, I am sure you took this into consideration. So we will just wait for the template and some instructions. Thanks for your effort.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes, I have one.... Will you be running for UN Secretary General? If not, please do after you/we make this ea the best available! What a guy, huh?! $160 more manually using the template, waiting for v104 to place some trades: EDIT ; Two trades already taken for 10pip profit by v104!! (Before using this template, I would never be this consistent, and all in one day)

--- 帖子 #227 ---
11 pip profit with 3 completed trades and one stuck in a consolidation for quite a while. Never good when 1m trades go this long, as it begins to be luck rather than logic. We shall see where it breaks to, up or down. So far I like it very much though! As we all know indicators are lagging and this can already be seen from just the chart below - bouncing entries are a bit late to the party, but that doesn't matter if it trades often enough and usually gets a good piece of each move, and it seems to be very good with the trends. That should make up for the occasional stop losses. I will continue to trade manually, and obviously test this latest wonderful ea and post results. ...Already trading better than paid ea's! Eternal gratitude to siobi and everyone else here.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
yes, this EA doenst close this trade and it might be a losing trade... if you are trading live, then u better close the trade with minimum lose... if u r testing in DEMO... let it be......or set a SL at 10 pip.... because once it breaks... it hurts!!!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
LOL, yes siobi, thanks. I was tempted to close it at +1pip but then remembered it's demo and need to test it and not me. LOL

You should have just gotten a buy trade. If you didn't I would first make sure that you don't have another ea on your mt4 at the moment, or at the very least make sure your magic #'s are different. Right now I have two trades open one a sell from earlier and a very recent buy.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hi there, click on your expert tab and re-attach the EA to the window.. if anything fail, it show show you in the expert tab.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Siobi, today I have been playing the overbought/oversold bounces of the stochrsi, and have had exceptional - for me anyway - success. If I get in too early, I keep buying/selling into the move against me and it usually comes back for a healthy profit. When and if you ever get a chance, you may want to look into a martingale type buy/sell pattern on the 1m chart, which should be greatly more profitable and safer than the same martingale type system on a longer timeframe. The entry of the stochrsi is quite impressive to me, and on the occasions, like below when we have a runaway breakout, we keep selling on the way up and eventually it comes back to at least give us profit on the last larger lot positions. It's never fun to keep selling on the way up or vice versa, but if done by an ea I can swing it, since today I made good manual pips by doing it that way - which is a miracle for me. LOL!!!

Ok, It finally triggered. It actually opened more then one trade. Here's a screen shot.

Glad to have you onboard this 200mph Japanese express train amlo! ("The target speed for the train is 310 mph. Central Japan Railway has a maglev test train that ran 361 mph in 2003") I have a feeling siobi's forex ea will be faster! Speaking of fast vehicles, you all should check out the eliica on you tube when you have a chance. (8 wheeled Japanese electric car with over 800hp) Now for some rest after breaking the $1000 mark in one day on my demo acc. with siobi's template with this last quick trade:

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Siobi, I have tried on your V104,i notice that there isn't any stop loss on it.its only when there is a profit then the stop loss will secure the profit.I back test it,got some trades show massive losses.I thought the initial stop loss is 30pips?it did go beyond 30pips during the forward test.is it possible to set hide s/l to false if there is?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Closed bad trades a bit late, but even so not bad so far. Adjustable stop may be in the works, otherwise I'll try to use another takeprofit type ea on another chart closing all trades at certain stoploss. 30 may be way too high, we shall see though.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
hi all, attached is the Manual Trading guide + all the indicator. For those who like auto/semi auto trading, Please used this EA and you may exit the trade manually. I do not include the EA guide as EA is for entry purpose, so why bother about the EA?

template for manual trading and EA V104 revision 2, to allow u guys to see recent ADX for 5M and 1M.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thanks Siobi: I hope this was not rushed out on our account. Few comments... I understand the rule about the mosquitos but the rule about 50pip stop loss...on a 1 min chart?? Questionable Money Management is right! Anyhow, I think if we all continue to test this out we may be able to refine it such that the s/l does not have to be so far out. I would prefer to take less trades if at all possible... Having said that, I have not yet managed to setup the system entirely in order to go through it thoroughly... I will send my feedback.. Thanks, Cashmmer

--- 帖子 #243 ---
SL=50 ? haha you may always trade based on your own preference. just an advise, you may set the SL to 15 pip as usual is just like how you wanna trade on this system on the exit point. For me, I rather use 15 pip as my SL and semi auto trading, entry by EA, exit manually, so I set 50 SL is to ensure if I lose my internet connection I do not lose that much... offcourse if I'm losing on the breaking of the price, I'll stop immediately.. and it might be losing less than SL that I set previously. after a long reply, cut it short, SL50 is to secure if you use EA trading. Manual trade SL you may always feel and exit by your own. No comment on that. If you were to ask me on how much I set for my SL? my advise is always 15~20 pip for scalping. Close trade if not making money. I'm now still testing on Fully EA trade. Next week will be my testing week again..... Sorry for any inconvinient caused.... Regards, Siobi

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi Siobi I don't get it as it was yesterday, was it an ea that was supposed to close its positions itself? what is the difference for the revised ea you gave today? why the sl are 0 until we move to b/e and then the t/s appears? what is the hidden sl if any? thanks for those answers

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Ok, maybe someone more intelligent than myself can get the following take profit ea to work alongside v104 in order to have a hard automatic stoploss. For some reason, I tried inputting 0 for the magic # in the MTP ea and it wouldn't close out my manual trades. (0 should close all open trades whether manual or opened by v104 that are stopped out I think) I used 3 pip stoploss (maxloss) just to test, and once stop was reached and beyond, trades are still open for some reason. A good stoploss for v104 may be 15 as siobi suggests. Anyway...

--- 帖子 #247 ---
man...I am completely lost in terms of how to use an EA. I have never used one before. I need to read through the help files.... I just managed to get the charts up and running and I still do no know if it is right...it does not look like yours. Perhaps Siobi, when he/she is less busy can post a chart to confirm the look. Moreover, I remember a thread that siobi posted talking about letting the EA run through the day and it would automatically close at 23:00 hours. I have no idea where to find a time function nor the function to modify the TSL or the S/L... To top it off, my broker crashed their servers this afternoon and so I could not trade at all... oh well....let's see what happens next week...

The EA will close the trade based on HourEnd that you set.. revision changes as below: sl reset to 50 pip. trading hour revision to 0~8 (ibfx platform) and allows changes ... reset spread to 2 instead of 3 BE setting.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
hi there, pls refer to post #250 for those setting. as for your chart, it is correct but you still need to check your expert tab. See is there any indicator loading failed?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
You are using ATC, aren't you? The 5 decimals on the price can cause a problem for some ea's. Maybe Siobi can advise on that. The ATC demo servers were down for hours Friday. What a pain in the ass! I recently started testing out their MT4 platform to see how well it would work with Hotspot, which claims to be an ecn. If they can't get their act together any better than this on the live platform then I don't see much hope for them. Are you trading live with them now? Any problems like this in the past? Thanks, buddy.

Sent you a PM

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Siobi: I, as most people in here, are grateful that you're trying to put together something that could help us all make some money in FX, and you're not trying to sell it to us. Having said that, I think you need to manage people's expectations...I refer to your quote above. I think the impression you gave was that this was something that could be left on all day and would open and close trades as per instructions. Maybe, I don't know, but maybe that's not possible...and that is fine......I think this week ahead should be revealing in terms of what we might expect. One more thing, someone mentioned to me that there may be an issue with brokers that use 5 digits...I thought that was almost standard these days. Should I expect an issue, or will I need to modify the EA in order for it to work with a 5 digit system? Again, Siobi, thanks for all your efforts!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Below is the screenshot of the template I see when I load the siobi_strategy.tpl on the first post of the thread. I think it is possible to change the setting from 4 to 5 digits in the properties of the EA, by changing Num_Of_Digit from "false" to "true" but this has never been explained. Many people have requested a way to be able to change the SL and TS on this EA. It would be useful to be able to change them, but without having the .mq4 file from which the .ex4 are compiled it will not be possible, since they are hard-coded in it. Unless Siobi provides these, you will not be able to change those values. He has not mentioned why he has not attached the original .mq4 files in this thread, but I would suppose it is because he either does not want anyone to modify them, or is concerned about someone selling a copy of them, which does happen with good EA's sometimes. Maybe he could answer these questions if he would like to. I'm sure they will be asked over and over here in the future if this proves to be a profitable EA over time. Here is the template I have:

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Wow Jeff, you were certainly right that I do like this "Cadillac"! .........But......... I only need a "Civic" to get to my local Walmart two miles away. In other words, for the single purpose of closing any trade that is -15 pips, it may be overkill, and that would not concern me if it weren't for the fact that it may take up considerable resources, especially since it would run in addition to v104, and not act as quickly as a very simple close orders ea. There is no way to tell other than actually testing it and any other simpler close order ea with v104, so for this purpose I will reserve judgement as to how well it will perform in this specific task. It may very well be that if you just input that one parameter in the ea, there will be no delays or problems with even a plurality of open orders in drawdown and about to hit the hard stop - such was the case the other day on my IBFX demo acc. On the other hand, for manual trading it's just the ticket from a preliminary quick read of the link you provided. Thanks very much Jeff!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi fellows, I don't know if anyone has done any backtesting on this EA using the strategy tester on the MT4 platform to see if it is profitable. I don't see anything about it on the thread. From my backtesting -- as it stands right now -- the drawdowns outweigh the gains and it is unprofitable over any longer period of time. That is, when you let the EA run without interruption using the present settings. These 50 pips stops are what will get you. As some people have said before here; you can use the EA for entry then you may need to manage your trades from that point on manually. In that case, what would you suggest as a rule for your exits if you are not going to go with what is programmed in the EA? Just use "gut feeling" or what? It definitely needs to be optimized for the best TP and SL settings. Someone needs to do that first and maybe it will prove to be profitable, maybe not. Until then you are just using guesswork and the best results from your forward testing will be meaningless unless you have an exact set of rules and parameters you can go by in order to duplicate your results over time. Good luck with it, PistolDave

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I manually stopped 3 trades for a total of 53 pip profit on the 9th. Had there been a 15 pip stoploss instead of the 50, on automatic, I believe v104 would have given me 31 pips profit. Very respectable indeed for one night! The trade below that I closed at -$160 would have stopped out at -50 pips. Ouch!!! From only one night testing, plus the aforementioned backtest, there needs to be an adjustable stoploss at the very least. (Perhaps 15 -20 pip hard stop.) The rest looks quite promising indeed!!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I had mentioend to Siobi about the 50 pip S/L and he mentioned that it was set that way so that in the event that your internet connection is interuppted you lose a maximum of 50pips. In the THV system , I also use a 50pip stop loss to gaurd against spikes in the system but use a mental S/L, ususally at a point where it may break a trendline that I am following or some other level of S and R that has been broken. It rarely exceeds 20pips. Siobi also mentioned 20 pips. I undertsand what Dave is saying about not knowing where to put in a s/l or TP. If it is purely based on risk tolerance, then 15-20 pip S/L is clear, but what about the TP. I am trying to get this to work with the Vhands simulator but have not had luck yet. I cannot get it to enter a trade. Perhaps it is becuase of the 5 digit broker. I think once I can get working in the simulator the best way to exit may become evident.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
On what are you basing your exit in profit? Hitting a level of S/R? Change in the color of the candles, something about StochRSI? How are you managing your T/P?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
For my manual trading I simply buy when stochrsi is oversold and vice versa and get out at a quick profit . If it goes against my premature entry, I keep adding positions untill it comes back my way. Nothing else. Edit: A little too quick profit below, as I should have waited for the oversold signal at third red vertical line to exit, but for some reason was spooked by the 5 pip spread at the time. For the semi-automatic v104 I just closed them when I came back to the comp. and saw they were in unacceptable drawdown. (I did not touch the rest of the trades.) I've only been doing manual and semi-auto trading the siobi method for one or two days, but remember we're not trading the 1 or 4hr. charts. I have no problem with the trailing stop, take profit, and/or whatever else as it's done that part quite nicely, just the excessive 50 pip stoploss - which I would love to be adjustable thus precluding the use of another separate close orders ea. As a matter of fact, I am quite impressed although it's only been one night with v104.

hi all, thanks for all the inputs. I do really take into consideration, but this week I hope to do a full week testing without modifying any other changes as per you guys request at my NB/PC. Request are as below: 1) allow change of SL setting manually. answer: as I mentioned, this EA shouldnt been run without monitoring, we should some how close it when it is reverse of the trend. (why dont I code the exit rules in together? answer: I did, check the previous post, but resulted not very good, so I decided to manual close, SL is always 15~20 pip.) 2) 5digit answer: already done 3) mq4 answer: someone answered for me. Good luck guys... hoping this week can identify some good exit strategy.... and no more new filtering....

Whats meen with " system type = none" on my screen. 'Using Alpari with 5 digit price.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I loaded it on Alpari demo and got the same message. On the other hand, v104 that is running fine below, gives me the same message (At least during non trading hrs.) If you don't start getting trades during the Asian session, let siobi and the team know. Below are results from v104 on my laptop first (+44pips), and then v104r2 on desktop (+34pips). I think the differences are most likely due to different computers and different IBFX servers/feeds, as I'm not sure there are any functional differences between the two ea's. When siobi comes back he may shed more light on the above. In any case, very impressive so far!

Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1. i'm alomost confused about the EA v104 timing. i am using fxpro as my broker, &amp; their platform's time reference is on GMT +2. so what actually should be i the closeHour, HourStar &amp; the HourEnd that should be inputed on the EA 2. We are using 5 digits Quote, to set accurate SL, TP &amp; TS, should i set the Num_Of_digit to True or False? would be very grateful if i am scaled through.

Hello everybody. First - thanks a lot for siobi for great work and sharing with us Your strategy . I want try it manualy and have couple questions . In pdf file I find : Long Signal (Bouncing) ADX 5M showing &gt; 23 and Previous ADX 5M showing &lt; 23 - do You mean here value from ADX , applying on 5 min TF ? And if that correct , if all value must be from close bars we chose on 5 min TF bars 6:00 and 6:05 for 6:11 bar on 1 min TF ? RED candle. - do You mean Heiken Ashi Smooth candle on 1 min TF ? Storch RSI &gt;= 99 ( in post #21 I find this signal for other direction , but may be it not for bouncing signal , just want be sure ) and on Your tpl I see level for stochRSI is 10 and 90 Please confirm this information or correct me if am wrong. Thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Japan is GMT+9. your broker time zone is GMT +2. Japan market start = 0800. for you it will be 0800 - (9-2) = 0100. your start hour = 0100, to aviod market volatile, you may start at 0200. end time = 0900. for question 2, 5digit platformset the Num_Of_Digit to True. SL, TP and TL will be auto adjust in the EA.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
One question more. I know , You recomanded trade Asian session , but I run it on London for looking how it work , can You comment both trade , which it take ? I mean what is the enter ? Bounce , trend or scalping? Thanks Peter.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Yes 5M ADX means open another 5M window and put the ADX indicator there. 6:00 closed bar for 5M show strong up trend, then check 1M 6:01 until 6:05 to see is there any chance to go in for Bounce/trend/. RED candle always means price bar, unless I type wrongly... YES, is 99 for SELL and 1 for BUY. the template StorchRSI is defaulted value from the indicator itself. You may change it. For manual trading, I always set the leve to 90 and 10, and when the Storch RSI moving over the level, I will check the data window to ensure the closing got cross 99 or 1 to decide enter the trade. I hoe my explaination is clear for you.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
sorry, I'm not sure whether u trade by EA or by manual. if u trade by EA, u may always show the comment by right click the order tab and tick the comment. you shall see some commment 20081041, 20081042 or 20081043. check my previous post and you shall know it works on.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
It's trad's was taken from EA and have coments: firs one 15:26 20081041 like I found in previouse posts it must be bouncing enter and the second coment 20081043 - i think it scalping enter correct? Thanks Peter

I think You don't understood me. I ask about situation : I looking for signal and it time for example 6:11 and I have red candle on bar 6:10(open price &gt;close price) and close price &lt;iBand from 2-nd buffer (lower) for 6:10 bar and stochRSI &lt;=1 on 6:10 bar Now we must check whether on 5 min TF for ADX . On that time we have closed bars 6:00 and 6:05 and open current bar 6:10 Value ADX from 6:00 must be &lt;23 and value from 6:05 must be &gt;23 . That correct? And I want ask which value You use from ADX ? Couse we have 3 value ADX , +DI and -DI . Thanks Peter.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
if u r looking the 1M closing Bar at time 0610 so u may enter at 0611, then the ADX 5M BAR u should be looking at closing bar of 0610. Only take ADX value, not DI. if u r looking the 1M closing Bar at time 0607 so u may enter at time 0608, then the ADX 5M Bat u should be looking at the closing of 0605. I'm truely sorry to make u sooooo confuse and I'm trying my best to explain to you. Regards, Siobi

Good rezult for Asian session . I have run Your EA on my MIG platform ( GMT+1 server time ) from 0 to 8 . It make 38 trades including 6 loss -119 pips and 32 win + 235 pips , what give +116pips Good work. I want better understood system , and from that my more questions. Peter

--- 帖子 #298 ---
But the true is on 5 min TF bar which marked 0605 close at 06:10 , when start next bar, from that my question. Which bars use on 5 min TF for confirmation enter value from closed bars? Any words , Your EA use something like that for confirmation : iADX(....period_M5......,2)&lt;23&amp;&amp;iADX(....period_M5...,1)&gt;23 or iADX(....period_M5......,1)&lt;23&amp;&amp;iADX(....perio_M5....,0)&lt;23 And one question more - I din't find in pdf file how use ADX on 1 min TF , can You say couple words about ? And please confirm the ending of magic number 41 - bounce 42- trend 43 - scalp correct? Thanks Peter

Thx Peter.

Hi siobi. Can You confirm setting for Heiken Ashi Smoosed (2,2,6,2)? Cause when I apply it to chart with this setting I see nothing. I try apply it in right down window. I want make some analiz for trades making with Your EA today and opened4 charts for that : bounce , trend , scalp and 5 min with ADX , I will show rezult later. Thanks Peter

2 2 3 2 kino

--- 帖子 #304 ---
thanks kino , I get numbers from pdf file , it's need be fixing too , I think

--- 帖子 #305 ---
i 'm no sure in fact because in this systeme HAS siobi ===&gt; 2 2 3 2 but HKsmoothed it is 2632 ???? you have to check the post N°1

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Yes , default setting for HAS is 2632 , in pdf file I find 2,2,6,2 and with that setting I have nothin on chart , then ask about setting - with 2 2 3 2 it's work , but I think siobi is confirm

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I analized all trades . The rezult like I said before is good , but I'm not sure all trades make with all Yours rules siobi , but that just You can confirm , I just show what I see. First two trade was with ending magic number 43 , and I think it been scalp trade First sell 00:08 , as for me EA take trade too fast - value PSAR from previous bar , which is closed show to go long , but may be I'm wrong Second buy 00:24 the same as first but another direction

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Next 4 trades with magic number ending 42 and I think it's trend trades I think all that trades was taken from one signal , I don't know it's OK with work Your EA

--- 帖子 #309 ---
7 trade magic namber ending 43 - scalp

--- 帖子 #310 ---
8 trade with magic ending 41 - bounce trade

--- 帖子 #311 ---
My EA only run as system type: Bounce all of time V1.04r3 (Jan 13 2009 ) ??? Any problem ?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I think next trade You can recognized On my list it 12 (m n 43 - scalp) time 01:46 15 (m n 42 trend ) time 02:04 16 ( 42 ) time 2:06 I think this bouth EA take also from one signal In my case it also take 17 trade from the same signal

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I can't get what the problem You have. Do You down load good file? and put them in good folder on Your PC? because I do not have problem with runing this EA Here is last version of EA , put in folder /expert good luck EDIT and of couse You need have all indi from post 1

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Which EA file are you using ? can you upload it plus .set file, thank.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Outside trading time and your EA can trade ??? Am I right ?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I don't post all trades , but I never see any confirmation from 5min TF , ADX crossing 23 level , but may be I don't understand what You wright in pdf file ADX 5M showing &gt; 23 and Previous ADX 5M showing &lt; 23 May be You can put couple of pic with Your trades to show what are You talking about. Thanks Good luck Peter

--- 帖子 #317 ---
You can set here value Hourend 23 for ex , and EA will work from 0 to 23 , and it's time of Your brockers server time couse .

--- 帖子 #318 ---
15 pip stoploss doesn't work that well as can be seen below.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Made approx. 80 pips in one day using the siobi template, not even trying. (Simply trading the Stoch Rsi) I've done the same for the last 3 days on different accounts. Siobi, if possible please make an ea for us all using this method as it is very profitable, yet very time consuming doing it manually. Please e-mail me if interested. Thank you for jumpstarting my trading!!!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi to all, I would like to help to test this EA but i would like to have a set file for begin with something, i anyone can share the set file I will test it and the variations of the set file that you like in my server.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
And sorry , I just forget about this trades , which I don't understand yet . first one buy time 04:21 with magic 43 , means scalp and Slope Direction red and two buy orders time 07:58 and 07:59 with magic 43 and Slope Direction too red. I want say all this trade is profitable , but I'm not sure it opened with rules. Thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #322 ---
ok, wait for V105R1. allow to choose True/False for the trading system. I noticed u do not set for SL? how it works?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Hi siobi. Yes, since it's only demo, I don't use stoploss. When I will trade live, I will need to have a takeprofit ea (like the one azjeff posted) managing all my trades with a hard stoploss so as to avoid disaster. Looking forward to your next version and will e-mail you all parameters of my manual trading once we have done all we can with your current ea. I think that as we progress, I may not have to manual trade though! Even so, I'm getting better I think!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
hi Pipter, I'm totally lose track on your post. What you need actually? From my understanding, you are lokking for explaination on why the EA take those trade? lets have a live chat later during japan session... same channel...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
So far much better than last night.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Been trying out the EA for the past 2 days but I still no trades done. Read through the whole thread and followed the exact instructions but still no trades. Its my first time trying to use an EA, so are there any specifics that I might need to know to get this working ? And yes there is a smiley face at top left plus it does alert me when the price is going up or down.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Can you post a picture of your chart? And also maybe with the ea properties box opened up.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
http://img79.imageshack.us/img79/6990/platformvo2.jpg here goes, and i already checked the allow live trade box

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I think the latest version of the ea is at post 281.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
i d/l that too for the manual. didnt know the it might be different from the one siobi posted in his first post. i'll try it out thanks

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Sorry , may be I can't clear say what I need I just want understood rules of strategy , which You use , that's it . I try read posts and learn from pdf file , run EA , looking when it open trades and now I think I knew more . Now the dark thing for me still 5 min TF . What are You looking for on 5 min TF , I can't get what do You mean here :ADX 5M showing &gt; 23 and Previous ADX 5M showing &lt; 23 . I will very glad if You can explain that. Thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Bottom chart is v104r3: v104 had a better night this time around:

--- 帖子 #333 ---
still cant get the ea to work. tis must be a dumb question but, are we supposed to leave the platform on throughout using the ea so it will auto trade ? im used to pending orders and SL TP which do not need the platform to be open. so i am wondering if using ea u have to leave the com on..

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Siobi, nice system. Where can I download v105? and can you make it work with GBPUSD? Thank you

--- 帖子 #335 ---
v104r3 trades the Asian session, so that is when you would have it on to let it do its thing. Getting brave in my manual trading. Maybe too brave! Over $1900 in less than 3 days. Account blowup should happen soon. ...Hey it's only demo!!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Where is V105? In the zip on first page the EA is still named 104

--- 帖子 #337 ---
We have till 2012. That's when some say the world will end. LOL Untill then I think we should wait patiently and give siobi a chance to see what works, and what he want to release to us, and when. Of course if you have entry/exit ideas, or anything to contribute, by all means do, as I know you have greatly contributed - including at least one ea.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Just a quick thanks for the work here, the EA is working very well for me on Demo and I am looking to add a small LIve account to my completely automated portfolio. I do however have one problem! This EA crashes my MT4 at the same time every night! 12 am - I have checked everything and there is nothing else set to run around this time. The problem is it is knocking out my other trading EA running on MT4. My broker is ALPARI - any help appreciated.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Ok, thanks. Does it work well with other pairs?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I tried it in a very limited way on other low spread pairs but it only opened one other u/j trade. You may want to try it to see if it will open more. I believe siobi is focused on e/u right now which is probably the best way to do it at the moment. ...I just took a u/j manual trade and almost lost everything I made in past 3 days. Doesn't help that I entered at Michigan consumer sentiment. Lucky to have not lost anything on that one. It's all good though, as it's only demo. Speaking of which, if anyone wants to go live, I'm sure siobi agrees when I say "please use very little of your live trading account untill you know it like your wife!!!" ...or better!

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Ok, thanks Dan, good to know.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
If you are sure that your mt4 doesn't also crash with the siobi ea off the chart, I would retrace ea/indicator/template installation, then if that doesn't work, try installing a fresh mt4 and adding your two ea's. If you're using Vista, it is known to do some funny things with mt4. Google Vista and mt4 problems and see what you get. I'm not using Vista on any of my computers. Someone may have better ideas...

--- 帖子 #343 ---
hi Siobi your doiing a great job, its really appreciated can't wait for your v105, i will try to find a way to find a good exit strategy when i find a way to make it work But for v104 r4 or r2 is not taking any trades, can someone post a screenshot of what they have on the screen or tell me all the indis that must be in your expert/indicator folder, i took the most recent template and indis but it only gives me alerts and when i do strategy tester it shows EXPIRED, im using fxpro demo, any support will be appreciated im currently at work and will test it tonight thanks

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thanks Dan for the suggestion, will try tonight. I think Visat may be the problem here.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I believe post 281 has most recent ea that siobi posted. Indicators are FX 1M Bounce system.zip from first post. ...I think!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Thanks,Dan i already took that zip file, still same problem, will DL again and try it tongiht in case after work, and i dont use Vista, i use the stable XP i also made sure i have the smiley face active on the top right corner hehe !!!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
i get in the journal that system had expired, what do you think the problem is?? thanks

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I have read all the threads from posts from 1 to end, Amazing is all I can say, I have downloaded the EA and the indicators, now I cant wait for the next market session to begin so I can join the Team to test this money making machine. SIOBI - keep at it you will soon become a hero

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I have heard that before. I've had my issues too, but haven't ever checked my log for that specific problem. We will have to wait to see on Sunday night. Sunday night EST that is. Who knows what the universe will bring you?!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Yes, it seems like just yesterday I had that problem.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi Dan, i asked because of this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=334

--- 帖子 #352 ---
hi all, Truely sorry for all the late reply. I'm doing some other testing with dan and almost no time to look after this thread. V104 is still the latest version. unless there is some good exit strategy, or else V104 will still the current latest version, check the revision of V104, I think V104R5 willl be the latest one and will be upload to ff soon by tomorrow before market start. regarding alpari crash issue on closing time, I think the EA is having a closing all trade feature which closes all the trade after a specific time. regarding the high expectation of th is system, I do have to inform u guys, this EA is made for scalpers like me. we trade based on 1 Minute chart, 5M as trend. I dont like high spread, so concerntration still on EU pair. scalpers always lose to GOOD entry position, thus this EA helps to do that. exit strategy is always based on SL 15 pip unti lnow. trading time is important as below reason: EU move slow during japan market, thus less risk for scalpers. the retrace and bouncing is allowing us to make 30 pip perday hopefully. a money management is important for us as to set daily target

--- 帖子 #353 ---
hi all, new revision. reember to trade only japan market... exit still manual.... scalpers, take profit and run away is our mission!!!! daily target hit and run away is also our task.. target for 30% of your acct balance perday. for those dont like the moneymanageent, just simply turn it off.. Good luck guys!!! continue for the hunting... is time for me to go for a nap now....

--- 帖子 #354 ---
thanks siobi for new version ... can u say what do You use for filter on 5 min TF and how? thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #355 ---
do we apply the same template from before?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
my broker is EST so I set the following in configurations: Hour Start: 20 Hour End: 4 Close hour: 4 is that right? is 0.1 lot a mini lot. If I want to trade standard lots, set it 1? Let's see how it goes....getting excited !!!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Have read all the posts, but still kinda confused! Not interested in manual trading at al with this EA, so what is the latest version that is totally automated?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Im so eager to start running the system My brokeer is Alpari that should be GMT+1, do i need to make any setting adgustments? if yes pls let me know which. thnks

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hello....anybody home here? Have read all the posts and have installed supposedly the latest version on page 1 on an IBFX demo using E/U on 1m TF. However, under Inputs it says "exit at your own risk". Thought this was a completely automated EA? Is there a version that is completely automated with entry/exit? Thanks in advance for any help here!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
if you look clearly it says in the config S/L 15 pips...Trailing stop loss 4 pips... that's about as automated as they come...either stopped out with a loss or profit...

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Thanks....got it up and running....already completed one trade with 8 pip profit!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
hi there, 5 digit like alpari, you need to turn on the num_of_digit to True. regards, siobi

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Siobi, could it be that this the problem with my set up because Im using Alpari, Pls can you tell how to change it Thank you

--- 帖子 #364 ---
hi there, ya, no offense. this EA is for bouncign and trending. u may be right, when the EA place a trade but it goes other direction and it lose. We always win or lose in our life, same to this EA. we are just based on the condition to enter the trade and set a daily target of 30 pip. no matter winning by 30 pip or losing by 30 pip, you should stop trade. I never said this is the killer EA which always win and win and win. I personally stop trade after reaching 30pip. the more u stay the more the risk is. This is Forex. Nothing can be assured. get back to the trade. If you guys do have any question on the trading of this bouncing system, pls post.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
it gives you indication to go long sometimes and the market just goes directly opposite[/quote] Yes I have noticed that entries are made in the opposite direction of the trend. For instance I was entered into a long trade by the EA at 2.47. Then while I was still long in the trade there were 2 short entries triggered at 3.09 and 3.10. regards Naresh

--- 帖子 #367 ---
hi siobi thanks again for your work just im having a problem,, it doesnt seem to take any trades, just popups of UP or DOWN, i posted a screenshot to see if im missing something ?? maybe the settings in the EA is not set correctly ?? im using fxpro metatrader maybe repost your template

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thanks for your response Siobi question:This EA it is meant to triger trades by itself right? what it does in my system is pop up an alert and ask me to go up or go dow. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
hi there, sorry for my poor explaination. Recheck your lot size... 99 ? is your broker allows such big trading lot size? (I'm not sure) Do you turn on/off for the money management? if u turn on, then the lot size will re-calculated based on 0.1% of your balance. if u turn off, then it will follow the initial lot that you enter in the EA setting. the moneymanagement is for my own usage as I'm using mini acct with 100 as deposit.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
yes is normal as this EA will alert user on the current trend. you may enter the trade manually based on the signal or you may wait till the EA auto enter the trade. the alert is just an alert...

--- 帖子 #371 ---
How do we turn on the money manager pls

--- 帖子 #372 ---
it is defaulted turn on. it was always set to TRUE in the setting. you can turn it off.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
About how many minutes after the alert is it supposed to trigger automatically, any way I waited but it didnt trigger, any clue?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
hi there, I suppose you are mentioned on the arrow up and down trigger. no clue, once condition is meet, then it triggers. ask the broker ...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Since I adjusted the number of digit to true on my alpari platform, the EA has given me 3 accurate signals for over 10pips each. and thats within about 30 minutes Siobi You have My respect!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
hi there, once hit daily target, then u may exit and shake your leg then wait for tomorrow... PS: your previous comment "THIS A POTENTIAL TIME BOMB", you owe me an explaination.. Regards, siobi

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Naresh, I think the exit strategy is not yet define, so you have to do manual exit as I mentioned earlier...[/quote] Yes Siobi, I am exiting manually. But the long was still going and the trend was up. The question is why there were 2 shorts triggered in the middle of this long trade. Please see the chart I posted where you will note the 2 shorts in the strong uptrend. Wondering why this happens. Thanks and regards Naresh

--- 帖子 #378 ---
About that statement I made it before you gave me the correct settings My number of digits where set to false and I Am using a 5digit platform Alpari so I guess there was a conflict whithin the system which made it to be giving my wrong indications, Thanks to you It have been corrected now, I just picked up another 5pips Man [b][size="7"]I APOLOGISE big time

--- 帖子 #379 ---

Please see the chart I posted where you will note the 2 shorts in the strong uptrend. Wondering why this happens. Thanks and regards Naresh[/quote] hi there, I think it is fair enough if the market is in trending but while during the trend there is some room for the bounce to take some small pip. I didnt check your screen because I'm doing a FULL test on V105.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hi siobi sorry to bother you, i tried everything,it was at 0.1 lots but shows 99 on the chart ??? weird anyways heres the EA settiongs i have now, i s there any errors or something i should change ??? thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
tunr the moneymanagement to False

--- 帖子 #382 ---
thank you very much for this EA, its going to be my best freind now, hey did you notice I have delited that my former rude comment, If only I can get the EA now to be triggering itself I will be happpy because I miss some valuable pips by the time it takes me to enter the trade manually, if you can help on this too I will appreciate

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hello, can you send the mq4 file? your EA show System had expired.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
hi siobi ok now it has 0.1 lots, but if you look at this post by naresh it shows system type = bounce mine is set to None ??? also if you look on the bottom of naresh screenshot compared to mine i dont have the HAS on he bottom, HAS (heiken ashi), is there a different name for the HA ??? picture here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=365 thanks in advanced

--- 帖子 #385 ---
he is using siobi HAS. system type always showing the last trade system. is either bounce, trend or super. nothing to do it is just a comment.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
siobi still does'nt take trades alone, i extended the trading times to test it, i even installed another Metatrader with only those indicators and still doesnt work Can you re-upload all the indis and templates again, maybe something is missing. i never had a hard time like this lol !!!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
hi there, sorry to make your life thougher.... http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...d=191532&amp;d=Jan the latest indicators are all there. the latest EA is V104R5. hope to hear that you are able to get it done...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
hello... can you answer me?

--- 帖子 #389 ---
you said the latest EA is V104R5, but in the attachment is v104....????

--- 帖子 #390 ---
what to answer u?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
11 trades. 2 lose 9 win total pip lose = -30 total pip won = +26 total win in lot = 2.64. later will post V104R5 result

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Just download latest version and rename it yourself so as to not get confused with other versions. What it's called doesn't matter as much as how it does.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I don't know if you got it up and running, but for 5 digit broker input "true", not the default "false" which is for ibfx and other 4 digit brokers. Also make sure to "check mark" allow DLL imports, and "uncheck" confirm DLL function calls.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
guys, I had tune a bit on the bouncing entry and it shows good result as per screen capture. please help to do a full test today.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
4 trade 39 pips

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hello Siobi, Terrific results. Your work is very impressive. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #397 ---
something strange.... when I set the trading times in the EA for the time based on my broker (EST) I set them to 21 - 4.... Then the program says outside of trading times.... But If I leave it to default it says inside of trading time? I am in the Japan session now. It should be set to 21 - 4 if my broker is on EST, correct?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
hm.... did you set the close Trade hour to something bigger than 24?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
hi Dan, i am trying it now, quick question do i check LIVE trading ?? even tho im doiing DEMO ??? Thanks

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Siobi i will test your new version , if ever i can make it work hehe !!! i have 4 PC's and 1 laptop, will try it on other PC's in case its my PC, but i doubt it im currently on the strongest PC, but you never know.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #402 ---
SIOBI, SIOBI, SIOBI im currently testing it on 2 other PC but still not working BUT i think i know whats the problem, FXPRO has 6 DIGITS, after i put it to true 5 digits, i just relaise that i have 6 digits, then i viewed the screenshots in your thread and everyone has 4 or 5 digits but i have 6, im 99% sure thats the problem hope you can help

--- 帖子 #403 ---
hi there, Sorry abt that, perhaps you may still test in other platform which is having 4 or 5 digit. when it come to final release, only I'll do that... now still too early ...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi Siobi, I checked every thing but the ea is not taking any trades. My demo broker is alpari-us. version R4 was working fine. Any suggestion here is the screen shot of my platform. Thanks

--- 帖子 #405 ---
ok no problem, good idea to concentrated to fix this problem didnt think to demo on another broker

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I CAN'T get it to trade? The smily face is on? NO TRADES? Thanks

--- 帖子 #407 ---
hi there, check your expert/journal tab to see is there any clue. Gd luck

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi Siobi, Expert/journal both the tabs say that loaded successfully. all the indicators loaded successfully i.e slope direction line, HAS, FX Prime, xpMA, T3MA and Stoch RSI. It is still just giving alerts but no trades.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
same here, no trade... 06:22 got a buy signal... exited at 0 pip

--- 帖子 #410 ---
another buy trade open at 07:02.(ibfx) close at +1. do u guys get this entry?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi siobi. These are mine - last 3:

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Bad night even with 25 pip stoploss:

--- 帖子 #413 ---
today target already hit, 39pip during the opening of the japan market. I think it is fair enough for me today. dont over trade and there is no killer EA...

--- 帖子 #414 ---
bonten, maybe your very interesting qqi cross has a place in the siobi ea. I'm no coder, or a great trader for that matter, but combining the two methods to get us buying and selling on small retraces of the main trend may have much merit. Anyway thanks siobi, amlo and everyone else here!!!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Well Siobi i give up lol !!! i registered with Crown forex and it has 5 digits and it still doesnt work oh well, i will try another EA you made in the past

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Might as well try IBFX demo. Doesn't cost anything, and you'll be on the same page. Let me know and we'll take it from there.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Yes It works GREAT.....Thanks Siobi

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Thansk Don i just downloaded it and its been 15 min it's running didnt take a trade yet and i missed 50 pip move well its on demo but even tho lol !!! heres my screenshots of the settings of IBFX, i fel so noobish i never had a hard tiem like this thanks in advanced again

--- 帖子 #419 ---
hi there, sorry for keeping you in deep sea.. ibFX is running 4 digit and please set the Num_of_Digit to False as per the screen capture... (in fact there is a remark over there saying set to True if 5 digit...) cheers...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Well i didi try it and it still does'nt work ??? this is weird Thanks anyways

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Siobi, Great work, thanks for share. I am forward testing R06 for 2 days in Alpari UK (5 digits) and IBFX. No order in Alpari UK with Num_Of_Digit to true, great results with IBFX... But maybe the problem with 5 digit is not in your EA, maybe the problem is in any of the *indicators* the EA is using. Also, I think will be usefull if MagicNumber and Comment (of OrderSend) will be "extern" so tester could change if necessary. Regards.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I lost 41 pips with IBFX demo in Asian session last nite with the latest version of this EA. Oh well, maybe better luck tonite!

--- 帖子 #423 ---
hi there, sorry to hear that you are making lose while I'm still in the profit run. my daily profit target is 20~30pip . SL target is 45 pip = 3 lose trade.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
30 pip and that's it for today!!!!

--- 帖子 #425 ---
siobi....may be mistaken, but think I read on here you are using IBFX $100 demo account. Anyway that's also what I'm using and would like very much for you to post a photo of your current Input Settings. Thanks in advance....keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #426 ---

siobi....will you post your Input Settings for us to see? Also, looking at your chart from the last session, you don't appear to be using your latest version....104R6. Like you, I'm using IBFX with $100 starting balance, none of our trades from this latest session are the same. I had 9 total trades....3 losing trades/6 winning trades The three losers hit the 15 pip ($1.50 USD) SL for a 60 pip ($6.00 USD)....six winners totaled 32 pips ($3.20 USD). Total....28 pip ($2.80) loss for session. Don't know if anyone else on this thread is having problems with your communications, but I fear this thread will fade out and die if our communications does not improve. Hope this doesn't happen because I believe your EA is really good!

I need help badly, My Alpari platform seems not to agree with this EA and its indicators, each Time I try to open the template my platform crashes and close, Any clue anybody? as to what is wrong could I have done anything wrong?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Are you using Vista? If not I would retrace my steps in installing mt4 and template, ea, and indicators. Also look in the journal and experts to find any clues to the problem. Try different things like installing indicators and ea, but don't open the template and see if that works. I had some issues too and tried the above and finally got things moving.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Are you just demoing at the present? If so, just switching to an IBFX demo might solve all your problems!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
thank you guys for you fast response. Yes Im using vista I actually Demo traded on IBFX and now wantedd to move to mY Alpari where I have my account thats where Im hitting the wall. it actually worked on Ibfx but wont work on my alpari

siobi....I think you have a good EA here, but you haven't posted anything in almost two days. If you really care about this thread and intend to keep it going, you need to be more active on here and answer some of our questions. Otherwise, I'm afraid many of us will just get frustrated and move on to another thread! Please see my post #431....if possible, please post a photo of your Input Settings....think that would help all of us be on the same page as you. And even though I downloaded your latest version EA on the first page/first post of this thread, it doesn't seem to be the version you're using. Please compare your chart/indicators with mine in post 431 and you'll see the difference. Thanks in advance for your help!

I feel rather bad that at one point while collaborating with siobi and amlo77 I sugessted that we keep the latest versions to ourselves at least temporarily untill we prove a certain level of profitability, at which point we figure out how best to proceed. My thoughts on the subject are that if too many people download a completely free version, there will be literally millions of copies throughout the world making the same trades at the same times and it may cause brokers - whether dealing desks or straight through processing types to counter the influx of similar trades. That has basically happened to fapturbo, and various dealers are dealing with that in different ways like perhaps widening spreads , in order to keep liguidity feeds going at those times - especially during the off hrs. I believe. This scenario can be mitigated by simply selling the latest profitable version, accepting donations for a fair amount, and in addition the buyers of the ea, donating a percentage of their winnings. That way we limit the number of ea's out there, and therefore minimizing the risk that it will be countered by various means like widening the spreads while it trades, or outright banning it like ... Securities did to fapturbo. As I stated to siobi, I would be more than happy to donate, buy, and/or send a fair percentage of any profit I would be making. And it seems, as of the last two statements, although a bit too early, the ea can do no wrong, in which case it is worth quite a bit. And while some dealers tout that they have no dealing desk and welcome ea's the reality changes for some of them when a truly profitable ea comes along. He has stated to me that he would rather freely distribute it to anyone here, but I believe a donation - according to the each persons means - would be the least we owe him for his dedication and his willingness to share. Now I'm looking to test the latest version on a live account with low lots. Both IBFX and my newly opened FXDD account. And from there who knows...

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hello Dan, I second that. I can donate a little to start as my trading account size is not that large at this time but I do suggest people donate something to Siobi for all his contributions. I can always donate more as my account grows. I am sure other people can do that as well. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #439 ---
That would be coming real close to violating Forex Factory rules which clearly states that nothing is to be sold on this forum. I know that you are using the term donate but that is basically saying the same thing. Siobi knows what happened with the creator of the basics of this EA "CD". After using the forum to help create his EA he then decided to sell it and was banned from the forum. This forum is too important to the trader and to programmers to risk being banned and labeled like this. There are plenty of good programmers on this forum that create different types of EAs. I use at least four profitable EAs so my broker doesn't really know my style of trading. I do have a couple of base routines that I stick to to give me my 30 to 50 pips per day but I'm just a small fish in a sea of whales. I think if we respect the forum and abide by the rules we will be profitable as the forum is designed to create profitable traders or it will lose it members to other forums. But that is just my thoughts. Cheers

--- 帖子 #440 ---
You could not be 100% more incorrect. Did you see the word donate come from Siobi?? No, you did not. Also, next time you make a post make sure you goto an online dictionary and look up the word donation and the word selling? Big Difference in meaning. I do not assume and neither should you. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Well I stand corrected, just using caution in protecting siobi's integrity on this forum. No harm intended.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
In any case siobi has stated that he wants to freely distribute it to everyone here and I certainly respect and even applaud his kindness. From there, it would be up to us to reward him in our own way. Obviously if you make a million, or even a hundred and don't "thank" him, that would be bad karma indeed!

hi all, as from the hard work from dan, amlo and others, I think currently we are looking for a great FREE system. I dont mean for sell and it is all FREE. guys, dont worry about all the varies version out there at the moment. my V105R6 tested for a week and resulted 30 pip per day and I stop trade once i get my 30 pip. I DO NOT post the V105R6 yet here at FF. I need another week testing and preparing the user guide for this EA because it is now includes with the EXIT strategy. I'm not CD, and I do not sell this EA in FF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont plan to let guest to download the latest EA. only active member in this thread are welcome to pm me and I'll send it to you guys. in return, you MUST post your result here. Good luck guys for pip hunting. I'm quite busy last week and this coming 2 weeks because of Chinese New Year. I'm a chinese, yes a malaysian chinese.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
siobi, and all, I have been derelict in not having posted in the thread yet, but I am avidly and actively keeping up with it, *and* demo-ing the versions for weeks. siobi and team are all about the EA being tweaked and re-calibrated to finesse the intended market! Good stuff! Regards, and best to all. Ron

" Good luck guys for pip hunting. I'm quite busy last week and this coming 2 weeks because of Chinese New Year. I'm a chinese, yes a malaysian chinese ."

Hello Siobi, today is the first day of Chinese New Year...Wish you Happy "牛“ year....and Gong Xi Fa Cai.....

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hi anyone, Just curious if the EA will open/close trades or we have to open/close the trade manually? This EA shows only alert buy/sell signal on my platform.... (GOOD signal). Thanks

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi siobi! Happy Chinese New Year! I was living in KL for 2 years. Nice country! Unfortunately I had to go back to Austria! I was checking on your system for a while and got good results with v104 R4 so far. With v104 R6 I was not successful. I compared your system with FXPrime from CD and do not see a lot of similarities. Yours is a scalping system and CD's system is for a different scalping style. Am I right? And many thanks for sharing your great system with us!!!! Manuel

Hi guys I am running v6 version on alpari it opened one trade on last thurday nothing after that, I was wondering if anyone have that problem and if they fixed it .. desiboy

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi siobi, I have downloaded and test out on my demo a/c.However,it does not have the same results as you guys.Do you exit manually?is it possible to have a tp on the EA to be on the conservative side?like what you do,u hit 30pips in a day u wil stop trading.if a trade hit maybe 10pips,then 3 trades will do the job.Just my suggestion.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hello Siobi, Long time I didn`t contact you, I had to stop trading for a month but Im back. I am starting to test your last EA version. I will post my results here. I hope your 1.05 testing be succesfull. Regards Jose

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Im going crazy right now because this Siobi's EA have refused to work on my Alpari platform. I will go over it again and continue to go over it till it works, I hope Siobi's up coming version will solve my problem, And the manual he talked about will also help a great deal because I guess I must be doing something wrong since its working for everybody

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hello Siobi I have removed and reinstalled the entire EA and indicators but I still get the same crash problem, Im using Alpari 5digit platform and Vista could it be that the indicators are not designed to be compatible with any of these. Pls Im really worried. Can someone please help me. Thanks

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi, I am a newbie here.. trying to test the EA .... cheers

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=26799 My friend, you need to google "vista and mt4 problems". Drunk as I am right now - recent bad surprise financial problems - I can still function enough to tell you that. I adore helping people, but you need to google things. Almost every answer to the human universe is on the net. (If only I can find the answer to my financial wowes on the net...) ...Oh wait, it may be Siobi's latest EA. Anyway, "very strong security policy on your Vista" may be your problem. Let me know when I'm sober if you don't find the answer. (I don't use any overtaxing apps. like Vista when it comes to making money - I don't need to take a Cadillac to a job that pays millions, just a Civic) Home, business, "ultimate"..................................................WTF????!!!!! Now that Gates is gone, they're smoking crystal meth over there!!!!!!!!!!!!! ...And a few pills just for good measure!!! (Does look pretty though...especially when you're tripping. All those sideways windows!!!!!!!!) Almost like 3d studio max! PS: Don't worry untill you get to where I'm at! LOL. Even then, don't lose your sense of humor and humanity!

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Dan....sorry for your financial problems, hope all works out....but have to say, the problem with this thread isn't yours....it's siobi's! Folks on here want this thread to succeed, but need communications straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak. Appreciate your efforts! When a person starts a thread then just appears occasionally to say that they've made their 30 nightly pips and goodnite....won't work and won't survive. We need questions answered and information....not getting either! Hope things change for the better....and soon!

--- 帖子 #459 ---
They certainly will! Having corresponded with Siobi directly, I can uniquivocally tell you that he is a better person than myself. I'm a great guy, but I know the reality of human nature. He is light years beyond me, so we must respect his timeframe. We all have families and other pressing issues, and this thread will certainly progress at the right timeframe. ....Hey kind like fx... LOL No one is in more of a hurry for success than me, as Bush has destroyed much of the American middle class (WHY IS ONE WARPED HUMAN BEING ALLOWED TO RULE OVER AN ENTIRE CONTINENT - WORLD), but we must respect Siobi's timeframe. Success will come soon, I'm sure, as long as we are patient for the universe to deliver to the worthy. Sorry to get so metaphysical for those of us less spiritual! LOL

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks John for your advice, for your advice despite your financial woes, Thats the spirit mate, helping others when your own problems are piled up. You will turn around soon and wont find them again. I really have not rested on this problem. Im sure Im not the only one using Vista thats why Im more confused, have searched all I can for the solution to this crashes when I load up the Siobi system but found nothing. Its damn so frustrating. Ok than lets assume its the tight security policy on my vista is the problem, do you have an idea of what and how to loosen it up. Thanks

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Any way people I have been troubleshooting this platform crash problem that I encounter each time I try to set up this Siobi's system, I think the problem is form the indicators, these three precisely: Fx prime, T3MA, XPMA. I try to attach all the indicators one by one to a chart, the rest didnt give any problem but each time I try attaching any of these three (Fx prime, T3MA, XPMA) an error/crash message will pop up and my platform will close by itself immediately. Can some one pls upload the these 3 indicators if yours are working very well, and If you do pls indicate which windows (XP or Vista) you are using and broker too. Thanks people for all your support

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I have all the ind's onmy ibfx demo account and both on xp and vista no problem. Try doing this go to help go to about and see what version and build u have it should be 4.00 and build 220 if u don't have it, do a live update on your mt4 hopefull that should fix it. desiboy

Hi all, sorry for all the late reply. I'm havinh a hard time here at my hometown using my hp as my only internet access... damn stuid telco...(maxis, if you are from malaysia).... I'm using unlimited GPRS service to get me online and I had bad internet now... after screen thru all the posts.. conclusions: 1) Vista problem. answer: I'm running vista from the beginning of this thread. It shouldnt be any problem for a vista user. the problem might be from your broker platform. I do have alpari running in my NB with Vista. I can said NO PROBLEM. I'm running mt4 version 4, build 220. 2) signal correctness: I'm now doing a full test on V105R6 which I do not test on V104 at the moment, I do not know how is the signal going in V104. Sorry I had no comment. Previously I'm running V104 at home and running V105 in my test NB, but now bear in mind, I'm only having 1 NB with me at my hometown, so I decide to do the full test of V105R6. I think I had explaint it earlier. One and for last, I dont mind if you commented me on anything as I NEVER request anything from public and all for the good will for the public and it is all FREE. No one should charge this system or EA for money. now economic is very bad, not USA, not EURO, not Japan, not England.... but is whole world including here in malaysia. our company start cut pay and retrenchment. I really hope this EA will help those people with a single condition. you contribute more here in FF, only I'll give u my final V105R6 which returns 19 pip today in Japan session. I had email to 2 person V105R6 and they are all contributed in this thread as below: dan, amlo. regards, siobi... PS: I burn my finger and get injured an hour ago because of the fire crackers...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi, I think it is normal... at least for V104. I've been running it for couple of days and ran into the same situation a few times. However, the number of active trades never went beyond 3..... I'm not sure though whether the logic of the EA controls the maximum number of active trades to be 3 or it is just that the conditions were not met for any additional trades. I've been running the EA for 22 hours (1-23 GMT) a day and the result is mixed. This version recommends manual closing of trades, but I let the EA close the trades as well. With manual closing results could have improved significantly - there were trades with &gt;30 pips up, but ended up with only +1 pip. Since this is a scalping technique, one should not let that happen. I'm just trying to get a feeling of how this EA (any EA for that matter.... this is the 1st one I'm trying) works on its own. As I'm not following the rules strictly, I'm not going to post my results yet. Thanks Siobi for the EA and the teaching you rendered in this forum. Happy New Year and enjoy the holiday! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Siobi, I for one have appreciated all your hard work and free contributions. It is amazing to me how demanding some people can be of your time, when you are contributing your hard work and efforts all free of charge and asking nothing in return. I have posted my results on and off on my IBFX live account. I regret that my job prevents me from making more contributions, and at this time am only a part time trader with the dream of one day being able to make aliving douing so. I have gained so much from this forum in my part time trading career. I will be glad to continue to contribute when I can, and I truly appreciate the free contributions you and so many other's make on this forum, all in the name of helping fellow traders hopefully one day make it to true financial freedom! Yours truly, Sir Viver. (Andy)

On the common tab of the EA does allow dll imports have to be checked. If so why?

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Siobi or anyone, It seems that the EA stops taking trades after certain amount of time. So far I ran two versions of the EA (V104r2 and V104r6) and each stopped taking trades after about 24 hours. The EA is still running with the same parameter setting as before, but now it only has the pop up alert about the up and down signals. But no more trades are taken, even though it shows 'inside trading times' and smiley face at the top right corner of the chart. Is the EA available in the forum designed this way, i.e., to give the user a taste of it for about 24 hours or there is something that I'm doing wrong? Please advise. Thank you.

hi Siobi i just happen to found your ea on last week before i go for chinese new year holiday.

Hi I have demo testing this since the 15 of Jan 09 and attached is my statement. I am running the FX_1m_Boouncing_V104. I all so have an Excel sheet sorted profit and I see that my biggest losses closed at 16:30, 23:03, 23:00 GMT. So I am thing maybe I should close my trades 8:00 GMT. My one minute chart will not go back far enough to look at the chart. Thanks You Barry

I was just reading thru the threads... Dan, take it easy...life, like forex is peaks and troughs...I'm hopeful you'll get through your issues....try not to drink a lot...it will not help... try Yoga !!! LOL...it would probably be more helpful... Siobi, I hope your finger gets better...don't let the kids play with the fireworks... One thing I wanted to mention, obvious, but I think pertinent, is that Siobi evidently has a firm understanding of how forex works. He is obvisouly a chartist...it may suit everyone's needs to learn to trade manually as well as trade with an EA.....get a clear understanding of "why" the program wants to trade... Maybe some of y'all do and maybe some of y'all don't. The ones that do not would benefit greatly by learning the hows and whys... I really hope that for those that intend to rely on an EA like this one, that it works for you... Best of luck to you all!

Thank you and all my good friends here!!! No matter what happens, we are all progressing, I have no doubt about that!

I found that having a 5min. chart with qqe cross alongside the siobi template gives me a broader view of the 1m/5m microtrends. (QQE idea from bonten) If we can ride these "waves" we'll do very well. Maybe catch the qqe early on the 1m then get qqe confirmation on the 5m qqe cross. Ride the trend for as long as you see fit, then use one of the 1m qqe cross - which of course happen more often - to exit untill the next 5m qqe cross. I used to try to time the peaks and bottoms and trade the retrace, but have been burned when it just keeps going and going. Doesn't happen that often, but without the right pipstep and lot sizing, account can burn. I am obviously trying to ride the wave (trend) on the 5m with early signals - some false - on the 1m. Seems to work well. Let's not let this thread die, as it has MUCH merit!

Ok, lesson learned! ...Only one click of "close all open positons" script will close all open positions. ...Just wanted to blue highlight it when I was "actually' ready to do so!!!

Hello friend! You will have to ask siobi when he comes back, as there are different versions out there. They all have their benefits, but more work will have to be done to make them nearly perfect. Yes, nearly perfect with the input of various experts, of which I am not, is achieavable! When I'm drunk and reckless -demo account - I can do almost no wrong!!! Profit galore! ...I go to my live acc. sober and lose $500 every time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No, I don't have the balls to trade my live acc. deep drunk!!!!

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thanks Ohka, and others. I just opened an fxdd acc. (demo for now) and am having trouble with the "close all open orders" script. I copied it directly from my ibfx mt4 and it's not closing all the open orders and giving me the below alert box message. (error:4109). Strangely it also at first didn't close all orders on my ibfx mt4, but I have no idea what I did that now it closes all open orders on that mt4. Completely perplexed, and I have googled it and found a handful of others with same prob. and no answer. If anyone can help I'd greatly appreciate it. Maybe something to do with compiling etc. Not an expert with mt4 obviously. Thanks and let's keep this going. ...It's obviously a great template, as can be seen in the second screenshot a few hrs. later. Many pips today. I just hope this good thing doesn't just die!

We thought you deserted us! We've got to hurry and come up with an automated grail, because I have NO discipline and always occasionally go against what has made me major pips. And of course I lose the previous day's - or two - gains. Not the whole account, but enough to let me know that I "HAVE NO DISCIPLINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I need a robot, before I lose my house! Yes I will have a sense of humor till the very end! ...Everything is relative.:nerd: Welcome back Siobi!!!!!!!!! PS: I hope I didn't throw you off track too much, as going against the 1m microtrend on the retraces usually makes great pips as long as you pipstep your way up or down correctly. ....Untill you hit a "MAJOR" microtrend, at which time you will lose much of the account if not done correctly. I'm still working on the "done correctly" part, and have started to appreciate going "with" the trend more. ....We all know "trend is your friend" etc. etc., even on the 1m charts. That's where your magic comes in: blending the two, which is not easy to say the least. Ranges and trends are tricky devils when combined! Again welcome back!

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Let's wait for Siobi to post latest version and will take it from there, my friend. (...Been doing manual trading and testing fapturbo which has insane drawdowns and crazy stoplosses. ...Maybe I just don't know the right settings!?! If there's going to be an insane drawdown, it's going to be done by ME, dammit! ...And even I haven't managed a 70 pip drawdown yet, as I start to panic at 7. (Granted I'm working on the 1m and and fapturbo "scalper" is on the 15m.) We'll get you going don't worry!

12 or so pip move up in no time: (This may be mainly an older template, but will be checking it out.) fx50 I believe, not sure. Will most likely look at kino's latest template next.

Hi Dan! I am also testing FAPTurbo at the moment but I am also not lucky! I think it is the volatile market!!! For setting you could check on fapturboforum.com. Btw I heard that FXDD is not a good broker company for FAPT! I hope it is getting better! Good luck!

I will defer to Siobi's judgement what template would do best. I must have 1376 different templates at the moment that I've messed with. ...Ok not that many, but close. Would that qualify as "template hopping"? You are more than welcome to any of them including the last one I posted (I think based on fx50 or something.) Will post that one when at my other computer, but again, Siobi knows best. Will be back soon. Here is the last one you saw in my post:

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Live calls anyone? It'll have to work on the 4hr+ charts for that I suppose. Not bad signal this one though.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Does the EA require that I have the indicators on the chart? I do have the slope and stoch rsi on the chart.........but no trades as of yet. thx, todd

--- 帖子 #504 ---
No, I think that should be ok as long as they are in the ea/indicators folder. Probably will be a bit more selective taking trades being on the 15minute. Untill then, another nice signal. Maybe I'm having flashbacks, but I think when purple and yellow indicators cross the black together, we have maybe good signal. Not sure will have to watch and watch and watch some more, but notice chart before, and before, and....

--- 帖子 #505 ---
okay .. i'll try it .. last time maybe i downloaded the wrong one ... it didn't open position .. so this time, it should work .. thanks ..

--- 帖子 #506 ---
hello again, same problem here. ea doesnt open positions. has it something to do with the magic number parameter ? what is it for, do i have to change the number in order to get the ea working?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
You should leave the default magic # I believe. Just make sure any other ea you may be using doesn't have the same one. Highly unlikely. LOL. I think it's normal for this time of trading. Not much action on the 15m at the moment. Just got some action on the 1m after dead range. If on the 1m with the posted template, make sure market has some "volume" or you'll die from a thousand small cuts taking any signals!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
15 min is comatose, so no trades on ibfx or fxdd here. If I was trading, may take a couple pips here and there on the 1m. ...My "thinking" anyway: Base hits, no homers right now.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
1m signal confirmed by the 5m? That's what it looks like to my tired eyes:

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Hello Folks, i started the ea today at 1am GMT+1 (German Timezone) and its doing very good by now. Every trade was a hit ! Made 30 euros so far (0.1 Lot / Trade ) . Here is the screenshot :

--- 帖子 #511 ---
my backtesting shows this ea to be unprofitable, it has long strings of winners but they're all very very tiny and just one or two losers wipe them all out. and when i tested it on a 5 min chart it has periods where it goes nearly a year without trading then will take 15 in a day. i'm fairly certain my data isnt to blame as i use it to test my own ea's and have never had a problem. has anyone else backtested this and if so do you come up with profitable results?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hello JDelphiki. What size were the stoplosses that wiped the account? The trades that mine took live last night (posted) took 1 or 2 pips in profit per trade. That in itself is not a problem, but if indeed the stops are quite large, then the above scenario which you described will inevitably happen at some point, no matter the hit rate. If you could post any of the backtest information, that may be indispensable to all. Regards.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi tex. Good to see your results! My fxdd account didn't take any trades while my desktop ibfx took 4 posted above. If I may ask, what settings are you using in your slope direction line? Mine seemed out of whack from the start on my fxdd for some reason, while yours hugs price very nicely.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi guys. I want to know if there is a thread dedicated to trading this system manually. As I don't trust ea's, please where can I get the directions to trading this system manually.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Happy to have you here Wahnone! For me, f4mnect and the fx50 threads have been very helpful to say the least. Goes without saying that I enjoy the hard work everyone here - especially Siobi of course - has done, but this is Siobi's thread, and I already feel as if I took it over from him, so he would be the one to ask what specific template is best suited to his newest ea. At the moment I personally like the latest template I posted a few posts back, but if you are trading live and having great success, while being eclectic in your trading style is great if you aren't doubling your account monthly, if you are safely and consistently, don't change a thing!!! As a matter of fact your thread will be the next one I take over,.........I mean visit. LOL Thanks again, and will be looking forward to reading and studying your system. ...Which is not stupid by the way!!!

--- 帖子 #516 ---
here's a screenshot of the slope direction line indicator settings (i didn't change them):

--- 帖子 #517 ---
interesting method! pop

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Thanks much! I seem to have same settings but fxdd account dead in water. IBFX takes trades though. ...Anyway my latest template I'm playing with: Named "rob in the hood" since it's a combination of my last posted template and the robinhood-fx method used on the eur/gbp 1m. I think pretty safe to buy on the dips of the main trend as below. (Top indicator may mirror bottom two stochs though. Will have to watch and see.) Hope Siobi doesn't mind the mice playing with templates while the smart cat is away coding ea's.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
My results:

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Notice, with the trailing stop, it would take small pips most of the time, but with rocket moves all is good, very good indeed, ...untill it hits the 100 pip hard stop every so often, which looks to be in place from the backtest. Oh, but what a good day for v106!!!!

--- 帖子 #521 ---
just downloaded this EA this morning, and it took one trade so far this morning (+44pips). Live on ibfx...

--- 帖子 #522 ---
hello, more results from me : i am up to 186,86 euros in 2 two days. the ea's doing very good

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hello everyone, I'm Alex and I'm also an EA programmer. I just found this very interesting system and after backtesting it a bit, I must say I'm very impressed with its accurate entries and good trade management. The only drawback seems to be the 100 pip hard-coded stop loss which it hits on occasion and wipes out quite a bit of hard-earned profit. Here are some suggestions that may minimize this drawback: - Set the stop loss number in the external input so that we can customize it and possibly use a lower stop loss without disrupting its profitability. - Use some indicator to detect when the market is in a trending mode and stay out of trades during this time. - Detect the current trend (up or down) from the higher timeframes and only trade longs or shorts based on the prevailing trend. If there is anything that I can help out in terms of modifying the EA code, I'm most happy to contribute. Overall, I think this is a really great EA. Probably it just needs a bit of tweaking to get the best out of it.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Alextsui, how can I contact you with private messages? thanks in adavce

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hi All, very interesting system, I am trying it since last night but only one trade taken, is it everything correct? regards, iopoipoi

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi Iopoipoi, I've enabled private messaging now. You can send private messages to me. Thanks. Regards, Alex

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Welcome. Mine hasn't taken a trade since my last posted screenshot, so far today paramaters not met I guess.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
The EA is taking trades for me. So far it has taken 9 trades all + mostly 1 to 2 pips profit, just two trades with 41pips and 19 pips.. it's working good...

--- 帖子 #529 ---
3 in dd right now, but hope they come out winners. (All buys)

--- 帖子 #530 ---
no trade for me for last 2 hours.. waiting..

--- 帖子 #531 ---
i got EUR USD .. 2 TP and 2 SL

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Could someone post his/her settings? I don´t understand but my EA is not doing any trades! Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #533 ---
hello everyone, the ea's doing good, it got me a few more pips since the last screenshot :

--- 帖子 #534 ---
mine too

--- 帖子 #535 ---
ms119....I'm using this latest version 106 on IBFX demo with default settings....10 trades = +76 pips....last trade 5 hrs. ago.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Same here. Default. As per backtests, 100 pip hardstop may kill account at some point. We need to work on best possible entries I think. Maybe use xpma indicator instead of slope direction line? Not an expert, but xpma on multitimeframes like 1m xpma confirmed by 5m xpma? Maybe even further filtered by 15m xpma? (Still in a trade at approx. 70 pip drawdown) We are certainly evolving.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Also notice how bottom 3 indicators on the last template posted all mostly agree. T3 RSI alert looks interesting too as an entry trigger, then take a predetermined profit target based on timeframe range, and wait for next signal and repeat. So many possibilities. Thanks Kino for your indicators.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi all, EA is taking lots of trades but I'm trying to limit it to only Asian session. I'm trading on IBFX. The only time setting I see is Close Hour and is set at default for 30. Seems to trade 24hrs at this setting. Anyone know how to set for just Asian Session? Many thanks! Sir Viver.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
hello, yes thats right the ea's taking trades all around the clock and it's doing good. It think we do have to wait for siobi, he stated earlier that he would explain the parameters soon. EA made another +52 pips yesterday with two trades. One trade was temporarily down to -78 pips but didnt hit the -100p hard stop.Then the market changed direction and the trade got green again Here's the screenshot :

--- 帖子 #540 ---
hi tex version 6, should i place the indicators on the chart ?? the ea is not trading , where can i find the tpl for this version thanks for your help

--- 帖子 #541 ---
hello samer960, the template was uploaded by dan johnston just a few pages before in this thread. u dont have to place the indicators, its all done in dan's template. greets, tex

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi guys. Remember that I'm fairly new to all this too, but let me try to help as best I could. On post #497 you will find the ea, and two indicators (The first two are the indicators) Put indicators in the experts/indicators folder of mt4 and put the last file (v106) in the experts folder. From there, all you have to do is open mt4 and drag and drop the ea to any template (or plain 15m chart) you want. It should call up the indicators even if you don't actually have them dragged to your chart. If you like the latest template that I uploaded, go to post #501 and put the template file in the metatrader/templates folder, and the indicators in same place as the actual ea indicators as per above. This specific template will actually contain (automatically drag and drop) the actual ea (v106) from Siobi's post #497, but you have to go through the above steps - putting the ea in the correct folder first as above. Remember that this is just a template that I have gotten used to and doesn't by any means imply that it is good or otherwise. Use whatever template that allows you to understand priceaction best. As a matter of fact, when Siobi posts next he may very well have another template to use. Any problems please post and we'll all help. Cheers all!!!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi Dan , Would you mind if you would briefly explain your strategy and set up of the charts / pairs and ea settings and are you doing well as far as wins/loses in a real acount now. Thanks in advance,,,,,,,,, Tom

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I had a long response all written up and once I made a screenshot of my latest results (below) I lost all I wrote. Actually, that's most likely a good thing!!! The short of it is that I lost almost 30% of my live account months ago and had to reevaluate my trading. Have come a long way since then with the kind help of everyone here, but still a ways to go. Probably the most valuable thing I learned since, is to look at priceaction (by whatever means works for the specific individual, whether that means 100 indicators or a naked bar chart) and begin to see reoccuring patterns and act accordingly. I like to make the analogy of the Cheetah and the Gazelle. It uses instinct and experience to pounce and get it's meal quickly. ...I, at the moment, like the shorter timeframe charts. Quick in and out. I just have to learn to hang on for more than a handful of pips when I see a clear trend. I'm a work in progress that's for sure!!! As far as the ea goes, it's one of the easiest ea's to set up since we leave all at default values for the most part. My results are below: Regards.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Anyone ride the euro rocket up today? Wish I still had my live acc. funded . Actually on second thought .......................................... Anyone that has results for v106 please post. Don't be shy.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
hello dan, heres the actual ea v06 result for today. i posted a screenshot before, but the post is gone. strange. okey what i wrote in the deleted post was that i do think too (like alex a few pages before), that we have to further improve the ea. a customizeable hard stop would be very nice for example. i hope siobi will come back soon and do a little change to the ea, so it will get better and better.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I'm sure he will! Unlike me, who has been taken advantage of by Bernie Madoff type individuals, he has a more sharing type personality. Even so I do the best I can under my present circumstances. Good people need to stick together and take advantage of "technology" to defeat the - still there - hungry dinosaurs that are there to prey upon us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks !!! That sounds pretty much were Im at in this forex thing . I think Siobis will have this Ea in tip top shape before its over . If we cant make money one way well find anouther .Thanks for the input ..Cheers Tom

--- 帖子 #549 ---
sorry guys, letting Dan and others to carrying this thread for so long...Financial REcession is really killing.. I'm now having 2 EA.V104 and V106. V104 is had been re-configure to 30M. V106 is running on 15M. I had few week testing on DEMO and resulted as per my setting is the best... you are encourage to close the trade anytime as per your wish since I had set the SL to 100 pip. V104 is working on Slope and PSAR concept + Storch RSI and ADX as well.below is the formula. (RSI&gt;=55) (Slope is blue) &amp;&amp; (PSAR pointing up) &amp;&amp; (adx_5M &gt;= 25) &amp;&amp; (adx_15M &gt;= 25) &amp;&amp; then go for LONG.!!!I had set the trailing stop to 25 pip and trade only japan session and close all trade 1 hour after the japan closed. V106 is working on Slope and MA concept. once the price bar crossing up to MA50 line from below MA50, and previous 3 bars showing all BLUE in slope direction line then I take the Buy.Al closer the 8EMA line and 21EMA line to SMA50 line, the better the result it is... but the V106 still not yet taking in this condition.... maybe later stage. I hope my brief explaination will clear up the doubts on the EA I posted. and happy trading. PS: The main reason I change all my strategy from 1M scalping to trending scalping is because of the spread issue. the longer the time frame the less trade we take but the more accurate result I get to aviod the broker is playing on the price and spread.as for the setting of those indicator, after running the EA in the Strategy tester, click open chart and you should be able to view all the indicator and setting used.

a clear winning trade today and hit my daily target of 30 pip. Sweet day!!!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
manual Closed at 49 pip... remember to turn off the EA or else the EA will immediately take another tradebecause it scan thru and found that no open trade for the SELL and it will open another SELL trade. Take care and good day!!!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
later after V104 and V106... I'll continue on something what we call trend trading system... it is also work on PSAR, MA concept.... oh GOD, I'm now stick to RSI,MA,PSAR and FIBO.... these indicators are giving very good signal at 15M and 30M chart... scalping for 1M is rather hard nowadays....

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks Siobi! Keep up the great work! While we test both ea's, I'm playing with different templates, the one below showing perfect trade - which I wish I had taken live. (notice all indicators agreeing and ma's crossing) Template is a mix of different systems that very kind people shared here, and if anyone is interested I'll post it. Just be warned that there are heavily repainting indicators used, and need to be traded as original author, mtuppers specified. So if you don't like repainting incicators, skip this post, because care must be taken.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Siobi, The way to prevent multiple, consecutive sell orders is to declare a static variable to track your last executed trade, then in the section of code before your next trade execution you check the direction of your prior trade. Remember to initialize your static variable to NULL/Empty value. Normally I define my static variable after the external parameter variables. In the section of code below, assume the SellSig variable is set based on the set of conditions the EA determines is appropriate to trigger a sell order. Example: ======= // Intialization section. static string LastSig=""; // Trade execution section. // CHECK FOR ANY OPEN ORDERS AGAINST THIS PAIR. for(cnt = 0; cnt &lt; total; cnt++) { OrderSelect(cnt, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES); if(OrderSymbol()==Symbol()){ SymOrdTotal++; } } if ( SellSig != 0 &amp;&amp; LastSig != "SELL" &amp;&amp; (SymOrdTotal == 0 || LastSig == "" ) ) { OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_SELL, Lots, Bid, 3, Bid+StopLoss*Point, Bid - TakeProfit*Points,"BARS EAV2", 15555, 0, Red); LastSig = "SELL"; if(GetLastError() == 0) Print("Sell Order Opened: ", OrderOpenPrice()); return(0); } Hope this helps to solve your multiple order problem. Jam

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Jam, Thanks for the advise, no prblem. I can totally understand your advise. I had take care of te multiple order using Bar count. same as your concept but I'm using a static variable to keep the order bar count. eg: I sell at Bar no 1000, then for the same Bar count 1000, I woill not place another order. I think I'm confuse on my previous post of multiple order. I recheck the code and I can reassured that it is implemented in both EA....

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hi all, Today, V104 30M had another clear win. Since my daily target is 20~30 pip... so I decided to close manually while it hits 30pip profit... but again re-quotes kill off my 4 pips.. anyway, today is done... clear win 26 pip... cheers!!!!!

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Siobi, You mentioned in post #551 that you had to shut down the EA otherwise it would execute another Sell trade if you close the trade manually, which is why I supplied the code in my previous post - it will prevent that condition from occuring since the EA would still be tracking the last trade execution regardless of whether the trade by the EA or manually. This would effectively prevent multiple sell orders from being generated. If your Bar Count solution works, then great, but consider adding the code as an additional protective measure to your Bar Count method. It's your code so do with it as you wish - just thought I'd provide a small contribution to your programming efforts. Besides, it would only add a few CPU cycles of overhead. Great job on the EAs and thanks for your time and effort - I've not experienced the success rates being published, but I'm sure those will come in due time. UPDATE: One last thing - you may wish to consider incorporating clear trade exit rules for the EA so others who are helping out with testing of the EA across multiple brokers have the same rules in place and don't have to rely on personal decision-making and second-guessing themselves. I prefer a completely robotic, automated EA versus one that relies on subjectivity. Jam

--- 帖子 #558 ---
hi Jam, thanks and really appreciate your helping hand. sorry for the missleading post at #551. the EA is fully automated. the exit strategy is NOT fully implemented and it is now by Trailing stop concept. since my daily target s 20~30 pip, so I decided to close manually once it hits my target. cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Ok, this is my second day with this new template, and I believe a very simple ea can be programmed around this very simple method: 1)Price approaches upper or lower bollinger bands - default settings. 2)Check 50 ema or equivalent to get a sense of lower 3 timeframe trend (maybe only go with a not too consolidated sideways market - or with trend only, not against since it may not overshoot bollinger band, which is what we want). 3)Hear the distinctive "tweet ding" of the supersignals indicator - which repaints like crazy - and be ready with an order AGAINST indicator. 4)Wait till you are in profit - usually within seconds and usually 2 or more pips - and be quick with a "close all open positions" script (alt c keystroke shortcut for me) 5)Make sure price is close to or touching respective outer bollinger band otherwise do not take audible signal. It all happens quite quickly, so a simple ea would be amazing . On the 1m you would pick up 2 pips at a time many times during the day, and since you are not exposing yourself to the market for any appreciable amount of time, the stoploss would be MINIMAL !!! ...Maybe 4 pip stop since it usually rockets to give min. 2 pips. (Somethimes when I see I'm 4 pips up and hit the keystroke shortcut I only end up with 2 pips and occasionally with 1 pip when I see I'm 2 up, since I have too many applications running on a small notebook.) But right now I'm testing with large lots because of small take profit. Further rules can be implemented, but it doesn't get any better than this!!! ...So far anyway. While I wrote this I missed a few more signals which would have netted another 2-6 pips with my aging reflexes! Furthermore, you can trade it from one "true" signal to another using the signal line, etc. - It gives many false early signals, which is actually why the aforementioned method works I guess, but for now I just want my 2 pips every time using this "reversed" strategy!!! PS: Notice below, had I stayed in a little longer, I would have netted more than what I got. That's more than OK with me if this proves to work the vast majority of time!!!!!!!!!! Damn, ritht now I just missed another awsome signal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #560 ---
That signal sound is becoming music to my ears!!!! (I need to calm down, I may just be dreaming!!!) Here's the signal I missed while writing my "PS" of the post above:

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Or some would just go with the obvious 1m strong trend and not bother with any of that other stuff. ....But we have yet to find a foolproof ea concerning trends, or bounces for that matter. ....Siobi's amazing efforts notwithstanding. Time will tell in both cases though.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Could have held on to the position and made much more, but at $50 a pip even on demo I'm chicken! An ea would fix that.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Got bored waiting for a signal according to the above posts and decided to play around in between the bollinger bands at non volatile period. What fun that was as can be seen below. I might keep this hedge on for the duration of this demo account and keep trading. Wonder what swap will do to it?LOL

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi dan, I personally do not think that 1M scalping can last long... perhaps you may try to find the same signal in higher time frame? the main reason for 1M scalping is because the Live and DEMO account having different price movement depanding on the broker... I had loss quite an amount of money in live for scalping in 1M. that is the main reason I switch my stratgy all to higher timeframelike 15M or 30M.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Thanks Siobi! I actually did trade 1m live some months ago, but like you lost some after having had a decent run. I do realize I will have to deal with my impatience and trade the 5m or longer. And also realize that I don't ALWAYS have to be in the market. Thanks again my friend!

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi dan, Are your trying to post your result ? can you explaint a little on your result? is it running V106? because I saw the comment and play a guess on it.. what is the time frame u r using ? I'm now having 2 NB. let say A and B. A is always fully EA opan and close. B is always manual close once I get my 20~30 pip. I had posted my B result in the forum and later I'll post my A result.... FYI, I had auto EA won 100++pip for the pass 2 days... today is the 3rd day... see how it will do... Cheers!!!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi guys I put those 2 new eas of feb 22 but no trade has been opened on either one, can you please explain i use ibfx and put 5 digits false thanks

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Siobi, yes 106 on 15m full automatic. So far so good!!! (I don't know why all sells, but can't complain) Moshe, v104 now on 30m I think is on post #197 and explaination on post #369 I believe. v106 now on 15m timeframe is on post 497. I believe all the posts above contain their respective indicators also which must go in the indicators folder. (On fxdd broker no opened trades for v104 either yet. Maybe because on 30m it will take less trades, but hopefully more accurate.) Please post again if further problems.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
V104 no open trade on 30M. I let V106 15M testing to dan... I need to concern on V104 30M. For moshebaruh in reading, I hope you try to post your screen info as below: 1) the version commented on the top left. 2) the smile icon 3) the setting screen 4) your platform using how many digit Regards, Siobi

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Guys, Here is the first trade which the 106 EA executed on 15min timeframe for me. I was away from the computer (not usual, picking up the kids) and did not see what actually happened but it exited for 3 tick before the EURUSD took off and is at +40 now (without me on board). I guess there is a trailing stop in the EA but I do not know the criteria... If I am at the computer I would usually manage the trade with a different EA which gives me control over stop loss and target. regards

--- 帖子 #571 ---
so.... V106 also in winning huh? I think the best EA is able to get the max gain, but personally I think best EA is always get the winning trade.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Could have closed this trade manually but I'm testing how ea does it itself:

--- 帖子 #573 ---
hm... the EA exit is based on Trailing stop... so no point to test on it... close it when u think u had enough profit.... normally I'll close about 20~30 pip per trade. I will close all trade always 1 hour after the japan session(regardless win or lose). Both EA V104 and V106 resulted good profit return... V104 having more than 85% winning rate. V106 having more than 70% winning rate.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Past couple of days Siobi's ea is doing better than fapturbo. (notice last trade - highlighted in blue - which is the trade in my last post that I said I could have closed at +$130, trail stopped at +$10.) Had I been monitoring the trade on a live account, I would have had 1m, 5m, and 15m charts alongside each other, and would have exited at +$130, knowing that on the 1m chart the cycle would have reversed, and temporarily taken back those nice pips. I believe that maybe a trade taken on the 15m chart by the ea, would be exited in a better fashion by then looking at the 1m priceaction and exiting by that criteria. That may let the runners gain great pips, while letting the bounces retain more pips - from +13 pips to +1 as per above. That may also mitigate the 100 pip hard stoploss which in time may lead to disaster - at least according to the previous backtests. It's nice to see the larger pip trades coming in, but we also have many +1 pip trades which under different exiting criteria, may turn into more +13 pippers, again solving the occasional 100 pip hard stoploss which will inevitably get hit on occasion - as it did on my other testing on my laptop. Even so, very good results thus far!!! Edit: Hi Siobi, you posted as I was writing this. LOL Yes, when I go live again, will probably have my favorite templates up (1m,5m,and 15m up alongside each other, and let the ea signal me (VERY LOUDLY) so I can track the trade. Being on the east coast US, I would prefer to get my sleep while the ea is trading though, so a fully automatic ea would just about make me the happiest person on this planet if not the galaxy! ...And I think, so far at least, it comes damn close to to that - maybe with an exit strategy like above if possible. Maybe move to +1 at a certain #of pips and then exit when 1m priceaction indicators is telling of a reversal.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
For some reason I can't get v104 to take any trades on fxdd account for past 3 days when I first started it, so no trades taken on the 30m fxdd so far. (Above posts are of ibfx v106 on 15m.)

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Another interesting fact is that when the above +13 pip trade on v106 entered on this desktop, I heard that "tweet ding" that I mentioned on my previous posts regarding my latest templates I'm playing with. (That was on my laptop in the other room.) And as I stated, I found that generally when price approaches the outer bollinger bands, it likes to overshoot, in this last case it being worth 13 or so pips, had I closed the trade manually. (And then of course it changed direction and started going up.) ....Maybe only take trades that approach bollinger bands and we know it will overshoot, taking a few pips every time - say 2 or so pips??? ....Or It very well may be a stupid idea!!! Anyway, we are definitely on our way to something very good I think!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Thanks for all the work on this!! It looks very interesting. I am always blown away by people who can create EA's!!! I read in this thread that there were 7 files to download. I only see the same 2 listed 3 times in the first post. NEVER MIND I see them.

Hi. Post #568 may help you in getting both ea's and their respective indicators.

Hi dan, sounds good on the exit strategy, can you explain a bit detail on your idea? PS: I'm now suffering at SONY to fix BUG....

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Oh no!!! What did I get myself into??!! Asking your dog or cat to explain itself will probably yield more results. ...Anyway, I "THINK" that if we are taking trades on the 15m, then "MAYBE" looking at the 1m - which certainly is a faster predictive indicator of a trend change may get us out of a wining trade before the retrace does at +1 pip. I've only been looking at all three charts (1m,5m,15m) together for a few days, as I remember someone saying "only trade one chart" at some point in my fx education. ...There are many ways to skin a ..............(I hate that saying, as I love my cat!!!) I'm finding that I am getting to start to see synchronicity between these related timeframes, but sadly I'm no genius and it will take time to get the "timing" right, ...if ever. I will say though, that if trading these timeframes, It is in one's best interest to have all three up together to get a full picture of what may happen in the short term (up to 15m). ....So, although I have different templates etc. on different computers, and so can't fully analyze that last trade at the moment, I believe the 1m timeframe would have told me to exit the trade entered by the ea on the 15m at some point before the retrace leaving me with a # of pips between +1 and +13, but not relying on trailing stops alone. Maybe one trailing stop to break even or +1 to give us a free trade, and then exit based on lower timeframe priceaction which will certainly respond to what the bears and bulls are doing at that point in time faster. All that having been said,to put things in proper context, one must realize that I'm certainly no expert!!! ...To say the least!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
break even of 1 pip... then exit based on 1M retracement....

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Now watch that idea fall hard on it's face, and I wasted even more of your time!!! ....Sorry, I mean:

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Looking back on the template posted above with the 18 period bollinger bands, it is very interesting to note how a few pips can almost always be had when price approaches AND THEN OVERSHOOTS the bands before retracing, or even continuing in it's present direction. On the 15m chart I'm looking at now, if we only had a piece of that bollinger band OVERSHOOT every time, our problems would be over. That's basically what that "tweet ding" indicator sound I spoke of in previous posts is also telling me in an "audible" fashion confirming - in my humble opinion anyway - what the "visual" is telling me on this computer. (On my laptop I have 20 period bollingers up, so on this desktop I'm on now with the 18 period bollingers, it's even more apparent that may very well be the case): That price will almost always overshoot and yield a relatively decent # of pips . (Maybe only 2 or more pips depending on timeframe used, but many times a day, with a relatively small hard stop .) .....Or maybe not. Not feeling so sure of myself these days mainly because of the economy. May need more sleep too.

Good luck Siobi. But try to get some sleep. We need you on top of your game!

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Dan, if it is still so for you (or anyone else)...I have gotten zero trades in my FXDD account since installing both EAs when they were released (v104 / v106). I have been through the properties several times trying to sort out why they will not trade. Anyone? Best to all, Ron

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Very strange! If anyone is able to get v104 working with fxdd, they get a prize. ....Prize to be determined. LOL I did get my laptop fxdd acc. v106 to take basically the same trade as the ibfx posted below though (last one for +1pip). FXDD V104 on my desktop is not trading at all, and I think I have all indicators it's based on where they should be. Will wait to see what happens tonight EST.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hmm. Could I be missing an indicator? Would you, Dan, or someone confirm the indicators required for v104 &amp; v106? Thanks! Ron

--- 帖子 #589 ---
maybe you guys have to check the Exprt tab or journal tab.... if there is missing indicator, it should show there... I'm so tired now....... gd day...................

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Thanks Siobi! Till tomorrow my friend. Ron, post #197 contains v104 and all it's indicators, and post #497 ditto for v106 I believe. Let me know how that goes after tonight. Here in Florida, Asian session will start soon. Good pippin!

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Thanks, Dan. I seem to have the indicators and still not trade. All is set properly, How did you do- any FXDD action? Ron

--- 帖子 #592 ---
hello hello, look @ screenshot. v106 took last trade (sell,0.5 lots) at 8:00 gmt+1 german timezone today in the morning. V104 took the last trade at 8:30 gmt+1 german timezone (sell,0.1 lots). V106 made +1 pip. V104 got me +45 pips - so everything is running fine for now, and the ea's are taking trades just a thought - maybe there is problem with your datafeed provider ? can you try it on another demo account ? i am running the v106 on 15m eurusd and the v104 on 30m eurusd. Broker is ActivTrades (England) I didn't close manually, its all fully automated trading. cheers

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Monday :32pip Tuesday:10pip Wednesday: no trade Thursday:No trade Friday: 46 pip Total Win 108 pip. All EA open and close. Cheers!!! any result for V106 guys?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi siobi , I am new about these forum, and I have installed yesterday your EA (v104). I have the result for today and it seems to be identical to your: Friday: 44 pips Compliments! Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #595 ---
v106 first on ibfx, then v104 on fxdd:

--- 帖子 #596 ---
v106 backtest first 1/2/09 to 2/27/09. (100pip stops need to be combatted by better exits, maybe slightly better entries, and thus the 100pip hardstop can come down a bit. Tweaks to all three aspects may get us there in my humble opinion.) It managed to hold on to the account, but had it been live trading I would have bailed when I started seeing the 100pip stops coming hard and fast, and thus would have stopped it at loss rather than letting it try to regain, which it did, but not by the amount we want to ultimately see. Of course all the above assumes fully automatic, which Siobi has said not to do, but close when in profit - or when you see that it's going against you hard.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Can't backtest v104 at the moment, so if anyone can do that it would be great. Thanks everyone!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi Dan, the back test result for v104 from 1Feb to 27Feb with original setting (ibfx). sl 100, tp 150, ts 25 Gross profit = 209pips Gross loss = 149pips net profit = 60pips Probably need to fine tune the setting in order to get the best result. It hit the SL 100pips once so the overall profit is limited.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Here are results trading ver.106 from19 feb to 27 feb on Admiral Markets demo account.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
And here are backtests v104 and v106 on history data last year with defoult setting. Regards Peter.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Thanks for the words and encouraging performance. Now also on my end! FXDD: v104 = 3 trades and up $30 (.1 =$1 lots) v106 = 1 trade and up $3 Now in 3 v106 trades = $+20.50 and moving poz. Sweet, ...and with thanks (from rainy N. California), Ron

Monday: -11pip

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Monday = -11 pip Tuesday =+16 pip as of now.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Thanks for this. It looks great.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
guys, seems like V104 is making profit, thenI think it is worth for me to continue fine tune on it. fine tune area: checking 1M ADX to ensure the entry point is more accurate. trading time : 0~ 8 closing time: 11

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thanks Siobi, and everyone else for all the input!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
I'm sick.... MC... sorry guys...

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Take care and speed recovery....

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Monday = -11 pip Tuesday =+16 pip Wednesday = 0 pip Thursday = 8 pip

--- 帖子 #610 ---
hello siobi, hello guys, today ive got some bad news. v106 hit the hard stop -100p twice. all the profit is gone. strange thing is, v106 took two similar trades in a short time between each other ,so the loss was doubled. look at screenshot (trades on 2009.03.04 at 11.15 and 12.00) @ siobi, can you implement a hard stop loss that can be changed by parameter in the ea settings? i think that would be great.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Same thing happen to me Tex. 2, v106 trades -100 each.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi guys, I do not have FULL test result from V106. I'm doing Full test on V104. later will look into it....

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi all. Yes, as the backtests verify, large stoploss will eventually kill profits if not account eventually. Same results here. ....We're getting closer I think though! As a side note, please everyone also visit mtupper's super simple system thread which inspired me to manual trade the system according to the rules I shared on page 7 of that thread. Absolutely excellent results thus far, but be forewarned that I only go for 2 pips per trade - never thought that I could be so excited about a two pip trade, but they come so frequently and consistently, that I can't help it!... BUT ... had I trailed the price on most trades, my results would have been AMAZINGLY SPECTACULAR - so as to try to simulate a very simple ea - that I think someone should code. Hint. Hint!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
dan, post the link...

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Here it is guys: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=118843 And I also mixed it with some aspects of this link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=94006 Now just have to find the best times to trade. Not all times are good, that's for sure. Siobi you must be incredibly busy, but are you trading any specific template manually with very good results at the moment? I find that whatever shorter term system I study adds to my understanding of priceaction and it's quirks. Some of those quirks we may capitalize on!!! See a pattern you recognize, and pull the trigger. Didn't used to be that way. No substitute for good old fashioned screen time though. ...Still not ready for the stress of live yet though.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
dan, yes indeed I'm damn bz and just fall sick recently.... getting better today... I'm now trade in live with tiny mini acct... with 0.1 lot... I'm trading using V104 EA fully auto start from today... FYI, scalping is heavily based on price action and big player.. Virus system is a good example... trading in higher timeframe requires good indicator... V104 is now trade on higher timeframe thus heavily depanding on indicator to make the move.... the link you posted is an interesting system.... can u summerised the indicators over there so I can save lots of my time...

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi Siobi. It's 3:50 AM here in Florida, but am glad I woke up enough to reply real quick and take some screenshots - pictures speak thousand words. Will post as full an explaination later so as to devote my full time and faculties, as trading in a profitable manner deserves nothing less. ....Not that I'm always trading profitably, but from my losses I usually learn more than from my wins. PS: To better synchronize our waking hrs., you should move here to FL as maybe in a few more months you can buy a very nice house with pool and all for $10,000 US. ....Why am I laughing, ...I may lose mine very soon!!!

--- 帖子 #618 ---
hello dan, do you have pm activated ? - i sent you one today in the morning. ---------- siobi - whats your plan for the future ? do you improve v104 and let v106 die or will you improve both of them ?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Ok, was going to ramble on and on with maybe 6 or more different screenshots and have everyone's eyes roll up in their heads and nod off,...... BUT: notice sequence of events of my last trade (first trade this morning since last night) and everything should be illuminated my fellow future successful traders; Oh, and like the trade below, let's all try to remember that even if one day we can have $billions - like every single Walton family member (18 billion a piece ) - we should be happy with the few $millions that we have and help others less fortunate! Edit: Hi Tex. Will check and activate my friend. ...Hey, I like the way that sounded: Will check and activate - trade activated!

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Oh, man!!!!!!!! I owe Hans, Jeff, and Tex apologies for not checking my pm's! Where's the popup that tells me " you've got pm's "? LOL PS: For now please concentrate on the signals given by the template I'm going to post, rather than going for the 2 pip strategy I posted just a few posts ago. It works, but there needs to be "volume" - not really fx volume but your broker volume I guess. Anyway, that's only one facet of the system, and only considerable screen time will make that, and more apparent. Will now concentrate on the "and more" part - more pips? ,...yes pips !!! I'm going to get my template and indicators together and post soon.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
.....Oh, yea the template.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Thanks to Siobi, mtuppers, kino, wahnone, and everyone else on this thread and others that have contributed! This is just a rough template, so I'm sure it will be improved, but at this early stage I believe it has awsome potential. At least for dummies like me. (FX for Dummies) Oh and remember that supersignals repaints (rides the price like a pogo stick) so be careful and wait for confirmation that it's a legit " pre-signal "!!! ....I gotta take my own advice there, boy!!!

--- 帖子 #623 ---
okay dan, thanks for the upload. now for the rules, i can't find the post where you defined them again . can u link it or post the rules again please ? many thanks, tex

--- 帖子 #624 ---
The rules are basically as mtuppers specified, with my own quirky little twists, which are NOT necessarily any better, but: For me; 1) look at 50 ema or equivalent to get direction picture (maybe compare with other timeframes for extra confirm.) 2) get super signal alert (careful it jumps around as if on crack) Also check mtuppers thread for alternate indicator posted toward the end of thread. I haven't compared yet. 3) next bar or two, get stochastic cross alert - or at very least dinapoli stoch bounce as per my last $160 trade (there , there was no actual stoch cross arrow on chart) - and I entered too early against the rules anyway anticipating a reversal even before confirmation which cost me pips. 4) signal line changes color (this I guess may happen before #3 above, or at same time, or after) but it would be most wise if one waited for the current signal line color bar to close, as it can change it's mind. 4A) *Maybe optional*: 5 and 8 ema's cross as per wahnone's system (link in above post) 5) If going with trend, maybe wait for next super signal alert in opposite direction followed by #2 and or also #3 above. For me I take scraps from the table and scurry away, but letting winners ride may be better strategy. If impatient like me and going against trend (50 ema or equivalent) go for very small gains if any. I'm certain these "rules" of mine can be improved upon, but I think an ea should be coded, because I see this as really working very well. As I stated, for now let's concentrate on this aspect of this system rather than the super signal repaint (price overshoot when markets moving) 2 pip system I mentioned before. Below trade should go in the textbook (Fx for Dummies). Wish I had taken it live!!! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Ok, I'm just the crazy idea man, so someone else will have to verify, but it seems that while I was writing and daydreaming of keeping my humble house after all, there was another nice trade - or three if not adhereing to the 50 ema too strictly: And all this only on the 1m? Imagine the 5 or 15m! It should work on any timeframe, just an adjustment of pip value, drawdown, take profit, and stoploss. It seems very robust to say the least!!!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Another bad trade! Hehehe. (Didn't follow the rules.) I hate drawdown!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DID I MENTION I HATE DRAWDOWN??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
...And cool sound effects too!!!! I love that "tweet ding" or whatever that supersignals alert is!! .........Alright, ............I'm ok now. Just some stress relief!

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I know, I know, it repaints like mad, and makes the past look like pure heaven!...and the present position you just took, like pure hell! But don't let that scare you away! Seriously! Just wait for confirmation and look at trend, or lack therof and trade accordingly. ...Now if only I could do that consistently! Edit: Like right now when market is consolidating (dying) especially as compared with before when you could do no wrong, don't trade this. You'll get a sideways signal line color change, and then it will change color again right away. Next thing you know, you are hedged because you entered a dead or dying market. ...Like I just did. And do not trade late Friday. ...Oh,... wait it's late Friday. LOL

--- 帖子 #629 ---
dan, i will try out the system on monday when markets start again. will post results with screens then. i wish u a wonderful weekend over there in florida

--- 帖子 #630 ---
I'll improve V104...V104 friday resulted +150 pip...!!!!!! tremendous result!!!

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thanks tex! I think you will enjoy it once you get the feel for it. And thanks Siobi for reworking v104. In my humble opinion, we need to get the stoploss as small as possible and get our entries as good as possible. Appropriate trailing stops will take care of the rest I believe. As far as entries go, at times when there are alot of market players, I believe the system mtuppers came up with will get us into trades at the optimum time, regardless of timeframe, and regardless of exact rules whether his, my current ones on post #624, or any improvement thereof . If an undisciplined and stubborn trader like myself can have a "eureka" moment with this system, then I truly believe anyone here in this thread WILL have success with it, whether it's alongside or integrated in one of Siobi's ea's, which in and of themselves are already pretty impressive. ....But we must all aim for as close to perfection as possible, as I am NOT a gambler! If traded at the right time, I currently believe that system will get us in at the peaks and valleys of the cycles and the rest is up to a trailing stop as per Siobi's ea's. Equally as important I believe is drastically lowering the stoploss, since once hit, it will take back too much profit. The obvious problem has been once you lower the hard stoploss, it gets hit more often. That's where entry optimization comes in, allowing for a more seldom hit stoploss. It's always a balancing act, but with a very robust and accurate entry method, everything else should theoretically fall into place afterwards. PS: With mtuppers entry, an alternate exit from the stated trailing stop may be an opposite super signal and signal line color change/5 and 8 EMA cross from wahnone's system - ( or equivalent trend is over/new trend coming signal ) Oh, and one more thing, for those that downloaded my last template (FINAL3), although the template is named final1m, please take Siobi's general advice and use it on the 5m or up timeframes. It has worked well for me on the 1m also, but go for small pips on that timeframe. Also note that if trading the 1m I also have the 5m and 15m to it's right for a more general feel of where price is going. That said, it should work well on the 15m. Testing by as many of us as possible will get us profitable in fairly short order, I believe. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Below is a chart I posted earlier, but is what we are always looking for. Notice trade was taken on the 1m, but that notwithstanding, it is the foundation of what we look for on any timeframe. Look at every indicator, but especially those in this sequence: 1)we get supersignals and stoch cross indicators at bottom and on top of each other (they don't have to come at the same time, but you should get supersignals, and then stoch cross arrow within one or two bars thereafter) 2)signal line is still down (red) so we wait for it to change to blue, but we note that 50 EMA (orange) is generally up 3)we have time, so we optionally check to see where stoch rsi and dinapoli stoch is at in bottom indi. window (they are down and starting to head up) 4)we get signal line color change to blue, but we may want to wait for bar to close to make sure signal line doesn't change it's mind 5)signal line color closed blue, so we either enter long now, or optionally wait for 5 and 8 ema cross as a further confirmation. We get our 6+pips in minutes and with almost no drawdown whatsoever. (Notice I didn't have an optimal trade, but who's complaining under these conditions) With my erratic trading personality, I need an automated system that looks for just these conditions on different timeframes (with adjusted take profit and stoploss levels of course) and different currencies, as this method would work across the board in my opinion. Also note at least one other trading opportunity that existed before this trade I took, but that one would have gone against the 50 EMA, but it wasn't sharply up so can almost be considered semi-sideways (ranging nicely) Any and all comments, additions, and modifications are always welcomed by me. Happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I believe that this method can best be traded when there are many market participants (tick volume I think) - which is not actual fx market volume which I don't think can be known, but that specific broker tick volume, which should give an "idea" of what's going on. What else is new, right? Dead markets will not give strong signals and strong reversals - or trends for that matter. Big news excluded obviously, as most of us stay out then. At this early stage, I believe that as long there is action in the market, this method will work with strong ranges and trends - as long as we know how to read the indicators under these differing conditions. To that end, and on that subject the following is quite interesting (post #18 of the following thread): (Although I'm no coder, I think if possible any ea should have that rule also coded in as an additional filter, or perhaps in the case of the method I posted above as an alternate and/or addition to a timefilter, by simply staying out when tick volume data is below a certain level.) Based on my short but positive experience with this system, I always have "volume" up on my chart, and also based on actual priceaction, I would stay out of a dead market. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=154339&amp;page=2

--- 帖子 #638 ---
hello dan, i am setting up your template atm. do u have parameters changed in one of the indicators ? which settings do u use for the bollinger bands for example ? thanks, tex Edit : Damn mate - that supersignal indicator is amazing ! i am impressed of the accuracy of the signals. i will try it out a bit now with my own "simple" template. your template is a bit "overwhelming" actually

--- 帖子 #639 ---
LOL, tex. I'm on desktop, will post further on my laptop.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
LOL. Just make believe you are a helicopter pilot in training, looking at all those quages. Actually, the super signals will jump up and down every time there is a new high or low, so by itself it's more than useless, it's downright dangerous . As for the bollingers, I use 1m, 5m, 15m, and sometimes 30m to get a read of where price's path of least resistance may be. A lot of work for getting more than a handful # of pips per "good" signal, but I'm no coder so it is what it is. Default is fine, so it you see price approaching upper bollinger on 1m and 5m, for example, and indicators are agreeing, you know most likely it's good for a few pips untill it either touches or exceeds bollinger on at least the lower timeframe. Screen time with this template or any other worthwile one will take your trading to the next level. Only question will be: Is the next level enough to make you consistently profitable? (EVERYTHING in this universe is relative.) For me, with my erratic personality, the answer is unfortunately no, not consistently. I will give up my winnings with some dumb ass move that I don't kill immediately, and I don't have the patience to take every single legitimate signal on the 5m or 15m for just 5 pips or whatever every single time like an ea would do. (With a set stoploss of maybe 2 or 3 times the TP - which in my opinion would still be more than profitable.) Now, ...super signals is only an audible presignal for me to stop watching my Ufo Hunters or ultimate fighting - or whatever and start paying attention to the chart. Usually when you get the further confirmations stated in my pervious posts, you can usually take anywhere from 2-10 pips per "legitimate" signal/confirmation, depending on tiemframe. ...So, knowing that almost every single "legitimate and logical" signal combination can net you a certain small # of pips, makes the automation of this unconventional system quite attractive in my less than conventional mind. ....Yes, I'm out there, so do not blindly follow my methods, especially given v104's recent results, numerous backtests notwithstanding. ...Actually Siobi stated that he's going to improve v104, so his results may be with his improved version. (Even though backtests are not the end all be all, they must be given some credence.) ....Maybe he coded in an auto update to the latest and greatest version! ...Because at this rate, we won't need to trade manually!!! We WILL need to send him a small percentage of our live winnings though! (1-10% of account size on a progressive scale ) That would be the least we can do if indeed he comes up with a gem!!!

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I also have fxdd. where is the correct tpl and indi downloads to run this? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #642 ---
found it in 197, thanks.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hello stifland. Are we looking at the same template from post #197?:

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Yes, for simplicity's sake, tex take a look at the actual v104 manual template on the 30m, which looks like it will do everything my helicopter cockpit template will do, only more simply I think. I must have gotten mine lost in the thousand others. LOL

--- 帖子 #645 ---
umm yeah ur right, the supersignal indicator jumps with the bars when they go against the first entry signal. damn, i was looking at the past entry signals and they were everytime on highest and lowest price before the direction changend...now i know why ^^.. but i think i can use the indicator as a first signal that must be confirmed by other indicators like rsi and ema and bollinger just like u are doing in your helicopter training template

--- 帖子 #646 ---
You're too funny!!! My idea is that whatever allows one to make the right decisions from the start most often is what one should stick with. ....Untill a better system comes along. My system is by no means better than anyone else's, (it's based on mtuppers, and a medley of others like Siobi's), so I will adapt to whatever works best no matter who came up with it. Those smoothed heiken ashi bars sure look good, but at first I thought the signal line basically told me the same thing. I will rethink that and more, and maybe add the ss, stoch cross, etc. to the v104 template and see what my synapses come up with. If one is not where he/she wants to be, they need to be openminded and take ideas from wherever they come from. Take or discard, that is one's prerogative. That's where I will stirve to be till my dying day, ego be damned! Bottom line: be nice and if you make much money, help others deserving but less fortunate. Now let's make some money! ...Consistently!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I believe Siobi should post the exact template his latest v104 ea is based on, and let us feel our way around it. Personally, I would be honored to have a template that gave optimum signals (relative to all other systems) that can be traded manually. I'm not lazy, just hesitant to trade anything with less than an 80% success ratio. I would even pay for it! ..................Hell, I paid for fapturbo! (Ever see those draw downs??!!)

--- 帖子 #648 ---
actually no Dan, Looks like I have all the indis and the expert but not the tpl? Was that on the post? Thanks

--- 帖子 #649 ---
No I don't remember a v104 "template" per say. ...But in Siobi's defence, he has a family, job, etc. etc. and his efforts have been beyond exemplary thus far! If anything, it's been me that has set him back slightly from his initial endeavors! He IS more spiritual (not to mention more intelligent than myself), and I DO NOT want to influence him otherwise!

Hi all, to clarify. scalping for 1M in live is very difficult and returning small profit... the broker in LIVE can always play with the price on the hihg and low. I tried V104 in 1M, 5M, 15M and 30M. it returning very outstanding result in 30M. I'm now trade in live. yesterday V104 return 13pip and today I stop manually on 4pip. tomorrow I'll let it run and target for 20 pip per day!!!

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Im having problem running the EA, I have loaded the new template for 30 mins timeframe and the new EA but in backtest it dosent open any trades. What am i doing wrong ? thanks

--- 帖子 #657 ---
2 trade taken: 1) +4pip 2) +20pip TP set to 20 pip, SL 100pip or you may reset it to follow PSAR value Trailing Stop set to 15 pip. trade it for whole day except news hour. I love V104R8!!!!!

--- 帖子 #658 ---
is itrunning on 5 digit platform? if yes, then set the Num_Of_Digit to "True"

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I have put it on True, but still the same problem, dosent make any trade in backtesting, i have loaded it up now in the 30 min chart, but i doubt it will make a trade there either. I have put also the time to trade from 0 to 24

--- 帖子 #660 ---
hm.. do you have any error message in your Exprt/journal tab? remember to put also the Close hour to more than 24... let say 30.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Unfortunetly i dont get any error message : Only that it loads the indicators

--- 帖子 #662 ---
ah comeon, no news is good news... no error is fortunate.... It should take trades, let it run in your DEMO acct.. it works well in IBFX,FXDD as well as ALpari at the moment.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Im using it on Alpari UK

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I got 16 pips out of that one running auto. 2 trades today (3-10) +13, +16. Siobi is this the same ea from a couple weeks ago? Testing on FXDD.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
yes, same EA. I ust change my TS to 15 pip and TP to 20 pip to fulfill my daily target of 20 pip. I'm now trading in LIVE... IBFX mini acct

--- 帖子 #666 ---
What about Hour setting? Mine has start at 0 and 8 for End. Does this mean it will only trade 8 hours based on this? I changed close to 30 as suggested.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
if you are just testing whether this EA open trade or not, you may follow below setting: 1) hour start = 0, end = 24, close = 30 if you are using it for DEMO optimised setting are 1) hour start = 0, end = 8, close = 11 if u r trade for LIVe (like me) 1) hour start = 0, end = 24, close =30 2) stop this EA during news time. 3) tp=20, TS=15, SL=100. 4)manual close if it is totally out of trend (never face this before after trading live untill this post).

Just for testing I put this EA on gbp/usd, usd/chf and usd/jpy (majors) this morning trading 24 hrs a day with all the rest on default. Have not closed anything yet but it's +150 so there will be good profit here. Ea just closed all trades with +102. Eur/usd is still at your defaults and a constant winner. Will keep you informed.

IBFX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #679 ---
some of it I took manual exit....

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I had the chart zoomed way out, and it showed some trades that the older v104 made, then I installed v104r8 (actually inside the ea properties it says v104r7), and I believe some if not all trades were made with the older version. Siobi, are you using v104r7 or v104r8 in your live trading? Edit: Ok, I see it is v104r8 in your screenshot. Any differences between the two, as I'd like to go back live too very soon? Happy pipping everyone!!!

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Yeah, mine says v 1.04R7 Feb 22 on screen, but 1.04 R8 Mar 3 in properties. Last trade I show in hindsight is Buy on Mar 6th when market opened, no trades since.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
I'm using version R8 in live trading R7 and R8 different is entering condition, R8 is based on ADX 5M and 15M R7 is based on ADX 1M and 5M PS: I had cross check and found that the comment in R8 still showing R7... I had only change the remark to R8...so to ensure you are using R8, check the remark setting in the EA... sorry about that, I'll repost once I get back home... now I'm working at office.. my live trade is at home running on my NB... I left it at home and login from office to see my trade, but I can't remote login to my NB...

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Thanks Siobi! I've got a good feeling about all this!!! I think we'll all be in profit soon!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Do wee need to close up this thread and re-open another trade let say hm... FX-bounce system for 30M...? because we had change our system from 1M to 30M... and this thread is so messy..... how?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
yes, it is good idea to do that

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Vote to open new Thread = 1 Vote NOT to open new thread = 0

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Yes, especially with all my different templates that were not really related to the original system. The new thread should be about the ea and different settings etc. (I will say that the latest template I posted, although looking messy at first, is consistently making demo pips almost every time I get a good signal.)

Because it would be nice since it is different. Also maybe a discussion more on How it works. EA's are great, but I always want to know logic. Teach a man to fish....... Then we can possibly expand if so, although I can't code, only trade

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Before we all leave, check this out. (Could have taken many more trades, but doing a few different things at once) 2 pips at a time, but quick in and out on the 1m. Will also work for more pips on the upper timeframes, just don't have the patience to wait too long for good signals. Automation should come for this, since if I can do it, IT WORKS!

I will have to be very very very careful when summer comes here in Florida. Almost daily my power will go out momentarily when storms come. I should do all my trading very soon!!!

Could have had more but not greedy: 4 more pips: Siobi, this will have to be your next project when you get the time! Two fantastic ea's????

--- 帖子 #700 ---
hm.. perhaps you can simplify it with all the conditions... it is too messy and hard to follow the conditions... even me loss track on it...

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I'll e-mail or pm you parameters when I have confirmed I didn't just get lucky with some sympathetic priceaction. At this point I can say that this is DEFINITELY a bounce system and not so good in trends without overcomplicating ea rules. Thank you my friend, and thanks for v104. Spectacular results thus far!!!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
hello dan, i am having troubles with the entry rules too. correct me if i am wrong please. i pull the trigger and go for the two pips when : the supersignal indicator dings the first time, and then i go in the opposite direction ? for example price is at 1.2750 an the bell rings for a short signal, the i go long assuming the price wont change direction immediately and take the two pips with a buy. thats how i understand your posting of the rules. am i right with that ? tex

--- 帖子 #703 ---
That will work too, but the market really has to be popping. Literally popping, since you want to be ready instantly with a buy when FIRST short signal rings, which usually will work when the market is hot and you see price approaching upper or lower bollingers and you are mostly going with the trend. The above has worked for me with a bunch of players in the market, but I only used that strategy for a very limited time. It's taking advantage of the ss "premature" signal to go opposite, but at some point it will actually be correct. Just a matter of when, within 2 pips or 20 pips? So we wait for other indicators as per below, using the opposite strategy of actually waiting for ss to actually turn legit. My last trades posted go according to the rules I stated: 1)SS rings - it may continue to ring many times, but we do the following 2)we wait for confirmation from stoch cross arrow 3)color line changes color confirming retrace 4)we are not entering against a strong trend 5)enter and exit depending on timeframe, trend, further signals in opposite direction, or when you just made your desired pips The other indicators may give you added confirmation. Of course it's all so easy on DEMO! Let me know if you have further questions, as I am horrible at explaining what goes on in my crazy head. ...Good crazy though!!! Salvador Daliesque perhaps. All the best!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
EA104 doesn't seem to be taking trades in Strategy Tester. Any thoughts? My other EA's will.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Even though we all know backtesting is not all it's cracked up to be, we will have to run it through the paces though. So anyone with a really fast computer may want to do that on a more extended timeframe and then maybe optimize it if possible.

--- 帖子 #706 ---

hello folks, hello dan my fellow piphunter i am busy in evolving my own little scalping system at the moment. first trades show good results but i am still far away from perfection. the system uses a bunch of ema's just like the rainbow scalping system does but much less ema's and some indicators ive got from siobi and you i will post an overview of the system soon. i hope i can explain it properly because my english isnt that good .. i will post it in this threat, perhaps i'll open a new thread later when the system gets better. wish u many pips ! tex

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Very much looking forward to it tex!!

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Just for kicks, I entered only hedged trades (all of the ones shown below) with a trail stop, no tp and any which way, not concerned with where I thought market was going: Arbitrarily entered every trade with both a buy and sell at the same time, and let one get stopped out for profit or at worst $0 and closing the other when in overall profit. Not sure but seems to work, since when all is added up it comes to $630 positive. I'm sure it will be even more interesting when the market picks up and we have stronger moves. Under best conditions; looking for market to shoot up or down, take good pips from trailing stop, and then retrace back as far as possible to close second half of buy/sell trade, perhaps for a loss, but overall profit from the sum of first half + second half of trade. ....If that makes any sense. Please someone try it when the market is moving and tell me what you think. (Using swiss army trailing stop ea with no tp, break even at 8, break even slide 2, trailing stop 6, since using relatively high lots. Or maybe it's just plain dumb and I got lucky! ...But hey it was interesting!

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Another $100 but it could have been $150 had I grabbed the mouse quicker! (Difference between the $250 sell and -$150 buy placed at the same time.) I must say that at least at this early stage it seems that in this way the market dictates direction, and you only have to worry about the exit of the second half of the trade if you don't think it will retrace enough to get to the original entry price or even past for a second half profit. Nah! Just lucky again!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
hahaha, this thread still active huh....

--- 帖子 #715 ---
where can i get that swiss army trailing stop ea dan ? yeah siobi, we keep your thread alive here

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Here you go bud:

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Was able to gain approx. $900 from the little experiment, under less than ideal conditions. Even so, don't know how feasible it is. Just know that this swiss army ea is pretty good if you manual trade and need automatic trade managing. Happy pipping!

--- 帖子 #718 ---
dan, u doing this all by hedges? then using swiss army to manage it? impressed....

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Siobi, I was just fooling around, and my antics should not in any way derail you in making an awsome ea that is ultimately consistent in making a consistent profit. I must say that I have patents to my name, but I have made not a dime from such, therefore I am not one to be consulted beyond my actual limited expertise. In other words; do your thing my friend, and we'll comment on the results. ....So far so good!!!!!!! ....With v104!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Said differently, your v104 makes the manual trading above completely obsolete so far!

--- 帖子 #720 ---
dan, I'll send u V104R9 with 2 additional setting. 1) MA_CHECK 2) slope Check tested to have MA_CHECK, it reduce alot of bad trade but also good trade.. to have only slope check returns more trade taken but more false alarm... nothing is perfect right? I think i'll turn off MA Check and turn on Slope check for my live acct ... bless me....

Notice how all the down move retraces look on the bottom indicator. Now notice how the change in direction (trend) looks on the indicators especially the bb bands bar stop indi. (4th from the bottom). Pretty interesting at this early stage!! Let's all mind meld - like Spock - and put together a profitable system!!!

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Good for at least 18 pips at this moment: ...But also notice rsi is overheated and ready for a retrace, so bailing with 18 or so and waiting to get back in on the retrace, as long as bb band stop bar is still blue. ...I guess. LOL PS: The blue rsi you see at the bottom of the topmost indicator is the 60m rsi, so the other rsi's (5 and 14 - I also believe that the 5rsi will bounce off the 14rsi saying retraces only) will retrace I believe and come down to join the 60m rsi. We shall see if my prediction is spot on or way the f off, especially since it's my first day with this template. To be continued........

Traded the nonlagdots. Had two bonehead trades, but managed to make up for them. If I can do it an ea should be twice as good!!! Next I have to work on staying in a strong trend when the opportunity presents itself, and closing losers sooner. (If it's not going my way from the start, it's a mistake .) Gotta keep telling myself that, and writing it down in this post may help me help myself. ...Let's not even talk about MM! ...But hey, look Mom, no drawdown. Well, very little anyway.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hi Dan! Are you playing with a new old EA? Isakas Kuskus EA? Is this why you made profit?!? Manuel

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi Manuel. No, that was manual trading. The ea has not taken any trades since I applied it to the chart. I just found it yesterday, and will have to find out more info. on the KusKus ea soon. It looks interesting though, at least in trending markets. The manual trading was mainly based off the nonlagdots, but obviously will have to continue the experiment when markets are trending nicely to see if I can ride a wave and make more pips per signal. Regards.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hey!!! Got my first entry with v1.21!!! Nice....!!! Oh hell, if it keeps making entries like below, I'll just babysit each new entry and I'm good to go. Probably just luck though. Damn, 8 pips with no drawdown whatsoever. The way I've been trading manually, I'd be up $400 right now!!!

would you post your manual trading setup with indi's please as it is currently Dan thanks Brian

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Brian, sorry for the late reply. I have since moved on to maybe 100 other combinations of indicators and templates , and have realized that all of them are pointing to the very same thing from many different angles. From whatever angle you look at it through the use of indicators though, you/we are looking at " priceaction ". Nothing more, nothing less. I've realized that like a new language, the market cannot be learned through the indiscriminate use of indicators alone, and screentime is the most important thing. ...Well at least after the fact that you can't teach an old dog new tricks. ...Wish I had started this when I was a teen. Right now I use plain old bollinger bands,keltner channels, candlesticks, and heiken ashi smoothed, and I now try to trade what i see not what I think I will see. (I now try to go with the " flo ".) If it's consolidating, you will see the keltner channels very close to the bollingers - we want to see them spread, and the Damiani volatmeter tells us the same thing in essence - and obviously we do not trade there. We wait for a fairly strong breakout from the squeezed bands and we take trade in the direction of the heiken ashi bars just like the smart gazelle that runs with the rest of the herd and not in the mouth of the chasing cheetah. Remember that I'm no pro, and being successful in my demos doesn't mean I have the demeanor to get back in the market live. Maybe soon I hope, with the help of the many good people here though. PS : I do like the fx prime indicator, and the ma cci rsi (included below) in place of the middle (20 MA) bollinger band. Also I find the kino indicator and the signal bars helpful when most or all are the same color. ...At least psychologically. Cheers!

Hi everyone! Had some difficulties, but I hope to be back more often. Been hopping from indicator to indicator, template to template, so for those that have asked for those, I apologize for not reading my pm's till a few days ago. The bad news is that I myself cannot keep track of the litterally hundreds of indicarors and templates I've been through - also one of my computers let go - but the good news is that it hasn't been a complete waste of time, as it has taught me much about this market, even though more than once I have asked myself "What the hell did I do to make those positive pips at that time???!!!" (Even if positive pips came on demo while negative ones came live, LOL!) Thanks to all my freinds here that have had patience with less experienced members like myself! Will post some interesting charts soon. ...At least I think they're interesting. ...........If there's still anyone up in here.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Kino, if you make it back here I would be glad to dig out that one, but I honestly believe that you could do a hell of alot better with whatever setup you're using now. In any case, I wouldn't put a chart up without your kino multi indicator 3 lite. I love it. Thanks to you and everyone else here. PS: Maybe another compliment to the above indicator; Thanks to the coder of that one too.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi golden1. I have since moved on, and do not want - unless you still want it - to post something that didn't cut it, even for me, lol. Good is never good enough, and even if it's good for my unorthodox style, it's probably bad for most everyone else. I now mostly use priceaction with a few indicators that affirm trend and a decent entry according to that trend. Basically the method from a few posts back. (Bollinger bands, that colored 20 ma I posted instead of middle bol. band, kino's multiindicator, gmac2, and of course candlesticks.) I also like some kind of arrows - cci, ema cross, etc. - for entries into a trend. If it's trending decently, a nonperfect entry is ok as long as you go with the flow. Just helps me get on board a moving train so to speak. ...As long as you don't get onboard the moving train as it's pulling into your destination station, or worse a train going the other way. Good trading everyone.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
If anyone is still around, I would like to have a kind person here make an indicator that tells us when two or three timeframes MA CCI RSI's (in this case 20 period 1m and 5m) turn to the same color - red or green and perhaps yellow from red or green (user adjustable if possible). Then we only check to see angle of them to be going up or down and voila, we take trade. If coincident angles - up or down, no sideways - can also be part of the indicator, all the better. ...When they coincide, we would get signal alert and go through the above check, perhaps checking to see if we have coincident support/resistance also. Perhaps there's something similar out there already, but in any case I'll also maybe start a thread on this if others believe it to be worthwile. Thanks everyone!

Oh, and almost forgot, if we get divergence against above signals, do not take trade, if divergence with our trend direction, by all means do take trade. If that can also make it into the indicator or perhaps even ea, ....well then I think we are on to something. .........What do I know though!
