First off, all kudos and respect goes to 'Bobi' of Abonacci fame, who is a genius and legend in my eyes, much (if not most) of this system is derived from his studies and observations. I won't go into it here, but you can read about his work here . Second, hats of to ubenders - who appears to have put 2 and 2 together and made 4 (which is quite a feat in this business). He may well have discovered a missing link for those of us who have been trading the Abonacci way. So some rules (as it seems most threads need them). 1. Be respectful That's about it - but I might add to that if it seems necessary. So to the system. First let me say this is a work in progress, but based on proven and profitable systems. One reason for the thread is to refine it. BUT that does not mean refining by throwing every indicator you can imagine at it - the beauty of this system is the simplicity. It is more refining through observation we're looking for. Charts We only need two indicators 1. Abonacci indicator 2. Murrey Math (MM) indicator Nothing else is needed. Really. No REALLY. Chart setup (this is the most complicated bit, but once done everything is set) 1. Open a chart (timeframe doesn't really matter but I go for 1h or 4hr) 2. Apply template below. 3. Open Murrey Math indcator and change to the following. 'P' to '256' and 'MMPeriod' to '1440' Attached Image (click to enlarge) 4. Open Abonacci Template For pairs with price format x.xxxxx 'Length' 122 (1h TF trading) or 244 (4h TF trading) or 488 (Daily TF trading) For pairs with price format xx.xxxx or xxx.xxx (usually yen pairs) change 'Length' to 156 (30m/1h TF trading) or 312 (4h TF trading) or 625 (Daily TF trading) and 5. Copy one of the Murrey Math levels (preferably the Support/Resistance Pivot Point level (blue)) into the 'Baseline box' Attached Image (click to enlarge) 6. Your abonacci 100% levels should now line up with the MM levels. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trading Option 1. Long Trade - Price comes from 76.4% level rises above 0%/100% into the phase above. Enter long when price breaks the 23.6%. Take Profit is the 76.4% level. Short Trade - Price comes from 23.6% level drops Below 0%/100% into the phase below. Enter short when price breaks the 76.4%. Take Profit is the 23.6% level. You may want to move SL to BE and/or take a 1/3 off when price reaches 50%, and/or take another 1/3 off when price reaches 61.8% (long)/23.6% (short) You will see that what we are aiming to do is take a slice out of the action when price is moving between levels. Stop Loss I suggest either 10 pips below (longs) or above (shorts) the 100% level or close and reverse your position at the 76.4% level in the phase below (longs), 23.6% level (shorts). As with all systems, there will be losses. So the importance of finding the right money management to fit your trading style and risk tolerance cannot be over emphasised. Examples Attached Image (click to enlarge) Option 2 Coming soon Sizes and baselines for pairs (bolded numbers are a 1:1 fit. ie 1 phase of abonacci fits the exact distance between 2 Murrey Math levels) GBP/USD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.5625 GBP/JPY Size - 156, 312 or 625 Baseline - 150 GBP/AUD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline 1.95313 EUR/USD Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.31836 EUR/AUD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.36719 USD/CHF Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 0.92773 USD/JPY Size - 156, 312 or 625 Baseline - 87.5 EUR/JPY Size - 156, 312 or 625 Baseline - 125 AUD/NZD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline - 0.97656 USD/CAD Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.02539 AUD/USD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline - 0.97656 AUD/JPY Size - 156, 312 or 625 Baseline - 87.5 EUR/GBP Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 0.83008 NZD/USD Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 0.83008 GBP/CHF Size - 122 , 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.46484 NZD/JPY Size - 156, 312 or 625 Baseline - 87.5 EUR/CAD Size - 122, 244 or 488 Baseline - 1.36719 XAU/USD Size - 3125 , 6250 Baseline - 1500.00 Another approach worth exploring is calculating using a bigger size template (doesn’t matter how big as long as it matches the MM levels) and then build multiple entries (equity millipede) for swing trading. As the thread develops (hopefully), I will add links or text from posts where members contribute refinements and developments.

Really good work Hollowhead - you know I will follow with great interest. I think Ubender was very observent in letting us know about the similarities in the two systems and how they might be integrated. Two Brits working together - we are in for a treat.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Distant. The Ab Manuel and the Murray Math both go in Indicators and the Pure and Simple in Templates. After you put the template on your chart then drag the Ab Manual on to it and fill in the two fields. Two other charts you can use are GBAU with 122 and 1.83105 and USJP with 156 and 104.688 (I think. They seemed to work okay for me). Bob

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Very interesting, I like fibs very much, but haven't used in this way with mm levels before. Will look at developing here. Cheers

--- 帖子 #5 ---
GBPAUD with 488 phase and 1.7578 baseline.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks for dropping by - it'll be good to have your input.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
interesting thinking..............................................................................

--- 帖子 #8 ---
So, this means multiplications of 122 work - that's the same as other x.xxxxx pairs. Is this a universal truth based on MM math? So if you want to trade more intraday (1hr), you could use 122 or if you are looking for longer term (4h) you would use 488. I guess you could scalp using size 61.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sorry folks, I should have qualified my baseline and length. Those numbers were for a one hour chart.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
For XXX.XXX pairs I think multiplications of 625 work and seem to be consistent. 156, 312 and 625 create nice phases to trade.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Yes the size of the intervals or phases depend on the period you set the indicator to, I prefer to use a minimum of 122 pip interval for this type of trading but each to their own and whatever works for you. USDJPY has a 312 pip interval with the indicator set to 256 days.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
It looks like we should post four lots of info when taking about numbers. First chart period, second "P" value for Murray Maths, third base line and fourth size. Otherwise our charts won't line up.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks bobha, user error on my part. lol

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Sounds like a good idea.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I think a variation on the Abonacci T4F rules is worth testing What I'll look at is First establish trend - if long then enter at cross of 23.6% target 76.4%. If it reverses and cross below the 0%/100%, then close (if you haven't already moved stop to BE) and short targeting the 50% of the lower phase. I think will give a near 1:2 RR on the initial trade with fractionally less on the reversal - but it may help if price is becoming choppy.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The numbers for the trade could be 1st Trade - Enter at 23.6% TP 64 pips SL 32 Pips (possible move to BE when 32 pips in profit) Reverse trade Go short at 0% -5 pips TP - 55 pips SL - 32 pips

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Entered Long on AJ - TP at 76.4% line. SL 5 pips below 100% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks for sharing hollowhead ! Took that one on demo this morning: GA 122 pips. Short at 76.4%. Attached Image (click to enlarge) May be useful to look at daily ATR before entering. GA has broke a new zone, but ATR is reached.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Nice one Fbird - thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi hollowhead, great post. Love the strategy! Sound and simple! Want to make sure I get this right. The intervals are the ranges between the fib numbers (38.2, 50, 61.8, 76.4) I assume. The phase is the total range from high to low, correct? Do you only use yearly levels or do you also use daily and weekly levels for phase totals and use the same exact strategy on the shorter time frames? Last question, not sure where the murry math comes into play. Using just the basic concept seems fine without any added tools. Maybe you can give me some clearification on that. Great job!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This is an example using the ES S+P futures. These are from yesterdays levels. Another quick question. If a target or stop is not hit within todays trading I assume I reset the levels and manage the trade on the new levels (High/Low) that will be created today. Is that right?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi What is size and baseline for Eur/Usd Pair?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
We are using Abonacci rules to trade Murrey Math phases/intervals. The Abonacci template is used with a Murrey Math level to create phases or intervals and we trade it using Bobis rules.

Hi tmoney - welcome to the thread. If we go back to beginning, among other things Bobi Abonacci discovered that the markets are not random and move within phases - not a new revelation in itself, repeating patterns etc. But he also discoverd what appears to be a universal formula showing where the market would move to within these phases - he calls them 'pre-determined support and resistance'. The calculation is done using the previous year's high, low and close. But , he is unable to share the formula for the calculation as it is now the property of his company. He has established 42 templates of different sizes and it is very accurate and complicated. The calculation his formula does provides a final number (price) and that is the 'baseline' for that pair (and what is entered into the abonacci indicator). When the baseline and 'template size' (103, 220, 680, 965 etc) is entered into the calculator you have levels divided up by fib ranges. For each template he has rules for trading those fibs. He has been good enough to share the baselines for a few pairs and for a handful of different 'templates'. While many of us have been able to make good profits with those, I and others have been aware that the future for us is limited and wholly dependent on Bobi to provide the baselines each year - so an opportunity to find another way to trade his system on a wider variety of pairs and for many years to be is something to pursue. ubender, presenter the idea of using Murrey Math levels as the baselines - this then gives us phases which we could apply the abonacci fibs and trade using a variation of bobi's rules. So, if you enter into the MM indicator 256 trading days (a year) you can basically get phases for a year and by entering one of the MM levels as a baseline on the abonacci indi you can trade the MM levels. When I refer to a phase I am taking about the 0%-100% fib range, levels are the MM levels. If you take a quick look at the first 15 pages of Bobi's thread that I link to in the first post - it may help give a little more context. I will try and put this all down (explained better). Probably a PDF which I'll put put on the first post. Hope that might clarify a little. Going offline for a while - will be back later.

Thanks

I like the simplicity of this system and will be following with interest. Thanks Hollowhead,

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hollowhead and Unbender this is a job well done this I guess will be the thread for me to follow closely even though I have not understood it fully yet I beginning to feel comfortable with it

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I've updated post 1 with a little more guidelines on how to set the charts up. I hope this is clearer.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hollow, you have a typo in the revised first post. Step 6 I think you mean that these will NOW line up.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Schoolboy error that changed the meaning somewhat . Thanks for letting me know bobha.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you! This helped!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Haven't been on forex factory for several days so I just now discovered your new thread. I am looking forward to experimenting with this new abonacci murray math approach when I have time. Thanks Hollowhead for starting this thread. I know it will be well run as evidenced by your coordination of the abonacci thread. As discussed on the other thread, I have been consistently profitable with the way I trade the 103 abonacci template. This should be fun.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Subscribe.. Need to find out more.. esp. how to determine the P, MMPeriod, lenght and baseline.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Hollowhead, Charts now set up on the 4H TF.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hollowhead. I have taken this trade on Demo. NZDUSD 4H, Price is in an uptrend rising from the phase below through 76.4% then through 100%- 0% of the new phase. Long trade at the 23.6% fib with target of 76.4% fib (0.87312). Move stop to BE at 50%fib (0.86668). Is this OK? Thanks in advance. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
It looks like a good trade to me. It is possibly retesting the 23.6%, so could be resistance turning support.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
How are you coming up with the length settings? I assume it has something to due about the yearly range but I want to make sure I fully understand.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
The length settings is the distance between MM levels. All we are doing is creating abonacci phases between the MM levels. If you set the MM 'P' to be for 256 (a year's trading days), then we have annual levels. As long as the 0%/100% line up with the MM Levels we can trade it. For the pairs I have tested non-yen pairs, the MM levels can be broken up into phase lengths of multiples of 122, 244, 488. For yen pairs the MM levels can be broken up into phase lengths of mutliples of 156, 312, 625. The longer the length, the bigger the phase. So you could break up the 1D MM levels into several smaller abonacci phases. For some who prefer to day trade, this would make sense, (but I think there will have more stop-outs). For those who are happy to sit on a trade for a few days or more, then they would use larger phase lengths and trade the abonacci levels between higher TF MM levels. So we are working on refining rules and MM to trade the phases. We want to spot price behaviour in relation to the levels in abonacci phases and the MM levels.

GBPCAD on 4H TF. This trade fits the criteria of moving through 76.4% and 100% of previous phase and trade taken at 23.6%. Previous resistance here at the 1.8600 level. Target at 76.4% level (1.8740) with BE at 50% (1.8676). Stop 10 pips below the 0%. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello Mr Hollowhead I have followed Your thread from the beginning and I am still trying to figure out how to plot this MM The original if I may say so and please correct me if I misunderstood is: Open Last year chart and plot the MM form the high to the low of the year and then in each of the MM sections plot the FIB starting from the top to the bottom of each sections of the MM. Then is up to the individual to use his own Time frame to trade. Is it right or I got it all wrong? And also what about if one cannot plot the MM, are those number 122,244,488, and the other ones for the yen 156,312,625, doing the same job as the MM and if so from where do You start to plot them on the chart? I think I read somewhere MM has 8 sections so I see You only give 3 numbers Most probably I am making such a mess that will confuse You.... I apologise for that just trying to learn Have a nice day

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi ralfy - this is one of those things that is quite hard to describe in written words. I may try and make a video of setting up the charts - can't promise anything. In the meantime, have you been back to the first post and seen the amended section on setting up the charts I did last night? I have included some images which I think/hope makes it clearer?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
HOLLOWHEAD, The update on first post is very helpful but I still have a question concerning point 4 "4. Open Abonacci Template For pairs with price format x.xxxxx 'Length' 122 (1h TF trading) or 244 (4h TF trading) or 488 (Daily TF trading) For pairs with price format xx.xxxx or xxx.xxx (usually yen pairs) change 'Length' to 156 (30m/1h TF trading) or 312 (4h TF trading) or 625 (Daily TF trading) and" for pairs with x.xxxxx format length is 122 for 1h since x.xxxxx is in 5 decimal places don't you think the length should be 1220 for 1h and pairs with x.xxxx format should have length of 122 for 1h?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I don't think so. My broker has 5 decimal points and length 122 is correct. See pic below Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Hollowhead, Do you know the length for gold and silver which is currently xxxx.xx and xx.xx respectively for H1/H4/D1 TF? Thanks

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Also for USOil... Thanks

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Also for USOil... Thanks. Though presently i use 156

--- 帖子 #48 ---
GC with 62.50 phase and 1375 baseline

--- 帖子 #49 ---
For Gold - I would use Baseline - 1250.00 Daily length - 6250 4h length - 3125 1h length 1562 Silver - I would use Baseline - 21.875 Daily length - 156 4h length - 156 (same as above) 1h length - 78

--- 帖子 #50 ---
My broker uses different price format, but multiplying the length by 10 gives the same output. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Please Hollowhead, How do you derive the length to be used on any pair? I quite understand the baseline very well.. Hoping to read from you.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Generally, The length is the distance in pips between two Murrey Math levels. So say on the daily time frame the distance between two Murrey Maths levels is 488 pips - then that is the length we enter into the Abonacci inidicator.This means an Abonacci phase (0%-100%) is 488 pips. Now if you want more Abonacci phases between the Murrey Math levels, you can enter a length of 244 (488/2= 244). That will give you two Abonacci phases between MM levels on the daily timeframe, if you want even more phases between MM levels you can divide by 4 (488/4=122). All we are doing is dividing the MM levels into abonacci phases. And what I am suggesting is that you might want to use the shorter length if you are looking at a shorter TF on your chart - but its only a suggestion. As with most trading methods - the higher TF (and larger length) will be more reliable - but will take longer to complete.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks soo much.. I got the presentation right. I really appreciate.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Steve - This looks like a way to add abonacci to different currency pairs. The baselines probably would not be exact according to Bobi's private formula but I bet it would be close enough to trade with the simplified rules you have established. We could probably just eliminate the MML after the Abonacci is set up. I am live and trading Abonacci on the pairs Bobi gave us but I am going to give this a whirl with some other pairs on demo that I enjoy trading (GBP/CAD, AUD/CAD, GBP/JPY &amp; EUR/JPY). Thanks again for grabbing the bull by the horns and riding this animal. Tom

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hey Tom - Like you I am still trading Abonacci with Bobi's baselines - but those pairs have driven me mad lately. I am hedged and the ranging is not unlocking anything for me, so at the moment its a waiting game (although FOMC may have got the ball rolling). I also want to play with a few other pairs - and taming 'the beast' would be great. I want to find a way to tip the odds in our favour a little more with this. As with most systems ranging can be a killer, and I want to see how we can limit that as much as possible - but I don't want to cloud the simplicity with a load of indicators/oscillators (although I am partial to a little divergence ). If we can apply Pure &amp; Simple Abonacci to any pair, then we can be more selective and trade the levels/phases when we can see there is momentum and avoid some of the ranging (can't elimiate it all though). There may be something in the MM levels - I don't know enough about them at the moment, but I know there are rules/assumptions relating to the particular MM levels - this MAY give us a little added edge. I am going to do some research and see if there is anything worth backtesting. Great to have you on board here.

Sorry for this post, but how to install these indicators into the mt4 platform? Actually, I have put these indicators into its respective folders but I cannot see it after opening the platform. Thanks

--- 帖子 #59 ---
They both go in the Indicators folder - if you MT4 has upgraded you will need to put them in the Indicators folder that is inside the MQL4 folder. Steve

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hollow, further to your post #52 if anyone is looking at the indices it is a matter of subtracting one MM level from the next and then multiplying by 100. And may I make a suggestion: if you change the MM figures in your template this would cut out one of the steps in the first post. Just makes it a bit easier for everyone. Cheers, Bob

--- 帖子 #61 ---
good one hollow. Just want to know how to use this on gold n silver. i mean the length

--- 帖子 #62 ---
ssaqeel. See post 49

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello Hollowhead, Thank you so much for sharing this. It looks brilliant. Please correct me if i am wrong, what i understand is Abonacci Templates Manual v7-1.1.ex4 draws fib ratios from baselines to number of length and keeps looping it on the chart. The length is the difference pips between two murray lines and murray math indicator draws the lines based on 1440 timeframe with 256 candles(1 trading year) in mind. Am i right?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
HOLLOWHEAD thanks for the comprehensive explanation, I have more questions to ask. Question 1: In post #49 your base line for GOLD is 1250.00. But when I set up my MM indi. the base line I saw was 1375.00 Am I doing it wrongly or what? Question 2: When can we say that a level has been broken? I mean by how many pips?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi - TBH it won't make any difference - If the length is 1250, you could use any of the MM levels as a baseline. All the baseline does is give a starting place for the phases to start and then repeat/loop. You could use 1312.5, 1375, 1250 etc. - notice they are 62.5 pips apart. 1250(the length) divided by 20 is 62.5. If you look at the image on the post you reference you can see all the MM levels - you will see 1375 and 1250. As long as the 0%/100% line up with MM levels, its all good. Great question about what constitutes a break. I don't have hard and fast rules at the moment, it it is probably going to be different depending on whether you are using a 122, 244 or 488 length. I am working on a break is 5 pips (not waiting for candle to close) for 122 - so for 244 I would go with 10pips and 488 with 15pips.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I am trying to improve the system. I am trying to use it in a different way. Today i took one trade and i was in profit. I have attached my trade and my reason to trade. I think i can come up with a better base number and length than Murrey. Hollowhead, thank you so much ! This is just awesome. Abonocci is going to be the part of my trading system for forever. I have been using fib ratios from very long time. Abonocci changed the way i see fibs and price. This is the first day, first time i am using it. I think length and base number could be improved. We can come up with more profitable baseline/length for abonocci. I am working on one idea that involves developing the baseline and length from previous candle on bigger tf. Does anyone have more ideas to replace murrey with something else ?? Please share your ideas.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I think there's probably a thousand ways to set a baseline. The thing about Bobi's method that is very powerful is that you have many templates with differing lengths giving various targets. Sometimes they appear to conflict, but mostly they create a big picture for a bias and direction and overall target. So, one of the things I am working through is how can we have the same. The advantage of MM levels is that you can see the small levels inside the bigger ones - this will allow us to be more selective in which signals we take. In a sense you are right about using higher TF candles. Bobi did calculations based on the high, low and close on the previous years PA. This in essence gave him levels based on a 1 year candle. Bobi is convinced that support and resistance levels or somehow set in the first day of the year. As mad as it sounds, looking at his templates and charts it is very hard to deny. Many members here have seen Bobi call tops and bottoms to the pip - and they were along way away (time and distance) when he made the calls.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I was just going through the thread you mentioned in first post. I am impressed by the way he set up baseline. I personally feel he is using the calculations done through fib points (where the previous price jumped in past).What i feel he is doing is, calculating the phase size/level from past using fib points/caculations. If you were trading using fib levels or just doing naked chart trading, you will notice how the new candle react based on previous candle. for eg. You will sometimes know that next candle will go 38%, 50%, 76% in opposite and then go back in right direction. I don't know the exact reason for candle going opposite and then going back forward but i personally feel it is to keep people take wrong positions or the result of instability in emotions of people as well as manipulation. And almost everytime, that opposite jump is one of the important fib level. Now, different charts are going to have different phases. You just have to identify the phases level in past and understand what could go next. Every different chart will have its unique need. Not all charts are going to have same phase and level. Right now, i am playing with Open, high, low and close of previous candle and various different type of calculations. Abonacci is awesome. Even when the baseline and length is not perfect, it changes the way you see chart. It gives more emotional stability than other systems. And this murrey math/abonacci hybrid itself will give eight percent + winning when used with other confirmation. Maybe i can figure out how he finds the levels based on the previous baseline prices provided by him.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Great - I have a hunch Bobi used Murrey Math principles - but changed some parameters and calculations. I have spent hours playing with calculations and combos, but I am a 'words' man, not a 'numbers 'guy - so it's beyond me. But, what I can see from looking at the charts is that when you make the Abonacci phases fit the Murrey Math levels on the daily TF, you can apply a set of entry, TP and SL conditions which will give more than a 50/50 win rate with a higher than 1:1 RR. That to me is a key to long-term successful trading. With rules like these there is no discretion. There is open on break, close on SL (move to BE if you want). This eliminates all emotions. It is set and forget. No trying to read candles, no lagging indicators, no concerns about news. You just trade the levels and let it work out. Once you compound winnings - patience is the only battle. Simple (well in theory).

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Well, i am sure we can come up with right calculation by just the previous prices provided by him. Murrey maths, or not. It might not be the exact way he calculated , but again this is mathematics. 2x2= 4, 3+1 = 4, 5-1= 4 and 8/2 is also 4 .. There are different ways to get calculate and get the same answer. We will just need 2-3 same answers for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Go for your life fx01- many have tried over the past two years, but if you can nail it then I will fly to wherever you, shake your hand and buy you a drink. Bobi has given a few clues (but they could be red-herrings). He says it's a very complicated calculation that involves all sorts of maths I haven't even heard of, let alone remember. He has software that calculates it.

Sorry bobha - I missed your contribution earlier - I'll update the first post shortly with baselines, lengths and put a new template on as you suggest. Steve

Hi hollowhead! Congratulations on your new thread! It is a very interesting project, and I wish you Good Luck! Now about the scalping. Have you ever tried to trade M1 using your system? I need more time to test it etc., but so far 30 for x.xxxxx pairs and 39 for xxx.xxx pairs looks promising.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks - I haven't tried scalping this. Scaping is something I want to improve on and really enjoyed your babon thread (it kinda fell apart when you left), but I find it really stressful. But your the man to find the way to scalp this.

Thanks bobha

Good evening friends, I am Brazilian I would like to know the following .. The price levels of Murrey Math (MM) indicator ... this values ​​are changed or remain the same? move to much and how long? For example the USD / JPY pair Level 4/8 101.563 will always be this level or 4/8 will have another price when? Grateful for the attention. I hope everyone here in Rio de Janeiro in the World Cup.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
How did you set this up using Ninjatrader? I think this strategy is worth checking out more.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Is it possible to use this system using Range Bars?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thank you very much HOLLOWHEAD

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi, i am trading gold/usd, How to set the parameter for this template and indicator? I am confused.... and how does it works ?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
The MM levels won't always be the same - they are based on calculations from the last 256 trading days, which means they are likely to remain the same for some time. If they change we will spot it. What I would like to be be able to caluclate the MM levels on a set date range (last year) as opposed to the moving period of time. That way we can be sure they won't change until 1 Jan, but I haven't found a MM Level indicator that allows me to do that yet. In the meantime I don't think its an issue. If the levels change for some reason, we'll spot it here. Steve

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Hollow Head for your simple system, i have one issue my base line figures are diffrent from what are mentioned on first post on pairs i did everything same as per rules then why it is showing different figures. thanks jeet

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi jeetvirk - as long as the baseline is the same as one of the MM levels - it won't make any difference. The baseline simply gives a place to start the Abonacci phases from, and we are looking for 1,2,3 etc complete phases to fit between the MM levels

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Does this work? If not, can you post a chart so I can see what you're looking at?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks Hollowhead, now setting up charts and analaysing them will post my analyses and trades.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thank you ... Success! You want to be in Brazil ... Rio de Janeiro ... I'm here, a big hug

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi all Has anyone got/know a good backtester for MT4, preferably one that I can put use pending orders for? None of the ones I've used previously seem to work with the new build!! Thanks Steve

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hey everyone, Gosh this is my first post ever and I've been a member on here since 2012, dang. I'm stlll a rookie trader, been following a few post like the VPLT by Spudfyre and before landing here the Anbonacci thread by 'Bobi'. So I'm hoping I can learn a lot of new stuff on here that will benefit my trading results. Cheers, ZEKE.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hollowhead, 2 question: 1) How did you choose these parameters? (122, 488) 2) Where do you take and how often does it change the BaseLine?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi hollowhead, Which one you were using? May be i can fix it for you on weekend. Also, I wrote a script for to speed up the work. It's hard to calculate accurate points using crosshair. I was sick of using external calculators so i wrote this quick script in 2 mins. I am attaching the script. This simple script calculates distance between two prices in points. I hope this helps people who are working to develop a better baseline and length. Edit: Included the source code. UPDATE: Updated the script so it wont show points in minus. Please use V2

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great - thanks for the script. That is going to be so useful. As far as bactesting before goes, I've used MT4i - this still works but even with the speed turned up to full it runs so slowly - but that might be the machine I have it on. I normally use Macs and my live trading is done through my broker's web based platform - I only use MT4 for testing, charting and demo and have it on an only Windows based Laptop. I have MT4 on a Mac through a Wine, but getting other windows based programs to work can be a pain. The other one I have used is from LearnForexHome.com - LFH_Trading Simulator_3 - The buy and sell scripts are greyed out and don't seem to work. If you are handy with these things (I'm not), what would it take to code an EA which could be put in the MT4 strategy tester? If we had an EA that work on parameters of something like 1. User option of an abonacci level from where price must have come from. 2. User option of entry level by a specific number of pips beyond an abonacci level for entry, 3. User option of SL and TP distance in pips 4. Would be great to have option to move SL to BE point at user specific Abonacci level (or number of pips) 5. Would be great to have option to test multiple TPs for partial closes. Is this the kind of EA someone here could have a go at, or would I need to go to elance? Now if we had that a few of us could backtest multiple variations of entry, TP, SL to find the perfect set of rules - then everyone woud benefit.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Luca The length parameters are set by the MM Levels - they are (or are multiples of) the distance between Murrey Math Levels. I am not sure how often the levels will change - not often though - and when they do you will see it on the chart, and you simply change the baseline in the Abonacci indicator to match the change. Hope that's clear Steve

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Good to have you here Zeke.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Waifong, I found that 3125 (half of Hollow's 6250) worked out better on my H4 chart with 6250 on the D1.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Good job!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yes i can code EAs. But, i am still a new programmer. (However, i have been coding in php, C# and others from long time.) Instead of Elance, i think it'd be better to hire someone from http://www.mql5.com/en/job I learned mql4 , not too long ago.. I am still learning and improving my skills. I cannot guarantee anything, but i can try.. I have also updated the script of distanceinpointcalculator.mql4 Now it wont show the distance calculated in minus.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
That'd be great fx01 if you could have a go - even if you got the basics done, I could post any refinements or developments on mql5.com. Thanks for your input.

Hi friend,listen,,I did try your tpl,but did not work,I had this problem b4,so my mt4 is 604,new version,do you have another version? b4 any thing ,thank you

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi - I have not heard of anyone else having problems with it - and I have it loaded on build 610. I notice you are having the same issues with alot of indicators and tempaltes from other threads as well, so perhaps the is a problem with your MT4 installation or how you are loading them - other than that I can't help I'm afraid.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
thank's for the response,i'll keep trying,untill ,it could figureout what is wrong, I notice that every time I change to new version it works. anyway thank's

One question: I set the indicators for EURUSD H4. But my baseline is 1.26953 not the 1.3672?! Is the BaseLine the blu line ( Major Support and Resintance) or somethig I missing? I have same problem by GBPUSD H4 My Base Line isn't 1.66016. (red line)

hello every one please help me i have one big problem with abbonaci system ! i wanna trade in 5 min so i use 39 pip on eur /jpy . its not matter what template length u use. price when break 23% we will wait for cross 50% and then after break 50% we will wait cross 76.4% but my problem is : when price come from down to up and break 23% i will set stop lose on 0% ! 1. its big stop loss! 2. more than 60% of times price come and cross my stop loss !!! and 40% is success! . 3. some time price come and break 50% and cross 68% but before cross 76% price have been reverse !!!! and go back to 23% or 38% or 0% !!!! how can i make true trade with better success!??? i understand we can use this base line for gold : 6248 and we can change this length and use its for 6248 / 2 = 3124 and 3124 / 2 = 1563 and 781 and 391 ... 781 and 391 for 5 min! well i have this question what we must do in trade!?? help me? when 6248 tell us on 30 min maybe price goes up or maybe price goes down 3124 tell us on 30 min price goes down 1563 tell use on 30 min price goes down but we will see price come up 781 tell use on 5 min price must goes down 391 tell use on 5 min price must go up! so tell me which temp i must use for true trade in 5min? i need ur help for better deal and lower fail! sorry for my bad english

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I've finally got round to updating the template in the first post to have the MM Level settings as default. I've left the instructions as it doesn't hurt for people to know how to set up the indicators, but with the template they won't have to go through that step for every chart. Steve

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I don't get it! If you use 39 pips, the distance between 0/100 and 23.6 (or between 76.4 and 0/100) is only 9 pips! Do you really think that it is a "big stop loss"? If you buy at 23.6 and set your stop loss at 76.4, it is approximately 18 pips and it is a good stop loss for M5.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Also please re-read the first post! Steve explained about stop losses in details: Guys, pay attention to what the topic starter says, will you?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hi Berci - it doesn't really matter which level you use as baseline as long as your Abonacci phases fit within the MM levels

--- 帖子 #110 ---
As I said before - I don't usually scalp and haven't tested this on the 5m TF. But what I do know is you will have to be much quicker in cutting trades short. Scalping by nature requires a greater level of flexibility and responsiveness. Ranging and whipsawing can be worse on the smaller TFs - you need to be able to read and catch the momentum. Trade only in Franfurt, London, NY, etc Favorite is right - if you look for a break of a 0%/100% level (trade a break that has momentum), enter at the 23.6%/76.4% (long/short), move to BE at the 50%, TP at the 76.4%/23.6%. With scalping you want to stack as many odds in you favour. On the 5min I would make sure I am in line with the 1 and 4 hour trend.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hollowhead Two days ago I stumbled on this heavenly-trading system and I couldnt sleep for 26 hours reading/downloading and just plain starring at my OILUSD chart loaded with it and admiring the genius you guys have put together here. Surely anybody serious CAN NEVER FAIL using this. Therefore I say kudos to you Hollowhead( including Bob the originator of abonacci) for this thread. They always say there is no BEST/PERFECT trading method........I disagree......THIS IS IT! Please do not stop this thread....I m IN. There is one area thats bugging me...........THE START DATE of the Abonacci(annual)-------LENGTH setups per pair or whatever one trades in. Reading thru all relevant threads, there seem to be a mysterious formula but maybe that can be standardised. Otherwise evrything else is plain perfect. There is a lot we can share to enhance entry/exit methodology around this great system, and possibly create an EA. Please keep this thread going....something good will come out of it for sure. I say thank you, Hollowhead

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thanks. "Copy one of the Murrey Math levels (preferably the Support/Resistance Pivot Point level (blue)) into the 'Baseline box' Attached Image (click to enlarge)" Now I understand. I read innattentive...sorry

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hey breakthru - glad you pumped about the system. You are right there is a 'mysterious' formula that bobi uses (hence the baseline). He is convinced that support and resistance levels are set at the beginining of the year (hence the start date for the indicator). He has found that price moves in certain length phases (hence the template length) (he has found over 64 different length phases), and each phase has a specific price behaviour (hence the different) rules. Bobi has been kind eneough to share some of what he has found - enough to be able to profit - but not quite enough to be able to flexible. So the purpose of this thread is to use the same methodology and find price behaviour using abonaccit phases, within Murrey Math levels. Will we be as accurate as Bobi? Probably not, he has spent over 5 years perfecting this and he is not going to give away the golden goose. But, can we get close enough to give us a profitable edge? Absolutley.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Question guys - the abonacci indicator is simple yes? Take a price, specify a length and then create 0-100% fib levels up and down from that baseline. Can anyone recreate it with source code, so that I can get an EA made for it?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hollowhead YES......IT IS VERY SIMPLE. Sir. I really wish I could code. Cheers for replying. The idea of an EA is the only way foward, now that we have found this TREASURE. .........but here is another thought I have been chasing the whole day today.......since this engine is turbo-driven by annual price movements-pre-set parameters...and assuming ALL SETUPS are done accurately(abonacci+mml chart setups) ......Suppose we BREAK the 12 months into monthly price activities..........????. I have a very small powerful method but I am not sure whether you will like it.......so I m not going to devuldge it here till I get your approval. ............But I have this........ Ok(with all due respect for all the effort you have put into this).... please allow me to present a litle thought thats been buzzing in my head ever since I downloaded this treasure. Say we do the normal setups (as you prescribed)...... Then we install 'something' to show us MONTHLY OPEN LINES + WEEKLY OPEN LINES + DAILY OPEN LINES(within the abonacci setups)....... all leading to the closing figure for that month.......hence an Opening price for the following month and every month till the cycle starts the following year. Hollowhead, here is my point...... these OPEN LINES(prices) can be used as bases for an EA. At the background.. with our abonacci system remaining as some kind of REMOTE CONTROLLER OR SAT NAV so to say. To be frank, I fully believe in this system and I think its a blessing for us to be in possesion of it. Bobi could be our Einstein.....you never know......some people get ideas dowloaded to them from heaven. Trust me... this is true. So I fully trust and believe in Bobi 's ideas. Someday...... somebody with coding skills will appear on this thread and basket all our ideas together into a proper EA code. Then... we all cross the Red sea into Canaan. What do you think, Hollowhead about 'opening prices' for the EA project? More ideas will keep flowing as long as we keep this dialogue fluid. I still salute your efforts, Hollowhead.

I have a couple of questions about the Abonacci Tempalate. It is "Supposed" to replicate fib levels correct? How are the fib levels determined? When I use my fib tool and draw fib lines on my chart from various swing highs and lows, my fib lines never match up with the abonacci lines? Also, why are we using the 76.4 level as apposed to the usual (what most professional traders use) the 78.6 level?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Because the fib levels are between the Abonacci phase levels ie a phase is whatever length you put in the indicator (122, 244, 356 etc) . then fibs are drawn between the phase levels. The fibs in Abonacci have nothing to do with swing highs/lows. I don't really know why Abonacci uses 76.4%. I would think it is because it creates equal distance between pairs of levels 0 to 23.6 = 100-76.4 23.6 to 38.2 = 76.4 to 61.8 38.2 to 50 = 61.8 to 50. This means the trading rules in relation to the fib levels will be the same whether going short or long, just inverse. ie break of 23.6 for a long, is the same as breaks of 76.4 short.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Anyone else having problem with murrey indicator ? It seems to show different MM values on different timeframes even when tf and period are predefined in the indicator.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Gotcha! Thank you for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
We have set it to look back over 256 periods (a year on the Daily TF), so when you look at the smaller time frames it will be different, bacuse it is looking back 256 hours, for the 1h TF etc. I am looking for a version that will allow us to set P to a specific date range, as oppossed to a dynamic period.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Steve, I see in the example chart, GBP/JPY, you are trading from the H4 TF but the Abonacci Template is set to 625 which is for the daily TF is this correct?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi Steve, welcome. Yes - to be honest most of the time it doesn't matter what TF you are trading on. The Abonacci levels are set to the MM levels. The MM levels to look back 256 periods (a year on the daily). The MM levels are mostly the same on the Daily as the 4h. It is when you get to the 1h and lower that the MM levels might change. But - my superficial eyeball backtesting at the moment shows the MM levels looking back 256 trading days are the most respected and so I would want to match my abonacci levels to those. Abonacci levels are set to price, so they are the same whichever TF you have your chart. I chose the 4hour for that chart for aesthetics because it expanded enough to show a few trades and also see the numbers and levels.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Steve, I get what you mean about the MMLs but it makes a big difference to how far a trade has to go to reach it's TP level as you can see from the two charts below.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Is there a way to avoid situations where the market ranges around a 100% level RED = Loss Green = Win Blue = Break Even

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Ok - I see - yes I had the abonacci template set to double the MM level distance.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Like most systems, ranging can hurt alot. One of the reasons we want price to have come from the 23% (or 76%) level is to try and ensure there is some momentum. I am searching for some more patterns to recognise - but I guess if anyone could predict when ranging is going to come they would make a fortune. Certainly the ranging is a bigger problem on the smaller templates. The reason for wanting an EA is to thoroughly back test multiple entry, exit, TP, BE combos, to find the most reliable and robust method. The other alternative is to allow two fails and then quit that pair until it resumes trending (ie completed a full phase without you). If your RR is 1:2, then the damage should be limited, and overall you should still be profitable. Folk who know me from the other Abonacci thread know that I often hedge, and sometimes use a hedge zone strategy, but that needs a decent amount of margin and 24hour chart watching to be safe. I know some people martingale until it breaks - which it will eventually, but it is high risk and not something I am suggesting or recommending. I am looking for other methods at the moment. I suspect people will want to throw stochs, macds, RSIs and others at it - my experience is that they can't predict a ranging market, and once you start to get whipsawed it is hard to cut losses. In the end I think it will always come down to money management and capital protection. PS - On your chart I wouldn't have taken the first 4 red trades, or the second blue as price had not come from the 23 or 76 level. The first green is a close call, I would probably have left that out as well. The last red I would probably have given a miss - although price had originally come from swing low, when it broke down below the 100% again, I would want to have seen it come further back to the 76% again, bafore considering another long.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
oh.. I thought this indicator is static because we have to mention the period (1440).

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hollowhead I could be wrong about this....... but I was of the understanding that the whole concept of Abonacci was based on predetermined levels set from the very first day of the year to the last day of that year(specifically JANUARY TO DECEMBER) as Bobi explained). Seems any template or any other settings based on start date of 2013 is no longer valid as we speak(according to Bobi). All because S &amp; R levels for that year are SET on the first day of that year. Seems we have to determine the HLC for 2014, then we can have a good and effective EA to carter for the current calender year. Last night I worked on this(OILUSD) and foud that the MML could be put on constant values thru out the year using calculations based on a monthly value of 43200 and STEPBACKED BY 90 days(given we are now in the month of March).......... this would give an instant baseline on the chart. I think P=1440....needs to be reviewed. ( I used 90 days just to find out where exactly we are now) I did these calculations on OILUSD and it all fitted perfectly(from 02/01/2014) covering all time frames from MN1 down to M5. I think we have to find those preset-beginning-of year-levels.......that way the ranging of prices and all that can be easy to spot. My accounting background taught me that anything to do with numbers can be traced and verified. The calculations are dead simple . The figures I have given are incomplete.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
I know the MMLs are only there for a guide to set the Base Line for the Abonacci Template. But take a look at PA around the major MMLs especially on the Daily TF they can provide very strong signals. Look for pull backs to major levels and then PA to continue with the trend check the EUR/USD D1 chart below. Sorry if this is getting of subject but i think you will find MMLs work very well in their own right.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I agree, on some pairs the MM levels are strong. But I have also noticed that on other pairs there is a certain abonacci level between the MM levels that appears to be more respected. I would suggest when considering a trade having a quick look left and if for example price often seems to reverse at the 50% or between the 38% and 50%, then look to manage your trade a bit closer when price gets there, or even use that as TP.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Funnily enough breakthru, I was just going through the same process. From what I have tested so far we don't need to change anything on the majors. That is probably due to the rubbish ranging we've had recently!! Good spot and suggestion though.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
What you will, usually, find is this will line up with a MML on a lower or higher TF. I used to trade, a lot, using MML on lower TFs this is the first time I've really looked at them on higher TFs. I think I will pay it more attention in the coming days.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
hollowhead May I present a veeeeery tiny method for your approval/scutiny.........This is what I found last night on OILUSD.... i) To get the Base line for this year (2014) say 43200 X 3 months(02/01/2014 to date) =129600 ii) Imput 129600 in MML... thus: MMPERIOD=129600 and set P=0 iii) STEPBACK = 90 ( Now we are looking back 90 calender days)........for April ..it will be plus 30 days =120 .....(30/31days whichever applies that month)until December 2014. [ Now... this 129600 is for the past 3 months, therefore... at the beginning of each and every month we imput 43200 x 4................x5..........x6 till December2014. Now... lets pullout our Abonacci and input the 2014 BASELINE and change date to 02/01/2014. Please note that this baseline can be woobly from day today by 1 or 2pips....at list its for the current year .......adjust it. My opinion is that this might render our trading activities to as closeto those mysterious-nnual S &amp; R levels pre-settings as possible......... and that way ranging price mountains can be detected favourably to us all abonacci maniacs. Stevepatt might readly embrace this idea because I think it aligns well with what he said. Also... in my opinion.. the computation of LENGTH in Abonacci needs a bit of overhaul coz a lot of our guys here seem to be struggling (me too)with that... especially when moving from one timeframe or pair to the other. Together we win no matter what odds I hope this might help us all. PS. I would very much like to be in touch with anybody trading the OILUSD and the BRTUSD........would you be kind to connect me ......Thanks in advance.

Wow - I'm impressed with level of research going into this. There are three elements to how Bobi described his Abonacci trading based on his predeterminatino theory. 1. A formula to calculate a baseline. 2. Different length templates for nearer or longer term views. There is 103, 220, 680, 594, 965, 1030 to name 6 out of over 60) and each of those can be multiplied by 10, 100 and 1000 - that makes alot of template. 3. Rules - each template has different behaviors and therefore trading rules. I don't think anyone is likely to actually work out Bobi's formula - I think it is too complex and has too many possible variables - and I don't think it's the best use of precious time. But, we can work out a formula , with a principle for determing lengths, and a set of rules to trade that. So it seems to me that MM levels for the preceding year give us a baseline - it is based on historical maths and Gann and Murrey knew their stuff - I'm happy to take their lead, they can calculate a starting point with S/R levels above and below. As breakthru suggested we can enter the stepback to Jan 2 for the year, with length 256 to calculate the daily levels, and enter a level to set the baseline. We can calculate the length by distance between MM levels, and either half, double, triple to change size and trade bigger/smaller lengths. I don't think the time consuming bit is calculating a baseline - Murrey and Gann have already done that. The time consuming bit is testing how to trade them... It is the same with the Abonacci thread. Many can see the power of the levels - but trading them is very hard, price repsects them...eventually. There are many who join that thread, but only a few that I can see have stuck it out and are trading live and profitably. I can guarantee it will be the same with whatever baseline or length we come up with. The rules around entry SL, TP, BE is what makes profit - we are in this to earn pips. I'm a realist - I'm not looking to find the holy grail - and if I do I won't be telling any of you . Joke. I just want to find an edge that is simple, clear and can appled to any pair. And I do think MM levels with Abonacci will give us that. So keep it coming - but remember without a set of rules, a baseline and length is only 2/3 there...

hollowhead What you have just said is even more encouraging.........and a good way-foward. But....as our chairman.....( my apologies if giving you a title is offending but its all with all due respect), I would kindle ask if you can surf thru all we have said .........extract from each of us VITAL suggestions, then every Friday/ weekend we all review the past week's submissions, and then concoct... as a group... a powerhouse of our discusions. I mention this coz it would be a pity to see some people fade away from such a well thought out and organised thread you are running here. Brilliant work. It shouldnt be in vain. Moving on.....today...going thru various posts from our members..... I noticed there is a very faint mention of MULTI-TIME-FRAMICITY. in our abonacci project endeavours. Somehow if we could incoporate higher time frames in this project..... well....... if possible.... but we can not avoid MTF trading...its the centre of the whole game.. At least one time frame higher can take us out of the ranging prices misery and unnesesary losses. Ok..say we all trade H4.....all we have to do is make an Abonacci template of 1440 (day)(user adjustable) and launch it in H4. When price MOVES...we MOVE...... ONLY THIS TIME much secure entries coz the DAY(D1) is dragging H4...(either SOUTH or NORTH)....across the MTF mml + MTF abonacci S/R levels.. favourably for us. Just pose and imagine MTF abonacci infused with MTF mml by one two higher time frames. BASELINE etc will be of higher TF. Its like putting a B52 plane engine in a KA car or the 1972 mini car. Above all..... I think our breakthru is just round the corner. Lets keep on talking.

I have discovered a very simple formula to obtain a baseline of guarantees. We take the maximum and the minimum of 2013, in the EU Maximum: 1.38924 Minimum: 1.27438 Difference: 1148 We applied the 23.6 fibo value: 271 This value we add to the opening price of 2014 2014 Opening price: 271 + 1.32633: 1.35343 The 2014 base line for the template 103 is 1.35343 Result:

Hey Hollowhead, First and foremost, thanks for posting this system. It's made chart reading even more fun and it works. However, my biggest gripe is changing the base line figure every-time I open a new graph for a different pair. Has anyone got any ideas to make this process a bit more streamlined? Anyway, thanks again

I have been testing aboonacci (Murrey math baseline) and i have finally come up with good wining after filtering signals using divergence and adx. So far, i have won 9 trades in a row !! YAY! I made profit even in range market by adjusting length. Risk to reward ratio is over 1:1.. Its damn good! I am trading short term and using three templates. For eg. 78,156, 624 length for GBPJPY. Guys, just develop a bias from bigger length chart and take action on smaller one. I am sure you too will discover how well this works! Murrey maths is more than perfect for finding baseline. Just look how well the price respects its support and resistance lines made by murrey. Thank you so much, Steve!!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Also, I wanted to add that I am looking at abonacci levels as a key point where price will continue to go down or up from 0, 23.6 and 76.4. I am not completely relying of abonacci levels. I am using it as tool and confirming it with weak signals (Divergence and adx trend). I know some people will hate me for using adx and divergence as part of this strategy. But this is what is working for me. In short, right now my strategy is abonacci levels (multi-timeframe), divergence(weak confirmation) and adx (weak confirmation). This combination has given me perfect results.

MMPeriod =1440 is the setting used to set up your Murrey Chart on a daily timeframe. 1440 minutes per day. If you want to set up a 4 hour chart then MMPeriod = 240. All signals can be taken off the daily chart since a level is a level whether viewed on a daily bar or a four (hour) candle stick.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi mate, have you thought about 50% of those 256 trading days? That would eliminate subjective baseline setting. Since the Baseline is always the same, say 50% you could compare price behaviour in context of market sentiment and orderflow. So the question that it could be an error of calculation is avoidable. Last but not least, congrats nice thread

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I agree. I think the MTF presents an additional complexity and I am not sure what it adds - a price level is the same whatever TF you are looking at the charts with. I would suggest that if someone wants to trade abonacci/MM Levels on shorter timeframes, then they can set the MM levels to reflect that TF and a desired period back and then set Abonacci levels accordingly. When I first starting trading Bobi's system I loved that the larger templates gave me a bias. However, recently it has become less clear - on EU and GU there are larger template targets both long and short that are hundreds of pips apart. If you are to only trade with the larger template bias you would now be stuck. As we know, there are trends within trends and while spotting a trend is very easy when looking at a single chart, when you introduce higher TF charts things become less clear and traders end up in analysis paralysis. They inevitably enter trades without conviction or confidence, which leads to cutting profits too soon and leaving losses to run - the recipe for a dwindling account. So, I lean towards a system that trades what I see on my chart, if it loses - that's fine, I either hedge or take the loss - either way is fine because my edge and RR means I'm good for the long-term. So, we each decide which TF we personally want to trade on? 15m? 1hr? 4hr? Daily? Weekly? Calculate the MM levels for that TF and a historical period. Take the baseline and insert abonacci levels and then trade a set of (tested) rules? For me, 4h and Daily is where I am most comfortable and where I think MM levels and Abonacci are strongest. I'm wondering whether we will fall in the un-unique FF trap of making something simple, complicated. Please don't take this as a negative or wanting to stop discussion, but I would encourage the pursuit of simplicity. I have said previously setting a baseline and length is only part of the method - trade management/discipline is what makes a good system profit. Just musing...

Honoured to have you visit FX-Ray - I am probably being thick (hence my username), but I am not sure I follow what you mean - would you mind expanding a bit?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thanks alot hollow, of course I try. Since im not into abonacci or MM, forgive me any misconception here, just try to help according to numbers. Well for example G/J : I dont know whether you take the last year or a year back off today. With 50% I mean simply ((H+L)/2) or (1/2)*(H+L) which is the 50% level to use as baseline. So the last year high and low are: 174.51 &amp; 137.83 To put it into the equation: ( (174.51 + 137.83) / 2 ) = 156.17 So the baseline would be 156.17 or 156.25 (rounded) Am still reading some posts, maybe I come up with some ideas for your lenght. It isnt important if you use exactly the 50% or something else, more important to take away subjective settings to put price behaviour into context of market sentiment according to your MM levels. So you can recognize how price behave on those level at any given market phase, up, down, rangebound. Add: through the high and low you can also get a range (H-L) and maybe you can extract the length from it. That would be based on volatility &amp; range then. I wonder how your levels look like then

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Ah ok, I see what your saying - thanks for explaining. I did consider whether to test using the Annual Pivot, but the thing MM levels and Abonacci both do is create phases or rooms. So, matching the two methods to work together seems to make sense to me. Murrey and Gann can provide the baseline, and Bobi Abonacci can give me a template to trade - all I have to do is work out and trade the patterns of how price tends to respond to the levels. Simple in concept... in practice? Well that's the trading journey isn't it. Anyway, I'm deeply respectful of your experience, trading ability and willingness to share.

MMM.. interesting.. why did you pick 236??

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I just wondering One thing.Did they any significance about baseline?If the price goes up to Baseline or If price goes down below the baseline,Does it means anything special? Or Baseline requires to meet abonacci 100% to murray math level...

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I understand it's an important level in the Abonacci system because the price to open operations should come from this level of the previous phase.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
If you set the baseline to the dark blue MM level - this is the central MM pivot level. I understand it to be a significant level, but it would only change whether I trade the abonacci phases if looking back I can see price consolidates or spikes at that level - if it has previously I might give it a miss and find another pair.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
First of all, thank you very much for your system. I have 10 trades so far and it seems very promising! I got like 10% return in demo. You mentioned if you see consolidates or spike at the blue MM level, you might find another pair. Is that the way you choose which pair to trade? coz it shows whether that blue MM level is effective to certain pairs? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Hi wongsiio - I am trying to use common sense in choosing pairs. For example I am considering which currencies are strong and weak, which pairs have been trending on the daily/weekly chart, which has had a pullback. ie GBP has been trending up and I think has further to go. JPY - I am always biased short with the yen. AUD - this is on a large pullback - or a longer term trend reversal. So, AUD or GBP longs against the JPY would seem to me to be going with the flow. I'm not massively keen on EU as a pair - mainly as I think it has new highs to make (according to the Bobi's Abonacci templates), but also has lower targets to meet - so for me it's a mixed picture. Also, on my main live account I have been hedge in a large EU trade which is slowly unlocking, and I need to remain focused with that pair on sorting that out.) I generally (but not always) want to trade a phase up that's followed a pullback, as oppossed to taking an abonacci phase break into new highs where there may be big resistance. Trading the phase following a pullback can be slower, trading a phase thats a new high break can be quick and if it breaks give you a quick win - but, there's always the chance of a massive reversal half-way though - so I would be quicker to get to BE in that case. PS - I should say, once I have access to an EA I will back test mutliple pairs with various rules. This will provide stats that will be independent of bias, and show the strength of the system without considering market/currency recent behaviour.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
MM thanks for reply.. worth thinking about.. I am using it a different way which has been good .. but at this point in time I haven't been paying that a much attention to 236..once again thks for reply..

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Thanks for your detailed explanation! It does make sense to me! Your whole theory to find pairs to trade is more than reasonable. But I do agree with u that to use EA to test without being bias is way more important as the abonaccis system is designed to trade without concerning the market and currency behavour but abonacci levels. I have 10 trades so far and I will do the forward testing your system like 100 trades to see how the result looks like and make a conclusion later.I have been trading with Fibonacci and 23.6% seems to be a very amaziing level for me but you show me another world. Love your combination of Murry math and abonacci! Keep Going!

To get your Rooms Take the overall high - low for the month 1 = monthly range divide by 2 = 1/2 range add and subtract (1/2 range month 1) to the close of the first day of month 2 apply fib retracemetns to the internal rooms To get your PIP rules Take difference of high-low of each day within the month (daily chart) = daily range for month 1 obtain the std dev of the daily range divide the std dev of the daily range by the monthly range to normalize the daily ranges to the monthly ranges.

EA Ok I have a list of questions from the coder,No disrespect but If Hollowhead can answer please, My short list of questions: 1. Is Start_Time of the grid important for EA? Or can I simple make EA start when it is attached? 2. I guess you will need two separate sets of parameters for buy and sell. Something like: For Buy: - Starting Fibo line - +/- pips from starting Fibo line - Ending Fibo line - +/- pips from ending Fibo line - SL/TP/BE For Sell: - Starting Fibo line - +/- pips from starting Fibo line - Ending Fibo line - +/- pips from ending Fibo line - SL/TP/BE Is that right? 3. How many trades can be open at the same time? One or more? For example, when price keeps going up and crosses two or more sections. Should the second buy trade be opened even when the first is still not closed? 4. Can buy and sell trades be open at the same time? For example, when price crosses one section up and then goes back to lower section. Thanks P

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Paulus Thanks for the questions. 1. No. The start time isn't important for the EA. As long as it is working from the Abonacci indicator length and baselines entered by the user. 2. Yes - that sounds right. 3. Can this be made as a user option? If it's one or the other I would say allow multiple entries. In typical environments I don't think more than one would open anyway. If trades are set to operate within a phase (0-100%) i.e. for a long 'buy@ +/- pips from 23.6% fib', close at '+/- pips 76.4% fib', the trade would have closed by reaching TP before price enters the phase above. Having said that being able to build a longterm trade with multiple entries would be good to test, so having the ability to turn specify would be great. 4. Again can that be a user option. I for one like to hedge and would like to test that, but I know for some (ie US citizens) they can't. On that note I have a whole hedging EA I would like to investigate for backtesting, but I think it would be too much to include in this.... Please thank your coder for me. Steve

is it possible to use this system in small time frame like 1 min 5 min 15 based on higher timeframe levels. IF yes, what are the values have to put in the input. thanks

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Probably, although I have tested it. I would look at finding the MM Levels on the 1h chart and then scale down the abonacci length to 30 (or 39 for JPY pairs). Favorite said he might look at it - if he does and comes back with a suggestion and you want to scalp then I would listen to his suggestions - he is a master scalper.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi, Just new to this thread - found it by accident - but not new to trading the ABO system. However searching the web and some old BoBi posts - I found a post where he says that the current phase of the month normally was 127 on the EU it s now 133 for more accurate results. The attached chart is with a setting of 133 - and hits the sell target of 23,6 nicely. What´s your guys take on this. Comments are welcome. Thanks. Hans

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Hans Interesting - I had also read that Bobi used 127 as part of his calculations for the original Abonacci EU system. It's interesting to me that 127 is very near 122, which is one of the multiples of the distance between MM levels on non JPY pairs (122, 244, 488 etc). Good to have a abo-fficiando (see what I did there) dropping in...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi hollowhead, comments are welcome.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi Steve, Thanks for the nice welcome I will surely stick around here and contribute with what I can. However I found some of the "old" Bobi rules on my pc and it states that the 38,2 level is the one to watch for further up/down moves. Just curious why you have decided on the 23,6 level for entries. " - The key point of our trading when we are using power 3 template is 38.2 % if this level is broken from below then price should reach 76.4% and eventually the 100% level. Now for price to continue in its upward journey price should not come back down and break the 61.8% level of the phase below, if this is broken than the immediate direction would have changed. That was for the upside Now if price is heading down then the 61.8% level becomes key as this is the equivalent of the 38.2% from the other side so if this level is broken then price should reach the 23.6% level then the 0% level, however as before, this is a rule based system once price has broken the 61.8% (when we say broken we are referring to 7-10 pips) then price should not go back into the above phase and break the 38.2% level if it does then like before the immediate trend would have changed direction." Also for my trading I use this indi - where you can change the phase override to a specific pair. I hope it will help someone as it takes it´s data from the last month´s numbers as I think it was originally intended from Bobi when he was active and releasing new templates every month. The attached chart is the AU with a setting of 133 pips override on the phase. Anyway I´m hoping not to clutter up your thread with my mombo jombo if I am just tell me so - just wondering why you have chosen the 23,6 level for entries ? Thanks for your reply. Kind regards, Hans P.s also adding 2 charts where the 61,8 level was in play as per Bobi´s old rules - if price whants to continoue up it should not go below the 61,8 of the phase below. Hence looking at these to charts, earlier entries at the 23,6 level for long and a loss could have been avoided.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
There a several reasons for choosing 23.6. 1. If we set the baseline and levels to MM Levels and distance, then 0% would act as the S/R area, and therefore 23.6/76.4 would be a point beyond that represents enough pips of a break. A break of 23.6 with target 76.4 is trading a good chunk of the move between MM levels. 2. Bobi specifies 38.2/61.8 for his original template 3 - from what I understand that system was only ever for EU. He said his later templates and rules (which supercedes the original system) could be applied to any forex pair, stock (and even geographical water supply) - but we are dependent on Bobi to provide baselines each year. Those templates had differing lengths and rules - some of the templates use 23.6 and 50 as entry and TP levels, so 23.6 is a valid level to trade with certain abonacci phase lengths. 3. The most practical reason is that it provides a more tradeable system. Using 23.6 as entry and 76.4 as TP, with SL just behind 100% provides approxiamtely 1:2 RR. Many have struggled with SL placement with Bobi's templates and lengths. Bringing the entry forward with SL behind the 100% makes sense and in my visual scanning looks good for a 50/50 or more win rate. One thing I want the system to be able to do is be applicable across the board. I've never understood retail traders obsession with EU - to me it is a vastly overated trading pair. I want to be able to trade abonacci principles beyond EU (and the GU and AU we have on the other thread). It may be that different pairs will need different rules and levels - I'm open to that and testing for it with the EA Paulus is having built. But to me having a system with a clear edge, clear rules and profitable money management means I can trade with confidence and peace...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Sorry sniper - missed that one - I can't open the chart image to see the pair you're trade is on. It sounds about right do you know whether you are trading with the longer term trend.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
thanks Steve for your reply - I see your point in choosing the 23,6. However looking at the EC and another of Bobi rules and I qoute. "If price moves 302 pips away from the baseline than it is said that the trend will be in that direction. So if price than turns back around and back down it should not come all the way down and break the base line. This equates to the 38.2% level of the 3rd phase i.e. price has moved 302 pips from base line. Now if the price moves 429 pips away from the base line than in either direction than price cannot come back break the trend and change its direction.( to avoid confusion please pay attention to the words " should not come " and " can not come". When it is said should not come , it means to keep a good uptrend going , the price should not come below the base line otherwise it will signal of a big drop . But when 429 pips going away from Base Line the price can not come below the base line as it has no tendency to do that and in case it happens , then this rule will be valid no more and will be omitted from the list of rules forever ) " It seem pretty accurate using a setting of 133 for that pair also. However I am having some troubles identifieng what he means when the above is applied. Would price rise or fall ? Sorry I have to Google translate. Thanks once again Hans

Several people have asked for Oil - I would use Basline 100.00 and length either 1250 or 625.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I appreciate your input and digging out Bobi's Hans, I am sure there are principles in there we can apply. There are alot of rules to Bobi's original system that I could not pin down in one place. So TBH I chose not to engage that system. I do think Bobi considered the systems in the second thread he started here on FF as more accurate and improved, and so that is where i studied and traded Abonacci. For both systmes and through his testing Bobi was able to make some very bold claims about what price must do, and if it doesn't what would happen next - I cannot and will not make such bold statements. What we can do here though is test to find patterns and probabilities - we can then say "if price has come from 'x', and crossed the S/R level of 'y', then on the balance of probability it will reach 'y'". And if it doesn't, our money management is good and our accounts are safe. We take the loss (with a smile on our faces, which is the right way to take a loss), and look for the next 'probable' trade. Our edge, R:R and money management will ensure our profitable futures. After this thread has been running 5 years or we have thoroughly backtest 5 years of data, we may be able to be a little more confident to say that price always does XYZ - but I think by then, things may have changed again...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
couple more question to be answered please Hollowhead I would like to make sure about one thing. Entry is made only when price goes from one section to another, right? There are no entries within the same section. Is that correct? For example: ... -------100 -------76.4 -------61.8 ( B ) -------50 -------38.2 -------23.6 ( A ) -------100 -------76.4 ... We can’t have entry when price goes from ( A ) to ( B ) in the same section. It has to move more than 100, right? P

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Paulus - thanks for sticking with it. If I have understood the question correctly the answer is Yes. I'll use a long example ------- 100 ------- 76.4 ------- 61.8 (B) ------- 50 ------- 38.2 ------- 23.6 (A) ------- 100 ------- (SL) -------76.4 (X) Price must have come from the 'X', risen passed 100 into the above section. Entry and exit at A and B as you decribe. If price reverses and SL is above the original 'X' level so the trade closes, then price must go below 'X' and rise again to trigger another trade. We don't want (A) being triggered multiple times in that phase. Only if it crosses X and goes into the above phase again can a new trade be triggered. Paulus - can 'X' be user defined? ie 76.4 +/- pips. Not a problem if not - we can use 76.4 for buy and 23.6 for sell.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
That's a good approach as long as you are clear on when to close it out. I find that sometimes phsycologically letting it run can be harder than just closing. In principle its great and gives you the opportunity to catch the mega waves. But, in my experience it is also easy to watch it run see your P/L grow and then it reverses, it's all too easy at that point to keep hold of it and watch those profits dwindle. Then you have the mental battle of shoulda, coulda, woulda. When you have a definate TP. You can sit back and watch price run afterwards and be proud that you kept to your plan. Sticking with a plan gives confidence and peace of mind. I don't want to discourage you from letting it run, but I would say have a clear point, whether its a level, reversal point etc when you know it is time to stop it running.

@hallowhead, since we know the level of 76.4 and 23.8 before hand, what is your suggestions to putting pending orders before hand . so that we get the perfect entry at the level mentioned ? sl and tp can also be punched in before hand . as per your system all we need to know is the way the price is travelling from down to up or up to down .

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Absolutely - that's how I tend to trade abonacci - espcially as one of Bobi's phases is only 103 pips in length and TP is 40 pips. With Pure &amp; Simple, I am generally trading phases that are 244 pips and higher. I do not mind missing a few pips either side - remember, we are trying to profit on a chunk of pips in a move between levels.

But individual or group skype is just a step too far in terms of time and commitment for me at the moment. Also, I want as much to be shared openly. If you have a question, then chances are it is something somebody else is thinking/wondering or it has been answered in the thread (you'd be amazed how many questions I get via PM that are clear in the first post/page). If you have found something in the system that is work for you then I would encourage you to share it.

Dear hollowhead, Thank you for sharing this strategy. I observe that I cannot upload the Abonacci Templates Manual on the New MT4 platform. What am I suppose to do to upload it. Kindly assist. http://assets.forexfactory.net/images/attach/ex4.gif Abonacci Templates Manual v7-1.1.ex4

So whatever happen you will wait until SL or Tp hit ? not considering any PA on SR area ? Like this EU Target is 1.38577 but now price make an engulf bar (on H4) and close below 50% level do you consider to cut your profit or let the trade run ? since we already move SL at BE by now (Entry @1.37389)

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Pretty much - they're too subjective for me. Look left and there is a massive bullish engulfing - change to the daily chart and their is a bullish engulfing following and IB. I've spent a huge amount of time flicking through charts, differing TFs only to end up being able to justify just about any position based on candlestick patterns and price formations. Having said that, there are some really obvious Weekly, monthly, TLs that I do pay attention to. I work on the basis that if I've spotted it, then everyone else has - and yes there will be reaction, and the market makers have created it, and know retail traders will react to it, so will it be a fake out etc? For me there are just too many questions that, if I am honest, I am just guessing at answers to. I'd rather take a position, set a target, if it hits, I profit, if it doesn't I take the loss, smile and move on. Learning how to lose a trade well was a major step forward in my trading. In terms of BE - I don't always go there. There is no particular rational, if I see price is losing momentum I might look to lock some profit in, take some off the table etc. But this is very much a trader's personal preference. I think in some market conditions moving to BE can lose you profits, in others it can save your account. I will test BE scenarios when the EA is ready. I wouldn't actually be (and am not) in the current EU long. Price hasn't come from the lower 76.4% level (1.36140) to qualify it as a long trade. Steve

Dare, I just recently had the same problem. You can no longer upload templates or indicators the same way you used to with the previous mt4. Now you have to open up your mt4 platform. Next at the top left of the screen click on file, then click open data folder, click MQL4, click indicators and attach the abonacci template. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I'm not aware of anyone else having problems. Note that it is an indicator (even though Bobi names it as a template), so it needs to go in the MQL4/Indicators folder. Steve

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks Al

Okay thanks for your explanation. so it likely set and forget skenario with set of rules you provide in page 1. Thanks again for sharing this one i'll try to post my trade base on this approach.

Thanks hollowhead for sharing this strategy. Nzd/usd hit 23.6% level today, 100 pips

--- 帖子 #220 ---
@hallowhead. i went thru the orignal master's thread and also yours. there are certain things which are changed than the original and hence need clarifications 1. how murray math way incorporated into this system to find the base line ?? 2. original boby thread did not reveal how he arrived at the baseline except that he used last year hlc . 3. 76.4 and 23.8 entry is fine but finding the base line is the crux of the entire system . pls throw some light on this. I believe in what boby has said , just these things need to be clarified .

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I can't believe I have to type this again, but here goes - I'll try and put it another way. 1. This is not Bobi's system - I do trade his most recently shared system and you can see me all over the thread, which I reference it in post 1. 2. As you say Bobi's system depends on his templates and baselines - from that thread we have some templates and baselines for three (3) pairs. 3. Many on the thread wanted to be able to trade more instruments and not depend on Bobi's availability each year. So I started this thread having been inspired by ubenders to trade Abonacci/Fib levels using Murrey Maths as the basis for baselines and Abonacci lengths. NB. No-one is more grateful for what Bobi has given and shared than me, however, we all need to be able to trade independently into the future, and to be successful traders we each must develop our own method and way. Every successful trader will tell you this is an absolute truth. 4. I use the 23.6 and 76.4 levels because they give me a better RR and show a clear break of the MM levels. Many have struggled with SL placement as Bobi was more than vague on it. So I trade the levels for entry, TP and SL that give me a near 1:2 RR. Hope that clarifies.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
yes, I stand clarified and well i have shared my modification of the system without murray math .

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Looks very good, what setting so I need to use if I want to trade XAUUSD? And if I'm correct you can just put a BUY STOP and a SELL STOP at those lines and wait

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Length - 6250, baseline - 1500

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi Steve and fellow traders - Just want to make sure I am doing it correctly. I still can't post pics but that is just me. This is based on 14:54 eastern daylight savings time in the U.S. OK - E/J is presently sitting at 142.790 which is below the 76.4 line - It has come from above the 76.4 line but not from above the 100 line --- So in my understanding -- THERE IS NO SIGNAL FOR A TRADE - I have however set an ENTRY ORDER just above the 23.6 in the phase above the current phase just in case it decides to go there because it will have come from 76.4 lower phase, gone above 100 and hit 23.6. Are all these actions correct based upon Pure &amp; Simple? Tom Edit: I am trading on H4 with a setting of 312 and baseline 137.500

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi Tom - hope you're well. I would agree - It's pretty the same as T5_103 with defferent entry levels. I would want price to have come from the 23.6 above for the short to be valid, but I would consider the EJ long worth a go. I have two pendings set on UJ straddling the current position. I think it will break one of each way (obviously). It's one of those situations where the long is very close to triggering, but a short would be valid as well. FX01 mentioned using ADX and I think he is on to something - I've found that it is a good filter (and MACD Divergence) and compliments nicely. I used it to filter my GJ trade which is doing nicely on the TE account and also unlocked a large GJ hedge I had on another account. I am going to look back a little more, and although it pains me, I might add a new template with some additional indicator filter options based around them - but that's will not be free reign for the imdi junkies to come and score .

--- 帖子 #233 ---
hollowhead, my baseline for AU is 0.92773

--- 帖子 #234 ---
That's fine sniper - it won't make any difference to the levels. I just have a thing about lining the baselines witht the MM Major S/R pivot (dark blue line). But as long as the baseline is the same as one of MM levels and the length is a multiplication or division of 244, it doesn't really matter (I'm using 244).

--- 帖子 #235 ---
NZDUSD is getting close for a SHORT, entry is 0.85153. And does someone know the calculation for the Baseline?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
i'm using 244 too. thanks for the prompt reply ATM AU break out 76.4% and 50% level, going to touch 23.6% level soon fabje, NU baseline 0.83008, TP 0.84652/0.84338 but keep in mind 0.85xxx (strong support) updates: Seems to be at an interesting level of support @8500, maybe NFP will try bring it down...

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Steve... I have started reading through the thread... nice discovery using MM.. how are you finding your trades so far with this system? profitable? better than abonacci? cheers jay

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Jay - going well at the moment thanks. As you can see from my TE I think it's 7 wins, 4 losses, 1 in profit and 1 in DD, 2 floating around BE at the moment. We'll see what happens in time. In some ways I prefer it to Abonacci as I can look at any pair and be picky about the trades. So I'm looking for trades that are consolidating around a level and look like they want to move, or where I can tell we have one weak and one strong currency. You might of read that Paulus has kindly asked his coder to build an EA, which once we have working means we can thoroughly back test which levels give the greatest win rate, what the break needs to be, what the optimum SL and TP are, and whether moving to BE is a good strategy. I'm looking for proven tradeable levels and TP/SL, that gives more than 50:50 win rate with RR or 1.5-2, and clear rules (I know, that's what we're all looking for right?). But I'm sure it's in here somewhere, so far on live testing it's looking good, but always aware that we need to test through various market conditions etc. Still, it's good to be in the hunt and pips are coming at the moment so I can't complain. You back in blighty?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
very nice... i am looking for proper SL also.. time is another one i would like to learn but i don't think there is much apart from gann... yup i got back last week... leave for Cape Town though a week monday so not much time for markets

EA I have attached the EA please load and post any questions which will be best anwered by Hollowhead Hollowhead - any concerns or changes required please let me know,I havnt loaded the EA myself yet I have only just received it Here is the list of instructions from coder... ------------------------------------------------ There are two sections of inputs, for buy and sell separately. Buy/Sell Input parameters: Lots – position size Start_Level – fibo level where price movement must start End_Level – fibo level where price movement must end Start_Plus_Minus_Pips – you can adjust Start_Level by +/- pips End_Plus_Minus_Pips – you can adjust End_Level by +/- pips SL/TP/BE in pips Grid input parameters: BaseLine (price), Length (in pips) – the same as in the indicator Other options: Max_Trades – max number of trades that can be open at the same time Hedging [true/false] – can buy and sell trades be open at the same time Market_Execution, Magic_Number – the same as in all previous EAs Price is first recorded when EA is attached to the chart. When you reattach it or reinitialize in any other way (for example by changing its parameters), it will start again from a new starting price. EA does not use the Abonacci indicator. It calculates the grid itself. You can attach the indicator yourself if you want to see the grid, but it does not matter for the EA. EA works on the strategy tester, so you can test it quickly if you like. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- P

--- 帖子 #247 ---
WOW Paulus. Thank you (and your coder) so much.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Nice Paulus, I have a quick question lets say we have a 23.6% price of 0.89400. Will the EA open a LONG in this case when the ASK price reaches 0.89400 or when the BID price reaches that price? During my test period of two days now manual using a SELL and BUY STOP, it opens a trade using the ASK price but the BID price never got there.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but could you not factor the spread in when you enter the Start_Plus_Minus distance?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Could be, but you need to do it for every pair and the spread isn't always the same.

Hi jmss - I will let people test the EA for a while, and if people want to feed back requests , alterations that they feel will help (here or via PM), I will post them for Paul as one list, as opposed to sending multiple requests and ending up wasting his and the coders time. In the meantime - you can always look at the report section of the strategy tester - that will tell you the number of consecutive losses for a period, which will give you some idea as to how harsh the martingale would have been for that period. FOR NEWBIES - DO NOT MARTINGALE UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHAT THE RISKS ARE. I will not accept any responsibility in anyone's account being wiped out.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Again grateful and applaud your consistency in the management of thread.

I find the ea is not taking all the trades but missing some , some explanation from programmers as to how it works will help . secondly i tried to fiddle with this system and i find that for EU if we put the week pivot as the baseline level and using the murray math to find the length of each level if we put it , it gives a better trade and also remains valid for the week . all we do is fire sell at 76.4 and fire buy at 23.8 .

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Entered Long on NU - TP at 76.4% line. Uptrend in place now,price a rise from below phase (76.4%) break 23.6% level( + 7pips) and closed above 100% hollowhead, This chart is correct as rules that have been set?

I have been doing forward testing with all major pairs with setting 122 and 156 for yen pairs. So far I have 22 closed trades and 4 open trades and the profitability is indeed! I got 45% win ratio so far but with the 1:2 RR and move stop to BE when price reach 50% as thread starter pointed out and trade regardless of the price action and candle sticks and etc. coz trading to trade without being bias. I will post my complete trade record when I reach 50 trades coz I do not want to post anything chart here and get comments to make me become bias with this system. Cheer up guys! This is a very good system. I still remember a scientist did the experiment about throw the heads or tails and with good money management still won the game at the end. with this simple and effective system , we should focus more on money management instead of keep fine tuning the settting and stuffs.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi guys, I found this system very interesting and started going through some of the materials this morning. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't seem to be seeing the profitability? I plugged this system into a daily EUR/USD chart and according to the trading rules, here are all the trades you would have taken dating back to April last year: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And you would have tallied up the total: Loss (4): 4608 pips Won (2): 5152 pips Broke Even (2) Total: Profit 544 pips (entire year). It's a win for the year, but 544 pips in a whole year? Wouldn't this figure be a little low and the risk be a little high? I might have misinterpreted some things here and please correct me if I am wrong. I think I have setup the charts and indicators correctly: Attached Image Attached Image

Hi unimak (sorry not to respond sooner). I would really like to know how the levels are calculated, their significance etc. We really don't need another thread where members are dependent on a 'secret' or 'person'. If you are happy to explain the premise behind the levels, then I have no problem with you posting them (as long as members would be able to calculate them themselves). But I would ask that they fit with the basic concept of the thread and the calculation is transparent.

A few people have asked about the significance of the MM levels - here's a quick overview of how the levels are normally perceived. 8/8th and 0/8th Lines (Ultimate Resistance) These lines are the hardest to penetrate on the way up, and give the greatest support on the way down. 7/8th Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse) This line is weak. If prices run up too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse down fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move up to the 8/8th line. 6/8th and 2/8th Lines (Pivot, Reverse) These two lines are second only to the 4/8th line in their ability to force prices to reverse. This is true whether prices are moving up or down. 5/8th Line (Top of Trading Range) The prices of any currency will spend 40% of the time moving between the 5/8th and 3/8th lines. If prices move above the 5/8th line and stay above it for 10 to 12 days, the currency is said to be selling at a premium to what one wants to pay for it and prices will tend to stay above this line in the “premium area”. If, however, prices fall below the 5/8th line then they will tend to fall further looking for support at a lower level. 4/8th Line (Major Support/Resistance) This line provides the greatest amount of support and resistance. This line has the greatest support when prices are above it and the greatest resistance when prices are below it. This price level is the best level to sell and buy against. 3/8th Line (Bottom of Trading Range) If prices are below this line and moving upwards, this line is difficult to penetrate. If prices penetrate above this line and stay above this line for 10 to 12 days then prices will stay above this line and spend 40% of the time moving between this line and the 5/8th line. 1/8th Line (Weak, Stall and Reverse) This line is weak. If prices run down too far too fast, and if they stall at this line they will reverse up fast. If prices do not stall at this line they will move down to the 0/8th line.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I mentioned before that I have been testing using ADX as a filter. For those who don't know about ADX a quick google or FF search will fill you in. Basically you have 3 lines, D+ (green), D- (red) and ADX (white). There are three levels I have marked out 10, 25, 40. The D+ shows the strength of the bulls, the D- the strength of the bears. When green is above red, the bulls are stronger When red above green, the bears are stronger. The ADX line is used to indicate just how strong the bears or bulls are (ie the strength of the trend). Pointing up, means getting stronger, above 25 means strong trend, above 40 means very strong trend. On the chart below, the green arrows show D+ crossing above D-, and the red arrows show D- crossing above D+. Application - you can use it as a filter to see the consolidation and breakout into your trade. You can also use as a TP or BE filter, or even to add to trades on the pullbacks. As they say, a picture says a thousand words.

Excellent work Paulus and hallowhead. I want to ask if there is the possibility of incorporating a kind of martingale EA , I mean, if an operation fails in the next step we get the EA can make double the position of the failed operation , you put an example I open a transaction with 0.5 lots, this fails, the next operation of the same pair entered with 1 lot and so on until the system hits the operation , and when the successful operation closes then the next is entered again with 0.50 lots. Sorry my English is very poor but it is hope you've got the idea . I also want to say that EA now makes only one entry per phase. Can it be programmed so that if an operation fails reopen another within the same phase ? Example : The price opens a sales operation at level 61 but the price turns and reaches my stop 37 pips but does not reach the level 23 of the upper phase and falls back again reaching level 61 , then open another operation position twice . Is it possible to program the EA to perform this operation ? Attached is a graphic example . I hope you understand the operation. Thank you very much for the time you spend me . regards

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Paulus Thanks for all your work on this - lot calculation based on a percentage of account would be really good. Also, is it too much to ask if you could produce a version with the two additions JMSS asks for. 1. I know you asked this before and I said no, but can you provide an option to allow users to re-enter a trade if SL hit, WITHOUT price needing to return to the START point again. 2. Would you be able to incorporate a 'controlled martingale' facility on the lots, doubling up until it either hits a user defined number of trades or until the next successive winning trade. Thanks Steve

Thank you hollowhead for sharing this system. As I said I would share my trade result, I trade all pairs with 122 for major and 156 for yen pairs and there result may not amaze you eyes but the stable profits gain each week seems convincing and suitable for using larger amount to risk per trade. Each trade I risk like 0.5 % like u can see my average lose is about USD30 However, u can see my summary, my win ratio sometimes close to 50% but never really equal to 50%, always between 40%-50% but the Risk to Reward did the job. maybe that's becoz i am trading smaller pips range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Even this is sorta mechanical system coz just setting pending orders every time, however, it seems possible to win the game in a long run as the money management is simple and efficient. Anyone trade like scalping successfully? I would really wanna scalp with this system. I will keep the forward testing until 100 trades to see the profitability later. Nice weekend!

This is on a similar scenario to bobis templates... I can see why he hasn't given us more than he already has as they are conflicting and no one knows which ones have priority... its also true markets are changing over time so templates would more than likely become less reliable over time until they are changed to match current market conditions... not to move off the subject however... if you have this system working as a stable pip gaining machine... then we can look to perhaps change some of the maths or rules to better match current market conditions... Unfortunately my day job is getting busier and is my no1 priority financially therefore, I am not able to spend much time on backtesting but if we all put a some thoughts into it, we maybe able hit the nail on the head for... Great work on starting and sharing this system up to all of you

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Actually this system did not amazing but its simplicity does. It just prove that money management is the main key to profit not which indicator or template we use or any analysis. Of course it would be a lot better result if you have some edges to analyze the direction but even u don't u can still make money with strict money management. However, we cant have it all, like high winning ratio with high risk to reward. that's impossible. Like in real world, we always have to lose sth in case to gain sth else, we just make a balance between losing and wining. Hope that helps ppl still struggling to get high wining ratio instead of return. and lets share thoughts about trading the system but of course i am not talking about adding more and more indicators on the screen to create an complex system.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
i also disagree with adding more indicators - but it could be refined like bobi's system where a certain level must not break before reaching a known target - bobi's system has become less reliable in this category but it used to be spot on... when a level wasn't supposed to break - it never did. And that was the beauty of having levels and phases on a chart. i am simply talking about refining the phase sizes, entries, exits... looking to see where the potential important levels on this MM system matches those on bobi's templates...

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hello people, first post in FF here, though I have been watching this thread for some time, still in the process to learning some or two things here. First of all, I need some advise whether I put the templates correctly, I put two picture, one EUR USD which I think seemed right template, second one is USD JPY which I think might "move" the entry line seemed to be not 23.6% but to 50% in JPY (perhaps I put it wrong??) it seemed to me the entry point for long in USD JPY would be 50% line (in my chart thou) is the real case or am I put the wrong set up on the charts? dryearth

--- 帖子 #305 ---
ya refining the phase sizes and entries and exit like bob's template is a good idea but I do think that to have higher successful ratio means lower return and also less entries. This system actually reminds me of the turtle trading which i learnt when i started trading FX. They have winning ratio like 30-40%, however they manage to gain 300% a year. We probably need to have intense research to see how to refine the phase size and entries and that does not guarantee the future performance. What I would really wanna find out is if this system could apply to any phase size and still probable with trading the same way i trade now? Lets find out the answer together, my friend!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Dear hollowhead i need your instruction for this conditions, please see image. In this situation what should i do..? should i wait for the Price comes from 23.6% level drops Below 0%/100% into the phase below. Then enter short when price breaks the 76.4%. Take Profit is the 23.6% level...? I mean what should we do if the price is in range that phase..? Forgive me if my question sound very silly... ~regards~

--- 帖子 #307 ---
If it was me I wouldn't do anything. I don't like EU and am always baffled by retail traders' obsession with it. I wouldn't go long unless price pulls back to the 76.4% of the lower phase, and I would be wary of a short as its against the short/medium trend. If price is clearly ranging, perhaps it's time to find a pair that isn't. GL Steve

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Many thank's for your explanation. Now i can see more clearly, any suggest how to look price or pair in action...? Please if you don't mind i want to have contact with you in private. Can I..? Once again thank you for your attention. Best Regards

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I tend to have in mind the currencies that I think are strong and weak at the moment (this week/month). ie. I see GBP, AUD as being strong. I see JPY as being weak. So for me, I'll look to go long G/J or A/J - this is obviously not foolproof but it gives you an idea. With so many pairs to trade I know it can be hard to decide, which I think is why so many people default to EU - and they keep slogging away when there are other options. By all means PM me, but if you have questions I would encourage you to post them so everyone can benefit and share from the collective wisdom of the members.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
semar82 I think your situation prevails in the minds of all us traders when trading. My opinion is that your focus and entries should be determined by the direction of the .MN+W1+D1 candles........that is... if all the three candles are of the same colour and trending........then trigger entries in their direcion /colour. The main candle is the MN....so when the MN is blue..... but for that moment it breathes (downwards), that makes the D1 candle and lower time frames to temporarily show RED. All you do is wait till D1 candle moves in the same direction as the MN and the W1......then trigger as per abonacci recomendations. I hope this might help.

hi, breakthru56 thank you for your advice, i will keep in my mind to see the price in the big picture. regards

--- 帖子 #312 ---
NU tried 3 times closed below 76.4% since 10 apr 2014 after new high around 0.87422. based on abonacci &amp; MM the price will be touch zone 0.857xx. I'm still holding my short, break and close below 0.86380 will take this pair to .85736

Hi Hollowhead, I have subscribed this thread,... also follow to trade with your baseline and size,.... Kindly guide me how to do the setting for GOLD ? I need the setting from you as the expert for this system. Thanks in advance,... Cheers, Budi D

--- 帖子 #315 ---
If you want to listen to a non-expert you could try 3125. Works for me.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
With all due respect everything you need to calculate the settings is in the 1st post- this thread is about providing people with a way to trade without relying on one person for data - having said that I use length 6250 or 3125 with baseline 1500. - thanks bobha!! EDIT - I've post XAU/USD levels in the 1st post.

Has anyone read pipEASY's - Building an equity millipede thread? I read it sometime ago and it had a large impact on my profitability. I was doing my journal the other day and a few things started to come together in my mind and has given me an alternative method for trading Pure &amp; Simple. I STRONGLY suggest you take a look at the thread and spend a couple of days reading the attached - it may just be a light bulb moment for you (it's amazing how long it can take to see that 2+2=4). Read it all don't stop until you get to at least page 136 of the PDF. PS For the lazy who want everything done for them - this will not be spoon fed. pipEASY spent a huge amount of time explaining his strategy, and I am not going to try and repeat it.

Dear HOLLOWHEAR , Thanks for 6250 and 3125,... I will do my best to learn more and try to get pips from GOLD,...buy why you place 1500 as a BASE LINE ? The BLUE line in the MM seen 1250 as a baseline,.... can you just explain whats the main different ? Thanks, Budi D

--- 帖子 #319 ---
On my chart - the Dark Blue line (MM level 4/8) is on 1500, the light blue line is 1250 (MM level 0/8). Either is fine and it won't make any difference really.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
HH, i was just wondering how you calculate the baseline (blue line 4/8) ? Did you use a specific level that seems to be the most frequent Support or resistance ?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
It's all in the first post and the PM I replied to. Steve

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks for that HH

Hi Hollowhead, Did u try to back test the EA with this system? As I do not have idea how to backtest with the rules u hv in this thread, Could you guide me to back test the EA with 122 pips range? Thanks

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Dear HH, One last thing,....I know that you like H4 TF very much,...I like it too,... The last I need to ask you, for the LENGHT, did you always use 1:1 to every MM 100% line ? For example you will use Lenght 122 pips for NZDUSD even in H4 TF ? While you use Lenght 244 pips for GBPUSD in H4 TF ? Please kindly explain to me,..... Thanks, Budi Dharma

I have started backtesting with quite a few variations - results are mixed depending on the pair and time period I choose, but nothing has stuck out to me. This is not exactly suprising though.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
1:1 is what I favour at the moment, but I am also looking at combining 122 and 156 with pipEASY's millipede approach outlined in in his thread and the PDF I posted yesterday. But I don't think many traders will have the stomach or patience for it

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I don't really know anything about the techinical side of EAs etc, but it might be that your MT4 has not got the complete data for pair you are testing. You could try downloading the data again and trying it once more.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
I would also wanna to backtest the system. Do I have to adjust the variation before i start using the strategy tester to backtest? I am sorry but could you give me some guidience or procedure for me to do backtest with the EA?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
first what currency pair you are attached that EA IF EUR USD YOU NEED TO CHANG from BaseLine=1.26953 to Baseline - 1.31836 for that the EA GIVE YOU unmatched data error (THAT WHAT I THINK MAYBE NOT) I DONT USE EA

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Paulus has made the EA very flexible. When in the strategy tester click Expert Properties, then change the fields to what you want, ie where price needs to have come from (Start) where it finishes (This is actually your entry point, TP, SL, BE (0 if you don't have one), you need to do that for both buys and sells, then enter the length and baseline. With some trial and error it is quite simple.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
OK i will try. How the results of EA testing with different variation? Can u share some of the results to us? As you said the EA did not show u any surprise, is that still profitable after you backtest? Thanks

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Maybe I just so stupid, but I really dont know how to input the value into the boxes as there are really a lot value to input, Do you mind to show me how to input the value as the system stated on the first page? I will be appreciated!!!! Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image Attached Image

OK - below screenshots are for Long - price comes for 76.4% breaks 23.6% by 5 pips, with a 125pip TP (that's about the upper 76% level) and SL 75 pips (which is just below the 100%) Short - price comes for 23.6% breaks 76.4% by 5 pips (note it is "-5"), with a 125pip TP (that's about the upper 76% level) and SL 75 pips (which is just below the 100%).

Thank you very much Steve! I did some backtest this afternoon and the results seemed not very encouraging as the result shows not profitability with the system. I use 122 as the length but EUR/USD just dont seem to be the pair to trade with the system. And even recently i am having positive result on forward testing but the past result just dont support it. Btw hows ur result with the backtesting? which pairs or length is the best at the moment? I am encouraging ppl to use martingale but seems this system should be trading with hedging strat or martingale cant just trade standalone as the phases seperate price equally and thats more or less close to grid trading. Anyway I would love to hear some ideas from you!

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Like you I've yet to find the right combination of levels and rules that are universally profitable (and I suspect they don't exist) Like any system - and I mean ANY system, this will be profitable in some environments, and an account killer in others. So picking pairs, and environments is key. Knowing when to trade and when to stay out is important. I hedge a lot, but it is not easy but it takes a high level of patience, discipline and confidence to unlock hedges. As far as martingale goes, I would never encourage anyone down that route - if the system can only be profitable with martingale, then it is not a good system. One other way to trade this is as described by pipEasy's Building an equity millipede.

I find the number 515 an interesting number.. 5 by 103.. will be looking to short the Dragon.. next week based on this number also 680 and 1130..just my thinking of course.. I think he uses it a LOT of different ways besides the way he laid down.. just my thoughts like I said..

For those interested you might want to try this EA test Pick a pair Pick a year long period to test over Use length 66 for length (78 for JPY pairs) Use this years baseline if you can't be bothered to work out the MM levels for your period. Enter any trade criteria on the EA (I used break of 100% (with price coming from 76.4%/23.6%), SL 33 pips. Do 5 tests - with the following TP 33pips (RR 1:1) 66pips (RR 1:2) 99pips (RR 1:3) 132pips (RR 1:4) 165pips (RR 1:5) Compare the declining win rate with the profitability.

Here's what is likely to happen.. 1. Only a few people will look at this (a set of reports is not as interesting as a colourful new indicator!!) 2. Of those that look into it, some will 'see' what it actually means 3. Of those only a few will incorporate the principle into their trading. 4. Only a handful will have the patience and emotional stability to see it through to profit - and they will never look back. BUT - contained here is what I believe is the most simple, fundamental, universal and dependable trading truth... it's always been there to see, we have all read about it in one way or another, but still we search for 'another key/secret'.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
nice job steve! i got a few questions here tho. why did u choose the period of 2010 to backtest but not the last three years? and did u try to use the baseline where u get from MM level to backtest with profitable result? and what about other pairs? once again, nice job!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi - no reason - I just picked a period of time at random. I did the same year with USA/CAD, it was not profitable on RR1:5, but was with RR1:3. I've done GJ the following year (again no reason other than it was a different year). Length 79, this years baseline, SL 38, RR-1:5 - almost doubled the equity. The point is - cutting losers short and letting the profits run (I know we've heard it all before) Sure there will be average or even losing years, BUT, when you hit a trend (which is inevitable eventually) then it more than pays off, and trading multiple pairs means the good ones in any given year will outperform the average ones by a mile. Just think what the profit would be with compounding. So I am thinking I will forward test with something like the following Enter two trades 1% each. Trade 1 goes for 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5 (decision will be based on the typical range of the pair - ie GU, GJ, EJ will be 1:4-5, USD/CAD, EG will be 1:3) Trade 2 will be left open and will build an equity millipede. SL will be the same and moved to BE when Trade 1 takes profit. So, Trade 1 will slowly build the account and keep the equity curve rising. Trade 2 will build for positions trading, exits will be based on a change in the weekly/monthly trend. They will be diversified as described in the millipede thread (I posted link a few days back)

Quite a system he has here - why are you guys ruining it with MML's? The underlying concept he is expressing in this system is VERY worth the study to understand and learn well. It's a concept that can transform your trading if you'll allow it. I've been on a "quest" similar to this methodology for a few years and have finally gotten to a point I'm trading based on what the OP of this system has presented. I'm HAPPY to see someone else on a similar endeavor!!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Very nice system. Hollow, thanks for sharing it. I've been trading with the system for a week and seeing some good results, so I thought I would post something. One comment I would make is to modify the Abonacci indicator to automatically determine the baseline and the length. Since those numbers are based on Murrey Math, it could be done and make the setup much easier.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Another quick question HH - do you use the baseline as what you have listed on the first page or do you put the baseline that is current at the moment ? So say you open a new chart and add the baseline into the indicator at its current price or what you have listed for all the pairs on page 1 ? Thanks in advance !

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hiya noob - I use the baseline on the first page - they are matched to the MM levels at the begining of the year. Steve

--- 帖子 #353 ---
dear hollowhead.. sorry for my basic question. in your 1st page the baseline for eur/usd is 5 digit. And my broker use 4 digit. So my question is, does the base line in the 1st page for eur/usd is valid for 4 digit broker..? sorry for my english. regards

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi SemraR82 - sorry I missed your post earlier - I would presume you can just lose the last digit. So, EU would be 1.3183, having siad that I've never traded with a 4 digit broker, so I'm guessing.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
i'm glad to see you here again and many thank's for explanation. I think EU is still heading down. Btw do you still use abbonacci template that bobbi has provide..? If does then wich template do you use...?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi ya - thanks. I'm always floating around. Yes I am still using bobi's templates. I am primarily using the the longterm targets to set a bias and then stacking trades towards those targets. PS - BTW I am expecting EU to continue down to 1.3398 - no lower.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi, I have just PM you, please see your inbox. I wait for your comment on that. And sorry if my message to you is out of the topic. Hope you can understand. Regards

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Hollowhead Really very interesting and simply one. I am bobi fan. I had saw this thread last week. Please tell me anybody can using this system and how many pips getting per month ? regards

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi prraj Yes anyone with a trading account can use what's outlined in this thread. How many pips per month is impossible to say - it has too many variables. What is outlined here is not so much a system as an approach. How many pips someone achieves depends on which pairs they trade and when, whether those pairs are trending and how volatile they are, how they choose to play the levels, whether they use a SL or hedge, whether they keep trades open, whether they make multiple entries etc, etc, etc, Trade safe Steve

Hi all Anyone knows the baseline for JUNE on EURUSD and GOLD? Ive been trading using Left Brain Trading and its smiliar method, however i can see that the baseline in abonacci is variable were in Leftbrain trading its fixed to a local base no eg. ( eurusd 1.20) Good Luck all

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I'm sorry JiaYik, I don't have time to write a PDF - everything is here on the thread and its only 19 pages. Personally, I have read threads (Equity millipede for one) that are over 300 pages long more than once, word for word - I mean read, study, understand, test, go back, read again, test again. I suspect every trader has done the same, whether on FF or a book or just studying charts. Without be brutal, no trader will make it in the long run replicating another traders system - its one of the reasons I have gone quiet on this and the abonacci thread. We all have to find out own way (and I am finding mine). There is no one size fits all. We can learn principles, possibilities and lessons from each other (which is what this thread is about). We can challenge and push each other, but we each have a path to walk and we must find our own way - this trading method will suit some, but for others it just won't work. It's like trying on clothes, they look great on some people, but someone else can look stupid in the same outfit - it just doesn't work...

what should I open here . buy or sell . can you please explain about entry and exit point of h4 chart trading

--- 帖子 #368 ---
IMO based on the rules on page 1 - the price came from lower phase 76.4 and has hit 23.6 so the valid trade would be long with a TP at 76.4 level of this current phase.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi Hasib - Tom is correct, if you are following the trend (which is bullish), and price has come from the 76.4% level in the phase below, then the valid trade would be long.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
256 is how far back the MM math calculation shosuld be based from (ie a year's trading days) 1440 - dictates the length - 1440 min (the daily timeframe)

Hi Guys, I'm having a problem seeing the indis onto my chart. I put the following into the MQL Indi section : Abonnacci Template Manual v7 ex.4, MM Line x enq.ex4, MM line x enq.mq4 and the Pure &amp; Simple v2 tpl into the template folder. I can only find one of the MM line indis in the indi section of my mt4 and nothing else, no template as well. Have I done something wrong? Can someone please show me how to correct this. Thank you.. hi hollowhead , Great to see you have your own thread going in regards to Aebabs work..only discovered it now. Thank you for simplifying his system and having just one template. Also a BIG thank you for you time and effort in wanting to educate us and also for sharing your knowledge with us. Take care and happy trading.

Hi - thanks for your post. You will only see one MM indi - the two versions are the same indi (one is an editable version). Make sure you put the template file in the template folder, not the imdi folder. Cheers Steve

Hy hallowhead.Very interesting thread.I'm interested in GBP/NZD pair.Could you provide me the baseline? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
The baseline for GBP/NZD is 1.95313 - Sorry for delay. I find the easiest way to set the baseline is to 1. load the pure &amp; simple template. You will see the Murray Math lines - locate the dark blue line - the number that corresponds to this line is the baseline.

Hi everyone! I came across this very interesting method just earlier today. Read the basic method of how to trade it and gave it a shot! The result...all three trades ended up with small profits! Not bad. I'm going to delve into this method more and will let you guys know how it goes Below is just one of the trades that I've taken. Notice that I've entered a bit late I was supposed to enter after price broke through the 23.6 level. But anyways...

does anyone have any experience in daytrading this method?

thanks hollowhead but i have a problem with the system i want to run this system for stocks how can i calculate the length? sometimes the price is big and sometimes the price is small and using the same length makes a problem about the phase. please help me

thank you very much

sorry im stil confusing about baseline.it diffrent in diffrent TF.say it USDJPY it 106.250 in 1H and it said 105.00 and u write and page one is 87.5 . how actually take baseline number exactly?

The baseline is the dark blue Murray Math Line no matter what timeframe you are on. Also remember to set the " length" to a different level based on timeframe. ie. 1 hour timeframe length is 122 4 hour timeframe length is 244 Read page 1 carefully and you will have it down.

in Page 1 it said for YEN pair is 156

--- 帖子 #366 ---
That's it - you got it. Good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
is this thread still alive? Hollowhead have you had any luck on this at all?.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
How do you about combining 122 and 156?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
HELLO EVERY ONE first i would like to appreciate you, Hollowhead , for your thread and efforts. I read almost all 20 pages and i think its great. I really appreciate if you could help me for following? 1- wandering if you have all baselines of euro/usd for each months that babbi have released before? i hope i can find relevance if you have recorded before. 2-and also if you could tell me the sizes that babbi have told you and how does he manage to calculate the sizes? many thanks in advance

Hello Hollowhead I use your trading pattern. I would like news about baseline and lenght to indices (DAX, CAC, FOOTSIE...). May you help me and give me some informations ? Thank you.

Nice One i'll follow

ok, i found this thread today and thought i play with this. I found that the indicator and template in post 1 were somewhat in need of change as the template opens with default date 2.1.2013 and then confusingly you need a different length for jpy and non-jpy pairs. I solved by modifying the date on the abbonaci indicator and then save it as pure and simple 2016nonjpy template with length 244 and then apply that template on a jpy pair change the length to 312 and save the template as pure and simple 2016jpy. I will need to do that once a year, not too much work. I would love a way to automaticly set the correct base-line value. But no mq4file

Hi Steve, Do you mind explaining a little bit more on the murreymath period, my chart which is AUDJPY today changing the length by itself. It was 61 pips yesterday, and today it became 78 pips. The rest of my pairs are all alright, they stay the same, only AUDJPY. What do you think? Cheers, green pips to you!

Thank you Hesron for your effort .. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
thanks boss , this version of indicator created 3 layer up and down of the baseline .... please can you kindly help to make it create more layers like 17 to 20 so the need to update the baseline will no longer be required as the trend progresses. ..... Thanks sir

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Interesting...do you still trade it?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Should not be totally sure, here has varied in some coins is strange. 244 for H1 and H4.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hello, this is very good, it would be nice to have mq4, so when it stops working, would you? A topic I've done that can help to make it confluence. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post11439965

Hi, excuse my English. I think I have found the answer to the baseline. Only one programmer needs to change the attached program. Example 2 January 2013 gbpusd. I'm not very good at math (sorry for my mathematics lol), so if you solve the problem better than I, put it there. The baseline is the fibonacci of the area 965 value, and the starting point is fibonacci of the daily candle of the first day of the year. What is the fibonacci of the candle of the day? Subitrai the high and low of the candle. 1.63379 - 1.62245 = 0.01134 What is the fibonacci of 0.01134? 0.01134 * 0.618 = 0.00700.812 Subitrai high by round result. 1.6337 - 0.007 = 16267 &gt;This is the fibonacci of the daily candle. Now what is the fibonacci of area 965, knowing that the starting point is 1.6267? 965*0.618= 596,37 and 965-596,37=368,63 and 368/100.000=0.0368 Added 0.0368. 1.6267 + 0.0368 = 1.6635 &gt; is the base line.

Fill in the script with 5 decimals the maximum and minimum of the first day of the year. I made a correction in the last post, but it still is not all correct, I have to review the accounts, but I made a script that has a very small error in 1 digit. I'll fix it later. Sorry I did not understand the purpose

--- 帖子 #322 ---
A new better version that calculates the fibonacci of the daily candle, perfectly. Look at the difference between the basiline of the program in pink below. Mine in green above. Less than 100 points difference. I noticed that this difference happened in other currencies as well. If you deduct 70 points you will hit almost exactly with the calculation of the Abonacci. I will not change that because I see no logic in this difference. It must even be insignificant for the trade, do not you think?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
A version for T4F template For another template, just change the code. example: model 220 * 0.618 = 135.96 In the code it is only to change in that format fim = f + 0.013696; In 2013 the basilne given by Abonacci was 1.3401 The calculation for this script was 1.3376 Difference of 25 points, if you want to take 20 points from others calculations will match almost exactly.

You are doing a lot of job. Hope you will earn money with this system. Note, that as far as I understand even thread starter do not use the system. I have spent few days some time ago trying to backtest the system manually with different settings and I was not able find any good edge in it finally. Good luck to you!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
The system of this topic that uses Murrey Math with Abonacci? I'm not using this, but pure Abonacci. What are you talking about? I met both of you this week. The fibonacci I use made a topic about, and it really is efficient, it's up to the same shape that works the xm signals. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post11439965

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I know the topic is abandoned, but uses suggestion similar to this theory is what calls fibonacci fractal In the post above I usually analyze this kind of thing.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
please am a newbie here but i think this system is awesome, i tried using it as pullback and it worked BUT HAS ANYONE USING THIS SYSTEM GOT RECENT UPDATE? I MEAN LIKE SYSTEM APPLIED OR THIS YEARS BASELINE PRICE HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU CHEERS

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Nice discovery. I have something for you regarding this. We can help each other. Please reply if you are still around.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
yes please am very much around just that for now am still trying to get used to the site on posting and replying threads

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Thank you Hesron.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Any news about this System, would like to hear some stories... Anyone tested/upgraded with EA based on this trading system?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi all it been a while, Has anyone heard from abbonacci in the last five years? I found a indicator that uses a baseline system and has time and price levels with a demo that work and is coming out with a pattern service but the release date keeps getting pushed back. I will say this, its a very hard to find web site but is you go to levelforecast dot abbreviation of the word communication you will see. Also, I never noticed before that the page one of this thread has the baselines, Abbonacci used to make an encrypted calculator to give use traders to use for one month but I have to say was very difficult to use. I am trying the Abonacci system with base levels, which the main level is for the EUR/USD 1.1878 , 1.2294 Daily chart and the H4 is 1.2294 - 1.2190, and the H1 is 1.2138 - 1.2086, the 30 is 1.2138 - 1.2112, the 15M is the same and the 5M is 1.2112 - 1.2125, and the M1 is 1.21315 - 1.2125. and here is the image of the H4, it has migrating trendlines which are really great and works on all the rates and the spot metals and the cryptos. I am not tryiong to sell it I am sharing it because uts hard to find and it works and it uses the base line idea. I really always liked Abbonacci system and pretty much figured out how to find a base line but never was apt enough to use the rules. I think it works and I am still really curious if the Abbonacci Man himself has a hand at the Levelforecast tool. any ways is there any new developments to this system ? thanks all, happy pipin well it wont let me upload, I dont know why. all i ever upload are Images. the Levelforecast is in some other postes I made.
