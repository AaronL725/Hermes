http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/8589/logo2tbo.jpg logo by Sequoia If a strategy is good a robot should be able to trade it successfully, Taking stress and impulsive and costly decisions out of the equation. We, here at Jiva Dragon, are thankful for automated systems of trading. Please do not use real money. This ea is still under development. Your feedback in testing is much appreciated. JIVA Dragon EA DSS T3MA testv14.2 mq4 For the series presently under development we use the 15 min time frame and only a few of the many functions available. The basic structure: For long entry: a candle closes below the channel high, the next candle closes above the channel hi, ea will place an order at the close of the 2nd candle. The order can be instant or pending. All the settings are adjustable. 1. how many pips away the pending order is to be placed. 2. how long the pending order will be valid (in terms of candles). 3. what the channel value is. Robby Bressert dss indicator (a graphic variation of a regular stochastic) is used to confirm a long or short entry, a variety of moving averages can be used as desired even on multi-time frames to ensure trades are only taken in the direction of a main trend, macd with a multi time frame option has been added to v14.1. Two orders are opened on a given signal. The trade is managed in this way. To limit losses: A stop loss can be set for both positions to limit losses should the entry be bad. To capture gains: Trailing stop losses can be set for both positions. Limits can be set for both positions. If the 1st position reaches the profit target, the ea places a stop at break even for the 2nd position. If the 2nd position fails to reach a profit target that may have been set for it and falls back, it stops out at break even for 0 gain/0 loss. If the 2nd position reaches it's profit target, then there is gain for both positions. If the profit target for the 2nd position is very great, say for example 300 pips because we want to try to catch a big move, then the 2nd position may close if it reaches 300 pips or it may close if a candle closes outside the channel in the opposite direction. It may also close if a trailing stop has been set and it retraces back to be stopped out. Lot's going on. Busy little ea... The Robby DSS Bressert is a stochastic displayed with dots rather than as lines. I like it because it shows %D and %K crosses nicely as dot color changes. Easy to see as the dots are correlated with candle closings. Many, many thanks many times over to Taiyakixz who is so very talented and is putting so much time and thought into building the different versions of this robot. Since the first page is the only page in the thread that can be edited in definitely, We will post the updated setting for the ea as well as post any updated versions of the ea itself or any links with update info on this page. So please check back regularly. It can be helpful for those wishing to use this expert adviser that they use a remote desktop vps service. The remote desktop remains up and running 24/7 even when the trader's personal computer is turned off. You will need to put the Robby Bressert dss indicator and the T3MA indicator in the mt4 indicator folder for the ea to load properly. The templates included in the zip files for v14.2 use a custom macd indicator that you will need to download for the templates in order to follow along visually however this macd indi does not affect the functioning of the ea. It is just a visual preference. If you are new to expert advisers, backtesting, optimizing, etc... please visit Geoff65's thread. He has done an excellent job of presenting so much useful information for those who may just be starting. By familiarizing oneself with some of the basic information he presents there it will be easier to keep the dialog on this thread focused on the ongoing development of this ea without the necessity of explaining some of the very basic steps in getting started with ea's in general and being asked the same basic questions over and over again. So please refer to http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 . Thank you Geoff... If you cannot find the answers there please feel free to send me a private message. Good luck. Note about the differences in results that occur due to different brokers: the forex market is over the counter so there is no central clearing for trades. As a result there are slight differences, and sometimes not so slight differences (as in fast moving markets, news releases etc.) in prices. Therefore it necessary for each trader to see what minor changes need to be made in the settings to achieve optimal results. Sometimes changing a channel setting by a few points can make all the difference in the world. It is very individual. The settings in this thread are tuned to FXDD, malta. Fixed spreads . We will be adjusting settings for Alpari, UK over the next few days but we cannot do this for all the brokers. Best way for individual traders to adjust settings for their specific broker is to use the optimizing function in the tester. Backtesting on the weekends using a broker with variable spreads is useless. Because the spreads are variable the testing must be done when the market is open. PLEASE NOTE : 1. We have abandoned the original 4hour series. 4hour candles form differently for different brokers' gmt which makes it difficult to work together to compare trades and ideas. We are now trading the 15 min charts. 2. Check back here regularly since we will post the links that have the most recently updated settings. 3. The settings and .ex4 file for v11 which has been phased out are archived here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=845 As of 10/30/10 we are also now including a "50/50 statistical edge test". We leave all settings the same except for the stop loss and take profits. They are set equal to each other. If there is a better than 50% win rate, preferably 65% or better, rare but very desirable, then we know we are optimizing and not simply fitting a curve by adjusting settings. Many thanks to jm2110 for his in-depth critiques which have lead to us adopting this very valuable tool. Traders, please keep posting your comments, insights, criticisms, questions, etc.. Thank you in advance.... 3. The offset option will need to be set according to each individual broker. The tests were run using FXDD Malta so the setting in the set file is +3, but different brokers have different gmt offsets. For instance Alpari UK the setting would be +2. And this may change with daylight savings. At present we are making 2 small modifications: 1. close at true break even (no loss due to spread fee) 2. more sensitive to moving average slope experimental moving average indicator created by Taiyakixz posted here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=854 Please feel free to test and experiment. To access 99% modeling quality follow the instructions on this website: http://eareview.net/tick-data Update: 11/14/10 FXDD and Alpari tested the same... We will be testing set files posted here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=4176762&amp;postcount=857

Note about backtesting: Back testing in the mt4 tester is fraught with difficulties. The data may or may not be correct. Refreshing a chart may or may not help. But it is all we have at present to try to test a strategy historically. It is very helpful to be aware of the shortcomings of the mt4 tester. For examples of these discrepancies and how they can and do affect results. Please see post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=282 and http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=292

As of now 8/11/10 we have 7 optimized settings for the Jiva Dragon set up on 7 different pairs. The goal for this series is at least 10 settings all running simultaneously 24/7. Each setting has shown to trade 2 to 3 times per month and the average for 2 positions per trade about 40 pips total. 10 settings x 2 trades x 40 pips = 800 pips per month. If my math is right. For the last 5 days there have been 5 trades all winning. Respectively in order these are the backtester graphs at 90% for 12 months prior: EURUSD USDJPY AUDUSD EURJPY CHFJPY USDCAD EURCHF The presets are posted on the 1st page.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Awesome work, Jiva.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks for the kudos.. I nearly drove Taiyakixz to jump off a bridge... The credit goes to him just for being able to deal with me.. Not to even mention his very meticulous coding.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
These settings trade on an average a few times/month each. So this not the kind of trading that will have someone sitting on the edge of their chair glued to a monitor with baited breath for hours on end!! But add it up at the end of the month and it is very nice. Set it and forget it.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks a lot for sharing this precious gem. Does the EA work in any TF or only H4? Cheers

--- 帖子 #8 ---
The dragon is very versatile. These particular settings are optimized for h4. That does not rule out other settings for other time frames. USDJPY is set for 30m time frame. I am at present focused on the goal of at least 10 settings for this series. I have found a 2ema hi lo channel to be very helpful on the 4hr for finding 2 candle breakouts. The time frame can be set to anything and the channel can be set to anything, 200ema! It may be possible to capture big moves off a close outside of the 200 ema. 400 or even 500 pips or more, why not. If the 2nd position is not limited to 30 or 40 pips but given room to run and say a limit of 1000, with a trailing stop of 200... There are all kinds of thing that can be done with this ea. Let your creative energies flow. It is exacting work to find the settings. But they are there. And this ea has fabulous features.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
ea opened 4 pending orders which if filled would be 2 positions each. I don't have enough margin in this micro account to carry all those trades. I had to close 1 pending. When EURCHF was filled close it early for a small profit. So I could carry the EURUSD positions. and wait for the USDCAD pending to fill.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
The trades so far +96 pips total for this morning

--- 帖子 #11 ---
It looks like it won't work, as is. with 5 digit brokers. Will it if the pip values, in the parameters, are increased x10?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
The ea is coded in such a way as to normalize price quotes for 4 or 5 pip brokers. Try it in a demo for 5 pips. My broker is FXDD and they are changing over from 4 pips to 5 pips. Their demos are all 5 pips now and no problem with running the ea in those 5 pip demos. Their live accounts switch over in a couple of days. I don't anticipate this to be a problem. The account I am using for testing this forward is a micro account. It is 4 pips live now but will change over in a few days to 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Yes, I found that out since posting. Thank you for the reply This looks good. You put a tremendous amount of work into it.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Jiva and Taiyakixz Thanks a lot for all the work. Your persistence is paying off. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
You're welcome. Let's make some $$$$

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Just a reminder. These are very slow settings. http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...5NCZZl5Roy_7o= On a very active day in the market they may all try to place pending orders together. http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...CZsOZiGy5u7IQ= At other times when the market is slow there will be nothing. Maybe for several days in a row. These settings are all part of the same series. I know this ea can do other things. We will be seeing how to utilize. v8.0 is under testing. It will be able to place instant orders as well as pending orders.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Very thorough work. I look forward to testing.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Go for it.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
AUDUSD just triggered a sell stop. The settings call for a pending order to be place 55 pips away and the pair has three 4hour candles to reach the pending order. See what I mean about slow!!! If the pending order is filled it will place 2 positions 1st limit 15 and 2nd limit 50. Okay, took a little nap. Woke up and there it was. The pending was filled and the trade was good. Only thing is why only 1 position was opened. Should have opened 2. This happened the other day with EURCHF also. If it is my quirky broker FXDD Malta or the ea somehow needs something. Taikixz says he can't find anything in the code that would cause this. I have no error messages in the journal. It just appears the ea did not even try to open the 2nd position. It would not have reached the limit anyway for this trade. But sometimes it might. The 2nd limit is 50 pips...

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Jiva! Thanks so much to you and Taiyakixz for share with us this excelent work. I want to ask you if we have change the gmtoffset on the settings or we have let it like that . Thank you, again. Gisela

--- 帖子 #22 ---
GO Jiva so jpy 30m and all else 4H?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
fxdd is gmt+3 ... we need to adjust if we have alpari for example or ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Go to the parameters screen of the EA and click on "Load". It should should show you the "presets" folder. Select the pair and hit "Open". That will load the parameters for your pair.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Yes, if Alapri isn't GMT +3. I don't know what it is.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 alpari uk is gmt+2

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi guys I think the posted EURCHF settings are not right. The set file has start as 0 and end as 24. All others have start is 1 and end is 24. With the start hour as zero, the display on the terminal then shows start and end hour as the same and the message then it says, "Not Trade Hour". (I think it thinks that it starts and stops at the same moment, and the rest of the day is not for trading.) I have solved the EURCHF issue by changing the start to 1 to bring it in line with the other set files. I hope this helps. Invisible

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thank you, let's make some money.... gmt offset is only important if you want to designate trading times. For these settings we are looking to trade 24/7. In the comments it will say "not trade hour" if start hour is set to 0, but it is just a bug in the comment not in the ea itself. We can ask Taiyakixz to fix this.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
That's it. So far so good.. 9980776543200

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I always put the gmt offset in anyway. Force of habit. But it is only needed if you want to designate trading times.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
and usdcad?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
see http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=29

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Note: The basic template is the same for all the settings in this series but there are some variations. Check the settings for each pair. Most use the 2 ema channel. USDJPY uses a 55 ema channel. So for viewing that would need to be changed from 2 ema hi lo to 55 ema hi lo. For other pairs there are also slight variations, check the settings. For viewing some adjustments will need to be made. This does not affect the operation of the ea. But just for viewing. For example CHFJPY uses a 21sma as well as the 400 T3MA, So for viewing a 21 sma will need to be attached to the chart. So to follow along by viewing check the settings and add or delete indicators or make adjustments as necessary to agree with the particular settings.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
sorry, "NOT TRADE HOUR" message when start hour=end hour is the bug, but ea trades. It will be fixed the next uploaded version.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hello sir Jiva......i want to know where i can paste your v4.1 presets(SET file) into my MT4.....it's metatrader ikofx-expert-files............like we copy paste the EA???

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Download the presets unzip them open experts folder put in preset folder. attach ea to chart open settings click load the preset settings should be listed there.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
OK sir....Thank's.....you so helpful....

--- 帖子 #38 ---
updated preset for EURCHF. 2 candle expiration dss stoch settings 24, 35.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thank you Jiva and Taiyakixz...appreciated and testing!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thank's sir and Taiyakixz..... can i put 0 to GMT OFFSET to your EA because i do not know exactly my broker GMT.....my broker it's ikofx.....anyone know what are they GMT?? Thank's again for the help.....

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Contact your broker. They may have online chat, or email them, call them whatever. They can tell you for sure. If you want to trade 24/7 you don't need to know if you put 0 for start hour and 24 for end hour. The message will say "not trade hour", but that is just a bug in the message not in the ea. The ea will trade anyway, no matter the message says "not trade hour"...

--- 帖子 #43 ---
OK sir.....i understand......Thank's again .....i think i should EA work 24/7 alone.....maybe only this i can know how your EA work with my broker

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Couple of questions: 1. There is no 21 sma in the set file for CHFJPY, that I can see. I've looked a couple of times. 2. How are the T3MA and/or the sma used? Price above or below? Slope? 3. How is the stochastic used? Are we looking only for red or green dots at the point of entrance? Does overbought and oversold play into it? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
If anyone else was set up for London open, EURCHF triggered again, really active this month, 4 trades already.. the 1st tgt was hit =15 pips, now the stop has moved above breakeven to trail at 20 pips with a limit set at 50. I updated settings for EURCHF once and posted the updated setting for 2 candle expiration instead of 1. this new setting which I will post makes a trailing stop of 20 for 2nd position and a limit of 50. Everything else is the same, this just optimized further the total profit over the last 12 months. Okay we didn't get the 50 pips for the 2nd position, it fell back to 7 pips and stopped out... We'll take it, thank you.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
In answer to #1: Settings allows use of several different types of moving averages. they are coded to match the codes in mt4 indicators. sma is 0, ema is 2 etc.. will get back to #2 and #3 later, kind of tied up right now.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The 21 sma is not in the current set file for CHF/JPY. MA1 is set to "False" Here is a screenshot.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Which pair are you looking at? CHFJPY or USDJPY. They have different settings. They are supposed to have different settings.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I was showing USD/JPY. My mistake. I just looked at CHF/JPY and it is the same. MAI="False" I will post the screenshots if you need them.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
In answer to #2: slope only at this point.. In answer to #3: yes red or green for the candle that closes outside the channel.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I edited my previous post to show the CHFJPY set file. No MA1.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
oh boy. The guns are loaded. There's five settings that could trigger. 12 minutes till the 4hr candle closes. EURCHF already traded once this morning, getting ready to set up again.. Has anyone been able to get set up? Should practice with this on a demo before going live. Wow all five of them backed off at the last minute. closed inside the channel. EURCHF closed outside but the previous candle closed outside the channel. A signal is generated only when a candle closes inside and then the next one closes outside.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I'll check it out. There definitely needs to be a 21 sma. Thank you. These things have to be very precise. Appreciate your scrutiny. http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...45-ycOFhRCgVg=

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Slipped through the cracks somehow. Have corrected the set file in v4.1 presets page 1. Here is the corrected set file for CHFJPY. Thanks. Stick around we need someone who can find these things.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
In the constant battle against inaccuracies in the tester (and elsewhere) I have noticed: Running the tester in a demo gives distinctly different results than running the tester in a live account. Even downloading from history in both the demo and the live account still is not somehow the same data. Maybe it has something to do with the data centers. Brokers keeping live account data centers more up to date. At least this is definitely the case with FXDD. Moral of the story. Run tester in live account only....

--- 帖子 #56 ---
v8.0 will be posted shortly. v8.0 has the capability to open 2 trades instantly with pending = 0 and the comment bug has been fixed for "trader hour" The presets are being further optimized some going back 2 years. presets for v4.1 will work in v8.0 exactly as they did for v4.1. New presets will be posted with the optimizations for v8.0 as soon as they are ready.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
have all 7 loaded last night. let me know when you get a trade so I can compare, none here. so all thoses ma settings should say false?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Jiva see you are here now is the other ea I was testing for you on dead?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
slow day today. EURCHF triggered around London. But that was it. ma settings are there for different pairs. Some have and some do not. Please be sure to check the settings for individual pairs, all the settings are slightly different if you want to follow on a chart. there was an important update for CHFJPY so be sure to download the latest preset for that pair. I keep the presets updated fairly regularly and will make a note in the "reason for editing" box on the 1st page. link for updated CHFJPY preset: http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...5&amp;d=1281618836 This ea is good at catching big moves, but that usually means a lot of pairs are moving at the same time on news or whatever, so they can all fire at once. Watch margin... 7 pairs times 2 positions each can be significant for drawdown as the pairs swing.... Of course if your testing on a demo, no problem.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
What version are you running? In one sense there really isn't a lot of different between the versions. The presets all work in any version. There are slight improvements. No major changes. Always best to stay updated. v4.1 is posted now, but v8.0 will come out soon. Both are good for testing. No problem. If you are using any of the version 7 series, better not to. I know it is pain in the butt, to keep loading and reloading versions and presets. what can be done? A necessary evil. We will get to some point where the updating won't be so frequent, but I have feeling updating is something that isn't going to go away.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Those 30min preset I did were v5 so it should work in v4 so working on it now

--- 帖子 #62 ---
yes they should work..

--- 帖子 #63 ---
testing now will let you know

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi jiva My compliments on this thread, very interesting! Not only have you posted set files(a rarity in EA threads for some reason), also the code. Will follow along with interest and start testing at Sunday open. If I am understanding correct, this is 24/7 system, so the user can expect carry trades over the weekend. Also, works with either 4 or 5 digit brokers, so ECN broker is not a problem. Cheers

--- 帖子 #65 ---
it seems everyone can set up charts but me. When I download the EA and other files they end with .php instead of .mq4. How can I get them extracted to load into MetaTrader4. Thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #66 ---
If you go to the top of this page, on the right side you will see the page numbers and to the right of that there is the number 25 with a paperclip. Click on that box and you should find all of the files that have been posted to this thread,. Hope this helps. Carol

--- 帖子 #67 ---
The tpl and presets loaded to MT4, but the EA and Robby indicator still end with .php and will not load to EA and ind folders. I tried to find software to convert to mq4 but no luck. Thanks again Paul

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It's an IE glitch, use FireFox

--- 帖子 #69 ---
rename it manually...its easy. ie: attachment.php - "whatever indicators name is.mq4" and it works a treat

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi jiva34 and Taiyakixz, Thank You for sharing your ea, I will download and give it a try, if I may. My broker is IBFX as of now , if I use the presets, I will just have to change the broker time, correct. IBFX I believe ,would be 0. Would there be any other setting except for tp and sl that I need to change? Thank Again fishman356

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Jiva, I would like to trade your system manually and have a question to the attached charts (all EUR/USD H4 time frame). Example 1 for going short : First candle closed inside the dragon, second candle outside the dragon, so we enter a sell order at the close of the second candle, right? This would be a losing trade though. Example 2 for going long : First candle closed inside the dragon, however its a bearish candle. Do we still enter a long trade since the next candle closed outside the dragon? Or do we go long only when both candles are bullish ? Example 3 for going long : Is the candle, where I placed the arrow, a valid candle that closed outside the dragon? I am not sure here. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Just one more question as regards the AUD/USD trade. Why didnt the sell trade trigger at the yellow line (close of the outside candle)?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Because the "pending pips" parameter for AUD/USD is 55 pips. That means it has to drop 55 pips from the close of the candle that closed outside the channel.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
yes carryover possible. However since it is a break out system and catches momentum moves, at least that is the idea, and the profit limits are not very great, the trades generally occur in the active market times and are completed fairly quickly, unless, of course, the inevitable not so hot trade... then it may carry over and take some drawdown too. I am testing some of these pairs now for 2 years back history tweaking a bit the settings and am finding still no losses. This is very encouraging because as we know market conditions change radically in 2 years time and for these settings to hold up so well we are delighted. Will post the results shortly.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
For these settings we are trading 24/7 so if start = 0 and end = 24 gmt is not an issue. The message in comments will say "not trade hour" just ignore it. That is bug in the message not in the ea. We have fixed that in v8.0 to be posted shortly.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
We do not use instant orders for these settings. We use buy stop and sell stop when a signal is generated. Each pair is fine tuned differently you can find the exact settings in the preset for that pair. This is not a typical scalping system. http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...pXqYWwCHHUwv8=

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The back testing has shown using a pending stop order is a safer entry. We are not looking at how much we didn't get, we are looking at how safe is the entry.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Seems like a lot doesn't it!! It is a lot!! But backtesting has shown given the conditions present that this is the safest way to enter.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
How's it going?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
2 x EURCHF trades taken so far. Both for profit. Good start. Will take a while demo testing to get enough trades to be comfortable trading live, but that is OK: If it is a good system, it will be worth it.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
This system requires patience.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Market is resting now, little bit of retracing getting ready for next big move, maybe next week. We are ready..

--- 帖子 #83 ---

A better way to post your settings is right click on the reports after tester has finished, save the report then copy and paste only the settings section onto the thread. Easier to read. There are a lot of problems with the tester. I want to ask you a few questions. 1. was the tester run in a demo or in a live account? 2. I see it is 90% modeling, did you download the data from metaquotes in the history section just before running the tester? 3. was this run during the week when the market is open or on the weekend when the market is closed? 4. who is the broker for the mt4 account? 5. Are there gaps and "blackholes" in the chart itself? you can see this by opening the chart after the tester is done and looking at the trades, especially the losing trades. 6. can you take screen shots of the losing trades and post them. Thank you for taking the time and effort to research. There are many difficulties involved in using the tester. Try running the test again but change the dss settings from 8,13 to 24,35...

Hi, Jiva This is my ODL real account. This account is in euros. When I tester the EA, it appears "ordersend failed with error 3". You can see in the image attached. What's the problem? Thanks.

Question for Taiyakixz...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
USDJPY setting up on 30m. Has 3 candles (1 and 1/2 hours) to reach the sell stop. Looks like maybe some significant movements in the markets even though it is Friday.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
What does it contain? Anything? I see 7 set files...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I refer to the zip file in message number 54 Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
cool looking backtests, how has live trading been going?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Stops and limits cannot be attached to a market order. They must be placed separately in my broker (ODL MT4). Can it be the problem?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
There's a way to get around that, I believe. Maybe Taiyakixz knows. Makes life difficult doesn't it?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
up 150 pips since 8 days. Most of that was on Fed day.

whoa... just like yesterday. Everyone setting up just before US data release. 4h candle closes in 1 hour, data release in 1/2 hour. could be a full house.... Or like yesterday everyone flattened out and no signals... We want to be set up and ready.. just in case...

--- 帖子 #99 ---
flat The ea is disciplined... No trade. No signals. No trade. When the market moves the ea is all over it. No movement, no signals. No trade. That's why I want the ea to trade.

Hi, I ran a back test on eur usd back from june 1 to today and the results were impressive, the ea made over $5,000. with one loss of $5.94, I am now running a test from may 2009 , the ea is at dec 11 2009 so far it has taken two dd , but is still very profitable with a profit of over $5,100.00 and this is just the first pair, the person who posted bad results, maybe the presets were wrong, I installed the wrong presets at first and had bad results. fishman356 ps jiva34, which pair trades the most? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #101 ---
EURUSD seems like the most active. But ya never know. Just depends if they trend or hang out in consolidation. EURCHF was in consolidation for at least 5 or 6 months last year, no trades in the tester. But within the last few days it has taken 4 trades all good. Who knows? So you're getting a little enthusiastic. On Fed Day I saw what this can do. If a pair has a move, the ea is all over it... If not the ea stands back. I can wait. and while I'm waiting I'm working on optimizing the settings. Adding a few filters here and there to already excellent settings. I'll post the improved settings as soon as they are ready. I want to test them out thoroughly. Looking for additional pairs. Etc. Twice I woke up to winning trades and profits. While I was asleep.

backtest with Alpari UK/Demo... USDJPY 30m, setting with 1st post(but changed start time to 0) 2009.09.01 - 2010.08.11 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I downloaded the historical data from history center, but some period data is missing....If I refresh the chart, data appears, but modelling quality is down.....Anyone know how to solve this...?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Apparently another difficulty which I have encountered is data can be different when tester is used in demo or when used in live account. Even when downloaded from history center. Different data banks, live or demo?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
great work guys! congratulations! its been a while since we have a final version!!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Missing a few teeth and bunches of hair, but somehow we're up and running. Seems to be promising. time will tell.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
This shows the kind of differences in results that are obtained when using the demo platform to run the tester and when using a live account platform to run the tester. Both had data downloaded from the history. Both show 90% modeling. Both used the same set file, the same version v4.1. Both used same time span. Same broker, FXDD. The same pair, EURUSD. Same same same. 1st graph demo platform 2nd graph live platform

--- 帖子 #108 ---
backtest with Alpari UK/Live... same setting as post 103 Attached Image (click to enlarge) but some period data is missing.....take care....

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Taiyakixz makes a good point: "Can you make the simple strategy for tuning parameters for the EA? As you know, backtest results are different by brokers, so the other members have to tune parameters to suit for their brokers. I tried to do backtest with your settings, but it's not so good as you. Even if I change some parameters to avoid losses, but some another losses appear, so at the moment I can't find good settings. The backtest with USDJPY 30m which I post to the thread is good, but the others have much difference from yours. Especially 4hr chart, chart is much different by brokers, because of timezone. Your broker is GMT+3, so your 4hr chart bars are 3-7GMT, 7-11GMT, 11-15GMT.... But my broker is GMT+2, so 4hr chart bars are 2-6GMT, 6-10GMT, 10-14GMT.... It causes difference, so I can't tune it by changing some pips from your settings. So, to use the EA, we have to know how to set good parameters. I know that it was not easy for you to find good parameters, but to make it usuful for many other members, I want you to make simple way to tune parameters." I will try to put something together maybe a "Guidelines for Tuning Parameters" manual. It will take a little time to get that together. I am by no means an expert on the subject and am basically learning as I go, but there are a few things I can try to share. For now I will continue to post any updated settings I may be using. The settings I am using are tuned to FXDD Malta. I chose FXDD Malta because they use a fixed spread which is very reasonable for the majors and have not had any issues with them. They are always helpful for any technical questions.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
v8.0 Trader hour comment has been fixed. Ea now has the ability to open instant orders when pending=0 v4.1 is still good. And any settings posted will work in either v4.1 or v8.0. Updated settings for EURUSD, EURCHF, AUDUSD. These settings are further optimized (FXDD). We will try to post a guidelines so that traders can optimize for their brokers. Evidently using the 4h time frame causes major differences in results from broker to broker. It may be that in the future we can trade another time frame. Perhaps the 1 hour so that settings will be more universally practical.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Helpful article about using the optimizer in mt4. http://www.easyexpertforex.com/backt...imization.html I don't generally use the optimizer. It takes a very long time. Much of the time I am working on a particular problem area rather than say results over a 1 yr period. So I am opening the charts and looking at individual problematic trades.

Spent some time working on this issue of 4hr candles forming differently for different gmt. What we are trying to do is catch what I think of as a "trajectory". That may or may not be the best word for it, but it what comes to my mind. Like when exiting the freeway. We have to catch the right trajectory, considering speed, slope, other traffic, direction etc, in order to exit on the ramp. So it is the trajectory we want to catch. Since nothing was working on the 4hr for Alpari, due to the difference in how the candles are formed ala gmt, just for a lark, as they say in the country side, I tried the settings used for the 4hr on the 1hr. (with a little tweak) And wow, there it was the same trajectory we were capturing in FXDD on the 4hr, was caught on the 1hr with Alpari. Here are the results: and the preset.

Will investigate if the 4h settings can be set on the 1hour charts for the other pairs also. The problem may just be the 4hr chart and how the candles are formed differently for different brokers.

Are all files in post #1 up to date? Subscribing

--- 帖子 #120 ---
One thing to consider is after such great consistent results for each of the 7 pairs over the last 12 months are things about to change? The settings hold up fairly well over 2 years, but there are losses between 08 and 09. Dragon took a trade short EURUSD Asian session. Am little nervous that maybe we are approaching a turning point in the market and the successes of the backtesting will no longer be useful for trading now. So we shall see. 100% success rate for these settings over the last 12 months. Bit of a drawdown at present. The same settings on the 1 hour would not have gone short. t3ma is up... Maybe there is enough resistance at r1 which also coincides with the pivot from yesterday to stop the upward move. yes, there was resistance, just let the ea trade. still hanging on, if this is bad trade it is the first in 12 months. 1/2 hour to US data release Empire manu, and 1 hour to TIC long term... not pretty. especially since I am pretty sure it was a perfect sell at the bottom and buy at the top all in one... It looks like the stop was right at the top... ouch..

--- 帖子 #121 ---
up to date for the 4hour as tested with FXDD Malta. We're thinking maybe a better time frame will be the 1hour. But for now that's where everything is , the 4hour.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
EURCHF setting up again. Traded once already in Asian session.. the sell stop is placed, that doesn't mean it will get filled. EURCHF has 2 4hr candles to reach the sell stop. My guess is it'll get filled... filled entered and exited...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
yes, what broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Sorry Taiyakixz , but the ordersenderror I mentioned in post 88 and 94, appears in v8.0. Thanks in advanced.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi Jiva, is v8 5 digits compatible, or we need to x10 the value settings? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
v8.0 is normalized for 4 or 5 digits. No problem there. What broker?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
What pair are you testing?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
EURUSD . The problem is TP=SL=price (see image attached) because they must be placed separately in my broker (ODL MT4). Stops and limits cannot be attached to a market order.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I Agree. D1 and H4 candles are not the same in all brokers. It depends on the country the broker is, but H1, M30,... are always the same, only different names (8 pm candle in London is 3 p.m candle in New York, but prices: hight, low, open, close are always the same).

--- 帖子 #130 ---
yes I see. v8.0 was released before Taiyakixz heard of the problem. I did not post v8.0 until just recently so it is not a surprise that this particular problem is not addressed in v8.0. Most likely Taiyakixz is working on fixing it. Yes we will be focusing on the 1 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Greay results for this new version, I have not back tested , but will shortly on IBFX, do you have a new template for this ea?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
GREAT RESULTS

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Not really. Pretty simple. the moving averages are all slightly different for the different pairs anyway so one template wouldn't really do it. Only thing is the huge stop loss. some settings 140 pips. If gain is 15 pips 1st limit and average about 20 pips 2nd limit that's total 35 pips gain versus possible 280 pips loss. Can't afford too many losses at that rate. Like 1 loss is 1 too many!! Took a loss this morning in the micro. I only allowed 1 position to open luckily. But it was 140 pips. that wiped out pretty much the gains for the whole week. Except for maybe 20 pips. Not pretty. Looks like the ea sold EURUSD at the bottom and closed at the top. Perfectly!! So all the backtesting in the world still does not give any guarantee, only a rough idea at best. I know there's a way to get the probability of success to favor the trader. We will keep at it. This is a good start. The basic strategy is good and the ea is written nicely. We will see how to get the risk down to more acceptable levels.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Those Error I'd bet due to that 5-digit brokers acting as ECN now, in that case Order (without SL/TP) must be send first and then Order can be modified with SL/TP, otherwise you will get error.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I have not fixed yet. Please wait v8.1....

okay, we will get this stop loss down to bearable amounts. So that taking the inevitable loss is not a crusher.... Something more like these settings for 1h EURUSD 30 pip stop loss...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I suggest you study just one pair. Become familiar with the settings and how the ea works. We want to transfer from 4 hour to 1 hour. Here is a setting for EURUSD you can practice with. We also want to reduce the stop losses. We are working on that. 140 pip stop is not realistic. The different pairs all have slightly different settings. EURUSD is good to practice with. The preset for EURUSD1h is loaded into the template so it should already be there when you download the template provided you have one of the volumes of dragon loaded in experts. Good luck.

Our coding specialist has done it again. The miracle man. v8.1 should fix the order send error for traders with brokers who do not allow stop and limits to be sent with an order. Which is dumb, really dumb, if you ask me.... I do not understand the reason or logic behind that except that it makes trading a million time more difficult than it already is.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
In the ongoing effort to reduce the stop losses we are getting good results. the charts are not as pretty as charts with huge stops losses, but the settings are a lot safer. To use a stop loss as large at 140 is like playing Russian roulette, at any time the big loss can come and wipe away the gains from several months, maybe even a whole year. In these new settings the idea is to capture large moves. While waiting in the market the ea will be taking what look like good entries. But some of them may not be good. If the stop loss is very small by comparison to the size of the sought after gain then the loss can be absorbed until the big move is captured. Stop loss here is 30 pips. Using the 1 hour chart for EURUSD these are the results of some of the first efforts. The first chart is taken over previous 24 months. The second chart is taken over previous 96 months. We need to take into consideration the broker fees which will of course eat into the overall gain. For the 2 year period there were 210 trades x $10 per lot = $2100. Total profit after losses = $18548 - $2100 = $16448 / 2 yrs = $8224/yr. So the actual increase per year is 82.24% for the previous 24 months. By the same calculations the return over the last 96 months was 36.18%. (2003 and 2006 were bad years). Over the long term those figures are hard to beat. The strategy holds up over time. In this sense the ea becomes a good investment.

Thanks. All trades OK. Yes, you are a miracle man.

It's a full force stop loss attack!! Interesting results with 21 channel and 30 pip stop loss. The template has the preset loaded into it. So it should just open when the template is opened.

Thanks Jiva for this system! got another little question.... when i have to start EA? does it matter when london opens or NY etc. or doesn't it matter when to start? s/l's are set automatically too? Sorry for my linguistic mistakes... I'm from germany and i'm working hard on my skills :- ) So -long.... Best regards Phanti!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
you're welcome start=0 end=24 for trading 24/7, which is what are doing. Otherwise if you want to limit when trades are opened you set according to your broker's gmt. Stop loss values can be set in the settings. This ea has a few different ways it uses stop losses. See page #1 for a description. Stop losses to limit losses and stop losses to lock in gains. Habt einen guten Tag

Jiva34 , please put your settings not in a zip mode . Thank you

--- 帖子 #152 ---
@ Gav, i wanted to post it for you, but at this forum it isn't allowed to post .set files. I guess that's why Jiva puts them in zip-files. Maybe you can try downloading it using the paperclip in the upper-right corner instead? Ok, should started the post with this first: THANK YOU guys for the work done so far. I've been following the tread a while and ready for testing with the arrival of version 8.1 because my broker ( FXCM ) also needs the tp/sl changed after the order send. I wanted to test it, but I get the following error: I am using version 8.1 with the latest setting Jiva provided here (21_30) Every tick mode, 1hr candles on the EURUSD. When using it with the olde v4.1usdjpy30mtp15tp35pe36ch55t3 400x3 on the USDJPY 30min. I get the same error. Any suggestions?

Working on getting the stop loss under control... Just can't tolerate 140 pip risk. It's all about entry. Good entry no need for large stop loss...Small stop loss can be hit no problem. A few small losses no big deal while waiting for a big move. That's the idea. Hallo vriend, Ik vond de Google Translator, beetje leuk ..

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Question for the nuts and bolts man, Taiyakixz will know.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
ummmm...error 147 means ERR_TRADE_EXPIRATION_DENIED. Would you please try attached EA and tell me the results? It doesn't set expired time with OrderSend, but OrderModify. I'm not sure that it solves the problem, but I want to see how it works. Thanks in advance. To other members: this file is for testing expiration. Don't use it for other purposes.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Mooi!! Dit niewe ding is geweldig! Ik houd van kleine SL's! Bedankt!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Dear Taiyakixz, We tried something like this before in v7 series. It seems to have gotten lost there in v7's. It will help identify a safe entry. So if we could try to modify v8.1 I think it would be a good idea. The v8 series is very nice, runs good. So I hope this doesn't "gum up the works" as they say. But here is the idea. A pending order needs to be deleted when a fresh signal appears because the pending order is no longer identifying a good entry if a fresh signal has appeared. The ea should now delete the old order and open the appropriate pending order based on the fresh signal. The chart illustrates the problem when a pending order remains open when a fresh signal appears and how it can block a good entry. ありがとうございます。

When you load the expert, you have to enable it to trade. Press F7, and in the normal tab, select "allow live trading" (without selecting manual authorisation) Also ensure that "expert advisor" in the upper workbar is on. There is somewhere a button called "Expert advisors" @Taiyakixz . I'll try the larger expiration candles later today or tomorrow. Kinda busy right now. But thanks for the effort so far.

This didn't help. Had expire candles on 10 and 100. No difference. Still the 147 error. Tried it without selecting a value for the trailing stops (set it to 0) still the same.... EDIT. Still trying. Now I get occasionally a 147 error and one of them seems to always be the first order. But i also get modification orders that do work. Strange. I'll try to figure out when it works and when it doesn't EDIT 2: Hmmm, now I also get order modify error 1 in the "testexpired2 EA". What does this error mean? I didn't get any 147errors anymore. (testexpired2 EA) and 10 ExpireCandles delay. Only played something with the tp /sl etc. settings. Strange. I'll do more testing later with different settings. I'm gonna try the normal version also. But busy these days, so it will take some time.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thank you for report. error 1 means no changed value with OrderModify. No error 147 with testexpired2 and 10 ExpireCanldes delay. So it seems that setting expiration must be done with OrderModify and expired time must be longer than certain period, but I'm not sure.... I will try to solve the problem. If you find anything, please tell me.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
There are so many difficulties in trying to get this right. A real obstacle course. Not just finding and staying with a good strategy but the other forces at work, like broker differences!! This is comparison of the same settings, same ea, same time frame,same same same back tests for a well established ea from another thread. Feel free to visit. There is so much useful information there. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 The first graph is the test on Alpari the 2nd is the same same same test on FXDD.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Presently we are patiently yet anxiously awaiting modifications. The modifications will make sure that a no longer valid pending order is closed as soon as there is a fresh signal and a new pending order will be opened for the new signal. The charts show the problem when an old signal remains open. It blocks a good entry. I am keeping some documentation of the trades using v8.1 in order to be able to compare the effects of the modification trade by trade. This modification should increase the results dramatically. In the ongoing battle to reduce stop losses. The settings for the EURUSD 15min and 30min tests use a 20 pips stop. My kind of stop.... With v8.2 and v8.3 modifications the winning trades we can capture should be far far greater than a few stopped out trades. We are looking at trades of 200 pips or 300 pips or more.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Please try v8.2. It deletes pending order by program instead of using OrderSend/OrderModify expiration. To other members: The modification of v8.2 is for the brokers which error 147 occurs. The strategy is not changed. v8.2 works on all brokers, but update is not needed if you have no problem with v8.0/v8.1.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I think that you use the word 'patient'. It is translated to 'a person who gets ill'.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Goodday, this seems to do the trick. No more 147 errors on this version. But I only ran a quick 2 month test. I did happen to see a But at this test I got a lousy 50% modelling quality. Will download tickdata and give it a few more tries on different pairs. Error 130 is an invalid stop error. Maybe there should be a (larger) delay between a buy/sell order and the modification order????? Good luck and hope that you guys can make an nice EA with the input of everybody here on this tread! Just don't get ill, but be patient........

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you for your time and effort. We want to make a very first class ea. I think we will do it. http://www.picturesof.net/_images/Si...436-917048.jpg Wij willen een veel geld te verdienen met zeer weinig risico...

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Thank you for being patient and testing. The error message which you post appeared with trailing stop or moving s/l to be. (If it occured at the fist setting s/l, the error message would be different 'Buy OrderModify 1(or 2) failed with error #130 StopLoss=....') One possible reason is that the spread is too large on weekend and s/l cannot be set with small trailing stop. MT4 tests all trades with the current spread. So if the spread is large now because of weekend, all trades are tested with large spread. Would you check the current spread and the parameter TrailingStop1/2? If these values are closed, error 130 occurs. In this case, try next Monday or use larger TrailingStop.....

try saving E/U as a template and load that template to the other pairs also make sure your expert advisor at the top of the mt4 program is on

Does anyone else get a "cannot load DSS ex4 file" (not exact) error message with this EA. Does the DSS need an ex4 file as well as the MQ4 file???

of course, maker sure you have spelled that correct, i mena the indicator's name, since it's under iCustom(), you have to point the exact name of the .ex4 file in the DSS_name variable

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hopefully that equity curve will smooth out with v8.3. But the difference between those original 4h settings and this 1hr setting is the stop loss. The 4hr settings had a 140 pip stop loss!!!! You should see the smooth equity curve you can get with a 1000 pip stop loss!!! Who will trade with such risk? Not me!!!

DRUM ROLL, PLEASE!!! Volume 9.0 is here!!! v9.0 is everything we had hoped and more.... How can we ever thank you enough, Taiyakixz??? Maybe if we all just make money nicely with v9.0 that will be just rewards!! Here are some preliminary results of back tests. I am up and running live micro just on these preliminaries alone. One thing to note is that the strategy for this ea is extremely simple. And the ea itself is very simple to set and use. I have noticed that in the past when I was getting off track and losing focus my charts and templates would become more and more complicated. So much so that I could hardly even see the price action any more. As if I could contain the movements of the market with all my lines and moving averages. As if they were ropes to bind the "dancing dragon" so to speak. The beauty of this is ea is it's simplicity. Something stressed over and over again by the master trader Geoff. Many Thanks to you, Geoff, for your professionalism... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 These test are on the 15 minute chart. They use a 30 pip stop loss and trades are only taken just before London open and for 4 hours after. We really wanted to get the stop loss down to something we could actually live with and 30 pips is a great relief. I will be running tests on the best times to initiate trades. This is always a hair puller since gmt and local times and market times and broker times are always all different from each other. We'll get it down. The first test is for 12 months prior and just for the heck of it I took it back 10 years prior. When I have tried to go back 10 years with any ea, not just this one, the results have always been dismal. So looky, looky!! Even going back 10 years the general move is up. (10 year results will be posted in the next post). What this tells me is that the basic algorithm is very generic. Perhaps different parameters for different pairs might yield a bit different results. But the basic algorithm is true in all market conditions. Now that is something.... This post shows the 12 months prior results. micro .01 lots... For GU and EU Alpari demo (generallly better to test on live account, I'm US resident so I can't open live account with Alapari, wish I could)

--- 帖子 #197 ---
This the 10 years prior results. We are not particularly interested in 10 years back, a lot can change in 10 years. But it is interesting to note. Same set file just 10 years instead of 12 months...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Jiva, I'm at a loss for words! Congratulations come first. I'm so happy for you. I'll try it right away! All your work is beyond description. s

--- 帖子 #199 ---
so this shows that some years can be bad, and others can be good. is that right?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Yes. What I take encouragement from is the overall trend is up for the ea. something I have not seen in any ea's I have tested as of yet. Not for 10 years. With a 30 pip stop loss!!! Of course let us not overlook that this is the famous back tester full of hidden bug a boos, that make it a very crude instrument for relying on with any reliability. All that said. The God's still have to bless.... In the previous post the graph for 10 yrs was from a set file that I did not have the correct gmt settings. The edit function is not any longer available for the post so I am posting the graphs of correct set files. These are 10yr test results using Alpari demo gmt +2. EU and GU

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Still researching which market times are best. So far 1 hour before US open and running for 3 hours is looking pretty good both for GU and EU. So we will have to deal with the gmt thing.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Again the differences in testing results for different brokers is quite pronounced. This is the same test. Same settings, Everything same. Only difference is brokers.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I think we're all programmed to that by now and those new ones who aren't, we surely will have the patience to help. Don't you think? I remember when I was a newbie. Still am, even after many years! This is really looking good. You've earned those vouchers!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Nice work Jiva and above all Taiyakixz!!! I'll test this one. But little time the few weeks. (busy @ work, vacation, etc) But I want to help you and the rest here to find nice settings when i've some spare time

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Great. Look forward to working with you to getting this set up nicely. The better we can refine the entries the more we can keep a small stop loss.

We need someone to clearly and simply write a guide to setting up the gmt trade time settings. My way of doing it is like using fingers and toes to count, not real good way to explain it to others. I get there eventually. Someone who can explain it, simple and clear, step by step and show an example of actually setting up according to a broker gmt. would be a real help. You know, gmt for dummies.... kindergarten first reader.....

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Not exactly... Gewoon een manier van spreken

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Jiva Guilty I am, of not loading the ea yet. Your write up for the recent V9 says test results were for 15m, yet the set file is named gbpusd 1hr verygood. Wondering? cheers

--- 帖子 #211 ---
v9.0 is working perfectly. When a new signal forms and old pendingorder is deleted and new pending order is opened. I am noticing a similar situation with an open position. The ea has a number of ways to close a position. One way to lock in a profit is when a candle closes out of the opposite site of the channel the ea will close the position if it is in profit. So for a long position that is in profit if a candle closes below the low of the channel the ea will close the position to realize the gain. This may very well be also a signal for a new pending order in the opposite direction. The chart shows the situation. so what we need is for the ea to close the position,realize the gain and also at the same time open a pending order based on the new signal. We can ask Taiyakixz if he can program this...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
It's named wrong.. The settings themselves are correct and are for 15 min. Thanks I will rename it... Test was using Alpari...

Ironing out the bugs... Dear Taiyakixz, Another pending related modification is going to be needed. The pending order seem to delete themselves when the trading day changes. They should remain open. The chart below shows the problem. candle expiration was set for 60 in order to catch entry into the breakout but the pending order deleted itself with the trading day.

ea opened 2 shorts. let's see... live micro FXDD a new sell stop has been placed just below the entry short based a on a fresh signal.... If the trade is bad it is 30 pip stop loss x 2 positions... The strategy behind the ea is to try to catch big moves out of consolidated areas 200, 300 pips or more. To be willing to accept a few small losses while trying.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
jiva, thanks for the updates dude.

You are very welcome Since you trying to define which time is the best for trading check out that Indicator "daily_open_line". Place it on H1 and on the Chart properties enable "Show Period Separations".. with some additional indy this should be very useful. Cause many times trend following open price action for the rest of the day

--- 帖子 #228 ---
bad trade... consolidation gives lots of bad signals that is why we want as small as possible stop loss until we catch the big one...

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Interesting indicator. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
consolidation the benefit of placing limit orders in consolidation needs looking into...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
after getting stopped out from the short the ea has taken long position 1st profit is reached and stop for 2nd position is at break even,. Profit for 2nd position is 1000. there are a number of ways the 2nd position can lock on gains. the most profitable relies on exiting after a big run by a candle closing below the low of the channel lo. That is how we try to catch 100's of pips... Whether this is that kind of trade or not will remain to be seen.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
the stop for the 2nd position does not start to trail until the 2nd position goes at least 140 pips so very often the 2nd position falls back to stop out a breakeven we are trying to catch the very big moves so we are willing to get stopped out for small losses and also to let the 2nd position stop out at break even after a small profit has been realized by the first position.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Yes I like the 4hr also. But if you take a hit it is going to be a very big one compared to the gains. I am not comfortable with such a big stop loss. The history is very good so it may be that bad trades are few and far between. Also we found that the 4hour candles form differently according to the different broker time zones. Those setting I posted early on were optimized for FXDD +3 gmt. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Ok thanks, just checking

--- 帖子 #238 ---
so far today stopped out and small gain on position we are trying to catch the big one. ea is set to trade for 3 hours starting at 1 hour before US open. So that's it for today.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
60 candles with 30M chart = 30 hours With your chart, trade went to weekend, so trade was expired. What do you think about weekend?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Oh I see. ea counted actual time not just trading time. Not sure.. in all instances if allowing carrying over weekend is helpful or not. In some of the trades I notice some very good entries are missed because pending closed due to the end of the week. We don't want to bog down the ea, it is running so fast and smooth. But if there were an option to be able to choose carrying pending over weekend or not we would see better how it is. We are missing sometimes very good entries. In one sense I think it would be worth it to try to catch the entry even it meant losing a few weekend trades trying to do it. That is the benefit of a small stop loss. With this strategy if we miss an entry it could be a very long time before the pa crosses the channel again. With the option in the pop up we could turn it off if we see that is it is significantly counter productive. It is difficult to say absolutely one way or the other without running several tests. But to miss a big move is very bad since we are investing in trying to catch it. Don't settle in and get too comfortable I have seen something else we may want to do that would help refine the entries and could make a very significant difference in the results. But not too much at once. Let's get the pending opening and closing finely tuned first. We are making very good progress. If we stopped here we already have a winner. But we want a champion... We thank you so very much...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
continued testing for good trading times has yielded 2 very good times. It is more like avoiding bad times, when the pair is more likely to be in consolidation... or not trending... or even not trading like when trading activity is very light. So for EU on the 15m we found gmt3-9 to be good and gmt 14-17 to be good. We have set up 2 charts EU 15m and set the ea up on each of them with the specific times for that chart. It is important that they each have different magic number so there will be no confusion in trying to manage the trades. When the train leaves the station we want to be on it...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Here's a plain vanilla setting for EU 15 Nothing fancy here. No trailing stops. Stop loss 30 take profits for 1 and 2 set at 25 pips. gmt settings should allow for trading only Tokyo open until 3 hours after US open.. gmt 3 through 17 This is for v10 which is significantly different from the preceding volumes. 12 months back test FXDD micro lots...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I noticed this preset file is stet for gmt 3 I think alpari uk is 2 so im guessing the trading stard and end are off?? never mind I see vs 10 and the euro set file is on 2 so many vs i'm confused.

More consolidation torture looking for the breakout. Decided to just have one chart with trade hour 3 - 17 gmt instead of splitting up trading times 3 - 9 and 14 - 17. Buy stop filled. Because the platform was down I entered the trade manually where it would've been entered by the ea, maybe just a little bit higher.. to try to similuate the ea. But on a day like today this will probably be whipsaw heaven.... Didn't take long stopped out... Again the idea is to accept these small losses with the plan to capture a big move. The ea is tuned to the bigger direction of the market. Trader time for the ea is through for the day and the week. Have a good weekend..

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Best to run some tests with your broker platform. Broker differences are significant. That way you can see potential dd and how the ea might perform with your particular account. I don't have the documentation for that particular test. Just the graph.

i gonna run the EA on my demo account at following pairs : ( 5M ) EURUSD USDJPY AUDUSD EURJPY CHFJPY USDCAD EURCHF let's see for results...

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The tester is useless. For USDJPY the entire months of May and June are missing both in Alpari an FXDD. There are black holes everywhere in every pair. 90% doesn't mean a thing if entire months are missing...... I guess that's part of being on the frontier. What do you think about a simple martingale. Is there such a thing as a simple martingale? Have been manually testing bar by bar on the 15 min EUR By using a slow moving average for the channel, like the 400 ema the crossing up and down is not pronounced as faster moving averages. So far it is producing very good results. Have not had to go more than 1, 2, 3, 4 in a sequence. It might be difficult to afford to be able to go much more than that. The way I was looking at it for now just consider 1 position being opened given an appropriate signal. If it is good and reaches profit limit hooray.. If it falls back and stops out 30 pips sell 2 instead of stopping out. You know how it goes. Because we are using the 400 ema in these settings the crossing back and forth is not so much and a net profit is reached fairly quickly. I know Martingale can get way out of hand very quickly since it is an algebraic progression. But so far it is looking very good. If it is practical we can see how to apply it to the 2 positions we are using. For instance if the trade is good the 2 positions are managed just like they would be for an in profit trade, where they have unique individual profit targets and exit strategies to lock in gain. However if price falls back to the stop level then both positions are treated the same that is they do not have unique management anymore and Martingale kicks in to salvage the trade. The idea is to either breakeven and avoid loss or capture some bit of gain whatever the market will give. The entry being considered a bad entry. I'm sure that would be a coder's worst nightmare to try to configure but it was the most difficult I idea I could come up. I tried to find something worse but no luck. My math might not be right on this. I need to rework it. It may just be getting way too complicated to be practical. What are the thoughts on the possibility of something this?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
??? you mean tp=25 and sl=30 and holding all positions? In this case, buy1 and buy3 is (-25-30)x(1+3) = -55x4 = -220pips sell2 and sell4 is 25x(2+4)=25x6 = +150pips total -70pips without spread. IMHO, with your strategy the position size must be 1,2,3,6,12.... Then from 2nd position, TP price must be changed to TPprice = 2xopen - SLprice + 2xtarget profit/BuyLots because: Gain=(TPprice-open)xBuyLots, Loss=(TPprice-SLprice)XSellLots, SellLots = BuyLots / 2, target profit = Gain-Loss, so target profit = (TPPrice-open)xBuyLots-(TPprice-SLprice)xBuyLots/2, thus TPprice = 2xopen - SLprice + 2xtarget profit/BuyLots To be honest, I am interested in martingale system I made hedge martingale EA before. It was awesome, it earned about 100 pips everyday. I thought I became rich quickly..... But after 2 weeks passed, I lost all profits with my live account.... In those 2 weeks I had a good dream...... If we can find the strategy which has limited consecutive losses, martingale system would be great. I want to try with microlot, but with Alpari UK max order is 2lots with micro account, so consecutive losses must be within 8.... (128x0.01buy + 64x0.01sell = 1.92lots)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yes. I see martingale not as a way to make a profit, but rather as a possible hedge tactic used in conjunction with a trading system that is already profitable. Entries are not random they are calculated to produce a winning trade it would only be if something should go wrong, a bad signal like we see in consolidation areas, surprise news, etc would martingale be of significance. &gt;&gt;&gt;But after 2 weeks passed, I lost all profits with my live account.... In those 2 weeks I had a good dream......&lt;&lt;&lt; Too many consecutive losses? Maximum consecutive wins (profit in money)3 (73.49) consecutive losses (loss in money) 7 (-18.70) Maximal consecutive profit (count of wins)73.49 (3) consecutive loss (count of losses)-18.70 (7) Average consecutive wins1 consecutive losses2 I am not sure how to read the report correctly.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
8 consecutive losses....It was not random entry, but used short period support and resistance....

--- 帖子 #257 ---
How is max consecutive losses? With my EA, it did more than 200 success trades, but finally failed.... It is important to find max consecutive losses carefully...

--- 帖子 #258 ---
yes I see.... If we can work to secure that area.... then the profit will take care of if itself.. There would need to be some fail safe. There cannot be any guarantee that a string of losses will not occur even if ea tests very good 12 months. Perhaps willing to accept 2 x the original stop loss. For example: While trying to avoid a 30 pip loss we would accept a 60 pip net loss if martingale could not turn it around after 3 reverses. 60 pips net loss close all trades. Or something like that, and simply accept a loss. So if martingale was successful 4 out of 5 times which is not unreasonable, it might be worth it. I think it is a mistake to try to build a system that has absolutely no losses. Trick is to minimize. If the system tests very good, that is we can get no more than say 3 max consecutive losses for at least 12 months then the chance of needing the fail safe is very slim, it would be needed very rarely. But it would be in place just in case. Whether or not something like this would do the trick or not remains to be seen. I can try to research this more. No more FXDD. Am switching to Alpari for all testing so that we will be on the same page....

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Jiva, Sorry tell you this but system was working so well in 4 H !

--- 帖子 #260 ---
That is good if you have some nice success. We are looking to trade another way. That is all.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
In the process of switching over to Alpari,UK from FXDD. The thousands of test results that were run on FXDD are all different on Alpari. So it is taking some time to re-orientate. In order to limit losses during consolidation we are considering a martingale strategy, so now it becomes a factor to find best times with settings that produce no more than 3 consecutive losses max.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Alpari Uk seems a better way to go. Keep in mind that this last half of Aug has been a nightmare for most ea's. The trading range has been a bich. eur/use -aug 15 to like the 23 it was droping 300 pips then from 23 to now it shot back up 150 but look at your lower frames like M1 and you'll see its been bouncing like a pinball 40 pips up and down. Nothing pretty

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Good observation. Almost any ea will do very well if the market is trending. The trick is how to deal with the rangebound consolidation areas. We are working on that. How to recognize when a pair is entering consolidation. If we know we can use pending limit orders instead of pending stops. We know how to catch the breakout, now we need to see how to prepare for the consolidation... :nerd:

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Perhaps something like this would work with a martingale. minimal consecutive losses. The stop loss for this is 60. 1st take profit is 15 2nd take profit is 30. How would something like that work with martingale? Open 3:1 per position on reverse tp 20? Close all? If that reversed again number of positions would escalate pretty quickly....

--- 帖子 #267 ---
In working with the channel I'm noticing something that occurs regularly, which is of course what we hope to find, things that occur regularly. We have been up to this time placing pending stops when there is a breach of the channel. In the charts I am looking at the 2ema channel. The sell stop would be placed where the yellow lines are on the chart and we would hope to catch a further move down on a short term breakout. But as we see as soon as there is a break below the channel there is a replacement which is generally good for at least 10 pips on the 15 minute chart. Either of 2 ways to take advantage. Instead of placing sell stops place a sell limit 10 pips away. Or simply enter long tgt 10 pips. Or both.

--- 帖子 #268 ---

Dear Taiyakixz, Are these settings something we can use for martingale? It is using the 2 position ea, but setting like it is one position. No trailing stops. 30 pips stops loss both. profit tgt 25 both. when max consecutive loss reports as 4 it means for both positions stopping out so it is double, if we consider both as 1 position max consecutive loss is 2. Alpari .01 micro 12 months prior. Also same for 10 yrs max loss is bigger for 10 yrs. 2nd set no trailing stop, both stops 30 profit tgt both 20. similarly max consecutive loss reports as 2 means for both positions stopping out so it is double, so report as 2 really means max consecutive loss = 1.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thank you for tuning parameters. I tested with Alpari UK/Live, 2009.09.01-2010.08.26. eumarty2g -&gt; max consecutive losses 4, so 2 trades eumarty1a -&gt; max consecutive losses 2, so 1 trades It seems that it can be used even with no martingale I think that eumarty1a is better... Next, we have to think about multiplier with martingale. To think simply, multiplier = 2.5 because eurmarty1a is s/l=30, t/p=20, multiplier and max level will be set by parameters, the default is multiplier = 2.5, max level = 2. multiplier = 2.5, (unlimited level) 1 loss, 1 win -&gt; -30pips, +50pips = +20pips 2 loss, 1 win -&gt; -30pips, -75pips, +125pips = +20pips 3 loss, 1 win -&gt; -30pips, -75pips, -187.5pips, +312.5pips = +20pips .... when max level = 2, 1 loss, 1 win -&gt; -30pips, +50pips = +20pips 2 loss, 1 win -&gt; -30pips, -75pips, +20pips = -85pips But from backtest we hope that there is no 2 loss..... What do you think...? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It is all new to me. The basic idea I get. But the details of ratios and actual calcs is something I will have to become more familiar with by hands on... To see the dynamics in action. I do have the 1 loss set up and running on my signal accounts. The problem is there can be no guarantee that will be no 2 loss. The thing we need to do is prepare for the worst. And hope for the best. The mistake I see traders make is they prepare for the best and hope the worst will not come. Recipe for failure. If the worst can still somehow be acceptable then that is like cushion under the trade. But the worst must be acceptable. It may be that a bigger picture of loss and gain needs to be seen. In other words if marty works 5 out 6 times, then in considering the 6 trades, the one loss although it might be greater than the original stop for 1 position may still be a lot less than hitting the stop the other 5 times. How difficult will it be for you code? I am very eager to test this. Have been pulling my hair out all day with GU. What else is new? But have learned a few new tricks also. GU is a great teacher. In the sales world, they say, "You learn the most from your toughest customer".

@ Jiva Looking at the nice, smooth back test, I was wondering if there is really any need to set foot on the dangerous and unpredictable Martingale road anyway?

I am not sure I understand martingale properly. Have been doing further research. What I was looking for was a hedging system where instead of stopping out new positions were placed in the new direction. More like a stop and reverse system only not stopping out. From my reading it seems martingale just keeps increasing the number of positions heading in the same direction.. The hedge I was looking at is like this. 1 long tgt 20 stop 30 reaches stop level but does not stop out instead 2 short are placed tgt 20 stop 30 when net profit tgt is reached say +2 pips all 3 closed. (For the same trade this could stop and reverse again, If the 2 short reach their 30 stop level but they do not stop out instead 4 long are opened all 7 are closed +2 pips. Simply a way to salvage a bad entry.) I may not have the calculations worked out properly. But the idea is to get out of the trade without a loss and look for a fresh entry. So as soon as net gain is +2 close all. But no more than 3 reverses may need to go to 5 reverses. If it doesn't work then just take the loss. If the strategy is good with no more than 2 consec losses then this should work 100% of the time, if it misses once or twice in 12 months the loss can be absorbed and would be less than if the 30 pip stop losses had been hit for the total of bad trades during that time. This would need some actual mathematical calculations to see if it is workable. But that's the idea but that is not actually martingale... It is a hedge strategy. Does this make sense to you?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi guys, first of all, want to thank you for your hard and excellent work you spend on this (jiva34, Taiyakixz ... guys, you rock http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif ). This is gr8 idea jiva34, finally I got you. If this would be possible to code, this gonna be perfect 100% system especially w/ stress on safety. It's like every time you hit position stoploss, you don't close it, but open oposite positions ... every time youdouble it. Here come's the question, how far you want to go w/ these consecutive hedge positioning. However, this idea is worth to get a chance.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
The devil is in the details... As they say. That's where Taiyakixz comes in. http://aloiroberto.files.wordpress.c...inux-devil.jpg The system should be first class to begin with... The hedge strategy wouldn't eliminate risk but it might help to reduce it, but then again it might introduce a whole new generation of risk parameters. So we are exploring the benefits and drawbacks of something like this. For a system that shows 1 consecutive loss consistently it might look like this... see the chart. (This is just for illustration and doesn't correspond with the comments) Another area we will explore eventually is the use of pending limit orders as well as pending stops and how to identify consolidation areas. Lots to do to get this right....

--- 帖子 #277 ---
yes, this basic strategy is almost the same as my hedge martingale EA which I made before. My EA really earned about 100pips everyday, but it was too risky.... If we can use this idea with a few cosecutive losses, it will be awesome. I will recalculate s/l, t/p and size of position. Now our problem is how we can avoid consecutive losses. If s/l=30 and price makes range around 30pips, price touches s/l many times. One idea of sizing position is what I post at #254. position size is 1,2,3,6,12.... Then from 2nd position, TP price must be changed to (when buy)TPprice = 2xopen - SLprice + 2xtarget profit/BuyLots because: Gain=(TPprice-open)xBuyLots, Loss=(TPprice-SLprice)XSellLots, SellLots = BuyLots / 2, target profit = Gain-Loss, so target profit = (TPPrice-open)xBuyLots-(TPprice-SLprice)xBuyLots/2, thus TPprice = 2xopen - SLprice + 2xtarget profit/BuyLots (if you want to earn 2pips everytime and s/l=30, Gain=2 and SLprice=open-30)

--- 帖子 #278 ---
yes, the idea is to get out of the trade since it was a bad entry. so to exit with 2 pips is acceptable. Then ea is free to look for a good entry. So when you say consecutive losses you mean once the hedge has been initiated. In back test so far we have been able to identify settings that produce 1 or 2 max consecutive loss for the basic entries. But that is not a measure of how many consecutive losses there may be once the hedge has been initiated. How much net loss would we be looking at if it should go wrong? Say the max number of reverses allowed is 4 and +2 net profit is not reached.... for 20 tgt, 30 stop?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
???? I think that I don't understand what you say correctly... if you want to use always tp=20 and sl=30 and earn more than 2pips, 1st trade: 1 buy tp=20, sl=30, if win +20pips 2nd trade: 3 sell tp=20, sl=30, if win 20x3-(20+30) = +10pips 3rd trade: 7 buy(total 8 buy) tp=20, sl=30, if win 20x8-(20+30)x3 = +10pips 4th trade: 18 sell(total 21 sell) tp=20, sl=30, if win 20x21-(20+30)x8 = +20pips if trade stops with 4 losses, loss is 30x21 = -630pips if you want to get always 2pips with s/l=30 and move tp, 1st trade: 1 buy tp=2, sl=30, +2pips 2nd trade: 2 sell tp=32, sl=30, 32x2-(32+30) = +2pips 3rd trade: 3 buy(total 4 buy) tp=31, sl=30, 31x4-(31+30)x2 = +2pips 4th trade: 6 sell(total 8 sell) tp=30.5, sl=30, 30.5x8-(30.5+30)x4 = +2pips if trade stops with 4 losses, loss is 30.5x8 - 0x4 = -244pips

Am looking at something little different. Maybe my calcs are not right, also how would spread fit into the equation? But since the idea is to simply get out of a bad trade with 0 or minimal loss I was looking at a very small stop loss since it would be more likely to get hit quickly and end the hedge. But for this it would require a bigger multiplier to recoup any losses. There are also hidden risks, like broker disconnect at an awkward moment.... Not to be taken lightly or discounted if the stakes are high. The charts show what I have been researching. Please let me know what you think. Is this reasonable? I think it is. Would need sufficent balance to see it to the close of all. But it could mean never taking a stop again and on a successful setting it might not even get initiated all that often. Again we are not looking for profit with this, we just want to get out of a bad entry with 0 loss. I have studied dozens of trades like this on the 5m that were taken on the AU 1h. So far none have gone further than close all at f). Original setting for trade was tp 20 stop 30 Setting for hedge is close all net 0, open buy (or sell) x multiplier after move 10 pips wrong direction. On the charts "10 pip stops" refers to the number pips move for price action in the wrong direction before a new order x multiplier is placed in the hedge.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
ummmm....I think that I understand what you say. From 2nd order, 10pips stop, and if 10pips move to the last order's direction, all orders are closed. In this case, to make a trade break even, position size is 1, 4, 9, 18, 37, 74..... example, 1st order buy, trade continues to 6th order 1st order : buy(1) = -40 2nd order : sell(4) = +10x4 = +40 3rd order : buy(9) = -20x9 = -180 4th order : sell(18) = +10x18 = +180 5th order : buy(37) = -20x37 = -740 6th order : sell(74) = +10x74 = +740 total -40+40-180+180-740+740 = 0 Your posted charts are example or real strategy? I think that 10pips stop often makes consecutive losses....

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yes, 10 pips stop can make consecutive losses, but also increases the probability that break even will be reached quickly. The posted charts show actual losing trades from a fairly profitable 1hr setting for AU. I want to so examine the dynamics of the losing trades which I think were only a few on the EU 15 min settings. By keeping the hedge setting at reverse for 10 pips it is sure to be closed quickly. At some point within a fairly short period of time no matter which way the price action is heading it is sure to reach the 10 pips to close all for break even. No loss ea. But for original settings stop loss more than 30 I think the multiplier might be too large. If this works for salvaging bad trades we may see some way to set for profit also. But for now if we can get "NO LOSS EA". I am very very happy.. http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...9w7zA831QBl8U=

I analyzed each of the losing trades for eumarty1a. The results are shown in the charts. How difficult will it be to code this? If this works like it appears to in the manual tests and analysis this could make the ea "loss proof". My kind of ea!!!! These are the actual losing trades for 12 months prior. Alpari. 15 min EURUSD There were 10 bad entries for the 12 months I posted 7, that's max ff allows to attach to a thread. But you can see the idea. The remaining 3 were just like these. Only 1 went to 6th order. Most were 2,3,and 4th order. For a micro account trading .01 what would the balance have to be to withstand a hedge to the 6th order?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
$464.94 10pips x 96(total opposite orders) = 960 960 with 0.01lot = $96 Margin 2.58(0.01lots,leverage1:500,currently,can be changed) x 143(total orders) = $368.94 96 + 368.94 = $464.94

--- 帖子 #286 ---
What do you say? Let's code it!!! I will keep researching the bad trades on our best settings.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I answered your question

--- 帖子 #288 ---
?????? What you mean by answer is, it is not practical. 6 orders is too much consecutive? I have studied trades all the way to 8/8/08 and none have gone more than 6 orders. Most are 1 order, 2 order and 3 order. It seems like for a "sure thing" to extend that much risk is no risk. But you have practical experience. I am only researching...

--- 帖子 #289 ---
It is very tempting. For this setting EURUSD 15m, 12 months prior, Alpari After analyzing all of the losing trades and applying the hedging strategy, there were no hedged positions over 3 orders. The chart shows the worst one. That would have given no losing trades for the 12 month period. I am going to run the test for a 10 year period and start to look at each of the losing trade to see what is the worst. If nothing is worse than 6 levels this is do-able in my opinion. It just seems that to extend that much risk capital for a sure thing is no risk at all. But maybe, you are telling me it "hair-brained" like the fascination I had with trading inverse? I should listen to your advice, if that is what you are saying.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Jiva, Strategy 4h is the best with profitability and with no dificult things like hedge or dangerous martingale. So, in order to improve that profitable strategy 4H have you already consider mantain a thread for 4H and another one to 15 mn ? I'm in live with 4h, with presets you posted, and until now i have only profitable trades with no stress. Regards.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
At any time are you prepared to accept the 140 x 2 stop loss? I was set up with the 4h on several pairs. I took the loss. It made me consider was it worth it? I decided no. If you want to set up a thread for the 4h trading you can. I have no objection. Actually it is helpful to post, maybe you could post on the journals forum and that would help you keep track and stay focused on your development as a trader. If you do please give us your link so we can follow you. We are exploring the possibilities from many angles. To reiterate: There are 2 main reasons we have for abandoning the 4h settings. 1. The stop loss is too large. 2. The 4 h candles form differently for different broker's gmt.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I will continue to see if there is a way to use this. If not we can abandon the idea.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Taiyakixz, sir; (The chart below is not necessarily to scale). 2 Questions: 1. Would this be too many order levels? 2. Is there a way to trail the % net gain like we do with a trailing stop? Thank you in advance for answering my dumb questions.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Is this a practical situation?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I think that 6 orders with backtest is too much because we should think more some losses than backtest. 6 orders is 143 lots....it must be max orders.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
In this case 6 order levels is total 63 lots, I think it is acceptable. If you want to trailing stop, it should start when break even + trailng pips. But I think that I don't understand this strategy correctly. Why is 2nd sell price different from 1st at your next post...?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I am very eager to test this not just in the tester but in demo. The difference in 2nd order is because in first case increments of 10 pips were still being used. In second case I was experimenting with increments of 40 pips. Yes trailing stop, break even + pips. So the losing trade may become a winning trade. To use this the account balance would have to large enough to accommodate the inevitable drawdown. A micro with $1500 trading .01 for first order seems bizarre by some standards. Risking almost $500 to make $2? But there is no risk. The hedge will close at break even or better eventually. 1 trade/2days (possible for 15 min time frame) x $2 x 200 trading days for 12 months = $200 return on $1500 capital. 14% return. Taking into consideration compounding and gain for trailing past break even... more like 30% or more. No risk. Need sufficient balance to accommodate drawdown. Although there are more lots when using 10 pip increments between orders, the amount price action moves is very limited and break even is likely to occur very quickly as opposed to larger increments and smaller total lots which could take quite some time and price action will have to move considerably more. So although there would be less lots with larger increments the drawdown would still be considerable. Thank you for being willing to consider this. It will be a lot of work work no doubt. But it is so tempting. I will continue to study the individual trades to find worst case scenarios and also the pros and cons of increments and lot sizes.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
ummmm.... You mean 1st s/l is 30pips, from 2nd s/l is 40pips? 3rd order is 40pips? or 50pips? I think that martingale should be selected on/off. Your example, trade starts 0.01lot with account $1500. But if you don't use martingale, you can increase lot size. Stoploss is 30pips. If you take 3% risk, you can trade 0.15lots. So some may like martingale off.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Sorry, bit confusing. Open 1 tp 20, stop loss 30. If martingale activated, 40 pip increments for succeeding orders. Just an experiment. yes, definitely on/off. Also a way to set the progression? 1,2,4,9,18.... etc could be changed to anything.. 1,2,3,4 whatever... I will need some time to go over individual trades too see more of the dynamics and how long it takes to get out of the hedge, how many orders it can go, at what increments etc. I am looking for the really bad cases but have not found them yet, nothing over 6 orders yet. I will keep looking because anything over 6 is definitely way out to the extreme. In trading we are always looking at probabilities. Does a strategy give an edge to the probability curve in our favor? The extremes are always encountered at some point. The idea is to be far enough ahead so when extremes occur the probability is still in our favor. That we remain ahead of the mean. I don't know if that makes any sense to anyone else it seems to make sense to me. Probably the best way to make money in forex is to open a brokerage.

It may be that setting trader hour to the most active times will help to avoid the consolidations that cause the use of consecutive orders. London open.

I guess if I want a bumpy ride I should test for GU. Maybe we will find some nightmares there...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I talked with jiva about hedge martingale system. It's very difficult to add the system to the ea, because taking order is very complex. It has pending order, expire, selecting 2nd order, trailing stop, flexible sizing....and so on. It will take very long time to make it. So at the moment we think about basic strategy. I don't give up making hedge martingale system, but it's better to think about good entries without waiting it.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Nice trading system+strategy; thanks to Jiva34 and Taiyakixz. Attached results from 08/18. By the way, the negative trade comes from another EA (MD). For accurate analysis consider the trades with 0.1 and 0.2 lots. Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Great system. 100 GBP 0.10 lot on a 5M EUR/USD chart. SL 25 pips.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
A little tweak with the TP setting and bingo much better. Is there anyway to get the EA to not trade if the price is above the 80 or below the 20 of the DSS or if the price is say above 80 it will only take a short when we start to have red dots?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Nice.. could you zip the set file you used and post it? What broker? what time frame? what volume? I would like to test drive. thanks. I haven't looked very closely at the significance of 20/80 for dss, just direction. Taiyakixz is pretty knowledgeable for coding, if 20/80 could help filter bad trades he could code it. I'll take a look at that. Have you noticed relevance for that? stop loss 25 is nice isn't it....

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yeah let me find a free zip program. I am using Alpari UK, The time frame is 5M but i am using 3 other MA's on different time frames to find the trend. When you say volume i am guessing you mean the modelling quality which is 90%. The setting i use with the DSS are 33,25 i have seen it happen a lot using this EA. if the EA only took sell signals at 80 with red dots and at 20 buy signals with green dots that would filter out some trades and also might make the EA take some trades? Really nice EA

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thank you for backtest. I modified the EA. It buys only when DSS&lt;=20 and sells only when DSS&gt;=80. Please check it. v11.0 is added Use_DSS(selection of using DSS). Then I added Use_DSS_Limit to v11.0_DSSlimit. At the moment it is not official release . If it is good, it will be v12.0.

--- 帖子 #312 ---

Sorry for bothering sforma, I didn't get you. You didn't zipped it (maybe you forget attach zip file). Maybe more helpfull would be screenshot from your Alpari, there I can exactly see the details settings for EA and DSS indicator used (as example see mine). Thanks. (are you using the same settings for all your currency pairs, or are they different ?)

--- 帖子 #317 ---
subscribed! --&gt; just attached indis and EA to tpl charts and a buy stop order was triggered on eurjpy...i checked the trade and saw that sl is 140 pips and tp 10?! does this work? : p

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Do not use this EA with the default setting. It must be changed. You can find the setting file at 1st post or there are many posts about settings. Some of them are s/l=140, but you can find smaller s/l settings. Please pick up the setting which you like.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Dear Taiyakixz, In researching further I am finding something. Please do not jump out a window when I discuss what I am looking at. We want to make money so we are looking at whatever we find that might give us the winning edge. I do not know if it is possible to incorporate both ideas into the one adviser. But there are 2 distinct strategies which share many of the same features. 1. The stop entry strategy for catching trends and 2. The limit entry strategy for dealing with consolidations. The stop entry strategy is more less pretty well developed already up to and including v10and v11. Here is the idea behind the limit strategy: Identify trend on higher time frame with moving average Trade on lower time frame using 2 moving averages and price action. The channel would be used only to act as trailing stop but not for entries. If somehow, both strategies could be incorporated into the one ea it could be a powerhouse. No doubt such an endeavor would be like trying to climb Mt. Everest for Tayiakixz. If it is possible that one set of conditions is there then the limit entry strategy is activated and when the other set of conditions is present the stop entry strategy is activated. If this can be done in one adviser? Perhaps if the 1st thing the adviser looks for is either 1 of 2 things, did a candle close below or above the channel, if not then did a candle close above or below the 21sma. And go from there for conditions? http://www.everestnews.com/everestup...-With%20O2.jpg If not we might just want to leave the original as it is. And code a separate entity. The more I analyze these trades the more I think this sell limit strategy may be just fine as a stand alone ea. However if they could be in one ea, all the bases would be covered, trending markets and flat markets. Let me elaborate further with charts. The first chart is the day chart with vertical line markers to mark downtrends and up trends 200sma The other charts show typical trades using limit entries in the direction of the main trend on the day chart. It is possible that this could work fairly well on a lower time frame combination. Say finding the trend on the 30 minute and trading the 15m. By only trading during certain market hours it is possible to filter out a lot of bad entries.

go back a few days and there is a consolidation with the day trend down

--- 帖子 #323 ---
If we actually want to do this it will take a lot of work to put both strategies into one expert. Perhaps we could make a separate expert for the limit strategy and try to work out the bugs. then consider the possibilities of putting the 2 together at some point. A one cancels other kind of ea. I think it can be done. But maybe not until the limit strategy is running nicely by itself and we are comfortable with what it can and cannot do. Where the bad trades are, etc. I like it. I think we have something here.

Okay your original screenshot #320 was for September. The sma200 and sma 21 were indeed up and so no limit sells. these last screen shots are from June #326. Let me see what is going on.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
There is something else to consider also. If both stop and limit strategies were in the same ea, there will be another factor at play. Which strategy is activated, in other words which signal is generated first... If bad trades for one strategy are indeed overridden by the signal for a good trade. It may be that signals for both strategies are generated at the same time, in that case no trade... One of the signals may be good but which one? No trade would be the safe way to go.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
the first sell limit would not have been filled the second was a bad trade 21 ema rather than 21 sma would have avoided the bad trade.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
looks like 21 ema may be better than 21sma. Again the bad the bad trades would have been avoided.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
yes...

Hi jiva34, any news on this topic (hope, you don't abandon your Dragon ) ?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
There are some serious issues about to hit the proverbial fan. US lawmakers have just passed bill in Congress that now makes it illegal for US residents to hold forex accounts with brokers outside the US. Unbelievable but true!! In a "free" country. US brokers cannot issue more than 50:1 leverage and must adhere to FIFO and not allow hedging. I shall have to see how to adjust to these new roadblocks. And what that will mean for using an ea. these changes will start going into effect over the next month or so. It may be other countries will follow this standard after some time. We have not abandoned the dragon. On the contrary I am digging deeper into applications and am having some amazingly good results. Not ready to post yet. Still experimental.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
As if often the case, by giving things a bit of a rest, and experimenting with this and that, whatever, a new angle of vision has emerged for jivadragon. I have been manually trading with good measure of success by always trading in the direction of trend. As tempting as counter trend can be, I have avoided trading pullbacks, they are very unpredictable and can be quite shallow with huge risk. By making sure the trend on the higher time frame is in tact, even an entry is not quite right eventually the trend resumes. Very elementary, however in spur of the moment it is very easy to jump in to try to catch quick gains, only to find oneself trapped in a runaway trade in the wrong direction. Out of curiosity I set the expert on all time frames for the 10sma. Taiyakixz in his infinite wisdom has added an incredible multi-time frame option for up to 5 time frames with options for type of ma. (even a shift function which we have yet to even begin to experiment with) Incredible. I was completely taken aback when he surprised us with this. It has taken some time to begin to appreciate the great value. The results of back testing EU with 10sma on all 5 time frames is great.

As a US citizen my choices of broker are getting more and more limited. the test and settings are done with FXDD, malta. tweaking may be necessary for traders using other brokers. I ran a test using the settings for eu from fxdd, and there were losses. I changed the channel value a few points and it is fine. These are the settings for eu for Alpari, uk.

seems like EA is ready for live now? didn't follow the thread for a long time now.... : / short update please : ]

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Yes, it looks like were are ready. I'm sorry I am kind of strapped for time. the thread is not very long. If you take a minute or two to read through you'll catch the gist of things. That's the great part about these threads. They are very good records of what has been happening. I always keep the 1st page updated with the latest downloads etc.. Bast Wünsche jiva...

--- 帖子 #345 ---
ok , gonna try EA next week while sitting in the university : D u r doing well with it live so far? best regards and a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
the stop loss is large on these settings. In the past I have hesitated to use a large stop loss. But with these settings the trend is so well defined and the trades are only with the trend much of the risk is filtered out. Also these settings are for the 1 hour. So larger stops are not unreasonable. I just feel more confident using, 140 and even 200 pip stops because the trend is so well defined. That isn't to say there may not be a disaster at some point... Maybe Taiykizx's Martingale hedge technique would be in order here. No stone unturned. http://papelipe.no/var/weblog/storag...llerylarge.jpg

--- 帖子 #347 ---
jiva, thank you for many backtests. I tested #342 setting, v11.0, Alpari UK/Live. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With #336 and #337, 2 losses(1 trade because ea takes 2 positions) with Alpari. At the moment I cannot test gbpusd and eurgbp with high modelling quality....

--- 帖子 #348 ---
ummmm....... with jiva's mtf settings, H4 MA and D1 MA are used.... Those candles are much different if broker's timezone is different. It causes different results by brokers....? jiva, what do you think....?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Yes I considered that. For my own trading since US citizen my choices of brokers are getting narrower and narrower every day I just went ahead with 4h and day anyway for FXDD. But it may not be all that significant, only in very rare cases. The ma is slower to change in the higher time frames. Gu uses 34 sma. the channel for all the settings is slow too, 55 ema. So maybe little tweak for different brokers. EU and EURGBP both use 10 sma but on the higher time frames it doesn't change that quickly. It may be the worst that will happen is some good trades are missed, since entry requires all time frames agree. I think if there are losses they may come from different price feeds and the affect they have on the candles closing outside the channel on the 1hr. The candles on the 1hr form pretty much the same across brokers. So it is different price feeds not ma differences for trend indication on 4hr and day. As little as 1 pip difference can cause the candle to close outside the channel. Alpari channel for eu needed to be set at 65 rather 55. Even Geoff's ea has little bit of differences for different brokers, works best for the broker he uses, Alpari. It's going to be like that, not just the candle forming differently because of time frame but actually different price quotes since market is not standardized. For my own trading I have to stay with FXDD. They have made some "backroom" adjustments that completely circumvent US regulators new rules. So FIFO, no hedging, etc has no affect on usual way of trading. Can do just like before. No problem. Using your mtf options has made the difference for the ea. I didn't see it at the time when you surprised us with mtf, but it was sheer genius to add these. We can't thank you enough for your hard work. I look at all the work you have put into this ea and I am amazed. Ever grateful. Nothing short of miraculous. I think a little tweaking here and there for broker differences in price quotes will get us by. I am extremely confident of this ea with the present strategy in place. Trend is everything and we've nailed it. Maybe we want to see about Martingale hedge for emergency cases. It may work because the problem with Martingale is getting caught in a consolidation. But the bad entries with the present strategy using mtf, would come from the familiar buying a top and selling a bottom, which is usually a pretty quick and drastic turn around. So quick that the 1st target of 20 pips isn't even reached. Follow my reasoning? The bad entries I have seen are the top and bottom variety. Trend is so well defined in the strategy that consolidations are avoided. But it will take some more hands on to confirm that is the case. Because all it takes is one Martingale caught in a consolidation to "end the party". Another reason I like using FXDD is because the spreads are fixed ( I don't mind paying a little more for a fixed spread) I can test, test, test, on the weekend. Missed you.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I have a special need for the 20 sec delay, which you kindly added, but for most traders they will not need it. So just set it to 0. Notice, no pending orders!! mtf is that good... That is another reason I feel so confident about this strategy. The mtf defines trend so well there is no need even for pending orders!!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Better setting for EURGBP than previously posted. Instead of 1st profit 20, 2nd profit 1000 trying to catch the big ones, better overall results, is 1st profit 20, 2nd profit 50. 1hour

jiva please excuse another question .... how many trades there are at each pair a week? and how many trades there air at once max.? (margincalculation^^) thank you so much for your work....ea does look pretty cool now best regards and thanks in advance PhanTi'

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Looks like for EURUSD average about 3 or 4 month. So maybe 1/week. Only 1 trade (2 positions) opened at a time. Am going to spend time today studying the actual trades on the charts. since there are no losses I want to see how close the trade comes to being a loss and under what conditions it could happen. Because the stop is pretty big and a loss would be significant. But we don't have any losses to study

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Оther result with presets on EURUSD tf=H4 and mistakes of the testing.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Dear Taiyakixz, In studying the trades on the charts it seems that if we could find entries when all the available times frames agree we can get even better entries further minimizing drawdown and avoiding bad entries. Perhaps trading on a lower time frame. So, question for you is: After this nice little vacation from coding would you consider adding 2 more ma options to the 5 we already have, so that we can set for 5 min &amp; 1 min? Is there any way to set for weekly in the tester? That is the really powerful trend indication.... Obviously, to live test forward for weekly will take a long time...

--- 帖子 #357 ---
so 4 trades a pair means ~ 40 trades a month ( low spread pairs only). so we have to push lotsizes to earn some nice money .... how about trading a lower timeframe with more trades to spread risk over i.e 100 trades than over 10 trades while banking more but smaller wins?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
The ea was set up in the tester but did not take any trades during the range bound market. That is very good. It only trades in well established trends. We like that very much.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes, that is the idea to be set up on several pairs. I understand your point about lower time frames and I have put some time and effort into testing trades on the lower time frames, tweaking settings, etc., but this particular strategy does not produce the same results on other time frames. Somehow the 1 hr is optimal. Reminder: this ea is extremely versatile and this strategy we are optimizing at present is just one of many possible strategies for the ea. But it is by far the best one so far... for sure...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I will modify the EA to check 7 MAs and send it to you. I don't know how to do backtest with weekly chart, but I think it's not so hard to do it manually. Even 10 years not so many trades will be done.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Excellent. Yes I can run the tester without weekly since it cannot process weekly but open the chart and see if there is bad trade, would the weekly setting have prevented it, and would the weekly setting block good trades too? I am not thinking necessarily to trade on the day or weekly charts. (But of course you never really know until you get into it), what I was thinking was to be able to set a moving average on the weekly chart to confirm a trend for trading the 1 hr. To set weekly ma for a live forward demo what is the minutes? day = 1440, so weekly is 1440x5=7200? Is that correct to set ea for moving average on the weekly time frame on live demo?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
There is a note on the first page of the thread in red at the bottom of the page. We have abandoned any 4hr setup for the ea. Please take a look at the note. It explains why. We are focused on the 1h chart. The latest download for eu is available on the first page. I am setting up a special page which will have all available updated settings for different pairs. Will be posted soon. Добро пожаловать. Некоторые из самых блестящих трейдеры из России.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
updated setting as of 10/10/10. (Check 1st page for directions to post with the latest updated settings) These settings were calculated using FXDD,malta and are for the 1hr chart. Jiva Dragon v11 There is one setting for Alpari,UK, for eu.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
weekly is 1440x7 = 10080

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Evidently the moving average can be set for weekly in the tester. Only thing is trades cannot be tested on weekly, but we are not interested in testing the weekly chart, only in setting a moving average to identify long term trend. Using 10080 for the ma time frame does work. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
trade underway demo. 1st tgt reached +20 pips stop has moved to break even. For this setting, 2nd tgt is 1000. 2d position will close with either of 4 conditions, whichever comes first: candle falls back to break even, 0 pips candle reaches tgt 1000 pips candle closes below the channel low + whatever the amt is pips it falls back to trailing stop (set for 200), trailing stop is only activated after 1st position is closed. most likely here, will fall back to 0, but ya never know, maybe we caught a big one, FOMC minutes were favorable for USD weakness.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
not so pretty trade gu. The ea did something a bit strange. It opened 2 positions and then closed 1 right away for 0 pips. I use a delay order function for a special application and it was set to 20 secs. But why this should happen is a mystery. Anyway, the 2nd position is dangerously close to the stop, with FOMC minutes to be broadcast in 10 mins. Turn around? or disaster?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Are you using a particular template for the 1hr?

--- 帖子 #370 ---
template and updates are on the 1st page. the moving averages and sometimes the channel settings vary for pair and have to be reset to match the ea settings to follow on the chart.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
let's see where the EURGBP trade goes... If the 55 sma channel low can pass the fixed stop at break even we can try to ride a big one. SCRATCH THAT..oops, I had the wrong settings. should have been a simple, 20, 50 trade..

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hanging in the balance.. with GU http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...RLIFDhu4m6Yo8=

--- 帖子 #373 ---
you mean besides using the correct set file per pair?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
If the zipped set file is loaded the ea will trade accordingly. But to visually follow the action on the chart the ma or the channel might need to be adjusted to match the set file, because they can vary a bit from pair to pair. For example the ma's for eu are 10 across all time frames but for gu the ma's are 34 across all time frames. :nerd:

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I gotcha! I've been using your set files so all is well. My charts are all using the same template so they are not adjusted. Thanks for explaining.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
We are honored that a veteran such as yourself has taken an interest in our humble efforts.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
haha! Thanks for the compliment but I am just your average joe. I think the basis of this ea is sound and I like the way it operates. I have tried a few other ea's for fun and some of them were rather scary. I am fairly conservative and this seems to fit my personality. I originally was interested in neural nets when I began trading. The big players use quant and supercomputers to trade. I think the future is along the realm of ea's.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Yes I believe the basic strategy is sound. Now how to realize the potential. From the link in your post, I see you have no doubts about the great value of trading with clear knowledge of the predominant and subordinate trends. It is like catching wind in the sails and is vital for sustained success. Sometimes a lesson very hard learned, but so simple and necessary. This is what we are trying to do with the use of moving averages over multi time frames. Using the same ma for different time frames rather different values on the same time frame seems to give the best results so far. It appears to be of value in avoiding consolidations also. So the ea will wait for a strong trend indication before entering a trade. There are still difficulties with unpredictable spikes on surprise news, and the possibility of buying a top and selling a bottom, which we all love to do... So that is still the challenge, how to avoid the top and bottom syndrome or in other words how trade "topless and bottomless". Taiyakixs is the genius who coded everything. Nice and neat. He is meticulous to the point of exasperation. Excellent qualities for mt4. He is adding more options for setting moving averages. So 3 more time frames will be available. And the possibility of setting more than one ma on a single time frame. So more fiddling around. We want to see if this helps. Trend is everything... Not familiar with quants and neural nets (feedback loops?) but now you've got me to add a research project to my list.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
update on scary close call GU trade. Of course it's not over until the position is closed but so far disaster has been averted. If this was a loser than that would have been the first loser in over a year for the ea..

--- 帖子 #380 ---
nothing to write home about.. the ea finally closed the scary gu trade +20 pips after challenging the 200 pips stop loss. But still no losses for 16 months. The trade was strange from the very beginning. The 2nd position closed at breakeven right away. There are number of different ways second position can close but only after the first position is closed. For a loss: If it is stopped out along with the first position If 1st position reaches target: For 0 gain: By falling back to break even For +gain: If reaches the target or hit trailing stop if one is set or closes outside channel low for long, outside channel hi or short. None of those conditions were present. And in no case should the 2nd position close before the 1st??? Will check with Taiyakixz, maybe a bug... http://pixarplanet.com/blog/images/440.jpg

working on settings audcad has a radically different setting from the others. back test to 3 years, all the data I have, only 2 bad trades... I could live with that.... sold a bottom and bought a top. No consolidation nightmares.. We may be able to filter out the top and bottom thing...

--- 帖子 #386 ---
there are subtle differences in price quotes among the brokers. I run into it all the time with all the ea's.. If I know trades are being opened with other brokers, sometimes I just open the trades manually. By the way, Alpari tested very differently from FXDD. If you are up for it you might want to optimize the settings for Alpari. I seriously doubt you can get the same results for Alpari that will be there for FXDD. It's just the way it is in "Wild Wild Forex". The strategy is good, but the settings may need to be customized for broker's quotes. For example FXDD has fixed spreads , Alpari has very good cheap spreads but they vary, this in itself can cause big differences in how the ea tests. 1 pip difference can mean entry or no entry.. etc.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Looking good, go little doggie, go...

okay!! 1st tgt reached and stop is moved to break even. Not trailing, either +50 or 0 for 2nd position.. update: fell back to break even for 0 pips 2nd position...

--- 帖子 #389 ---
meanwhile, ea has opened long audcad, the newest addition to the portfolio. I made a slight change by adding t3ma 55 after the positions opened, but it should be okay without it for this trade.. actually I closed both positions manually because the trade didn't have the confirmation from t3ma. Which I added afterwards...

I don't know ur prehistory in trading and i don't know whether u earn ur daily cash with trading and i don't know whether ur want to use this ea to make some really nice cash or not... so,actually not : D just let me know

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I'll be honest with you. I make a little and then I lose a little. Mostly I am profitable. But I have some serious losses along the way, mostly because I trade when I am not focused. When I am focused I win win win. Then I get hazy in my perceptions and enter a trade without real sharp focus, and bam, it's a loss and I have to give back some. That is why the ea is so attractive to me. The ea is always focused. It is up to us to fine tune. But ea will not get spaced out and trade half asleep. If ea makes a loss we can see how to fine tune further. But it is not inattentiveness. My biggest problem. Inattentiveness. Also I do not want to be glued to the monitor, "Where is a trade, where is a trade" for hours on end. The ea can do that, no problem, ea has nothing else to do. I can simply check the screen from time to time to make sure everything is running smoothly, that is all. So now we work very hard to get the ea to trade reliably. Then ea works hard trading. Serious cash, you bet... With as little risk as possible...

Isn't Malta's time the same as fxdd NY ?? Some of my set files say 3 and some say 2. lol

--- 帖子 #401 ---
??? which ones ??? I'm not aware. actually the offset will need to be set according to whatever broker is being used. yes as far as I know FXDD Malta and FXDD US have same offset which is +3 right now, I think it changes which daylight savings. I probably need to make of note of that on the 1st page, for newbies. Thanks..

--- 帖子 #402 ---
It's crazy but I do this to myself every year around this time. Daylight savings etc. I went back and read the thread again and it doesn't really make any difference as we are trading 24hrs. Fxdd daily close is at 5pm est. That was the thing that I always paid attention to as a daily candle trader. My Malta account is being "repatriated" so I am setting up on fxdd US this weekend. My demo testing this week on fxdd malta netted roughly 250 pips with no losses. Mainly eu/us, eu/chf, eu/gbp. Gotta get some sleep. Let the ea keep an eye on things.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Yes, My account is being "repatriated also" but you may be happy to hear, it won't make a bit if difference! The folks at FXDD have figured out a way to circumvent the whole thing.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=9211 http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...7PwyVbJSF3DKE=

trading 24 hours... not unless setting is 0 to 24. For gmt+3 settings are 0 to 16. I think one pair pair is set differently. But mostly 0 to 16. Noneof them are set 24 hours. There were some losses for 24 hours. But set for Tokyo open to NY noon the results were much better. Mkt tends to have active trending during that time. Pleasant dreams.

good morning guys just set up EA... are there more sets than those : ?? got 10 pips spread on eurcad and audcad : x looking forward to first ea results

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Morning... What broker are you using? may need to change the gmt, These settings are from FXDD, they will test slightly different for other brokers, no doubt. May need to tweak... spread is little more than the majors, FXDD fixed 8 and 9. Still worth it. Worked on EURCAD and AUDCAD all night!! Finally got some settings that work for the last 12 months, but further back than that is not pretty. So little hesitant. The other settings seemed reasonable going back 3 or more years, not great , but reasonable. But these 2 were disastrous, only good for the last 12 months or so... Little scary... Must be the CAD influence.. Have yet to find anything for USDCAD Posting them anyway... Friday can be rough... Good luck..

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Just an aside. If you can trade USDTRY you might want to look at it. It is a screaming short all the way to the monthly 200ema. Has retraced some. rollover short is $3.60 mini. Might want to get in short and just sleep on it for a couple of weeks or more. Margin is expensive though. Have been in and out shorting for weeks now. Very nice. I think I will just leave the one short in there now open for a while. rollover is like getting a dividend.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'm using FXOpen, presets from p1 p1 are not recommended so far? only use those ?? best regards Phanti

--- 帖子 #410 ---
All the presets referred to (the 3 links so far total 7) are up to date. euh1mtf10d.zip is a kind of short hand for EURUSD... Just thinking about the broker, FXOPEN, do you know their GMT offset? It might not be the same as FXDD which is +3. You may need to change it in the ea popup for settings. That alone can make a huge difference in results.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
These settings do not necessarily trade every day. After all this is the 1hour chart. Looks like maybe 2 or 3 times per month on average per pair. But by having several pairs set up the frequency of trades should be increased. Theoretically, don't you just love that word?, 3 or 4 trades per week across the 7 pairs.

Hey all! Got up this morning and my fxdd malta demo had made 20 pips, the fxdd US hadn't opened a trade. When I checked the settings they were different.

For settings traders will need to attach the ea and then open the settings pop up and arrange their chart according to the particular settings for that particular pair if they want to follow along visually as the ea trades.

Use the attachments feature by using the paperclip in the corner. Jiva told me that you must add the indi's to match the settings on the set files if you want to see what the ea is doing. Hope this helps. Edit: You beat me to it Jiva! lol

That hi lo channel looks wrong. The ea is set correctly I can see from the comments But the channel on your template looks wrong. Should be hi lo 55. Yours looks like 200 or something. Also I use a color ma indi I can post it. I reallylike having the color change visible, takes a lot of guess work out. so ma should 34sma on chart. Other than that looks okay...

It's a race where everyone wins... Been thinking about the quant video, many thanks again. It may be that it is actually to our favor. Since the quants are very techincal. We are also technical. So it is a battle of the computers. Hilarious about how a program messed up somewhere and sold off a zillion shares of something and all the other computer freaked out... There's going to be more stuff like that happening. Now I see why the exchanges were rushing to become electronic. Now they even rent out space in the basement of the exchange at a premium of course, because data is received more quickly the closer the server is to the source. Really futuristic only thing is, it's now!!! Well we have our robot. Mr. Jivadragon. Ready to do battle... By the way Taiyakixz is quietly behind the scenes make some modifications that should help to improve the performance. He really is a genius. Such a nice job of coding. The ea is fast, neat and clean. He doesn't miss much. A real Sherlock.

looks about right. t3ma is not used in the gu settings, that's the wavy green line. If you don't want to see it, since we aren't using it here, you can open the pop up for settings and set t3ma to 0, t3ma should already be set to false.

jiva, which are the mains differences between V8.1 and v11? I am using v11 and it doesn’t take any trade, but instead v8.1 continues the profit way. Another thing; I suppose that you are very accustomed with the backtests procedures within your robot; is it too much to request if you could optimize your set files to alpari UK at the same time you are working to FXDD? sforma

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I was afraid someone would ask that... I can do some for Alpari. already there is one set for EURUSD for alpari.. It will take some time. Problem with Alpari is the testing cannot be done when the market is closed due to alpari variable spreads ... If I have time today. And during the week next week when market it open. Optimizing is very intensive, as you can imagine. Actually it would be nice to for Alpari, Taiyakixz uses that broker. Okay. I will do it. :nerd: v8? I'm trying to remember. I think there is not much difference between v8 and v11. Only difference may be that in v11 there is an option for dss true/false. For some setting we do not want to use dss...

the ea is very good in trends, but tends to not open trades at all in consolidations, also very good. So today maybe no trades...

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Jiva as you can see attached is a pdf file between your fxdd versus alpari set file for EUR/USD; the 3 arrows are the differences. Unfortunately with Alpari I can’t get 90% modeling quality and appears a lot of chart errors. Below is my backtest with your set file. I am still trying to understand how to optimize the quality test with alpari. Other issue; for basktest optimization, I usually select EMA, stoch and EmaPeriod and start from (for example) 0 to 100 with step of 25. And then according with the results I will reduce the mesh with minor step. Is it a good strategy or how do you perform it? Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #460 ---
well well looks like a little action today.. EURGBP opened long looking good... Hopped out manually. Realized I had the wrong set file loaded. It's a lot of little details. Easy to mess up on 1 or more of them.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Great to see taking an active interest. I think we have something extraordinary here. Time will tell. Is it Alpari demo platform or Alpari live platform for the running tester? Alpari demo platform has lots of problems!! Disconnects, incomplete data base in history, etc.. Alpari live platform is alright, I had to stop running Alpari demo for the ea, too many disconnects. Am US citizen so cannot have live account with Alpari. FXDD has served well. I find in order to get 90% I have to play around with the history downloads a bit. Download 1m, then download 5m, then download 1m again and run a test to see of 90% is there. If not I go back to history. Download 15m, 30m etc. the download 1m again. Run the test to see if 90%. By then it is usually 90%. But like I say Alpari demo platform is nasty. Maybe they just don't care about keeping it up and running nicely. Alpari live platform is okay. About optimizing. For these options what I do is just go down the list. Start with checking the box for take profit 1. Start at 17, 1 increment, end 75 (just for the heck of it) I was surprised to see how high a first target can be for some of these pairs.... then check the box next to trailing stop 1st tgt. Only one option to be optimized at a time. When I get to the 5 moving average settings I start with the daily first and work back to the 15 min. One at a time. Takes forever but the results are well worth the effort. I don't bother to try to optimize at all if I don't have a basic setting that I am already happy with. For me that means no losses for 12 months prior. That means the entries are good and to optimize means to make them even better by taking full advantage of an already good entry. Staying in the trade longer, etc. Good luck.

A lot of effort has been put into this ea and it really shows.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Noticing that some of the 1st targets are larger than what I have been used to. Instead of 20 pips, they are optimizing to 50 or 60 pips for a first target. am working on EURAUD and 1st target is easily 65 pips... stop loss 80.. That means these entries are very good entries.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Hi Jiva &amp; Co. I want to show your system proof :-) Yor're right about extraordinary pairs (here is first target set to 50 and looks soooo promising). Look at this beautiful setup.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
It is truly phenomenal!! These entries are so good!! Evidently the combination of all moving averages agreeing plus a breach of the hi/lo channel identifies them. If that isn't enough a couple of additional screens help like the dss and t3ma if necessary. Am working on EURAUD right now, blown away... The optimization is 4 times the basic setting... and the optimization isn't even complete yet... The markets are kind a sideways, kinda retracing so ea isn't pulling so many trades, but when things start to move again. Watch Out!! Just a note though: the stop loss is kind big for some of the settings, am working to bring them down. Some are down now from 200 to 70 or 80. The ea doesn't get caught in consolidations from what I have seen, thank you, but on rare occasions it will buy a top or sell a bottom. Ugh..We will work on seeing how to stop that... But it is not perfect 100% of the time, so watch your capital... Also margin requirements can be a bigggg problemmm...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I was in that EURGBP trade but had the wrong channel setting, messed up somehow, so jumped out. Somehow mine was set to 37and I didn't trust the entry (could have just checked it visually but didn't think of it at the time) and just jumped out. Evidently it didn't matter all that match about the channel setting since the ea took the trade with the right setting 55. Nice to see it working for you. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I am still flat this week also. I am on fxdd US server 5. It's funny because I had the wrong setfile last week on eu and was happy as a clam!

hi there Jiva, i'd like to congratulate you on the great work you are doing. i am testing your optimization for the EURGBP, and i could not replicate your results. i tried all the time-frames from 1m to 4h and the result was allways a negative net profit. i am using a live server, from fxdd malta, and using the latest version of the EA, and settings for this pair. :S any thoughts? thanks PS: is there anyone that is keeping record of the signals generated by the various settings of this EA, on the optimized pairs?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
???????????????????? I'm new at optimizing, to be honest about it. When I went back and ran the optimized settings again this time there were some losses, which didn't show up before. ??????????????? Results weren't negative but a lot less than the optimized test showed. So I am little confused now how to actually optimize the settings. I know someone I can I ask. So let me see what they have to say about how to do it most effectively. And also I can try doing some searches to get the information. Evidently I am not doing it quite right. So reminder: this is a great ea, the strategy is first class, but guess what it is still under development. Best to use on demo only and get familiar with how it works. Feedback like yours is much needed. Thanks... will get on it... Found a decent article on optimizing. Will need to do more research. http://www.easyexpertforex.com/backt...imization.html (edit ...few hours later) Strange, but then again working with the tester is a test in and of itself, the thing can be truly bizarre. I have gone back over the optimized settings and they all check out fine. Even EURGBP.. So I don't know where the problem is. Was the modeling quality 90% for every tick? How about the setting for gmt? for FXDD it should be +3... Can you post some results? the set file is for the 1h. Here's what I get: (what looks like a loss at the end of the gif is not a loss, the trade is still open but the tester will close an open trade at the stop loss, but the trade is not closed...)

Alright, I really don't know what some of you are doing but these are my results from last week with fxdd.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Great to hear from everyone. Wasn't sure if traders were actually taking an interest. Together we can get to this to where it needs to be. I guess you can see the potential. Anyone reading this, I would suggest not using real money just yet . Don't worry there will always be a chance to trade and make some money, but there are still a few things to iron out. We're darn close to a knockout ea... If we lose our capital because we rushed things and tried to make a killing while the ea is still under development and it surprises us with a bomb then we won't have that capital to invest when it is flying high. And I have no doubt we are very close to the high flying stage. I say this to remind myself as well. Tempting to just jump in...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi, The set file may not be quite right. So I don't think it is the spread. I think the 1st target needs adjusting. It may be too high. The entries are good. these settings are for 1hour chart.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I don't know why this happened. We can ask Taiyakixz to look at it. 500 pips??? What can and does happen sometimes: 2 positions are opened. There is a little time difference for their opening, if the market is moving quickly they will be opened at different prices. The ea opens a fixed stop loss set at a certain fixed amount. The stops will be different for the 2 positions since they were opened at different prices. The way the ea works: the closing of the 2nd position is dependent on the closing of the 1st to lock in profits. So when the 1st closes in profit the 2nd is then locked into profit also and there a number of ways to capture that gain, trailing stop, a breach of the channel, a fixed 2nd target etc. But if the 2nd falls back before the 1st reaches profit tgt, then it can stop out. If the price difference was significant when they were opened, the 2nd might close and the 1st not stop out and later go on to reach its profit tgt. Little complicated. Not sure what to do about it, if anything. In one sense it is a gift. Since they both could have stopped out and there would be no profit at all, both in loss.

Hi Jiva, I've tested your AUDCAD pair before opt and after also. In both of them I had 1 loss. I know, this could be caused by different broker I use (its data and GMT offset). Pls, could you chek my screen and compare to yours. What do you think about this particular trade? Can you post your screen from that 8th Feb 2010, that I can see the difference? Really appreciate all your effort here ;-)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
jeepers, creepers, looks like 1 pip difference in spread kept ea out of the trade on FXDD. It's a weak point for the ea, selling a bottom and vice versa buying a top. Since all the moving averages across the time frames are strong in agreement just before a reversal it can't tell that it is a reversal. Doesn't happen often, but for me once is too much. Would be nice to be able to weed that out. And we will be seeing how to do that. One thing that can detect a reversal is macd divergence. I have an indicator somewhere in my archives that will detect macd divergence. Maybe cci 14 could filter out that kind of undesirable entry. Short only below 0, long only above 0. I will spend a some time digging around. The ea does very well at staying out of consolidations! Thank you. Now the top and bottom thing, http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...SuRSfMB3wSmXk= Could try running optimizer for channel, try 35 to 40... instead of 34.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Rather than adding another condition to the mix, why not have trades automatically closed if the price hits the central green line? As you can see in your screenshot, once it is at that line, there is no realistic chance that it is then going to turn around and become a winning trade, so rather than waiting for it to hit the hard SL on the far side of that line, why not just close it when it hits the line instead?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Thank you for your input. The green line is the T3ma. In this one instance it appears that would work. I researched it a bit on your suggestion but what I found was it does not work as a general rule. Sometimes a perfectly good entry will retrace back over the T3ma before it heads for the moon. Also we do not use T3ma in many of the set files, sometimes it is more of a hindrance than a help, just depends on the pair being traded. The reason I want to look into the cci is because it has a bit of a predictive quality to it. Which is what we would need to identify if a reversal may be in the making. Yes I know adding more and more indicators gets way out of hand. This would be added as an option only. So for certain pairs it may be helpful. I would have to research this much more and then consult with Taiyakixz our programmer. But we are certainly open for ideas and suggestions.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Jiva I agree with you that it may not work all the time, but I think it would at least cut some of the losses short. Invisible

--- 帖子 #487 ---
We tried something similar several months back. That a trade would close if it crossed back over the channel. For example if a long position closed below the channel low before the 1st profit target was reached. Yes it did cut some losses short but it stopped many more good trades from reaching profit. Very often prices will retrace a bit before they take off. In the end it was more of a hindrance than a help. There was a whole series v7.0 through v7.8 or something like that devoted to testing this and a few other ideas. But in the end we scrapped the whole series and started over again from all the way back to v4 to build up. v11 is the best so far. There is also a v12 which I have not had the time to turn my attention to. I wanted to get v11 up and running and as functional as possible before trying to move on to anything else. I know the stop losses are big but we feel confident about the trades because the trend is so well defined. Only thing is the occasional top and bottom..

EURAUD trade opened...

--- 帖子 #490 ---
HI Jiva, here I want to post half success of EURGBP - after battle w/ reaching 1st target -&gt; it has finally reached it and still on its way to heaven :-)) Then I want to compare w/ you -&gt; my setup on EURAUD looks as nice as yours, but no trade opened. Now don't know, if there is a limitation, that only 1 trade of all pairs can be opened at one time or there was no all conditions in one row, when candle was opened above 53 EMA High one hour ago. Can you tell me how I can check if all MAs were up in the time of opening candle above 53 EMA channel? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
This is only my curiosity... Why is there loury face next to your EA in upper right corner? Looks like on this pair you have something enabled/disabled in your EA settings (was this trade opened automatically, or you should open it manually?) In your previous post w/ EURCHF it appears corectly (smiling face).

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Weird... Happy to hear you let the ea manage the EURGBP trade. Continuing on nicely!! For EURAUD: Why it didn't open... can you check the journal, maybe was a disconnect or requote or something... settings look fine. same as mine for FXDD (except your stop is 200, I have 80 but I'll check that mine may not be right) to see what the moving averages were doing in the past, you can mark with a vertical line on the 1 hour the entry candle. that vertical line will bleed through to the lower time frames (and higher time frames) and you can see what the moving averages were doing. The ea will not open a new signal if a trade is already in progress on a particular pair. So one trade at a time on a pair. But if it is set up on different pairs it will act individually on each pair. What about money management? If this is a live account was there enough margin to open another trade?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
The charts I am posting on the thread are on a different computer from where the ea is set up in my trading room. (I'm at work....shhhh..)

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi Jiva, I've checked w/ vertical line to lower and higher timeframes (all MAs were in up line), there was only one trade opened at that time (EURGBP), settings for EURAUD is up to date (your last optimized setting), there was not issue w/ margin, this is still demo account. Actually I didn't see in your thread any screenshot, where 2 or more trades were opened at the same time. But of course I believe you, that EA opens one trade per pair. So in this case don't kbnow what was causing the trade was not opened :-(

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi Which EA and which set files are the latest version as of now? Thank You WIlly

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi, check first page. There is all up to date.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Dunno... . As far as I know more than one trade can be open as long as it is not in the same pair. We'll see soon. Looks like AUDCAD, GBPUSD, and NZDUSD may all be setting up long. http://www.onebakersfield.com/wp-con...-fireworks.jpg

--- 帖子 #498 ---
okay NZDUSD just opened 2 positions long while at the same time EURAUD is still open. So answer definitively is: more than one trade as long as not the same pair... GBPUSD will come around too but it'll take a few more candles... Are we having fun yet? You bet!!! (edit several hours later) So much for fun.. I guess it's not time to get the party hats out yet.. NZDUSD has a generous positive rollover long so we don't mind waiting. There aren't that many trades in the sampling for 12 months, so not as confident of the settings as with some of the more active pairs like EURUSD, etc. So we shall see.

--- 帖子 #499 ---

Still thinking about that and maybe, maybe one think: I have restarted my PC, after updates were installed - but cannot confirm, that it was in the critical time/candle. But as I see your work her and EA performance w/ its result, I would rather blame myself or computer instead of your Dragon

Hi Jiva34, i have same issue as kapybara. It didnt open position at EUR/AUD and NZD/USD also. I m using collectivefx.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
can you post a screen shot showing the comments on the side? Kapybara remembers he may have turned off the computer for an update around the time of the trade. there are some reasons why a trade might not open. But the ea is working properly as far as I can tell. Smiley face is smiling in upper right corner? Is the broker you use an ECN? There are no issues with ECN, I don't think, Taiyakixz worked on that a while back. There are lots and lots of little details in trying to trade mt4 and then add lots and lots of more little details when you try to use an ea... they all have to be accounted for, or no go. But as far as I know the ea is working properly. My trades are opening and closing as they should. Not sure how to help you unless we can try to figure out if there is some detail in how you are setting up that needs adjusting. v11 from the first page and the set files posted there?

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I m using latest version and all set files are up to date. Collective is ECN broker, and mt4 is running on vps, so it is working all the time. Yesterday it opened long at EUR/CHF, but from that time nothing. I tryied tester and it looks all ok. Hmm I will run it on few demos, so it will be easier for me to compare. Do you think that it is possible cos of different data feeds?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Okay. So ECN is not the issue, since EURCHF opened. Different data feeds is always an issue. Sometimes spread differences can affect entries and exits also. Yes a few demos is a very good idea. It is surprising but even with same broker's demos all running the same time some trigger trades and some don't. It is strange. We have noticed this on another thread running an ea. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 What to speak of differences between different brokers... Just another one of those obstacles in trying to trade mt4 successfully.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
The EURAUD trade was very good. I manually exited a little early. A bad habit I have. And this is only a demo. I need to break that habit. Problem is I see some profit and I know it can disappear in a heartbeat so I jump out with a small gain. But the whole idea of the ea is stop that kind of thing by having confidence in the settings and let the ea manage the trade. So that is my confession. I have been able to break so many other self defeating bad trading habits so I have confidence this one will be gone too. At least I know it has to go. Building the confidence in the ea is how I will be able to let go. So more practice.

Good night all. I'm new in this forum and put the following EA according to the rules. Set out in the initial post. My broker is 4XP and so far no order run. My bill is ECN, a problem? jiva34, congratulations on the excellent work.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Welcome aboard. No credit, please... just cash ECN is not a problem. The ea looks for trending. So if the market is sideways or retracing there won't be any trades opened.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hello, Thank you for testing. I found the reason....You set TakeProfit2=0. In this case, EA tries to set tp to the same price as open price. It failes, then EA sets sl at the same time, it also fails. So order2 starts with no sl and tp. I will modify it, but at the moment, please set TakeProfit1 and 2 to enough large value....

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I'm back Jiva, 1 H is a good choice. I like it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
I always thought, that Robby DSS indicator is total BS.. Maybe better choice to go with regular MACD or Stoch.. That DSS sometimes pointed up when Trend is down and vise versa.. It's useless, but this is just MHO..

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Yes I agree. dss is bit too "free floating?" for lack of a better way to describe it. I favor macd generally. I am looking into how accurate it might be to use the direction of the signal line as an indicator for long or short rather than dss. We have to be very certain before requesting Taiyakixz to embark on a coding sojourn. He is our most valuable resource. I will put time into this over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
These may be a classic example of the "buy near the top" variety that we want to be able to screen out. dss is not helpful in these cases. dss can help to define an ongoing trend but does not generally give much of a hint of a reversal or retracement. Sometimes it very misleading also. Like Skyzer says points up when move is obviously down and vice-versa.. Whereas macd very often will give dependable information. I am looking here at the direction of the macd signal line (red). Up go long, down go short along with confirmation of the moving averages. These are just 2 cases, so I will have to see if this as general rule is effective in most cases. A bigger sampling... These 2 trades are in progress. So the final outcome is not known yet. But as of now they are trades I would have preferred the ea had not taken.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Welcome, friend. It's starting to get really good....

--- 帖子 #521 ---
EA has opened these two orders in the middle of AU 0:01 pm today. I stopped to see how it will end. Soon after the conditions were unfavorable. But I'll wait to see how he reacts. The other order was in the U.S. manual.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
You are trading 24 hours? the settings did best set for gmt+3 at 0 to 16... demo I hope...

--- 帖子 #523 ---
These conditions do not seems to be correct: &amp;&amp; ( Use_DSS == false || dss1 &gt; dss2 ) &amp;&amp; ( Use_T3MA == false || t3ma1 &gt; t3ma2 ) &amp;&amp; ( CheckSlope == false || NormalizeDouble( emah1, pipsDigits ) &gt; NormalizeDouble( emah2, pipsDigits ) ) if Use_DSS is set to true, the dss1 and dss2 are never checked and hence DSS is not used at all; same logic for Use_T3MA and CheckSlope

--- 帖子 #524 ---
This is correct. Because '||' means 'or'. If Use_DSS is false, ( Use_DSS == false || dss1 &gt; dss2 ) is always true. This means that dss1 &gt; dss2 is not checked. If Use_DSS is true, ( Use_DSS == false || dss1 &gt; dss2 ) depends on 'dss1 &gt; dss2'. This means that dss1 &gt; dss2 is checked.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Sure I'll fix that. Thanks

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Studying how the macd using just the signal line would affect trades. Very good so far. signal line up long, signal line down short along with other confirmation of course. So we have requested Taiyakixz if he will code it into the ea as an option. Sometimes we use both dss and macd sometimes one or the other sometimes neither one, depends on the price action of the pair. If the ea can identify the really good entries then we can be more confident about staying in the trade longer... Macd should help with this.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Just diddling around a bit tinkering etc waiting on the macd coding and wow!! this ea is a super powerhouse. We haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what this can do. This is a 15 min setting for EURUSD (FXDD). And we don't even have the macd yet!! I have a little more time and out of curiosity want to see what it looks like going back a few years more...just curious.... edit.. Going back 3 years not the same sweet results, different market conditions.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
A simple opinion to add to this great topic of dedicated traders. The alignment of indicators would be a great help to refine more entries. Look at the images in h1, m30 and m15. The entry in position so happens when all these tfs are aligned, ie all indicators are pointing in all tfs fall or rise. In the images disregarded the channel with the MAs. Put a red vertical line to show the alignment.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Very nice work Jiva and Taiyakixz. .

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Interesting. The lining up of the indicators strategy indicates a short entry and the ea using the current strategy has entered long...with a required macd confirmation on the current time frame the long entry would not have been made. Let us keep this in mind. Gotta be considerate of Taiyakixz. These are tremendous coding endeavors... Maybe we could study some more charts manually to be sure something like that was worth his brain strain. At some point I would love to be able to test mtf indicators...vis-a-vis mtf moving averages.. Great input... For now building on v11 we are adding the macd and it will need to line up with dss stoch on the current trading time frame and the mtf moving averages for an entry to be confirmed. That may be enough. Let us see..

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Just checking in and I have a thought. Moving averages and macd tell the same thing, so shouldn't you use a different kind of indicator?? Once again I am no whiz on indi's as I am a pa junkie. Perhaps a road less traveled as an rsx as I know Taiyakixz is aware of. Just a thought and please disregard if I am out of line.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Not out of line in the least. This ea is "the house that Jack built" if you know what I mean. I have no originality whatsoever....It is put together by the generosity of ideas and sharing that takes place in the forums... http://john.curtin.edu.au/aspiration...arliamentl.jpg For some reason macd identifies changes in trend just a tad bit differently than the "plain vanilla" moving averages. It has a predictive quality to it which is well know by those who like to watch for divergences. Can you post a link for rsx?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I agree, very good MACD to identify trends. Look where the red line is outside the lines in chured macd and put a case in which Stochastic is also showing fall. Good entry opportunity.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Here is the link to rsx downloads. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...stcount=175862 I am more familiar with the macd settings that Phillip Nel taught for his 4hr macd method. Regardless, I'm for whatever works. I've just been doing some studying with fudomyo in his thread and the rsx can be really predictive with the right settings etc.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
All's well that ends well. The trades from Friday for EURUSD and NZDUSD have taken a turn for the better. My confidence in the ea increases. EURUSD closed reaching both targets not without coming within a pip's-breath of stopping out. NZDUSD is trying to reach it's targets..

--- 帖子 #536 ---
So many little details. Easy to make a mistake. But sometimes the mistakes turn out to be something that opens up a whole new area to be researched. In the NZDUSD settings I noticed that somehow or other, I had one of the moving averages set for a shift 4. I had no intention to do that. It was a slipup. But it tested very nicely. Without that shift 4 not so good. so I went back and optimized NZD for shifts in moving averages. Surprising results. I guess this all comes under the heading of "curve fitting". So we shall see how it goes. Not to unnecessarily confuse things this is the NZDUSD set optimized for moving averages with shift.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Jiva congradulations on your teriffic work on your dragon ea . It sure looks like you put a lot of work into it, and looks like you got some good help here to make it even better.

Shame on me!!! I did it again. I jumped out after a scary pullback. The only thing I can think of to get me over panicking like this is to work more with the ea and develop the confidence that it is managing trades successfully. NZDUSD is going on to be successful it looks... It's the old bug-a-boo of taking a few pennies profit out of fear of losing it, and holding on to the losers hoping they will turn around until they get a margin call... The ea is meant to get rid of all of that. I guess it will still take me a little time to surrender to an "expert adviser".

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Please am trying to use the EA on demo but it is not working. I have loaded the set files to each separate templates but still it is not picking any trades. What should i do, thanks for all the good work. Jiva

Hi Jiva, 1st post here, thanks for posting your EA for us to test. I use Alpari UK, am i correct in assuming that only EU, EC, EG are optimized for Alpari UK at the moment? Thanks

--- 帖子 #545 ---
The ea does not trade all the time. Only when there is an appropriate set up, that could be maybe 2 times/month per pair. Post a screen shot of one of your chart setups so we can see the comments and settings... Maybe we will see something there that needs to be corrected...

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Yes those three have been tested for Alpari and the results were good, no losses for past 12 months...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
you must to type correct GMT offset for your broker and wait. For me it didnt pick any trade today, be patient and wait This EA trades few times per month. You can run strategy tester to be sure that everything is ok.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks for the fast response. I will update you on my progress with these 3 pairs on Alpari UK (no trades yet today!) Keep up the great work

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Great. Welcome aboard. When I get some time I will try to get some more pairs ready for Alpari.

When the candles enter the hi lo channel there is a good chance for setup to take place. Watching EURUSD15m, the only 15m setting we have. 15 minutes settings will trade much more frequently than the 1hr settings. So of course I would like to get more pairs setup for 15min time frame.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Several pairs flirting with their hi/lo channels EURCAD, GBPUSD, EURGBP, EURUSD on the 1 hours. Perhaps some good setups tomorrow. Trader hour ends for the ea at noon NY. Tuesday and Weds seem to be great days for trades in general.

I am using the first settting # and setting it that way to start. Why do you have so many setting and when you have false or true and you have a # I just leave it at default.

The ea needs a trending market. Otherwise it won't open any positions. that's good we don't want to get caught in a sideways market. I like that saying, "Better to be wishing you'd gotten in, rather than wishing hadn't gotten in". so even though the pairs are dipping in and out of the hi lo channels it's all still sideways. The multi time frame moving averages will identify when there is actually a trend worth risking a trade. So maybe nothing for a few days. We can wait. And be ready for when it's right. We have lots to do to get ready.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi Jiva, I do think what you are building here is great however I do have problems with the backtesting you are doing. With only 50-60 trades over a year you can optimize to find the perfect combination of variables that gives you perfect upward sloping profit lines like the ones you have been displaying HOWEVER these results are not statistically significant because the 1yr window of data you have chosen to optimize on is not representative of all types of market conditions. I realise it is no easy job to find high quality data to do longer tests over but to be a REALLY great EA the same .set file should be able to be run on any given year and although not be a star performer sometimes it shouldn't destroy the account either. To illustrate this point please see the attached screenshot showing the backtest from Jan 2009 to Oct 2010 using your eumtf1hopt.set file which you optimized Oct09-Oct10. You will notice that I had to run the backtest using an initial deposit of 100k rather than 10k as the 10k was wiped out before we got half way into 2009! It will come as no surprise that the period you optimized for was trade 66 onwards. That doesn't mean to say the EA is not good - the problem is if you continue to best fit your variables over such a small timeframe then you will find a model that always does amazingly well if the market is VERY similar to what we have seen over the coming months but possibly wipes out your account if it does not. The only solution is to optimize over the longest period you can and although the charts you produce won't look so beautifully smooth you should be able to have more confidence that you won't lose all your money either. Good luck, I do think you are going down the correct route and the MACD may well filter out some of the mess - but try hard to capture at least the last 3 yrs in your optimizations and then hope that when you run that .set file over longer periods you don't get any surprises - then you will have a truly robust methodology. Cheers Jono

Thank you. I totally agree. That's next. Reminder: I hope no one is actually using real money at this point!! We are definitely not ready for real money yet, as inviting as it may seem. I have all confidence that we will be ready soon. Whatever it takes, no stone unturned, we'll get there...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
This is a very central point about expert advisers. When the market conditions change they can lose their "wisdom" and eat an entire account balance in about 3 gulps. so how to deal with this. JM211o has very kindly brought this to the forefront while I am having a great old time optimizing perfect "curve fitting" settings. Something Taiyakixz has been hounding me about for months. You are mostly "curve fitting" he chides. Anyway, we all will agree there must be some "curve fitting", so I'm getting really good at!!! But how do we deal with the inevitable, change in market conditions? JM offers that backtesting and curve fittng for at least 3 years will offer some protection. The graph won't be so pretty, there will be dips but overall an account balance will be protected and most likely show some profit if the ea has any statistical edge to it at all. At first glance this looked like the solution. But then my "evil" mind taunted, "There is no guarantee that simply going out 3 years would offer protection from changing market conditions. Maybe the market would change after 3 years and the optimized setting for 3 year period would become ineffective". I n other words a curve fit for 1 year or a curve fit for 3 years or even 5 years would all have the same inherent short coming of becoming ineffective at some point. The problem is not knowing when that point of ineffectiveness occurs until the losses start!!! So 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years!! All the same problem. What to do? What I am thinking, and I share it with the forum, is that market conditions most likely do not change overnight (of course we get those wild spike and dips but I mean serious change over an extended period of time), they begin to change gradually as the participants adjust to the new economic environments. So by performing optimizations regularly, on a daily basis would be superb... then whatever changes are occurring should be gradually incorporated into the optimized curve settings. Not go out a million years, but zoom in on a day to day basis if possible, if not daily, then surely a weekly optimization should account for any changes in market conditions as they happen staving off losses. If that were the procedure it might be possible to optimized for 6 months instead of 12 months and get an even higher profit curve. But 12 months seems reasonable. 6 months might be introducing a bit more of a risk factor than we might want. With higher profits comes higher risk. It's already risky enough!!! But we can research it a bit at some point. Any thoughts on this. It's really central to using an ea.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
As an after thought. This makes sense, to perform the optimization regularly. The strategy is sound and will hold up in any market condition. This I am fairly certain of. And of course as we continue on this will seen either true or false. So if the strategy is sound then it is merely certain parameters that will change. The intensity of the of trend for instance, or the volatility. One reason I believe the strategy is sound is that it has been applied to 10 different pairs that all trade slightly differently and with the right settings backtests profitably in all 10, and generously so. If the pairs trade differently, and they do, and the strategy holds for all 10 pairs, that is it keeps its statistical edge, then it should hold in different market conditions also. And it would simply be a case of making slight adjustments as we go. Maybe it is that traders want to set an ea up and forget about it. But maybe that is not the way to use an ea. Just like buy and hold stock investing is no longer practical. So set and forget may not be the best use of an ea. Maybe set and regularly monitor and adjust as needed is the best route. So set and forget for a few days maybe... But not set and forget for a year or 3 years!! Not if we want to make some serious money.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Absolutely agree. I think in Forex doesn't exist system, which is announced and sold for bunch of money, which can be set and forgett.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Watching the trades and studying them in the back tests what seems to be happening is the ea does not necessarily catch the first break out in a long term trend. Or what might be seen in wave theory as the 1st wave, which isn't usually the biggest move. The ea very often catches an entry on a pullback. And rides what can be seen as the 2nd wave or 3rd wave which is usually the stronger moves in a trend. Because all the moving averages need to be lined up for an entry, it won't necessarily be able to enter on the initial breakout since the moving average on the high time frame hasn't had a chance to turn yet. So it catches trades in the middle of the trend. Very good..... We want that. Only weakness is sometimes it might buy a top or sell a bottom. I want to work with macd which we now have in v14, thank you, Taiyakixz, not posted yet but is in testing to see if we can stop that. Since the market is a little sideways and retracing now we might not get any trades for a while.

Have you considered automating a "built-in" dynamic set file to any EA? What I suggest is as RR has shown in his "Old Dog new tricks" Thread? Traders agree (1) optimization is necessary to give best performance results, and (2) markets for each pair change over time, thus outgrowing the EA's. If an EA can be coded it would seem logical an internal module to any EA could contain capabilities to self optimize using various dynamic measurements. One approach short of neural network applications would be to adjust the architecture of EA to variable mtf look back tables (PA) from which calculations could maintain in-turn variable set files. This could be done weekly, or bi-weekly or monthly using a standard 5 trade day week. Updates could be run after market hours (weekends) or every fourth week, etc. We have been fighting a losing battle (in most EA's) with static programming following lagging indicators.....! If we moved from static setting parameters needing manual optimization to flexible set adjusting methods the EA's built on approaches moving in concert with market price movements may be a worthwhile direction involving toward "real hands-off" or longer term non-intervention? Just thoughts.... Atlas1

Hello Jiva34 and everybody at the Thread this is my first post, I am a Newbie in Forex, I have been trading for less more than 6 months, and have been reading Forexfactory's Threads since 3+ months I am very interested in your system and have started testing EA in EUR/USD H1 since yesterday, Demo account with Instaforex , Good results since then, I also tryed to backtest EA with "EurUsd" but no success maybe is because I run MT4 plataform inside Linux, anyway Thanks for your priceless Effort and your good will with all of us . If there is a Way I can contribute this System and Thread I will , Please be so kind of pointing what I can be usefull to help. (I am graphic designer, Web and Linux programmer) maybe a "logo" for this incredible EA could help people here and elsewhere to trigger mentally here, just an idea) _______________ Sequoia

Yes, a real trap for new traders. How to make money with an ea: sell it with hyped up promises!! If their ea is so great why do they even want to bother with marketing, production and selling for $49. Why don't they just use their own ea and make millions every day like they advertise. Please, give us a break...

--- 帖子 #583 ---
For now what I can do is regularly optimize the settings listed on the first page. EURUSD and EURGBP 1h FXDD were last optimized 10/16, so I can do those two before Frankfurt opens. And see if there are any significant changes in the settings. So just keep track of things like that for now. Do one or 2 per day as their settings become a week old. And see what the changes are... if any.. Research possible options to get this resolved to satisfaction. v14 is under testing also, it has the macd added with a variety of ways to use it. and 3 more moving average options... We want to stay with v11 for some time, v14 won't be posted until it is really ready to roll, settings and all. Could be a while.. No need to rush. v11 is very good... Lots going on...

--- 帖子 #584 ---
First Of all thanks very much Jiva34 for the Kind and Warm welcome message , I have made the first beta-logo, I think graphics are a little bit saturated, if anyone have any ideas to improve it are welcome (or I could make a brand new one ). I completely agree with what you said some posts above, I think this system has a very promising future , and by adapting input settings, when market changes its nature (as you said aswell) this system will be just invincible. We could also make an auto-improving system, not inside this great EA, maybe only another EA with an excel sheet output, where we can see for example : how much pips are moving since the system's rules fro an entry are trigered, etc. .statistics for a 3 month's basis (just to call some time period) , obviously with this incredible system's rules. (maybe with M15 time frame too) This could adapt better: entries, SL and TP for each pair's future sentiment . when they change, and even make your work of improving settings easyer. Please forgive me if I am saying nonses here (maybe only backtesting would work) just a humble idea to provide something usefull to your great system too . Thanks for hard work . I hope you like this first beta-logo, I think I can make a much better one for the future, critics are welcome. Have a great day everybody. ________________ Sequoia

HI jiva when i try to back test i get cannot open file in journal . i get the same thing on two different broker. I left everthing default except offset time for broker any idea what i am doing wrong or need to do right

--- 帖子 #588 ---
send me an email with the files attached that you are using... if you load the preset into the mt4 popup for settings you shouldn't have any problems... I think you might be trying to set the settings individually by using a word program to open the set file. The set file needs to be unzipped so it appears as .set file then it can be loaded directly into the mt4 popup. Sometimes we might get stuck in a rut in our thinking. By practicing using these programs it will help us to think in news ways. Actually it will force us to think in new ways. Good mental exercise. And then put the pressure of win or lose at stake and watch out, engine fired up.

Nice.. Very nice.. It is like heraldry almost. Interesting. Like a coat of arms or something. I am partial to green. Can we use green somehow? What would it look like red, green and gold instead of blue? Just curious. The little gold dragons on the bottom, facing left and right are a little indistinct, kind of fuzzy...clean them up? I like how the dragon has captured the globe, usually we see him trying to capture it. Here he has hold of it. And the 2 dragons, like long and short, win and lose, ying and yang, very nice. The v11 is muddy color, maybe brighter. Dragons can come closer together? Thank you. Much appreciated.

OK Jiva, here is a perfect example you have shown from manual backtesting optimization. First, with thoughts of coding (duplication) write down each step you take to do the manual optimization shown above. Secondly, once you have thought through and documented the traditional routine to reach the results you show above, then approach MetaCoder with the task of (1) duplicating in automatic form your results, and (2) once you have this code working to automate your optimization routine on one single pair, take it to the next level (which MetaCoder should be attracted to the challenge) do this on a 'basket' approach. I like the abstract approach and style of MetaCoder, as he sees far beyond the linear view of normal code styles. Look to his stated challenge....that of working with a multiple pair basket of application hypothesis. He is very good and discerns fully the multiplicity of analysis to make a multiple pair basket perform profitably. However, one has to be able to replicate the manual procedure first, just a a manual trader must see clearly his method and define it in detail, before the EA is created, so does moving to the next higher step need documentation of parameters to combine the automatic replication of on pair's optimization before it can be combined for the total basket application. One positive move would be to use the approach of RR where he works off tic data PA history rather than the typical M1 TF history. Once you have a tic history file one can compare how close you come to 99% accuracy in running on past PA tic data. This is much more accurate than the traditional Mt4 back test routine for the single pair, x time frame, etc. Primarily you wish to automate your manual backtest procedure for a single pair to lessen you load as you now backtest. With this in mind, think "dynamic" and not "Static" conditions. The idea is to enlist aid from the likes of MetaCoder, or his equal (few available and he is like the 'trend'..your friend!). Get his input and tell him what you wish to accomplish with his help but to do it in concert with his foresighted intuitive objective analytical talent. I feel he is the right talent to enlist in your automated optimization method. Once this is working and proven to replicate your manual results, then take it to the next step where you with aid of MetaCoder devise how to include this automated optimization routine into your EA. And, in final form MetaCoder can take it to the highest stage, to combine it into a basket optimization technique from which he can compare different baskets to find those having maximum 'strength to weakness' characteristics where dominant price shifts prevail.....the big payoff! First you have to automate the normal optimization routine. Use it to enhance performance stats on your EA. Then work to have a module applicable to other qualifying EA's (in the MetaCoder format) and lastly bridge the single basket approach with "X" pairs to multiple baskets to offer a comparative analysis at optimum setting more than one basket! Thus, the ultimate shift procedure for your own EA (and others to follow). The shift (in thinking) is from single linear pair manual computations to automatic single pair optimizations, then to multiple pair automatic optimizations and finally to the comparative results of multiple basket optimizations. This is the challenge and direction MetaCoder is excited about moving toward ( by his own definition). It is exciting and very challenging, to say the least! Basically, you are much better off in only making the first step, to automate you manual methods of optimization even if you don't move upward and onward from that step. What an improvement in time spent for you if the automation were dynamic within the EA? Man, you would be light-years ahead of the pack! IMO Atlas1

I see. I see. (Said the blind man, as he picked up his hammer and saw). It will take a little time to assimilate. But I see the direction. We'll get there. Yes first step to automate is to get the pattern down. I am at that stage now, you have picked up on it perfectly. How to optimize optimally, so to speak. what to optimize first and what to optimize by itself and what parameter to optimize in conjunction with another parameter, etc,.. what and in what is order is significant. I understand your point about pairs individually and also optimizing for which pairs. It is a tremendous amount of time and work to optimize the settings, if this could be automated it would be invaluable. Something like the step up from staring at the monitor to look for set ups all day and having an ea monitor the pairs. Well then the ea itself would need to be monitored. So we are looking to a FULLY automated system. Quant challenge, hey? I need to be monitored. It's getting good..... I may not be able to visit Old Dog until this weekend.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
These 1hr settings do not trade very often. 2 or 3 times per month per pair. With v14 and the addition of macd parameters it may be possible to research settings on the 30 min or even 15 time frames which usually means much more trading activity. It is good to have the 1hr series with attractive settings ready to set up and monitor before trying to go on to something new. So we will get v11 to a good place first.

What would green and gold look like instead of blue and white, no offense, but the blue and white dragon sort of reminds me of a skunk. So much for a warm welcome, all I've done is pick apart your logo...Maybe I should post on the first page "ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!" I really do like your idea and even the first draft. Hope your not discouraged. Let's work on it. Maybe the traders have some ideas. http://www.saynotocrack.com/wp-conte...8/07/skunk.jpg

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I like the more red and no blue. But not good color green. Dark color green on belly, gold or yellow stripe like on the red one, and then light green back Looks like you wanted to make them exact opposites. But what I am asking is not exactly opposite. What do you think? dark green not so mossy color, more forest green, light green not so yellowish. they look good closer together, like really challenging each other. the small dragons look better, but they need something. Maybe an eye? Where are their "globes"? the shadow effect is good, it's subtle so we don't notice it right away, but it is nice. Thank you for your good work. To give more character to the ea. Make it more personal. Yes we want to get good settings for lower time frames (more trades) but it is harder to do. More volatility. I have an idea how to do it and will put some time into it. 2 trades/month is very slow. The other thing I suspect is that they will all trade together. That is, when the market gets a strong direction to it they will all signal trades within a few hours of each other. So who has enough margin to carry all those trades at once? So that makes the lower time frames even more attractive since that is not as likely to happen on a lower time frame. Shorter trades and there would be more of a space between the different pairs' signals.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Anyone set up for GBPUSD? My work station was shut down due to storms. But it should have triggered long. Close of last candle, gmt 9 I believe. Am placing the trades manually to monitor. update 5 hours later: GBPUSD doesn't have a 200 pip stop loss for no reason. Let's see if it bounces off the trend line and goes in the favor of our ea's decision. update next trading day just before London: Can it be? Or is it an apparition? GBPUSD is moving in the right direction! update: don't you just love GBPUSD, the most volatile pair.. I've noticed this in several of the ea's trades. More often than can be considered mere coincidence. The limits correspond to supports and resistances, but were not calculated from supports and resistances, per se. They were calculated from "curve fitting" over the last 12 months months for optimal limits... Interesting. Maybe there is more to this "curve fitting" than some traders are giving it credit for.

Jiva, I want to add some value here in your thread as well. Try those 3 indies on H4 Check it out this is just perfect compare to Robby DSS.. Also add MTF_Fractal_Channel and use TF 1 TF up (if on H4 use 1440).. Should look like on my screen shot very accurate signals..

--- 帖子 #606 ---
MTF_Fractal_Channel use the Icustom indicator FractalChannel_v4.mq4

--- 帖子 #607 ---
ah.....I like fractals...at the moment I don't know how to include it to the strategy, but it's one possible good idea.... Because all indicators which the ea use are related to the calculation of moving averages, another view may be the key to improve the strategy. Many members come to the thread....thanks for interesting and opinion. They are very good opinion. I didn't reply but I have thought about them a lot... I have thought about curvefitting for long time, I think it's the biggest problem, we have to solve them.... Sequoia, thank you for great logo. It's professional work. the day before yesterday snow fell here....winter is coming....

Better green coloring. Still a little off. Green is hard color to work with I think. What would the green dragon look like with the dark green on the belly like the red dragon with the dark red on the belly? The small dragon on the right is covered by the background. He should be in foreground? The green dragon could use some outlining, like the red dragon has some dark outlining to help define. the green dragon maybe could have a gold eye? or some other color more vibrant? The only green in the logo is in the green dragon. He seems a bit unconnected. Is there a way to intertwine some green somewhere else too so he seems more part of things? There is some white streak on the green dragon's face? I like the beams emanating from the globes. Nice touch of pizazz. Very good talent you have. Thank you for offering it for the Dragon. Let us see if Dragon can "pay" you back...

Fantastic. Nothing static about this logo.. couple of things: Black background!! yes 1.Red dragon, in his tail maybe a little flair of red, like the green dragon has a flare of white? 2. the spray of green in the bottom part is good, makes the green dragon like he is more a part of things. But maybe the spray of green could be a little more vibrant, like it is in the logo with the white background. 3. the small dragon on bottom left needs a little shadow like one on right. 4. The green dragon's eye is now very good, but now the red dragon's eye is dull. How can we sparkle the red dragon's eye? yellow might get lost in all the yellow he already has? Maybe brighter red orange? 5. I like the 2 tone background with it looks like the hint of short behind red dragon and long behind green dragon. But the curve is not quite right somehow. Everything is more or less balance in the logo but the curve is not. Yes I know that is realistic, isn't it! But for visual soothing effect it is unbalanced. Can we make it more symmetrical without giving things a flat manipulated look? Maybe it would be enough to just bring the dividing line between gray and black down to left corner like it goes up to the right corner and leave the curve in the middle as it is? You are right, having a nice logo like this really perks things up. Brings character to the project. And it really is a beauty. If I stare at it long enough I go into an altered state of consciousness.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi Taiyakixz, I want to say thank you for all your effort here, your skills and work you have given to this system is tremendous I have small input for you. What about adding parameters w/ possibility to hide SLs and TPs, so broker cannot see them? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I think we all agree that the two major issues for this (and all other) EA is firstly improving entries and secondly optimizations or finding the best variable mix for profitability. Currently the best fit optimizations for this model involve the stop loss being much larger than a relatively tight take profit level. This is consistent with 90% of successful EA’s- as soon as you achieve 80-90% winners you can be fairly sure of having a profitable looking model. Even better with such a high percentage winners (and therefore your average consecutive winners being around 1) you can be fairly sure that if you do just one stage martingale given the fact with 90% winners you are very unlikely to get two loses in a row that you will keep that smooth upward sloping profit line. So we spend 95% of our time on ForexFactory thinking about how best to optimise our entry points where all we are really doing is playing a statistics game on our profit level vs. our stop level. The first thing I usually do when testing an ea is set the TakeProfit and StopLoss settings to the same distance from the entry price and then run the model and see what % winners we get. Last time I did this on this EA (with from memory 40 pip stop and profit on the EU) I got 53% winners so close to a coin toss. That isn’t unusual. So all we really are doing here (so far) is arbitraging the relative distances between our stop and profit levels. I am sure if Taiyakixz was bored he could replace the entry signal with a random buy/sell that traded 3 times a month and then we would still be able to optimise our other variables to show that it is a good model. Don’t worry this isn’t a criticism as I said it is what 90% of all EA’s advertised on the web do. I do think you should keep this in mind however when you start filtering your entries with MACD etc. The only real way to work out if you are gaining an “edge” with your model is to keep those SL and tp at the same width and then hopefully you will see your winners % rise. That doesn’t mean to say when we run live we want or need to have our SL and TP levels similar as the fact you can get a high % of winners by moving the SL wider is valid – I just don’t want Taiyakixz wasting his time programming massively progressively complicated entries when all we are generating could be replaced by a coin toss. Test your entry validity with similar TP and SL then once you are happy you have an edge widen them out to lift the % winners even further. A few here have suggested rolling automatic optimization as a way of improving the model. I really don’t think this is any more valid to what you are already doing – curve fitting a small period of data. With so few trades occurring over the fitting period you will usually be able to find a variable fit that will show a nice smooth upward sloping line. The fact Paul (the now famous) octopus could accurately predict the outcome of the world cup matches shows you that with a small number of results (36 trades a year , or a few football matches) and large flexibility in variables (stop vs profit levels or who knows how many animals they tried that didn’t get the right results) that we can optimize to fit anything. Now if that octopus had to pick football matches over the past few years then we may have found it on the sushi counter long before it was as the only way to see if signals (our model) is any good is to provide it with the largest sample size we can and then see if we can then find mix of its’ variables that best fit every situation. So in short I feel rolling optimizations are no more valid than what you are currently doing, whether you sample the last week, month or year and do it every week you still can’t be sure that the market the following week isn’t going to squash you. HOWEVER if you have optimized over the largest data set you have (from what I have seen that seems to be 1999-2010) and you have some variables that consistently make money then you can be confident that in the long run the model should be ok...even if next week causes a drawdown you know how far the drawdown SHOULD go and how long on average it will take before you SHOULD recoup your loss. Birt on his site http://eareview.net/ is fantastic at doing such tests on commercial robots and there are a few that pass his test of showing consistent profitability over many years. That doesn’t mean to say they will be profitable next week or month but I would have much more confidence that something that has been profitable over so many changing market conditions WITHOUT changing its variables will come back to profitability again in the future and would be much more likely to put a EA like that live onto my account than one which needed to tweak it’s variables every few weeks or months. So I really think the only way to know you have built something great is when you find a .set file that you can run over any data period and although not always hitting home runs will suffer minimal drawdowns while surviving anything the market has thrown at it. This may of course be impossible however a few have managed it so I feel time is better spent improving entry signals (i.e. high % winners over longest data sets) rather than going down the complicated auto optimizing route for little or no long term benefit. In my opinion if the model has to be constantly changing its’ variables then it isn’t a robust model at all - all we have is a complicated box with enough variables that we can fit any data set in isolation – and an octopus can do that. Jono

Thank you for taking the time to explain your understanding for us. I am considering very carefully the points you have presented. I want to do the test of sl and tp you described. Am curious to see what kind of statistical edge the basic strategy has. I think it will rate a high percentage of wins. I believe the basic strategy is sound. Will have some time this weekend. Thanks again. There is a saying in the sales world, "You learn the most from your toughest customer"... http://static.indianexpress.com/m-im...1946_Paul_.jpg

--- 帖子 #624 ---
ummm....to be honest I don't like hidden TP and SL because they are delayed and have some different pips, but I know many members want to avoid broker's stop hunting.... It will be included in the future....it will take time because the ea has very complex orders so at the moment the ea uses normal TP and SL....

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Willy, think about it.. Suppose you have 5 instances of EA running on the same account, then you need to calculate total risk from all 5 EA, what if there is 4 or 7 running? So it's impossible to calculate.. Just take pencil and figure out how many EA's are running and set appropriate lot size, based on SL.

--- 帖子 #626 ---

good stuff!! FXDD didn't trigger. Sometimes small differences in brokers makes big differences in trades. update Can you believe it!!! I did all that optimizing for NZDUSD and then forgot to reset my own charts!! That's why the trade didn't get placed. So many details...

--- 帖子 #629 ---
You illustrated my point beautifully here Jiva. The only reason you made money on this trade was that your SL was further from your entry than your take profit level. In fact the entry signal was pretty damn bad due to the fact that very quickly after you put the trade on it went significantly against you....in fact if you had been given a sell signal there we would have been thinking "damn that thing is good". But all's well that ends well and as I said playing the statistical game due to the stops being further away than the profit levels is a legitimate strategy as this example shows. I look forward to the results of your testing this weekend using equidistant stops and profit levels as I think you will be surprised how close to 50:50 the entries are. If we can get that success ratio in the 65% area you really have something to play with but I am afraid when we backtest over longer dated data that is a VERY difficult thing to do.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Well, yeah, cause MACD was below ZERO and RED at that point. Robby DSS messing things up.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I know exactly what you are talking about. You can do fabulous with a stop loss of 2000 with absolutely no strategy at all until it gets hit, back to zero or less. Like Russian roulette. Never know when the bullet will be in which chamber. Which trade will be the killer. Gambling. But if the strategy is good then bigger wins than losses then the trader has an edge over breakeven. Flip a coin, comes up head win 100 comes up tails lose 50. In the end come out ahead. Martingale system tries to take advantage of the principle. Have to have very deep pockets for Martingale. But even with Martingale there is no guarantee there won't be a trade that gets caught to the umpteenth level.... From my understanding there are 2 different approaches to trading. 1. high probability of success with lots of small gains and rather large stop loss that is hit infrequently. 2. few trades but with large gains and small stop loss that gets hit frequently. If a strategy is good and gives an edge over flipping the coin then either of those approaches will work equally well.

Sorry about this: Details got away from me. This test was done with a v14 which has not been posted yet. It has the macd filter on it. to run this test on v11 which is what is available to the traders as of now it will not give the same results. this test needs v14 and we are not ready yet to make it available it yet. My mistake. I make a lot of them. I have been experimenting with a 5 min setting. The saying is there has never been a strategy that can trade the 5min successfully. I have tried as jm2110 has suggested. Setting stop and take profit to the same amount. No trailing stops, all else equal and see what percentage of trades is wins. If more than 50% say at least 65% then the system has a statistical edge. It has tested 69.23% win on the 5 min.

Is anyone trading this on a live account? or is this just all still in demo testing. Was considering putting it on micro account ..

--- 帖子 #643 ---
well, I would be very careful with that. This EA have large stops and need more demo testing in my opinion. Jiva is all the time making improvements and optimizing settings. I would like to know what Jiva think about this

--- 帖子 #644 ---
It's tempting! But I am not putting it on live account, not even micro, for myself yet. If that says anything. I really want to have the risk management under control. There are still too many loose end details. Details. Details. Details... Mistakes are expensive. So, yes, I am confident of the basic strategy. Still just a little too developmental yet for the big plunge. Maybe when jm gets fired up that'll be the go ahead.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Question: I am assuming that it is permissible in the "rules" to optimize for the longer time period back test for 50-50. Only thing not allowed is trailing stop and profit and stops must be same value. The actual values of the other settings are variables and can be optimized for the longer period backtest whereas the basic strategy remains the same as long as the stops and limits are of equal value and no trails. Am I correct in assuming this?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
The other settings, like channel period and moving averages, may need to be adjusted for the different brokers. This is a pretty sensitive setting using the 5 min. update: I posted a note on the original post. this test was done with v14 which no one has yet. I got a little confused between the volumes. v14 has macd so v11 will not give the same results for the test. So basically no else can test my test. oops..

--- 帖子 #647 ---
According to my understanding there is no significant difference in the calculations of the mt4 macd, it is simply presented differently visually.I n mt4 the osma histogram is treated as it's own separate indicator and is not present on mt4 macd. In mt4 they have represented the ma line as a histogram rather than a line. It is a graphic difference only. The calculations for signal line and macd crossing are not different. That point becomes clear towards the end of the discussion. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=16 Our invaluable technician, mathematician, programmer, grounded in common sense Taiyakixz has researched the macd question: His response is: I checked MACD True, the signal line is different from mt4 standard macd. But we should not select right one, but usuful one. If you like mt4 standard macd, I think that there is no problem. So there we have it, if trying to do this has not already revealed to us that there is no such thing as stable matter, but rather EVERYTHING is in motion, is indeed dynamic and can only be considered as different types of energy, well then we must be dead.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
There has been a confusion, I am afraid I have created it.. I am good at doing that. I don't even have to try. It comes naturally. The testing for the 5 min posted earlier to identify a statistical edge for 50/50 stop loss and limit was done on a version of the Dragon no one else has yet. v14 has the macd filter but we are not ready to post it yet. My mistake. So no one will be able to test my test unless they have v14 and no one has v14 except for Taiyakixz and myself. Dumb, yes, but I am getting used to it.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
maybe i could help somehow? I m newbie in trading but maybe I could use my two vps for optimization settings, if you want

--- 帖子 #650 ---
They aren't really "rules" more common sense I think. If you think about trying to gauge how accurate your entries are then you want your SL and TP to INITIALLY be the same distance from the entry price. Personally I do think it is fine if you want to add a stoplossflat variable that once the market moves towards your TP level you move your stop to the entry price (or entry price + a few pips profit if you prefer)as in this case you are moving the Stop closer to the entry rather than having it further away and if that makes your strategy have a higher percentage of profitable trades then great as it does show that your entry still has an "edge". As I said this has nothing to do with the finished variables we will use when actually trading the EA it is just a process to go through to gauge whether a change in the entry logic (macd, rsi , dss etc etc) is having any material effect on the accuracy of the entries as otherwise when we optimize while moving around the SL and TP levels we are adding other statistically significant parameters into the mix.

I think the MT4 MACD is just missing one line. In it's originally devised form MACD should have a MACD and Signal line and then a histogram showing the spread between the two. Most MACD based trading logic (for example those strategies developed by Boris Schlossberg) will be referring to the slope of this spread between the macd and signal and when this spread crosses 0 being a guage of bullish and bearish behaviour and when we see lower peaks or higher troughs signalling bearing or bullish divergence. As Taiyakixz said it is a matter of preference so when comparing if the MACD is a successful filter for the Dragon I would test both the MT4 MACD and then the histogram of the MACD True to see which is a better filter as technicians long before us have decided that it is this spread that is significant.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Here is a problem, jm, for trying to test for the 50/50 stop and limit probability edge. The Dragon strategy is based primarily on price action in relationship to a hi/lo moving average channel. The channel itself is a sort moving average and the value of the channel will change in relationship the market conditions. The problem is: as market conditions change the value of the hi/lo moving average channel will also change. For instance in some market condition a 55 channel will be the significant value for the channel. In another market condition a 34 hi lo channel will be the significant value. So the strategy does not change but because conditions are fluid and dynamic the value of the channel will need to change within the ea. To try to test for 50/50 over say 5 years will not be realistic proof of a statistical edge or lack thereof for just one setting of a channel value. I am still in favor of regular and frequent optimizations, starting with channel values as opposed to zooming out and trying to see all the activity over a large amount of time as one chunk. Another way to try to see the situation: In another strategy that relies on candlesticks, say go long when there is bullish harami supported by macd. Just hypothetical of course. Bullish haramis and macd's are pretty consistent. There is no setting that needs to change with changing market conditions. So something like that could be tested for 50/50 over 10 years even. But for the Dragon it will be necessary to adapt settings for the moving average hi/lo channel on a regular basis. This is not a shortcoming, indeed it may be a strong point. That it has that ability to adapt to the market. there has been some suggestion made earlier about automated optimizations. I think that may be more relevant for the Dragon considering this fluid aspect than a rigid 50/50 test. Although 50/50 should still have some value if done over a short period of time. Here is a very simplified 50/50 test for 12 months for EURUSD with only a few parameters, basically the channel and moving averages. It tested +66.67%. FXDD This time I used v11.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I understand what you say but I think if you could find a reason why the variables need to change over time (something like their relationship to atr for example) then you could build this logic into the ea so they are dynamically reacting to market conditions. If you see the only reason for them to change is because the optimization says so we are back to curve fitting on historical data that may be completely different in the coming week/month.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
The monitoring of multi time frame moving averages should be sufficient to identify these changes. If you will notice, a trade is only considered when the moving averages on mult time frames are in alignment. That alignment is significant. The value of the channel being correlated with the intensity of the trend. I believe it is acceptable to optimize for the these values and it is not simply curve fitting. If optimization for these parameters is done regularly and frequently the ea will be making decisions following the natural flow of the market. This strategy allows the ea to only enter trades in the direction of the trend in strongly trending markets. Which also means using a large stop loss is not as risky as it may seem at first glance since the trade is being entered in the direction of an established trend.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
EURUSD could be setting up short... would need to pull back a bit more with a close above channel low for ea to take a trade.

You are using the set file from 10/18 It is serving you well. EA caught the pullback in GU which is what it is meant to do. The gu set file has been dated, I am using set with updated file 10/28. nothing, zero, zip, zilch, FXDD... What happened to NZDUSD, hit first target then 2nd position stopped out?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
yes, yes. I see. It is interesting that you are using the files from 10/17 and 10/18. I was thinking that to update every week would keep the ea in tune with current market direction. But I see the week old set files have taken so many nice trades, while the ones I am using which were updated for 10/28 and 10/29 have not taken any trades at all. This is one of the reasons I so appreciate you following the thread and taking the time to help test the ea. We can compare how things are working from different angles of vision, different brokers , different set files, etc.. Now I have to consider what this might mean, if anything. Maybe my process of updating needs some revision. Every 2 weeks, or choosing different types of settings, Whatever. Let's see what happens. Maybe just keep the settings you have and don't download the updated ones. .. which I have been posting on the 1st page regularly. Exciting isn't it. Can it keep winning? I think it can. It is only trading pullbacks in strong established trends. At first I wanted to catch the initial breakouts and we were using pending orders but that is too risky. Much better to wait for a pullback and ride the middle of a move rather than try to catch the very beginning. Maybe it's going to get confused sometime, like at the point of reversal, but I don't think it will be very often. I think by adding macd cross on a lower time frame, maybe 15 min we can even prevent that. Will need to run some tests this weekend. We will get there, I am convinced. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/thumbsup.gif Have a good weekend. Thank you again for your help. Pracując razem nam się uda.

I thought I posted but it is not showing up, maybe this is a repeat post, any way, hi. File is too big to upload? or you have uploaded too many files? Forex factory says exceeded quota? Or some other program? not understanding. I have received message before that file is too big. if file is too big can convert it to another format? By using "paint" and make it bitmap? But sometimes that decreases the quality. I have not run into that message before so I am not sure what it is. Maybe if you can go back and delete some of the rough drafts you posted as we were in development if the edit function is still available. It would be nice to have a record of the history of the development of the logo but if that is what forex factory means by exceeding quota of uploads, posted graphics really eats into bytes, then maybe that would free up for uploading the final graphic. Before you do any deleting though lets see if we can't figure out exactly what the problem is. If need be we can email TWEE one of the forex factory administrators and ask what we should. Can you explain little more detail what you are doing to upload and how the message is coming? Maybe Taiyakixz will know. What I do for storage is email the file to myself and then store it on hotmail.com as a saved email. If it is too big to attach I zip it. But that is for storage. We miss you. We are almost done with the logo. What do you think? Almost final... It is beautiful we want to post on the first page for introduction. Just a couple of little things and ready. You are studying art and design? If you have time you can set up the ea and help us monitor the trades.

Hi there Jiva34 , I am actually studying Electronics engineering, Graphic desgin is my hobby and I have also made some small trademarks and 2 or 3 complete business images (This is the way we call in my country to give an image to a business, not sure is a valid translation lol), I got an idea by reading your post, I will upload to my gmail-docs account new pictures and make them publicly avilable, that way I wont have the need of uploading in my profile inside this forum, only linking to the URL that gmail gives . Thanks for your kind words I really feel good about beeing contributive to your Thread, I will start modifications of the logo now . And about testing this EA of course I will, I haven't have much time latelly schoolś semester is almost over and things go crazy lol, but could you give me some pairs to be tested please? , that way I could give a solid feedback . EDIT : New logo (I have a doubt about the gray curved backgroud part, as you know english is not my first lenguage lol, did I understand your last post changes ? ) I couldn't attach file via URL , the attachments window said invalid file, it should be because in URL gmail gives doesn't have file's extension, example : .png , bmp etc. this one is .png, yes I have exceeded my profile's quota in the forum, maybe we could ask the administrator to extend storage size, or I could delete some previous files, dont worry I would save historical logos, for future uses, When Admin will give me more storage I can re-upload them, I will wait untill we have a response from admin so we know what we can do about this. __________ Sequoia

Curious.. are using vps? just curious.. At first I thought yes this is great, runs 24/7no problem. I was using vps but to tell you the truth it would go down fairly often and when it did it would wipe clean all my settings. They would do regular updating for their severs every Saturday and it would also wipe clean all my settings. Bizarre.. How can anyone use something like this? After reloading everything a few times I said forget it... I can just run a second computer from my trading desk and be much better off.

Please always refer to the first page for the most recent updated .set files. EURAUD 1h optimized FXDD 10/30/10 Thanks to jm2110, and his in depth critiques, we are now including a "50/50 statistical edge" test for every new update. This is a test where all the settings for channel, moving averages, dss, etc remain the same. The settings for stop loss and take profit will be set equal to each other. If there is a statistical edge to the strategy it will show wins more than 50% of the time, preferably at least 65%. So that adjusting with stops and trailing stops is truly optimizing and not merely curve fitting. The 2nd graph is the 50-50. It tested at 57.14% win rate. I am seeing how to use this very valuable tool. It may be that the 50-50 is the first optimization to run along with the channel. The Dragon's bare bones. Then we dress him up later... Traders, please keep your insights, comments, and ideas coming. Thank you, jm. Like I said, you always learn the most from your toughest customers....

--- 帖子 #673 ---
euraus zip It looks like your optimization has a stop loss of 250. Isn't that a little high, and with a stop that high if you go with the trend i will win most of the time. Just when you lose it is big.

We are not using real money yet. Everything is under testing. Those parameters were the best. 1st take profit is 99pips!! The plan as of today, , and it can, and most likely will, change as we try to get this right, is to optimize the settings every week. The rational is that because the ea is only supposed to take a trade in a pullback in a well established trend if the stop is big it will be fine. Yes there is always the possibility of hitting it. We are under testing so it is not the end of the world if this does not work. We are in experimental stage. So we do not try to guess but we want to see the proof. It is an experiment. Then we will analyze the results. But yes 250 is a whopper. No one should be using real money at this point....

We want to thank, you, for your pointing out the big stop losses. After considering the situation a little more I tried something new. We are now testing v14 which has a macd filter, not just an ordinary macd filter but a macd filter that can be set for multi time frames. Taiyakixz is not only a genius but is psychic as well. I asked for macd but he has given super macd. With use of the macd filter on a lower time frame and by running a 50/50 statistical edge test initially it appears we will able to reduce the stop loss to as little as 20 pips with a very significant win rate and big total profit. This now makes the big fear of buying a top or selling a bottom insignificant. A solution I had not considered previously. Thanks, kauaibobby, for pointing the big stop loss out. I might have otherwise just ignored this problem and insisted the "emperor does have clothes". This is how it works. Comments, insights, different angles of vision. We will get there. v14 is not ready for posting. There is an issue with some extra moving averages that were added, which after considering the situation do not really need to be there and are not working properly. But we have more than enough to do to continue testing v11. There is still plenty to learn from v11.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Logo is ready as far as I can see. The background is very good. Now to figure out how to get it up on the 1st page after we see if Taiyakixz is happy with it. Wait a minute, oh. oh. I'm sorry, I see 2 things. Please forgive me, I don't want to seem like I am picking nits, but I probably am. You know the story about the sculptor who chiseled a fabulous figurine? He worked at it for a long time and very meticulously. It was truly gorgeous. He thought he had finished, but then he noticed a tiny protruding speck on the cheek. He very gently tapped at it and the whole sculpture shattered. So. I see 3 things. 1.The white in the green dragon's tail. Could it be toned down with a light green tint rather than stark white? 2. And I wish the little dragons near the title could have eyes. A little black speck would do or red you decide.. 3. We do not know how many volumes there will be. This is v11 now, but already v14 is in testing just not posted yet. Maybe no volume number? When the market opens we will most likely receive some sort of response from TWEE, the administrator. I don't understand how you could have exceeded a maximum. I have been posting since the beginning of 09. charts, graphics, you name it. And they are all still stored on ff!!

Logo Hi there , Thanks Jiva34 I hope We have finished first logo, I will be making new versions when V14 arrives(if needed) that's why I wrote the EA's current version in previous logos, Like in the "THV system" for example, they have a logo for each version (almost the same only changing the numbers lol) but I deleted it as you told me friend ,the small dragons already had eyes but they were orange-red colors, and with the small picture size they seemed to banish, now they are black so we can now see them lol . If you have any changes in mind please don't hesitate to ask , it's an honor to be helpfull . ___________ Sequoia

Boy have I got some good news!! v14.1 is so hot. moving averages 6,7,8 and are up and running, just in case we want to use them. macd on a lower time frame stops bad entries, without blocking good entries. I am working on set files now. Since v11 is up and running lets stay with it until we have enough set files to make a clean switch. maybe before Tues Fed v14.1 takes the Dragon to a whole new level of precision...

This is too good not to start sharing. Will leave v11 posted. But am adding v14 and .set files as they are finished. will post the template along with each set file in the zip. Just setting up the template is an all-day event...Make it easier for traders to set up. No need for others to the reinvent the wheel. I already have the templates, so will just zip them along... I hope this doesn't get too zooey... eventually we will phase out v11 but not until v14 is fully set up. But I want to have at least some v14 set up for Fed Tues..

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Please always check the title page for the latest updated files. tests run on FXDD 12 months prior v14.1 will eventually be posted as the current ea, for now it is posted here along a few set files. What is exciting about this is the reduction in stop loss risk. EURUSD has 21 pip stop loss, that's fantastic, I think we can increase it a bit and still be very, very safe.... EURCHF has 50 pips stop EURGBP has 21 pips stop This means the weak point of the ea is no longer a huge threat. It is weak in that it can on rare occasions buy a top or sell a bottom. If it does do that it is not now a devastation, as with a 200 pip stop loss!! It is survivable. It is also less likely to do that with the macd filter on the lower time frame. So the curve is not as "pretty" but it is a lot safer!!!! We will continue to refine the functioning until we are certain enough to risk real capital. We are not there yet. No one should be using real money yet... 50/50 edge tests EURCHF 100% win rate EURUSD 76.92% win rate EURGBP 87.50% win rate

No no thank you. By your simple and sincere inquiry about the 250 pip stop loss you brought me back to reality. I can get way out there, in case you hadn't noticed.. The templates for v14.1 will be each unique for the particular pair's settings. We didn't do that for v11. just didn't think to to do it. So if you are loading v14.1 the templates for v14.1 will go in the template folder. In mt4 there are 2 template folders. These files go in the template folder that is in the same menu as experts ( not the template folder that appears after you click experts)...

Jiva34 and Taiyakixz you are the best!!! One more time thx for sharing with us, Dragon rocks, you rocks!!! I m using now v11 and v14 together. V11 took the trade at collective, jade, fxopen and fxdd http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/1633/fxdd.jpg

--- 帖子 #697 ---
EURGBP on the v11 set opened short... (v14.1 sets don't have the big stop losses like v11. v14 stop loss for EURGBP is 20 pips...) This is why we want to phase into v14.1. v11 can and does buy a top and sell a bottom. With a huge stop loss like in this trade it can devastate an account. Inso and I have v14.1 set up for EURGBP with a 20 pip stop loss but v14.1 did not take this trade.

I just wanted to thank you guys for this wonderful EA. I have been trading version 11 with real money on FXDD, but to be safe just .10 cent pips, but it has won every trade over the last few weeks, except 1 that I closed in drawdown because it didn't look good, but of course it came back had I left it alone, and now with your new "safer" version maybe I can increase the size a bit. I would rather trade very small live than use a demo account and I beieve in your EA. I have bought many EA's that just don't work at all. I have been trading all pairs except pairs that have the CAD in them since on those I remember reading that further back tests than 1 year were not so good. So I just wanted to say a big thank you to Jiva and Taiyakixz and all the others who have contributed.

Nice!! Happy to hear you have some success. Yes, if a trader can afford it, micro gives a more realistic experience. after all demo there is nothing really at stake. I think the entries are good. Now we are refining with several new tools. The 50/50 statistical edge test is superb to tell right away if the entries are any good or not, and then we can optimize those entries. Last thing to optimize is take profit. With smaller stop loss we will be able tolerate the inevitable bad trade relatively painlessly. But we are not done!! I think we may never be really done. We are not giving the green light go ahead for trading real money just yet. But if you feel confident to do so, more power to you as they used to say... We have been asked if we would go commercial with this. But my feeling is this ea is a product of the free sharing of ideas and experience in the forum. It should remain free. It's not like there aren't enough pips for everyone in the forex market.

i got optimizer to work properly i think. i tested eurchf 1-1-10 to 1-1-10 net profit 22,000 relative drawdown 7 % only 18 trades. What about overoptimizing ( curve fitting ) where it works good on back test but not on forward. The optimization takes a long time even just changing one thing using every tick, can you use control point or open price to get a rough idea. Trade 10 stayed open for 3 months with a 9,300 profit, not bad, a long time to stay opened but it kept modifying to keep the profit, so looks good. All trades were sell i noticed. I had a few 2 week gaps in history but 90% modeling. Not sure on the test report about mismatched error i get 0, so that is good. But after that there is the green bar and on different tests sometimes there is more green, sometimes less, not sure if that is important. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
The more we practice using the optimizer the more we will see how to use it effectively. Good to see you making the effort. Time consuming, cpu consuming, you name it, optimizing is a long slog for sure. Sometimes I set the step to 5 or more and use control point and that speeds things up. Then go back and set step to 1 near where the optimal settings were found and use every tick to finalize it. It's a matter of practice to get to know how to use it. Practice, practice, practice... http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...MGi06CewFiztU=

--- 帖子 #706 ---
&gt;&gt;&gt;What about overoptimizing ( curve fitting ) where it works good on back test but not on forward.&lt;&lt;&lt; We are running a 50/50 statistical edge test the very first thing to determine if the entries are any good at all. The 1st profit, 2nd profit and stop are all set to the same amount. No trailing stops. The other settings are left as they are from the downloaded set file for the pair. Run the optimizer. If the win rate is more than 50%, preferably 65% or better we know we have a statistical edge. We will win more times than lose. That we are not simply fitting a curve. Jm2110 in his critical analysis last week brought this point out. We are seeing how to use this 50/50 to best advantage. Then when we optimize for take profit etc, we have reassurance that the basis from where we are performing optimization is sound. So if the profit is set larger than the stop loss, and the win rate is more than 50%, we know we will come out ahead even if there a few losses along the way. So we try to do the 50/50 test with as small a stop loss as possible. So we can optimize the take profit higher starting from a small stop loss. Make sense? :nerd:

Jiva thank you You explained what the 50/50 is, I wasn’t sure what you meant by that. It is starting to make sense all the hard work you are doing, I am slowly figuring it out. I know brokers vary a lot, but I was wondering what we should experiment with our broker. I know the offset is different for brokers. What about changing other setting what should we try first. How much difference between FXDD and Alpari do you find you need to change settings. I hope I am not asking to much of you to help me figure this stuff out, but I want to help and make money also with your great ea.

I tryed to post in the thread some hours ago, and somehow it was not aprooved again . Do you know at what numbers of posts my posts are not going to be manually checked by moderator? Hello Guys I have no trades placed by EA ,since I first activated V14, (like 9 hours ago) Is this normal guys? it still makes few trades ? I will update when new trades are placed Thanks guys __________- Sequoia

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Sheesh... Why so many problems for you to post? shouldn't be. I don't think it is moderator. Maybe some technical problem with computer... You can contact the administrators, to see if the problem is on ff end, they're okay people. They do a darn good job of keeping forex factory in line... and focused with very little ads cluttering up things. Bottom of any web page, click contact ff.. It's hard enough trying to get trades right without all the other technical stuff making it even more difficult. Let's get this straightened out.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
9 hours and no trades is not unusual at all. Especially while the market has no clearly defined direction which is often the case for days before significant data is going to be released. Sometimes just before the data there are big moves in anticipation and then after the release a strong trend forms in many of the pairs. That is why we want to be set up as much as possible before Tuesdays US election results and Weds fed announcements. I have noticed that v11 has taken so many trades last few days while v14.1 has not taken any at all. It may be because the settings for v14.1 are safer with smaller stop losses they will not be opened until there is a really strong move in the direction of the trend. So Tues and Weds will be perfect test time for v14.1. It will be interesting to see how v11 and v14.1 both perform. v11 just opened short EURUSD during Asian session. Update several hours later: here's what happened. this is using v11 and shows why we want to develop v14.1 with the small stop losses. The Dragon sold a bottom............on the 1h the Dragon was also set up with a 15min setting which opened long a few minutes later. The long position acted as a hedge to lessen the losses. Total loss -126 pips Without the hedge loss would have been the full -220. It is an idea that has been planted. A setting with a large stop loss could be accompanied by a setting on lower time frame. Like this, the 1hr accompanied by a hedge setting on the 15 min. Interesting.

Yes , and this Forum is by far the best in all the web about Forex. Maybe I just have to wait until I have the right number of posts to be automatically authorized, I really don't want to boder anyone, they should be very bussy , and just to track the problem is going to take too much time for them. (I know is not my system's problem, because I have seen my post online ,with the little red box in the bottom part saying my post first should be manually authorized...) A quick qestion, are you still thinking about moving the system to lower TFs, or do you think this can be best in H1 as it is now? Thanks Jiva for your time and kindness, green pips for you and everyone in the thread. EDIT : AWSOME !!! this post was authomatically uploaded, no more problems ______________- Sequoia

The Higher Powers have seen fit!! One thing at a time. Let's get the 1hr series up and running first before going on to anything else. The Dragon is extremely versatile and I have no doubt there are other ways to set the options but for now we are concentrating, let's stay focused. The grass is very green on this side of the fence... the 1 hour has a lot going for it.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Okay here's what happened. I have 3 different settings for EURUSD set up on the demo. The original v11 1h setting with the 110 stop loss entered short. Then the v11 15 min setting entered long. so now the account is hedged. This, simply by accident, not planned, has given an interesting idea how to possibly manage a trade with a large stop loss. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi Jiva, I agree v14 looks very promising BUT unfortunately when I run the same set file from Jan09 you can once again easily visually spot the period where you started your optimization from. This is using your .set file with a corrected GMT offset for Dukascopy 99% accurate tick data. As you can see at about trade 74 the P&amp;L starts its upward march but before that it isn't great at all so I still am very concerned that with so many variables to optimize for we can effectively curve fit your model to any data set and make it look fantastic. As you know from my past comments I am a little dubious on rolling optimizations as I see them as just rolling curve fitting but I am happy to agree to disagree on that. I still fancy trying to optimize this EA over much longer data sets and seeing what the "average" performance is like. Given the speed at which you are pumping out these .set files you have obviously managed to work out a series of variables you optimize in steps rather than all at once as otherwise the time taken to do each optimization would take weeks. Therefore could you please explain what process you are going through i.e. which variables you target first and with what steps and then 2nd 3rd etc. This would help me greatly when doing much longer runs over larger data sets after which I can return with my findings. Thanks in advance. Jono

Glad to see you back. Thought maybe you had abandoned ship. There seems to be less and less hours in a day lately. Will get back to you asap with the sequence I am currently using and our ongoing discussion of optimizing.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
&gt;&gt;&gt;I know the offset is different for brokers. What about changing other setting what should we try first.&lt;&lt;&lt; jm2110 has also requested I post the sequence I am currently using forvoptimizing. I will post that shortly. &gt;&gt;&gt;How much difference between FXDD and Alpari do you find you need to change settings.&lt;&lt;&lt; A lot. I start with the FXDD set file and see if it can work at all. Most of the time it doesn't work very well on Alpari. Usually it seems it is the channel that needs to be set differently. But I will post the sequence.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As you know from my past comments I am a little dubious on rolling optimizations as I see them as just rolling curve fitting but I am happy to agree to disagree on that. I still fancy trying to optimize this EA over much longer data sets and seeing what the "average" performance is like. &lt;&lt;&lt; Yes, it would be wonderful to be able to optimize over a longer period of time. However, by the nature of the strategy itself it is not possible to do that . As I posted earlier in response to this issue, because the main indicator is a moving average channel the value of that channel will change as the market changes. Just as in trying to find the moving average most appropriate for finding pullbacks changes for different trend moves. Sometime a 55 sma will catch the pullbacks, sometimes it is a 34sma. It will vary for a particular trend. So that is why rolling optimizations is really the only realistic and practical method for the Dragon. If the strategy were based on an an event that was always the same, with no variable involved, then optimization over long periods of time would work nicely. Like traders who use candlesticks and bollinger bands, for instance. Hypothetically, when a bullish harami occurs and the candle closes inside the bollinger band, etc. That is always a case with no variable, it's a fixed occurrence. But the channel is moving with the market and does change its value. Maybe you do not like it, but do you see the issue? How a variable is part of the main strategy. The changing moving average channel. I really see no practical way to get around this. The Dragon is confirming a strong trend with use of the multi time frame moving averages so it will not enter a trade without that confirmation, it nicely avoids consolidations that way. So I see no problem in updating on a regular basis. Except, from a personal perspective, it would be nice not to have to do that.

Yes, other traders have also been asking for the sequence I am currently using. I would like to say this is cut in stone, although there is a basic system to it, I allow for some flexibility. No need to reinvent the wheel I start with settings that were already calculated for v11. Open the setting in v14.1. 1. First thing I do is remove the trailing stops, and then I set the 1st profit, 2nd profit and stop to the same value. I start with the smallest stop value possible. Usually I will try 20 for all three. I run it on control point as a rough draft technique. If 20 returned a profit and the win rate was high, say over 65%. That's the value I use for the rest of the optimizations. I leave the 1st profit, the 2nd profit and the stop all set to 20 with no trailing stops. If it was not acceptable I set all three to maybe 30. If that doesn't work 40. I don't want go over 50. If none of that worked then the channel needs to be optimized. set everything back to 20. run control point for the channel. Start 5, step 5, end 65. So like that. first thing is get the channel right and 50/50 to show high win rate. Other wise forget that pair. But they can all be done. I have not had to skip any pair yet. Once the 50/50 is acceptable, and the channel is optimized. Next is 2. dss (2 settings together) 3. macd (3 settings together) you can experiment with macd if you want, but I have found it is most useful set to the 1min chart using the macd cross 4 t3 (sometimes t3 is not good to use, sometimes it is). 5. then the moving averages start with higher and work down to lower 6 then back to profit 1 7. trail for profit one = 0 does not need to be set to a different value. 8. profit 2 9. trailing stop profit 2 10. If the results are good, leave the stop as it is. We want that to be as small as possible. If we can decrease a few losses by increasing the stop a little bit then we can optimize. But we want the take profit 1 to be more than the stop loss by as much as possible. The initial run is control point. After each function has been optimized run the new setting on each tick to see the graph. Sometimes choosing the biggest profit is not the best choice. It may have introduced some losses too. So before going on to the next function make sure what has been optimized so far is acceptable. I think that just about covers it.

I can understand how different sma settings better fit the market conditions. However I would like to be concentrating on WHY that is the case. Is it because the market gets more volatile i.e. ATR increases, etc. If we can find some rough link then we can program that into the EA allowing it to automatically predict that the sma should now be looking at a longer or shorter window given how the market is evolving. What continues to concern me is that if we can understand no link to why this variable moves around then we are just once again curve fitting and just because it happens to fit doesn't mean the very next trade is any more likely to follow this same pattern. The fact in my previous post that you can so clearly see the point on the p&amp;l chart that the optimization took place shows that there clearly was no relationship to this set file in the month leading up to the period you optimized for.....this is worrying. Even more worrying is when you said that you find your .set files have different SMA settings depending on which broker is used.... I am not disputing at all that this is the case but if you think about it it really is madness. The EUR is EUR is EUR no matter where it is traded. I am yet to see anyone pitch a strategy where we can successfully arbitrage one mt4 broker against another. We know that if we have multiple mt4 platforms running their prices are within a fraction of a basis point of each other....funnily enough the fx market is very efficient. However as you have discovered when optimizing you are getting wildly different variables depending on which brokers data you are using. In my opinion this has NOTHING to do with how the market is going to function in a live forward test it just shows that the brokers historical databases have holes in them and your modelling quality is not high enough...sure 90% sounds great but when you finally forward test you are getting 100% quality...that 10% can make massive differences. Sure bid/offer can make a difference in scalping strategies but in trades where we are trying to take 20-100 pips out of each trade the difference between 1 or 2 pips in bid offer is insignificant and DEFINATELY shouldn't be effecting the SMA periods we are using. At this time the closest you can get to true 100% back testing is by following Birts instructions on achieving 99% through Dukascopy http://eareview.net/tick-data .....it takes a long time to prepare but once you have the data you can be fairly sure that there are no assumptions being made in your testing. Saying we have a .set file for Alpari doesn't mean it is accurate to Alpari's live feed. All it says is that this is the .set file that gives us the prettiest picture using Alpari's old data which we know we're are only getting 90% modelling quality on. I always choose to optimise and backtest using the highest quality data I can find - Dukascopy 99% and then take the resulting .set file and run it over Alpari etc...I know it will never look identical but I just double check that it isn't a disaster as I know with 90% quality it is never going to be "right". If you really stop to think about the fact you are finding you need different sma's to show optimal results on different brokers in the same currencies (assuming the GMT offset has been adjusted) then I think it is time to upgrade to 99% quality because it makes no sense that something as fundamental as the sma would change ...yes you might find the take profit in one broker in 28 pips and another 26 because on a piece of data the price spiked 2 pips higher quickly but 99.9% of the time those broker feeds are going to be virtually identical and definitely not different enough to justify taking different sma snapshots.

jm2110 does it again. Pushes me to the brink..... How did you know I have been avoiding Duskacopy? I took a glance at some discussion of setting it up and said, yikes. Well it looks like it's time, to take a second look as Duskacopy!!! &gt;&gt;&gt; What continues to concern me is that if we can understand no link to why this variable moves around then we are just once again curve fitting and just because it happens to fit doesn't mean the very next trade is any more likely to follow this same pattern. The fact in my previous post that you can so clearly see the point on the p&amp;l chart that the optimization took place shows that there clearly was no relationship to this set file in the month leading up to the period you optimized for.....this is worrying.&lt;&lt;&lt; My reasoning at the present time is that it is not necessary to find out wh y a change is occurring. To use another indicator, ATR or whatever, The reason being is that the ea is set up to take trades only in the middle of well established trends. The entries are on pullbacks. It will not be able to catch the beginning of a trend, because of the use of mult time frame moving averages, the slower ones do not turn quickly enough to catch an initial breakout, but when there is a pullback an entry will be identified. Macd on the 1min time frame helps identify the entry. So if a market turns it will take a little while before the ea will find entries. By the time the moving averages are lined up, the channel value will be identified also. So it is only the middle of the trend that is traded. Using the smallest stop possible reduces any losses that might occur should the ea buy a top or sell a bottom which it can do, since the moving averages are still aligned just before a reversal. But a small stop loss is livable. Hence v14.1 and the ability to set up small stop losses. The ea does well to stay out of consolidations again due to the required moving average line up. So I do not think you see how the ea itself actually functions otherwise you would not be arguing along the line of reasoning of trying to optimize over long periods of time. I think you miss the point. What you see as a weak point is actually the ea's strength. So by testing over long periods of time your results are misleading. You are using the wrong line of reasoning to set up your tests. At least this what I am understanding from your arguments. Please try to understand the strategy behind the expert adviser. I think you may be caught up in rules for the sake of rules and missing the point. Thank you for throwing Duksacopy at me. I will be looking into it seriously. Thank you for putting your valuable time into the thread.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hi Jiva, I understand the logic of the system and it is because of this that I am concerned. Yes by waiting for the series of sma's to all line up you will never be getting the start of a trend, always the mid part as you say. But given you are trying to capture the mid part of the trend why do you always need to change the size of the sma window you're are looking at? The reason no doubt will be because as volatility decreases your optimization will show you need to get into the trend earlier so you can still capture you first ~ 20 pip profit so the sma window will be smaller to allow this. Likewise as volatility increases and therefore the swings are larger you can afford (and is safer) to wait a bit longer for trend confirmation so the sma window will widen. As we have seen from my backtest not only do some previously highly profitable .set files (and thus sma windows) cause the EA not to be as profitable they can actually cause it to regularly lose money so this is extremely important. The problem with rolling optimization is “what are you going to optimize?”....the last year every week? Well then the current market situation (the current week) is only going to have 1/52 effect on your optimization so if the market has suddenly changed it is going to take months until your .set file is accurately reflecting the new market behaviour. Or do we optimize just the last months data every week...problem then is there will only be 2 or 3 trades and then we are definitely curve fitting. Hence I find the preferable approach is to either optimize over a longer period to find an "average" sma window that doesn't hit home runs but also doesn't lose money in most situations...OR try to link the sma window size to market volatility so we are immediately modifying the logic within the EA rather than lagging up to months behind. Hope that kind of explains what I am saying. If you have any questions re Dukascopy capture and conversion etc feel free to pm me. Jono

Likewise as volatility increases and therefore the swings are larger you can afford (and is safer) to wait a bit longer for trend confirmation so the sma window will widen.&lt;&lt;&lt; I believe the volatility issue is dealt with sufficiently by the hi/lo channel. Once the channel extremes are breached by a close outside of either the hi or lo in relation to the respective trend direction it is a signal that the trend is resuming. Long a breach above channel hi, low a breach below. That is:a breach being- the candle closes inside then a candle closes outside. For seeing into the future what the channel setting will be I do not think is practical. If traders could see into the future we would all be zillionaires by now. I do not see how ATR would be a reliable indicator for this. I have not worked with ATR per se, although I have looked at it a bit. It does not impress me enough to incorporate it into the coding...

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Thanks to jm2110 for his persistence.. There is much very good insight and lots to be learned from experienced traders like jm.. I am changing the optimizing approach a bit. One thing I have decided is that slower moving average hi/lo channels are preferable to faster ones for this strategy. I have been able to optimize the 50/50 test back to 3 years so far and will see how far back we can go using the slower channels with fairly consistent results, at least on EURUSD in v14.1. I hope traders see why we urge not to use real money yet...The Dragon is under development.... The graph is a rough draft. 15 min setting 36 months previous 20 pips stop 20 pips limit, 70 ema channel. Pretty much bare bones 50/50 test.

Hi Jiva, today early morning one sell trade occured, which was taken by version11 (version11.jpg) -&gt; both positions on EURUSD hit SLs (2x110 pips). Here is screen shot from version14.1 chart (currently updated) -&gt; I browsed for the critic time (version14.1_M1.jpg). Now I'm wondering, if it (v14.1) would take that trade or not. In what position should be MACD indi, to confirm trading conditions for that trade? Can you explain me this new setting condition (MACD crossing), please? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi, Yes this is exactly why v14.1 has been created. to be able to use as small as possible stop losses....... No v14.1 would not have taken the trade. I had all three EURUSD settings up. v11 1 hr, v11 15 min and v14.1 see this post for what happened. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=715 In v14.1 macd is set for a confirmation of a crossing on the 1min. It seems to be very effective for preventing bad entries. We have been a little preoccupied experimenting with some of the ideas jm2110 has been presenting. Seeing how to maximize the optimizing:nerd:

--- 帖子 #731 ---
The chart shows what the trades from v14.1 look like. v14.1 is very good catching the middle of a trend. there were 2 losses (x 2 positions) on the chart, stopped out for 20 pips per position. EURUSD backtest 12 months FXDD 1h.. Obviously we do not know what the future will be and fitting settings to a back test is not going to tell us what the future will be. My thinking is to do regularly 50/50 tests, and optimizing to keep up with market changes. There is argument against this, that it will not be effective. Let us test going forward a bit and see. We want to get this right before committing any hard earned money... I think the ea is sound enough to be able to avoid consolidations and able to capture middle of the trend trades as long as we keep up with the regular optimization of the settings. So let us make an experiment and see. v14.1 gives us what we need: very small stop losses and laser focused entries with macd on the 1min. I will be putting more time into getting the settings for the other pairs ready for testing on v14.1

--- 帖子 #732 ---
We will need to get used to getting some stopped out trades with v14.1. But the stops will be small and the overall strategy is a lot safer than v11. It is unrealistic to think there will not be bad trades and losses with any strategy or system. The idea is to keep the losses small and keep the gains big. We will be working on getting .set files for more pairs fro v14.1 over the next few days. Traders who would like to do some of the set files are welcome. Rough guidelines are posted here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=725 Questions, comments, discussion always welcome.....

http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...c29aJ3F6NuCsg= We might be having some technical difficulties. The macd setting doesn't seem to be working properly. macd is set to check for a cross on the 1m but comments display macd cross as up on 1m but we can see from the indicator window macd cross is clearly down? Lots to learn trying to get this right. v14.1 may have been released too early. sorry for the inconvenience they may have caused traders. We wanted to be set up with v14.1 for the action after Fed Weds. but it looks like we will have to make do with v11 and the big stop losses until we can be sure macd is working properly in v14.1.That may be part of the reason why it has not taken any trades at all since it's release. Ah well, at least we have v11 for Weds. Big stop losses and all... We will have to see what Taiyakixz can do to make sure things are really sound and fully technically up and running before we try to release it again. This happens a lot. Little bugs here and there that need to be ironed out. v11 has all the bugs taken care of but it took some doing to get there. So no surprise if there a few little buggy critters lurking in v14.1. Again sorry for the inconvenience. A lesson we have learned. To be very,very certain the the technical aspect is sound before trying to make the upgrade available.

Thanks for your hard work Jiva, Luckily it seems like a minor bug, let's hope can be easily solved, I will close temporally my V14 charts, and make some tests in V11 , a good prevention to avoid using the system live yet , but I am sure in future this will ROCK very hard. __________- Sequoia

v11 Please always refer to the first page for the most recent updated .set files. EURAUD 1h optimized FXDD 10/30/10 Thanks to jm2110, and his in depth critiques, we are now including a "50/50 statistical edge" test for every new update. This is a test where all the settings for channel, moving averages, dss, etc remain the same. The settings for stop loss and take profit will be set equal to each other. If there is a statistical edge to the strategy it will show wins more than 50% of the time, preferably at least 65%. So that adjusting with stops and trailing stops is truly optimizing and not merely curve fitting. The 2nd graph is the 50-50. It tested at 57.14% win rate. I am seeing how to use this very valuable tool. It may be that the 50-50 is the first optimization to run along with the channel. The Dragon's bare bones. Then we dress him up later... http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif Traders, please keep your insights, comments, and ideas coming. Thank you, jm.

v11 Please always check the title page for the most recent updated .set files. So many little details. Easy to make a mistake. But sometimes the mistakes turn out to be something that opens up a whole new area to be researched. In the NZDUSD settings I noticed that somehow or other, I had one of the moving averages set for a shift 4. I had no intention to do that. It was a slipup. But it tested very nicely. Without that shift 4 not so good. so I went back and optimized NZD for shifts in moving averages. Surprising results. I guess this all comes under the heading of "curve fitting". So we shall see how it goes. Not to unnecessarily confuse things http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s.../yim/silly.gif this is the NZDUSD set optimized for moving averages with shift.

Will be seeing how to test rolling optimizations. Plan is to optimize for a 12 month period, say Jan 09 to Jan 10. Use those settings for a back test of the month of Feb 10. Then optimize for Feb 09 to Feb 10 use those settings to back test for the month of March 10 and so on, to see how rolling updates affect results going forward, a procedure called "walking forward". Does this prevent losses? Does this identify the trading channel as it moves with the market? etc. :nerd: No stone unturned.. (Where's jm2110? I think he will have something to say). But we are scientist, we want to test this. I think it is a valid approach. More so than trying to zoom out to cover data for several years with one channel setting. So let us see. Update:: v14.2.... After running some preliminary walk forward tests,,, results are very, very good. Nicely profitable. It may be that it is not even to best advantage to optimize for 12 months. 6 months may be even better... So let us see.

Re: Basic optimizing procedure Learning as we go. At first I was optimizing everything!!! But now I see if there are some setting I can keep constant that is a good advantage. At least for now I see like that, that could change. So instead of optimizing macd and dss, I am leaving them constant at the default settings. optimizing goes a lot faster that way also. 50/50 statistical edge test is first. No need to reinvent the wheel if we have a set file from a previous test we can start with those settings. 1. First thing I do is remove the trailing stops. Set the 1st profit, 2nd profit and stop to the same value. If we do not have a set file to work from: pick a channel period, say 55 or 34. Set take profit1, profit2 and stop to the same value. 20 or 30 pips. No trailing stops. Run a test using control point (faster than every tick and this is all rough draft work at this point) With dss and macd at default. Settings for moving averages can all be set to 0 to start or they can all be set to 10 or whatever. We can optimize all of that later. We simply want to find the channel at this point. We are looking for a success rate over 50%, 65% or more is very good. The higher the success rate the better. But we also want as many trades a s possible too. When we have at least some success rate, we then optimize for the channel. We want to find where the most trades are and also to find the highest success rate. Once the 50/50 test is acceptable, and the channel is optimized. Next is 1. The moving averages start with higher and work down to lower 2. Profit 1 3. Trail for profit one = 0 does not need to be set to a different value. 4. Profit 2 5. Trailing stop profit 2 The initial run is control point. After each function has been optimized run the new setting to see the graph. Sometimes choosing the biggest profit is not the best choice. It may have introduced some losses too. So before going on to the next function make sure what has been optimized so far is acceptable. Run a final test of the new settings on each tick. I think that just about covers it. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/peace.gif Any volunteers to help find the set files for v14.2? The link to Beta testing is on the title page.

Hi there , I sign up as beta-tester I made my first one Pair eur/usd , with the set file uploaded by JIva34 in the post I am quoting. TF H1 1 Year here is the graph and the report, in the report is amazing to see the max drawdown 2.85% (I see a little difference with results on this quoted post, maybe different time lapse, mine were done in a 1 Year basis) EDIT : I noticed my backtest was made with 10,000.00 USD now I made it with 1,000.00 and max drawdown was 14.54% , still very acceptable in my humble opinion, profit is obviously the same as I didnt change anything else in this test. _________- Sequoia

Very nice looking short entry EURAUD. Smart, very smart...expert adviser... This is the old series v11. Huge stop loss 250 pips.. edit first take profit reached, 2nd take profit on this old v11 series is 890 pips. trailing stop is 77 pips, so either EURAUD makes a big move or the end position stops out at the trailing stop, falls back to break even for 0 pips, closes above the channel hi which will act like a trailing stop or reaches 890 pips...

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Instaforex I downloaded all data available from History center, that is the way we should prepare before running backtesting, right? _________- Sequoia

--- 帖子 #765 ---
yes. so there is 90% modeling.. Backtesting does not guarantee future performance. So we are trying to see how protect against the unforseable with these rolling and walking forward tests, minimal stop losses, and maximum win rates.. If you can do it, it would be a big help, we need to find the set values for the other pairs for v14.2. Look over the procedure described in post #762 and see if you can try with a pair other than EURUSD and actually discover a usable set. Like maybe work on EURGBP. Start with the old set values for EURGBP v11 and follow the steps in #762. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=762 In your spare time of course!!

Working on the walking forward test. Lot of data to sort through and keep filed properly. What I am looking for is: Will the set file that has been optimized for the last 12 months in back test be profitable for the next month forward? Is 12 months the best length of time to optimize? Would 6 months be better? Will keep traders posted. Using v14.2, superior trading options. Relying more on macd cross than dss. So far results are very positive. Which means this would be a reliable technique to use for keeping the set files updated... Will look into what is involved with Duskacopy data feeds. 99% modeling.. For now we are slogging along MetaQuotes data at 90%.. And have v11 set up on the pairs in demos... edit: interesting that after spending many hours doing the ground work for walking forward testing the results are not at all what I thought they would be. What I see is that a set file that has been optimized for the previous 6 months and brings in very good profit, when it is applied to the next forward month (for which it has not been optimized) it acts in very unpredictable ways. For 6 such walks forward the total for the walks was a small loss, but when the optimization is looked at for the same period taken as a back test, it shows fabulous profit. Now what does that say about losing money??? We will get around these things. Thankfully we are finding the bug a boos.. One thing I notice is that the ea is built around a channel which is a variable. The more constants there are the better. But the entire strategy is built around a variable. It can be a strong point if the channel value can be regularly monitored. The only constant in the entire system is achieved by using only the macd default setting. Time of day for trading can act a constant also. So we have a rather large window for trading but it is constant and it is in relation to the most active market times. I will look at walk tests for 12 months for the same period that I tested for 6 months, maybe 6 months is too short a time. I will look for a significant change in increased profit. And be thinking what constants can be applied to the system? So that when we program in "when this, then that" the "when this" part is a constant...

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hi Jiva, that's me again . I found, that in new setting file for v14.2 (eurchf pair) there is difference between MACD setting used in .set file and MACD displayed from .tpl file. Which one is valid for this pair? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Posted the correct files in the zip for EURCHF v14.2 We are using default macd.(12,26,9). Thank you. So many details. I think I'm going mad.. Thanks for staying with this. Lots of twists and turns... What works and what doesn't. It's really important otherwise we will only lose our money... There's no getting around that truth... A lesson hard learned by those who are actually successful traders.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Hi Jiva, I agree it is silly to discount something until you have tested it and that is why I stopped objecting - I have been observing while you discovered on your own what I have been pushing you towards. The fact that I can take one of your set files and run it over a longer period and visually pinpoint on the p&amp;l chart the point where the optimization started told me all I needed to know. Incredibly you had managed to curve fit. I say incredibly because usually it would be easy to fit 30 or so trades over a year but with your new 14.2 you are fitting 130+ trades and still coming up with a .set file that is no better that tossing a coin for periods outside the optimized period.....that truly is incredible. The reason you are able to do this is that you have so many moving variables that you can structure a .set file that is almost like a "key" to that specific years data "lock". As you have rightly pointed out in your more recent posts you can try to hold some of these constant (macd etc) but as soon as you do that you will find that the EA will no longer perform nearly as well as it has been. Behind the scenes I have been running backtests across much larger periods but am yet to find a combination that will make the EA successful over most market situations. So we come back to where we started. It is clever that you have developed a key to fit most locks the real trick now is trying to understand WHY those variables are changing. The stoploss and Takeprofit settings have some effect but it is the macd periods etc that truly modify the EA's behaviour. It may be that there is no pattern to the changes that we can ascertain and unfortunately if that is the case it is very difficult to trade off a model that can only tell you what has happened and not what should happen. But as you say we are scientists so I will continue trying to understand how better to predict the changes in these variables relative to what the recent price action has been. I think the best place to start would be to do a 50:50 edge test on each 3mths or 6mths data i.e. keeping the SL and TP settings fixed and solving for all other variables and then looking at how those other variables are changing...are they random or can we find some pattern in their movement that we can link to the movement of some other indicator (or combination of indicators) running over the same data and therefore program the EA to move the variables on its own as the market dictates. Nobody said this was going to be easy! Jono

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Jiva, You may have already done this in your optimization process. Why not optimize for 1st 6mths, then with settings run for next 6mths and see results.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Again, thanks ever so much for your in depth analysis. We will get there... The main thing is the channel. A breach of the channel is the signal. The problem is the channel value is a variable. We can find a solution. We are saying the same thing now. To be able to tie in to some other measure that is not a variable. I was very surprised at the results of the forward walks. Of course it was a small sampling but still, it was a bit of a shocker. Traders can be easily fooled by these back tests. Back tests are useful to see if the mechanics of the robot are opening and closing trades properly but aside from that, for predicting profits, hmmm. Well not of much value from what I just saw. A bit like getting into the car and driving by looking in the rear view mirror. "Well the road has been straight for a mile or so now".... I have a few ideas I want to check out.. http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:x...-view1.jpg&amp;t=1

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Yes, That is the basic idea behind the forward walks I have been doing. I would backtest for 6 months then use that setting for a forward month. Rear view mirror...... http://www.whoslosing.com/blog/php/Tree-car-crash.jpg

--- 帖子 #774 ---
It is true it is easy to be fooled. However LONG dated backtests are valid as if you have a model that can function over the past 5+ years (and ideally as in Birts tests back 10yrs) then it becomes statistically impossible that you have curve fitted over that many changing market environments. You have done pretty well to fit over the past year with SL and TP at similar widths but as we have already seen even 18 months fitting is challenging. So anything that backtests over a long period and still looks consistently profitable with minimal drawdowns should be considered a valid guide for predicting profits. As you say we are both on the same page now and you see that in order to do this we need to understand the relationship between price action and channel size.....let's hope we can find it. Jono

--- 帖子 #775 ---
There are many advices but I want to see what they tried and how the result is..... I hope they aren't just a critic....

--- 帖子 #776 ---
I am just a critic. You are the ones doing all the work. I know you are getting tests with good results optomized for the one year. It would seem you need to test random periods of time. like the last 3 years, total, maybe june 2009 to august 2009 and march 2010 to now................... Things keep changing all the time. Thankyou for spending so much time and effort to figure out what works. Practice, practice, practice makes perfect. The more you put in the more you get out i hope. Iam trying to back test and forward, gets frustrating and complicated I always thought things should be simple, somehow, at least i have read that alot before.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I think jm2110 has good points about the curve fitting for back testing and how misleading that can be going forward. We are doing some more forward walks using different time spans... Let us see... We will post results... It is very time consuming. So it will take a little time to compile.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hey thanks for doing some testing. If we keep an open mind the solutions are out there... We'll find them. The amount of details involved is mind boggling. A big problem is just labeling and filing everything so I know what it is, so I can access later on.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Am taking backtest to 5yrs EURUSD and will see about forward walks...

--- 帖子 #780 ---
The idea of posting idea's on these forums is you get to share from everyone's experiences and hopefully create something better. Over a week ago I pointed out that despite the initial results from Jiva looked good there was a flaw in the logic due to curve fitting and rolling optimizations were in my experience not the way to go. I was trying to fast forward Jiva and direct attention to where things are headed now. If I had all the answers and knew how to make your EA perfect I would but this is a learning process for all. What I did know immediately when I ran the set files over much higher quality data from longer periods and could spot the optimized period was that this was a curve fit. Jiva now has discovered this the long way around by manually doing the forward walks but next time it won't take this extra week to make that conclusion. I understand what you say about criticism for criticism sake but I think the process Jiva has been through and the fact that everyone is now coming to the same conclusion shows that I am not wasting either of your time. I have the same goal as all of us here and that is to make a consistently profitable EA, let's hope that is possible.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi everybody, today I didnt go to school, I passed all day backtesting and searching to a good .set file ( Let me say this is a very very hard , time-eating work, thanks allot for every .set file you have done Jiva ), and I came up with an idea, as settings may change on the future to feat better th eeach pair : 1) there is an indicator that is used in THV to place SL , called 3xATR (in attached picture you can see it at the bottom) , this is obviously dinamic, we could use this to choose a more accurate 50:50 SL and TP for the trade about to be placed, depending on the market's current feeling. This could be done for eachone of the parameters (the most used variables in the EA's inputs) Jiva has been using more, to fit the curve on the backtest, this could help making the Ea more Dynamic to the markets condition. The is the solution I can imagine at this moment, mybe it is nothing but if we all come with ideas, in others could be lighten the spark of the real solution. Thanks Taiyakixz, Jiva , jm2110, kauaibobby and inso, Let's help to make this dragon get its' firts bones and joints. _______- Sequoia

Making suggestions, don't understand much about core operations to be a critic, what you guys do are selfless, kind of hard to criticize. I do have version 11 on couple of charts, results are ok. SL to high for my liking based on trade frequency (this could be considered constructive criticism , now i can be accused of being a critic). I will be messing around with MA when i get a chance thinking of SSMA 3, 7, 10, 14. Like the idea of having all these inputs. foward test lot slower than backtest.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Wow. Good stuff going on. We're gonna make this happen!!! Or maybe it is happening and we just have to see how to get on board, not get in the way and not get run over either.... jm2110 has mentioned ATR too. I'm not all that familiar with ATR. Maybe someone can explain how that might work. For the 50-50 test we want as low a stoploss as possible and since the profits have to equal the stop it is not so much of an optimizing issue. Maybe a little bit for the 50-50. 20 pips would be great but that is a little thin. Looks like between 20 and 30 or so is the sweet spot for a 50-50 test.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
The stop losses in v11 are way too high!! It's a disaster waiting to happen. v11 is being replaced by v14.2, stops are more like 30 pips... We will be interested to see what you find with ma...

Results of long range back test is very encouraging!! I backtested 10 years EURUSD for 50-50 stop loss 30 pips FXDD 11/4/00 to 11/4/10 optimized the channel and the moving averages. No dss, not3, macd default. then I took that set file and ran it for 11/4/09 to 11/4/10 very interesting.. here are 2 graphs 1st is the 10 year 50-50 optimized (win rate 53%) 2nd is 11/4/09 to 11/4/10 using the 10 year 50-50 set (win rate 68.90%) This isn't exactly a walk forward test. I will do some of those later.

It also had big profit targets... 2nd profit target is 890 pips!!! with trailing stop 77.... Looks like it is going to get there.... With a positive rollover along the way... currently +12.80 Just a note to illustrate a bit how the ea is designed to be able to catch a big move... The 3 types of exits....

Hi Taiyakixz what do you think about using the indi I posted before to place the 50:50 (SL &amp; TP) ? I see the common ATR indicator is like an oscilator. __________- Sequoia

--- 帖子 #794 ---
I'm not sure we want these values to be changing in 50-50. For the series we are developing now with v14.2 we are not looking to capture big moves, like v11 could do. We are looking for high win rate, with small stop loss and overall profit. Maybe Taiyakixz has some thoughts about ATR. I am seeing finding s/l and t/p for a 50-50 test is more or less a given. Mostly I see 30/30/30 is the sweet spot. Right now, at the present moment, I don't see how to incorporate ATR. I will put some time into experimenting with it. The idea of being dynamic with the market as it moves is very attractive. Usually it takes me a little while to assimilate. Thank you posting the indi, now it is on file..and we won't have to go searching all over everywhere to try to find it when we are ready. jm2110 also likes the ATR. So let's see where this goes. Have a good weekend everyone, and we will try to be as ready as possible for testing live market when it opens...

Thanks Jiva, you too have a great weekend . enjoy the weekend everybody

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Okay forget the weekend. I've got work to do... Here is the first in a series of walk test I will be doing. Very, very nice. Ol' jm2110 does it again!!! Evidently, backtesting can be effective if it is done over a long enough period of time. We will be experimenting with different lengths of time . Should it be optimize every month for 5 years optimized? every week 10 years optimized??? Something that is catching my attention is the possibility of a weighted optimization. Like there are exponential moving averages, weighted moving averages, etc. That give more significance in the end data to the later values in the series.... hmmm. How this test was set up. v14.2 EURUSD FXDD 1hr 5 years from 11/4/00 to 11/4/05 Optimized 50-50 take profit/stop loss setting for channel and moving averages. Use macd default for crossing no dss, no t3ma. These optimized settings for 11/4/00 to 11/4/05 were then used to run a backtest for the next year, 11/4/05 to 11/4/06. Here are the results... appx 1trade/week $5374 net on $10000 opening win rate 69.57% 13.48% max drawdown 30 take profit 1/30 take profit 2/30 stops edit: as usual I may have put on the party hat a little too early. Results of some of the subsequent walks forward in this series of tests are not so enlivening... We know what we are looking for with this, so we will keep looking... edit: this parameter is not right. This was the only forward test that was profitable out of 5 such walks. 5 years back to test 1 year forward is not statistically sound. I am starting a new series of tests: 5 years back 1 month forward.

Thank you for your hard work. You didn't go to school...was it okay...? Please do not fail... In regard to 3xATR, I know it is told good generally. I checked some charts but at the moment I don't find how it increases the performance with the EA. I think that you can check the chart manually and see how 3xATR works. Would you please check the chart and when you find that it is usuful, tell us how it works...? Of course you don't have to check all chart in many years, enough as you have confidence. This is what I want to say at my old post. Not only with this thread, I receive many PMs that xxxx is good, oooo is good, good idea to make an ea..... But they were not profitable. With most of them, it was very easy to find that they were not good. I am little tired of checking them..... I really thank for your hard work and your idea. I just want to say if you show me how it works, it would be great help. Please understand......

--- 帖子 #798 ---
thanks for your consern about school, no the reason I didn't go was because no classes that day (festivities in my country). Puff yes I know should be very anoying to be a very good MT4 programmer, evert newbie (like me) must have "The profitable idea, Holy grial" lol, and asks you for help, I dont want to be anoying, please forgiveme if I am being . Well about ATR : is an indicator that measures volatility , for example , in the THV system they sugest to place the SL at the distance that 3XATR(20) (ATR(20) multiplied by 3) suggests, this is because the market's current volatility. So for scalping (and most trading styles) you might want to place a good SL : 1) if your trade was good but the SL was too close, SL will be trigered before actually it makes profit, because of too much volatility. 2) if you place a very distant SL, and your trade goes against you, you would loose too much. (beacuse of too small volatility) So this ATR indicator, works to know the actual volatility and place this SL , if the system has a good winning/loosing percentage, (Like this one ) We could be seeing more profitable trades, because the volatility changes, and this way we could not be stopped by the SL before the trade goes to TP. I dont know how they did to change this ATR oscilator value into a logic number-distance to place SL , but if you want I can ask them, or search more about this, because many of the THV indicators code is closed. I hope I made a clear post, as you know my english is not the best ,if there is anything not clear enough please tell me, I will be pleased to clarify it. Thanks for your interest _________- Sequoia

oh I see, I thought you cut the class.....In Japan many students often skip the class which they don't think important.... Below is one example of 3xATR stoploss. The yellow line is stoploss. ATR at the opened position is 0.0033, so ATRx3 = 0.0099. This trade would be loss with 3xATR. I saw some trades like this. This is the reason why I don't code it at the moment. Of course I don't mean all trades are so, but I want to see some good trades with 3xATR before I code it. I think you can do the same way and check some trades by looking the chart. I want to see how 3xATR works and makes the EA more profitable. More trades better, but it is enough as possible. You could show me 3xATR's good working, then I will code it.

Debut!! v14.2 EURUSD 1hr 30 pip stop 50/50 edge test win rate 84.62% 12 month back test Around 7 trades/month max drawdown 7.85% +$25,957 on $10,000 initial deposit trading 1 standard lot. This is all rearview mirror. 12 months of testing forward walk tests show consistent profit. So let us see how the performance is for going forward. There will a few losing trades. But stop loss is 30 pips so life will go on... I have used another macd indi in the template, you will need to download it in order to be able to use it. The calculations are the same, I believe, just nicer to look at.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hi Jiva Are you sure that the .set file in the previous post was optimized over the 11/4/09-11/4/10 as if you look at my chart attached this is the same .set ran over 99% Dukascopy data from 1 Jan 09 - 27 Sep 10 (not right up to today as haven't done a recent Dukascopy download)? I presume your chart shows the past 12 months. If you look at my chart that point (i.e. 4th Nov 09) starts at trade 100. As you can see that is very close to the base of the p&amp;l chart where using the same set file from Jan-Nov 09 would have wiped out &gt;70% of your account. So I am a little confused here as give you said this .set file was optimized from April 09-April10 then we should expect that period (on my chart trade 35-145) to look great which obviously it doesn't as I am sure the optimization you chose wouldn't have had a 70% max drawdown. The fact that after trade 145 (april 10) you can see the p&amp;l pretty much has gone nowhere for the following 5 months makes me think you may have actually accidentally optimized the 6 month period Nov 09-April 10 (the only smooth upward slope on my chart) rather than the 12 months you indicated? As a side note as I know you are doing so many backtests I just wanted to double check that you realise that if you are running backtests optimizations over the weekend that unless you have guarded against it (various methods available) then all your calculations will be done assuming whatever bid/offer your broker currently has on their screen? This is likely to be much wider than normal over the weekend. My test attached is with correct bid/offer and 99% quality tick data so I am fairly confident my chart shows a true reflection of the effects of this .set file. Jono

I actually couldn't run the test at all for that month, so I just skipped over it. How much the missing month affected the overall data is questionable. Although it would affect the results at least somewhat without a doubt. This is 4-4-09 to 4-4-10.. Duskacopy is nipping at my heals... Thank you for offering to be there should I need to ask some questions.

As you can see that is very close to the base of the p&amp;l chart where using the same set file from Jan-Nov 09 would have wiped out &gt;70% of your account.&lt;&lt;&lt; This particular set file would not be valid for any time before 11-4-09. And will also not be valid for any time after 12-4-10 by the rationale I am using. These set files will be updated every month for past 12 months optimized values according to a method I have devised. Of course this is only one pair, over a certain time period. I will be running tests to see how valid this method is for other pairs in other conditions. From what I am seeing it will hold. Better data will be essential before considering using any real funds... Here is the graph results I am getting for 11-4-09 to 1-4-10. Which is the only time frame valid for this set that we would have in common given our different data. 11.64% max dd 66.67% win rate Keep in mind this is the graph of the back test not of walk forward. For forward test the set file is only valid from 11-4-10 to 12-4-10. Let me tell ya folks, you absolutely have to data if you wanna do this!!!! Just the filing and organizing of the data, etc. by itself is mind boggling...

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Something to maybe look into. Just a thought.. To have "no trade" when ATR shows volatility is high beyond a certain point. We do not want to vary the stop loss in this series. We want stop to be 30. I can look at some trades to see if this a good idea.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
I'm rly respectful towards ur treatment and effort for and in this thread guys, u guys just don't stop to search for weaknesses of this sys. , this ea is even running that great and u want to have s.th like the holy grail... i'm rly appreciated .. well, i hope i'll have time to take part in this thread again next few months.. sooooo.... let's rock this shit

--- 帖子 #806 ---
good point with ATR, but I'm not sure whether this idea is able to correlate with h1 timeframe? THV is based on M1,M5,M15 max. , did u even used it on higher timeframes? best regrads Phanti

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hey, glad to see you back. Yeah, Let's rock... To be honest with you, I've never used ATR at all. I just thought in general about how when the market is volatile like Sequioa pointed out, the stops need to be wider so they don't get taken out on a spike. But for this series we want to see how to trade with max 30 pip stop loss, so varying the stop loss according to volatility is not where we want to go . But that maybe ATR as a measure of volatility could be used to signal when a 30 pip stop loss trade might not be a good idea. If you want to research how ATR might be of value we will not stop you.

That's the point.. actually i won't to : D so let's see what next week brings

Well, I was warned Dukascopy download was slow. 10 hours later and EURUSD is 90% downloaded. Good thing is if the download is interrupted, it picks up where it left off.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Data, data, data... Running test for EURGBP for 2 days, wondering why the testa run so so so slowly. (Not set up for Dukscopy yet just using MetaQuotes) TWO DAYS!! and realized one little setting was off. Had to throw it all out. But now that setting is corrected, the tests are moving quickly.. It's gonna be a little while before I am set up for Dukascopy.. Unfortunately there is no adjustment I can make to make that downloading go any faster and it is slowwwww...

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I think if I recall correctly the file is 3 to 4 GB, so we are talking about a significant amount of data, hence the slow download.

can't follow, v.11 v.14 v.7 12394 v14v41849414 : P what's the plan right now?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
v14.2 has one set file that has been forward tested link is on title page v11 is more or less just set up for all the pairs on my demo. Just to keep an eye on things. Mainly I am tied up with getting the data set for Dukascopy and forward testing for EURGBP to add another set file to the EURUSD we already have for v14.2 So the plan is to see how to get reliable settings for going forward since just because a setting performed well for the last 12 months it doesn't mean it will perform in the next month. About all I know how to do at this point is to keep testing. Perhaps 12 months is too long to go back, maybe 6 months is better. Or maybe 10 years is better? I will not be able to do really serious testing until the 99% accurate data is set up. That is going to take a while. So to keep alive and focused on trading v11 is whizzing away. I am also curious to see how v11 performs in walks forward testing. The main objection to v11 and use of dss is the large stop losses. But I am curious. v14.2 and use of macd instead of dss has allowed to reduce the stop losses significantly. So this all takes lots of time. And even a little inattentiveness means hours of data becomes useless. So what traders that follow the thread can do is each according to their own level of involvement can take some aspect of the development and experiment with it. See if ATR helps somehow. preferrence for development is v14.2 I am pretty sure we will be phasing oput v11. as soon as we can get enough settings for v14.2. See if they can try to optimize v14.2 for other pairs. Try to get set up for doing walk forward testing. Do some 50/50 tests. The mechanics of the ea are running like a race car. There are no more bugs that I have seen and it runs smooth and fast. So now is seeing how become profitable. Use your imagination and let your creative juices flow. Personally, I'm neck deep in data processing. We want to turn data in $$$$$$$$$ http://www.velvetdicebag.net/images/vdb/63coins.jpg

wow....thanks a lot for this review....well ok.... when i compare this EA with others it seems that this one even works pretty nice so far.... so we dont have problems like 1000 pips DD and we dont have to flip a coin when to enter a trade.... if i had 1000 $ bucks for trading at the moment, i'd run ur EA jiva.... but... i'm a poor student at the moment : p

To run this live right now would be nothing more than gambling. Really no one serious about learning how to trade should be running this live, right now. We are determined to get it right, so that when we do use real funds it's a winner!!! I mean really!!! Would you book a flight to Bermuda in this????? http://davidwrightphoto.com/blog/wp-..._brothers1.jpg

--- 帖子 #820 ---
We are keeping eyes open for clues how to make this profitable. So v11 which relies heavily on dss is still set up and running on demos. v14.2 relies heavily on macd. It may be that both dss and macd need to be activated in the same settings rather than an either or.... The best of both worlds in one..... Both AUDUSD and NZDUSD are setting up for possible long in v11... edit: NZDUSD has opened long v11.

After spending hours and hours testing EURGBP I find there is 1 whole month that is missing from MetaQuotes so called 90% data. June-July 2010.. Ech!! what other surprises are there???? I surrender. Have downloaded the csv file and scripts necessary to convert the file for mt4. 99% accurate tick data!!! Let's see what is really going on with this ea.... Thank you, jm2110... It really isn't all that difficult given the nice directions here: http://eareview.net/tick-data It does take a little getting used to. And a lot of time.....

This testing has been done using MetaQuotes data. So it is not very reliable. We are in the process of using Dukascopy 99% commercial grade data (thanks to the persistence of jm2110) and results will be posted soon. So take these results with a good dose of salt.... v14.2 EURUSD 1hr 30 pip stop 50/50 edge test win rate 84.62% 12 month back test Around 7 trades/month max drawdown 7.85% +$25,957 on $10,000 initial deposit trading 1 standard lot. This is all rearview mirror. 12 months of testing forward walk tests show consistent profit. So let us see how the performance is for going forward. There will a few losing trades.

Hi Jiva, Taiyakixz thanks for your effort guys, you are amazing. I want to point out some strange behavior. This is not first time I encountered strange trade (w/ version v14.2, v.11). There was one trade opened w/ different brokers and one of them closed first position 6 min later at opened size (gain was 0) and 2nd position remained open w/ original SL, TP values and then closed w/ green pips. Second trade was processed correctly as designed. Please see details in screenshots, check price values and times. For comparing I attached good and bad trade. I noticed this behavior before maybe 2 times (not w/ the same broker).

--- 帖子 #840 ---
I wonder if it may be because the trailing stop loss for the 1st position is set to 0. Different brokers have different prices. So1st position was stopped out in one broker account but not in the other? The way the ea is designed is that 2nd position will remain open after 1st is closed.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
http://obiblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/data-pic.jpg We are not dead!! We may be buried in data files. But still very much alive and kicking. Will be coming out with new settings and a nice twist on the strategy. It's looking good. Very good..

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Hm, don't know. Yes indeed,1st position closed in one broker, not in another, you can see in my screens. Also I can remember the previous trade maybe 2 - 3 weeks ago (v11) - the same situation, 1st position was closed at BE and 2nd remained opened w/ initial TP and SL and when 1st position closed, the price went to oposite direction and hit SL of 2nd position and thus the result was loos of total 120 or even 200 pips (cannot remember exactly), I try to find that trade.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Does this symptom occur on only Colosseum....? If so, it would be hard to fix for it

--- 帖子 #844 ---
No Taiyakixz, I know, it wasn't only Colloseum. I run Dragon in 4 or 5 brokers, have to check at home later on to confirm that. So far to all traders: Please watch your trades closely, if they are processed correctly. I don't think I'm one and only, who has spotted it. I will update you as soon as I find another issue.

Trading algorithm for the 15 min: 1. Trades are only taken Tues., Weds., Thurs. and Friday(Friday may get phased out if it produces too many losing trades). 2. Trades are only taken between 1 hour after Tokyo open until noon NY. 3. macd default, dss default, channel is fixed at 2 ema. 4. Settings are optimized from the previous day to use for the next day. So for example after close of day Monday optimization is run using Mondays data to set up for Tues. 5. Simple optimization for 2 moving averages. One slow, the other fast. Both on the 15 min chart. 6. At present 1st take profit, 2nd take profit, and stop are all fixed at 30. (We will be seeing how best to optimize the 2nd take profit). Walk forward testing over 6 months for EURGBP using 99% modeling is showing a slight edge with win rate 53%. It has been consistent and we want to see how increase that. After studying many of these optimization graphs I am seeing that they can actually tell a lot about what is going on in the trading that can help for setting up for the next day. A link for the optimized sets for each new trading day, will be posted on the title page shortly after the close of each trading day starting at close of Monday, NY, for Tuesday. Close of Tuesday for Weds, etc.. These optimizations will be run on FXDD. It is simple procedure and traders are encouraged to run their own optimizations for their respective brokers. Take the basic setting from set file and check the box next to the moving average for fast (ma8) and check the box next to slow(ma7). Run the optimization for Monday's data and select the setting that shows the slowest for both the slow and the fast moving averages. It's a pretty generic set file and I don't see why this strategy couldn't be applied to almost any pair. Practical application will show which pairs are best. The values of the fast and slow moving averages will change. Everything else remains the same. Note: None of this is set in stone. It is just what we are presently working with because we are seeing some little bit of consistency and success. The charts show an example of a backtest and walk forward... The back test was done for the one day at the close of Thursday 8/20/09 to 8/21/09. From the list in the optimization results (chart #1) the set with the slowest slow and slowest fast moving averages was chosen. Chart #2 shows the optimization graph. They are not always this neat and clean. So it takes some practice to be able to chose the set that will perform the best for the next day. That chosen set from 8/20 was walked forward (applied) for testing the next day 8/21/09 to 8/22/09. Result was a continuation of the trend from the previous day's trading and good trade...

This is a great plan. But there may be a problem getting the data so soon after the market closes. It seems that MetaQuotes only has data available for up to about 1 month before the present day. If I get the data for the previous day from Dukascopy that will be good for me and anyone trading FXDD becasue I will post the sets. But it's not going to help traders who are using other brokers. They won't be able to optimize their settings unless they can get Dukascopy data also and to use the FXDD settings can be awkward. If I can get the previous day data maybe I can zip it and post it so traders can optimize their settings. But I don't know yet if Dukascopy has data for the previous day available that soon. I opened a demo account in order to get the downloads because it is the easiest way but now they are calling me on the phone "When am I going to open a live account?" The demo is only good for 14 days. Now I can't log on. I think they may have blocked it because I didn't answer the phone and have been downloading nonstop day and night. If we cannot get previous data in time for Tokyo open of next day then it's back to the drawing boards. There is another way to access the 99% data without opening a demo and I will have to spend some more time figuring out how to do that. Since this demo thing isn't going to work. hmmm. So many bug a boos... Then again maybe we don't need to optimize at all. Just use the same set all the time. A slow moving average and fast moving average. Will look into running that just as it is. For Mon(maybe not), Tues, Weds, Thurs and Friday(maybe not).. See how that compares to the test I ran for EURGBP with all the optimizing. I have sneaky suspicion it really won't matter all that much optimizing or not optimizing... for the actual live trading. That the data may only be important for back testing and forward walking to establish the algorithm but not for continually updating the settings. http://www.thinkwebdesigns.com/images/light_bulb.png Bare with me, we'll get there. Sometimes it take a little time, but it always takes lots of patience, strong determination and unshakable confidence of the ultimate success. http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townn...review-300.jpg

So the ea is capable, the strategy is valid, now we have to see how manage things so there is more good trades than bad.. So yes this is going to take a little time. I am still a little tied up in trying to get Dukascopy 99% data. There are a few more hurdles there and it is very time consuming. I was using the download through their demo but that is not going to be along term method. Now I have to figure out the php method which has no expiration date and no phone calls from Dukascopy "when am I going to open a live account"? But it is a little complicated. So time time time. Also we are working on a couple of small modifications to the ea. More sensitive to moving average slope, and stopping out truly at breakeven and avoiding spread fee... Sometimes just have to step back a little and survey the situation to get some insight for direction to go...

11/14/10 This week we will be testing a set strategy that walked forward very nicely in the few tests I was able to do. We doing the unthinkable and increasing the stop loss. Because this has tested nicely in forward testing we are not going to disregard it because of a larger stop loss. I still need to set up so that we are able to access the most recent tick data at 99%. That is going to take some to figure out but we are working on it. So these tests were done 90% (I'm spoiled and don't trust 90%, as it has been said "that 90% figure in the upper right hand corner is just a figure in the upper right hand corner")... But for now and for the sake of not just sitting and not testing anything. EURUSD 15minute Here is how we derive the settings: Optimized for the previous week, starting Monday open, ending Friday close. 1. For now 1st take profit and 2nd take profit both equal 30. 1. optimize together for channel, stop loss, 1, 15, 60, and 1440 moving averages. channel should be from 20 to 55 stop loss between 30 and 100 1m and 15m between 5 and 20 60m and 1440m between 20 and 55 3. chose a setting that looks reasonable. I like stop around 80, channel between 30 and 50. 4. run the setting in the week it was optimized for to see what the results look like. Were there a lot of trades but many of them losses? were there a few trades but all of them winners. (Prefer the latter) In general faster channels will produce more trades but a lot of them will be losses. Use the setting from this optimization for the next week in a walk forward test. The graphs show samples of testing results (which have been surprisingly consistent) with walk forward using this method: 1st graph is the backtest for the trades for 9/10/07 after optimization. 99%.. 2nd graph shows trading results using the set from that test applied in a walk forward to the next week 9/17/07 to 9/22/07.

In further testing the success rate is very very good for this method. Learning to know what setting from all the optimized settings is the trick. It can be done. There are red flags, what to avoid and also what to look for. I tend to get really excited and think wow this is it, we found it, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, so I don't want to fall into that with this, but this is the best I've seen yet!!!! The success rate in walk forward is eye-popping!! FXDD and Alpari tested the same for these settings. EURUSD, EURGBP, AUDCAD, EURCHF (15min 99%) For week of 11/15 thru 11/20

Getting the data for the previous week is not going to work relying on Meta Quotes. I really do not want to tackle php.. I envision computer crashes.. downloading from Dukascopy demo is easy. Only thing is a demo only lasts 14 days and they call you constantly on the phone, "open an account, open an account"... Well I just may have to open an account. To be able to get that good 99% data for the previous week so that we can set up for next week... It just might be worth it. They don't offer mt4 or I would just switch altogether. (I hope they accept US citizens now that US is a 3rd world country). $1000 to open. I really would rather do something else with the money but for that data....... Looks like I might have to. I'll keep opening demos and avoid answering the phone as long as I can.... We just need that previous week. MetaQuotes has whole months of data missing.... And all sorts of errors and who knows what else, black holes.... 90% doesn't mean a thing.... You can run a test and get results but they're no good!!! Only thing 90% is good for is to test the mechanics of the ea.

The new test setting for 15m has opened short EURGBP must have been a fast moving market, the positions were opened far apart. looks like AUDCAD has opened short too. Not one of my top picks for a pair to trade, but it was one of the ones that I could get the 99% data for...

14.2 ran some backtest with SSMA 3/7/10/14, disable other features macd .. ... EUR/USD and GBP/USD H1 charts ... results where not that impressive tried 30/30 TP/SL , still was not convinced, so let it run for week 2 week demo ... still needs to fine tuning ... changed SL to 90 , left TP 30 for both orders, will miss some long runs .... need 3 wins to 1 loss for break even .. think can get about 4/5 to 1 , GBP/USD not so good but EUR/USD have some potential . had to stop all demo as am away for next 2.5 mths but i think ready for the big leagues ... no bugs detected so far, so don't think there is any risk of blowing account if run for month live trading 10cent/pip and results are not good then will remove ... this is for new year though. Would like to be able to have Comment displayed (changeable), so can analyse better.

Okay. Don't want to blow anybody out of the water. Taiyakixz's hair is starting to stand on end with where we are going with this. If anyone wants to continue testing the established settings for the 1 hour, no problem. But here is the twist for next week. We are looking at inverse trades. I know ff has rules about promoting so I hope this doesn't transgress but I don't know any other way to set this strategy up without involving a broker who can facilitate taking the inverse. So here goes. Setting up on the 1 minute. Limit for profit 1 is 8 pips, limit for profit 2 is 8 pips, stop for both is 8 pips. Channel 2, dss 5,8, moving average 1, 21 sma. That's it. This will produce many more losses than wins. Somewhere around 74% or more for different pairs. I am using EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD. There are a lot of trades. I mean this is the 1 minute chart!! So there will be a lot of losses. How to capture the inverse so they are registered as wins. There may be other ways but this is the only way I now how to do it at present. I hope this isn't setting up any red flags with ff... If it is please let me know. This is only to see how to capture the inverse. Open a signal provider account with Zulutrade. Link an mt4 demo account which is where the trades will be placed. Open a demo account with Zulu and link it with the signal provider account. Set the Zulu demo to reverse. A buy in the mt4 becomes a buy signal in the provider account, but when it gets to the demo is becomes a sell. There it is the inverse... There is a lot to consider in trying to capture the inverse because the spread skews things. Buying higher and selling lower etc. But the idea is a fast moving scalping application. 3 pips profit over and over again could be huge if the account is set to %balance for lot size. So an 8 pip loss could translate in inverse to 2 or 3 pips profit after spread. Will be running this in FXDD mt4 linked to Zulu signal account and taking inverse trades in Zulu demo next week. Like I say Taiyakixz's hair is starting to stand on end... But let us see....

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Can't code just be modified to change how order is sent ... so instead of sending buy signal it sends sell and visa versa ...

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Yes. Taiyakixz has very kindly coded a simple inverse ea for experimentation. What we find is that it doesn't work that way. Because of bid and ask, the bid always being less than the ask, the difference in spread, as minimal as it is, actually causes very different signals. It is not just a mirror reflection, it has skew, spreadx2. But I feel the idea has a lot of merit and there is a way to do it. There a lot of pieces to the puzzle and they are falling into place little by little. If it was so easy we would all be billionaires by now. So patience, determination and confidence... I am attaching the simple inverse ea so you can experiment if you like. Here is what I am looking at. 1.We have been running up against problems finding an appropriate channel value. The market changes. How do we find the right value? 2.If we find a decent channel value the ea is very good at making trades during trending when a buy is a buy and a sell is sell. But during consolidations it is a disaster. (what else is new?) 3. Trading inverse, a sell is a buy and buy is a sell, consolidations become traders paradise. All the losses now become wins. However when there is trending the ea makes all losses. How to reconcile the two basic market conditions? I am thinking to research use of adx. I will be looking at this. For instance adx above 20 no trades for inverse. Since that is very often an indication of trending... below 20 no trades for original buy/buy sell/sell. We want to see how to put it all together, without Taiyakixz jumping off a bridge.. Perhaps 2 versions running simultaneously. One version becomes active adx above 20, the other version becomes active below adx 20. These are just ideas. But I will be looking that these things this week. The channel value may not be as much of a problem as I thought. It could be that using 2 channel is all we need to do. This catches breakouts for trending, and identifies good entries for inverse during consolidations. So here we go. Let's see how far we can go with this. adx may just be what we are looking for... trend no trend...

--- 帖子 #866 ---
I am yet to look in detail at what you are proposing but alarm bells starting ringing when you said Taiyakixz's inverse model didn't give you the results you are looking for. Are you sure by reversing the signals like you are suggesting (i.e. through Zulu) that you aren't trying to buy at the bid side and sell at the offer side? eg Let's say in the original model the underlying mkt is 1.3200 /1.3202 and the model says sell so we sell at 1.3200. In Taiyakixz's inverse model it will say buy so we buy at 1.3202, however what you are suggesting I think is that you would like to buy at 1.3200....and if that is the case you can see why that isn't going to work. Jono

--- 帖子 #867 ---
No that is not what happens. The buying and selling are going on in inverse just fine. His inverse ea is very simplified ea and has not been developed at all. We are using the v14.2 for the inverse strategy. Granted the cost of the trade is significantly more in inverse. Spread x2. But if the success rate is high then we can absorb it. This week will be a good test. This can only be tested in live demo for any reliable results. Back testing doesn't really show what happens with the inversion very well. Can only guess at it. So demo this week. Of course back test shows terrific consistency for losing. % in the 70's. But trying to capture those losses and turn them into wins is another story. We'll know soon enough... I am attaching another set file for v14.2 that has shown even more losses than the set file in the previous post. Just look at this gorgeous graph and picture it in inverse... modeling quality on the 1m is never that great... But we can get the idea....

--- 帖子 #868 ---
This has all gone from simple to super complicated. Good luck.

I don't know how you can say that... http://cache3.asset-cache.net/xc/200...29E79887609E4F

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Inverse. Because the spread is 2x, the stop is bigger and the take profit is smaller. So for instance I am trading FXDD with fixed spreads . EURUSD is 2 pips. If the ea is set for 8 limit and 8 stop, when the inverse is taken the limit is now 8-4, profit 4. And if it gets stopped out the loss is now 8+4, loss 12. So that definitely changes the risk reward ratio. risk 12 to make 4... There is another cost too, in order to capture the inverse, using Zulu there is another charge of 1 pip. Risk is actually 13 and reward is 3. So it looks good on the chart. But the costs are too high. Maybe using another broker with smaller spreads like Alpari could work... But 2 and 3 pip spreads is too high... Or maybe just use the signal from the ea in one demo and place the trade manually in another account. Stop 8, limit 8. None of this 2x spread or Zulu fee for inverse etc... So ea opens short, place the trade long manually in another account. Since this is scalping on the 1 minute it need not be an all day affair. there can be 100 signals or more in an hour for the 3 pairs. Not exactly automatic trading, but using the ea as a signal provider. I will be testing this during the week.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
From a 4hr to 1hr ea to an inverse 1m ea using zulu...... now not automated but as an advisor only. That's how I can say that.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Jiva You have sure been working hard to get this to work. I am still with you. We are all learning alot. i dont know how to help you, it get confusing, but i know your on the right path. We all have to keep trying if we want to be succesful at this. No one said it was going to be easy. keep up the good work and you will figure it out.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
If I knew all the answers I probably wouldn't be posting on the forum. I value the constructive input and feedback from other traders. We are trying a number of approaches and finding the weak points in the different strategies. The 4hr had it's drawbacks, the 1hr would not give good walk forward results. So at present we are seeing if we can adapt to shorter term trades like the 1m. I apologize for any confusion but we are trying to develop the basic strategy into a workable profitable system. I wish I could just hand everything to everyone on a silver platter. No muss no fuss, just plug it in and rake in the bucks. But I can't. If anyone has such a system please let us know.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
okay here are some preliminary results from 1 hour before Frankfurt. charts show 1. first chart is the ea opening and closing trades. 2. second chart are manual trades in inverse. When ea opens long, manual trade is short and vice versa... I didn't take every trade that the ea opened. It goes pretty fast on 1m chart. And this only shows the EURUSD trades. There were some good AUDUSD trades also..

--- 帖子 #876 ---
I didn't mean to sound critical. I am not a coder and not very advanced with computer skills. lol You've been gracious and helpful to everyone here and I know you will nail down a good ea. I guess I am just sorry the 1hr didn't work out the way we wanted. Wish I was able to help.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
I know exactly what you mean about the 1 hour. But it just didn't pass the walk forward tests. The main problem was the variability of the channel values. the 4hr is not a good time frame to begin with since the candles form differently for different brokers. So to try to work together with 4hr is not possible. One thing is the consistency of the losses on the 1min using a particular setting. So we are trying to see if we can take advantage of something that is consistent by trading opposite. I have seen trading histories that would make anyone's hair stand on end, I mean success rates like you would just not believe, 1200% in one month, where the trades are no more than 4 or 5 pips each and there are hundreds and hundreds of them, using %balance determines lot size. I mean turning $500 into $10,000 or more in one month. So I know it is possible. Some traders are doing it. Would I like to know what those traders are doing!!! Anyway, thanks for checking in. We will keep plugging away at it.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Who wouldn't want those kind of returns! I'd pay top dollar for an ea like that! M

--- 帖子 #879 ---
I have a hard time understanding why reversing the trades doesn't work while manually copying them does. The spread is the spread. You can't end up paying twice the spread by taking the reverse signal. You simply take the signal at bid instead of ask or the other way around. You pay the exact same spread either way.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Yes, it is hard to get the mind around it. It also has to do with exiting. So then it is 2x less profitable... if the stop and limit are set then when it reverses the stop becomes the limit and the limit becomes the stop and spread is there too.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
If that's the case can't x pips be added/substracted to take care of that ? Since it's 2xspread you add/substract 2xspread. Like you substract 2x spread for buy entry and add 2xspread for sell. Wouldn't that work ?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Yes that is exactly what I have been playing around with last few days. But you would be surprised how much of a difference it can make with just a few pips especially for scalping... We're onto something extraordinary... Taiyakixz has so graciously once again put the supreme effort into coding.. we now have v14.2 inverse. It's a powerhouse. v14.2 original can capture breakouts from range bound markets but has losses in consolidating markets. v14.2 inverse captures trades in a range bound market but has losses in a trending market. It's like Jack sprat could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, if you can follow that... so the challenge is to figure out how to let the ea know when it is a trending market and when is a range bound market. I've been looking at a number of trending indicators, cci 55 seems to be something that might work.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Why do you think of adding new indicator immediately after I sent you inverse ea? You told nothing about cci before I made inverse ea. You told me eagerly that 14.2 inverse makes profit. Show me the good result of 14.2 inverse.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Dear friend, We are learning as we go. What works, what doesn't work. This is part of the designing and developing process. We have a long history together of trial and error. We have come a great distance thus far. I have outlined the hurdle we now face, as I understand it: There are 2 basic types of market activity. Trending and sideways. The original 14.2 is able to capture breakouts by buying on a breach of the channel hi and selling on a breach of the channel low. That is very effective for trending markets. But in sideways markets there many losses. The inverse14.2 which you have so nicely provided is able to trade successfully in sideways markets by buying on a breach of the channel low, and selling on a breach of the channel hi. But in a trending market it has many losses. We are finding that the problem is not channel value as we thought it might have been, but rather whether the market is trending or sideways. So we find that we need to identify when the market is trending and when it is sideways. Of the different indicators I have been looking at cci set to 55 seems to be able to clarify this. I am testing it manually in the simulator and the demo. I will report the findings. These new challenges appear as we go. So far we are finding the solutions as the new situations appear. And then moving on to next level of development. There are no guarantees but we are giving this our best shot. If we can pull this off we will have a robot that can trade successfully in any market condition. Or maybe 2 separate robots one for each market condition. That will be something!!!! We thank you as ever for your efforts.

Hi Jiva It is good to see you working hard on trying to figure this thing out. I was going to say figuring this beast out but that is already taken. Speaking of the beast ea i am trying it out on demo, it is a crazy ea, like most eas that i read about, and i am no expert, that is for sure. Steve hopwood sure does crank out the eas for anyone that wants them it seems like. You talked about big profits in a month which is good as long as you dont have bigger lossssssses in the next month. It seems like all the eas i look at have all big stop losses or no sl at all. It all seems good trade after trade after trade and then boom it all blow up and you lose it all. i like the idea of having a robot doing the trading because then your imotions dont get involved unless you dont trust the ea. I dont have the time or the patients to sit watching charts. i hope it doesnt come to that. Watching charts that is. It seems like the only real way to make money at this game is with pure price action, noindicators, no nothing just the up and down of the price and try to figure where it is going to go next, and lot of people make money that way. Some how you have to know how what the big boys and girls are thinking, because they are the one who are making the market move, i believe. I will just keep on learning here until i figure this stuff out. Thankyou for all your hard effort and know you will figure something great out.

If it was so easy we would all be billionaires by now. It can be done. It is being done. We will do it.... Step by step... No huge stop losses. No blowing up accounts. No gambling. We are scientists.

okay. Here's the kind of things I am looking at. This is the 5m chart EURUSD trading the inv strategy manually in a demo in order to test cci 55. Just using dss 21,34, cci 55 and the ema 2 hi lo channel So for inverse when all signals say buy, we sell and when all signals say sell we buy. This only works in sideways markets for obvious reasons. So in this chart all signals were sell but cci was between +100 and +100 identifying a predominantly sideways market. So the trade was inverse. And good. We bought at the bottom of the range instead of selling at the bottom. Even though all the signals were to sell...... dss was red, the candle closed below the channel low, cci said there was no trending down... sideways... As it turned out we caught a breakout to the upside. This is a great trading strategy and can be traded manually. Less than 5 min chart gets a little coo coo. I'll be trading this manually for a while. But we want a robot who can watch the market all day, never miss a signal, never make a mistake, doesn't get eyestrain, etc... edit: few minutes later caught the same set up again....

I don't want to even write such a thing, but.... trial? Do not change the word after I made the ea. With previous inverse version, I told you that it did not make profit. Whatever I told you, you told me eagerly that it was profitable and to make it. After I made the ea, you just said sorry and tought the next idea. You didn't study anything by it? Not only you, many members told me to make a ea, they told that those strategy were profitable and very good, but after I made the ea, they said, 'just testing'. I am sick of them. Of course I know that repeating trial and error is needed, but there are infinite number of strategies including stupid ones, I can't make all of them and I don't want to do it. When you don't know whether the strategy makes profit or not and you want to test, then you write so, if someone is interested in it, he/she would make the ea. I wanted you to study investigating the strategy carefully, but whatever I told, you just repeated asking me to make the ea. Your many mails and posting many messages bothered me, I made the ea because I wanted you to stop them. Now I am not interested in your strategy. Bye.

I will be looking at how cci may be used for 14.2 original (the breakout trending version) One of the problems there was buying a top and selling a bottom. And also staying out of sideways markets, cci could help to leave all of those trades for 14.2 inverse... while keeping 14.2 inverse out of trending markets... So this could be a very reliable swing trade combo... macd and the moving averages are helpful for 14.2 original, but not so significant for 14.2 inverse. Anyway these things become known more as we try to use them. They start out as what looks like a good idea and then we try to develop it... Some of things work and some don't. Check slope function looked like a good idea but it is not so useful, and we tried a few different variations of stopping out in the v7 series which we abandoned. I want to keep testing this new idea for identifying trending and sideways markets in demo and the simulator for a while. With both v14.2 original and v14.2 inverse. I'll trade the 5min because it moves quick enough to get several trades in so we can sample what's going on, the 1m is too jumpy.... If anyone else wants to simply test the strategy manually that would be great. Then we can know a little better if it is worth the efforts of coding.

let's see how this goes. This was a setup for 14.2 original. cci says market trending, all buy signals.. stop 20 tp 20 20 pip stop is little tight... changing it to stop 30 tp 30 This might not work out since many of the filters we usually use for 14.2 original are not being used here. Such as macd on the 1m and multi time frame moving averages. So this may not be a fair test.. for 14.2original. The trade based on v14.2 original was not good, I thought so, since we didn't have use of the full functions in the manual test, however the next trade based on v14.2inverse was good.

We are sorry to see you go. We understand how it can be frustrating. A large part of the problem is simply turning what is a fairly decent strategy into one that is successful in automated trading. Thank you for all you have done. Good luck, my friend.

It looks like we've lost our coder. Feels a little weird to try to develop the ea any further without the coder. We've come so far along with this, and at the last minute Taiyakixz has a fit and jumps ship. The pieces are just starting to really come together for automation. http://www.tangotang.com/Mambo/image...ing_hg_clr.gif I'll keep trading v14.2 inverse with cci 55 but it is looking like it is ready to go. We need to add cci to v14.2 inverse. I can try to do it, but my coding skills are rudimentary to say the least.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Okay here's the plan. The robot is going to have be put on hold for a while. Without someone to work with for coding we can't go any further with it. This is not the end. Just a pause that refreshes.... I have confidence in this ea so we will wait a bit and see how to go further. It is funny because we are so close to getting it to run after exploring so many avenues. Just before the the final stage is set, the door slams shut... Thanks to all who gave so many good ideas. I learned so much from everyone. Will see you soon. Am going to trade the v14.2inverse strategy manually for a while. I'll be over here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=268142

I think this robot just needs to be forward tested with different settings. I have been using SSMA 3-7-10-14 only, disabled other filter, because i think it is similar to a manual strategy i was looking at. so far ok. TP 30 / SL 90. Started live this week, just running off my laptop as i am away from home so it is only on overnight EST, and so far have been ok. just trading EUR/USD .... using .01 lots so risk is minimal. We should not be looking for 100% accuracy, I think this is the problem. As far a trend ... using a few moving averages will keeps you out of a ranging market, only problem will be when trend changes, so you have to a balance

Hi, I am very interested in this strategy, but I do not see any activity on this thread for many months. Are you still working on it/with it? Tx, Bob

The ea has a lot going for it. Feel free to experiment with it. am always fiddling with this or that... Am currently trading a day strategy with success. The only time I've made money consistently in forex. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=326033 Stop by the lounge when you get a chance.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=271399

Thanks for your reply. I am only a junior member, so I can not visit the lounge, but hopefully one day soon. Glad to hear that you are still using DSS Bressert. Currently I am experimenting with daily positions but taking signals off the 1 Hr charts. I use a variety of indicators as correlates, but mainly I am a trend follower using 8, 34, 200 periods primarily.

I've narrowed it down to moving averages. No more indicators. This is really nice ea. Three moving averages. Probably the most popular trding stategy in the world. Noticed something interesting. If the middle average is less than the fast moving average there are some interesting trades. Not exactly a reverse setting but similar... http://www.tradingsystemforex.com/ex...-modified.html

Thanks for your suggestion. I will give it a try. PRICE RULES!!, but I need visual aids that I can compare across several time frames - hence my interest in indicators. Right now I judge trend with HA candles, my 3 MAs and DMI particularly on the Daily and 4Hr charts. I want to see price leading the MAs and DMI confirming. Then DSS Bressert for trade signals after a cross in OB/OS zones. DMI convergence and for sure a cross seems to work pretty well for intermediate trend change warnings. Have you looked at Ichimoku Clouds by any chance? Perhaps a help with Money Management.

Don't use real money until you know exactly what you are doing. Have a strategy and stick by it like lines in stone. Otherwise you will just lose your money, guaranteed.. Any successful trader will tell you this. Also simple is better. The simpler the better. Because market conditions change so much, a simple system is more easily able to adapt to the changing conditions. The more parameters needed for a system to trade the less it's able to adapt to changes in the market. Yup. Money management!! Even a mediocre system can be a winner with good money management. Probability is basic factor. All a system needs is slight edge in probability. Good luck..
