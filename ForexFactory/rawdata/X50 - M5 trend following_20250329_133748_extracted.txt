I admire those folks who can spot the trades on the higher time frames. I try but I'm not always able to watch the market and I always seem late to the party. So I've been searching for an approach that I might trade when I was available to trade. If I have a few hours early morning or evening, I wanted a system that would be active and that required that I move the M5 timeframe. This M5 system needed a name and a fellow trader suggested "X50" because the trade is lead by the 5-3-3 stochastic crossing 50. I take no credit whatsoever for the system as it was cobbled together as follows: 5-3-3 from spud's methods MACD 5-13-1 from that famous H4 MACD thread - worth the read Absolute strength indicator from Glenn5t The rules for entry are as follows: M5 stochastic 5-3-3 leads the way and must be above or below 50 M5 stochastic 14-3-3 is also in the same window and it's nice to see it moving with the 5-3-3 and for good setups it will also cross 50 before you enter MACD 5-13-1 must cross the zero line, at least one bar, sometimes two Absolute strength must also be in agreement and have crossed The rules for exit - take your profits when they appear and don't get greedy. There will be many many M5 opportunities. If the trade isn't going your way within 5 to 10 minutes, you might consider exiting and waiting for the next opportunity. However, it's not a scalping system. The notion is to catch a 5 minute trend and ride it for a while. I look for 30+ pip moves. These 3 indicators, when in agreement, have me on a string of winners. I try to implement other people's systems with mixed results. This method seems to works consistently for me. It seems to work with any pair and I have not tried it on other timeframes. I'm attaching a screen shot of a trade entry. My template is below, along with the indicators. Only the M5 view is for this method...the other timeframes are what i use for those timeframes. I offer it as my way of thanking the many generous folks on this forem who help other people like me. I'd be interested in suggestions to improve the method and hope that others may find it helpful. I'm quite busy at work these days so I may not respond right away if there are any questions. EDIT: You may also refer to post #183 for an alternative way to trade x50. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi Canuck, Congratulations on your terrific system! As you know, I've been putting it to use myself with mostly profitable trades, and it has been largely responsible for breaking my losing streak. My trades are ususally shorter than yours, as the slightest retracement tends to chase me away. Nevertheless, even if I pick up only 3 or 5 pips at a time, it's possible to trade this system many times throughout the day, so it tends to add up nicely. Can you explain the purpose of the "Rhythm" line at the bottom, and how to interpret what it tells us? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Good idea....Congratulations on taking the next step. Will watch with intrest.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Jeff, I got this indicator from the H4 MACD thread. From looking at the code it considers 8,21,89,200 and 365 moving averages and gives you a sense whether a trend is developing. I think it's a keeper for me as I need the visual that I'm on track. I am trying to catch a 5 minute trend and not just a scalp. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Good going Canuck. I have subscribed to your thread and I will watch and post with great enthusiam. I have your template in place and look forward to trading. Have you also noticed that the G/J will make a "Canuck" formation @ 19:00 GMT almost every day? Today's Canuck was worth +100 pips and it started @ 18:55 GMT. Now I just need to be home in front of my computer at that time!!! T4K

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hey Tim, I've have had several successful trades with G/J as well. Intersting how that pair will oscillate between those round numbers. I count about 12 such moves in the past 24 hours. If your catch it it's over in 20-30 minutes and you only need catch a part of the move. It happens many times throughout the day. You also need to watch some of the other pairs. It seems to work on many pairs. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Good work Canuck. Do you only trade the 5m? Ever trade the 15m or higher and go for larger moves?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
He has already answered this:

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Ocelot, I'm only trading M5. To be honest, I've not even looked at other time frames with this. If you do, please provide some feedback. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Here is a trade I just took. Closed at +24. Because of low momentum this time of day, waited for 2 bars on macd as confirmation. Trade over in less the 15 minutes with no heat. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Way to go Canuck, I love the 5 min thing on the gbp/jpy, as you know. Good luck with mentoring and your trading. BS

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Whoops, you did already answer that one. Sorry to clutter up the board! I'll demo trade the 15m and post my results...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
For some reason I can't get the MACD indicator to open on the chart. Anybody else had this problem or have a solution? Thanks, in advance.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thank you for posting this system. Since you posted I have made 3 trade the first to profitable of +84 pips together. The first trade was +40 and second +44. I have a short trade open at this time and it's about to hit it's target of 209.60 GBP/JPY. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I had to add my own MACD and set the settings!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
You need the file called MACD H4 300 V100 on the following message: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=817 I had the same problem T4K

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi CanuckCT, Thx for share your system. I like 5M, i will test it. Will watch this thread too !

--- 帖子 #18 ---
thanks for sharing your system CanuckCT,i do have problem trying to load up the 'absolute strength' indicator in the chart(i did download the indicator fr your post).Is it normal that i will see different indicators under different timeframes? thanks

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You have to compile it I think Open Meta editor and double click on the indicator that you need to compile. Then go to "File" and click on compile If it gives you the message : 0 errors and 0 warnings you are in business. Thanks Canuck for sharing this method with us. Looks very promising indeed.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Or just restart metatrader. . Interesting system. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
i did close and re-open my mt4 but no luck,anyone knows?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I noticed that if I have a large number of files in my indicator folder, sometimes mt4 doesn't recognize all of them. I cleaned mine out today (just moved the least used ones to another folder in case I need them again) and the performance is much better.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
thanks!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Does the rythm indicator also need to be in agreement with the other 3 indicators in order for it to be a valid signal? Example, right now on the E/J the stoch, MACD, and absolute are giving a short signal but the rythm is reading Rythm=1 Weak Bull. What do you do in that circumstance?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
If that wasn't a valid signal it still wasn't too shabby. A little over 30 pips in less than 15 minutes!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
See post #4. We're trying to catch a trend. The indicator is a measure of the strength of the trend re price and a number of moving averages. You could ignore this indicator and ou'll be fine with the signals. When it's weak, I'm a bit weary. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #27 ---
You may want to ignore the other timeframes as I have this template setup for a different view on H1, H4 and daily that have nothing to do with the M5 entry. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for the reply. One more question. Just wandering what broker/data feed are you using? I have an NF demo and use another broker to place my trades and after looking at your screenshots it looks like your chart data very closely matches my brokers. So maybe I'll switch since the NF data is much different from my brokers.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I've added this indicator to the first post. Sorry about that. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I use Oanda for orders and I use Metatrader demo from http://www.metaquotes.net/ for charts. I'll usually try to put the order in on the demo if I plan to post the shot. The actual order for the AUDUSD trade was with Oanda and I had already exited before I took that screenshot. I also have an InterbankFX account that I'm not really using as it only has a few dollars in it. Charts can be quite different from broker to broker. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Firstly, I'd really like to congratulate can CanuckCT for such a wonderful method. A bit of a deviation from original spud's methods, but hey, if the foundation is strong, why not build bigger and better on it. With regards to the above quote, it would actually be beneficial for you(and everyone) to know what critieria constitutes what condition, ie strong/weak bull/bear market. If you go to the 4H thread by philip nel, and look for the poster, Palmer, he has a website signature. Go to the tools one, and there is an explaination of how the indicator works. Briefly, it basically looks at the closing price of the candle in relation to certian moving averages. Hence, it can show one signal on the 5M chart, and another on the 15M chart, and maybe even a total opposite on the 1H chart. Just thought I'd throw this out there for everyone looking at indicators!! Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you very much. I'll check it out.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hello kermut, Thanks for the kind words and the link for Palmer post. You can tell by the code on the indicator what moving averages it looks at. Will check it out. Two things...I thing new traders (I include myself in that group as I am relatively new to Forex) should read all the spud material as it's a great introduction to trading and will help you to get your feet wet. Second I think that MACD thread is also very good. In regards to spud's methods, the 5-3-3 and 14-3-3 stochs are from his approach and I always felt they were good indicators for entry but not for exit. Also, for me I needed some other type of confirmation to support that I was getting into a trend that would last for at least a few candles rather then reverse right away. Just stochastics often gets you in, you suffer a retracement, exit, and then see the trade move in your direction without you. That was my experience. So this method waits a bit longer than the initial stoch entry and you have better confidence that the trade will go your way. If it doesn't almost immediately, exit and wait for the next signal. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I have 2 charts to review...the first is I trade I took on GJ, entry rules met and price had touched the pivot twice. Closed for +30. I should have stayed as 14-3-3 stoch never really went above 20 for more than a minute or so...an indication of a retrace. The second is a chart for EU. I did not take any of these trades, but I see 3 as follows. First is a buy and target would have been the pivot. The second is either another buy after the retrace and close over the pivot. Re-entry like this seems to be a better move. MACD was already above zero and stochs and AS indicate a buy. The third EU trade is a sell, target would have been pivot. If you had stayed you would have done a lot better. Each trade would have netted you a minimum of 10 to 15 pips with little heat. I just wish my job wasn't getting in the way to trade more often. I have a chfjpy trade in the works. Will post next. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Was up +10 on this trade and didn't take profits. Closed for -3. 14-3-3 stoch moved above 20, following the 5-3-3. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Question: On the EUR/USD trade, the entrance requirements were met two bars before you indicate with the vertical line. Why would you have waited? Thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Bill, You are right and you could have entered at that point. I would have waited to see the AS indicator cross and start to move up, in the direction of the trade. At the first bar, the AS indicator would have just crossed and a bar or two later would start to move in the direction of the trade. The more conservative entry is to wait, the more aggressive entry is to enter on the first bar. Same issue with the GJ trade. I'm a bar late on the entry according to the strict rules in post #1. I'm looking for a trend to show and sometimes a delay of a bar will help with that. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Everyone, A few of us had been chatting and trading together in a room. We didn't get a lot of traction in the room, but I still think the idea was a good one. Since everyone trades at different time, it's often difficult to meetup with someone. So I offer the room up to anyone who would like to drop by and trade this method. I keep strange trading hours...sometime early morning or late evening...maybe an hour during the day. Hope to see some of you there. Getting into the trading room is as follows: !. Go to http://ensign.editme.com/chat and click on the download link, just under INSTALLATION. 2. Download and save the setupchat.exe file and follow the setup instructions at the ensign site. It's easier than it looks, and you will be setup completely in less than five minutes! 4. Login to our room #56 - x50 Password is x50 Look forward to seeing you there! Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Canuck, I'll be there Monday morning. I enjoyed trading in the room with you and some of the other guys; hopefully we'll have more attendance now with the introduction of your X50 method, and the room will be active more hours during the day! Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
That's great trading. Perhaps you could post a few screen shots of your entries. 30 to 40 pips on GJ is a nice target on one trade. Glad to hear it's working for you also. Have you looked at any other pairs? Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Canuck and Jeff and whoever else, Do you guys trade the opening of the euro and london sessions? I'm on the west coast so that's 11pm and midnight respectively (for me). Good times to trade for night owls with day jobs like myself.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I generally trade 9:00 AM to 12:00 noon here on the east coast (GMT-5), and occasionally the early Asian session from around 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Canuck, I have to say this method is pretty solid. I took 40 pips last night. I have a day job, so i pretty much just trade the asian session. I'm sure i'll see you in the room. happy trading, cl

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I like this method I dropped the 5 minute a long time ago for longer timeframes to capture bigger moves and reduce the impact of spread. However, contrary to popular opinion, I have found it much more stressfull. You can be in positions for days at a time and that is a fulltime job. You dont get a break. The trade is always on your mind. I am on holidays atm but I had an open position that needed quite a bit of attention given recent moves. Obviously, this is not an ideal way to live. Well done in developing a system that allows me to trade on my terms and get my life back. I am very familiar with spud and phill nells work so your system is an easy step for me. I look forward to switching off both myself and my pc next time I trade

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for the template and system. Just curious why and how you use the Absolute Strength indicator? Thnaks,

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I use this indicator because another system I'm reviewing for H1 timeframe uses it. The cross and steeper angle seems to coincide with a good entry. You'll notice the MACD cross and AS cross appear together on the good setups. Do you have any suggestions/comments about this indicator? Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hey MAC This is precisely why I ended going back to M5. I was having a stressful time with higher timeframes. I would like to go there, but right now I'm just not smart enough to do it. With this, you have two hours, you trade two hours, and then get on with your life. A successful futures and bond trader I met several years ago told me never ever hold a position overnight. You should be able to make you living and sleep at night with your cash in the bank. He traded a breakout type system which I guess is what this is. I've never forgot that advice, nor have I been able to implement it. Hoping this method will allow me to do it. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Canuck; Do you have a favorite pair for this strategy or do you preferred looking for opportunities with various pairs? Also do you trade only during specific time period? Thanks

--- 帖子 #49 ---
No favorite pair - GBPJPY, EURUSD, AUDUSD....but I scan about 10 pairs for opportunities on the 4th minute of every 5 minutes to identify opportunities and then focus on 2 or 3 opportunities, and pick one, sometimes 2. MACD near crossing is easy to identify and that's what I look for...then the stochs and AS need to make sense. I'll trade any time period if there is some evidence of momentum. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #50 ---
hi canuck, thanks share the system, i'll try it next week. one question: macd above/below water line, but stoch already into overbought/oversold zone, do you still buy/sell?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
In my opinion, overbought/oversold is something that you have been told to believe in, but doesn't really exist.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
If you are trying to buy or sell into a trend, price is likely to stay over 80 or below 20 for long enough to make you some pips. I'm not that concerned about about ob and os areas, in fact I want it to be near there. In my opinion, stoch is great for entry but not so good for exit. Selling above 80 with a fast moving stoch like 5-3-3 is a great way to get creamed. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sure No problem! My third trade hit my stop at break even.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
thx for sharing ur system , i am goona try it next week. good luck

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Cannuck, Jeff, Glenn and all others, thanks for sharing this system, I'm very impressed so far and definitely would like to trade this but there's one problem: I don't use metatrader (and do not plan to do so) that's why I can't use the AS Indicator. I looked into the file by opening it with MS Word to see if I can "translate" it. But obviously I'm not very good in understanding MQL. So is there any possibility to get an explanation how this indicator works and maybe an easy language code? I know that it has been posted in other threads before but couldn't find details about it. Can anyone help? I want to code it for CMC , IT-Finance and Pro-Realtime Users. Hopefully my abilities in this language are not as limited as they are regarding MQL (but I can't promise anything) C U

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi joka, Go to http://www.metaquotes.net/ and download the free demo. Use it for charts and use your own broker for trading. Otherwise, not sure how to help you as far as writing code for a different platform. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hey WHTenn, I think we are on to something here for sure. I had no idea there would be the interest there seems to be. Thread had over 3000 views in a very short time. Thanks for the 5-star. Now let's all make some money. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks Cannuck. I guess thats the best and easiest way. Have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I shall try to get to the room after work, I think it is an excellent idea for a really good method. Reading back thru the thread, and looking at the chf/jpy loss that you incurred, I had an idea. Though I believe that losses are part and parcel of trading, I still believe that it should be possible to minimize the losses, or know when to take profits. obviously, the targets on gbp/jpy would not be the same as eur/usd in number of pips. I'd be happy with 10-12 pips on a 5M candle on the eur/usd anytime, but would really be aiming for 20-25 pips on the gbp/jpy etc For the coders amoungst us, wonder if it is possible to make an indicator, that lists the no. of pips of each 'x' number of candles. eg. last 5 candles were of pip size (basically difference between high and low) 20, 15, 25, 12, 18. Now, since we can see that the movements seem to be around the 16-20 pip mark, it can give us an idea/bias as to where/when to take profits, or atleast bring the trade to be. I have just chosen the numbers as random, hopefully I have managed to get my idea across. Regards, K.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
thanks reply.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
hi Kermut, You're basically describing volatility. There's already a common indicator for measuring this called the average true range and it's built-in to most charting packages including metatrader. I've used this indicator in other systems I've tested for determining stop losses and profit targets. An example for canuck's system might be something like: profit target = price +/- (1 x ATR) The idea being that in periods of greater volatility you go for more pips. Good luck with your trades!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Is there anyone here who is any good at coding? Please PM me. Thanks CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Here is an explanation of the market rythm indicator. If you detach the indicator from your chart and reattach it, you'll get the moving averages. Cheers CanuckCT http://www.fxtradeblog.com/rhythm.html

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I'm sure I could program at least the entry portion. Time-based EAs are not in my programming arsenal yet. Just a few questions. Which indicator must cross in the previous bar? What is the order of importance of your indicators? My understanding of your entry is the MACD must have crossed in the previous bar, and then the other indicators must be above a certain line, or above 50.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I'll e-mail you some information tomorrow regarding this. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Sold EU, was looking for price to go to 1.4500. Closed for +35. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thx for sharing your system CanuckCT, I like it I entered too that trade on EU but i'm adopting another method to handle the trade. Basically I enter 2 lots per single trade adjusting my risk size accordingly. I exit first lot whenever first indicator turns against my trade (usually it's stoch5), then remaining lot will continue to be in place until all indicators turns against my trade. So in this trade I already closed my first lot at 1.4501 because Stoch5 went above 50 for a +35 gain and I'm still short with second lot waiting when all indicators will turn for a long. Let's see how it goes

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Closed second lot at 1.4580 for a nice 57 pips profit. Combined total profit for this trade : 35+57 = 92 pips

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I saw some other site already mentioning X50, found it here by accident. Will check it out....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Nice trading. I'm liking the 2 lot entry as often the retrace is evidenced by only one of the indicators...usually the stoch. The second lot can be moved to BE and let it run. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks Canuck for sharing... Also thanks Skyline for the MM suggestion...

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thx Canuck Yes after first lot is closed we can move the sl to the be for the second lot that will be a free trade

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hello canuck i just saw your thread and am really pleased with its simplicity. It trully has great potential. I just joined the chat room u talked about and it would be nice to see fellow traders there discussing and posting their trades. thanks again. More +pips to u. One love.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Anyone ever trade this pair? Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I did this morning.... I had two small winners...+22 pips and +13 pips.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Quiet time to trade....looking for movement near the round numbers on GY. Looked like a re-entry point. Stoch had moved up and turned back down, MACD was still down, AS starting to move apart. Just looking for 10-15 pips. Entered at 205.89, exit at 205.73, +15.5 after spread 4 trades today + 83 pips. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Which pairs did you trade today? T4K

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Today traded EURUSD, AUDUSD, GBPJPY (3) - those seem to be the main 3 I watch when I can. I also like GBPCHF ( I see others are trading this too) and EURCHF, but I couldn't get to them during the day today. Those pairs seem to trend nicely intraday and were good today. I was in the middle of this post and went short on GJ again. Another retrace...stochs turns back down, macd below zero and AS moving apart. Closed for +40.3...total for day 123.5 However, as macdoug points out, just sell something. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I picked up +41 pips trading EUR/JPY in the early Asian session. I am very bearish on the carry trades atm due to the equity market meltdown. I was looking for any excuse to enter and x50 gave me a nice early entry on a quick move. I cant post a chart but I was in the trading room with with CanuckCT at time. He was on his GBP/JPY trade at the same time. Lots of fun!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Jumped in a little early due to nice stock formation and support from AS... Tight stop with intended small TP due to strong down trend.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Which trading room are you guys in and at what times?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Got home just in time to see the 14,3,3 crossing above 50, the 5,3,3 was already there, MACD going above zero and the AS crossing nicely. +20 easy pips. =)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Check post #38

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Nice trade and good line up of indies for the entry...well done.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks Oromis Not to throw a spanner in the works, but any good system needs to be able to not just pick up the good trades but filter out the "junk signals". Any ideas for the attached picture people?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Tenshi, The only comment I would like to make regarding the above chart... Always take note of price action immediately prior to the current price. Discretion is your filter...and this you will learn the more you trade. Where you have the vertical line, I would have jumped in two candles prior, but considering price before the consolidation seemed to be down, would have a tight stop and would grab whatever profits I could get. Also, remember your money management. You will always have losers, manager those losses and you will be profitable. This is a good system, and I like it a lot and most of those people trading it are doing pretty well. Good luck with your trading. Oromis.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks for the advice Oromis. I am just on the holy grail mission (doesn't exist) of finding the ultimate group of indicators. I know I will not get it (the holy grail) but the closer the better. The line on the picture is just the day separation line on my chart, not where I entered a trade. I know this system is good, I have benefited about 30 pips today using it. There is an excellent indicator made by ALEXISH in the pivot squeeze thread that helps to distinguish between ranging and trending modes. this is the link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=57426&amp;page=34 called: Bands_Squeeze_v5.mq4

--- 帖子 #88 ---
My first three trades using X50: GJ 205.80&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;206.11 206.64&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;206.78 EJ 153.39&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;153.25 Need to improve on exit....I am nervous on 5 minutes. Will be following this thread

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I'd like to check this out on higher TFs but when I do my indicators change!! Instead of MACD H4 and Stochs I get Spuds MTF stochs. It is probably my lack of knowledge of the MACD H4 indicator, but if someone can help to change time frames I will do some forward and back testing in higher TFs. thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Here is the template with the same view on all timeframes. I'll update post 1 as well as that is where the other indicators are located. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks CanuckCT Works fine now.

I'm working on an indicator to filter this stuff out. Film at 11 Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #93 ---
thanks for your hardwork! have u try trading 1min timeframe? hows your success percentage on the 5mins? thanks

--- 帖子 #94 ---
report back after you test that. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #95 ---
You don't always have to trade the macd cross. here macd was above zero, stochs had gone below 50 and turned back up to cross 50, as was in agreement. Entered for +12 with no heat. I'm looking at QQE but quite frankly wasn;t a factor on this trade. Interesting that it did cross right about where I entered. EDIT - I had no reason to exit this trade other than I had 10 to 15 pips in mind. It hit 15, retraced back to 12 and I hit the trigger. I left another 20 pips on the table. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I did not take this trade...not paying attention. My day job.... Here is my analysis those of how x50 would be traded. There are 3 vertical lines. The first line is where stoch crosses 50 and you have a heads up. Agressive traders would enter here because macd looks like it's turning and As looks like it will cross due to slope of red line. the second vertical line is the first bar of MACD cross, another entry point and the standard one...all conditions met per the first post. The third line is the first bullish candle after the setup. You could also enter here, it's a bit more conservative and price closed over 208...a round number. Three ways to play it as I see it.

Failed trade. I thought the setup on this one was good and was even up 8 pips at one time. Waited an extra bar on the entry...was waiting for AS to cross a bit more. If I had entered on macd cross, would have hit target. Didn't like price action. Closed for -2. Cheers CanuckCT

Hmmmmm. Maybe we could figure out a way to calculate the strength of the absolute strength indicator to filter out a few of these little bad ones. In other words filter out some or all of the weak trends.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I presume this to be 3 winners...59 pips? You nervousness may have something to do with thepairs youare trading. EURUSE, AUDUSD and EURCHF all fire off good trades and are less volatile. Just a thought. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #100 ---
If you look at the indicator is has 4 variables...the bull and bull signal lines and the bear and bear signal lines. The distances between the bull and bull signal line will be greater when the line has some slope to it and less when the line is flat. That's how you tell if it's flat and the distance (difference in the variable) is probably different for each pair. There's probably a filter in there somewhere... Cheers CanuckCT

My last post for today....I see 6 points of interest for EJ today. The first is after the news and the cross of MACD...that trade would have been a loser - I'll be discussing earlier entry on a setup like this one because it could have been a winner. The 2nd is a winner. The 3rd is re-entry based on stoch and is a winner. The 4th is re-entry based on stoch and is a winner. The 5th and 6th are crosses of MACD and are winners. All of the entries could have been made with little heat and close for 10-20 pips and trades # 3 and 5 for a lot more. Take the chart of your favorite pair and do the same thing. then you will start to trust the setups. I know it looks a bit different in real time...look for separation in AS for confirmation. Cheers CanuckCT

Any way of getting a pop up to notify the trader of when MACD crosses the 0 line? If I could code I would

Maybe if you smile nicely at Skyline he might write something for you. Great programmer.

Hey CanuckCT. I think this is a very good system. Been watching it from the beginning and testing it in demo mode. Being a newbie, I find it very easy to follow and like the results so far. Thank you for sharing it. I was wondering if the indicator that show up in your chart showing whether the rhythm is strong bull/bear, or weak bull/bear is an indicator, like part of the EJ Pivot. Maybe I am missing something. Your response on how I could get this on my charts would be greatly appreciated. Thank You

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Can someone tell me what was wrong with taking this one? Closed at -8 pips.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Nothing wrong as I can see. Remember sometime you win, sometime you lose

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I have same opinion with Skyline, you're doing right. I think you just unlucky coz enter when market in sideway. Thats one reason why i don't like use this method in some major pair, low range of movement. Compare it with GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
If you had taken the very next signal on that pair and stayed with it, you'd have made you 8 pips back and then some..........but I agree with the previous comments. You can't win every trade. Cheers CanuckCT

My view from looking at the chart would be the following: Candles :are showing signs of a small resistance area... MACD: Is coming up from a shallow position so possible stall ( or zero bounce) due to lack of momentum... Stoch: is on or above 78.4%....therefore showing possible turn or weakness in momentum.. Absolute Strength: Blue solid line starting to curve and dotted line breaking out to high from the turn up... and blue line did not return completely to the bottom of the window, showing a partial bounce there again showing low volume..to complete the move and showing a great posibility that it will stall.. Just my thoughts... Glenn

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Two charts to look at...both very profitable trades. Entry on GC was early. More on that later. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #113 ---
The other thing about this chart is the 14-3-3 stoch. Primarily it's the 5-3-3 that leads the way and the 14-3-3 follows. If you look at this chart...the 14-3-3 is a bit flat and somewhat directionless. I know sometimes it looks different in real time. But the best entries have 5-3-3 and 14-3-3 moving together and at least pinted up and above 50...still -8 is not a bad trade as long as you jumped on the next signal as it was a good one. It you sit for long and overanalyze the loser, you miss the next good one. It's M5 and things do happen in 5 minute intervals. Cheers CanuckCT

[quote] CanuckCT EC and GC Two charts to look at...both very profitable trades. Entry on GC was early. More on that later. Cheers CanuckCT Hi Ben I dont trade either of these pairs.....but just looking at the AS indicator on these charts I would say theres a nice short move in about 10 to 15 mins. both stochs are overbought as well. Glenn

--- 帖子 #115 ---
The only thing I have to add is that I never take a trade heading into ""00" or ".50" as these are generally strong resisance areas. ".20" and ".80" are also SR areas. This trade was right at the .50 mark. If you look back you can see that it was consistently a SR area.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Glenn, Not seeing those shorts. MACD never crossed zero line and the stoch and macd have to be in place before I look at AS indicator. The stoch crossing 50 is important only when MACD cross zero within the next bar or two, that's how I view it. One other item...was talking with a fellow trader who was not having success. Was getting stopped out and in his case stops were too tight as 3 out of 4 trades would have been winners had his stops been wider. I regularly have 20-30 pips of heat on GY or GC and 20 pips on AU or EU or EC. That's reality. If your stops are tighter than that, you'll probably going to have problems. I'm waiting for candles close to make decisions on a trade and will only jump early if it's real obvious that the trade setup is going to be in play. If MACD crosses back on the next candle, then you probably entered too soon and need to be wary. Part of the system is the crossing of MACD, so when it crosses back immediately, you may lose. The other thing, if you have a losing trade, and everyone does, that's not the time to jump to another pair. If you jump to another pair and that trade is a loser and then you jump to another pair and that trade is a loser...you get the idea, then it's not the system that is not working. Often if you had stuck with the same pair you would have been ok. The other night in the chat room was a prime example. We had a couple of losing trades in the room. The setups were good, but the trades didn't work and it was probably due to the time of thenight. So we signed off. About 20 minutes later, I was still waiting for something to happen, there was a huge short that everyone would have easily recovered the losses we had sustained in the room. I caught it and probably others did too. I focus on 4 or 5 pairs only, watch more than that, and if I have a loser on one pair then I'm looking for the next trade on that pair. If markets are ranging on M5 then you are going to get creamed. And it does happen. I too am looking for some guidelines for this for my own trading. If a 20 or 30 pip loss is more than you can stand, then your money management needs some work and you need to trade smaller lots. That will keep you in the game for when you catch that runner. The other thing, if you are up 8 to 10 pips and then the trade goes against you, it's not a losing setup, the problem was you didn't take profits quickly enough. You can't catch a runner on every trade. Not going to happen. I could post just losing trades but what's the point to that. I'm winning 3 out of 4 trades with this method and it's all I trade. And I'm only taking 4 to 5 trades per day as time permits. Looking back today there seems to be several winners during the morning NY session...but there were losing trades also. If you had stuck with a pair you'd have been ok and looked for re-entry signals. This post is not intended as a rant in any way, and especially not at you Glenn, just trying to fit it all into one post. I do encourage folks to post some of their losing trades as that can generate some discussion if you want. I'll rather be lookin at the good setups so I can pick them out than to focus on losing trades. We should be focusing on money management for handling the losing trades. I don't mean to be harsh in my comments, but if the system's not working for you, you need to keep looking. My 2 cents. Cheers CanuckCT [quote=glenn5t;1816966]

Hi CanuckCT, I was in your trading room this morning and someone had mentioned perhaps using a different one where you can share charts live and post charts also. Tradingrooms.com is such a site that allows this and is also more user friendly. Just a suggestion. Thanks for starting this thread. System seems to work well.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi thank you CanuckCT for sharing your system. could you please tell me clearly about Stop Loss in your trades

--- 帖子 #119 ---
See post#116 paragraph 2. T4K

--- 帖子 #120 ---
You might try looking at ATR 5 and see what the range for the previous 5 candles is and use that for your stop. I have a default stop in Oanda for all trades at 30 pips but my mental stopis lower, around 20, for some pairs.. Sometimes I take it out for GY if I believe in the trade and think it's a pullback, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I'm stopped only to see the trade go my way. Sometime I exit well before stop is hit. I guess I'm all over the place so not very good for advice on this matter. But 20 to 30 is where I am and I give the trade time to work. it's really quite satisfying to take 15 to 20 pips of heat and then see the trade go your way. When you are -15 and the 5-3-3 stoch is turning in your favour, that's a good sign to stick with it. Lots of ways to deal with stops and I'd really like to hear what others are doing it. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi k2kv, Can you also post a live chart and follow it for all to see, or is it just only a captured image you can catch and post? I made that recommendation only because you can do that at trading rooms and didn't think you could in the current room. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
As far as I know, you can only post captured images, not live charts, in the current room.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks k2.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
CanuckCT, Thanks for the great system. Can you clarify something? For a good setup does the MACD need to cross zero within two bars of only the 5,3,3 stochs crossing 50 OR both the 5,3,3 and 14,3,3 crossing 50 line?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
This is a neat idea...posting a live chart in a room and following it. How do you do this. I couldn't even find where to set up a room, let alone post a live chart. I'll have to check that out again. I do like it better than what we now have. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #128 ---
My idea of a good setup is macd had crossed zero and 5-3-3 has crossed 50, with 14-3-3 also heading up...is doesn't need to be over 50 but if it's following the 5-3-3 it will be by the time AS confirms. The tighter the 5-3-3 and 14-3-3 are, the better. Within a couple (1 to 3), the signal should be confirmed. I'm trying to clarify this a bit more, but as you know, it's not an exact science. But it is just numbers that you relate to each other and I'm working on that for an indicator. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Here are 3 trades that I just made as follows: Macd below zero so predominent trend is down trade 1 5-3-3 stoch went above 50 and crossed back down...was good separation on as so sold for +10 pips trade 2 same...5-3-3 stoch went above 50 and turned back down...was good separation on as so sold for +28 trade 3 this time 5-3-3 went all the way to 80 which was the 208 round number and turned. Once it cleared 85 sold and closed for +22. This trade was a bit tricky because AS had crossed. However stochs and macd in agreement and as never really separated much before it cross back. Was only looking for 15 or 20 pips...down to 208.50. When playing the cross of stoch like this not waiting for candle close...just waiting for the cross. That's 5 trades today included EURCHF and GBPCHF from this morning.... Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Sold AUDUSD @0.8728 . Was it good setup?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Setup looked fine to me... Canuck has mentioned that waiting for the second bar on the MACD is often a good idea. If u entered on the close of the bear candle, the very next candle went enough against you to move the MACD back above zero, I would have got out of that trade for around -10, and waited for the next setup. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello neshat, The only comment I'll make is that for ideal setups the AS indicator should cross and be pointed in the opposite direction...the steeper the angle the better and both the blue and red lines should have crossed their respective signal lines. Not sure what this would have looked like live...probably looked great, judging by the 4 bearish candles. But looking at it now, it seems like the AS indicator lines still quite close even though they have crossed. Better luck on the next one. BTW, the signal before this one and the next 3 signals (see blue lines on image) would have have netted positive pips if you had taken on the macd cross and AS cross, exactly what you did here. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Just my thoughts on this trading system so far. I opened a demo account a couple days ago and I have exclusively traded using this method. It seems as though every account I have entered into has been positive at one point in time. Granted I am totally new to forex, just started reading on it like 2 months ago so I don't know a whole lot. Of the 26 trades I have entered into, only two I have closed for a negative gain. The other 24 have either been breakeven or positive. I need to work more on an exit strategy. I was up almost $3,000 on a trade this morning and tried to let it ride out until the indicators all turned against me, and ended up settling for like a $500 profit. I'm sure I would not be trading this aggressively if this was my own money, but I had turned a $1,000 deposit into almost $6,000 in 3 days time. I also work full time so I am sure I have missed a few other trades. Anyways, just wanted to give my two cents on the system. I hope everyone else is experiencing good returns using this system. Thanks again CanuckCT, I feel this system has promise!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi cfossy04, Great to hear. Seems like you need to be taking profits more quickly and to start to practice money management like trying to risk certain % of your account on each trade. Most trades I have entered have been positive and most are closing for positive pips. I'm working on exit strategies. More on that later, but usually a good idea to take profits before all indicators turn against you. I'm attaching a money management calculator and pip log that's i've been using. I'llprobably be adding a sheet for actual trade details and an equity curve chart and will share when available. Can you share how you deciding which trades to enter? I'm a few weeks away from have indicator and EA to help with trade selections so I can trade several pairs at once. Tons of great signals every day regardless of the bigger trend. In fact, ranging markets are great trending markets on M5. The other thing I'm exploring is watching the M5 entry for initial entry and then glancing at H1. If entry on M5 correspond to an entry on H1, the moves seem to be great. So, as most systems go, when you have agreement over more than one timeframe, the trade has a much greater chance of success. Food for thought. Many ways to trade x50. Cheers CanuckCT

Oromis Member Oromis and I were in a new room at www.tradingrooms.com last night. Much better setup for trading as we shared a live chart from my computer to his. Very, very cool. Thanks to grkbear for the suggestion. Watching a live chart together and talking thru a trade was most helpful to me and I think oromis got something from it as well. I called a trade on GY that was closed for +35. Neither of us took the trade...more of a here's how I do it session...when and why to enter and when and why to exit. The room is called x50 under the community rooms. Drop by if you have a chance...trading can be lonely at times. I don't think we should be calling out trades per se, but just have it as a meeting place to chat. Cheers CanuckCT

Hi nea, that sounds really nice, is it possible that you could also make an indicator for it? If trading many pairs it is difficult to track all set-ups, so an alert and/or email function would be awsome Happy trading, PC

NOTICE: Due to some type of bug with the Absolute Strength BACKTESTING will not work!!!!!!!! The AO works fine under normal operation (forward testing). I'm going ahead and posting the x50 EA - I have tested it since last night and seems to be working properly. Kind of hard to test when BACKTESTING doesn't work. Results: 2008.01.24 22:55 buy 1.00 gbpjpy 211.38 211.74 +36 pips 2008.01.25 01:45 buy 1.00 gbpjpy 211.90 211.60 -30 pips 2008.01.25 03:35 buy 1.00 gbpjpy 211.98 212.68 +70 pips 2008.01.25 15:00 buy 1.00 gbpjpy 213.19 213.39 +20 pips Conditions the EA follows: BUY Stoch BULL and BEAR must be over 55 Stoch BULL must be over the Stoch BEAR line MCAD must be greater than 2.0 AO BULL must be greater than AO BEAR SELL Stoch BULL and BEAR must be under 45 Stoch BULL must be under the Stoch BEAR line MCAD must be less than -2.0 AO BULL must be less than AO BEAR Things I will probabbly add will be START TIME and STOP TIME for trading so it can be set to start in the London Session and stop later in the New York Session. I think the times it gets into the most trouble is the low volume trading times when the conditions for a trade might be met, but there's just not enough momentem or strength in the market to keep on going. SETTINGS MagicNumber = 3043231; // just make sure this is different than you may have for another EA StopLoss=30; Stop2BE=30; // if price moves up X pips - move SL to break even TakeProfit=100; TrailStop=20; Lots=0.1; MoneyManagement=false; // MoneyManagement on/off based on account balance Risk=3; // percent of risk Any other coders, feel free to make modifications to the EA, just please change the version number so people will know it is different. (attached are aslo the indicators it uses - you may already have them)

nealc99, Hey that looks good! Here is an old file from MT3 that might help. It is as substitute for AWE. You can change the shift and the periods to roll your own oscillator. This one is pretty close to AWE. I am also sending a screen shot of my setup of "key to the mint" on a shorter time frame. Some of the indicators used there are pretty powerful. Will test your EA, and help any way I can. Regards, Charles (Rydnek)

Another sucessful EA trade: 2008.01.25 21:20 buy gbpjpy 211.65 211.77 = +12pips Maybe starting Tuesday I'll have to list the previous days EA trades so we can keep track of things. So far that's 4 out of 5 winners for a total of +108 pips for the past 24 hours! Perhaps filtering out the slow periods (non London/New York sessions) will weed out the less likley to succeed trades. Neal

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Neal, I made a couple of corrections. I used "Orders Total() &lt;1" on Line 45 and changed your code on Line 47 col 69 to show MAIN rather than SIGNAL (which may not be what you intended). I could not get the EA to run without the first correction. Charles

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thanks for your assistance.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Neal, I looked at your EA (thanks for your work, BTW) and I couldn't find any reference to the Awesome Oscillator anywhere.. perhaps you meant to say there's a problem with the Absolute Strength indicator? If that's the case, the problem may be the way you called the indicator: Inserted Code double asbull=iCustom(NULL, 5, "AbsoluteStrength_v1.1july 30..1", 0,10,5,5,0,3,0,0, false, 0,1); I believe that the 'false' parameter is extraneous and should be removed. @ rydnek: Your first mod has the side effect of making the EA count all open trades, even if they were made by a different EA or by manual entry. If this EA is the only source of open trades it should cause no problems.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thanks DGC for catching those items. 1) It was the Absolute Strength that has some type of bug and NOT the Awesome Ocillator. 2) The FALSE should not have been there (but didn't help the backtesting problem) ATTACHED: The most recient version 1.02 of the x50 EA (just minor bug fixes)

--- 帖子 #149 ---
When calling on an indicator which is not included as a standard indicator with metatrader, it needs to be placed in the "Indicators" folder. I had the same problem when I was coding my own version of an EA for canuckCT

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Why can you only forward test and not backtest...please explain. Thanks Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Ronald - keep on working on the EA - your may work better than mine or else you might canablize mine to make a better one Neal

--- 帖子 #152 ---
For some reason the AbsoluteStrength_v1.1july 30..1 indicator is not properly returning values to the EA. It may just be a setting in my iCustom() statement. All the other indicators are returning valid values.

For backtesting???? Do you get any SELLs or just all buys? The number being fed to the EA is in the form of 0.0001 to 0.0003 (which is incorrect) and NO negative numbers are being returned (which would be an indication of a SELL - in conjunction with other indicators).

Regarding the Sell Order issue, double check this section of logic in your EA: Original: Inserted Code if((stochbull &lt; 45 &amp;&amp; stochbear &gt; 45)&amp;&amp; stochbear &lt; stochbull){ if(mcad4hr &lt; 2){ if(asbull &lt; asbear) { sw=-1; } } } Changing program logic (stochbear &lt;45) triggers sell orders during backtesting: Inserted Code if((stochbull &lt; 45 &amp;&amp; stochbear &lt; 45)&amp;&amp; stochbear &lt; stochbull){ if(mcad4hr &lt; 2){ if(asbull &lt; asbear) { sw=-1; } } }

Yes Jam that was the problem - thanks for the assistance! Will post a corrected version shortley. Neal

--- 帖子 #158 ---
CHANGES/ADDTIONS: More bug fixes StartHr=6 Only trading after this setting (0 would be 00:00 according to your servers time zone) TradeWithTrend=true Will only take trades in the direction of the last 15 minutes trend BACKTESTING is now working The default settings (Stop Loss, Take Profit, etc) probabbly need some adjustments - did the best I could They are based on GBPJPY so if you are doing EURUSD or another pair you will want to adjust the numbers accordingly.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Ronald, I encourage you to complete your EA as you have a lot of nice features and there is a good chance yours can outperform the one I did which will benifit us all Look forward to testing once you've completed it. Perhaps us a little different naming strategy so they can tell yours from mine somehow. Good luck! Neal

I'm looking for 5 people to help with some very specific testing on an EA for x50. I have one volunteer already, so I need 4 others. Please PM me for details. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I am working on an x50 Indicator Alert but need the market to be open to properly test. This will produce an ALERT box/sound when all the indicators have properly lined up. At that point a trader can examine the chart and make a decision on wheither to enter the trade.

--- 帖子 #162 ---

I've put the indicator in the experts/indicators folder. When calling on the indicator, nothing happens. Any suggestion?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I have the same response (nothing)

The name of the indicator in the iCustom function must be exactly the same as the indicator in the folder. The following examples are ALL DIFFERENT in the eyes of the iCustom function. Custom . custom. custom . CUSTOM. Also, did you compile the indicators?

The x50 indicator is currently under construction and will be in testing over the next few weeks. Here's a screenshot from today. Film at 11. The sell was from one of the signals...in a demo account. Trade opened but not closed. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Canuck, I see the x50 indicator is under construction. Pardon my "newbiness" but does this mean I can't use the one you provided before or are you just refining it? I have just started to use it and one trade that netted me 15 pips. I like to trade longer term, but this is great if you want to sit down for a few hours and trade shorter TFs. I really like the concept. Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Great CanuckCT, looking forward to it

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi deang The templates work fine....but the indicator processes MACD, stochastic and AS values and creates the arrows you see in my post along with a popup alert. You don't need it to trade this method...but the alert is helpful for pulling the trigger and watching multiple pairs. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hey Canuck, I used your method last night and went very well. 100 odd pips from 4 separate trades. All winners! I really like this method because 1, it seems to work, and 2, if you have a few hours you can just get in there and do it for a while without having to worry about leaving the trades going over night. I would like to try to adapt the settings to another two platforms I use, IG Markets and Halifax but I'm not sure if they have the AI. It would be interesting to see how they preform with the indexes, gold and oil etc. It would also be interesting to see how they go with high volume equities as well. I have used Spuds stochs with equities, indexes and gold etc with success, especially gold but using 30m time frames. Cheers, Dean

Hello CanuckCT, if i tell u i know how to praise your great effort it would have been an understatement.cuz this is the best system have ever.With Consistence one can make millions.Kodus to your great work.. Ayour2a more,does it mean that the AS must always be in the opposite direction with the Stoch?get back to me asap.thanks

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi guys, I thought I might post some of my trades in an effort to get some feedback and make myself a better trader. The green lines and the red dotted lines are my entry and exit. I think I satisfied all the entry criteria and closed for 19 pips which I thought was ok. I left a lot on the table though, even more as we speak it seems! Was the sign that the AI lines were still separating an indication that I should of stayed in for longer? I think I exited the trade because it looked like it was going to go up again from the tail. Could you please tell me if my entry was ok and what I should have looked for to stay in the trade or longer. I've only been trading for a short while and Spuds original theory was the first system I have ever used. Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi deang, I think you entry was great...re the exits, spud often thought that once the stoch hit oversold you would grab your pips and run. What we are trying to do is catch a trend and ride it a bit longer. Althought the 5-3-3 made a bit of a turn and 14-3-3 did not and that is a good sign the it's a pullback for a breath before continuing down. My 2 cents. You might have considered moving you stop to BE at 20 and then let it ride a bit. Where you exited was still looking quite bearish. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Cheers for that. I have been following other people's trades at a lot of the entries don't seem to strictly adhere to the rules but more based on personal intuition. I'm trying to stick to the rules of entry for now. One thing I'm a bit confused regarding the entry is the MACD. When you see that first bar cross zero, do you enter then or wait for the candle to finish? If you enter straight away do you jump out of the trade if it turns back? I'll post a few more trades when they come if that's ok. I have read all of Spuds original thread a few times and the art of trading MTF stochs as well. Do you suggest any more important threads that will further my knowledge of your method and the indicators used? Also, what exactly are you doing with the X50 indicator atm? I had trouble understanding what it was you were up to? Thanks Dean

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi, what are arrows on your chart? thx

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I must say that as a true scalping method this approach is very consistent. Well done!!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi deang001 FWIW I took exactly the same trade you described in #177 - exited for the reason you did, and then watched as more and more pips developed. Not complaining though. My thanks to Canuck for developing this excellent strategy, which I use for the first 2/3 hours of the Europe/London open with considerable sucess. Now, if only we could find the perfect exit............that to me is the Holy Grail!!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hello folks, Real busy time for me at work...so I won't be posting much for a while but will be quietly trading. However, I have been up late at nights searching for a way to improve this approach. And here it is. I've been quietly searching for a trend identification filter and x50 is now new and improved. The filter is called UT_Fast and it appears on the bottom of the chart. You can trade x50 as is or with this new approach. It takes a little longer to get into the trade, but wins more often and keeps you out of ranging markets. Isn't that what we all want. I'm trading this on 5-3-3 and 14-3-3 stochs and the trend filter. MACD is gone because is it redundant. UT_Fast identifies the trend and stochs for entry. Only enter in direction of trend. Comments? Can someone build this into an EA? The folks who are testing the indicator...please put this on hold for now. On the chart of GJ for today...all winners and if you must enter on a bullish candle for a buy and a bearish for a sell, the last trade would not have been taken. Thanks CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi CanuckCT, Am I correct in assuming that when green is above red on the UT_Fast that we're in an up trend and that the opposite is true for downtrend? Also, of what significance are the level lines on that indicator? Thanks is advance and it's looking good!

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Have you done away with the AI as well?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
how do you use sto 14 3 3 and 5 3 3 to entry in new method? in crossing? thanks

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I THINK? I understand your new indicator and how it works but not really 100%. Canuck, could you please give an explanation of how the UT operat es and how you specifically use it. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
You'll find some info on this indicator over on www.forex-tsd.com . I wish I could supply the exact link but I've yet to find out how to do that on FF! Maybe some kind soul could clue me in. I asked the admin. ages ago, but no reply as yet. Cheers

Hi psymantis, That is correct. I believe above 23 and below 8 is the level for a strong trend reading (though I'm not sure that's how I will use it). Because x50 provides a lot of signals, the EA under construction is hyper-active. We are tinkering with using this as a filter to reduce the number of trades that it takes. Entry rules are as per post #1, except that it only takes the trades as per this filter. Think of it as providing the EA with a little discretion. Some people trade the cross of this filter and I think it's a pretty good indicator to help identify sideways markets that you might want to avoid. I'm still testing, but it seems like it will have some merit. Original x50 still intact but the idea is to use an indicator for the alert that conditions exist and then glance at the trend...and make a decision. I will share indicator when it's ready, still a few issues to sort out. See chart below...all of x50 rules met....macd crossed zero, both stochs toght together and below 50 and AS confirms. But as might be expected on Sunday night the markets ranging and this trade is a pass. Sometimes GBPCHF trades quite nicely in the Asian session and would want to take those trades. As with any indicator, when the trend is changing they lag a bit so following these rules you will miss some trades. But there is always opportunity for re-entry later and you could of course ignore the trend filter all together. Cheers, CanuckCT

Here is an example of how the filter would be sucessful in an EA. It would filter a bunch of trades and accept the trades that fire once a trend sets in. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi All, I have been live trading the X50 method for 10 days now and I wanted to share my experience. As Canuck mentioned already the X50 is really “reactive”. i.e. you get a lot of signals. However a high percentage is fake signals. Version 2 of the method seems to add an indicator to avoid false setups. I’m personally doing 2 thinks to filter out signals. First I added an EMA 60. Rule are, Take long trade only when price is above EMA Take short trade only when price is below EMA Second I added the “wave”. It comes from Raghee Horner's book. The wave is basically 3 EMA 34, on the close, high and low. Avoid entering a trade when price is in the wave and/or wave is flat. Give it a try and may be people developing the indicator and EA could benefit from these. Good trading to all of you. Dids

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi CanuckCT, Following the rules, doesn't the entry for the Long trade you marked in red should have been taken 3 candles earlier? All the rules including the new UT were met. Am I right ? BR Dani M

--- 帖子 #196 ---
yes - you are correct. The line should be on the other side of the blue arrow. CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Dids, I would like to learn more about the tweaks you are using with the X50 system. Would you be able to share the "wave" indicator that you added to your chart or point me in the direction where I could obtain it. Thanks, Chris

--- 帖子 #198 ---
All you do is go to your indicators list, select moving average, set period to 34, set method to exponential, then set the apply to paramater to close. Repeat that same process two more times only set the apply to paramater to high on one and low on the other. Hope this makes sense! Please correct me if I'm wrong Dids.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi orientos I always look back to london open and drool at the setups. That seems to be the best time to trade x50...but that can be said for a lot of systems. You might try this for your exit. Add a 4EMA to your chart with a +10 and -10 for the levels. Use that to move your stop. For a sell, the upper level of channel is used, for a buy the lower level of the channel is used. It seems to be close to a 30 pip trailing stop. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I notice that if on macd cross, by the second bar, the value is 3.0 or preferably 3.5, and the Bulls/Bear ratio on the absolute strength indicator is 2:1, then this is likely to be a good move. has anyone else observed that. If so, could keep us out of bad moves. thanks Pardy

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Chris, I don’t think a “wave” indicator as such exists. The best is to add 3 EMAs 34 on your chart. The wave can be used different ways. 1)It gives instructions on the trend, Up or Down. 2)It can prevent trading in ranging markets, i.e. when the price is between the top and bottom EMAs. 3)The Wave can also be used as a “Breakthrough” indicator. When the wave is broken, e.g. the price closing above the top EMA can be a BUY signal. Last but not least I used the Wave as a “strength” indicator. You should see it as a clock. The angle can be used as with your watch. The time can be 1, 2…up to 5 o’clock. I like to buy when my “wave” clock is showing 1 or 2 o’clock and sell when the time is 4 or 5 o’clock. I hope all this make sense and don’t hesitate to contact me shall you require more information. Cheers, Dids

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks Dids and CanuckCT. Dids, is the book worth buying?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Tenshi, I would tend to say yes but I don’t know what you are looking for and your knowledge level. It’s a good book well written and not too technical. It covers many areas of trading, chart, psychology, money mgt etc. Drawback is that each area could be covered individually in many books. What I liked the most is that the book tries to present trading from a-z. It is a system that will take the reader by hand and present Raghee’s methodology. After reading it you could jump right away into trading ;-). If you speak French I know another book with does the same but for Futures (concept could be applied to FX as well) which is the best book I know like this. Hope it helps. Dids

Dear all, I've been trading for 3 years and I've been following ff since that time. I've had terrible success but I follow important threads like this one. I follow forex with great passion and would like to have an EA trade for me as well so I've attached an image along with the indicators to help you all out. You can use the following filters to time your trades. trades. A signal generator to monitor the trades so you don't have to monitor your computer all the time.. It's an EMA Cross 4 8 alert signal. The madro golden filter, ... well, it confirms the signal above.. I'm not sure what the indicators are... but it confirms the trade. The slope detection line will put you on the right side of the trade.. Mind you the higher the time frame, the greater the accuracy.. but it will allow you to enter the trades with tight stops. A Gann Hi Lo Filter.. again putting you on the right side of the trade.

Here is the revised template I'm using to trade. Also, place TomDemark Trendlines on your 1 hour/4 hour/Daily charts to determine market support and resistance. Price will bounce or break these lines to invite new triggers to support your trade. I believe if you combine all these you will trade better. I look forward to helping you all and trading together.

M5

--- 帖子 #209 ---
thanks for your reply. M5 i guess it is refering to 5minute trade. So for 5minute meaning every 5 minute we need to observed for the signal?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes M5 is a 5 minute time frame. Everything you need know about this system is explained very well by CanuckCT in post #1. T4K

--- 帖子 #211 ---
can someone advised about the sentence above?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
If above 50 looking to buy, below 50 looking to sell. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Use the 4H TD trendlines for your support and resistance and pay attention on the 5 min chart for breaks or bounce. Becareful about getting chop out, because bears and bulls are fighting for positioning.

Hey Canuck, I have a MT4 platform from MBC that has a gold and oil feed. I think the X50 will work well with these two instruments as tehy trend very strongly. I have an adapted X50 on my other platform which I picked up 208 pips on oil on Friday night but I will be looking forward to using the real thing next week. I have tried to post images here of the x50 with gold and oil but the sytem wont let me post attachments for some reason?? Cheers, Dean

Hi Deang001, Those are nice charts for sure. I wanted to give those folks who are trading x50 a heads up...x50 indicator should be ready in a day or two. I'm not including the UT_Fast indicator filter as it was going to consume too many resources. It will have a minimum MACD cross, a moving average filter and a popup alert. Cheers CanuckCT

Should have indicator ready for tomorrow or Thursday. Here is a shot of x50 using an 89EMA as a filter. Must be above it for a buy and beloe it for a sell. I took the last trade on this chart. Cheers, CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Looks good Canuck. I found my most successful trades on the X50 so far have been when paying particular attention to the slope of the AI and how quickly they are pulling away from each other. In demo mode I have been trying this out and jumping into quick trades even when the MACD has not crossed 0 and done well. Your method really suits me down to the ground as I only have limited time when I'm able to trade. The longer term entries really only avail themselves periodically when the stars align and you can jump on a powerful trend and ride it. Your method however, lets you sit down for a few hours and hopefully catch a few moves and then wrap it up for the day. Perfect. The aspect of the X50 I like the best is that you can have 12 crosses + oil and silver in my case, and just focus on the MACD crossing 0 and then zoom in for a closer look if it looks ok. Gives you lots of opportunities. The image I have attached is what I usually have on my screen at the same time and thats on a 13.3" MacBook! Looking forward to the new X50. Cheers, Dean

Hmm... wonder where CanuckCT got the idea of an 89EMA filter (grin). Also you might tell them about the colored squares and what they mean as well as post the indicator that produces them. Keep up the good work! Neal

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi neal, I've been tinkering with 60EMA, 89EMA and 200EMA for filters. But I believe the 89EMA is working the best and it is what you are using. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Looking forward to the x-50 indicator. The large colored squares looks like a session indicator -- i-sessions or paramount or one of the others?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
89 is a Fib level so it should serve you well.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
It's a different session indicator, but I think they all do the same thing...for now i shade London and NY but what I'm thinking it will be used for is to shade the times to trade for a pair, so each pair has it's own template....might be an hour before London until noon in NY and it might be different for some pairs. Some will use a different moving average, etc. Film at 11. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hei... first of all, i would like to thank canuck for the system. it is really great to see green pip for each trade. and thank you to all members who had contributed so much in making the system better. but, maybe some of you can share with me on when are we going to close the trade? by looking at the indicator? any specific method? or by counting the pips? anyway, thanx everyone and thanx again to canuck. You are a great man. one more thing, how do we read the UT fast indicator? i don't realr understand its function. what i do know is that when the green is up, then, it is an uptrend. good for buy and vice versa. Can someone please explain it in detail for me on how to read it? thank you,

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hey Canuck, how's the new indicator coming along? Some questions if I may. Are the MACD indicator you use &amp; the Absolute strength indicator able to be used on any time frame? I can't seem to find much info on the ASI itself. Are there any threads on it? I tried the search function but it only shows me the first page out of 67 for some reason. The other search with it in the title shows nothing. Is this an indicator that Glenn5t has put together? Also, is this the thread that outlines the H4 MACD you use http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=14630 Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Hello folks. Sorry I haven't been very active on this thread. I'm a tax accountant and real busy right now. So I won't be posting much for a while. Here is version 1 of the x50 indicator. The attached PDF explains most of the settings and it has a lot of flexibility. Some will say there is too much going on and they may be right. My longer term goal is to create an EA and in fact there is an EA that will read the indicator and do the trades. But you need to get into the code and compile an indicator specifically for each pair and the EA reads the indicator settings...so it's a bit clumsy. By releasing it, I'll only create more questions than I can handle, so it's on the shelf for now. However, if you do find some settings that really seem to work well, post it and I'll compile the indicator/EA for that pair and you can test it. The EA for the default settings it too active to be of any value. Basically the indicator uses the default settings on post 1. There are other features as follows: - Can change macd, stoch and Absolute Strength settings - Has a minimum MACD cross (uses the Metatrader MACD...so add that to your chart for clarity of what exactly the MACD numbers are as they differ for many pairs...some are 0.03 while others will be 0.0003) - Can use a moving average filter - Has a simple and advanced entry (advanced entry uses cross of fast ctosh over 50 and back for re-entry in the direction of the prevailing trend. - It works on all timeframes I'll leave it at that for now. Any questions, I'll try to get back to you. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi canuckCT Thanks for your latest posting, with template,etc. I'll play around with the indicator over the next few days. But in the meantime, picked up a handy 33 pips on Eur/Jpy early in the London session, thanks to you. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Thanks CanuckCT for all your hard work. I got through January on the 15min chart for GJ and it seems to give good entries. I love how price seems to bounce off the 100SMA. I also include the 89EMA for resistance and then the 21EMA and 10EMA for good entries (see Phillip Nels thread). It all seems to be about determining the immediate trend and then getting a good entry.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
CanukCT, I just started Forex about 3 weeks ago, the first thing I found was your thread. I've successfully made over 3 thousand dollars with an initial deposit of 600. With a good ammount of luck, and your system I've really found something I can do everyday, the 50X system is great for daytrading inbetween my classes and late at night during homework. I was wondering if you would please release the m4q soon so that I could possibly write an addition for sound notification (i miss alot of trades due to being minimized), and to run some backtesting. Thanks so much for this system and cheers to you!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hello Folks, I was testing the new Indicator and notice some "weird" arrow? I had a look at the settings but I am not sure I really understand the meaning of the following settings, X_Value_1 = 0; //Bears - Bulls &gt;= X, where X is the value you set for that pair What is Bears-Bulls? ConfirmationMACDBars_1 = 0; //MACD signal &gt; X (default is 0) with option for confirmation of two or 3 bars Is this the number of bar above a certain value (0 I guess) we need to have to get a signal? MinimunMACDValue = 0; What is this minimum value compared to X_Value_1? MA_Filter_ma_method = MODE_EMA Do we need text or an integer here ? MA_Filter_ma_applied_price = PRICE_CLOSE; Do we need text or an integer here ? Last two must be a MetaTrader question I guess. I would be very grateful if somebody could shed some light on this. Thanks in advance, Dids

Hi, I can't seem to attach the EA to my charts for some reason its in my expert directory ... !! Thanks, Goodbadmas

I'll address these questions later this evening. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #238 ---
CanukCT, I've found an error in the EA, it seems the motion for buy comes almost 1 to 2 candles too late based on your system. Once again I'm hoping you post the mq4 file sometime soon so we can all help improve on this amazing system. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Goodbadmas I think you will find that x50-I(ver1.0) is an indicator, not an EA. At least that's the way I am using it, ie, in the Indicators file, not the Experts file.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
oh .. i m sorry i thought i was a EA my bad thanks, Goodbadmas

Been watching this thread for a bit. I have also been using the original template and watching price. Last night took my first trade sold GBPCHF and made 23 pips. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Has anyone gone live with this? I want to know what the x50 is like with a broker. On the demo I can pull hundreds in on the hour, I'm going to go live after I break my demo goal.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi demundus Yes, I trade it live - have done so for some time now. I only trade for 2 hours or so when Europe opens and there are no broker problems. Can't imagine why there should be. It's a great strategy, thanks to CanuckCT But I can't make hundreds of pips. How do you do that? Regards.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello demundus, Attached is the mq4 file. I also noticed the signal was coming a bit late. If you can fix this, would be great. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Well I love trading stocks, and Forex is new to me, I'm a big news guy and big on common sense. Lately, the EURUSD is on an inflation high, and inversely the USDJPY is on the short. I usually never trade these pairs but they are very volatile, even during dead hours. Some of this i will admit is luck, however I've long'd EURUSD before I go to sleep every night for the past 4 nights to gain about 400ish pips. This morning I lost 35 doing it, so I'm done with that for now, When I wake up, I short the USDJPY for a few hours and ride the fall on the closing bell. I'll have to find a new trend soon though, the dollar is starting to hold now due to Ambac, etc; Just grab some news, trust this EA, and dive in!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
To elaborate, Basically I stay up till absurd hours doing homework or whatever, basically PST except I live on the east coast, thats how my schedule works. So I can sort of monitor the Asian session for a little bit and see which way it probably will go, I obviously don't dive in head first but there is a whole lot of risk considering forex can go any way at any time with no warning. I took some screenshots of the past few days on the 30M graph, this isn't how I usually trade, it's just to show you the trend (and my luck).

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Sorry to triple post, but, it seems that the code for the mq4 is written in spanish?? I'll do what I can to pick out the fix I wanna make.

Hi CanuckCT, How have u been? I noticed that the indicator expired. What is the plan on further development on this indicator project? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hey there, I'll be back in May. Check post #244....it's the source code for the indicator. You can edit the expiration date. Search for 2008 and change it to 2028. Twenty years should be enough. Cheers CanuckCT

This guy has far too much time on his hands. I've been busy and haven't been here much. Tax time. I log in today to post a message and I stumble onto this private message for TweeddleDumb.

Sorry, I thought you knew what an Indicator and a Template was. Wasn't sure what the Arrow indicator and one of the other ones was on your chart and where to get them. It's Ok if you have a little retard in you, it's not your fault you were born that way. I know it must be hard for you come to terms with it but it's Ok you've got death lurking around you soon.

Take it easy

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hey Matrix! How have you been? Guess there is a little misunderstanding arising between you and demundus, who is not a great friend of making his texts readable! But in the first sentence, he is referring to the infration that CanuckCT received from the mod here - and then in the second part, he is "not understanding what you exactly meant". So he was NOT insulting you in any way here, he just answered in the shortest possible way to two completely different posts and topics! So - let there be love! Hehehe! and maybe you can just take off you post, my friend! Have a nice weekend, both of you! Ciao! Gnat

Not only do I use this for forex, but it has become my underlying stock screen as well. I use it on a broader 30 minute scale and play multi day trades for $. CanukCT is the man!!

I don't know why this thread seems to have died so suddenly especially with traders like Demundus , Awesome792 ,cl3307 etc all posting good results using Canuck's method, whats happened to the users of this scalp method? Any one interested in continuing this thread? Seems like a few harsh words between 2 traders has chased people away from this thread, Or maybe everyone just went to the chat room? There is still interest in using this method though so a continuation of this thread would not be unwise. I use this method to trade Gbp/Jpy only, as I have other scalp methods for the Eur/Usd , those are the only 2 pairs I have been trading for the last 3 years. Lets see if anyone else wants to revitalize this thread to its former glory! Trk

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I would not have any problem to continue here, especially if Lady Awesome could be around again! But it seems that Carnuck is trading other ways by now. I have this thread in my rather endless subcription list, so keep it alive and I will be around! Ciao! Matt - Gnat

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I have only recently started using this method of trading on the GBP/JPY , I ordinarily traded only the EUR/USD and GBP/JPY but found my method for scalping the Pound Yen didn't produce very well so concentrated on EUR/USD mainly but always wanted to trade the Beast, so I am trying this method on my live account.... I was attracted by the seemingly consistent results, makes me wonder though ,with this method performing so well why is Canuck trading other methods now? here are Friday's 3 trades I made nothing too amazing but ok considering it was the day after NFP and a bank holiday. + 36pips for the day : 1st trade: +23 , 2nd: +8 , 3rd: +5 hope this is not beginners luck.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I am enjoying this method of scalping more and more so I decided to apply it to my Eur/Usd 5min charts with very nice results...I finished the day 74 pips to the good, enough to keep me happy. Will keep trading this method until an obvious flaw in the system exhibits itself but I trade in hope that it doesn't.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thought I'd post a chart of the 2 evening trades I made.(Eur/Jpy this time, I'm really getting experimental!) Only had time to take 2 trades , I was aiming at pivots for the P/T's and as you can see the pair was kind to me, hit both targeted pivots for a total of 31 pips profit...so that puts the pip count at 105 for the day. almost got touched out on my 1st trades S/L , it came 1pip from my stop but then reversed and gave me 14 pips (good indication that my broker is honest I think) heres the chart...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I have also recently began to trade this system. I like the results so far. I am using the original setup and it seems easy to follow. I will try to post some charts later in the week.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hallo TRK! Amazing results! You certainly got the hang of it and like demundus said - it works nicely not only with currencies, but also on stocks and indizies! Thanks for posting your results - it will keep this system from being washed away here on FF. Ciao &amp; See ya! Gnat - Matt

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hello Okc! I think it is a good system to start with and actually you only need ONE that works for you and then you just have to stick to your own rules and tight money management. I would love to see some of your charts later on! Keep it up! Ciao! Gnat

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Gnat , thanx , I agree the results have been good so far but I'm not so sure that I have a handle on it completely quite yet, but I will keep posting and be open to suggestions. I agree with you about the money management, it is of prime importance. Okc , WELCOME! looking forward to hearing your results and see'ing some charts. What pairs are you using it on? cheers

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Ock , I also started using the standard setup for this method, but I found the Madro-golden filter posted by dfxtrader ( post 205 ) very useful in filtering false signals. You might want to attach it to a chart and see if its of use to you. cheers Trk

--- 帖子 #274 ---
A trade I took this morning. My entry came at the red vertical line, though as you can see the signal was generated a couple of bars before. As the M2 line was acting as support, I wanted to see price dip below those recent lows before actually getting into the trade. Once I got the signal I put in a limit order for 1 pip below the low of 1.5658. The order triggered and I rode it straight down to the S1 line for 17 pips. I used the same technique to filter a couple of trades last night, both were winners. As trends typically follow breakouts and since this system is trying to catch mini-trends, it makes sense (and cents!) to wait and get in on a breakout after a signal is generated. An additional filter could be to only trade in the direction of the trend on the 15m chart.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Here is a trade from last night. I intend to post the winners and the losers. The setup looked proper to me but it retraced exactly to my SL then took off. This is an example of how sometimes you just lose a trade. I am trying this system on Eur/Usd, Usd/Jpy, Gbp/Usd, Eur/Jpy, Gbp/Jpy, and Usd/Chf. I use an initial 20-25 pip SL and set a 15 pip trailing stop once I'm in the green. I work a full time job so I am able to trade the New York session then again after work right up to the London open. I am hoping to be able to adjust my schedule soon to trade the London session only. I used to trade that session and the moves appear to be less erratic. I was not able to trade so far today due to a prior commitment, however, it looks like there were some good trades on the boards. Anyways, here is my trade. Stopped out for a 24 pip loss:

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Okcpippin, Two things about this trade. First, the best setups occur when the stochastics are smooth and coming down from overbought or up from oversold. The stochastics right before your entry, while below 50, were erratic and had been ranging in the middle. Second, you could have set a limit order to get in 1 pip below the candle that generated your signal, since the next candle didn't make a new low, you wouldn't have gotten in. Hope you have better luck tonight.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I see what you mean about the stochastics. They were erratic before crossing 50. I have not used this indicator much in the past so I am still learning to read it. I have traded a lot of moving average cross systems but they are not for me. I have thought using a limit order for some of my trades. It seems that sometimes i get in right at the top or bottom where waiting 1-3 more pips before entering would have kept me out of a losing trade. I will try using that tonight if I have the chance. Thanks for the input!!!!!!! OKC

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Ocelot, great idea on filtering by waiting for a pip lower or higher than previous low/high , Ill be putting that to use as well, limit orders might just do the trick. Thanks for advice on stochs as well I think I might have taken a trade or 2 with the stochs not moving properly. Okc , I had a -22pip day today as well , I stop trading after 2 losing trades ,rekon Ill have to re-think my stop losses been using a 11 pip S/L on Eur/Usd (I forget this isnt a scalp method) will try the 20pip S/L and see how it works. Maybe I lost because I didn't trade the London open which has been when my trades worked well up till now. Will stick to London open from now. Hope you make positive pips tomorrow! Cheers Trk

--- 帖子 #279 ---
First, heartfelt thanks to Canuck for this system, it's a real shame this thread has almost died. I am having mixed success at the mo, partly due to my own stupidity, partly due to sideways movements in almost every pair. If only I had taken all the trades I can see when I look back at the days charts! I intend to try some 1M trades tomorrow. Once again, thanks Canuck, if you have moved on to another system, it must be truly awesome! Colin

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hey Rhombus, It will be very interesting to see if you can make it work on 1min charts because Canuck mentioned that it is not really a scalp method but rather a method to ride the trend on a 5min chart.( a fact I forget from time to time) I wish you success on the 1min charts tho and look forward to see'ing your results. good trading! Trk

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hope everybody made some pips today. I missed an entry in Gbp/Usd this morning that looks like it would have worked well. I entered the market late today and it was range bound by then. I still made some pips today but not on this method. I returned to scalping because of the price action. I have caught a few trends with system already and I am looking forward to catching some more. Rhombus, I too an interested to see if you can make this work on the 1 min. I trade the 1m sometimes but only for another scalping method that I use and then I only use it to lead the 5 min. Good luck and please keep us posted. Ocelot, Thanks for the limit order tip!! It saved my butt a couple of time today, I am not used to using limit orders coming from a scalping background but i did come in handy. OKC

--- 帖子 #282 ---
No sweat. The key to success with this system, and this probably applies to all systems really, is to be aware of market conditions while you're trading. Since we're trying to catch trends we need to be wary of ranging conditions. Trading breakouts (with confirmation of our indicators) is going to give us an edge here. Using limit orders just outside of price ranges (highs and lows, etc.) will help to keep us out of the market if after a signal is generated price reverses back into it's range. A more advanced technique for those you familiar with support and resistance trading would be to actually trade the opposite of the signal generated if the scenario above plays out. For example, price is at the top of it's range, since it's been going up for a few bars, our indicators generate a long signal. Price is not able to pierce the high though and reverses, this would be an opportunity to now short even though the system just gave us a buy signal. Your stop would be just above the high and your take profit level would be the bottom of the range. Since we're already near the high of the range this gives us a favorable risk to reward ratio.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I get email updates from this thread so I thought I'd drop a line. Ive been so successful with this system and my own personal tweak of it that I'm starting a website to sell the system for the stock market. It's not exactly like Canucks, so it's not really stealing because I had to do some serious tweaking for normal graphs (most charts dont have absolute strength). the x50 along with 2 other strategies will be broken down in detail in video lessons. I'll create a link so some of you can have it for free (limited downloads), since I owe my starts to this forum. The only advice I can offer is to trade on your gut, and trust the system, dont jump the gun and trade when the indicators give you the go ahead. Here's a picture of one of my trades over a month period. http://www.reverantsilence.com/images/pdo.jpg

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hey Demundus, Its great you're still profiting from trading this system, gives us renewed faith as we slowly get a grip on this method ourselves. Very generous of you to share your tweaked method! we look forward to see'ing what you've added , or how you've modified this system to suite your style. May it hail pips on all who use this system!!! Trk

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Well I squeezed out a scalp this morning for 14 pips. I entered the trade maybe a bar later than normal but I wanted to see price break the 58 level first. It stalled out and hovered around the pivot at 72 so I thought I would just take the 14 pips. I too am looking forward to seeing the tweaks added to this system. Happy Trading!!! OKC

--- 帖子 #286 ---
OCK, Nice trade! I didn't manage to spend any decent amount of time in front of the screens today so only got 12pips on a 1min pull back and continuation after the Bernanke news (don't know if He caused the mini bull run today or not)....I don't usually trade news but looked like a good entry. will be posting some charts again next week when I have time. Trk

--- 帖子 #287 ---
This is the second time my trailing stop has prevented a larger winning trade. I have been careful and using a 15 pip trailing stop on my trades until I get a better feel. This trade with for +8 but had the chance to go a lot further. I am going to extend my trailing stop to 20-25 pips now and give my trades a chance to run. Anyways here it is:

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I thank everyone for their posts, I have been reading this thread for the last 3 hours and am very interested. It appears that the indicators in post #1 are still very valid and I will demo them. I don't have a lot of luck getting templates on to my trading platform but I think I can add them from the indicator list. I like this concept because it is more visual, ie how the various indicators line up (or don't) and not so much discretionary - at least that is my interpretation. Will try to get set up tonight and see if Fri offers anything. Thanks again all, p.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hey Sonic, thanx for the heads up , will keep an eye out for any re-painting on the Madro. Fortunately though the MF is not one of the main trade indicators, its just a nice confirmation indicator , but if it re-paints then we will have to be careful. Its been a busy week for me ,with managing my clients accounts. so I havnt had too much time to trade this method, will post charts as soon as I have a chance again. Thanx OCK for posting your charts, looks like you are doing well with this method. keep them coming brother! Trk

I absolutely cannot get the Absolute Strength indicator to load on to the chart. I can get its icon on the desktop but that's it. 3 calls to IBFX didn't get it to work. Any ideas? And would load the "template" link in post #1 load all 3 indicators? I am really baffled right now and any help would be appreciated. Thanks, p.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
piprac, you need to get the indicator into you documents file. Left click on the Absolute Strength Indicator and save it to the my docs file. Then you can paste it into the indicator file in your MT-4 platform. Remember you have to close the chart program for the indicator to Load. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks for the prompt reply stitch, I'll try it right now. p it didn't work

--- 帖子 #294 ---
It does work! Apparently my computer needs more than a 1-2 minute shutdown of MT4 to load a custom indicator. Got up this morning and there it was. Thank you for your help, p.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Piprac, not sure if this will work but download the attached version of AS then follow this procedure... 1: Compile the file in Meta Editor. 2: Choose ''save as'' and save it to the indicators folder of yr MT4. 3: Restart Mt4. 4: Select the X-50 template , and hopefully it will appear on your chart. Hope you manage to get it working. Trk

Heres a trade I took a little while ago... I jumped in a touch early because I liked what I was seeing on the charts. Not a text book entry, but it was showing enough potential to make me believe I had the edge in my favor. Trk

Heres a short trade I took to scalp 10 pips out of the short term range that the Euro is in presently. Demundus , are you still planning on sharing your tweaks you have made to this system? I'm sure there is interest in your modifications and application to stock trading. Rhombus , have you had any success in applying this method to the 1min charts? Trk

Yesterday a.m. I got killed, this a.m. I scalped some profits. I can see that I cannot trade live with IBFX with this strategy as the spreads are too big. i am using Oanda for the trades and most times see a 3-4 pip difference in the spread between IBFX and O. If I had the money I would use an ECN for this and just grab a few pips here and there. p

Hi Guys, Thought I'd join in since I see renewed interest here... For further confirmation, I like to use a 5-8 MA cross, with visual signal (indicator attached). Once you get the cross, followed by a good X50 setup, you will be in a a very high probability trade. Helps me to enter only the best setups. Here's one from this morning. I only took a small profit, but it went a full +25 if you stayed with it. Good trading all...

The mas are EMAs, 5 &amp; 8? edit: I missed that great run too.l

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Yes, Those are EMAs (sorry, forgot to mention).

--- 帖子 #302 ---
K2KV, thanx for the input, thats an interesting addition. I use 5/8 crosses , along with the 21 and 55 and 200 Ema's amongst other things , with my main strategy for 15min charts, but have never thought of using them on 5min charts.Trk

i think this system work for me, thx

Can someone point me to the rhythm indicator? Search as I may, I cannot find it. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Jerz , I have never seen a separate mq4 file for the rhythm indicator. I may be wrong but, every time I load all 4 of the indicators in the 1st post and then use the X50 template (also in the 1st post) then it seems to appear on my charts. I have done this on 3 different platforms , and the rhythm indicator appears on all of them as long as I load all 4 of the other indicators into my indicators folder. Have you tried this already? or are you wanting to use the rhythm indicator separately? hb2 , hope you manage to find this method very profitable, keep us posted of your results. Trk

here is only the 4th losing trade I have had with this system...(-24pips) I was going for the continuation with a cross back up above the 50 line on the Stochs, the AS was still alright for a continuation at the time , as well as the MACD which was above the water line. I suppose the Stochs could have been better with the %D being above the %K (blue above red) rather, but sometimes things just don't go right,its just part of the game. So far though the success rate of this system for me has been 12 wins and 4 losers with a total pip gain of 112 pips, so no complaints. Trk

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Good going; I was successful until the last 2 trades - pushed too hard and gave it all back. But the EMAs have helped me spot better trades so I should get better with practice. thanks all, p.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi TRK, If I'm reading your chart correctly (from the tiny blue arrow at the top by the shooting star), the AS indicator is telling you NOT to take the long trade. The fact that the blue AS line was above the red was insignificant. More telling was that is was pointing downward at the time, and the red line was at the bottom, getting ready to rise up (accompanied by a fall in price). When reading the AS indicator, the most important factor is the strength of the move from the line at the bottom of the window . If red is at the bottom and it starts to bend upward, prices should begin to fall. If the blue line is at the bottom, prices should rise as it turns upward. So, the more vertical the line moves up from the bottom, the more reliable the indication of subsequent price movement (red line=short, blue line=long). Once that line begins to turn downward, all bets are off. Also, just for clarification, your stoch window is comprised of two separate stochs -- 5,3,3 and 14,3,3. One is red, the other blue. They are not the D &amp; K lines you referred to. You could trade with just the 5,3,3 if you wish, but having the 14,3,3 moving along with it does add some additional confidence. You're doing well!! Hope that helps...

Hi k2kv, thanx for the insight, its much appreciated. I will be more wary of those points in future, up till now I have been focusing on and trading only the standard setups , I was trying to get in on a continuation move but I think I need to re-read the criteria for that sort of trade. thanx again for the advice its a great help. cheers piprac , thanx , I'm sure with help and advice from traders like K2KV , Demundus , Ocelot and others I will get a real handle on this method and boost the success rate even further. glad to hear you are also doing very well with this system. Trk

--- 帖子 #310 ---
You're quite welcome. But, just to set the record straight -- I never did say I was doing well with this! Frankly, trading 5M charts had become a bit too choppy/stressful so I've moved to 1H and daily charts for now. Nevertheless, I am familiar with the X50 rules and indicators, as I had participated early on with Canuck while he was defining the strategy (I only gave it a name). That said, sometimes the 1H charts can put me to sleep, so when that happens I tend to come back down to 5M to see if there are any promising X50 trades in the making. Take care, good trading...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi guys.. Jeffs point with the AS indicator is excatly correct on the 5min TF if you wait for the cross you may have missed the trade, also look for the angle up from the bottom and a seperation of the two lines the wider the more strength...also as a side the setting 14,3,3 Stoch is better suited to a daily...and in this case will only give you a overall trend.. Happy hunting.. Glenn

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thought I would add charts with the indicator...as they say a picture is worth a thousand words... The second one is a modification of mine when i traded this method ( for a few weeks) the Williams just adds the volume coming in so you can see if the move is strong or weak... Glenn

--- 帖子 #313 ---
k2kv , sorry for the misunderstanding, I was referring to piprac who said he has been successful up until the last 2 trades. I agree with you about the 5min time frame though , I trade 15min and hourly TF mainly and use this method only occasionally , it just sits on my 4th monitor until I see something of interest...but with the high success rate I have experienced I guess I got a little over confident wanting to enter on a continuation. glenn5t , thanx for the info , Its much appreciated. Trk

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Canuck, Hi there mate - Just wanted to know are you still using the UT/Ultra Trend Indicator? I have had this one for over a year and have played around with it. It looks promising. Just wanted to know what your current setup is - I am using your origional posted on thread #1. Cheers, VB,

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hi VB , I may be wrong but I have not personally seen Canuck active on this thread since his last post on the 5th April , hopefully he still monitors this thread and will answer your question. Trk P.S : anybody using the EA developed for this system? does it work? I haven't seen any posts with results from the EA , also is anyone using the indicator?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks for the heads up Trk, Has anyone had much success with this system? - I gave it a go last night with mixed results on the 5M. Is anyone using the Ultra Trend/UT indicator to confirm entry at all? Is that part of the rules? I haven't read past post #183 - so I'll have another look a bit later on tonight when I get time. Thanks again Trk, Cheers to you all, VB,

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I have been trading this system for the last couple of weeks and it is the best I have found. I have been trading Forex for the last 3 years and now understand how the market moves. With this system it gets you in very early in any move - it is just a case of timing the exit. I take the slowing down of the predominant AS as the exit point. Stop loss at the low of the indicating candle. Best set ups - AS moving away and Stochs not in overbought/oversold area at time of trade. Hope it helps! Al P.S. I use it on 1H charts

--- 帖子 #318 ---
VB , I have had pretty good success so far even though it is not my main trading method...up to date i have had 14 trades 4 losers and 10 winners with the pip count at +154. I believe Demundus , Ocelot and others who have a real handle on this method are producing very good results as well. They have been a real help to me with good advice and great ideas to identify high probability trades. I would recommend you try Ocelots method of placing pending orders 1pip above or below the high/low to keep you out of losing trades as far as possible. also k2kv posted a very useful indy (5/8 MA cross) that also helps in identifying better setups. (not making these recommendations cos I'm a pro with this method, I have learned A LOT from these guys and others on this thread , so it might help you as well) Keep reading the posts brother , hope you will have success with this method as well. ACartwright, glad to hear you having success as well! Interesting you are using it on the hourly charts, Iv been thinking about that myself lately. Trk

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I do not have the discipline or skill to use this system on a 5 miunte chart. My personal opinion is that you never get a real handle on the s/r. Hourly charts give you a better overview of trend direction - you do not need any ma's on a hourly chart as you should be able to see which direction price is going.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
ACartwright , Do you use the standard indicator settings and just apply them to your 1hr chart or do you adjust the settings of any of the indicators? Trk

--- 帖子 #273 ---
There is no tweaking with the indicators - I just use the same standard ones for the hourly charts!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
ACartwright , thanx , I'm going to be looking at applying the the X50 template to my hourly charts soon ,I'm having good success with the 5min charts but I must admit prefer slightly longer time frames. your SL and PT I imagine at least double in size. I think I'm going to have to work with 45-65 pip SL on hourly charts rather than the normal 20-30 on 5min charts. Thanks for the input AC . Trk

--- 帖子 #275 ---
All , Is any one using the EA or indicator created for this method? I find it surprising that there is little discussion about the EA and Indy , is it because they are inaccurate or simply don't work? If you use one of these or even both please post your results , or at least your impression of their accuracy and usefulness. Thanx Trk

--- 帖子 #276 ---
TRK, You might want to consider a SL which is derived from the technicals on your chart, rather than just using some arbitrary number. In other words, think about placing SL at a price where, if hit, you would consider the trade dead. That might be, for example, the other side of the present or previous bar, or some S&amp;R pivot level, fibs, etc.). Then, you can determine where you expect to take profit (also from the technicals on the chart) and weigh the risk against the potential reward in order to determine if the trade will be worth your while. Arbitrary SL is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are a tech trader (as most forex traders are), your charts should be able to guide you in all of your decisions, not just price movement. Good trading...

--- 帖子 #277 ---
k2kv , thanx for the advice , I agree with you whole heartedly , and I employ that on my main system of trading, I thought though that seen as we are dealing with a mechanical system that static SL's might be the norm. thanx for setting me straight (I must admit I was using static 25 pip SL on the 5min system) I'll be more open to using the technicals on my hourly charts to choose SL placements. thanx again. Trk

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I agree! I use the the low of the idicating candle as the stop loss. Depending on the pair it could be 15 to 35 pips. If there is a small stop loss i.e. 7 pips I always go a little more as there is a higher chance that it could come back lower. TP when the as start to even off.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Anyone still trading LIVE this system?I want to know more about it's results,what is it's win/loss ratio and drawdown.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Looks like the thread starter seems to have disappeared for a few months now.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
You try you know.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I have also been wondering what has happened to Canuck, I did not see him get any infractions so he cant be banned. Maybe moved on to bigger things, got too busy or just lost interest. I am still also wondering if the EA for this system works. I havnt been able to get it to take even 1 trade, even though I think the settings are all correct. Trk

--- 帖子 #283 ---
hi every one, i wanted to know where do you put your SL and when you decided to exit from the trade? thank's zada

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hello, Thank you for sharing this system. I am using it and have a set up on my chart which is described in post#1 plus some exponential moving averages to help to make better trading decisions. Try it: EMA 5 close EMA 13 open EMA 21 close EMA 55 close EMS 200 close The 200 shows you if we are in a bullish or bearish area. If the 55 is obove the 200 and the 21 is crossing the 55 from below you have a confirmation for a bullish trend. Now you look for the 5 to cross the 13 from below and your signel to buy is confirmed.Compare it with the MACD 5,13,1. The same for sell orders. The 55 must be below the 200 and the 21 is crossing the 55 from above. Now you look only that the 5 is crossing the 13 from above. Your sinal is confirmed. I like to see the ema's which gives me a better picture. And also: After crossing5/13: if the 5 is moving away from the 13 your trend gets stronger. After crossing 21/55: If the 21 is moving away from th5 55 your trend gets stronger. I also have Bollinger Bands 20/2 Sorry for my english, hope it is onk to understand. Just put the ema's on you chart and have a look if you like it. Holger

Hi all, I must say that after weeks of testing the method, and by adding Golden MACD as substitute for H4 MACD as per Post #1, I am more confident with my trades, and I now could accept if my SL is hit and go on looking for next better entries; and I sort of find out that a better trade is the one with the Golden MACD's bar not too flat, that is to say IF the bar is growing bigger in size, I could ride on until it changes colour to DarkGrey. So, If I'm already in the trade and the MACD bars are flat, I just close my post. Cheers, Safuan

System still helping to time entries....10 pips on AUDJPY bounce.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
CanuckCT Thank you! I'll try.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Interesting looking system. Is there any benefit to trying to trade in the direction a higher time frame trend perhaps avoiding getting caught in a small pullback?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
hi canuckct thanks for sharing the system is there an alert for the system
