Hi While working away trying to make trend trading mechanical I kept coming back to ZZ indicator.. One thing you must be aware of and the terms 'eggs and sucking' spring to mind here but dont forget on the current wave the zz can change but the past zz waves are locked in place and its these we use. I have looked at it on my fav time frames the 5min..not too slow that you get bored and not to fast that you get manic This type of system may of been posted here before but I couldnt find any thing under a search. Im rushing out in 10mins but wanted to put some thing down on paper just to lock it here and remind me to post a few things about it. Its selective last week on eurusd 5min only 7 signals +1+30+44-14+4+40+71 initialy Put a ZZ on your 5min chart set to 13-5-5 we use this for entry Trend magic - we use this for our sliding stop A vertical line at 8am uk time and another at 8pm uk time ...we dont trade the Asian session. use this link to look at the forex opening times..just put in your location and click go..the chart above will then update with the correct times http://www.forexmarkethours.com/ Will be back in 3 hours to show entry stops etc Again please dont see this as faultless but see it as one to stick into the armourey personaly I love it Paulus

Ok this is not ground breaking stuff or some thing I have invented...I just think we have to be aware of it. A common way to trade is long on the break of a swing high short on the break of a swing low. ZZ helps us with this if you look at the chart below you will see A this is fixed B this is fixed C this is fixed The vertical red line is just 8am uk time..At 8.05 we mark 2 horizontal lines at the last 2 Fixed ZZ points in this case B and C which I have marked with 2 blue horizontal lines We enter short at E with the inital stop at the last high given us by ZZ in this case D . We follow down the horizontal lines on trend magic always 1 behind the current one...we move down a horizontal stop level each time trend magic moves down so with price at 1 are stop is at 2 withprice at 3 our stop is at 4 etc etc. In this case with our stop at 5 we were taken out giving us around 70 pips. 2nd signal on 2nd chart Entry at A stop at the ZZ swing low point in this case the lower blue line then follow up as TM moves up to be taken out at B for around 40pips its mechanical easy to follow.. have a play paulus

Do you use something to filter out false breakouts? We can even see some on your charts. Should there be a minimum distance between two lines?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi, Why didn't you go long on the first upward move (D)? Eeven though that proved out to be wrong. What sort of breakout are you looking for? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Archie The highs at B and D were different 1.36258 at B as opposed to 1.36258 at D With 5 digit brokers you want to go to nearest higest full pip so if the high at B was 1.36258 you want to go long at 1.3626 And any break out is taken after 8am UK time investalot can you show me the break outs aprt from the 2 examples please,dont forget any breakout up or down before 8am is ignored Paulus

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I have shown 2 days of last week above ..here is the monday as you can see My vertical line drawn at 8am uk time My high and low of last fixed ZZ marked with horizontal blue line 1st sig Entry on 1st signal was at the yellow box trade was taken out by trend magic at Out 1 +3 pips 2nd sig I then wait for another fixed ZZ to go in.. and I have marked it with a green horizontal line entry at the yellow box again Trade was taken out by trend magic at Out 2 +28 pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This is very similar to other breakout systems using GBPUSD. Taking the highest-high and the lowest-low between midnight and the London open to create a breakout box. There are inevitable false breakouts but these can be minimised by using a 5 EMA as the trigger rather than the price. Place the trade on the next bar-close after the 5 EMA breaks-out. Good luck with your thread.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Geoff I use a London break out and a US break out system... this trades all day and gives more chances Its also along the same lines as the Darvas Box ..ie creating a box with a high and low and moving up or down with each box cheers paulus

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Using 5 EMA to reduce false break-out!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
yes slightly diff approach but well, worth looking at here is an example of a typical signal on close of Friday Last hi and lo of fixed ZZ has been marked with a signal to go short at the yellow box Again the good thing here is that you can put in a lmt buy at the top green line and lmt sell at the bottom green line

--- 帖子 #11 ---
HI Paulus I liked it very Innovative Idea

--- 帖子 #12 ---
How about these breakouts?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Investalot My ideal window is 8am uk time up to 8pm UK time... Reasons... 8am to 8pm covers the UK and US market trading hours..I think I stated 8am in the 1st post but didn't post the 8pm shut off I just dont think you get the volatility with the Sydney and Tokyo exchanges and all systems need volume and volatility without it the best of system die so I wouldn't of traded them but I want to look at them yes they are signals and like all system you get good and bad ..with money management and a stop loss in place we can absorb the losers. 1st signal Long at 1.3771 SL last swing low 1.3715 = 56 pips Account £2000 Risk 5% of current bank per signal - £100 EURUSD 1 pip on full contract = £6.60 56 pip SL x £6.60 = £396.60 too much as it exceeeds our 5% Mini contract 1pip = £0.66p 56 pips SL x £0.66p = £36.96 well below our 5% value of £100 We trade 2 mini contracts 2 x £36.96 = £73.92 Result Taken out at 1.3754 a loss of 17 pips 1 pip = £0.66p 17 pips x 0.66p = £11.12 1/10th of our £100 5% value. We had a losing trade but our bank was protected. 2nd signal had approx the same stop value with the same calculations as above but the loss was only 5 pips or £3.30 ..way way below our 5% £100 value If you want a walk through on this trade I will do so if requested 3rd signal I wouldnt of taken this as trend magic was Blue which indicates a long bias..we need red TM Im glad you asked this question as I can now update the 1st post with my day end time and the roll of trend magic Paulus

--- 帖子 #14 ---
By the length and configuration of the candles on the stop-outs in post 13, it would be a good guess that the time was around a news event. I went back and looked and, sure enough, it was at the time of FOMC. We wouldn't be in there trading this at that time but on the sidelines.... Also, if you do this or any trade on a 5 minute chart, the trade off is the noise inherent in the time frame. So you factor that in as a bigger probability than if you were on a 30-60 minute chart. But my other question, Paulus, is why you wouldn't use TM as your stop from the very beginning of the trade since you use it eventually. The ZZ stops are often too big.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Good point..should always consider news events.. thanks the reason I do not use TM initially is that I want a hard good supporting stop as my initial placement and thats normaly the last swing lo or hi. With this system there is often a pull back after entry to place on TM would get you taken out to quickly Ive shown the moves on an ABC etc principle On the lower chart for the more conservative is a method of entry with the stochastic.. Using the same signal we get our trigger at A We wait for a pull back to enter and use the stochastic to do this when it goes down past 50 and ticks up we enter draw back - we may miss some signals but draw down is less initial risk less which means more contracts traded on MM calculations Paulus

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Please change ZZ to 13 This seems to fit in best with the 6 swaps m looking at.. 20 sets the bounds too large on some swaps I have updated the 1st post to say 13 and cut of at 8pm uk time P

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Paulus, I've been watching the system, and I have some questions. 1) Do you only use the first bottom and top for the breakout for the day, or do you move the lines according to new ZZ points? 2) How many trades do you take per day? E.g. when the first buy hits its SL, and the sell goes off, is that's it for the day? A good example was Friday. 3) I wonder about some sort of buffer. Often the price touch the last high/low, but then retraces. What about a buffer of 5 pips? Thanks in advance! Archie

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi Archie 1) Do you only use the first bottom and top for the breakout for the day, or do you move the lines according to new ZZ points? set the 1st 2 if available just after 8am..they need to be 'locked' so they wont move ..if the next zz is lower than the previous high and locks then move the horizontal line down same for lows see the example below 2) How many trades do you take per day? E.g. when the first buy hits its SL, and the sell goes off, is that's it for the day? A good example was Friday. Taking 70 pips on the Fridays trade you'd have to be a hard man to carry on most people would bank the pips and close down..but this is a personal thing stop or go on..I tend to go on for my session ie 8pm close down If your money management model has you taking 20 pips a day then closing down then so be it...others trade on to destruction... its down to the individual 3) I wonder about some sort of buffer. Often the price touch the last high/low, but then retraces. What about a buffer of 5 pips? No i wont go this way I have tried this type of thing on the Asian and london break systems..from 5 to 10 ..10 to 15 its not for me.If you want a buffer try the 5ema as suggested earlier in the thread that will work cheers for now Paul

--- 帖子 #19 ---
This is the one hour time frame nothing changed regrading the ZZ setting this week 3 signals yellow box marks entry 1st was a no go as TM was blue on the break down..but it would of made around 65 pips 2nd made 70pips 3rd still in I have marked where the stop would be now with around 160 pips locked in

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi again, What about if price already has passed either of the ZigZag points, before 8 am? Do you wait for the next low/high then, or do you take the trade either way? An example is 10th March. Also, which TF have you had most success with, in terms of avoiding false BO and profitability? I watched the 15M and it seems that it has less false breakouts. Archie

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Thanks, Paulus, for this excellent thread. I found it because I have been noticing that the zigzag is an excellent signal and very versatile and I was searching FF to see if anyone had started a thread. You had just started this an hour before! Auspicious, hey? It looks like the 5 ema is a pretty good filter. I won't use stochs, MACD, etc as I have been burned too many times with them. Higher time frames, DeMark type diagonal trend lines, where price breaks them, etc. Lots of ways to filter... If you have MT4, you might try this one that I found on another thread. It seems pretty reliable. Please keep this thread up, Paulus. You are one heck of a creative brain looking at charts...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Another way to enter could be above/below the first candle that fails to keep the trend going. A 1 2 3 entry or even a fib on a smaller TF for a small retrace and continuation. There are many ways to get in with minimal risk.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
very quick powerful moves in some cases today and TM not able to keep the pace I have seen 3 signals on EURUSD Long went for a max of 30 pips Short went for a max of 45 pips and long from 1.3523 However if you go by TM we get around 0 and 0 lols for the 2 trades because as fast as it went up it collapsed..what i think is called a sudden explosive move If these moves were news driven then I think a cap of at least 1:1 risk reward should be applied.. So... if long and the hard stop is 20 pips away take 20 as your TP etc etc If these moves were not news driven then its just unfortunate,with strong power up moves and small tired retracements ZZ isnt going to put in a correction same with strong drops with small weak rallies.. Others I follow usdjpy 1 short sig + 28 pips flat at mo usdchf - 1 long sig for zero although went to 25 .currently short from 1.0616 SL at 1.0603 EURGBP 1 short sig -8 currently short from 1.9014 sl at 0.8981 eurjpy 1 long sig +4 currently 1 short sig +68 cheers P

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes, it seems good to keep RR at minimum 1:1, since movements vary quite a lot from day to day. Do you have any experience how this has performed historically? Also, have you tried other opening times, like 7 GMT, when Frankfurt opens. Seems it can be good as well, though perhaps too many false BO's. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Archie Ive looked at Frankfurt you do get a few good moves but on the whole think they lack the real volume you initialy get in the London session start. Ive looked at fixed TP and SL ..its a good way to trade 15 pips TP 15 pips or 10 pips SL but it really doesn't take into account the daily fluctuation in liquidity...thats where using TM hopefully comes in to catch the bigger moves havnt got alot of history on in purely because i came across the idea trying to make another system and thread ( mech trend trading) more mechaincal..5min only because its not to slow to be boring but fast enough to be interesting.. signal update on the open positions I have seen 3 signals on EURUSD Long went for a max of 30 pips Short went for a max of 45 pips and long from 1.3523 ..this closed for 26 pips USDCHF - 1 long sig for zero although went to 25 Currently short from 1.0616 .. this closed for 41 pips EURGBP 1 short sig -8 currently short from 1.9014 sl at 0.8981..this closed for 33 pips

--- 帖子 #26 ---
The 1hour signal in post 19 closed for 210 pips P

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi, How do you set SL for the initial order for larger TF's like the 1H, since the opposite ZigZag can be very far away? Archie

--- 帖子 #28 ---
same swing lo hi just use your money management and 5% of bank rule..its the safest way to build your account ..esp with lmt history on a system like this... Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #29 ---
we have 2 choices here Use TM and try to stay in for the longer moves..but may have to be prepared to see large gains closed out for break even trades Or Us a fixed TP with a smaller fixed SL..if we do this we need to tie down the entry alot tighter. Il take a look cheers P

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Im looking for a ZZ indicator that draws horizontal lines at the peaks ..its out there Ive seen it but cant find it P

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thank you very much for all your help! Archie

--- 帖子 #32 ---
still looking here still on ZZ 13 just looking at diff ways to control trades so far eurusd -15+49 usdjpy still in a trade and at +100 usdchf +52 eurgbp +11 eurjpy still in a trade and at +31 cheers P

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Different ways to control trades? Coming up on anything with that?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
A quick update eurusd -15+49-25 usdjpy still in a trade and at +100..now +148 and still in usdchf +52 eurgbp +11 eurjpy +23 Entry as before but close on colour change of TM.. Im also looking at a better entry with a specific point to bring SL to break even to reduce the risk on false break outs P

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi, It would be great to backtest this system, but I haven't found an EA that works without problems. The test I would like to do, besides normal profitability, is smaller SL/TP values. I think that 20 pips can be ok, using 5M on EURUSD, but it's hard to say for sure. On 1H perhaps 50 pips or larger could work. Also, I like the TM, because of the option to catch larger moves and give the trades some breathing room. Archie

--- 帖子 #36 ---
this is today.... keep it simple, you use a small version of botton box!!, the last small swing there is na hardly probability that break!!!! So the rule is: - last swing break - the tM with same color so u wait the close of candle to see it and not the limit order? When the initial stop is big u prefer wait a retrace on TM and entry with small stop loss? I have seen a similiar indicator that write above/down the swing the price This last 2 days Is funny that not analize the 18 may big caos in sidewinder

--- 帖子 #37 ---
For the other max and min during the day there is not a possibility that made a repaint the indicator? like there is a min at 11.00 and 5 minute this min disappear and appear a new one at 11.05 ? so u get an entry at 11.05 and after the entry the min disappear again!! like this i try to simulate in the past and try to see how it's move live

--- 帖子 #38 ---
You should never trust an indicator until the candle closes and the information is "set".

--- 帖子 #39 ---
i just wait that when he go down he retrace and break the prec hilow it's also intresting to have a Automatic trailing that follow the last TM about break u mean close candle?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I see the Hayseed has come up with an indi now to plot lines at the high and low of the Zigzag. Great addition to this system.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
u stole my indy....hehee its all good

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Just a few things the indy is great but be careful not to use the horizontal line that isnt fixed Things Im looking at having 2 ZZ on a chart to help with better entry Entering on a pull back once a trade is truggered P

--- 帖子 #43 ---
i have made a report about historical data in this 2 week, it's so and so with 3 week is better, the bas is when there is sidewinder or not trending market

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thank you for sharing your strategy. Are you currently trading this on Money account or experimenting on Demo account ? Do you have any statastics so far collected on differrent timeframes and/or differrent pairs ? Thank you once again..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Well. I was trying out this strategy and bumped into some issues. Hope you can help me. First of all, Horizontal lines are not formed at 8.05 UK time. They are supposed to start earlier to UK time.. But I do see them forming around 9sh time.. Are there any settings I need to change to get this done ? Please see pics.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi, What is your broker time? Since we just changed to DST in Europe, London is no longer on GMT, but instead GMT+1, so you have to set the indicator to 7 (if your broker is on GMT). Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #47 ---
FXCM - UK listed. So it is set to UK time. Now my market watch time is 11:23:30 and this is the current London time.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Ok, in that case I don't know why the indicator didn't work. I will try it and get back as soon as I get some time.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Which TF's have you all had success with? I have watched the 5M, but I think that it whipsaws too many times, if TP/SL aren't kept tight. I have also tried the 15M, but I don't think that it performs better than the 5M. I am also backtesting 1H, and it looks more stable. Less intervention and more of a long-term approach, with some trades staying open often more than one day. However both SL and TP have to be increased a lot to cover the huge swings.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
ok. Thank you for your help.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
an example during the wedge a lot of false break

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Paulus, I wonder about SL on larger TF's like 1H. I have tested it on that TF and it seems like it gives good results, provided that you use larger stoplosses. I have used the TM during my tests, and I wonder what your experience is with this line. I think it's really good, but sometimes it can be a bit slow. Also, how do you treat the plateaus, when moving your SL? You said earlier that you move your SL to the previous plateau, when a new one takes form. Sometimes the plateaus are just small edges. Do they still qualify as a new level?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi, When does a ZigZag-point get fixed, so that it doesn't turn into a new low/high? Is a change only possible on the next bar, or can it shift from one point to highs/lows on bars later on?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hello, just gone short on break of zigzag line. Thought i would give this a go Eur/usd moved SL to next trendmagic line. still about 20 pip SL at mo. Entry tested but held. Big bar against my position - failed to keep an eye on news! will keep playing though and see what happens SL to next line. About 7pip SL now SL to BE Stopped out BE. would still be in trade if did not move to BE and instead stuck to the rules! now it is going short again quick!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi all, Interesting method- I quite enjoy the simplicity of it. Here is a picture of the trades I took this morning using this method. Let me know what you think- I think I took the Sell order too early (Broker GMT +1), as the ZigZag point was not fixed. (Red horizontal lines show where the original ZigZag points were) These orders were place and forget- on a live/real account. Over all break even (R:R&gt; 1:1)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi all, Here is how I see todays set up. R:R&gt; 1:1- The range is 63pips- a lot more than yesterday (27pips), so reduced the lot size to reduce the risk.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Best of luck.. Lets us know the result of the trade.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi This mornings trade- Sell stop was hit to the pip!! and closed out about half an hour later. Buy stop has been open most of the day, But I have closed it because it is the Easter weekend and NFP tomorrow. Net Pips so far -21pips Enjoy the weekend. M

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi guys, I think that this system has a really good potential. If you trade on 1H and start looking at charts from UK open, I think you can get stable results. Never try to open a position on Asian session as there are so many false breakouts. If you don't like big SL level, placing a SL at TM line (one step up or below) may be a good idea, I guess. I personally took the last EJ long and secured a profit. Will keep trying on this system on 1H.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi, I agree with you. I have been trying out this system for some time. I also trade the 1H, because it's easier and has less false brakout. Though stressing, as you said, that good volatility is important. Trading the GU at the moment, and the last trade was a loss, and I have a current one open, not going too well at the moment. But this system on the 1H is all about catching larger moves. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi, Here are my trade set ups for today. The sell position in the middle of the screen is part of another trade setup.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Sell order opened and closed for 37 pip profit. Net results to date 16pips Enjoy the weekend M

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Yea, Archie, 1H is the thing. I personally don't trade on NFP day, but will catch up next week. Probably, GU, GJ, and EJ are the pairs to monitor for this system. You have to find a pair that tends to break strong support and resistance and go beyond them without loosing its momentum. If you look at some other pairs, some are less oscillating just going nowhere, some others oscillate much but in a chaotic manner. But pairs like GU, GJ, EJ tend to keep their momentum once they find a direction. (especially on 1H)

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Archie and Far East Man, Could you please put up some 1 hour charts so we can see how the trades looked and how they ended. For me- trading on a 5 min chart seems to work out well (still early days though), Just need to be patient and wait for London open. And I trade with a R:R of 1:1 as opposed to using TM and a Trailing Stop. Your thoughts would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Michael, Here is the trade I took on EJ 1H chart. Attached Image Good to hear you are doing well on 5M. I'm in Japan and I normally go to bed after NY open. So I can't monitor the chart. If you take it on 1H, you can go to bed or do some other things and the trade is almost always open after several hours. So 1H trading just suits me. Besides, monitoring charts exhausts me. 1:1 RR may be good. You can take it mechanically. I like to do it emotion free. I just follow the TM for now and see how it works as the price on 1H chart seems to move in a bit more organized manner than that on smaller timeframes. I'm also interested in tweaking the SL level. At the last trade, I placed my SL below the swing low (Zigzag low), but I think placing a SL at one step below the current TM (for a long trade) would be fine in many cases. Of course, the safer one is the one below the swing low, but when the swing low is far away, using TM line should be good enough, giving better a risk-reward ratio. I'm talking about the case of 1H, not sure about 5M. Hope the up-coming week is fruitful for us. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thank you Far East Man. (A man who sees the sun first) for the visual representation. First of all congratulations for a good trade.. Hope next week brings more pips in our pockets. 1) What are your swing ind parameters, 13, 5, 5 ? right ? 2) I guess, the trade will only be taken on the break of horizontal lines as per the strategy. Is it not right ? In you chart I don't see those horizontal ines.. are they moved to some other area as the price moving ahead ? Please help me understand this.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi Far East Man, Nice clean trade congrats Couple of questions.... What was your initial R:R? It looks like the initial SL was about 90pips and the trade closed out with about 45pips. (For me a R:R of 1:1 takes the emotion out of it- makes it easier to trade) Were you only looking at a buy because the TM was blue i.e. trending up? or were you also looking to sell if it broke the low? Hope next week brings Pips for all- dont forget Monday is a Bank Holiday in UK. M

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for your comments cprao. Yep, 13,5,5. This is just my guess, but if you try larger numbers like 20, 5, 5, you get less false breaks on 1H charts although it reduces your entrires. This will probably help filter bad trades when the market is indecisive. I was using a normal zigzag indi, but now I found ZigZag_Ace.mq4 that draws lines at post#40. I'll use it at the next trade. If you are using ZigZag_Ace.mq4, then yes the trade is opened upon the break of the line. Thanks for your comments, Michael. Since I follow TM and don't set a clear TP, I don't have an initial R:R. It can be more or less than 1:1. If you look at hystorical price moves on 1H charts, you'll see RR is less than 1:1 most of the times. So you have to let the profitable trade run as long as it goes in order to cover occasional losses. But the situation would be different on 5M. Yes, 90 pips SL is big, but I use a tiny micro lot account (less than $500) and trade by percent. So the amount of pips doesn't really matter for me. I'm a strict percentage trader, not a pip trader. My way of figuring out a proper lot sizing is posted in my blog (if any of you are interested) It looks like a bit complicated at first, but once you are used to it, it's easy (spread sheet file would be helpful). And this method allows you to take a trade on longer timeframes if you use a micro account. But with that said, I think your R:R setting is good. On 5M charts you may get so many whipsaws so I think having a solid SL and TP would be a good idea. Keep your 5M trades updated in this thread. I'll keep my 1H trades updated here, too. So we can get differetn perspectives! I actually don't care about the color of TM. On 1H chart, the important thing is to catch a breakout off strong support or resistance after UK open. I'm not saying ignoring the color may be better. I don't actually know which is better. Hope my comments help.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi, Thanks for your detailed reply. My setting on the ZigZag is also 13,5,5. I am also a % trader, so I am not too worried about the pip value just the risk&gt; read your blog, I follow pretty much the same thing!! I will continue to post my 5 min trade setups&gt; time will tell how the week turns out&gt; hopefully some +ve PIPS. M

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thank you MichaelSA &amp; Far East Man, Thanks you for your commitment to post your respective trades on this forum. Far East Man, I looked at your blog - read your % risk strategy.. very impressive.. I read multiple time somewhere but never clearly understood. But your write-up is clear and makes lot of sense.. I like the concept - your rate of profits increases as your capital goes up... in the same way rate of losses decreases if the capital is dwindling.. By the way, I attempted to use this strategy one time on H1 charts but somehow the set-up did not work. I never got the fixed horizontal lines that should pop up after 8.05 AM UK time.. Then I have not tried again .. but I will be following this thread to realize the potential of this strategy. Hence I appreciate your trade updates on this forum. Have a great pips week for both of you.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks for your comments, M &amp; cprao, I'm glad you liked it. Did you get the indy from post#40? The one at post#1 doesn't draw lines. Make sure your indy is this one . It draws a line when either swing high or low is formed regardless of time. However, although those horizontal lines make it easier to comprehend the situation, those are not requirements for this system. You can use a normal zigzag indy without horizontal lines. You can find out what time the UK 8 am is in your local time here . So open your MT4 after UK 8 am, set your buy stop or sell stop order (or both) above or below the swing high or low (zigzag peak or valley) on your preferred chart (with a decent stop). Once the price breaks the peak or valley of zigzag, it's the same thing as the price breaking those horizontal lines. Make sure you add spread when you set a buy stop order. Yep, I'll keep posting my trade here. So you will see.

Thank you. I have downloaded the indy again.. Not sure from which post I downloaded the indy previously. You are right. I don't necessarily need a indy. Based on swing highs and lows I can trade this strategy. Thank you.. Since my MT4 time is GMT+1, I am with UK time. Thank you.. Will help to understand how good is this strategy.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I've placed a buy stop and sell stop above and below the recent swing high and low on GBP/USD. Buy stop: 1.52895 (ZZ high + 4 pip Alpari UK spread + 3 pip buffer) SL: 1.51769 (ZZ low - 3 pip buffer) Sell stop: 1.51769 (ZZ low - 3 pip buffer) SL: 1.52895 (ZZ high + 4 pip Alpari UK spread + 3 pip buffer) Attached Image I was really tempted to trade Yen crosses this time especially after upbeat data from NFP and, also, positive expectations ahead of FOMC. But those Yen crosses currently have long wicks made by NFP, making it unsure about entry and SL. So I have decided to go on with GU this time as the ZZ high and low are clean on this pair. Not really sure how bank holiday would affect. Can be muted or volatile. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
My setup on the previous post was wrong. Since the most recent ZZ high is not fixed, I have to take the previous ZZ high as the buy trigger line. I have modified the triggers. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Good Morning Cprao &amp; Far East Man, I agree- with Europe, UK and Canada all on holiday, today could be either very dull or very volatile. Here are my trades for today (Chart GMT+2). Swing high @ 1.5249 Buy @ 1.5254 (4pips spread + 1 pip), TP 1.5287, SL 1.5221 (Risk 33 pips) Swing low @ 1.5222 Sell @ 1.5221, TP 1.5188, SL 1.5254 (Risk 33 pips) Will post the outcome Far East Man-is your chart a 1 hour chart? (it looks like it, but just checking) M

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi M! Ah, yes, mine is 1 hour chart. I'll update my result, too.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Your swing high is not correct, it is not fixed yet. The one before that is the fixed one. Swing low is correct

--- 帖子 #78 ---
M, you must have won your trade by now. Congrats, mate! Cheers,

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi Howard Thanks for looking at my charts and correcting me on my swing high. Serves me right for doing 2 things at once and not concentrating. M

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi Far East Man, Unfortunately not done yet (missed TP buy 11pips) ......TWT. However I have my doubts that the buy TP (TP 1.5287) will be reached&gt; 1 hour charts are looking very bearish at the moment. If I had used the correct Swing high, as comment by Howard, then I would still be waiting for a trigger. Thanks M

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Ah, I thought you could keep tightening your range of triggers as the swing range shrinks. I think Howard is correct, but if you had kept tightening your trigger range, your TP would have been hit by now. I'm not sure if narrowing the triggers is a good idea or not though. But if I were you, I would keep adjusting the trade setup according to the changing market. Don't take it as an advice. This is just my preference. I have no statistics about it. My bias on GBP/USD is still bullish. But, you know, some years of trading experience tells me that my personal bias (or such guessing work) is highly-likely useless. Market respects nobody. It's the market itself to decide where it goes. So all you can do is to follow the market, and patiently wait for what it does. Besides, only a couple of wins or losses are nothing. We need a long time winning system, and we are in the process of finding it. So everything is fine now whichever the current price goes. Now, I go to sleep. I have to wake up early and play catch with my kid who wants to be a pitcher in his local kid baseball team. Talk to you, tomorrow. Enjoy your day!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Good Morning - Michael,Far East Man and Howard.. Just woke up and looking at the charts. I don't know whether I am going to trade this GBPUSD setup or not yet,, but here is what I see on my chart using this strategy.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi all Here is the result of this mornings setup. Buy order triggered and closed for +33pips Net result to date 49pips

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi Far East Man (enjoy playing catch with your kid, its what really matters) I generally don't tighten my triggers as the swing range decreases. I try log in at London open, place my orders and then get on with the rest of my day. Trying to keep it simple and so far its working, so I am happy. I have also learnt not to trade based on bias (as can be seen today, I had a bearish bias yet had a buy trigger which ended with 33 pips!) Buy as it goes up and sell as it goes down- best advise I have ever had! Hi cprao, Your setup looks similar to Far East Man's, also on a 1 hour chart. Your swing low (sell trigger) is fixed, however your swing high (buy trigger) should be the previous swing high. Good luck all&gt; the 1hour buy trigger is active (I think) M

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thank you for the correction on my chart. I needed that. When I looked at the charts around 7 AM(USA PST) after I posted the charts, my swing high was moved up..I was wondering how to fix that horizontal line.. Now, with your correction it makes sense - my swing high should be the previous swing high .. which should be my baseline for the trade I did't attempt to trade today since I was not sure how news relases (ISM, Pending sales) will impact the trade.. I will try tomorrow .. Thank you once again for the correction.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Congratulations !! How are you determining your target profit here ? Pivot points ? TM indicator ? others ? Sl is swing low ? Sorry if this is already answered before..

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi M, Yea, if the range was too tight, there would be a possibility of more false breaks. So your may be right. It's good to have a fixed rule, anyway. Yep, I'm in the trade now. Now, I'll be busy. I have to use my psychic force to move the price in my favor! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Cprao You got it! (dont worry I also got/get confused about the Fixed swing highs/lows.) If we keep posting charts then we all learn. I generally use a fixed TP (Take Profit) and a fixed SL (Stop Loss). With a R:R (risk:reward) of 1:1. From the previous trade, the risk (SL) was 33 pips, so the reward (TP) was also 33 pips. Hope that helps, if not, please ask again. M

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Far East Man, Will help, by willing the the GBP to strengthen Pips for all M

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you M, You know what? I'll keep testing this method for at least two weeks or so, so that the folks here can get a general idea about what you can expect with this system. I'm not sure what we get after a certain period of time, but even if we found the system was a loser (we are not sure for now), my attempt would be just a different shape of contribusion to the folks here as we will be able to eliminate a bad timeframe to use with this system. And, even if my 1H trading was a loser after all, we still have your 5M trading style. So let's keep things rolling, buddy.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
My long position opened yesterday on GBP/USD 1H chart has hit the SL. And at the same time, a new short position is opened. Here is my new short position: Sell@1.51775 (manual entry) SL@1.53272 Please note, it happened so fast that the price penetrated the trigger line before I set the sell stop order. So I mannually entered short at 1.51775. Here is the chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I try not to think about which way the price heads towards.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hello Far East Man, So your SL is around 150 pips? isn't it too much? Cheers. P.S. I also have sell GU triggered. Here is what I have 1H tf trades Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi all Here is my set up for this morning. Swing high @ 1.5236 Buy trigger 1.5241 TP 1.5274 SL 1.5209 (Risk 32 pips) Swing Low @ 1.5210 Sell trigger 1.5209 TP 1.5177 SL 1.5241 (Risk 32 pips) M

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi all, 2 hours later and both triggers were opened and closed. Buy- SL hit -32pips Sell- TP hit +32pips Todays result 0 pips Total net pips- +49 pips Have a great day all. M P.S Just had a closer look at the time on my chart, and I have realised that my buy was triggered before London open (@07h59), So the learn for the day is to wait for 08h00, and then to place orders. (If I had done this then today would've been a +ve day!)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Far East Man, I agree, if we both post results (you = 1hr, me = 5 min). Then we can judge which TF is better for trading the ZigZag. Hope you GBPUSD sell turns out +ve. Cheers Mate M

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Soondoock, I'm using a less than $500 account at Alpari UK, and it's a micro account. By opening only 0.01 lot, even the 150 pips loss is within 2% of the $500 account (about $10 loss). If you are interested, here's how I adjust my lot sizing . So if you use micro lots, you are free to trade any timeframe. Hope you have good results.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi, I´ll try posting my charts and results for the 1H as well, when I get some time in front of the computer at home. I wonder how you set your SL? Do you use the opposite high/low and then adjust it to the TM, as per the original rules for the 5M? I have tried EU and GU, and I think that EU may work sometimes, but in the long run GU will work much better. Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks, I understand. Cheers

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Archie, I'm currently using the opposite high/low as my initial stop, then adjust it along the TM (one step above/below). I'm very interested in placing the initial stop at the TM so that the risk reward ratio is better. I'm currently planning to keep a journal about the hypothetical results to see how trades with TM stop turns out. Actually, when the range is too wide, I'll either have to place the initial stop at TM or pass the given opportunity. Yes, I agree. EU fluctuates a lot, but in much less predictable manner than GU. I'm not saying EU is not a good pair to trade. Actually for some systems, EU is much better than others. But when you need continuous trends, then GU is better I think. Probably, this system needs trend continuation tendency, especially for the 1H method. For 5M, I guess EU and other pairs may be ok, and EU spread is generally tighter.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Additional notes about my money management: My lot sizing is like this; when I have to risk 150 pips, I open 0.01 lot, and when I have to risk 75 pips, I open 0.02 lot. See? The risk $ is the same for both trades. For some traders, 75 pips stop is much safer than 150 pips stop, but for me, the risk pips is not a serious issue as I always adjust my lot size to make it the same percentage of the existing account fund. So when I decided to risk 2% of my account, then I always risk 2% of my account fund regardless of the stop distance I take. My blog posting here may be helpful.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
but to be profitable you need at least 1:1 RR

--- 帖子 #102 ---
The original system doesn't set a solid SL and TP. So RR is variable with this system. Michael applied 1:1 RR on his own 5M trading.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes. You were right. Your long was triggerred before UK 8 AM. On my chart UK 8 Am candle is the swing high . In fact this buy would not have triggerred. It went almost 100 pips from the swing low.. I think we should try to see how do we increase the profit. In this case, you probably should have got atleast 1:2 , if not 1:3 R:R.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
M, Good Morning. Thank you.. So far .. so good.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi folks, I made a couple of mods to the zigzag indicator version posted by acerinvest to make it more conforming to my understanding of the rules. The horizontal lines drawn at the last swing high/low are now only drawn on the last *fixed* swing high/low. The original version drew a horizontal line from the most recent high/low even though it's not really closed yet. I also added a pip distance measurement for this last fixed swing high/low. We're trading a break of the high/low of this last closed swing, so knowing how long it is would be important for position sizing.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Far East Man, I work out my money management the same way. Well explained. Have you moved your SL on your sell trade yet? Thanks M

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi stevegee58, Great mod, thank you very much, makes life even easier. Will be using it from now on. M

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi, The original tread starter never set a TP, but rather suggested a trailing SL, with the idea of catching a long profitable. I choose to use a set TP and a set SL, with a R:R of 1:1. I will keep posting my results, to show a possible alternative to having a trailing SL. Goodluck to all M

--- 帖子 #109 ---
This is great, stevegee58! The best ZZ I've come across! Yep, that's the sound money management! I haven't moved my stop. I have to wait till the TM goes below the entry for at least two ledges. If I move my stop too early, it'll kill the potential profit. Now the situation on GU 1H looks no good. I try to treat it as a part of the game.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Great Update. I was having so much challenges with this moving horizontal lines.. With your new edition, I can expect to have a fixed horizontal lines based previous (before 8 AM UK time) swing high/lows, right ? Any idea when these lines will appear on the chart ? Right after 8 AM UK time. That would be nice..

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The horizontal lines aren't time dependent, they just line up with the last closed swing-high and -low. The currently forming swing (and current price) will be between them.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thank you for the update. Does that mean when new swing high/lows are formed, the previous swing high/low horizontal lines will get disappeared from the chart, right ? So at any time, I do see two horizontal lines of the very previous swing high/low, right ? Appreciate your update.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
If I understand correctly, yes there are only 2 horizontal lines on the chart at any time which line up with the most recent closed swing high/low. So as new highs and lows are formed, the horizontal lines will move ahead in time to track them.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thank you. I think we are on the same page. I will anyway add your indy shortly on my charts.. Will let you know if there are any questions. Once agian thank you for the update. It is a good enhancement.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
FYI...Here is the chart with the updated indicator.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Good morning all Here is my set up for today. Buy @ 1.5271 SL 1.5225 TP 1.5317 (Risk/Reward 46 pips). Sell @1.5225 SL 1.5271 TP 1.5179 (Risk/Reward 46pips). Lets see how the day unfolds M

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I have placed a short trigger on EUR/JPY 1H chart. Sell stop: 125.182 Stop loss: 126.200 I know that the most recent swing high is not fixed, but if the swing low is penetrated, then it will be fixed. If the price goes upward, I'll remove the sell trigger. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As for GU 1H trade, I currently have a short position still alive. There could be a possible long trade opportunity for GU, but I won't take it as there is a news event in an hour or so. Just leave the open position and see where it goes. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I have placed a sell trigger on GBP/JPY 1H chart, too. I really don't like opening multiple positions at a time ( the reason is posted in my blog ), especially when those pairs are somehow correlated. But I simply would like to find out which pair works better. I'm currently risking up to 2% of my account for single position. And if I open 3 positions at a time, that's 6% risk. But this tiny micro account is thoroughlyfor experiments. So that will be ok. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I really would like to stress that opening correlated 3 pairs like GU/GJ/EJ at a time is not really a smart thing to do MM-wise.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
A good exit method might be to apply the fib tool to the zigzag (blue and red lines), set a target of 2.62% level and at the same time trail the stop on the ledges of TM (one ledge before the last). If target hit, this would give us a 1.62:1 RR Chart attached.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
A scaling-out strategy might help this. For instance you could close half the initial position at some profit target and leave the rest to ride with the trailing stop. Another approach that might work is pyramiding (also known as "reverse scaling"). i.e. adding to a winning position as it moves in your favor. I personally don't like scaling in because you're adding to a losing position.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi all, Here is my result for todays setup. Buy hit SL--46 Pips Sell hit TP--46 Pips Today-- 0 Pips Net Pips to date +49pips. Seems to be plenty of double trades (both sell and buy trades). M

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Probably, you might want to think about cancelling other trade when one trade is triggrred. Since it is 15 min chart, based on the volatility of the pairs some pairs have lot of noise before they pick the direction. My 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi, just in Easter time i found this nice thread here. Was reading from beginning, and found out that this way of looking on the market can help me on my trading method. My trading system is to trade on HH,HL,LH,LL. So, sometime it is not easy to find these areas, but with this ZZ i found nice way to manage my trading. I start it on small time frame 5min, as i can be near my comp almost all day from London to Ny close. But it all practising on demo. When i look on 1h its looks even better. Not saying hop before jump over, but looks promising if i use trend begining, confirmed by ZZ. I am not jumping in a trade on a brake ZZ, i am trying to find some LH or HL forming in ZZ channel and then put my order. Thats give me smaller sl on 1h, and most of the time when ZZ is broken price coming back for retest that level and even chage direction to previous trend, in this case i have possibility to set my sl on BE to see, how the things will play out. Hope join your discussion and share some charts from me too.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Here is two my trades, one is fine other not. I have put note on charts. P.S. eur/jpy i have sold (short) and aud/usd i bought (long).

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi dzero, I always wanted to enter with smaller SL, but the thing is when you enter closer to the ZZ pivot, the ZZ pivot is not fixed. I have been considering laying out two ZZs on a chart, one with bigger numbers like 13, 5,5, the other with smaller numbers 3,3,3, so that I can trade smaller ZZ inside the larger ZZ. Although it looks interesting in hindsight, I'm not sure if it's practical. My idea is when the direction of the breakouts of two ZZs lines up, you enter the trade with the SL of smaller ZZ. This way, you can get more opportunities with much better SL. When the bigger ZZ consolidates you'll would be in trouble. So I'm really not sure if it works in a long run.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Welcome dzero. Just curious - How do you trade using HH,HL,LH,LL candel setup ? However, I guess it is good if we can use these setup for Sl purposes within the swing. Were both your trades are on 15 min chart, right ?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
If you look at a 1H chart by zooming out like this, you may notice that the smaller the range the better the RR would be. Below is a 1H EUR/JPY chart. So I think it's a good idea to pick a range about 100 pips or less. If you pick a big range, then you may have hard time recovering from losses. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Modified the stop on EJ 1H. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Morning, So, as i mentioned that aud/usd is not nice, so where stop out. Far East Man, When i put my order in to the market there was fixed ZZ, only after brake of lower ZZ it change to smaller one, the previous high on ZZ i draw on chart manually. Of course this setup was far away from what i would be satisfy, but that is just example. You where thinking of putting other ZZ, i dont know but for me it is also late signal. The best, i think is candle formation and on top nice looking candle brake is more better. It can be pin, dark cloud, or any which you use to find some high probability to change direction. cprao I attached one simple example of trend, and how it can change in any time, that the reason i am trying to get in in to trade in first first confirmed LH or HL. And now with this fixed ZZ, thanks to stevegee58 for making nice update on ZZ, i can clearly see tops, HH,LL,LH,HL. So, you can trade them on two ways, first how it is describe in this topic from beginning on brake each new highs/lows or you can go in to the market when candle forms some HL or LH. Hope it can help. Both charts where on 1H.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Morning all, So it is 07h50 UK time, I open my charts to place my orders and this is what I see. So what to do?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Morning cprao, The problem is if I cancel the one order after the first order is triggered then I would end up with a loss. At least now with both orders being triggered I end up break even (Just end up paying the broker for the spread- but that doesn't change my P/L) M

--- 帖子 #132 ---
The best way to wait for new confirm of ZZ, and then put your orders. Chanel is to small in my option

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The range is big. But my concern is there will be two major UK-related news events. If you want to do it 100% mechanically, you have no choice but flip the coin. If the news outcome gives a massive boost, there would be a chance to fill either side of the profit targets, but it would be a bit riskier. With that said, honestly, if I were you I won't take it today. If you are on a demo or a tiny experimental account like mine, anything would be ok. You can even learn from losses if it turned out to be a loser.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi dzero, Yes, candle formations are sometimes very powerful, but they are, at the same time, highly dependent upon personal recognition. But, yea, if you use them as an additional confirmation in relation to other indicators or price actions, they could work.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Here is my setup for today. Swing High @ 1.5201 Buy @1.5206 TP 1.5239 SL 1.5173 (Risk/Reward 33 pips) Swing Low @ 1.5174 Sell @ 1.5173 TP 1.5140 SL 1.5206 (Risk/Reward 33pips) Today's orders are not exactly according to the rules. I chose the Swing High because there was clear rejection of 1.5200, and I chose the Swing Low because it was the low for the day and the low of Frankfurt open. Time will tell. M Edit--- Sell order triggered while writing this.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I like your decision, M. Now the downward momentum is massive. So it could work out! I pray for you.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Of course, candle location, why it stops, if there was some sup/res level. Very often nice formation is on brake ZZ, by confirming that as new res/sup level after brake. I am trying to look on as much as possible reasons to open trade.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Far East Man, I forgot to check the news releases-- However the sell order has been triggered so will let the day play out. As you can see from the chart I posted I have used different SH and SL. A risky move, however trading is risky. Hope your 1hr sells are going well. M

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi M I also agree that decision is right. Trending down really nice this London open.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi all, Just check the News- there is 7 bits of news out today for GBP and a couple for USD!! So I have cancelled my buy order and covered my sell order @ BE +1. Good luck to all M

Typical situation, retest brake aria and continuous forward down.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
just a simple question... do u use "crow" pattern with zigzag ? quite effective crows strategy...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
mistersimple, I've actually been frequently checking your thread recently. Really impressive work! I would love to try your method. Could you tell me what the crow is?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Mistersimple, Must be honest- never heard of the 'crow' pattern. Could you tell us more M

--- 帖子 #146 ---
thanks. however my posts were not about crows (even if i use it very much) im sure you know it.. basically you can call it how you want XYZ or butterfly (you can find some butterflies.. but a pure crow with 61.8% retracement is not a butterfly or gartley...) first chart i put long zigzag.. to better see .. you see the blue lines.. you have like a light drawn (or "4" ) ..just connect two extreme points.. you got your crow with tail, head and beak.. from legs to head must be 61.8% of tail to legs distance.. (normally..but u see on other charts it's not the case)... now the red horizontal line will be my entry.. normally it should retrace to the head level.. or even to the tail.. these wld be your take profits.. as an option you can use tail to head distance ...for expected take profit.. some people add andrews fork and a trendline (see chart 2 ) to have a buying zone (here in white).. it's more conservative... now on 3rd chart you see long zigzags and on 4th chart (short) normal zigzags.. you see how many opportunities.. you can try it on any timeframes..i recommend m15,m30,h1 (i didnt try it on lower tfs.. geometrical trading is VERY effective trading pls if you have questions ask..

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thank you very much for the details, mistersimple! Now as you can see on the chart below, GBP/JPY 1H seems to be the perfect crow setting. Attached Image (click to enlarge) How or where would you enter the trade? Upon the touch of the extreme line and the beak? Where would you place the stop? Sorry, but it's late at night in my local time and I go to sleep now, but will definitely check your reply later. Thanks for your willingness to help!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Thank you. Oh.. Yeah.. helps.. Provides another prospective to look at the pattern to determine the possible trade. Thank you for the explanation.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I guess.. wait and until second set of horizontal lines forms..

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I agree with you.. But it might urn out that you may get lost on both the orders. I guess, this may be the problem in 15 min charts on volatile pairs.. they swing violently before picking a trend.. on top of it.. currently GBP seems undecided..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Far East Man and mistersimple, On this chart would you be looking to buy (the bounce and aiming for the 61.8 level) or would you be looking to sell the break down? Thanks to you both, this seems to have sparked a whole new way of trading the ZigZag!! M

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Has anyone been using, or backtested this method during the US Session? I live on the west coast of the US, so the London Session is very late. When ever I put the zigzag indicator on my chart I end up with a very large range (over 300pips) ... Is this due to the time of day or am I setting something up wrong? Thanks

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi Aithin I have not tried it in the US session&gt; but I think it works well for London session because the GBPUSD is only traded lightly outside the London session, and at London open there is an increase in orders, volatility, momentum etc etc which works in our favour. You can perhaps try it trading the EURUSD and let us know how it goes... I would check your settings, they should be 13,5,5. Goodluck M

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thanks M for the speedy reply. My settings are currently 13,5,5 ... though I'll check them again when i get home tonight. I will also take a look at the EURUSD and see how it looks. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #155 ---
yes sorry for late answer .. yes its a very good setup see the bounce.. entry was at the red line (i dont use the fork) now we could lock in some profit (61.8%) we'll see where it will go.. to 100% ?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
eurgbp h4 strong bullish setup.. buy stop 8767 ...at least +90 pips potential...

--- 帖子 #157 ---
here is EU 1 min looks not bad! didnt try yet live though... sorry if it doesnt meet the thread's idea..

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks mistersimple, It's looking good. I'm currently shorting GJ, so not good for me though. But that's ok. I'm in a process of finding a way. So it's always good to have interesting ideas. My EJ took 97 pips profit (RR almost 1:1). My GU and GJ shorts are currently in jeopardy. But I've found that, on 1H charts, if you take a swing range less than 110 pips, life is easier RR-wise.

there is nice bearish butterfly on GJ (M30)=&gt; possible move to 141.82

Good Morning All, Here is my trade set up for today. Note: Again not exactly according to the rules. I chose the SH @ 1.5311 because after London open there was a break of 1.5300, followed by a retest.(Blue oval- can be seen better on a 15min chart). Buy @ 1.5316 TP 1.5367 SL 1.5265 (Risk/Reward 51pips) Sell @ 1.5265 TP 1.5214 SL 1.5316 (Risk/Reward 51pips) TWT Thanks M

Hi Mistersimple Would this count as a crow? (If it is-then my buy is in real danger!! ) Thanks M

--- 帖子 #162 ---
i looked at m30 there re only bullish candles..when bearish one appears.. we can look for a crow..

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi again, So I am done for the day. TP on buy was hit Pips for today 51 Pips Net Pips to date 101 Pips Have a great weekend all M

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Thanks for your reply- just looked at 30min chart, and I understand. Thank you for your response and teachings, it is great to learn something totally new. M

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Congrats MichaelSA, nice and quick done.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Congrats M! mistersimple, the GJ 1H crow setting hit the TP beautifully. What an amazing prediction! My GU and GJ turned out to be losers. I won't take big swing again.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
GJ h1 there is bat pattern setting up =&gt; i put sell stop at 143.63 =&gt; hope it will work out..TGT at least 143.10 GC h4 crow in preparation =&gt; ss @ 1.6365 TGT at least 1.6212 btw USDCAD worked nice today =&gt; there was an awesome inver. butterfly... (starting April 7, at 0.9911 finishing today before the huge spike) i dont know if its my computer or the broker.. but since i m using this geometrical things my MT4 is freezing...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hello ,mister Simple I am impressed with your style. If you can explain the these M1 chart trades one after the other I will really appreciate it. Where exactly are the entries stop loss? Thanks

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hey Paulus, If you are into zig zags you may like this indicator with built in A pitchfork and fibos.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Dzero, Far East Man Thanks for the congrats. This style of trading is far less stressful than how I use to trade, and far more simple. Far East Man&gt; sorry to hear about your losses, hopefully next week brings in some +ve pips. M

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Yes, you are right, about stress free trade. Main thing is that you follow your rules, after setting your positions not doing any corrections or some next trades. Wish you even better results next week, have nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hi mistersimple, Would this classify as a Crow? It is on a weekly chart, with a possible TP of 1.5900?? A good 500 pips (WOW!!) Thanks, just trying to learn (If you could post some charts of what you see when you place the trade and when you close the trade-- that would be brilliant!!) Are your ZigZag settings 13,5,5? M

--- 帖子 #173 ---
You are very right-----for me, the hardest thing in trading is sitting on your hands and letting the trade unfold. (I have closed far to many trades early, only to see it reach my original TP 15/30 minutes later!!) M

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hello Rasta, how would you use these pitch forks and fibos? Thanks

--- 帖子 #175 ---
yes.. a perfect one.. ye 1.59 is a minimum..but you could wait months before that...normally could go to 1.6970 .. lol let's see in 3 months? i never tried with weekly..but could work... ok i will post this week end.. my zigzag 12 3 5 if you want more use the following indicators... ZUP 64 is a bit complicated ... i got more elaborated korHarmonics (i dont know if you re interested in harmonic trading).. but i think a simple Zigzag + zigzag_new_nen would be enough.. BTW , rasta posted an awesome zigzag you can use it as well ! thanks ! i will include it to charts.. have a nice week end

--- 帖子 #176 ---
if i use fork=&gt; my entry between center and right (lower) fork line (on the rasta's chart) ..for conservative =&gt; entry under right (lower) fork line... but as you get used to it u dont need a fork...the most important are fibs

--- 帖子 #177 ---
ok tomorrow

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi, Thanks- Yip, I agree lets see what happens over the next couple of weeks/months I could be very interested in Harmonic trading if its anything like the crow. I had a look at it awhile ago (either on a FF thread or somewhere else), but it did get a little confusing (gartleys, diamonds, butterflies, etc). Thanks for the indicators, I will have a look at them over the weekend. Enjoy the weekend, M

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thanks, M. I'm fine, really! Entering upon fixed zigzag was seemingly easy when I started reading this thread because many pairs were nicely trending at that time, so I took those positions without being selective. Only in hindsight, taking those bigger swing breakouts was not good. They might or might not have work, but you wouldn't have gotten a good RR either way. That might be a silent killer of your account. But you know, you are doing great and getting constant results with 5M. That's really a good news to everybody here. And we got some more nice methods and indies to try out here. So let's keep things rolling.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Trying to catch up where I left off previously. Amazed to see new strategies (new for me) to this zigzag thread. I am sorry, I still didn't understand this fork concept here. what is/are the forklines in the chart and what are they trying to convey to a trader to take a position ? Also didn't understand the crow concept.. probably has to re-read the previous post again carefully.. Does this crow concept needs constant attention to the charts ? Are they successful on daily charts and easy to identify ?

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Is this crow setup ? if yes, 1)When "beak" can be identified ? Is there a way to avoid false identification ? 2) When the potential area is idenfied how to enter a position ? Any confirmation strategy ? Andrew pitchforks ? how to use them ? 3) TP is generally upto head ? Can you please answer these questions ?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hey, FAREAST man. I am also in Japan, Yokohama. Hard to find good MT4 brokers here, in this country. You find any domestic brokers? I have one but the spread is not fixed and can get a little unreasonable at times.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thank you for the encouragement, it still early days, hopefully the month will turn out +ve. I agree, lets keep things rolling. When I get a chance this weekend I will have a look at the indies mistersimple kindly posted. Otherwise there is still next to week to look forward to!! M

--- 帖子 #184 ---
He he he, I'm an hour away from you. I'm in Fujisawa. My favorite broker is Alpari UK. They now accept credit card deposit, and I feel quite comfortable with them. Funny we communicate in English. I know that brokers' services battle in Japan is so heated up that they offer crazy spreads like 1 pip on UJ and EU, and about 3 pip on GJ. However, since MT4 brokers are not many in Japan, those MT4 brokers might not offer very competitive spreads, I guess. All I need is MT4 with micro lots. So Alpari UK is pretty much ok to me. And I'm not very interested in looking for one in Japan as Japanese government has decided to impose stupid leverage regulation. Although I'm quite deciplined and don't trade with unrealistically high leverage, I really don't like such restriction. You don't need such baby sitting. They are not protecting traders's interests. They are actually curbing it. Hope you find a good broker, mate! Cheers,

--- 帖子 #185 ---
YES 1) when price move higher (in this case) ..end of zigzag is hard to identify..maybe you could use macd or any other indicator.. so just wait price bounce.. 2)see charts..no confirmation.. see charts.... 3) generally yes, i would advise secure half the "upto head" distance... OK here is AU M30 entries magenta color SL red ( under/above 123 fib level) TPs white btw, 2 vertical red lines show you how much time you have to wait before new pattern complete.. between em you can go long at breakout of high (green line) GU daily 2 charts with zigzag_nen and normal zigzag... same rules.. see how much you have to wait?! 6 months! on the 2nd chart you got explanation 1st is not a real crow (i dont know what it is.. but for gartleys you have a good explanation on investopedia...) inverse for bullish crows.. 2nd bearish, 3rd bearish OK 4th bullish ok 5th bullish not ok (however retraced to half.. see it's purely at your own discretion ..) 6th bullish ok last chart pitchfork: its like if you break a channel =&gt; for bullish crow ..breaking the upper line would be your entry... ill post tonight m1 charts

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thank you mistersimple. I appreciate your effort. To be honest with you - I am very much confused with AU30 chart because of so many crows.. its just me.. I am a easily confused person. What I still understand what makes us to think BEAK has formed. if I look at GU daily (last chart) I see a similar beak setup between 1.6021 and 1.6285. I think it takes me a while to understand this crow setup.. Thnak you very much for your help. By the way, I think I understand andrew pitchfork . As you said, it is kind of breaking the trend line drawn from the greatest swing high. I still didn't make it out how to determine aggreesive buy zone. One thing is sure - you really made it look like very simple - speaks a lot of about your expertize on this setup.. Thank you for your effort..

--- 帖子 #187 ---
np i found some pics somewhere.. maybe this will show better

--- 帖子 #188 ---
here is for m1 (with zigzag_nen and normal zigzag) on 2nd chart: 1st is a clear butterfly 2nd is a risky pattern if entered ..we r stopped out.. 3rd good one: 3 possible exits..

--- 帖子 #189 ---
You sound like another fellow Brit. LoL Yeah, I hear you about the MT4 brokers here. The one I am currently using is not so bad and they have micro lots, spread on UJ can go from 1-3 pips though. I suppose I can live with that for now. It is this one. No English though! http://jp.forex.com/jp

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Thank you.. I think, I probably can identify the patterns when they are all done.. but I don't I can still make it out while they are : 1) Forming 2) ensuring it is the right 3) Identify differrent profit targets.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I didn't get why that was a wrong setup ?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I see there are two Fibo's .. one is static and the other is Dynamic ? whats the differrence between these two ?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Also does Andre'w pitchform indy helps identify crow setup ?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
on 1st m1 chart beak is on same level as legs is this what you are talkin about?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi mistersimple, Thank you for your all your input, it is really appreciated. I will try this week to see if I can spot a crow as it is happening, and post it for comment. Using a Zigzag (12, 3, 5) and a Zigzag new nen (21, 13, 34) and compare that to using a Zigzag (13, 5, 5- what I am currently using). M

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Good Morning M. How do you plan to compare these various ZIGZAG setups ? Are you putting all on ONE chart and comparing them ?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Yes. Now I see it.. Is there a a specific length beak has to be from Leg ? For ex - head is 65% of tail and leg, right ? In the same way is there a % for the beak from leg ? I think identifying beak is very important because the trading potential starts from this point only.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Good Morning cprao (Well its still Sunday evening here) At this stage its just a visual comparison. So have two charts (one on top of the other). Still thinking about how to trade the 2 'set ups' though, because I have been using the ZigZag to trade the breakout, whereas the ZigZag with ZigZag new nen is more a bounce/reversal trade. Will follow them as the week progresses. M PS The 12,3,5 setting on the ZigZag seems to be more 'sensitive', will keep my eye on it!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
if we take a crow looking down (beak down) "normally" leg-to-head=61.8% of tail-to-leg head-to-beak = 161.8% leg-to-head ------------------------------ so doing maths =&gt; we got head-to-beak : 61.8%x161.8% of tail-to-leg =&gt; almost equal to tail-to-leg =&gt; could help to identify beak.. but it's not always like that.. only for a "good" setup. (eg GJ H1 you cant miss it from April5 13:00 GMT to April8 07:00 GMT ) PS u got these figures if u use ZUP indicator..

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thank you for the info, Rastaman! Hmmmm.... I had never noticed this broker. Looks ok to me, too. By the way, did anyone take EU long somewhere? I love double tops and bottoms. And I love taking it in the middle where the W is still under developement. Nothing to do with this thread, though. Although the formation is really conventional and nothing is new, it's really easy to identify and works fairly fine. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Yes. This definitley helps in identifying beak.. So Once we identified tail, leg and head.. we can start looking for the formation on beak. Do you expect some consolidation at beak ? Also, I believe you mentioned this setup can be applied to any pair, right ? best timeframe are 30 Min and above.. PS: I have not used ZUP indicator yet.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
GM all, In my quest to conquer the Crow, here is what I think is a crow formation on a GBPUSD 4hour chart 12 April. Any comments... M

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Here are my orders for today, Not too happy about the risk/reward = 86 pips M

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi all, and wish you all good week! MichaelSA, that's really interesting that our ZZ are different on 5m time frame. Look what i have, and only 59 pips.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi M, The initial retracement (the leg to the head) may be a bit too shallow, I guess. According to mistersimple, it has to be around 61.8. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...227018&amp;page=10 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=199 Cheers,

--- 帖子 #206 ---
it will work anyway.. important is beak above legs in this case (GU 4h) it already corrected.. so at least to 1.5275 =&gt; and if move further down =&gt; 1.5149

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi Cprao, Your ZigZag seems to be more sensitive- are you still using 13,5,5 setting or have you changed it to 12,3,5 (as said by mistersimple)? Did you trade your set up this morning? M

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Far East Man, Great start to the week, congrats. Let us know how it ends M

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi all, The sell order from this morning is still open, and the day is pretty much over. So I have moved the SL to BE +1 and cancelled the buy order. Time will tell how the trade unfolds. M

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes, my settings are 13,5,5. I didn't trade this set up, as i was not sure how this big gap will play out. So i am waiting tomorrow morning to see possibility to get in.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
M, Mi zigzag is 13,5,5.. no I have not traded today ..

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Morning all, Woke up this morning to find my trade from yesterday still open. So I made a decision to close it @ +25Pips Net Pips to date = 126Pips M Edit- Maybe I should have left it open- there is a clear rejection of 1.5400 at Frankfurt Open

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi dzero, Just saw that you put up the chart for comparison, sorry. If our settings are the same, I wonder why the ZZ is different? Maybe down to the broker? M

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Morning all, Here are my trades for today. Risk/Reward 62 pips. M

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi Michael I think that it can be on that big gap which we had on market opening, and there can be some data feed difference. Today I am already in GBP/USD long, lets see if I am to early, because lasts ZZ formed just 10 minutes after London open and I open on previous ZZ, and put a new pending to buy on brake new ZZ.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi dzero, Could you post a chart? Thanks M

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi all, The buy order was triggered and is currently sitting at about +25pips. I have moved my SL to BE +1pip (1.5398), TP still 1.5461 and cancelled my sell order, as I am going on a business trip now and will only be back on Thursday GL all M

--- 帖子 #218 ---
so, here you have my trade plan and how i manage today's trade.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi, Thanks. GL to us all M

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Close last buy with small profit, brake was not as strong as expected, rest SL place under present ZZ highs.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
All position closed by sl. But day was good enough with some nice % gain.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
You guys going well it seems Ive been looking slightly differently Im trying to narrow down the profitable trades whilst cutting back on draw down My ZZ is set to 353 gives smaller zigzags and coupled with TM better entry 3 charts below 1 shows trades on the 1hour EURUSD 2nd chart a more detailed explanation of the set up..the 3rd chart 'where we are now' If the trade doesnt go our way when we hit an important technical point we close at zero.If it goes we use TM to give us some good pips. On the 1hour chart since 26th march ( 15 trading days ) only 5 signals but results are good +120+0+0+95+225 a gain of roughly 30 pips a trading day but gained over 5 trades and now waiting for a short The set up shown on 2nd chart a. TM goes from blue to red so we are looking for longs b. Price breaks the last fixed high at b c. The price touches the TM line ( this can be set as a lmt buy) d. When price reaches this green line which is last ZZ high we move stop to break even as it could reverse here e. f.g.h all stops moves with TM we get taken out at h. The 3rd chart a. TM red we are looking for shorts b. Price breaks last fixed ZZ low c. We wait for rally and a touch of the TM for a short entry. Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Glad you are back. Where do you place the initial stop, below/above TM or below/above last swing?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
of late 1pip above below swing hi lo cheers P

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thanks what are your ZZ settings on 1hr? They are not 13-5-5 as on 5min.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
good point should of mentioned will alter my post they are on the 353 setting to get a smaller ZZ and better entry as Im using TM for direction and trigger P

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi Paulus, May i ask? From your examples i understand that you trade touch trades on TM for direction, or waiting for some candle confirmation? Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
no just the touch but abc in the setup has to fall in place currently short from 1.36.12 P

--- 帖子 #229 ---
The above trade failed ..the trade had to be closed out as TM went blue indicating I will be looking for longs the loss was only a few pips Paulus

--- 帖子 #230 ---
That's because you kept it tight.

--- 帖子 #231 ---

--- 帖子 #239 ---
hi mistersimple do you still use korharmonics or zup indictors? i use them,but i find i can not get accuracy enty.maybe other indicators can filter false signal.i hope you can give me some advices. yourspace

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi guys, I like Zig Zag and I love scalping the 5min charts. I use it in combo with TOP TREND and Heikin Ashi. Basically, when TOP TREND is showing an uptrend, I wait for a ZZ down trend line to print. This is when I start paying attention. Once heikin Ashi signals a price reversal BACK UP in line with the TOP TREND, I go Long. I place my stop just below the most recent low and exit when the ZZ up trendline prints. Essentially, I am buying low and selling high in an uptrend (as shown by the TOP TREND indicator). Makes sense huh. Apply the opposite rules when going short. It's easy, mechanical and profitable. Phil

--- 帖子 #247 ---
good entry point !! now I'm trying implement ZigZag with other indicator as well.. keep up a good work, brother

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello Paulus, I am testing this method on m15, please tell me do u follow any filter for the breakout direction or you just take any side breakout when happens first?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi Sorry put a e ema on your chart only trade when ema breaks ZZ not price you get in slightly later but you do avoid loads of false signals cheers paul

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thanx for your reply Paulus. but please tell me what EMA do u suggest or using? How do u calculate your profit targets or you just trail with trend magic line? Why your thread is dyeing, i have been using 1-2-3 method also so i know this type of method has a lot of potential. Keep it alive

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Pip the ema is a 3 period ZZ is a good system and will produce profit ..I use TM to act as my sliding stop but to be honest I like getting in sooner..some times I have some times been in and out of the same move before the ZZ is broken I have various systems and keeping threads alive takes alot of time.. But I do have it on my workstation always cheers p

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I am using it with fibonacci expansion for profit targets. Anyhow thanx for your help. I hope to get more guideline from you. Your private message option is now open???

That's okay Paulus, but can u keep posting your trades daily? it will be more to learn from your chart setups. Here is my today trade with Gbp/Jpy during london session. I entered at the opening of arrow marked candle when 3 EMA is already below ZZ Low line. currently my stop loss is just 5 pips above Trend magic.

Hi All, Can somebody explain what's the meaning for ZigZag indicator setting: ExtDepth ExtDeviation ExtBackstep Thanks.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
That's exactly what I would ask in the first place, before trading and developing a method based on an indicator. Still haven't found a decent source for my additional question: WHEN (which conditions have to occur) does the zigzag indicator plot a new direction? This is by far the most important question if you want to perform a visual backtest and don't want to waste time with a trade simulator. Is there someone out there who could help with this? Thanks in advance. Attached a similiar indicator, with simpler settings. But still, everytime I believed to finally have figured it out - suprise arise and I scratch my head. Please help

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Wondering if you could put an audio/popup alarm on your indicator when price touches the support and resistance line?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi, is it that there is someone who could modified the QTA indicator and put a "Short" alarm when the zigzag in the QTA reach the (Higher High) HH_0.618, HH_1.618 or HH_2.618 and put a red line in the indicator. And when the zigzag in the QTA reach the (Lower Low) LL_0.618, LL_1.618 or LL_2.618, we put a green line in the indicator for a "Buy" signal. The alarm is only the read or green line in the indicator. I have put a exemple of what i want. If we add the 3 Level ZZ Semafor in the same time, we have a potential reverse Thank you, Benoit

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Still somebody using that method ?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Probably because it looks pretty solid. Why not back or forward test it and post your results?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I'm currently busy setting up an EA for it. (with ZZ + MA).

Is this System still working?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
These is the only thing that work in a long run . Which is not the first time revealed by these thread nor in the FX industry . What ever you want to see if you can see it , is there . Even when the market , yes , when the market crap . From simple ZZ strategy it can be expand to unlimited knowlages to the market . Wise word do not attempt to follow the zz it self or try to build the new breed , it all come to the same point , from the person before you or sit the guy sit next to you , there is a time these strategy or the new breed will outed any body who use it unconditionly . These statement valid to those who floored the bar , with no reservation needed . Good luck for your new endeavor , K

In my EA, I would like to remove the Zigzag indicator after it is loaded and used one time. Could anybody tell me how to remove the zigzag indicator in EA since it seemed CPU consuming. Thanks.

Hello lhDT could you share your EA some ware here, please can you give a link I do not find searching under FF Thanks And Regards, Moti

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Guys, sorry to see this thread slow down. I wonder if it is because it was getting too complicated and people were too keen to get it automated? I have posted here because i am not suggesting that i bring something new to the current author and therefore do not justify a new thread. I have been having some success just stripping this strategy back to basics: SETUP 4 x Pairs (E/U, G/U, Aud/U &amp; U/J M_5 TF (I use higher tfs to look for Sup/Res and exits) Entry I only enter a trade from 15 minutes after a trading session opens. I am based in the UK so for me I trade 15 minutes after London and NY open for 4 hours. The light green shaded part of my charts reminds me of this. Only join a trade when you see the first arrow in a new direction (ie previous arrow was in the opposite direction). Do not join an existing run of arrows. Long - Large Red arrow above candle. Trend Magic line Blue and climbing from horizontal (you may have to wait a couple of extra candles/arrows before this happens). Short - Large Green arrow below candle. T.M. line Red and falling from horizontal (you may have to wait a couple of extra candles/arrows before this happens). Exit/TP TP size should relate to the TF you trade. Higher TF= longer TP etc. I trade M_5 tf and look for roughly 10 pips. If the trade looks solid I then close 50% of the position at TP, move the SL to BE and let the rest run. If closing only half the position I then often use the trend magic horizontal line as a trailing stop, keeping two horizontals back from current PA. If PA has been choppy I exit the whole position at TP. I may also exit if no real movement takes place within 3-4 candles of entry. SL SL size varies. I work on keeping to two principals 1. SL should be technical not random. 2. Risk/Reward should be as close to 1:1 as possible (or better). So I am typically looking for a logical Sl placement about 10 pips back from entry on M_5 tf. I will use a previous Hi/Lo or when the Trend Magic line was last horizontal. If this is more than 10 pips away i tend to use it anyway but extend by TP to achieve 1:1 R/R. I may not take the trade if I can't find a suitable SL around the 10-20 pip mark. I will post some example trades to help understanding but you will see that this is really simple.

here is a recent example of a wonderful trade on the Euro. Sadly they are not all like this but it does demonstrate the setup well The yellow arrow, to the left of entry, was the first indicator (previous arrow to that was red). We then had to wait a couple of candles until the horizontal Trend Magic line was red and dropped. This was entry. Sl was above the previous Trend Magic horizontal. As this was 16 pips away I adjusted my TP to 16 pips (1:1 R/R): Attached Image (click to enlarge) On this trade because TP had been hit cleanly with each candle closing near the low of that candle i kept 50% of the trade in after hitting TP for what turned out to be an additional 18 pips. On this occasion I exited then because of the 2 x weak bottom candles followed by 2 x clean green candles.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Another simple example in the Aud/U: Attached Image (click to enlarge) if I had used the lower horizontal line as my SL I would have achieved more pips as my TP would have been higher but still hit!

Hi Never used this indi before and at the risk of sounding stupid what are the yellow and orange arrows for on the above chart. also could you explain the entry point as on the above chart your entry point is a long way from the last green up arrow are along way

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Shoot2Scoot's post#266 covers this ...and the arrows are just a different visual on the standard ZigZag indicator.

A quiet day today. I stayed out of the market once the ECB QE news was out. E -12 G A +14, +10 J

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Summary for today net +29 pips. Again I did not trade the NY session because of the ECB Press Conference E +19, G Aud +10 J

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi shoot2scoot, Im not sure I understood this part of your explanation right, Do you mean you only a move, indicated by a red/green arrow only once, and never re-enter? Best ihezzz

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi ihezzzz, I only join a trade if the previous arrows (to the current setup I am looking to join) were in the opposite direction. I do not join trades where arrows were indicating short but market then pulled back and then later continued short again. see chart as example: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks shoot, now I got it!

Doing a lot of research today on other strategies so these trades are just what i can see backtesting the day. I did not trade them myself . E +45, -19 G -18, +10 AUD -15, +10 J +10, +10, +10 NET 43 PIPS

should have stayed in bed today. not worth the effort! E -10, +10 G +10 AUD -15, +10, +10 J +10, -10 Net Total +20 pips

--- 帖子 #283 ---
netting 20/day consistently would do me fine

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Understood sidefx but look at the risk i took. It took 8 trades to achieve that and a couple nearly went the other way. I certainly could have used my time more productively today. I guess Monday and the Greek election played it's part. Perhaps I should have just stayed in bed.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
shoot, do these +20 pips include your spread or do you mean 20 pips minus 8xspread?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Good point ihezzz, they do include my spread. So I report net profit.

Got to smile. G/U went on to hit TP. just missed out by 1.5 pips on my SL. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the other hand AUD/U just went on to make up for it as just closed out at +30 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update: had to go out at short notice for the day. Any further trades will be recorded with the benefit of hindsight this evening. Good Trading.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi guys, I had a successfull one today on EU, but my entry is more aggressive than yours shoot, I enter on the break of the high and dont wait for the trendmagic to change its colour. I also use fix TP (12) and SL (10), because I feel better with a quick-in-quick-out approach, unless Im thinking about to change my strategy to a trailing stop like you are doing. This time my result was a winner, +12 pips. EDIT: Today was a bad day. EU +12, AU -10, GU -10, net -8 and a missed second winner on EU

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi shoot Really like the look of your system and you seem to be having great success with it, just one thing I can't get my head around, In your first post you say that to enter long you wait for a red candle and to enter short, is this an error or am I losing the plot. Martin

--- 帖子 #292 ---
hi Martin, thanks for your kind words, however i am keen to point out that I am not the original author of this thread. Just felt i should post here in respect of the one with the real brains. Anyway back to your point. perhaps you are confusing Candle with Arrow? I can't see where I say long on a red candle (and if I do I am wrong )? Good luck

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Afternoon trading could have netted you: E +10 G A +10, +10 J +10 Just a reminder that I didn't trade these this afternoon as I was away today

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Shoot Yes I meant to say arrows not candles This is what I can't seem tpo get my head around thanks Martin

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Martin, I see what is confusing you. You need to trade counter-intuitively against the arrow direction. Look at some of the charts i have posted and you will see the direction I traded from the Entry, SL and TP. If it helps change the arrow colours as well as that might make things more logical (zigzag-pointerV2)? As they were not my Indis I never bothered.

I am stopping trading now as the markets seem to be jumping about a bit ahead of FOMC tonight. Net +33 pips today. +2.7% gain

--- 帖子 #307 ---
For future reference i intend to report my results slightly differently. like many, I risk just 1% of my bank in each trade. This means that most winning trades net me +1% of my bank (with this strategy). Talking in % gain of bank is far more meaningful than pips and it advocates good MM which i certainly believe in. so that is what I shall do in future. i hope you agree.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Good idea. Great to see your realtime/nr to realtime trades and charts. It all seems to be working well for you.

shoot2scoot - 12,5,3 is the standard format setting in mt4 for zigzag.

long on the G/U. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update: i am closing down 50% of this position if it hits the red line above as it is a resistance point and i want out to do other things. Remaining 50% hit TP. +0.75%

Just taken Euro short Attached Image (click to enlarge) Don't like the look of this trade but I will be faithful to the setup. Was right Sl hit.(the dotted line was a minor support line but it coincided with the 50% fib of the last move up and the euro historically really respect the 50% fib. can't win em all.......as I am proving.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Yes always a difficult one that - plan the trade and trade the plan. I don't like to trade against the daily candle nor be short if price above the daily open line but they are just my little quirks.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
With you handy but as you know very quickly we get into an over complicated strategy that never loses because it never trades! lol Cor wish i had stayed in the Aud. The other losses made me cautious. Down net -1.25% this morning.

-0.5% on cable. I had moved my sl up after initial move long. watch the market turn now and make me pay.

Short the yen still. UPDATE: May consider dumping this trade. It does look like a nice pennant setup but i am keen not to lose my current +0.5%. May give it a couple of more bars Attached Image (click to enlarge) Further Update: Glad i stayed in a little longer. Pennant broke out and hit TP. +1% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just long the cable. 3 trades in one morning in this pair that is chancing it! Update: sure enough it hit SL. -1% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Enough for the morning here is the summary: E 0 (missed a +1% trade) G -0.5%, +1%, -1% A 0 (sadly no short entry according to my rules) J +1% Net +0.5% not great but it is Friday. My trading may be light this afternoon.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Interestingly, the method mentioned in post 2 of this thread seems to work quite well even without the trend magic.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
oh ok handy what have you been finding?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I was short in EU, but now out at +4 pips, because the m1 indicated a reversal. Was the second trade today for me which ended up more or less at BE because TP was missed by 1 pip -.- EDIT: And TP would have been hit now. I really need to keep away from trades, I get scared to much and often get out too early -.- But at least it shows me, that my entries tend to work out. I should be a bit more faithful and trusting. If I had strictly like a machine followed my trading plan today, I would be at +3% now. So far +0,64% today

--- 帖子 #329 ---
That's a sentiment we can all relate to ihezzz. How many times after two quick losses do we miss out the next trade only to watch it fly to TP! Keeping the mindset that 'anything can happen' and 'i don't know what will happen' is critical and trusting a plan that is backtested is certainly more reliable than my spontaneous judgement! Good luck. lots of profit taking now before Advanced GDP!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Absolutely true shoot, from one point of view it's really interesting and fascinating, how the emotions try to take you over, trading is really a powerfull teacher in this respect. I will call it a day and stop trading now. The day finally resulted in +1,88% for me.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
very respectable. equates to +37% for the month! Have a great Weekend.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Thanks, you too!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
scoot2shoot - this was Paulus original idea to draw horizontal lines at the last 2 fixed zig zag points before London open and trade the break thereof.

Well we have woken to a beautiful snow covered morning in the UK. Just thought i would update you on my results since the 15th January. My bank has grown by +30% with this strategy alone. If you would like me to keep posting here some more participation on the thread would be good just to let me know that you are out there.

Just popped out to grab breakfast and it looks like I might have missed an entry long on Cable. I may still enter at a very preferential point with a much shorter SL? Done. See below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update . Already out having hit my altered TP +1%. Better not to be greedy. Just get the job done. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Long on Aud: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Dont like the way this pair is moving against other US crosses. Have moved SL to BE Update. out at BE Really difficult to trade any of the pairs right now as there is no pattern/trend on the M5 tf other than possibly the yen but there has not been an entry so far this morning there!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Another entry long for Aud: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Update: Just don't like the feel of the market right now. I have closed the Aud position (on reflection the early morning move there has probably affected all of todays trades). I have also entered long on cable but have also come out of that just above BE. Will look again this afternoon. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi shoot I'm still watching your trades, great work there, are you a full time trader? When you have an arrow and an arrow below I still struggle to understand what makes you trade in one direction and not the other? Martin

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Not sure i have your point Martin. Is it around why I don't join an existing set of arrows in one direction if i didn't get the first setup? Let me answer that question just in case it is: We are looking for momentum in a direction and looking to join it once established. that means that in a number of situations by the time we get an entry signal the momentum may well be starting to wain already (good for 10-15 pips but not necessarily a lot more). For this reason I only join the first setup. If the nature of the following candles is strong (i believe momentum is still there) I will only close 50% of my position at TP1, move SL to BE and let the remainder run a little longer. However in any trend we get pullbacks which break up the tidy move up or down. they are normally only profit taking and a pause before the trend continues (boy would i like to see a decent higher Tf trend right now!). My clue that the pull back has run out of steam and a new round of action in the trend direction is about to continue is to see an arrow form in the opposite direction to the trend. That is why I say I only start trading in the opposite direction to the previous arrow. Sorry bit verbose there. if I am still not explaining myself clearly do say....especially if i didn't answer your question. PS i am nearly full time and have been trading for 10 years+ PPS a lot of rules i setup for myself are about discipline more than catching the extra pip or two. I need rules for myself as i am prone to cheat if I don't have them.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Missed the euro trade long at 10 minutes after NYO. happened too fast for me.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thanks for your explanation, You must think I'm a real thicko, but for some reason I'm having real problems getting the logic of your trading. Let me see if I have this correct, if you get a green arrow you wait for a smaller arrow pointing down and then enter long when the trend magic is blue and vertical?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thankfully No Martin. . lets look at an example below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ok look for the numbers on the chart. No1. Here are a green and yellow arrow that never resulted in a short trade because the Trend magic line above remained blue and horizontal (not red and did not bend down). this potential trade did fulfill the primary requirement that the arrow before it was in the opposite direction (red arrow at No 2). Mmarket now reverses again in the opposite direction, long. To enter a long trade, again we need the previous arrows to be in the opposite direction, which they are (green and yellow arrows at No 1.). next we need new red/orange arrows to form and once they form we need the trend magic line to be blue and bending up from the horizontal, which it finally does when price reaches No 3. (see the bend in the trend magic line at No 4). Sl is below the previous horizontal trend magic line (at least 10 pips away or I go to the further horizontal ). TP is the same distance from entry as SL but in the opposite direction.

Nice trading! If you don't mind my asking, what average % return are you seeing now that you've been trading this live for a while (weekly &amp;/or monthly % returns)? You are inspiring me to get back into live trading again - i have around the same experience as yourself (12 years) and haven't live traded in earnest since 2008 when I lost a shed load through lack of discipline and being under-capitalised.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
High Side, I haven't been trading this strategy live for very long. i watched it and paper traded for three months last year and started live this year only. it is one of a range of strategies i trade which are typically always under review and going through some sort of turnover/modification. i should add that I have shared yur misfortune as well! Back to your question i have seen 20% a month paper trading but have so far seen more since, hitting 30% during the period of january that I have traded live. I do not expect that to continue! I believe that if you can achieve 10% a month with a strategy you are doing very well (that assumes that you only ever risk 1% in any trade).

Hi all very interesting Post i am on page 5 of 19 here and thought i would jump to the last page to see how active this system is. See as last post was feb 2015 I assume this system isn't working any more hence people are not using it? Also if anyone knows: 1) Which pairs have worked to date and which have failed? 2) which time frame has worked best? The above has not been mentioned in post #1. Thanks

Such a long shot you are still even on this site - but I'm trying to add an "automatic Fibonacci" to this ZigZag indicator - I have a version of it but adds the Fib to the current (most recent) ZZ leg - which changes of course, and makes the Fib pretty much useless. Any chance if you happen to see this you could add on to your ZigZag SG indicator? LOVE the SG, works tremendously well with what I am doing right now - but would love the automatic Fib to appear at the last FIXED swing Highs and Lows (Red and Blue lines) of this ZZ indicator. I'm working on it too, going through it line by line, but my programming skills are lacking - maybe I'll figure it out before you even see this. Thanks if you can do it!
