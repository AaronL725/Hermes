Here is my trading "system"! Simple and effective. Hope you like it. No Specific exit strategy. I exit my half lot at 1*Sl so that my trade becomes free. Then i let other half run with fast trailing of tight stop. I generally let PA guide me. if i see my side winning, i stay in longer. I also take profits when i reach may daily target of 40 pips. So i exit on variety of reasons. No indicators. I used them and didnt like them. I find more indicators less reliable. It all becomes confusing hell.

Price action momentum trading Background- I had been a successful trader in higher time frames (HTF, meaning 4h and above) using classical chart patterns like double top etc. However when I was forced to trade shorter time frames, I realized my earlier tricks don’t work anymore. I studied, learnt, tried and cried. Thankfully I found some success with dance ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=224697 ) now active as choros ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=236210 ) especially constrainment trades. But touch trades were a big pain for me. Either I missed them or lost money. I stayed awake whole nights and really wondered if short time frame trading was possible. But thankfully I didn’t give up. Then one day I read a post by kostas ( http://www.forexfactory.com/kostas1 ) and I had my aha moment. Price action!! PA!! That’s all to the game. I have been successful since then. Since I benefited greatly from generous experience and guidance of others in FF I am here sharing my system. Let me warn you it sounds too simple to be true, but it indeed is. Warning: This is work in progress. I am posting it only because of request from friends. Please give me time to make a better manual. A war- any market is a war- A war between buyers and sellers; A war between bears and bulls. All a trader has to decide who is winning and then join in when winning army starts its attack. Unfortunately there are no straight winners in this war. Territories are being won and lost every minute. Every tick is a small victory for one army and loss for another. Then how does one decide who is winning? Territory! Whoever captures more territory PER ATTACK is winning. That’s easy. But the problem is that even a winning army is not always fighting. They consolidate, take rest and let losing army capture few posts. And then they march ahead recapturing all lost posts and some more. It’s important to be with winning army just when they start their attack. At other times. even supporters of winning army can become causalities. This is precisely what I do. I see who is winning and join their march when they start their attack. I stay outside when winning army is taking rest or when losing army is making small gains. Territories- pips gained or lost per candle is key to finding out who is winning between buyers and sellers. If you see large bull candles bulls are winning. If you see large bear candles, bears are winning. If you see both none is winning- stay out. I just see large candles and join that force. It’s as simple as that. However, if you have been trading for some time you will recognize that large candles are in essence “impulsive moves”. But I don’t want to confuse anyone. Also by large candles, I mean “comparatively large candles”. Candles before a candle decide what’s large. Sometimes even candles after a candle will give clue that a candle was indeed large. The march- It’s critical to join winners only when they are gaining grounds. At other times there maybe causalities even in winner camp. How do we know when winners are not resting but marching ahead? When they gain new grounds and push back losers army! Yes it’s simple. Lets not make it complicated Summary- SO, When I see large bullish/ bearish “momentum” bars, I decide to join that side. Timing of joining is critical. I join only when I know my side is marching. When I am bullish I wait for price to go ABOVE previous candle high to enter. Breach of previous candle high is indication to me that bulls are fighting and not resting. Similarly when I want to sell, I wait for breach of previous candles low before joining the selling. This means my entries are always “stop loss” orders. Entry points- I love to enter the war at critical battles. When I know loss of a particular battle is going to crush the opposition that’s time to join in. I look for critical boundaries between bulls and bears. When I know loss of a particular boundary is going to result is major gains for winners then I join. My preferred entries- A. Rejection bars: They show that winning arming is pushing losing army back. As always, entry is above (buy) or below (sell) the pattern not at-market. B. Failed reversals: Early in the trend, market will often try to reverse the move. This happens because losing army fights hard initially and tries to reclaim territories. Failure of any such attempt will discourage losing army and results in gains for winners. Entry points, SL : Stop loss entries are safest. It’s generally safe to place and SL entry order few ticks above/below setup patterns. Once entry is done, first stop loss can be placed in the other direction of setup candle. For examples, in a bearish rejection bar, place SL sell just below the low. Rules: 1. Any time frame any currency. 2. Trading active moving markets only.

More, please...

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thank you for first reply mate. For now, my eyes are just too tired watching those charts. Too much action!! ... Appreciate first feedback. Will post more sure. my purpose here is to show everyone how we make simple things unnecessary complicated!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Congratulations for your first FF Thread As Kostas does you are saving al lot of newbies accounts like mine, perhaps you can consider changing your nick from Survivor to Savior . Happy trading

--- 帖子 #6 ---
As I am learning Choros, I would love to read more of your posts. Please do post more, as I am eager to learn more about your system as well.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I'm listening

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I feel honored to be present at the start of what will surely be a great thread for us that follow Choros and FF community as well... This is a good time to congratulate you Survivor, on achieving what we all talk about in some stage of our trading careers... "Make this or any system you trade your own"... I think you've done it here... cudos... to a great contributor in Choros and now a host at your own thread

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I'm listening too, looks like a great method, easy to understand. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Count me in Buddy! I have subscribed.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Great method IMHO, like you said we tend to complicate things unnecessarily, i like your method, simplicity, but how complex can simplicity be, so ithink you have a lot to teach buddy, i am in!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Reading candle action and price action is as necessary as learning the A to Z alphabet in order to read and write. This is what this simple trading style is all about. Please do not complicate it with indicators. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
very cool, look forward to more post

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Congrats Survivor! Always helping and sharing. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you everyone for encouragement friends. Did i explain it properly? We look for a large candle(winning army) followed by smaller candles(losing army). We enter whenever price goes one tick above or below previous candle. Its as simple as that. Konata i read your pm. The area you mark is not for beginners. initially lets concentrate on simple high probility trade. I will give tons of examples as we go ahead. that will help us all learn

--- 帖子 #16 ---
USDCHF 1H... please ask questions. Please note that it's only for learning. its not right liquid time to trade. Funny things happen in early asia. better avoided. EDIT: oops i am too sleepy. i missed that large blue bar at bottom. That shows good buying strength. let me update my chart

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Nice . And what are your recommendations to Take Profits?

Price action momentum trading

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Are this trades correct buddy?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
You are right there with me!! GU looks ok to me. EU battle is evening out it seems. Could have waited for a break lower before selling. Thats how i play it. Also note big bearish momentum earlier in chart.PAMT (Price action momentum) traders would have sold it much higher and would be having beer by now

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Warm welcome buddy. Hope you like it and it explains to you some of my trades in choros thread.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Subscribed! Thanks, thanks and thanks!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Survivor, really a good thread. I have several question : 1. the big candle is that possible have wick ? or just a body candle without wick ? 2. the big candle you advise is need to engulfed the previous candle ? so its like engulfing candlestick pattern ? 3. do you have minimum pips for big candle ? Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I like this method. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Good questions 1. Body is the actual gain made by one side against another. So thats important. Again, always remeber war analogy. Wick shows how far an army went and then retreated to settle back. I avoid siding with armies that retreats too far back. That means i dont like to take trades against large wicks. 2. yes its very much like engulfing but not in classical sense. Technically even one pip close higher is engulfing but i would prefer really large candles. 3. no minimum and maximum pips. it should just look VERY LARGE compared to previous candles. Just have a look at example chart in first post. See how large these candles look. They are just inviting you to jump.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thank you for your time. Your concept of trading looks very intresting. I will keep an eye on your thread.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Do you pay more attention to Momentum candles at key levels? i.e. Pivots, round numbers, higher TF S/R? Or do you wait until you see higher highs and higher lows for long etc? I'm just confused about exactly where you would take an entry Edit: i.e. this EU. if it breaks above the pivot, would be long?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
simple and good approach.I would love to read more of your posts. thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Nice one Survivor, this looks interesting . To get this straight, when you see a momentum bar, do you ALWAYS wait for a small losing bar and then enter one pip above ( or bellow ) the momentum bar ? Did I get this right ? What happens if you've got a winning bar after a momentum bar then ? Also in regards to TP, do you usually got for a ratio of 2 * SL ? or do you move your SL so it trails ? thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hie. I didn't participate in the trade, but I was wondering if so far whats been posted I've understood correctly. http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/20110803-bk1i-99kb.jpg Thanks

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I just made 17 pips, was it by the rules? Edit: I actually just reached my daily target (40 pips) with two more trades on GU and EU... woot

--- 帖子 #32 ---
You got it!! I was right there. But i made a killing in USD/CHF too. just have a look at 15M chart of that currency for learning. enough for today. Greed is bad. Hope others are catching things too.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
You are getting it right. Just go through entry rules and keep posting.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
So glad to read it I hope you took all 100 pips !

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi. Survivor, Could you post a chart explaining your entry for USD/CHF 15M and your killing? Btw, do you always trade on the 15M or any other time frames? Kelvin

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Interesting approach! What is your exit strategy? Thanks

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Good post! Waiting more chart explaining. Thanks

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hoping I can contribute in the future OK so no MA's, no MACD , divergence, Fibs Pivots , You use pure naked PA and you are successful (consistently) ? Any TF ? but I would presume the higher the more reliable yes Just to confirm

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hie. Was hoping that I got this right as well. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Please and thanks http://my.jetscreenshot.com/demo/201...ml8y-166kb.jpg

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Survivor It is kind of unbeliavable! I use exactlly the same strategy for my entries and along with Dance/Choros strategy I have been growing my live account like hell . I actually use this approach (mostly at lower timeframes) when I realize that I have missed the best entry point according to choros/dance. I haven't posted any of these trades to the choros thread because it would be out of topic and it would conflict unexperienced people. I repeat...this is a very accurate approach and for those who use Choros/Dance strategy, when you miss a good entry, use it to catch the train even though it is running really fast Great work survivor Regards

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You smart guy, you :nerd: I've been trying to get the grip to al this that Survivor is posting, but the pattern or something is hiding from me... I might have to read further examples, but I think it will be a great complement for Choros... and for what I've seen you do really well at Choros... I don't think Survivor would mind if you contribute with some examples too...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Good luck, I am following.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Good stuff. Subscribed. Thnx for sharing.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks for sharing you example! According my understanding of the manual, we require large bullish/ bearish “momentum” bars. So on your chart the winning is not very obvious.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Survivor, Can you please help me to understand your first post example. Please see the attached picture. Thanks

--- 帖子 #46 ---
You see failure because the blue candle did not make a lower low (did not pass the red candle's low) and you enter long there when the privious candle's (red) high has been passed. It is all about price momentum. The same with your second question. I hope this helps. I am working at the moment so excuse me for the fast answer...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I have to say you are not a Survivor. You are a Savior . I took ages looked and looked again, but as I read your charts, an "Aha moment" just appear, the world is never be the same again in one moment.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thank you Survivor. I used to use the Choros system, but never got 100% to grips with it. I recently realised that PA trading is the only safe way to trade. Your explaination and diagrams are really helping me....I am a follower :-) GG

--- 帖子 #49 ---
can u post more example of your live trading? Maybe some picture will be help

--- 帖子 #50 ---
This is what Survivor is talking about... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #51 ---
My understanding of this system! Please correct me if I am wrong. But I still donot know how to set SL and TP.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Still waiting for some information on trade management/profit taking. Other than that, great method.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I personally use MAs, Round numbers, classic S/R levels and pivot points for my exits and trade management. Hope this helps..

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Looks ridiculously simple in the most positive meaning. What I always wanted to find. I love it.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Dear Survivor My account and I would like to thank you for my first successful day trade.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I was clear in first post that this method is for any time frame. please read first post again to get your doubts cleared. No Specific exit strategy. I exit my half lot at 1*Sl so that my trade becomes free. Then i let other half run with fast trailing of tight stop. I generally let PA guide me. if i see my side winning, i stay in longer. I also take profits when i reach may daily target of 40 pips. So i exit on variety of reasons. Thanks... I Have been busy will post soon. No indicators. I used them and didnt like them. No i find more indicators less reliable. It all becomes confusing hell.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You are doing ok but i think you are overtrading. Better to look for best opportunities and not jump at everyone.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
LOL i just revealed your secret to the world Thanks for appreciation.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Thanks Thanks Thank for your reply. I didnt see it earlier and replied to the post anyway. You are very right.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Wow thank you KK! Thats a big honor for me.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I trade momentum too. Not specifically how you have described Survivor, but the idea behind it is the same. I need to start looking more at the rejection bars. For advanced users who use larger time frame to trade this, One thing that can be done is moving to the lower timeframe and placing stop-loss at the swing low for long trade and at swing high for short trades. Example, if you trade the momentum bar of 4hr tf, switch to 15min to fine tune stoploss and entry. This does NOT apply if you trade momentum bars on 15min tf. You WILL get stopped out most of the time. I love the battle ground analogy. I look at the market in the same way =)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hey Survivor, Looks like a cool system with NO INDICATORS!! which is always a bonus. Anyway, I have been scouting through my charts, looking for good previous entries and have found a lot. What I wanted to know was, do you always enter on the break of the first large momentum candle or do you wait for the next candle to push back a little and then enter on the break of that candle? I'll see if I can get some examples of trade that have failed taking the first momentum candle for entry and some taking the second (small pullback) candle for entry. Rexz

--- 帖子 #64 ---
As you can see I have two entries. One is the low of the first momentum candle which takes profit at the 1* SL. The second momentum candle however triggers a buy at the top which then reverses completely. Is this just a loss that should be accepted or have I done something wrong? Attached Image

--- 帖子 #65 ---
well done survivor. good thread. i find it hard to believe you only go for a 40 pips daily target ! some questions: if the momentum candle is way too large, do we ignore that trade. because the price movement would be so large that it may have lost steam so its best to keep out of such trades where the mpmentum candle is way too big ? what is the max number of pips we can look for in a momentum candle ? similarly what is the minimum ? in a trending market, is it best to avoid those trades that go against the trend , even if there is a momentum candle. what has been your experience on this ? how long have you been trading this, and what results have you achieved in the last few months ?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
also, how would you deal with the trades contained within the two marked red lines in the attached chart. it appears the first red bearish candle triggering a short would be a success. and the following trades after that are prone to be stopped out... if a candle is a long doji, do you still count the wick as a body ?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi rexz First of all thanks to survivor for this wonderful system.im not an active poster.ihave been trading dance for the last 2 with very good success.i have followed every post of kostas and survivor.. survivor's approach is awesome.im very fond of his contrainment entries.. im new to dance ..im no expert. IMHO.... it will be very good if we can stick to Trend of the moment.it was a downtrend so no buy there.i will test this from today...buying 2 pips above the last bar and selling 2 pips below the last bar closed.i will use TOM to filter my trades..will post the results. correct me if im wrong. thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I took this beauty today on my live account for 15 pips. took the trade on the break of the previous resistance candle.exit at the RN ... I'm filtering my trades by sticking to the TOM according to CHOROS. here the TOM was buy only..so i bought and took 15pips... bless me for more pips guys

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Just closed this one on my live account for +51 pips. Sold at the aqua line and closed position at the magenta line. Lets have more examples of successes and failures please. I'm eager to learn more about this method. GG

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Already answered. I would like to add that no matter what we do sometimes sl will be hit. I take it as part of life.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
So that was a correct trade that just didn't follow through with a win? Should we trading in the direction of the trend like what georgecv87 said?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I dont competely agree with george because sometimes momentum bars really signal trend reversal. However, i am always very careful with contra trend trades. i take counter trend trades only when i see a BIGG momentum bar. Unfortunately, i haven't detailed these things yet and your trade was good as per half cooked system that i have been able to put up. i will detail things soon with more examples.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Ok, I look forward to your future updates. Rexz

--- 帖子 #74 ---
By definition of a doji, when do you ever count a wick as a body? Suggest you go back to babypips.com and read some candle definitions

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Nice analogy on the battles - I have it similarly described by others in the industry. I am using a very similar approach on the higher timeframes - 4 hour and day and look forward to seeing this thread develop.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Survivor Thanks for sharing this wonderfully simple approach. In your first pic - featured in the manual as well - you point out a couple of momentum bars that take out previous highs or lows. You also mention reversal failures. Do you trade the reversal failures or do you just note them? If you trade them, do you stop in at that reversal highs or lows or do you wait for a new momentum bar to confirm the failure? Cheers! PS: I'm a junior member, so i don't think I can post charts to explain. I hope it's clear from my text what I'm asking.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi, Friends Provide a chart example. Unfortunately, I was not in the trade.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
sorry for abandoning thia thread after starting. I am down with flu and my internet connection is acting up. Todays chf move was easy for momentum traders. I will post charts soon. Keep asking. Keep learning. I hope to see some veterans here and learn frm them!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi All sorry, it's just not a FF trading methodology without an indicator!!!!!! LOL Here is an indicator to help show momentum bars, and if necessary alert you to them Parameters are pretty self explanatory but anyway:- xb_Alert.On - true if alerts are to be sent xi_Alert.Bar - the bar id that an alert is to be sent for, 0 is the currently open bar, which means at 0 it may send an alert which is no longer valid at bar close (good for early warning) xd_Min.Pc.Increase - the minimum percentage the bar must be over the average to be a momentum bar xd_Max.Wick.Pc - the maximum percentage the wick (in the direction of trade ie. bull High-Close, bear Close-Low) should be. NB- this doesn't affect the alerts but does affect the color scheme xi_MA.Period - the period to use to get the average candle body size xi_MA.Method - the averaging method to use When on chart it shows like this:- the aqua line is the trigger line (ie. the average candle body size + the min percentage increase) the values above 0 are the candle body sizes, the values below zero are the wick sizes for the candle direction (ie. bull candle only the upper wick, bear candle only the lower wick) - dojis will show no wick regards, John

He he he ... the EA people force their way into a PA-only thread Cool indicator. Nice work, man. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
No problem, get well soon and come start a party here!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thanks binyman,.... thanks tao. i am posting from mobile. no charts possible. but we will see. people pls posts charts and explain things to everyone.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Survivor, Below is the trades i took, I hope you can explain why the 1st is failed &amp; the 2nd is OK... Thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Ok, since Survivor asked for more participation from us I will post a recent trade that I took. I post it because there are many points I would like to make. I am not very experienced trader and I switched to intraday trading since I have read this post. This is why if I am wrong somewhere I hope someone more experienced will jump in and correct me. In the chart below GBP/USD looks like it is trending down and we were in a pullback. I entered a pending sell order below the big bearish bar. The order was 12 pips below the low price. After 2 bars the order was fulfilled and the price reached the support almost to the pip. At this point I had $30 profit. I didn't take it thinking that the downtrend is healthy so it should go lower. Well, I was wrong. The price turned around and started climbing its way up to resistance. I got tired of so many trades where price turns around, approaches my SL, I get scared and get out of there before my SL is hit just to watch it go back in the original direction and had I stayed in I would get out with at least a minimal profit. So I left this one run up to previous resistance hoping that it would not take me out. The price bounced back from the resistance and started to fall again. At the middle of the move, at the point where trouble was expected, trouble came. Well I got scared and I got out with half of the loss I would have taken if my SL was hit. If I had stayed a bit longer in the trade I would have gotten out with at least those original $30 profit. That lead to a string of revenge trades who initially showed some decent profits that I didn't take and then turned around and messed my account. The points I want to make are 1. The laws of support and resistance still apply. Following blindly a momentum bar will not do. You still need to know the basics of PA 2. If you follow the trend chances are that in the end the trade will work 3. Knowing where to get out is equally important as knowing where to get in. 4. All you need is support, resistance, momentum bars and nerves of steel. 5. Nerves of steel come with experience (= chart time)

[quote=Survivor;4831235] Price action momentum trading Thank God I found the promised land at last!!!!!!!!!!! You just revealed the whole lot to a novice like myself. We need guys like u often more than thought. Let me tell u this, your name is Redeemer and not survivor.

Hi KMidas After reading your post I felt the frustrating you must be feeling. I am not a great writer hence I hardly ever write in this Forum. Study the attached chart and go from bigger TF to lower TF. Saying it in other words If your hourly chart is down only trade the 15m on the short side. But you new that anyway. I may also suggest get rid of all your indicators you will see thing a lot clearer. Charly

--- 帖子 #87 ---
[quote=KMidas;4867543] The order was 12 pips below the low price. After 2 bars the order was fulfilled and the price reached the support almost to the pip. At this point I had $30 profit. Well I got scared and I got out with half of the loss I would have taken if my SL was hit. If I had stayed a bit longer in the trade I would have gotten out with at least those original $30 profit. Hi KMidas, I have a number of comments regarding your post which I hope you will find useful. If you are going to trade then you need a trade plan, you cannot just do random entries or exits for many reasons but one of the biggest being how will you know if your trading is successful when you make random choices? In this case your entry is related to the previous momentum bar plus a 12 pip delta, (12 pips seems quite a lot) your stoploss was set I presume above the previous momentum bar, but your exit seems to be undefined. You mentioned the support level but that can't have been your exit otherwise you would have taken it, you need to define the exit before you trade. I would suggest that it needs to be appropriate to the timeframe that you are using and expecting to follow a trend on a short timeframe is unlikely to yield success. You might want to look at a multiple of the Average True Range, or a trailing stop of the ATR value etc. or a set amount of pips, or just above the next support line, BUT you must decide before you trade and stick to it and please ensure that your stoploss bears some resemblence to the exit level ie: you don't want a 100 pip SL for a 30 pip exit plan. So most important of all you did not trust your system and allow the stoploss to work as you planned. If you don't have or follow your trade plan then you will never know if your system is successful because you will end up saying to yourself things like "well that one would of worked if I had let it run" I hope this helps you. and Survivor I like the thread and the method thanks

Hi Ozzie and MaxDoom Thank you for your comments. I don't feel frustrated about this trade because the market did what it had to do and it was almost clear in the chart what is going to do next. What annoys me is exactly that, my psychological reaction to what was happening even if I expected it. The truth is that I don't have a trading plan. So far my SL is set above/below the entry bar or over/under the swing point if the swing point is very close. My thinking is that if the price exceeds that point then there is no reason for me to stay in the trade. Unfortunately exits are still something I must master. I need to find the line between "Don't be greedy" and "Let the profits run". As for my 12 pips buffer I have observed that letting a buffer before entering the trade increases the chances that the price will run further in the desired direction. I prefer to enter my trades with pending orders and since Alpari allows pending orders 12 pips from current price I used just that. Now that you mention it maybe I will make an EA to circumvent the 12 pips restriction. How do you guys enter your orders? You just hit the buy button when you see price reaching your entry level? Also MaxDoom can you clarify this a bit more?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi KMidas Unfortunately exits are still something I must master. I need to find the line between "Don't be greedy" and "Let the profits run". Have you ever thought of letting the market decide where you entry and exits are. In my last post I send you a short graph . Everything is there,your entry's,your stops,your targets. You don't have to decide anything the market will do it for you. I prefer to enter my trades with pending orders and since Alpari allows pending orders 12 pips from current price ..... If I was you I would very strongly consider changing Broker to one with no restriction what so ever. Would you step into a Boxing Ring with one hand tied behind your back. I think not. Regards Charly

I know you are right about this. This is a demo account with the benefit that never expires so this is why I am keeping it. Right now I am in the process of searching for a broker to go live but I can't find any information about this type of restrictions

I use 15M TF, kindly advise on the level of SL and TP to set for the trade 3. Can you please through a chart reflect to me and especially other trader in the house who may be in my shoes the normal time to enter a trade (candle stick analysis) I thank you for the efforts so far.

Hi adeniyia33 You push the buy/ sell button when the market tell you to. you don't have to be convinced and you will not get a guarantee either. that where your stop loss and money management comes in. Let me explain. On the 15m EURUSD chart I have one short and one long entry . IMHO this is the only position you could have entered this trade . On the short trade the market told you go in at the Low of the Bullish Bar and your stop is the High of the entry Bar. On the Long trade the market told yo to go long at the high of bullish outsitebar and the stop is the low of the bullish outsiteBar 2. I use 15M TF, kindly advise on the level of SL and TP to set for the trade You know where your SL is placed. I never set a TP I take what the market gives me. Sometimes it gives me only 5 pips other times 1000 One example.I entered GBPCHF at 1.1824 and I have no intention of setting a TP but I will add to my position when the time comes. Regards Charly

Just came back from vacation and found your first thread! Good luck and good job. I think your approach using CHOROS in H1 has some good applications. My advice to newbies, use Survivor's method to take quick scalps (10-20p) per trade and you will have many wins. Use lower TFs to fine tune your exit. My only concern is that you don't get an early seat in the train (compared with CHOROS). But it seems to be a winning seat if you don't stay too long with it.

As a newbie ,read anything on PA (Price Action) Stay away from Indicators, you will not be successful if you use indicators Stay away from lower TF (Time Frames) Trade anything from 4H or &gt; If you Trade the 4H look at Monthly,Weekly and Daily Trent You will only need 2-3Bars on the Monthly, Weekly and Daily to see where the trend is.

i'd like to know, when is the right time to exit the trade?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
When I try to practice, the momentum bar is really subjective, it's hard to identify. I am trying to survive.

Nice thread. Great information that's very useful.

how many pips are the best timing for stop order?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hey guys, this is my 1st trade using this method and just wanted to see if I've done it right. So here is my breakdown of how I came to this trade. 1. Got my S&amp;R lines from the H1 TF. Made sure that they had at least 3 touch points to validate. 2. The red candle after the blue momentum candle showed that the Bear side didn't have enough push as it didn't have a new low. 3. I then set a Buy Stop price a few pips above the high of the Momentum candle and waited for it to activate. 4. As the candle neared the Resistance line, I held a tight SL and kept pushing it 10 pips everytime. 5. Finished the trade with 20 pips TP. Did I get this right? All feedback welcomed.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
nice point there.. but i'm always use the lock profit ea to secure my profit...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
First sorry about delay in my posts. I was down with some medical and serious personal problems. This all is subjective and not yet finalized. But here is how i am doing right now and it has been working well. Note that i trade 15M chart. If you higher time frames using this method, higher stop loss and Targets will be more suitable. I use an initial stop loss of about 10 pips. Either price runs in my direction, or i am wrong. I dont increase my SL in HOPE that price will turn. As soon as price is 15 pips in favour after the trade, i move Sl to my cost. Not losing money is my way of making money. Then, I trail my SL every 15 pips. Taking profits is pretty tricky. I generally target, previous highs, round numbers etc.However, if i see strong momentum in my direction, i hold on. If i see momentum slowing i get out. Hope this helps. Thanks for all the comments here. i will try to adress them one by one. EDIT: I forgot to mention, i always get out half my position at 20 ticks. No matter what.

Hi Survivor, Hope you are fine with your personal life. May I ask you a question? Is your chart free of moving average, S/R, TL, pivot, Rounds, etc now???? cheers, kk007

--- 帖子 #111 ---
A valid point here. Momentum bars are indeed somewhat subjective. Thats why i stress- take a trade only when its is as obvious to you as your nose. Dont try to catch every move. You will get killed if you think you can jump in after every bar and make money. Dont over trade. Let the trade come to you and slaps you in face. and tell you i am here. take me.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Price KK... i have abandoned everything. I just need price bars. You are free to use choros mas if you want.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Survivor, This is what happening right now, there was a momentum bar 3 bar ago, if I entered at the momentum bar break and set SL to -10, it is a loser, is it? cheers, kk007

--- 帖子 #115 ---
How did it go? It's all after the event analysis but still. After your momentum bar there was clear lack of momentum. I would have tightened my SL and taken a loss if necessary. I rarely keep my sl below previous bar when i am long. Break below previous bar low is negative sign for me. That means sellers a fighting back.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
You bought it right @ resistance - yesterday's high (1.4432 on my charts). Take care. Vidas --------------- "Do not sell morning weakness in the strong uptrend" - old Sumer proverb.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Ok, this strategy may reduce a bit loss, but not much less than 10 pip in this case. If a 1 pip offset is needed for bar break, the stoploss will still be 10 pip in this case. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I am not trading this one, just to discuss. There is no uses of S/R in this method. Take care.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Maybe it's just me but I couldn't make it work when these bars are later in the new trend. I found that usually what tricks me to be a breakout like that in your chart, very often is just an exhaustion. I think the best plays are if these bars are taken immediately after the opposite trend with support or resistance far away. Like a reversal bar. Look at this post to see what I mean. I don't know if I am drifting away from Survivor's logic here but I think that these bars are what in candlestick theory are called engulfing bars.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I agree with you. Idea is to jump in when tide turns. I do take trades later in move. but then i am more careful with late entries and i get out if i see any trouble. Here is an only example. i didnt trade it live. i wasnt in market. EU 15M

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Survivor, belated congrats on your first thread! I've been focusing on learning lately and missed that you started this nearly a month ago. I've read all of you previous posts when you were with Dance/Choros, and you are good at keeping everything simple, AND being successful! Thanks for sharing the fruits of your hard work! I'll be along for the ride!

--- 帖子 #124 ---

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks friend. I remeber my own struggle and hope it helps someone.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
After programming the software to analyze the excellent Dance/Choros system setups and discovering many interesting things in the process, I think that algorithmic trading is what I -personally- should focus on. And this system is something that I will be soon testing. I feel confident that I can program everything that a succesful trader can explain with words, but it has been my experience that many times this is not enough to replicate the results of successful traders. Often, successful traders have developed a "feeling" that they may not even be aware of. So they will enter trades that maybe are not exactly following their own rules, or will avoid trades that are 100% by the rules. When attempting to explain why they took or passed a specific trade they will certainly give a good explanation of their actions, eg "there was a pinbar in 1H" or "the general sentiment today was bullish". But other times they will ignore the 1H pinbars or the day's sentiment, and this may confuse those who try to follow a system by strictly adhering to the rules. This means that even if I correctly program all the rules of a system, backtesting may show results that are not better than chance, eg a winning percentage of about 50% for a Risk/Reward ratio of 1. So a succesful algorithm will have to go further than simply adhering to the rules of a system; the programmer will also have to decipher other rules that the market usually obeys and the succesful traders are applying, maybe even without consciously realizing themselves. The good news is that IT IS possible to find patterns that have promising success rates (over 70-75%) in backtesting, and once you find them you don't have to worry anymore about psychology or adhering to the rules: The software will take care of all these for you. I will soon start trading live such a pattern, while I will be looking for more. Obviously such patterns have to be at least fairly complex, because a simple pattern would be clearly visible by a lot of traders (both human and software ones) and so would soon stop working. So I have been formulating an approach for discovering price patterns: I will start with a simple idea which most probably will give no better than 50% success while at the same time monitoring other parameters of the trade. Then I will analyze the log of the taken trades, hoping that I will find a significant corelation between one or more of the parameters and the trades that have been succesful. If this happens, then a new trading algorithm will have been born. During the next days I'll be working on finding a pattern based on this system.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
This sounds really interesting, you have walked a long way since you first started with your indicator for Choros/Dance system, I'm sure you not only succeeded in the development but you also had some valuable learnings in the process. Let us know how you do with this system, I think it may show a little bit more complex as it is based almost entirely on Survivors discretion on judging a momentum bar and his knowledge and feeling of the market, it will surely be another educational journey...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Do you think you can code an indicator for me, i don't want to clogg this great thread up with talks of that, can you pm me or send me an email from my profile and I will send you the parameters, its a simple indicator I need created and is related to this trading method.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Exactly. Obviously Survivor has acquired the "feeling" for it. Some of the other parameters besides "impulsive" candles have already been described, eg rejection bars after such "impulsive" candles. But there could be more parameters that would determine the success ratio of this method: Trend of higher timeframes; Number of candles to the left of price (how congested the area is); Breaking of previous S/R; etc. Sorry, I am currently very busy with coding all the ideas I have, and this is on top of a having my own "regular" job AND doing all the programming for an online store that me and my girlfriend own. If I want to have a chance to quit everything else and trade from a park somewhere in Africa, I have to focus on finding effective forex patterns. BTW, I'm just an amateur programmer and you will never see me coding for money or selling a "killer system" for $99.99

Dear Dr. Constrainment, I placed my first constrainment trade today, albeit a failed one because I did not follow the manual, before I found this thread. I have been reading the CHOROS thread for a while, studying and learning from many of the articles written by you and other dancers. Looking forward to learning more from you. - sc

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Very Interesting Thread Survivor. The more I read, the more the fog clears. :-) I did a bit of analysis on a M1 chart from this afternoon. Please critique my understanding of your method.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Simple reason- because i had achieved my target for the day and had stopped trading. 2 looks like a good entry and my have given 1/2 lot tp and half lot at cost. 3 too is good entry. but it's late in trend. actual entry was much lower- can you see it/ anyway. that candle after entry gives fair warning to get out or at least tighten your sl.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
very nice analysis- pretty much how i see markets. forget rules. keep asking who is winning and where is right entry. soon markets will talk to you.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Here is what I think is remaining of the manual,. Setting expectation- Before we take a trade, it’s important to set correct expectation. Are we looking for a quick profit or a runaway move? I check two things to decide this. First, higher time frame- is there any momentum bar? Is there any trend? Trades against higher time frame are often good for few pips. Trades with higher time frames are often big movers. Also, if big data is expected markets will normally consolidate. Big moves will come after the data. So if NFP is expected take quick profits before data and look for a runaway move after data. Refining Entries: is it beginning of a new move? Or it has already moved a lot? Beginning of a move means either trend reversal or breakout from considerable periods of consolidation. After large moves I am careful to enter fresh trades. Logical levels: Once we have identified correct direction of entry it’s important to enter at right place. Previous candle hi/lo is one logical level. Other levels that I regard highly are – round numbers, and previous swing highs and lows. What’s the significance of this? Suppose I want to short euro and previous candle low is w.4205. Then I will rather place and sl sell order at 1.4199 instead of previous candle low. This will lose few pips but ensures that a logical support level is taken out before entry Managing: Not losing money is my first principle. I am quick to tighten my sl to cost at first opportunity. Then generally I follow with candle hi/lows. However it’s important to keep noting if momentum is still strong or momentum is slowing. It’s better to tighten sl or to get out when momentum slows down. Fakeouts: Before major market open, fakeouts are a known thing. They are better avoided though I have often lost money to them myself. Character of your currency- this is also important. some currencies are known to churn while some give good breakout moves

I used another system to catch these moves (posted in choros thread) but even this system would have given good money. Note that the sells are at lows but after considerable period of consolidation- so acceptable. Edit: i meant this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...79#post4924279

I watch 6 pairs at a time to get best trades. but i recommend you start with one pair so you get accustomed to "character" of currency. I highly recommend start with EU and dont touch GU till you are comfortable. Gu is a "churning" currency that likes to retrace deep.

As requested, following is a chart from this morning. I was trading the EURUSD London and NY sessions. During the overlap period I tend to scalp the M1 chart and enter position trades for 15-20 pips on the M5. The attached chart is a particularly busy one due to the volatility this morning. This is a snapshot, not the whole morning. I am not yet a purist, able to read the Price Action without any assistance from an indi. I do make use of a moving average cross over to assist me with entry and exit points. You will see that I get impatient waiting for the exits and get out a bit early at times. On the M5 trades, I generally set the entry, SL and TP and let it run. Today I got 78 pips.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Survivor, Congrats on your success and starting your own successful thread. I'm a long time reader from back in the day of "The Dance" with Clay, then with Kostas in the CHOROS thread (I just don't post a lot). I too have struggled with the touch trades from time to time (sometimes they are everywhere and other times I can't seem to catch one...probably normal though) and follow your posts about constrainments. I think constrainments are very powerful! I guess my question is ... I know you still look for constrainments (I was following your USDCHF one yesterday morning), are you solely focusing on Price Action Momentum Trading now or will you still try to nail constrainments? Thanks and have a good weekend!

I hope all had a good day for it was a very large range day and very unusual to see the eu move like that. I took a 120 pips out the market this morning and felt great about it! went to bed thinking that that was it for the day. But to my surprise price ended up shooting back down and I didn't get in for the ride, hope those that missed the up move caught the down move, caus eit was sweeeeeT! I am attaching a pic of my chart and where I got in this morning. Hope it helps those that are not seeing the momentum bars clearly. This has got to be the purest form of price action and its easy to see it, no complicated indicators and discretionary entries. when you see a small bar and then you see that 13 and above range candles you know either selling or buying is going to occur. Man its sweet. Thank you survivor, for you have shown me the way and I have seen the market entirely different, its clearer now. One not need to try and predict where price is heading by looking at pass movements but look at the now. Volume bars tells you pretty much whats going to happen and it works more times than not from what i see by just looking at the charts. Its amazing.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Actually these are my first two such trades. I knew Survivor advises against G/U for newbies but since I've been dancing I focused on Cable only I didn't want to confuse myself (my charts only has the G/U pair). I didn't find anything worth dancing since NY open, so I tried a couple of trades using Survivor's method: 1) First M15 candle after NY open. I got stopped out (SL is 10 pips). Hinder sight says I should look at M5 where the last one third of the M15 was in indecision. Another thing is if I had looked at M5 for entry I would've entered a little early but I would've worried about the RN (1.6000) in that case. 2) Second trade: I only looked at M5 where a large red candle failed to break the RN 1.6000 but it broke the three dance MA's (10EMA, 35SMA &amp; 50EMA). I guess this is against Survivor's rules since he doesn't look at MA's or RN's? Also it ain't a legitimate momentum candle although it's large. Pocketed 10 pips. Any comment/criticism is welcome. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
HEY THOSE 15 MINUTE CANDLE ENTRIES WERE GOOD, i TOOK THEM AS WELL AND YOU WOULD HAVE MADE MONEY. LOOK AT THE GB NOW. i ALWAYS SET 30 PIP STOPS. I made some money on those.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I lost money on them too. I dont put 30 pip sl like dappa but i should explore larger sl. Anyway, it was a rangy day. Hope things dont get worse from here.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
My first successful trade today: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've entered manually a bit late (PO works best for this method), but anyways got 18 pips. Entered also on GU, but unfortunately my SL was hit because I keep it tight.

Please do not say you are loosing interest. Your method of explaining the trades has been an eye opener. I have been watching so many trades everyday, simply based on your method of trading.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I second sashadeol. Please do not lose interest just because it has not become one of the hottest topics -- yet. Doc, you know how I found your thread? I started reading the TOC file from CHOROS thread in late August when I kept seeing the names of you and a few other active Dancers. One day I wanted to know how you guys are doing now, so I clicked your name and arrived here. Now I have your thread and the two CHOROS threads in a bookmark folder in my firefox browser and every morning I open all three threads from that folder. I also tried your method based on very shallow understanding of mine and placed six trades in the beginning of September (I believe I posted a few here). The results were mixed. Everybody has his own way of teaching, but maybe you can borrow some ideas from Clay. I've been reading his original dance thread since last weekend. He gave a lot of examples, either live or via simulator, and very detailed explanation. I'm sure if you do something similar people will get inspired and start asking a lot more questions and make this thread more active. I personally find your method very interesting but since I'm a complete newbie I don't think I understand your approach very well. I'm sure there are other people like me who need your guidance badly. So, please, more examples and more posts will be here. Best luck, scr

All thanks goes to you for creating this thread and sharing your trading method. Unfortunately I rarely post, not as often as I would like. Anyways I'm interested in this thread not less then in choros and I guess I'm not alone, because of all those posts above That's basic dance/choros: 10 EMA, 35 SMA, 50 EMA. Dotted are H1 analogues: 140 SMA, 200 EMA. But I use them only with choros, I try to trade both this methods. Choros gives early entries, Survivor's gives late entries

Currently i'm in this one: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hope I'm right, there is a probability that PPA will hold the price. Edit: worked only for 8 pips and retraced, closed at -2 pips.. Edit2: so good rejection with pin bar, I should've entered long

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Messiahua, I am not an expert on Survivor's method so I will only tell you what I see. You went short right on a support line - I added it to your pic. Price bounced right off that support TL and went up. I'm not saying I would have taken that trade long but some would. I do this kind of thing way too much so don't feel bad. While I think I'm being safe and waiting for confirmation, I'm really missing the trade. By the time I get in it's just in time to start the retrace! Hope that helps! AF

--- 帖子 #179 ---

Money management: double lots; datetime lastClose; for(int pos=0; pos &lt; OrdersHistoryTotal(); pos++) if ( OrderSelect(pos, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_HISTORY) // Only orders w/ &amp;&amp; OrderCloseTime() &gt; lastClose // not yet processed, &amp;&amp; OrderMagicNumber() == magic.number // my magic number &amp;&amp; OrderSymbol() == Symbol() // and my pair. &amp;&amp; OrderType() &lt;= OP_SELL // Avoid cr/bal forum.mql4.com/32363#325360 ){ lastClose = OrderCloseTime(); if (OrderProfit() &lt; 0) lots=0.1 else lots=1.0; } EA attached..........

thanks all followers for encouragement. i will be posting trades. lets learn and grow togather

@rozirozi: what is this EA all about? thanks in advance for a short explanation...

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Looking forward to it, share more insights.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Today pips were raining all over. Just remeber - dont buy at highs/ sell at lows. take these bars only if it says buy at low or after significant consolidation of price. Am not posting other currencies. you can check them yourself.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thanks for posting the pics, Survivor. They make the setups look obvious, which is what I need to see. I'm still having a hard time seeing them as they materialize, but the pics really help a lot.

Hi Survivor, What an outstanding thread you have started. You are one of only 5 threads on this site that has any real value to offer to the new traders that visit each day. I have been in the markets for well over twenty yrs &amp; what you are sharing should save many new traders many sleepless nights should they decide to follow along. I gave up on the tradition indicators long ago &amp; now trade in a similar manner to you. The 5M &amp; 15M tf's are what I use along with price action. My charts only contain S&amp;R levels &amp; nothing more. The low participation on your thread is simply because you are not offering the next new indicator or EA with all the bells, whistles &amp; shinny lights, but are offering clean charts depicting pure price action. My hat is off to you my friend for you are truely the one to teach the new traders trying to survive in this business. I will follow along as you go, but I may never post again as I am not very good at teaching &amp; expressing what I am trying to say unless I am face to face. I am a low tech trader &amp; posting charts is something I have never tried to master. To the new traders visting Survivors thread.......pay close attention, learn &amp; you will survive in this business. Tks Survivor &amp; may the pips rain down on you my friend. _________________

Thank you mate. i did experiment with indicators with bells and whistels. they didnt work for me. this is what is working thats why i shared it. your comments encourage me.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi Survivor Thanks so much for sharing. I trade gbp/usd and usd/chf 15min and this works quite well. Just missed a trade on usd/chf as I was writing this lol. But there's more to come

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Survivor may I ask you to comment on latest move on attached charts? It was obviously strong momentum, but I can't find any "safe", in my opinion, entries. My concern is PPA, which may stop the move at any level, thus I'm afraid to enter. Are my concerns correct and there are no good entries or am I wrong and missing anything?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Indeed this is one of the most enlightening and practical thread I read for long time. I join the people in saying thank you for sharing your knowledge.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hey S thanks for a great thread. A chart without squigglies is a beautiful thing.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
This EA is very very simple. If close is higher than open (current bar) open BUY. else SELL. Can you add my MM function to this EA? thx

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Rozi, I think you are posting in the wrong thread. FF has sections with threads for writing EAs. You would find lots of people there who will help you out. We are all just traders in this thread, not programmers.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Is this thread dead too bad i just find it.And it is very interested..it seems no one is here......MMMMMMM

--- 帖子 #196 ---
sorry mess for late reply. i do enter such trades when i see trong momentum. but i dont want to confuse any nnewcomer here so i would say pass them. wai. you will get better trades. enough for a living. Anyway, how i enter them? I find critical levels in direction of momentum. Previous highs are my fav. So i place an sl entry just at these levels and let market sweep me when they move. In fact i traded exactly the chart you show.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
i am still here. somehow people just dont find it intresting like other red green indicator threads. My life my choices mate. this is how i trade. and i will help anyone with questions, my health permitting.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
While starting out here i read somewhere how boring trading is. See this do this. See that do that. Then, i found it funny. But now i have myself reached a stage where its true.its damn boring. Please dont lose heart anyone. Keep trying. find your own way. Let no one discourage you. Amen

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Well survivor i am one who is not doing well with indicators my self.. Your method is very simple .. so you are trading from support and ressistance..

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Survivor are these correct entry..

--- 帖子 #201 ---
The origin is your post 122 Survivor, i don't want to say you how trade, you are your method and she seems to suit you. I just tell you how i see the trade. But it's just for discussion, don't see no pretentiousness. look the chart

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Yes, I've had this lightbulb moment (PA) a few months ago. We are visual creatures that crave repetition/routine and when you "get" the idea of how markets flow - it all becomes a little easier. Thanks for the thread Survivor.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
You are right about that red momentum bar. Also your way of trading is safer to be with red momentum bar till its broken. But i dont hesitate to take reversal trades. IMHO they have good rewards. Momentum changes directions and markets do reverse. with your system many entries will be missed. But of course missing entry is better than over trading.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Nearly every day I see momentum trades on nearly every pair. But it's always after I should have entered! The challenge now is to see them as they are forming.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
GU, EU momentum right now, could have taken already ~40 pips for both, but still holding. Edit: chickened out too early as usual due to small retrace, closed at +34

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Many thanks Survivor for sharing your system and help us! It seems very simple but it works very successfull especially in combination with other systems! messiahua: I think you say for this: "GU, EU momentum right now, could have taken already ~40 pips for both, but still holding." I think is "by the rules" momentum system!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
@survivor, i have always been a fan of price action, i trade by it, i draw lines and psychological levels of the market to see price action near them, i use sup/dem, i use gann analysis, and law of motion on mine, and i have similar view to you, but i think you expanded even more the meaning of candels too me. I saw your charts posted and i was amazed, looks effective in conjunction to my initial trade setups. i have traded momentum, impulse, and accumulation, rejections, fakeys, spikes, traps, etc and this caught my interest big time. Thanks survivor, good luck to your trades, inspirational, you deserve a vouch, please accept as token of thanks for sharing such information to us am reading ur pdf.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
it is easy and it works. Many thanks surviver

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I like your system, keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Nice to see another thread wit PA only. Im trading very similar system. Im waiting for candle to close higher or lower than previous, than I place waiting order. Take a look: http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1318839561 But i need to filter out some signals. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Survivor Nice thread you have. If you don't mind could you please explain the setup in bit more details? I downloaded the PDF file But no enough information. If you or anyone who is trading this method please explain it Thanks

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Traded for only 15 pips, as usual afraid to lose, but closed at reasonable level - RN and PPA the day before yesterday, also especially due to close daily target of 40 pips. Edit: bye-bye 100 pips I'm not an expert at all, but my practical example may explain a bit.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
after 2 month using this price action momentum... i keep my profits green thx dude

--- 帖子 #214 ---
good morning traders! very good example of price momentum just before (I think) I opened my pc late.....

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I have been trying to learn about trading forex for several months. The terms and concepts are available on a lot of sites, but there are so many systems that the whole thing has just seemed so confusing to me that I never thought I'd get involved. When I ran across this topic on PA, I couldn't believe it. This has simplified things so much for me. I will start trading this on a demo account and see how things go and if I get the feel for it. I do have a question, however. I see people taking pips and overall seem to be happy with trading like this. Can anyone tell me if they are earning enough money to make a living with this system currently, and what it takes to do that? For example: How many pairs: How many hours per day and which sessions: How large your account is and what you lot size is, as well as percentage of your account you actually risk: Thanks for any help you can give.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Thank you so very much for sharing your system Survivor. I was looking for something drop dead simple and I believe I have found it. I started trading this method yesterday I made 3 trades all 3 were winners. Beginners luck? I do not know only time will tell. Anyway, I plan to keep trading this for a while and see how my results go.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Survivor! Thank you for great thread! I like your analogy - war between bulls and bears very much!!!! Very simple, clear and effective way of reading the market.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thanks all mates for encouragement. I am not getting enough time to post these days. However let me assure you all that this things works for me. I have also discovered since opening this thread that i am not the inventor- there are plenty of threads talking about this very same thing in different ways. have a look here for example- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=156106 Its like once you buy a new car, you see same model everywhere. Please demo,then learn and use.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I have enjoyed reading this thread and I always value all of survivor's contributions. But I have found it difficult to implement because it's not clear to me when you should buy/sell after a momentum bar. Sometimes the trend continues and sometimes it reverses. But then I noticed something on my chart setup. Typically on the price chart I have the various Choros moving averages. In a window below I have a superimposed chart of RSI ranging from RSI(2) to RSI(16). Basically what I have observed is that when the RSI's are tightly clustered around the same value, and a momentum bar occurs, then the trend will continue (i.e., it's ok to buy or sell). However, if the RSI's are divergent and diverging, it means trouble and the trend will not continue. Two examples from M5 charts on the EU are attached. I'd welcome any comments.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I guess the main concept of this trading style is pure price action without indicators... anyways it would be more interesting to see this RSI in real-time, not after. BTW for some reason I'm also having hard time to spot entries (looking GU, EU). I even don't remember now when I last saw, took and made positive pips from this kind of trade.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Very interesting observation... Thanks!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I thinks this thread tell us pay more attention to candles language,which is much useful than any other indicators,because of indicators coming from candles and seperate our concentration. Just LOOK AT THE CHART&amp; WORK!!!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
nice observation there... what about the probability of movement when RSI cluster arround

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I have already noted in this thread that momentum bars work best in these two situations- 1. reversal after sharp moves 2. after considerable period of consolidation I think your rsi is showing this. I have nothing against indicators but i think price charts tell all there is to know. if i get time, i will post how one can spot divergence without using RSI. yes thats true. even rsi divergence is obvious in plain price chart if you pay attention. and price doesnt whipsaw and bullshit you. I will also post some advanced entries and how to detect if a formation will work or fail.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hey remeber its december and market tends to be rangy. Concentrate on reversal bars. Try to avoid continuation bar for this month. And always remeber- dont buy on high/sell at low of a trend. refer to this - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...38#post4988038 I find it surprising that you are not spotting trades. I will post some hope that will help

--- 帖子 #227 ---
In a trend always look at how far the price goes after breaking previous top. if this distance is increasing than momentum is good. if this distance is decreasing then momentum is decreasing - divergence. Problem with divergence is that sometimes it will last for hours. if you sell at every divergence you will be broke before price moves in your direction. If you watch PA you will ride the wave till very end and at the precise moment you will flip position to catch the reversal. Thats why i dont recommend using any indicator. Recent 5M EU with RSI. I went short at second top not after the rejection bar. That is art of deciding when its going to be a double top and selling at second top high while most traders wait for much lower levels to sell. Thats power of PA trading!

This is so simple and yet so amazing!! Can you elaborate more on this technique.... 1)which TF works best? 2)does it work better in ranging or volatile markets? 3)which pairs work best? btw, is there any EA that can draw this S/R lines automatically...to make it all easier? thx alot and thx to the topic opener. this is amazing topic!!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thank you Survivor for sharing your knowledge! I already blowed 2 accounts for the past several years, and I plan to start trading live again soon. Your ideas are great and I plan to put them in use after NY. Please keep sharing with us, your work is amazing! Thank you!

Is there someone that checked this simple strategy from OZZIE or have traded this way for a certain period? thanks in advance for an answer or a PM. zackery

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi S, Have been reading this thread since the start and its very similar to what im doing but on a higher time frame, i have kept quiet up until now but the way you have explained the setups and the simplicity of PA is a prime example of PA being King. Keep up the great work and hope to see more charts and explanations posted from you. I myself will also post some charts and examples as and when i get time. I wondered what the longest you have held a trade before in terms of time?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Survivor, Im new guy on the forum, but not new to PA. You war analogy is something that I always had in the back of my mind, but couldn't articuate it properly. When I read your article "price action momentum trading' it finally clicked... and you put it so well in words and I think it's important that you continue using this analogy in your trade examples once in a while...using words like attacking, taking new posts, resting, recapturing...although it is simple I think it clicks with many people.... I'd like to thank you for your continuous effort in keeping up this thread...we do realize that everything you post is backed by years of experience and although it's simple it's not easy to come up with. So far Im more of a 1hr, 4hr, daily trader..and I will try your strategy on those TF and will post my results. I do have a question regarding your very first example and here it is, it was already answered once by one of the members, but I didn't get his/her explanation so I'm permitting myself to ask again. http://clip2net.com/clip/m95923/1324...-clip-85kb.jpg thanx again, best, g

Alright I am short Market is impacting a higher time frame support point. But we have way more sellers in the market and momentum is short. Had bullish players showed me they had interest at holding support I would be long. But the short players are the once pushing so I am going with them until proven otherwise. If buyers decide to take over I will join them Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Closed it with a tiny loose ...seems like the bulls are trying to make a stand at this support. If large momentum comes in I will buy. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #247 ---
seems like strong bullish price action is coming in, if we get enough bullish price action I will be willing to invest again. For now we are sideways at a battle zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Alright the buyers at the support have confirmed me that they are the once in control...I am now a bull in this pair waiting to get triggered. Depending on how price action develops I will consider changing back to the bears or start buying . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am currently long... I will watch price action as it develops...if needed depending on the movement I will move up a time frame if we start getting choppy in the market. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Currently short in this trade ....had to move up a timeframe as the PA on the smaller timeframe was becoming a bit not trusty do to its desire to range. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Alight I have reduced my risk in the trade.... Since the sellers are not being able to really get this pair moving . Due to such movements I wont trade unless price breaks out with huge momentum out of the entire range (seems like it might not happen today) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Seems like the market is finally absorbing the buyers at support. Due to the slow market conditions and sideways movement over all. I will be taking partial profits at the next battle pressure point coming from the trend line if we can push to that point. Since all the battles between buyers and sellers have been close I will make sure that if I take another entry today that the direction I choose has alot of momentum even if it means to miss a trade. Since the market is trying soo hard to stay at a range. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Based on current price action seems like the market is starting to start taking profits to the movements of today. I will start looking to take trades in the other direction as the session continues. Though if price shows me this is just a pause in the current movement of today then I will just continue pushing. Hope I am not cluttering? if I am let me know and I will reduce my post

Alright I am liking my short position so far...this trade has no risk since I already closed halve of the position in profits. Like the fact we left some wick to the upside last hour though I would of prefer a little less of a fight from the buyers but its alright for now I will just keep on managing the trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes I agree its an attempt to reverse by buyers....but the problem is that still in an uptrend at that point....so your focus is still look for buying momentum...or just buying PA

...even a winning army is not always fighting. They consolidate, take rest and let losing army capture few posts. And then they march ahead recapturing all lost posts and some more.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Uptrend + New higher high after consolidation + failure of the losing army = winning trade ?? Sl =10 Tp :Wait and see if I have to worry about.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Was it just one of those loosing trade we have to deal with ? I was pretty confident cause the trend is up, the hammer's showing the buyers, and just after winning army and higher high. It doesn't really matter if it's a looser cause if the rules are well applied, I'll have much more winners. Just want to be sure that it's well apllied. Thanks !!

The market is failing at to sustain at the highs ...trapping long traders they are taking stops out.. Also your taking the momentum candles high in price not withing a pullback... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I dont come in at the close of the candle usually either ...you want price to break previous candles high to prove to you that the momentum that you just saw in the market are still there. If there is still bullish momentum they should be able to to continue the buying pressure by pushing pas previous candles highs. Also if I ever consider just taking the close of the candle I would need to see a stronger buying candle one with almost no wick at the top showing me that sellers came back in the market.

Damn i didn't finish my homeworks... Here's how I've read the price action. I've joined the buyers cause there was a failure of sellers (5 small candles and a large wick at the last one). So I've joined buyers one pip above the higher high, and there was no wick at this very moment.The wick appeared after the closing candle.. To be sure that I understood, your advise is to wait for the closing of the higher high candle, and for the first pull back after this candle but not to wait if the higher high candle is a large one ? So the only mistake I've done is that the first pull back was not after a previous higher high ? I got it ? Thanks again

Will be looking to unload my short position or atleast move of it at this point... We might have tons of buyers again Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
What I see in your pic is momentum...and then the market tanks ...loses all that force you initially saw. And it takes a long time for it to take it out...and those five candles retrace most of that candle. Second the market broke resistance and then failed to sustain trapping all the long traders long to take their stops

--- 帖子 #294 ---
It seems so obvious now that it is finished. Thanks for your explanations! One day, we ll be in the same direction!Well, I hope so...

Hi Survivor, Found your pdf , while searching for info on tick volume and price rate of change and its exactly the sort of analysis I was looking for. Trying to apply the strategy to current EU chart, but a bit confused by the large range period in the attached chart. If you could please clarify how to read the PA near the end of that period to avoid being stopped out by the large bullish candle '1' or the two prior bearish candles. How do we avoid getting trapped for hours and know the range has ended. Thanks, EP

Hi! if you are already in that trade I would suggest a larger SL and your box seems a little bit off to me, I would have the bottom on the wicks of the previous high, thoughts anyone? this is how I trade I think the best location for a SL is just below the previous low that would have saved you, and that means price must first go through minor support to get you, you know when the range has ended after it brakes out, after a bullish impulse move like that, price allmost allways congests going sideways, by knowing that you could just TP and wait for a brakeout to get in again. this is PA and how I trade but might not be a part of this strategy in that case I apologize.

Thanks, RT. No, was not in that trade. Lots of good tips in your reply, though. Had to read it a few times to take it all on board. I see now the importance of having the box at correct prev high/low levels. EP

You are welcome Eaglepip it's the same as when you place trendlines, allways place them at the wicks or highs and lows of the candles, horisontal resistance and support lines should be placed the same way, thats what the box are. one upper resistance line and one lower suppport line. the vertical lines in the box hardly have any importance more than indicating when a range starts and if adjusted after the brakeout when it stops.

Is anybody still using this method?

I set my daily profit in pips if I reach on that limit then stop trading, I do not stay for more profit. There are number of indicators but we can't trust on them. So, I also try to avoid indicators.

Sad to see this thread die. It's funny survivor..... I trade the "dance" as well, but have always had techniques of my own that almost mirror what you describe using here. Fantastic stuff. Lots to learn here guys. Read up!

i must say that i enjoy this thread a lot, but i have yet to fully grasp the entirety of the signals. i do use my own signals though, though they are different. although i understand much said in this thread i for one would very much like it if somebody started to post examples again.

Price action trading, enter trade when momentum is just newly built and strong, not when momentum already weaken..

--- 帖子 #313 ---
no more update from survivor???

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Is it really needed? I would say the very first post in the thread pretty much says it all. See a surge of directional movement, make sure it continues, join. And that's all there is to it.

Does Survivor finally publish a complete manual on his PA Momentum trading? I am very new in forex and after studying several strategies, I have found PA the most appealing one. I would appreciate such a manual very much.

Hi all, Really nice to see this thread still "surviving" (like me!) after i almost stopped posting. As someone pointed out, i have already said all there is too this system. No matter how hard we try it is difficult to keep things simple. That's the hard part. Why we have to start and keep tweaking everything? It starts like this- Oh this was perfect setup and yet it stopped out. Why? lets analyze. Eureka!! It was RSI! lets implement RSI into it... Then we know what happens... Here is a sincere suggestion- understand the core of the system. Then DONT over-trade. wait for the very best setups. That's the best indicator- patient to wait. With patient and experience your losing trades will be fewer and fewer. But i am digressing. Am really happy to see people benefiting from my sharing ideas. Please keep posting if possible. I will try and participate wherever possible. Thanks everyone

I know I am commenting a rather old post, but my question is quite simple (It's indeed a newbie's question): When all you guys post those graphs, how I know where were your entry and exit points?. I would expect vertical lines or arrows explicitly indicating it. Horizontal lines, labeled "sell" in your post, does not add much for knowing the exact time of entry or exit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Dear carlonees, I agree it is confusing. I general, when a horizontal line is shown, you Buy when price goes above it and sell when it goes below it. However, i would advise that you completely ignore any charts that are not clear to you. There is too much stuff in this forum to waste your valuable time on charts that are not clear to you. Cheers.

Hey Survivor ! I really like the idea of trading in this thread! It gives me a new point of view . and I can use it while I trade the dance/ choros .. You´re absolutely right to find the direction of the trend/trade in the size of the candles .. nice ..

I find this style of trading very similar to how I try to scalp some beer money from the market. Just to note, I don't use any fixed R:R ratio, and I place my SL where once price reaches, I'm dead wrong. As for TP, my thought is why take 20 when the market is offering more? I actually look for signs of slowing momentum before I exit. I also "walk" my Sl behind each "momentum" candle. Once that candle is taken out, momentum has slowed and time to get out. A before and during.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Beer money in the bag, just to find the bar now!! Its interesting to note the sudden surge of bears that stopped the trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Took a wack Friday. Entered just after lunch NY time, and unfortunately was called away to work in an emergency. In retrospect, it was a well deserved slap for going against the trading rules of trading after NY Friday lunch. Once the market re-opened, steps were taken in order to limit the loss size. Chart shows all. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, everyone System looks promising. What I want to ask, is anybody managed to program it in order to backtest on historical data?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Survivor, Great thread! I'm wondering what's your current trade management please? is it still 10 pip initial stop loss, moving the SL to BE @+15 pips and closing your first half at 20 pips?

Hi! I started to master the Momentum Trading. I collected Survivors valuable post to one document. Please enjoy the attachment. With regards, SP.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
this is exactly how i currently trade. except i start with a hard 15 point stop and i trail my stop if its a buy on the previous bars lows until its stopped out. and the previous bars highs if its a sell. dead simple anyone else playing the momentum trades? SG

If what you like is not too strong, i can help you programming an ea. Im a good programmer but i need some practice in mql4 with indicators, ... I have already made somethings. Now i like to realize some good strategies. So give me input and if possible, i give you an ea. So send me a pn Greetings Cyrus
