EDIT: Major revision to system starting at post #500 Well here we are on a brand new year. Hope all goes well with everyone in the coming trading year and beyond. I have decided to start another thread to share a strategy that I have been trying recently with some success. I've learned much here at FF, so if someone else can benefit in some small way, then that would be great. But first, the standard disclaimers: This thread is not a signal service. I am not going to be giving my entries and exits on my trades. Do not trade this on a live account. If you do you will probably lose all of your money! You have been warned. So now...on with As Easy as "PI" PI is a simple trend following system using moving averages It is not complicated, it is not a radical new idea. Just my slant on some old standbys. I trade PI on the daily charts only. I know many will ask if it will work on other time frames, so let me preempt that question. The answer is I don't know. I haven't really tried it. I'm sticking with the daily because that's where I think you get the long term trends that are profitable with this system. It also fits in nicely with my trading schedule. The history: As I'm sure is the case with many of you, I have tried many systems and indicators to try and catch good entries and exits on major trends. That's where I think the money is, or at least a good share of it. I messed around with a lot of indicators that seemed to do a better or worse job of showing up the trends. Finally I've ended up with a simple MACD crossover using the values in "PI", thus the name. As you may know, PI is expressed fractionally as 22/7. So.....I am using the MACD with 22 as the slow MA and 7 as the fast. (I'll let you more esoteric types ponder the cosmic significance of that ) I enter when the MACD crosses the zero line and close/reverse when it crosses the other way. Take a look at the daily EurAud chart below for the last couple of years. Some pretty great trends can be captured this way. So the purpose of this thread is to discuss the strategy. I'll try to answer any questions. I'm not looking for wholesale changes to be implemented, certainly not adding multiple indicators to filter trades. For every bad trade you filter out, you'll probably filter out a good one. That being said, there are always improvements that can be implemented and you all may have some valuable insights. More on trade setups, stacking of trades and money management to come.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
As with any system, money management and trade size are important. Here's how I currently am applying these to this strategy. Initial entry: As mentioned I enter a new trade when the MACD crosses the zero line. I am currently trading this on a small live account so I'm using a higher trade size then I might with a larger account. I am entering my initial trade based on 3% of my account equity based on a 100 pip stoploss. 100 pips is usually enough space so that I will get an exit signal from the MACD before the stop is actually hit. While I use 100 pips for the trade size I am actually placing my stop at 300 pips. It's more of an emergency stop as I exit my trades manually. But it's there in case we have a market collapse or something. Addon entries: I like adding on positions in trend trading systems. 1,000 pip moves are great and all, but I'd just as soon have many positions I'm taking on the journey. So I am adding a position at the break of each pullback, basically a 1,2,3 reentry. I typically define a pullback as a daily bar of opposite color to the direction of the trade. So for example: I have a long trade going on EurJpy. It goes to 108.50 then pulls back to say 107.85 with a down daily bar. I place a pending buy stop just above 108.50 so that if the trend resumes, I have an addon position. Below you can see an example of this on a EurJpy I have going right now. The market has moved about 1,070 pips since my initial entry on 11/16/12, but I have a running profit of 2,300 pips due to 5 total positions.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Selected pairs: It's important to realize that I do not trade this system on a purely mechanical or technical basis. I don't take every cross or trade every pair. Some pairs and market conditions just aren't conducive to a trend play position. Check out the NzdUsd chart. Lots of crosses and a couple of trends, but extremely choppy. I'd just as soon stay out of these types of pairs until they look a little more trendy.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Here are my indicators and template file. Again, MACD is the only one I'm using for trades. The rest are trade information indi's etc. and a MA crossover alert if you want notifications.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
It should be noted, and as you can see from the trade explorer attached, that it takes awhile for trend trading systems to get traction. I've been trading this live since Nov. 16, 2012, so about 1 &amp; 1/2 months. So I have some great floating profit, but have actual losses to date. Again that's typical for long term trend systems. You have several short term and smaller losses trying to establish positions that don't work out. Meanwhile your successful trades haven't 'banked' yet as your riding what is hopefully a multi-month trend. We'll see how that plays out.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks a lot for sharing ! I will try it on Demo Account.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Spyderman, great looking explorer, very well done. Hope you can enjoy some long term success with this system. scfx

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks alot for sharing...will check it out and report back soon. Edit:- what's the closing criteria? is it the appearance of opposite signal on macd? on second look just got my reply by re-reading the first post

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Great results so far, i hope it keeps going for you. jt

--- 帖子 #10 ---
An other way to re-enter is when a candle close above MA7 for Long and below MA7 for Short.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
The problem here would be that, in my mind, closing above the MA7 would not necessarily indicate a continuation in the trend. Your going to get more entries, but, when the trend finally does change and you get an exit signal, you may well have many positions underwater. Remember using the cross as an exit, you are almost guaranteed that your most recent entries are in the red. Don't want too many of those.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I forgot to mention. On my addons, I'm using a 1% risk rather than a 3%.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi, Spyderman, congratulations! While looking at your Trade Analyzer in more detail, I noticed that there are quite a few losses when trades were mostly opened and closed the same day. I am not to criticize, just to pass an idea - there is a thread opened by BlueMental "BMI-MACD Magic Monster", where he gives a pretty good analysis in regards to MACD indicator's zero line. Might be helpful to avoid some losses. Otherwise, very impressive. I subscribed, want to check how this will progress... Good trading in 2013! Lietuve

--- 帖子 #14 ---
good mornnning spyderman....downloaded your indis,tpl etc..???s regardless of the chart I attach the tpl to I have pos size, risk$, acct eqty, risk, USD/JPY ask etc..how do I get rid of it, or is it a necessity, or does the pair change???

--- 帖子 #15 ---
+++++++++++++++++ My guess is you are missing a component. Until SMan clues you in, you can open 'Objects' on your chart, locate the specific entries, then delete. "Today, I would like to become the man my dog thinks I am"! ~ Jack Thomson

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Try going into the options and resetting. When you copy the indi over from one chart to the other it keeps the original settings which obviously don't make much sense on the new chart. Once you do that it should change (for example the "UsdJpy") to the current chart.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hmmm...not sure which you are referring to. I went back and looked at all the trades and there were only a couple that had small losses early on in the system evolution. When I first started I was still tweeking the MM so that may have accounted for closing some trades the same day. I also had tried a few addons on the H4 time frame and that didn't work as well. As it sits now, I only look at the trades once a day, so unless I place a trade on a cross and then the bottom/top falls out, then there wouldn't be an open/close on the same day.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yeah, as he mentions the zero line is just another ema. In this case it's the 22 ema. When the MACD line (7 ema) crosses the zero line its the same as the 7 ema crossing the 22 ema in the chart above. It's just a more graphically easy way of seeing it and the histogram adds to that.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
It seems GBPNZD would be a good pair for this on 4H or higher TF...do you agree, mr spiderman?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Lot of chop on the 4H. The Daily would have been great early this year but it's been a mess since August. It looks like it may be widening a bit so perhaps better days are ahead.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
That is where you would just park a couple limit orders..... one on each side of the price range and wait for the breakout.....

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Might still be a lot of chop coming out of that range like there was going in. But with the recent bullish news on the Kiwi, it may well be setting up to break south.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Just take the highest high and lowest low + a little ... if it gets hit mind your money management and it would be worth taking the shot. Just a thought. as to you trend following.... I like it... looks close to what I do, I just don't do MACD.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Guys I put the indies in the indi file and opened but my account balance is showing wrong and so is the entry price am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Check your settings. Do you have "equity" or "balance" checked.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Sorry to be a pain but where do I check for that

--- 帖子 #27 ---
nice thread! you got 1200 % profit/// why you not taking it and run?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
can you unlook the "stop (gap)" on your statment?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I was thinking the same thing. Of course if that doubles again in a few days or week, we would both look the fool..

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Well, if you trade a system, you trade it. If I take profit and run...then what. According to my signals, I should still be in the trade. Should I wait for another signal to enter. Why enter on that new signal if I ignored the fact that I should have stayed in originally. Once a trend reverses, there will be drawdown before the exit. That's not fun, but inevitable with a trend system. But I am using discretioin with my entries and exits as mentioned before.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Sure, but not much to see. As I mentioned my stops are 300 pips. They should never get hit though.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I assume you know how to use indicators. Right-click your chart, select 'indicator list', double-click 'positions calculator'. That opens up your settings screen. Make your adjustments.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Check out all those JPY crosses retracing. Yen is still weak, so might be a good opportunity to add on. I'll be looking to go long if the trends resume and break those previous highs. If not, then we may be looking at a trend change, but nothing in the news would indicate that yet.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello Mr. Spyderman Is it possible that you did not include the position size calculator in your zip file ? That particular indicator is rather difficult to code and I was wondering if you may have purchased a version which is not accessible otherwise. At any rate, I could find nothing in your zip file which suggests a PSC Please advise Cheers

--- 帖子 #35 ---
You are right Buffett. Sorry about that guys. I missed grabbing that indicator. Here it is.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thank you. Happy trading in the new year.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks Spyderman and slim buffett that got the osition size account size eyc working but it is not showing correct price or stoploss /entry in fact it is not even changing the pair when you change price????

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Try this one. It may work better for you. One is figured on account equity and the other on account balance. You can set it to figure off of number of pips stoploss or a particular price level.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for being so patient I have it all worked out now and I am looking forward to just pipin!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Good deal.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hey spyderman - this is a truly fascinating strategy and one that will fit in well with my time schedule. If you get a chance, could you talk more about which pairs you trade and when? How do you identify a pair that is about to trend? Thanks! Pete

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Well, as you can imagine, I can't identify pairs that are about to trend. Trend following in general is just that, following a trend once it begins. MA's, or any other indicator that I know of, are lagging. They tell you what the market has done to that point. Now that may well give an indication of what could happen in the future, but you never know for sure. Otherwise we'd all be rich. Now in addition to looking at pairs that have been trending well recently, I also look at the news and global sentiment. I've been studying about order flow recently and I believe it can help any system to be traded better. For example, I'm in several excellent positions on the JPY pairs. You can look at the chart history of the pairs and see they're not bad as far as trending goes. But if you couple that with the information coming out of Japan on their stance on weakening the Yen, then the global sentiment is to short the Yen for the foreseeable future. That validates the trend and then you can just look to add. With the USD you have a partial "fiscal cliff" resolution now and with the FOMC making statements about ceasing QE over the next year, what seems to be a stengthening dollar. That should favor going long USD through 2013 (not that there aren't other factors like incresed risk appetite). I think you could do a fair job with this system (time will tell) trading it straight technical. But if you factor in some descretionary order flow principles, then I think it will excel.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Excellent, thank you. May I ask where you get your news and global sentiment? IFR Markets?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Spyderman, Using this strategy on EURUSD, can a short trade be entered today as there is a MACD cross identified? Winf

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yeah, IFR and Bloomberg.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Well as mentioned in post #1 I don't give trade signals But, when I do enter a trade on a cross I typically wait for the close of the daily candle and make sure the MACD has crossed down/up. That hasn't happened on the EurUsd on my platform yet. That being said, the dollar is performing well of late and the Euro's been falling off. It definitely has my interest piqued.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks Spyderman Sorry but i was just trying to confirm my analysis matches with the rules. Yesterday the cross was completed and today i should have entered as per the rules. Right? Winf

--- 帖子 #48 ---
My EurUsd does not show that it has crossed yet. It definitely looks like its headed that way. You can get slightly different readings with different brokers because there daily bars end at different times.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Spidey, Can it really be true? A system from a respected OP that is both easy to trade and highly profitable at the same time? Impressive! Thanks for sharing. Best regards, BC2

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks Bobcat. It's early yet, but I hope it works out. We'll see how it evolves.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Spidey, How did you determine the PI settings (7, 22)?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I had been working with several indicators, trying to find one that could get me in and out of longer term trends at the best points. I had found one called the "fisher" that worked very well. But I wanted to convert it to standard MA's so that I could implement alerts and the like. I tweeked the MA's and MACD until I came up with settings that were closest to the fisher indi. That brought me to 7, 21. Then I just changed it to 22/7 (PI) with no change in the outcome.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Congratulation

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Spyderman, the fact is, if you trade a cross of an macd 0 line with 2 ma crossover system you will sooner or later blow your account

--- 帖子 #55 ---
And exactly why is that?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The oracle has spoken..........

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Spyderman i think what driven18 is trying to say is that a simple macd crossover strategy will fail in the long run as any back test will demonstrate , right now you are having some great success because the JPY pairs are so weak so giving you a great result. Basically what we are saying is a macd zero cross is just a MA crossover strategy and unfortunately as such will run into trouble in the long run. Right now this is working well due to jpy weakness across the board. However wish you well with your thread just a friendly word of warning. All the best.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You are looking at wrong backtests then.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Here are a couple of MA cross systems you might want to think about befor you say MA cross systems are doomed to failure, these systems are still being traded, there have been losing months during the year but have yet to suffer a losing year. EUR/USD Only Do I really want to start this journal 2012 ended the year with 1552 pips and 2013 is at 149.2 pips so far....... Also you might consider some of the bigger fish in the trend following world who use similar long term methods.....

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Well first off, there's a big difference between "running into trouble" and "blowing your account". Secondly, there's only one thing that moves the market and it ain't MA crossovers. It's not stochastics, or rsi, or trendlines or fibonacci's...it's order flow. People placing buy orders and people placing sell orders. If my trades are on the same side of the market as the big players that are moving the market (hedge funds, central banks, etc.) then I will profit. One of the main factors determining where and in what direction the 'smart money' places their trade, at least over the long term, is global sentiment. Now I certainly acknowledge that an MA crossover does not guarantee which direction the market is heading. But it does give a graphical representation of which direction the global market sentiment has been moving to this point and for how long. As I've already stated, I feel that discretion based on an understanding of market sentiment and order flow, is necessary to maximize this, or any other trading strategy. Most people, especially newer traders, are not inclined to look heavily into market sentiment. So, in lieu of that, I think there are far worse indicators to 'indicate' the market sentiment than MA's and MACD's

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Spydy.... You are far more patient than I in responding to post like that... I am getting old and cranky when it comes to idiocy.....lol Regarding the use of MAs or MACD these are great trend following tools, they are not predictive they are representative of what the market is doing and price momentum..... with that said what we do is FOLLOW price momentum with HIGH PROBABILITY trades using good risk management... Hope this helps clear things up a bit for the cheechakos....... Keep up the good work spydy.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Spyderman Thank you for your strategy. Could you please explain how you would deal with the entries, stop losses, and addons in months like March, April and June 2012 as is shown below for the daily EURUSD. Thank you. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Example of the trade on Eur/Usd ! Good trades !

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Another Example on AUD/JPY !

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Pretty obvious those would have been losing months on that pair. My sorrow would have been somewhat ameliorated by the nice run I'd of had during Nov. 11 thru Feb. 12, again in May and July. Or for that matter the two nice runs in the Eur/Aud while the Eur/Usd was struggling. Hard to look back at exactly what I would have done as I don't know what was in the news at those points.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Gotta love those yen crosses. If they do nothing else, they trend. Just gotta keep an ear on the BOJ. Shirakawa seems intent on weakening the Yen, at least for now. When the stop...guess what that means.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Possibility of re-enter now !

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Yes, I had a addon on Friday. I have 3 positions on NzdJpy

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Spidey, Regarding add-on trades, do you simply place a limit order above the previous candle high (long trade), or do you wait for the daily candle to close before making a market order? Thanks, BC2

--- 帖子 #72 ---
If I have a high that retraces enough to make a down bar (red) day, then I place a buy stop above that swing high. So every new position would have at lease one down day between them. Here's an example on Gbp/Jpy

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Alternate 2-8 Just playing around, haven't tested but it's "visually appealing". Notice in the nice uptrend the stochastic stays above the 65 level, etc., etc. Don't have time/desire to post all the MA's but they are non-lag, 8, 34, 200 When the "chop" gets going one might want to refer to the 1H chart as is (partially) evidenced between 1.32 and 1.33 all the best

--- 帖子 #74 ---
With the greatest respect to your position in the forum I don't believe you have explored all the facts. The previous posters are correct in asserting that the 0 line cross of an macd is simply the crossing of two ema's. In this case it is the crossing of a 7 ema of a 22 ema. This is a subject area which I have back tested thoroughly over the course of several years and I can promise you that the system as it is will not be profitable in the long term. The entry and exit criteria as explained by the OP are a simple ema crossover system and in 23 years of backtesting with reputable data they do not show a profit long term. I felt compelled to register in order to post on this subject because it seems that many people are happy to trade systems that have not properly been back tested and this system is such a case in point. It strikes me as odd also that the posters that are stating their views similar to mine are being ridiculed or accused of being "cheechakos" whatever that may mean? I only wish that the facts as they stand are known.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thank you for your insights but while I don't trade with the MACD I do trade an MA system that has been very good to me. no losing year yet, some skinny years but no losers. We all need to find what works for us ... It is very difficult to trade someone else's method due to the trust factor...... We each need to grow and develop a method we can trust and execute without fail even through the periods of inevitable drawdown. As to cheechackos pronounced "chee-cha-ko" that is a name we called green horns in Alaska....

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Dodgy, Firstly, welcome to the forum. As reqards the system, no one is arguing whether or not this is a 'simple' MA crossover strategy. I think I made that clear from the first post on. And yes, we are aware that the zero line cross is the same as the cross of the ema's. I also mentioned that when talking about the reason for the MA's on the chart was for alerts, etc. Obviously when the MACD crosses zero the MA's are also crossing. I think what become irritating is when posters come on any thread and simply through out a "this will never work" and then leave. You feel compelled to register to make a statement that "The entry and exit criteria as explained by the OP are a simple ema crossover system and in 23 years of backtesting with reputable data they do not show a profit long term." That's it? That's all you have to offer. Are you saying you have backtested this system with these crossovers with 23 years of data. Or are you talking about all ma crossovers. Have you backtested them on all pairs, in all market conditions. That's not much for 'facts as they are known' I've been at FF for many years and seen many strategies. Some make more sense to me than others. I've even seen some that are down right laughable. But that doesn't mean I have to go on someone's thread that takes the time to share something they've discovered with others...free of charge...and throw out a "this will not work". I just don't get that. Oh well, off my soapbox for now.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
True dat.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hello again Tradestar1, I do have to say that your signature had me in stitches for a little while :-) I have never heard the cheechako thing before but not being from Alaska... you know. I simply wanted to point out that I have many, many years of experience in this business and that what I am seeing here is a simple 2 ma crossover system which will NOT work out long term. You can try and help people and I realise that negative thoughts are not always what people want to hear. I have nothing against ma cross systems as such, it's just that a 2 ema cross system such as this (albeit hidden behind the MACD thing) is just not profitable in the long run so if you have this knowledge why not try to pass it on to the younger traders? It still worries me slightly that anyone would try and use an MACD 0 line cross and NOT KNOW that it is the same as a 2 ema cross system. This is symptomatic of bad research of an indicator. Again, just trying to help people out. I wish everyone the best of luck with their trading.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I just read this after I placed my previous reply. I'm sorry you feel offended about my input into your thread. I will no longer reply to your thread. I wish you the best of luck. I was only trying to give you the benefit of my experience but I realise that the haste of youth will often overlook the caution of old age.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I think you need to re-read the thread. Especially these parts in post #1 "So now...on with As Easy as "PI" PI is a simple trend following system using moving averages" "I am using the MACD with 22 as the slow MA and 7 as the fast." Not quite sure how you got from there to being worried that I didn't know the MACD zero line cross was a 2ema cross. If this is any indication of the diligence of any backtesting you've done well then... (sorry, couldn't resist)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Glad you enjoyed my signature I have a somewhat warped sense of humor. Also I lived in AK for about 11 years..... liked it a lot .. We encourage you to open a thread to share some of your knowledge, as to my sharing my method .... I have, and as stated before about how it is difficult it is for someone to trade somebody else's methods so I pretty much don't go there anymore. anyway lets not hijack spydy's thread and open one up for these discussions.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Well I would do but considering the reaction I got from just stating that a 2 ema crossover system doesn't have too much of a lifespan I may not bother. I think you are right about the trust thing, no one will take it from me that the OP's system as is will not work because I only just started posting here so suddenly that invalidates my 40 years experience of investing in one market or another. With the passing of time you lose interest in trying to convince people of things. If these greenhorns have got their mind set on something then let them carry on. It's no sweat off my brow and it's not my money.

The "haste of youth" has yielded the likes of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerburg, and so forth, untold fortunes. Living in the past is not very useful and each must find their own way ?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
This is actually quite nice, I haven't yet read the whole thread but I am making good profits with this (demo). I am using it on 5m and 15m charts and making good gains like 10-20 pips. Thanks for this post.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
40 yrs of experience and yet you failed to realize the obvious.He is a position trader adding to position once the trend takes off.There are numerous ways to find the trend (method is irrelevant of finding it)and frankly not hard.Hard part is adding to a position and holding on to it for maximum profit. Sounds familiar? Donchian did it which was copied by Turtles although Donchian had different concepts to enter a trade like 4week rule nevertheless he was looking for strong trend to pile on profits. To someone making over 2000% in less then a year is staggering. My total utmost respects for Spyderman I have been a silent lurker supporter.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Spidey, What do you think of NOT immediately taking the 7/22 cross? Instead, wait until the 1st pullback and subsequent pullbacks, and ONLY enter the add-on trades . Why do this? From casual observation, I believe it would limit false reversals, due to ranging market conditions and make the "new" trend prove itself before we commit our capital. If the add-on trades are where the lion's share of the profits are, it would seem a prudent method. Personally. I would prefer a higher strike rate and lower net pips production in order to achieve this goal. I would maintain all of your other rules and setup. I will be testing this with my live account, and report back if anyone is interested.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Yeah, that might help with some of the chop. Just picked a Yen cross below. Doing as you suggest would have cost us a couple of hundred pips getting into this last trend late, but it sure would have helped avoid all that carnage in the preceding months. I wonder about lot sizing. I've been 1x on addons and 3x on the initial. Main reason for the smaller addons is I figured your going to get some drawdown at the end of the trend before you exit. But maybe they should be consistent across the trade. Definitely keep us posted and I'll look at that as well. Thanks for the input Bobcat.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Thanks for the kind words Davit, Hope to see you around more often.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Enjoy your thread v. much as I also use similar indy. Not often to find traders using MACD (same go to BB). Love the way you stacking trades (excellent). A lot to exchange views with you, spyderman. Pls. keep posting.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
hi all...can anyone explain the indicator--pipsometer_5_?????also all the other data that is posted on the right of my charts==risk, risk money,account equity etc, it's the same info regardless which chart pair is being shown???

--- 帖子 #91 ---
sfg, The pipsometer is an indi that tells you how much in profit your positions are for that pair. It's in pips. It aggregates the readings for all positions on that pair. So if you have 5 different entries at different levels you might have entries sitting at +150, +75, +60, +25, -30. The pipsometer would then read +280 pips. It doesn't take into account any difference in the lot sizes for each position. The risk,etc. readings are for the "position calculator" It was inadvertently left out of the first indi zip file, but I uploaded it later. Some are having trouble with getting it to work so I also uploaded two other lot size calculators. Just look in the paperclip at the top of the thread for all the downloads.

It'll be interesting to see how this translates to lower time frames. Obviously global market sentiment won't come into play much. You'll really have to watch out for the news releases though. On the daily, you can ride those out, but lower time frames would really skew your results. You have a nice spread there on the E/U so you might do some nice scalping. Keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Just had a thought as I was looking at FXThug's chart. What if we were to use the 22ma as an early exit signal. Rather then waiting for the MACD/MA cross you could exit if price closes on the wrong side of the 22. Now in the case of FX's chart that would have taken a trader out early on that last recent down move. But doing a quick look at my charts on the dailies, it looks like it would have closed the trades 2 or 3 days earlier then the cross, sometimes saving hundreds of pips. You multiply that by the number of positions and you have a significant difference. Then it makes me wonder if the cross is necessary at all. Just trade on the right side of the 22 ma. Need to check further to see how often you get a close on the wrong side of the 22 that does not continue on and give a cross. As you all are looking at your charts, keep this in mind.

Thanks Spydy, that clears it up, I downloaded the other files KEEP-UP the good work for us wannab's

Spidey, Kathy Lien has what she calls the MOMO Trade. She uses price crossing over an EMA20 with standard MACD crossing @ 0 level for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Not sure who Kathy Lien is. Must be some kind of genius... Of course moving average strategies will never work.

Here are a couple links to an MA method where there is NO money management in place, in other words you are always in the market .... You may have to sign up to be able to get to the page but it is free and is also a pretty good site ........ The methods use an SMA vs Price.... when price closes across the MA you enter that direction..... you stay in untill price closes back across the MA at which time you close and reverse position. Sounds simple enough..... Remember these results have absolutely NO money management ...................... 20 PERIOD SMA vs PRICE Over the 5 years of trades YTD is 2767.1pips gained. This one is using a 50 period SMA....... same rules as above..... 50 PERIOD SMA vs PRICE Over the 5 years of trades this one YTD is 5700.4 pips gained. Now with no money management it would take some big brass balls to trade it because there are considerable periods of losing trades. But with good risk management and a little fine tuning you have the beginnings of a profitable tradable system......... Here is the LINK for several more methods. Including a couple MACD ........

Hi Spyderman, I got to know you from Chubbybgood's 3% risk give you bliss system thread where you volunteer to write EA and all the help you have given to the readers following the thread. I know from there you are a nice chap. Glad to learn that you have started your own thread. I have a question regarding choppy market. Normally, we only know that the market is choppy after the fact. Each day when you are scanning the market, at that point in time, you may not be aware that this currency pairs is in a sideway. By the time you know it, you have already incur some losses. One method is to use the higher high higher low/lower high lower low as criteria. There are currency pairs which exhibit increasing wider range during consolidation period: higher high lower low (a few pips higher than the previous high and a few pips lower for lower low) before it continues its previous trend direction. If you wait for the PA to settle down before entering the market, you may find that you have given a large portion of the profit to the market because it may not be obvious for you to determine when it start to continue the trend. I am wondering does it make any sense to follow all the arrow signals irrespective of whether it is choppy market (especially at its infancy where it is not so obvious to detect it) or not. The trick is to use more currency pairs to offset the minor losses associated with the false signals from the sideway trend. Increasing the sampling size may magnified the profits and helps to minimize the losses caused by the false signals. If this works, what sample size is consider a reasonable one? Any other better idea to screen out the sideway currency pairs? I hope you understand where I am coming from.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Patguay, Welcome to the thread. It comes down to the old saw...the more bad pips you filter out, the more good pips you fail to get. I really don't know the best way. It's something each trader will have to work out in keeping with their own trading style. Bobcat mentioned earlier not taking the first cross and waiting for an "addon" signal. That may help in many cases. However there are always those trades that make a cross and then head parabolically upward or downward. Your going to miss those kinds of moves. So far I'm content with the way this is working for me. The proof will be when some of these currently strong trends come to an end and close out. How much of this floating profit can be booked?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi I put the screen my scalp trade, close minute ago add ichimoku with my settings that I like trade was late couse I was eaten

--- 帖子 #102 ---
So in reality, it is hard to screen out those currency pairs which is undergoing sideway trends. Anyway, I have entered 7 positions with different currency pairs, 5 are non JPY cross. It is remarkable to note that within 10 hrs, my position has appreciated 6% of my capital. I guess by increasing the sample size, it will help to offset the losses and reduce the significance contributed by individual "side way" currency pairs. I will add more to it when any currency pair fulfil your stated criteria.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Well the trades have pretty much all turned for the good again. With the weakening Yen and the strength of the Aud &amp; Nzd there are a lot of strong trends going. As positions get piled on it just makes things grown exponentially. Tough not to take profit, but then what. I remember a quote earlier in the thread in response to taking profit and running: So I'll stick to the course. Time may tell that it would be wise to trail the stops on all trades, at least to a couple of hundred pips. But there have already been a couple times (like on UsdJpy) where we had a significant retrace (162 pips) and then the trend resume. I'll have to think about that one.

This looks like a great system Spyde, it seems like it's really difficult to figure out when a market is consolidated or ranging, but it sure pays off when it's trending. Even when it is consolidating, we have a set stop loss, while when it is trending profits can go through the roof like in the CADJPY pair. I will be following this system and also trying to demo trade as well on the Daily Charts. I really like the idea of adding trades on when the trend is continuing. Are all those trades that are in the open trades section, not counted in your All time return of 10,678 pips? So technically you would have 17353+10678 pips = 28031 Pips? I was just curious. Good luck with everything Spidey. Your system looks phenomenal! And also, I guess the EURCHF pair is an obvious no trade pair, because of the price floor by the ECB. So fundamentals do come into play!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
how this trade ding so far??

You are confusing me with With This GUY

Which trade are you referring to brokerr

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I haven't added up all the lost pips, but currently I have 18,000 pips of floating profit. As long as the Swiss Franc stays pegged to the Euro I won't trade the Chf pairs. Theirs no point, they mirror their Eur counterparts. The only exception is that I trade the NzdChf rather than the EurNzd because I get a better spread on my broker.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Oops...just went up another 1000 pips in the last 15 minutes.

Thanks the weakness of JPY ! I have doubled my account with JPY this week How do you trade the pair EUR/USD for the last days Spyderman ? Thanks a lot, Green pips to all !

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Not very well... I'll be closing a -200 pip trade at the end of the day. The Euro news today killed those short positions.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes me too when I saw there was a lot of serious news on EUR I exited my short and stand to see how price will go.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Yeah according to the news they're projecting the Yen to go to 90 vs. the dollar. That would be another 1350 pips on that pair. I have 9 positions currently. If it goes to 90 against a weak dollar it should move very well vs. the Commodity countries I just keep waiting for the bottom to fall out.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Yes it could have a lot of movements again so trade safe and take profit on several trades before seeing a reversal

--- 帖子 #119 ---
has this thread got anything to do with the movie ''life of PI'' by any chance ?

well i made 80 pips on eu only, and 30 on gu. but not using this system though. anyone who didnt make pips on these, .........should be pulling thier hair out !

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Spidey, Unbelievable! Your account is up 60% in just the past two weeks...you are currently running +23,000 pips in profit...and there are only 3 people viewing this thread? My gosh! What does it take to get traders involved? Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Yeah, things are moving along well for now. Not much for people to look at I guess. Being a long term trend strategy, there's not a lot of bells and whistles to keep peoples attention. That's okay though. Less typing for me.

I know you've used to play around with the TDI. How come you dont use it anymore?

Well we had some contrary news coming out of Japan last night. Yen Rallies as Japan Official Amari Comments on Currency I'd love to bail on the Yen pairs, but I want to see how the system exit si gnal comes thro ugh. We'll see if it stabilize s today.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
if you close all your active trades how much profit do you have in percentege (%)? *i dont mined the cash value :-)

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Looks like about 330% since 11/19/12 if you factor in all the losses to date.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
The particular strategies I used the TDI on just didn't seem to perform for me. Looking back at the PI pairs, I don't think it would have performed as well as the MACD I'm using.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
i am here at forex factory for years, and i think you are one of the best manual trader i ever seeing so far. your trading way on the daily chart,by far more reasoneble than trading the 5 m or 1 m charts.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well thank-you for the nice words. Time will tell yet whether this strategy plays well in the long term. As some have already noted, I've benefited from quite a run on the JPY pairs. And yet, that's the point of a trend following system. There are going to be trends, you just have to be patient enough to be there when they happen.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Spidey, I have been following the thread for a few weeks and have been testing out with very small lots. Looks great! But I just wanted to point out an observation. It looks like the JPY crosses seem to work out the best if I look back in time. They seem to trend very well. I haven't crunched any numbers, but obviously you have seen what they have done in the last month or two! Keep up the good work. I will post more as I start to trade more. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Spyderman I have been following this thread and it looks really good so far. Maybe I am mistaken but it seems recently you have closed some trades but the MACD hasn't crossed over yet. e.g. you closed a EURJPY trade but the MACD is still very much above 0. Can you explain why please?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Ed, Thanks for following. I'm not sure what you're referring to, but no, I haven't closed any of the JPY trades yet. I checked my platform this morning and none have hit, or are close to hitting, s/l's either. I can't tell from my vantage point exactly what you guys see on the trade explorer, so not sure what may have made you see that.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Subscribed! In your opinion, how different 7/22 against the standard setting 8/26?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Obviously not much as can be seen below. 7/22 is Red and Light Blue, 8/26 is Orange and Dark Blue. But if you switch to 8/26, then you wouldn't have "PI" The key, for me, really isn't in the exact cross, it's just establishing that I'm in a trend and then stacking positions in line with the market's sentiment.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Do you find the PI system work well in H4 or H1? Reason asked is Daily is seem long waiting for some like me . How H4 or H1 offers one a small loss in every trade taken, just my opinion About stacking, how soon you to stack (make a new trade)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #143 ---
No, I don't trade the lower time frames with this. I want to get into long term trends in line with Global sentiment. That takes a while to happen, get moving, and then to turn around. The lower the time frame the more 'market noise' you're going to get. Many news releases that have a shorter term effect are going to skew your results. For the news releases that have a longer term effect (market shift) you can incorporate into the long term trend.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
As far as stacking goes, as mentioned earlier, I stack a position after I get a daily reversal candle. I then place my buy/sell stop above/below the recent high

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Spyderman, May I know how to interpret this P/L statement? Today, there is a return of 17%. Does that mean that you have closed a trade that earn you 17%? If so, the exit is 0 whereas the entry is 1. If 1815 pips is equivalent to 17%, I wonder how does -1.0% associated with -2,670 pips as shown in the weekly performance. There are 4 entry and 2 exit for the week. Does the exit refers to closing of the trade and entry mean opening new positions? This is quite confusing.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
To be honest, I don't know how FF's trade explorer works for sure. At least not as far as how it figures entries and exits. You'll see on my tote that I use that the numbers are different, at least for this week. My chart only records actual closed trades as losses and then the floating profit/loss in the current section. I did have 1 entry today that hit a pending sell stop (GbpAud). I'm sure the 17% profit is just the increase in floating profit for today. The weekly is confusing on the FF explorer. The number of entries/exits is correct, but as you can see on my tote the 2 exits were for a -410 pips total. I'm guessing the FF explorer takes the negative pips from the closed trades and adds to it the number of negative pips of floating profit for the week. So the weeks total negative profit (floating and booked) is -2,670. Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
It is quite difficult for anyone to comprehend having a closed trade of negative profit to add on to its floating profit. Since this is a closed position, any profits or losses should not be added to the floating profit. Because this is a done deal trade, it is not "floating" anymore. How to tell whether the floating profit is increasing over the weeks? Is there a figure where it indicates the net profit/loss if you decide to close all your positions? Or the floating profits can be interpreted as the net profit after you close all the positions?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
The floating profit is what would be booked if you closed all entries. Then that would be added/subtracted from the account balance.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Generally most traders would have closed their profit trades, for the intention not to further lo$$ing. You are good indeed. Cheers

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Agree. I prefer higher time frames and this is also the way I love trading. New traders tend to get excited when they trade intraday charts (less than H1) because of quick pips but over the run they would lose more than they can win. There are too many false reversal signals down the smaller time frames and chances are we could always go wrong because we are trading against the trend from the upper time frames.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
So we're seeing some nice resurgence in the Yen pairs today. I have several buy stops that may be triggered today. Also had triggers in the other euro crosses. Analysts are predicted a rise in the U/J to 90 over the next months then as the Japan reduces their stimulus we may see it fall back to the 80 range. Who knows if they know, but it would be interesting to see that nice downtrend in the Jpy crosses this summer. Just need to be patient.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Pardon me for a brief indicator change request but, would some kind person consider updating the MA Cross indicator shared on post 4 to fix the alerting to only once per cross instead of every bar? I don't know MQL good enough to do it myself. Thanks Spyderman for sharing your system!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Good trades! Don't mind if you can post often with charts so that we can understand your entries and how you stack trades? Thanks

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Here's a couple of examples of recent entries and a pending I have on Gbp/Aud. All others should feel free to post any charts or trade setups they may feel are valid.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Not being a smart azz here, but really, spyderman is not here to spoon feed you. Go back and study Posts 1 , 2 and 46 Here is a link http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...39#post6339639 And if you click on any of the trades in the Explorer, you will get the chart you so desire, see below. The trade entries are ALL shown; have you drawn a line at those levels and had a look at where that entry might be on your own charts? No, didn't think so. He trades the DAILY charts, that should be a great starting point. There, I feel better now...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Spyderman, I have a question. Do you ever open trades on Sunday? If you got a signal from Friday, would you open a trade when the markets open back up on Sunday?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I think you can see the charts are not the original charts showing the entries and stacking. So I am not blind (unless you are??) but courtesy to request Spyderman for his kindness to post the charts to share. New traders will be benefited from his efforts (I am one for sure). I am a fair follower here - if he finds no need then it is ok. I do not need you to lecture me he is not here to "spoon feed" me.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks for the post, Spyderman. Don't mind to share your thought on G/A. Even thou there is a Pin Bar Jan 10 at a level - showing a potential long trade, you would still go for short at the PB's low, based on Daily? Why? Thanks for your time.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
First of all, I refer you to this quote: As for the Explorer chart not showing every entry, that is why I suggested plotting the entry lines on your own chart, take the information from the Explorer. All I'm saying is, you need to do so work, some study, good luck Hope I don't get banned by spyderman as I have just open a new demo to test this going forward, I can suggest a new broker with all 28 pairs, ECN spreads , if I am still around

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Erebus Perhaps stop and waste no more time. Your points serve no educational. p.s. Sorry all if I bore you.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Because that's what this strategy is centered on. It's not about candlesitck formation. As a side note but parrallel note, here's why I don't like candlestick trading. At least not on the daily. Brokers have different open/close times on their daily candles. So while I might have a pin bar or engulfing pattern on my chart for a given day, you may not. Your not going to see that difference in the MA's as they're just that...averages. So, back to the strat, sure enough the pinbar on G/A didn't turn out to be anything in terms of a trend change. You may have picked up a few pips, but that's for another trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
"No Bannings Today!, tis a Friday. Let there be peace in the Kingdom" Erebus and I have crossed keyboards before...hopefully in good fun. He has a very direct way of speaking, but in the end he's often correct. (Unless he disagrees with me of course. )

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thanks for that, all comes back to me now! If I could sling you a vouch I would, maybe one day. Congratulations on a fine thread, I will be following along and posting charts from time to time. Forgot to mention, that broker is GLOBAL PRIME , supposed to be Non expiring account too, so that will help with my demo. Here is the GBP-AUD in question, as you say, candle pattern be buggered, price looks to ready to break new lows soon. Do you ever flick to the Weekly to see what is happening there? I think it helps to screen potential trades if there has been ranging price action on the daily. And this GBP-AUD might be interesting in the weeks ahead Have a good week end all

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Perhaps this can help a bit for those who are unfamiliar with trade explorer. How to see trades and trade history Have a good weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I must say I don't typically. I do keep up with the daily news on Bloomberg so price usually reflects that. However it might certainly be beneficial to see the price patterns on the weekly.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes, stick to the trading rules OK, now I see the c. f. is not a key decision in your daily trading method Your comments indeed are value. Thank you for your time. Keep posting charts if ok for you - I think some ppl learn faster with pictorial than wording (English is not my main lang) Have a nice weekend.

Hi every one, I have a simple question for you Spiderman, Do you take into account the Swap in your strategy ? Thanks for you time. Toinou

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Anyone that has been on FFF for any length of time has probably had a look at the Building an equity millipede and probably moved on as it all seems a bit daunting. But now that you are here reading the As Easy As "PI" thread, another long term trend following method, I suggest having a look at these 2 posts, # 3482 and # 3483 Post # 3482 He describes the method used to entry a position(s) using daily charts, and holding them for some time, target 1,000 pips actually. Need something to do while daily charts are forming anyway. I think it is relevant to this thread; wonder if spyderman got any inspiration over there?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
No doubt. I read the whole millipede thread (daunting is an accurate word) and it definitely changed the way I looked at position trading. You can see from some of my other threads that I tried different ways to capture the spirit of Graeme's ideas. One thing I'm not trying to follow here is his exit strategy. I think many struggled with interpreting his "diversification" method. Perhaps, looking back now, he was just referring to market sentiment, which I've come to appreciate more since then. Anyways, I definitely think Graeme's thread is an excellent read for anyone serious in long term and successful trading. I would just read from the start up through the point where Graeme discontinued posting.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Nothing specifically wrong with IBFX. Forexbroker Inc. sent me a solicitation email offering a trading bonus which I took advantage of. Good spreads , micro lots. Twas a good fit. We'll see how it goes when and if I withdraw...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Simple answer...no. Longer answer...I view the swap as another cost of trading, just like the spread or commissions. After all, it's interest. In my view, if you're paying a significant amount in swap then you must have some nice positions open that have been there for some time. With this strategy, that would only be the case if you were in a long term trend. So your profits would far outweigh any swap costs.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Someone asked in PM about the short entries on G/U. Can't attach chart in PM so here's the answer: Here ya go. You can see the cross down on the 8th, and the addon trade on the 16th. Again, your broker may have different daily candles but it should still be showing short.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hello, the choise of this system remembers me to the Sidus v3 Indicator. With this you have an alert on crosses the EA and an Filter with RSI. Settings whatever you like. I trade this indicator in M30 timeframe. Matching with the MACD Hist it seems a great setup.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
That is one reason for some who prefer charts to understand the entries (I am one). For your both shorts, you set stop loss 300 pips each? When will your BE a trade?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Perhaps you'd do better by not concentrating on the Trade Explorer. Open some charts with the indicators in place on the daily and find the entries. Once you find a nice trend in place, then look for the addons.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
You're concentrating on the s/l too much. The s/l is there for emergency only. You will tyically get an exit signal long before s/l. I will probably start trailing my stops at 300 pips, just in case we get another Japan earthquake event or something like that.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
As mentioned early in the thread I had been basing my initial entry lot sizing based on a 3% risk and my addon trades at 1%. Moving forward I believe I will adjust this so that all orders go in at 2%. As account size increases (hopefully) I will adjust the lot size percentage.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Yeap... it was very volatile an hour ago on Yen!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
The BOJ's announcement on easing wasn't quite as bold as many had hoped. So that spurred a selloff. We may get a consolidation here while the market sorts out its thoughts. Definitely worth keeping an eye on it.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hi Spyderman, Nice thread, I've been following with interest for a while. I have a question regarding your stops. Where did you come up with a 300 pip stop? I've been experimenting with a similar strategy using a 100 pip stop but getting stopped out too often. Thinking of increasing to 250 but wondered if u had done any research to come up with 300. I'm wondering if it may be sensible to look at ATR for each pair I trade and have a different stop loss amount for each pair which moves with current volatility? Any thoughts? Keep up the good work. Suntan

--- 帖子 #185 ---
As I've mentioned my stop loss is for emergency only. I don't want it to ever have to trigger. You should get an exit signal from the MA's/MACD before it hitting. It's just there for emergencies. 300 seems to be far enough so that retracements don't take them out. There's always exceptions. Last night the GbpJpy dipped down and took out the stop on my most recent position by 2 pips. Now it seems to be turning back around. such is trading.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi Spyderman, I was checking your trade history, and i was wondering why you didn t add a trade on EUR/GBP on 17 january ( check the attachement) ? best Toinou

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I did, at .83301. It's up there.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Well, this move back on the Yen pairs took out my stops on the Eur and Gbp crosses. Time will tell if that was a blessing or a curse. Up until yesterday I didn't have those stops pulled up to within 300 pips. If it turns out to be a mistake I may have to not trail stops and just move to BE after a big trend establishes itself. Hard to know. Anyways, it banked about 5800 pips.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
hi spyderman, after i view your trade report, i found out that almost all of the winning trades is with the yen, may i know is this system work best with the yen? it seems doesnt works so good with other currency, may i know is this true?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
oh Sorry i didn't see it. I'm not used to Forex factory trade list. Anyway I will follow carefully this thread it s really interesting. Toinou

--- 帖子 #191 ---
No, not necessarily. This is a long term trend system. Different pairs trend at different times. Right now the Yen pairs are in a big trend. I also have several solid positions in some Gbp and Nzd crosses. If you look back over the last couple of years you should be able to see a variety of pairs that would have done well, which may indicate they could in the future.

Hi, I just came across your wonderful and so simple but powerful thread yesterday. And I saw a few replies regarding how many pips the stop loss should be away. Further to that I did bit of analysis on daily change (in pips) on audcad and audchf. I did this to find out how much has the market moved if we take extreme cases to set our stop loss, especially on daily basis only. For audcad, the max it moved down was 148 pips, while max it moved up was 143. For audchf, the max it moved down was 444 and max it moved up was 805. I may be wrong, but if not, hope this helps to understand extreme moves in last 2 years or so. Let me know if you guys want the spreadsheet. It would be worth to know what pairs follow good trend, but agan this can been easily seen on a chart... so I didn't work hard on excel for this All the best, I am keen to get grips with this strategy...

Thank you, it s much easier now

Sometimes I think it would be better to have a target for each add on trade, say ADR or 2 x ADR or something, depends on strength of each trend I suppose - that way, if the trend continues, pips are banked and there are even more add on trades; when the reversal finally comes, exposure will be less, hopefully already covered by profit up to that point. This is the fallacy that I see in back testing, sure a method may be proven to work, but nobody knows the future, and trends will not be the same, not the same pairs, not at the same time. This can be proven in stock market, where you begin your portfolio in the cycle can make a huge difference. Have a good day, E.

Great trading Spyderman! Keep up the excellent work! Here is a little addition to your already proven powerful concept. Here I took the liberty to add a 128 period EMA (dark blue) for a typical cycle baseline, then added the two Heiken Ashi Smoothed candles, first the 7,22 cross and then the 7,128 cross. It just cleans up the perspective of price during those times of consolidation and helps aid in seeing those turning points a little easier for me. Otherwise, Thanks for your posts!!! Thanks, sjc

Hi Coondawg I think you should open up a new thread to share your trading philosophic? Very nice HA Smoothed displayed. Indeed a trend indicator. Care to share the HA Smoothed indicator? Cheers

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Could you share with us your spreadsheet please ?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hi, I've attached the example sheet, which has data for one pair. have a look at it and let me know if you don't understand it. I've done it with very basic understanding.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thank you, looks interesting, which indicator did you use to get this data ?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Data comes from bloomberg. It is just raw data, using bloomberg template. No indicator used, here.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
got it. thank you. I have another question Spyderman, (sorry for bothering you ha ) on your trade list you have been trading many pairs, so somehow do you try to diversify the risk ?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Wow, 15 min to USA open, been traveling by plane all day, finally sitting in hotel room, first chance to check charts - I can see that it must be a great day for "PI" - hope you got some good add on trades spyderman I definitely have to set up a VPS so I can get this running &amp; testing properly

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yeah, things are moving nicely right now. Had about 5 addons yesterday and another this morning. I'm back in teh Eur/Jpy, so seems like that stop out earlier was indeed premature. That will end up costing me in the long run. Oh, well. I'm think about an alternative to the x pips of s/l. I have a trailing ea that will trail behind a MA. Seems like it might be the thing to just trail 10 pips behind the close of the 22 MA. Set an initial s/l of course and then maybe move to BE after a strong move, but then switch to trailing. That way that retracement this week wouldn't have taken out the E/J. Maybe the G/J would have been hit...the pound was pretty week at the beginning of the week.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Not sure exactly what the question is. By trading many pairs, I am diversifying the risk. If you mean many pairs with the same cross, i.e. JPY, then I don't worry to much about the correlation. Different crosses will act slightly differently, have orders triggered different days etc. This week I had both long EurAud and short Gbp/Aud in good profit (until the Aussie weakened), even though Eur and Gbp often act similar. I've never been a big fan of avoiding pair correlation as a rule. I think you just have to look at the situation in light of the global sentiment. I mean you can get yourself into analysis paralysis if you start questioning every correlation...Can't trade Eur and Gbp together...can't take Usd and Jpy trades together because they're both safe haven currencies...can't trade the commodity currencies together, Aud-Cad-Nzd...can't trade Cad along side Usd...etc. etc.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thank you, it was the answer i was looking for, especially about trading many pairs with the same cross.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Since we have a gap during the weekend, do you set up any trade just before the market close on Friday ?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I don't treat Weekend much different. My daily bar closes 5:00 pm EST so that works well for weekend close. At the beginning of the new day, in this case Sunday, I place all my trades at that time.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
hello, This is USDCHF using daily timeframe. Do you have any pending order on this pair ? and if yes how do you deal with it ? do you keep the 2 pending orders , or the last set up who shows up cancel the previous ?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
To answer the first part of your question, no, no pending orders. I am not trading the Chf crosses as the Swiss Franc is so closely pegged to the Euro. So if you trade UsdChf, you are basically trading EurUsd. Not the charts below, basically mirror images. To answer the second part on the setup in general, remember we're looking for a pull back and then a break of the recent high to signify a resumption of the trend. On this pair the first reversal bar is still valid so I would place a pending above that recent high. It would actually go above the wick two candles to the left of your first arrow.

Hi Just finished reading the thread and I am subscribing. Regards John from Durban

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Welcome John. There's not much to say on the way. Pretty basic and yet slow moving at the same time. Not as sexy as scalping, but hey, what ya going to do. Feel free to ask any quesitons.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thank you and the sexy scalping from my side is out of the door - patience will count from now on. John

--- 帖子 #217 ---
We have a possible set up on AUDUSD, when do you think it's the best time to enter ? I'm guessing we have 3 possibilities before us. 1/ we could enter at the opening of the next candle (the MACD shows us sell signal) 2/ we could wait for the next pull back and enter when the trend resume 3/ we enter at the break of the purple line. thanks for your time. Toinou

--- 帖子 #218 ---
AudUsd has been pretty choppy. Aussie's been all over the place with the China economic situation. I'd opt for waiting for a pullback and reaffirmation before entering.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
spyderman, if you did not try to filter the signals on the weekly chart ?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Not sure what your question is here?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I think he meant that we have to compare the weekly trend and wait for a set up on the daily. for example trend is up on the weekly, we should trade only long on daily. but... well i'm not sure about the question either.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi Spederman Where are the short entries when NY closed for G/A and G/C based on your trading? Thanks, Cheers

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Here's my trades on G/A. I wasn't currently trading G/C, not sure why. Maybe it was being too choppy in Decemeber, but it looks pretty close to G/A.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
based on your chart i think spiderman strategy should look like that. correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
oups, your answer was faster than mine.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Sorry for the translation.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Well, in any case, I don't use the weekly for confirmation. Next, we'd have to go to the monthly. You can only stack filters on so long until you don't get any trades. Maybe that's the way to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Sorry my English. Actually I wanted to ask when is the next short entry, if the trend continues down. Well your picture shows it Thanks.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi Spyderman You don't trade the metal? For Silver, there is not short entry yet, until may till the next close - tomorrow? Just like Silver, for Gold, the short entry could be made on yesterday. 2 days ago couldn't due histogram yet to cross below 0? Hope I am correct with the above. Cheers

--- 帖子 #230 ---
If you may, Spyderman, a PB is seen upon NY closed, would you take a short trade like this even thou the histogram is not &lt; 0. Thanks

--- 帖子 #231 ---
No, not just a pinbar by itself. There have been times when I've jumped the gun on the zero cross. Usually if price has been moving that way a couple of days or I hear some news that makes me think the market is heading that way. You can find pinbars all over the place, and they vary from platform to platform.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Sorry - I missed the chart. In fact I referred to U/C where a PB is shown upon NY closing. So what you advice is still based on the histogram crossing 0 to take an entry, right? Any comment on post 229? Cheers

--- 帖子 #233 ---
No, I'm not taking that pinbar over the movement of the trend in general. Could that be a trend change point? Sure, but it could also be nothing but a blip on the way up. Just to repeat...I don't take candlestick formations into account with this strategy. I'm trying to look at longer term market movement. On post 229. No, I don't trade the metals, at least not with this strategy. But if you did then you could make an argument to jump in on gold a little early due to the downward movement. A little the same with silver.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks for your time. It just happened the charts are meant for metals. Say for non-metal pairs, would you take an entry based on the given charts shown.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
If you may, Spyderman, when you make a new entry or add-on, pls. post the charts. I want to learn your trading philology. Hope it is ok for you. Thanks and Cheers

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Actually I don't want this thread to be a trading journal or a signal service as mentioned earlier. I think the general concept is pretty straight forward. I certainly don't mind discussing entries in general, but would like to see you all post where you think they should be. That's how you really learn a system. As I add features or tweek parameters I'll share those with everyone. For example, I've committed to using the 22 EMA (actually 15 pips behind) as an exit rather then waiting for an opposite cross. Then if we get the opposite cross we can start looking for entries the opposite way.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
1/ The short entry should have triggered yesterday on G/N, correct? And the SL is high of 22/1? 2/ For N/U, is the next long entry shown correct? 2/ How soon to BE a trade? Thank you for your time, Spyderman.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
HI SPYDERMAN thank you for good system.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I always give a few pips above/below the swing high/low. On G/N my entry is just below that 5th candle to the left. Didn't quite trigger. N/U looks about right. Maybe just a couple pips higher. I don't move to BE. I set initial emergency stop at 300 pips and then trail order 15 pips behind the 22 MA

--- 帖子 #240 ---
great performance i wonder how many pips you pi hahahah

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Spyderman Again it is en entry issue (case study). As no sign of histogram &gt; 0 was seen when candle "1?" closed, but when the candle closed "2?" the histogram is seen crossed &lt; 0, should one take the short right away even thou the candle is at the confluence area, or wait for pull back? Thanks for your time. Happy Trading.

For a young doctor that is not very wise words - how do you help your people, laughing at them or helping them John from Durban

thank you for your input you are right i have carried away a lot i apologize to all my best wishes

--- 帖子 #244 ---
These are the situations where you a a trader will need to mold the system to your style. Either may be fine, however you may also see that downward movement several bars earlier and decide to jump in early. I've done that before. Or you may pull back and see that A/F is in a trading range and has tested this low twice recently. Now I don't believe price will turn around just because it hits a certain point on the chart, but that area of support may well indicate where the market feels it should not go any lower. What's happening in AUS and with the Franc right now. What would the market sentiment have you believe. These are questions you need to ask and answer, especially when you have a pair that's ranging. Just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi Spyderman It is 04:00 here in South Africa. I must change my trading schedule to accommodate the daily time. The re-entering, say in an uptrend, must the pullback candle retrace below the 7 ema line, in other words, cut the line ? This matter is still grey for me. Have a nice day John from Durban

--- 帖子 #246 ---
No, it just has to be an opposite candle. In an uptrend, once you get a red candle, then your set for another entry.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thank you John

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Spyderman Thank you for your system. I really don't understand how this thread is so quiet, when we have IMHO the best system I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). Maybe people need a shorter TF in order to have quick gains (and quick losses)........ . Anyway better like this, less to read everyday. I'm waiting for funds to arrive to Dukascopy and next week I will start this gift. Thanks again. Cheers

Thank you for your generosity. I would also like to ask , do you open or trade on fridays or Do you take profit and wait till monday for new entries. Thanks

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks Caillou, Yeah this is not as exciting as some strategies with a lot of 'in the market - out of the market', and lot's of bells and whistles. So there's probably not much to talk about unless someone has a question. Boring strategy...just makes pips. Hope it works for you.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Great results Bee, sounds like a good way to test it out.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
No take profit, just close above/below trailing MA. On long term trending strategy, I don't care what day of the week it is. That's the nice thing about the long term, it negates much of that type of market noise.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi all. Spidy..when you initiate a trade do you set SL&amp;TP points at that time or do you just let them run..as it seems on your explorer listing at beginning of thread??

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Spidy..ignore my last post, I went back to post 1 and re-read the entry/exit criteria...Thanks for a great method, I'm finally seeming to get profitable..

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Again...no T/P. Initial 300 pip s/l for emergencies. Trail s/l at 15 pips or so behind the 22MA.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Don't mind if ask. How would one know a long term trade is to begin? Is it when the histogram crossing 0? ### I noticed many your thread followers asked your exit rule. May be if you may post some charts to illustrate the exit rule?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Markets going crazy today...in a good way. Account's up 36% just today. Hope this keeps up.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Noone can predict what the markets will do. All you can do is look and see what has happened in the past, compare that to what you know about the market's current sentiment, and extrapolate on what direction things may go in the future. Go back and reread the first couple of pages. Look at the examples on the pairs that show good trending action. When I entered these JPY crosses, I certainly had no idea how far or fast they would trend. You never do. The thing that makes this strategy work (at lease so far) isn't the entry signal, it's just participating in the trend and stacking positions. Are you going to lose on some trades...you bet. I'm in the hole thus far if you just count closed trades, because the losers close quickly. But you're trying to catch these long term trends that more then compensate for the losers. I still have many positions open that I took in Novemeber, some over 1200 pips now. That makes up for a lot of small losers. As far as the close...you can see in the attached chart, I use an ea that trails my stop in relation to the 22 MA. Here on Eur/Gbp I have it set to trail the MA by 15 pips. The 22 MA right now is at .8411. The trailing stop is at .8396. As price moves up the stop will too. If price moves against me then it will close the trades.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
This long TF method is starting to grow on me, thanks for sharing Spyderman! I've had a rocky experience trading 5M (see my thread in the rookie section: One hit wonder or am I on to something? ). I'm actually quite comfortable entering trades on D1 your way, since the stops are large enough to withstand considerable drawdowns. Now I'm less nervous at work, since I don't have to monitor my jumpy 5M trades all the time. I can actually get some work done Currently 4 trades are in the green for me. I'm well aware they could all turn around taking out my 150pip stops, but I stand to lose 5% of my balance. Hopefully they'll continue heading my way, getting me much more than 5%!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Glad to hear you're having success Matthew

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Something else you might remember Matthew. The current trend is fairly mature which is not to say that it's done, just be aware of it. So if it starts to falter don't get discouraged. Take the next signal and control your risk, more trends will come and all will work out fine. On a side note........ It is extremely common to take some losses when you begin a new system, you have to hang in there, take the signals and the profits will take care of themselves. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks for the encouragement Tradestar1 This system enables you to create your own equity millipede, just like Spyderman is currently doing since November. Who knows where the current trends will end. Maybe next Monday or a couple of months and 1000 pips later Riding that MACD wave..

You might also find this helpful....... How to Start a New Trading System

--- 帖子 #265 ---
An interesting read. When to get into a trend: only at the start or jump in along the way with lower stakes? I've been applying the latter. Spyderman mentioned taking addon trades, which I've more or less put to practice (live).

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Kind of funny how this has ended up building a form of millipede. I hadn't really intended it that way when I started even though I've tried several other ways to implement Graeme's thoughts. He did always say you have to find your own way of entering. Of course there's a lot of differences. I don't plan on holding for an undetermined time, nor closing 'nearer' term entries while keeping the old. Also, I have no provision for having older long positions in play while then starting short positions. Another aspect of Graeme's method was moving everything to BE...not trailing. Makes me think... I wonder if I could layer in some more "Graeme-esk" type entries into PI. Move them to BE more rapidly and then just ignore them. They could even be much smaller lot sizes compared to the other positions. Hmmmm. Might be interesting.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I know somebody, who made a living from this strategy. I still hesitate to give it a try. for your closed positions: All Time-33.8% For opened: leverage 41:1 return 2,037.8% That is very nice number, unfortunately this system you will get out when is already to late. Maybe you will have some loosing pips and your exit signal it will be when is "only" +300% I must admit is nearly impossible to get out at the max/min point always. So very probably it will be to soon or to late the exit. My problem is I am exiting to early(scalping in trend direction or counter trend). Not catching all movement, because has no steam and so on, an I wand to protect my green pips. In your strategy: you take small and accept some looses (with SL or exit signal) and finally will close a trade to cover your loses and have money for next losers until build up another successfully trade. For sure this isn't working in ranging market, just in trending. Why is this better way to build up to 41:1 leverage in 2.5 month, than take a trade with 41:1 and scale out/ close if you are wrong, if not, than "let the profit run"?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Any long term trading strategy will have an initial balance drawdown. Has to happen. You're closing losing positions but not closing the winners as it's not time yet. The true test can only be after a few rounds of the successful cycles have finished, then you will see a truer representation of the system in the balance column. Well if every trade I have open reversed right now and hit the trailing stops, it wouldn't fall that far, so that's a moot point at this juncture. You're right, it is impossible to consistently get out at the top/bottom. As I've said several times already in the thread (have you read it?) I will get drawdown off those equity highs as different pairs close out. They won't all close at once, but it will happen. So how's that working for you? Most assuredly...again as has been posted many times. The good news is: "Markets Trend" Open some daily, weekly, monthly charts and zoom out as far as you can... I'm not willing to 'gamble' that kind of leverage on being 'right' one time. With 100 positions, if you're system has a positive expectancy, you have a much better chance to come out on the plus side in the long haul. If you flip a coin your odds are of course 50/50 going in. If you only flip it once, and you're betting the farm. You better hope you get the right side of that 50. If you flip a coin 100 times, you're odds are still 50/50. Each time you flip it, and more importantly 50/50 as a trading set. I might lose the first 10 flips, but I know that statistically, the block of trades will come out 50/50 and I have time to "catch up". Now if you're trading system has more like a 65/35 win rate, I'm still not willing to risk the farm on one trade for fear of hitting that 35. Now I would be willing to risk 1/100th of the farm 100 times, have a measure of confidence that the trading set will hit the 65/35 mark. Now I have 1 1/3 farms.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Well, honestly bad. Bad isn't because the system, but because of the boredom, leak of action and adrenaline take a look here and discipline... When I am staying with "my trade" styles, using "normal" leverage, those few days are super ok, but are super boring. Monthly+20+50% usually, not really in negative, but happens, it depend how many time I need to break out my rules. For that reason I wanted to have "something else" something new, interesting. Also I know the forex can't be interesting and profitable too: or boring and profitable or interesting My friend with this system had yearly +40+80% how much do you expect from it? I think if I would have responsibility for a huge amount of money I wouldn't search adrenaline here, but elsewhere, and I would be even more profitable. Unfortunately banks doesn't like either for loan.

Well if you're looking for excitement, then a long term strategy probably isn't going to fit the bill. That's one reason we have a slow thread...not much happens hour to hour, or day to day for that matter. I'm trading binaries and spreads for more of an intraday 'fix' if you will. I like PI cuz I can sit down at the end of the trading day and make all my adjustments, set my pendings, etc. No babysitting. Couldn't really say what I expect on an annual return. I expect more than 40-80% but that may be "PI-in-the-sky" ( ) thinking based on being up 700% in equity since November. Ask me this November and I'll tell you.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks, I have changed to EMA. If this is good, I will re-read again your setups. The day candles can be different from your because my broker use GMT zone and maybe your others. What I like in this method it is "no babysitting" you can be in excursion, sick or everything: once / day 15-30 min and is done the daily job. I like that hourly rate =)) If this is about 2x cross MA: I have tested between first systems a few years ago, and I have failed. Mostly because I wanted to trade Eur/USD and this pair is trading with bounce. Hard to follow Gatornila, but with a lot of time you can describe it, 4h chart is for scalping, is for daily work and I don't want to work anymore so much. Like now the price is above the 2x ma, this system should say a strong buy, but at this pair if is combing in normal way than should be a pull back, if falling not so often and is falling a lot faster. Let me see if I did correctly the homework: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here is they key: why can't be programmed with an EA. Or maybe it could be if that entry is confirmed by the weekly chart? it is 7 day lagging

The other fact what I can't understand is the multiple currency and they correlations. What the reason to take the both majors and they crosses too, beside of higher spread at crosses? AUD/USD Sell 1.0380 AUD/NZD Sell 1.2420 NZD/USD Buy 0.8462 AUD&lt;-&gt;NZD&lt;-&gt;USD EUR/GBP Buy 0.8330 EUR/USD Buy 1.3483 EUR/JPY Buy 123.00 GBP/USD Sell 1.6004 GBP/JPY Buy 144.87 EUR, GPB, USD, JPY And I see more JPY pairs Why isn't better to take one more trade side at the major instead of the cross? 67 open positions... point 7

--- 帖子 #278 ---
22 vs 7. At the daily chart the 22 MA is the monthly one, because in one month there are 22 working days, usually. Why the 7 and why not 5? - weekly

For me it was more helpfully than the 12 year in the school I knew, but never saw the definitions as : Closed equity, Total Equity, None-Risk equity, even if I have used it. In many web pages I have seen move the SL to BE, which can be a slower account killer than the to short SL. Stopped out at BE 10 times, and once won 5 pip, that is still -5 pip if the spread it is just 1 pip, but from BE it is a free lottery ticket. If I trade safe only 1% risk and daily max 1 trades very probably I will not make enough money ever to become rich. Many bibliography what I have read, it had once a bigger trade (with all his money in) or an unclosed trade and came back several weeks/months from Holliday and there it was the fortune. I know it is a kind of gambling and can make very sad the 6th consecutive loss with a high leverage: build up the account from 11.76% of initial capital...in case of 30% risk x 6 consecutive loss. In case of coin toss systems: set a TP and a SL and forget it. There it comes the importance of none risk equity! Trend Following is a strategy prone to drawdowns Not sure which system will meet my trade style and in which can I believe. Attached Image This is not a system, I can't describe it. It is similar to Elliot Waves, I am just playing / trying to find those points where to enter and quickly exit when I am not sure about direction, or the trend seems to be over. Take a look at point C and E has the bars top not increasing, it is visible has no steam the micro trend, should stop it there and stay out. In case of after C, I would stay out around 8 candles, after E around 11 candles with high leveraged positions. I am doing high leverage only if I found safe according to daily, weekly chart

My "system" -if I can name it system is like this: It is a high leverage, trend following , price action system ) Name it better if you can, and this is my favorite currency pair. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Marked with 3x up when I would enter in trade, and 1x down when exit if I would trade only on chart and wouldn't see the FF's calendar with event results, news, so only the chart part. In the latest weeks I wouldn't do any short, I would stay away from market instead. In practice I did a hard short and now I recovered that looses...but leak of discipline... How should be this system vs this PI like system? On strong long entry I would use 30:1 leverage ( my max at Dukas, because of weekends). In this case isn't any day a trade day, or should look at 4h, 5 min chart to "do something", but lets stick to plan: I would stay out ASAP the trend gives signal it is moving counter trend and once the pulllback is coming back I would enter enain in trend direction: not a single counter trend trade.

Matheszabi You need to respect the thread owner spydermam. Open a new thread for yourself then traders will discuss your trading philosophy there, not here. (It seems your trading method sounds good) Trusting you are a mature trader.

Hi Spyderman Thanks for reply my last post 257. I don't know will G be returned? I followed him until he left. He is v. good buy just wonder will novices able to follow his many trading philosophies? Yours is easy to follow due simplicity. Maybe due it is a Daily tf - it fits my trading style. Overall I can understand your PI trading method. I am still figuring the histogram crossing 0 for entry - how soon vs. wait for pull back? For the initial 300 pips emergency exit - I am still unable to accept this philosophy, maybe due to "old" habit to set at the opposite low As for exit, again due "old' habit, I use BE (like G does). Not quite understand the trailing stop. Actually never use training and EA before. Cheers

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Spyderman Following your PI, so far my E/U survives. I think my 1st entry is not right - should be at the high of y candle, instead x candle 2nd entry should be ok at the high of z candle. So now wait for next pull back if any. Frankly, wonder when to exit? I missed a few pull-back entries on GBP pairs on Fri. Did you manage to get some? I will set a pending order on GU at the low of x candle. Comment pls? Cheers

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Looks like you got the right idea. y and z. Yeah I had an entry Friday on E/G. When 2 exit. Either when the MA's cross back over or I'm taking an earlier exit when price crosses back over the 22MA plus 15 pips. Once price moves against your trade that much you're usually seeing a change of trend, or at least entering a consolidation. Here's an example on how its so hard to know when to exit. On G/A I took the exit on a couple of orders when price crossed back up over the 22MA. Now it's moved back down. No matter when you decide to exit, sometimes it will turn out to be too soon, sometimes you waited too long. Just pick what seems right to you and be consistent. Then monitor as you go along and make adjustments as you see fit.

Hello followers, Thanks to “Spyderman” for sharing his trade account. Before I traced the thread of “Graeme”, I used already a similar method on daily entries in a longterm account. Some guys did ask questions how to handle SL and BE and when get exit? We can watch the price-action (please refer to MATAF.com) for hourly, daily and actual pip-movements (price-action). There you can switch also to the correlation matrix to watch how the pairs (majors and minors) interact. Longterm price-action and direction will be indicated in the weekly and monthly chart too. Actually e.g. the E/U has a daily price-action at the average of appr. 90 Pips/daily. At thursdays we even had have currently a price-action of appr. 120-140 pips. Similar price-actions of other pairs you will find at mataf.com indicated. These are the overall price-areas to consider within which ranges price will move after entry. Price will need space to breath and be care to place e.g. the SL in an appropriate distance by trend following, before a fast adapted BE will kill any trade quickly. If we trade not only with a single order by using pendings placed in a grid and in regard to the daily movements, we will get the chances to catch the trend followed by multiple pendings orders. Pendings are not dangerous as long as they are not triggered. If price will retrace and it will do certainly, we would have the chance also to reenter orders after a pullback, as long as the trend will still be stable. Beginners mostly did not have patience to follow longterm movements. During the starting period of a longterm account, the account will not immediatley run into profit. Use a portfolio to simulate, what will happen (worst case scenarios) by using multiple orders (fictive orders, pendings) and try fictive scenarios with different pairs, how and if a market and price will hypothetically move during a certain session and period, especially when price or any market move against you. I call it risk-management, because we only can consider and calculate losses in advance, anyway we cannot predict the profit-performance of any order. In a portfolio (e.g. spreadsheet) the equity and balance will tell us realtime and in advance, when the orders will not perform proper. It will protect your account in advance, before you get burned out. Don´t think about profits, calculate fictive losses at the maximum and you will trade relaxed. Not only impatient intraday-traders can try to work with partial-profit-orders. Even intraday scalpers can manage orders by partial profit to let alive daily orders for swing and longterm. It depends on your daily money-management in regard to the actual equity and balance in your portfolio. Your risks or entries (e.g. pendings) prepared should not decrease in the worst case your already generated profits (balance). I define “balance” in the term of realized orders (already taken profit), be it closed orders or orders protected by SL. Despite of that, the equity in the MT4-terminal shows only the unrealized profit (risk area). I prefer to trade only within the area of equity and balance and I try and intend to let the balance grow continously. Your RR should be adapted accordingly. Concerning exits, we do not know in advance, how far a trade will perform in profit. We can watch the weekly and daily support and resistance areas. The price action will slow down, indicated by smaller candles in the faster TFs. In regard to daily movements, positions in the long run and in take profit should be then protected by SL closer. Next week some pairs (in the weekly-chart) are closed to support and resistance levels in sideward movements. We will watch, what will happen, especially in the faster timeframes. Trade well Over60

Guys, I hate to bring this up, but feel it necessary. I certainly don't want to be a Thread-Nazi. I respect everyone's opinion and trading style. That being said though, we're getting a lot of postings that are diverging from the purpose of the thread. This is not a price action strategy. This is not even a strictly technical strategy. I guess if I had to define it, PI is a technical way to visualize what is happening with the global market sentiment. I am trying to capitalize on long term trends. Long term trends are not caused by price action, or moving averages. They are not ended by price action or moving averages. Long term trends are caused and ended by market sentiment and the resulting order flow...pure and simple. A moving average, for one, can help you identify on a chart, when trends are happening. Not when they will, or if they will continue...but when they are currently happening. We can then use that information to decide to jump on the trend and ride it out. We do not use s/l's as such. (Only an initial emergency s/l) We do not use t/p's as such. We let market sentiment tell us when to exit. That sentiment, for me, is expressed with by economic news or by the reaction of price to the same indicators that told us we wanted to get into a particular trend. I encourage anyone with a strategy or method they are fond of to start a thread. You're more than welcome to post a link to it on this thread. Buy out of respect for the time I've put into this and for the benefit of those trying to understand and follow what we're doing here, I would appreciate it if we don't diverge too much. Please don't think this was aimed at anyone in particular, I just thought that it was time to mention it in view of many of the posts that we've had. Thanks.

Dear MM, Sorry. It does not make sense and I do not intend to offer charts public in advance, how I trade and about my forecasts. What do you expect? That’s yours. I do not intend to give any advice in that manner. Create a portfolio and calculate your forecasts in the markets for yourself. The message and the method of using a portfolio, I posted should be clear and for common convienence. I do not have a crystall ball to predict any actual market movement. Watch, act and calculate your risks, consider worst case scenarios concerning your accout before you enter any order. That’s all. Trade well Over60

No worries

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Spyderman Based on your post 291 plus previous some, I think you are a season, prof, financial trader. Reason - for one I presently lack of economic / financial knowledge and experience, thus I am not able to read or even sense my own country market, not to say the global market probably due to my past years of technical background Also you do not use SL and TP - this is an incredible! I think many traders are unable to accept your philosophy because the normal tradings shared by others always require SL and TP. For me I have SL (ops). Pls. bear with me if I have repeatedly asked the same questions I appreciate your time to share and clarify your trading philosophy. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thanks. I may be slow but coming to there I got it too. I think the correct entry should be the high of y candle instead x. I had it earlier (ops). Do you use the lower (H4/h1) tf for entry? (sorry to mention here because my 1st entry was happened to base on the H4 when the moment I screened the charts) Assuming on G/A you have 10 entries made. When you closed 2 entries, you were just left the other 8 open/run and not worry the trend might turn?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
No I only had 2 entries on G/A. Both got closed.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Let's see...Professional means you're paid to do something...so...perhaps. Full-time...no. Bloomberg.com - Ransquawk.com I think many times s/l and t/p become a crutch for our trading. There was a reason you entered a trade. Get out when that reason changes, not at some pre-defined level or price. People talk about support and resistance, and they definitely come into play. But take a look at the JPY crosses that last several months. No support/resistance line, fibonacci or ATR is going to hold up to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saying he's going to aggressively devalue the Yen

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TRADING * Price either goes up or down * No one knows what will happen next * Keep losses small and let winners run * POSITION SIZE = RISK / STOP LOSS * The reason you entered has no bearing on the outcome of your trade * You can control the size of your loss (skill) but you can't control the size of your win (luck) * You need to know when to pick up your chips and cash them in Expectancy = (Probability of Win * Average Win) - (Probability of Loss * Average Loss) You cannot control the probabilities of wining or losing You cannot control your average win size The only part of the equation that you can control is your average loss size PRICE ACTION "Now, 2 patterns of market behavior happen on a regular basis: 1) the price breaks to new high's (or low's) 2) the price reverses from new high's (or low's) They happen regardless of time frame They are phenomena that can be exploited without the fear if found out by others, that they might cease to exist.” - H. Rearden 1) Price will either breakout of the high, low or both of the previous bar 2) Price will not breakout of the previous bar You cannot reduce it any further. Anything else complicates the issue. ENTERING A TRADE You either decide to: 1) Wait and do not enter a trade 2) Trade a breakout 3) Trade a reversal Those are your ONLY 3 options That is all you need to know about trading

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I might disagree with this If I enter a trade on the Aud/Usd tonight at 9:30:15 CST right after the RBA announces a 25 basis points rise in their cash rate and profit from the resulting 70 pips pop to the upside, I have a pretty strong feeling that the outcome is going to be tied to the reason I entered the trade. Actually, I think you did reduce it down further, earier: "* Price either goes up or down" The trick is figuring out which, when, and for how long. So I can't enter a trade without a chart in front of me?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
After Friday close you had 2,037.8% not closed return. You haven't closed any position as you told. In 1 trading day down to: 1,403.6%. It is still very good in 2 month, but can be worse. For this reason I don't like those trend following system which exits to later out. I just lost on that way a lot more than close in negative. For me need to be an oversold / overbought signal, and indicator, or a price action. I do prefer to jump out and wait, keep my margins free and let me jump in in whatever I want , when I see opportunity (in weekly, daily or maybe 4h chart, not lower). I wrote a Strategy (an EA for Dukascopy platform),after I was kicked from this thread. Like every EA can be optimised for a known period, so can be ultra profitable for last 1 year and useless in the next month: because there are new conditions with candles, which doesn't give entry/exit signal. I don't want to tell you to waste time or money to write one, there is one software for manual trading( not free), but I would spend a few time to test it when I see a -600% in 1 day. Maybe at one day it worth it. Good luck.

Here's an example of a Aussie cash rate announcement news trade from the release on October 2. No trading breakouts...no trading reversals. Trading market sentiment. Not what were doing here, but you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket... News came out the RBA was dropping their rate by 25 basis points. Price actually pulled back a little, and then shot down 75 pips over the next 90 mins. It dropped another 200+ pips over the next 5 days. Don't think the market cared if AudUsd was overbought, oversold, or anything else an indicator will tell you. What it cared about was the fact that the interest rate dropped in Aus and the smart money wanted out.

For those interested...the next AUD rate announcement comes out in 2 1/2 hours...Do you know where your children are?

Yeah, you're right. Announcement came out as forecasted. But as you mentioned we are seeing some nice movement, really across the board. We'll see how the day progresses. Just got up so haven't had a chance to look at the news over night to see what's been happening.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Very nice Spyderman! Really like what you have here......

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I mean taking crosses and pullbacks or just pullbacks......I have made a quick visual backtest, sometimes you missed some initial good moves but sometimes taking only pullbacks makes you avoid a lot of losses due to ranging periods. As always, not easy to say what is the best. Do you have any conclusion about this? Thank you Cheers

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks 4x, That means a lot. Hope we can continue the success.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Yeah I agree. I've definitely held off on entries on some of the ranging pairs until a pullback confirmation. NzdChf is a good example. On others, like when I got stopped out of the E/J and G/J a couple of weeks ago, I got right back in at the earliest signal. So, as with most things, you definitely have to use some discretion.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I am sure we can my friend....the only way we can fail is if we give up......

Hi Spyderman Thanks for your generosity on sharing this simple powerful idea, I hope it continues with lots of other trends. Just set up a demo and got everything ready to go, probably going to kick of just as the trends change ! Anyhow its long term and we need to jive the system some stress and look at the outcomes. Can I ask are you able to share the MA trailing stop ? May the trends never stop Thanks

If you were trading strictly off of the cross then yes. Some are waiting for the first pullback/continuation to enter, especially on pairs that are coming out of a ranging area. No, I don't currently have A/C on my radar. It was pretty choppy back in November when I started this and really not setup to trade. I've put it back on my platform but not taking anything on it yet.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi Spiderman, This is from you froma previous post.. : As far as the close...you can see in the attached chart, I use an ea that trails my stop in relation to the 22 MA. Here on Eur/Gbp I have it set to trail the MA by 15 pips. The 22 MA right now is at .8411. The trailing stop is at .8396. As price moves up the stop will too. If price moves against me then it will close the trades. Is this the way you still make on open trades? I read that you got SL out on GJ and another pair... wondering if you modified the way to put SL since that day. Thanks for you help again Spiderman, Mfinab,

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Sorry my english please. Firt of all thanks spyderman for his work. i'm trying to trade in 1H chart....and there realy is a problem to control all open tradeі. maybe is a good idea to make EA..... Why i'm not using 1D .....i dont have a lot of money. Spyderma, and others, what can you suggest for 1H trading? (sory if i missed this in topic)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Actually at that time I was using a 300 pips trailing stop. That's what took me out of G/J and E/J. Since then I've switched to the trailing MA. Had I been using it at that time the E/J would not have closed. The G/J would have.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I can't suggest anything because I don't trade that low of TF with this. I just don't think you're going to get the trends. Too choppy. If you can't invest in daily charts, try finding a broker with a micro account that lets you trade $100 positions. At 100:1 leverage you'd only be putting up a dollar for each one.

Good to see your pips growing A quick question on entry. Let us assume it is whatever pair here. Upon closing 1, the histogram 1 is seen crossing below 0. So today upon the opening 2, based on your trading rules, one can take an entry for short? Cheers

Hello SPYDERMAN, Can you explain how exactly you define your entry? Is it taking the daily closing price in or do you consider the highlights? Thanks! Best regards Oyapoke

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I set my pending entry orders at the start of a new trading day based on the close of the previous day. Especially if you're looking at the MACD, it will repaint during the course of the day. Once the bar closes though, it will be fixed.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I've been looking through some other instruments on my MT4 platform that could be tradable. I'm adding some energies, indexes, commodities and metals in. I'm going to monitor them and if I see some likely entries, go in with a lower position size. I still want to know why the underlying is moving/trending, not just enter because an indicator says thus and so.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
This is where things start to get a bit murky...... when fundamentals start creeping into a mechanical rule based system things start slipping, you start to analyze too much and those nice emotion free executions start to get clouded by doubt. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Yeah I hear you. There's a fine line there. But I've said from the start, I'm using the mechanical to tell me what the fundamentals are dictating. There's always an underlying fundamental reason why the indicators have moved.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
No, personally I leave the initial pending order where it was. That's where the market paused, and I want to see it break that area.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Caillou, thanks for replying, I really believe on that kind of system but I think we just got caught at the end of strong trend on most major pair.... It will take days and weeks to get back in positive ''I guess''. Spiderman is using this system since long time ago, he could tell us what he think about this? Like now, EURCAD, price as moved below MA22, so I guess we should get out? am I right Spiderman? or we wait until we get the real signal to go short? Ok, if we wait to get out long from EURCAD, do we need to wait those 3 criterias? 1: MA Cross 2: MACD Cross 3: Reversal Candle (breakout) Or we just apply #1 and #2 to get out long and go short? This is what I dont understand yet... Again, thank you Spiderman to always be active and disciplined like you are on this thread and your account. &lt;------ This give me confident to follow you and trust your system. Mfinab

hey look eurcad is in fibo 38.2 level, so maybe waith for decision...U can switch on 4h and monitoring it but dont think that at close us session and asia we will have solution I think U can trade with this trend fallow system on 4h timeframe with a lot of succes and U will fell this system its only may opinion thug

Dead right Caillou. This may be a trend change but many may turn right back around. The Jpy pairs aren't even close to the 22 MA yet.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Sorry to hear that mfinab. The reality is, that is to be expected to a degree. I too started out in the red...still am based solely on my balance. It's the equity from the longer term successful trends that keep it positive. You haven't had time to build up those orders. Reread the beginning of post #1 and #5.

Hi Spyderman I am trading with a very small account because I find that I am not careful enough with a demo account. My first ever 100 pips were made on the USDJPY and this made me feel like a winner after all the losses. Due to the time zone I only check my charts the next morning early and sometimes it helps me better to analyze the situation then. Thank you for your patients with us. Are you still busy with the order flow study? A 14 page pdf is attached if you are interested which was a free study that was done in 2008

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Good deal JMCL, Yeah I'm still working on incorporating the order flow mentality. Going through an extensive course now. Really helps the confidence level having some feel for what's going on behind the charts. Like the JPY crosses. We're seeing quite a retracement, but all the global macro sentiment still points to a weak Yen. We shall see.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I've set my closing EA with a 15 pip buffer, so they will close if price crosses the MA by 15 pips. I've had several close but the JPY pairs are still going. My E/A isn't showing close to the MA yet.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Yeah, I'm getting pounded right now as well. The Euro is definitely taken a hit. Draghi's words this week were not taken well. I would not be suprised to see the Eur crosses start heading south.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Well just looking at the chart shown, it looks like I might have a nice entry spot just above that 1.5315 recent high. You've got some nice movement and you may be catching some action at the 1.5300 mark. I'd still want to look back a bit at previous market movement and study what's going on with the currencies involved. Looks like Gbp/Aud...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks for your comments. In addition to the trading method, one should possess a well understanding in the currencies of the countries involved, if I read your comments in above and previous posts. THIS is the area I am weak, or rather to say I need to "catch up" a lot (yes it is G/A)

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I am definitely of the mind set that understanding the underlying market sentiment is of great importance. I'm moving more and more to an Oder Flow mentality.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Don't mind to share... what is the "order flow?" A trend (may be not)?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Spyderman With the chart, is line 1 the appropriate entry? Regards

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I would be at line 2

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Order flow is just that. It's the flow of the buy and sell orders that come into the market. Every time you enter a buy or sell order, you contribute to the order flow. Now you and I don't trade enough to even pretend to cause a blip in the market. But there's big money out there...central banks, hedge funds, sovereign nations...that can and do. Or if you get enough smaller players all doing the same thing. Take a look at the chart here for Usd/Cad this morning. No fibs, trend lines, pin bars, or for that matter "PI" moving averages that caused that price action There was a couple of news releases that caused an massive influx of orders into the market. A lot of money decided in a short period of time that it would be a good idea to be long US dollar and short Loonie. (Made a nice straddle spread trade on that release this morning too...but that's another story... ) That's order flow. Sometimes its quick and over, sometimes it lasts for weeks or months (Yen weakness)

Spydie great thread great method plus your one of the few who has the courage to run a linked explorer for your system.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Absolutely, I've given a lot of thought to it. And it's one of the things I want to discuss on this thread. There's definitely a need to adjust that aspect and others. I've been looking into maybe trailing the stop on a 14 MA rather than the 22. The problem is, obviously, that's going to take you out of a lot of trends that were just retracing. Take a look at the AudJpy below. The 14 MA (gold) would have closed this trade out, and it appears now that it might be turning back up. Whereas the CadJpy would not have closed. My "market sentiment" mentality tells me that if I'm in the CadJpy, I should be in the AudJpy. The other problem causing the wide swing in equity is the position size. I'm basing this on % of account equity. So at the beginning of a long trend like the Yen crosses, the lot size may be at 1 for example. By the time the trend gets to the top/bottom the lot size might be up to 5. So when things turn, the negative effect is magnified before the stop or trend change is triggered. I could establish a lot size for a given string at the beginning (in above example 1 lot) and keep it set throughout. The problem with that is that the string might last several months and the account size (hopefully) will have increased to the point where 1 lot no longer makes much sense. These are definite adjustments that need to be made going forward and welcome anyone's ideas.

Hi Spydie, Love your thread. A couple of possibilities re building your balance while your equity grows. 1) Pay yourself regularly, ie weekly or monthly, some fraction that makes sense based on the growth dynamics of your Equity Heat. 2) Set a high Limit order, eg 1000 pips or more, to Take Profit. This will not be hit on modest runs, but for super runs there will be a new crop of pips coming soon behind from add-on positions. This latter approach is like harvesting coffee as opposed to harvesting corn. With coffee there will be 3 or 4 harvests each season, but with corn you are always sweating the weather. Obviously any approach will "cost" opportunity pips, but many will be lost anyway. Just trying to be sensibly greedy.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
hmmm. Have to think about that. Could even do that on every other position or whatever. Still need to figure out the lot size increase as equity increases. Of course if I was employing what you're talking about I might switch to % of balance.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Yes....yes .....it is heading to 60 alright...they forgot the 1 in front......160.00!!!! That is the reason I am 100% technical trader....... This can influence someones trading......trade what you see.....if it decides and when to go to 60 we will see it make the move.....we will have time to jump in.....it will not go to 60 one shot...."you can't hide an elephant"........

--- 帖子 #406 ---
So thus far our options for a better exit are: Tightening our trailing stop. If hit prematurely will close all orders and we have to start over if trend resumes. If trend is changing...great. Coffee Harvest Set a high T/P on orders (maybe only some orders). If hit it would mean you have a lot of other positions under the threshold that would still be trailing at the 22MA. Down side is your closing the door on potential 2000 pip positions. (I currently have 9 positions over 1000 pips.) This idea is growing on me. Thanks Albina Grande. Any other ideas.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
7500 pips to the good today. What a roller coaster. One thing to do that now with a relatively small account. Could you imagine the sphincter factor if your account was 100K. Gotta get this exit figured out.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi Spyderman, I think finding the "right" answer might be in the eye of the pip holder, it might come down to what makes to feel good as opposed to what makes me feel good. I think whilst in a growing stage Albina Grande's idea seems like a good one, but again, at what level will you be happy to take pips off the table??, maybe another idea is, we are entering the trade with a breakout of the high of a recent pullback(long) so why not trail your stop at the cooresponding swing low that has completed just prior to the breakout. As to the impending sphincter excercise, if you are starting small and building up to it maybe the effect will lesson as you get used to it, but right now, i couldn't imagine dealing with such swings in equity. Love the thread, keep it up cheers Geoff

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Could also close 1/2 of every position when it reaches a certain milestone. Then could go 1/2 again. If you used 1000 pips you'd continue to have the same t/p amount...1/2 the size, twice the pips...

--- 帖子 #410 ---
You're right. Everyone is going to have to use what they're comfortable with. I like the low of pullback idea in general. Problem is, sometimes the pullback is so small (maybe just a few pips) and for a short duration (1 day) that a stop there wouldn't make as much sense as on a deeper pullback that lasted several days. Especially if you moved a lot of positions up that tight.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
How about volatility based trailing stop ? So far its working somewhat good, just messing my position sizing because I made stupid deciosion to atjust it to latest volatility.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
So how exactly are you implementing that.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I enter trade and my stop is trailing based on ATR.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi Uberteh Could you please share us a chart about where would be your stops based on ATR. I dont really care which charts you'll choose for example. Thank you Mfinab,

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Why would u need a chart for that , For example ATR 14 shows u value 200, that can be your trailing stop. Exact values and amounts to use depends on style of system, your goals etc etc. I'm not trading this system and dont know what values could be optimal or if idea good for what spyder wants at all, just an idea then it comes to trend trading systems exits.

Glad to hear that Coffee Harvest is of interest. Right now I am having computer problems - Carnivales in Panama, but I will try to put together some examples based on EJ and a hyper aggressive, related strategy where the differences hopefully can stand out.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hi Spydy, A couple of graphics to look at related to Coffee Harvest. The first shows a schematic of the problem: How to lock in as much profit as possible while sacrificing as little “potential” profit as is practical, recognizing that some give back is unavoidable or even desirable in anticipation of further Equity Growth. Attached Image The second is a look at EJ for the 6 week period Nov 15, 2012 to Feb 1, 2013. I have highlighted the important results because unfortunately the Equity/ Balance curves are quite faint. The Limits run from 500 to 2000 in 500 pip intervals. In general the results here parallel my previous impressions with other pairs over the last 2 years where for Surges ONLY , such as the Yen pairs at present, a Limit of 750 to 1000 seems to work fairly well. Of course Beauty is in the Eyes of the Beholder. There are obvious trade offs. As Your Balance builds, it does so at the expense of your Equity. Que Sorpresa!!! The charts should be self explanatory. The Strategy is similar to yours - adding on to a trend on Daily Charts. The details are not so important. It is the concept that I am after. For this simulation the initial Balance is 50K. The Balance build up is high lighted at the lower Right corner of each Thumb. You can see the shrinkage in Equity value on the Right hand side as well. 500 is clearly not enough and 1500 may not be practical. Of course the Limit can always be adjusted on the fly. Working with Daily charts gives plenty of time for reflection. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Finally, every pair and Surge as it evolves needs to be seen as a new phenomenon. The above is strictly intended to be seen as guidance. The smoother the Trend the easier the Management and the better the results. Hope this helps to clarify my thoughts. For sure I do not want to distract from your terrific Thread with lots of questions NOT directly related to your content. So please Guys, as Mrs AG says,- What you see is what you get! Albina Grande

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thanks much AG. I'll look these over. I certainly don't mind anyone asking questions if you don't mind answering. At least as it relates to nailing down a more profitable exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
The more I look at this and study the charts, I come to feel that the problem isn't with coming up with a new exit strategy. I think the trailing MA 22 will work fine. There's a few cases on a steep parabolic rise/fall where a strong reversal has to travel quite a ways before hitting the MA, but we'll deal with that. I am going to adjust my lot sizes though. I'm switching to a 2 ADR initial stop with a 3% of equity of risk. I'll see if that gives me a nice balance between lot size and room to let the trades move.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
With a method like this, keeping your risk as a percentage of your equity is fine when you're catching a trend, but when it starts to slow down, the latter positions are so large in relation to your former ones, that with a sizable retracement, your equity curve will hit the skids. Maybe you can consider standard swing trading money management involving keeping your risk fixed, or reduce it as you pyramid into positions to protect yourself from such volatility swings in equity. It may not result in the equity explosions that dazzle your eyes, but it goes a long way to reducing volatility and preserving capital. Additionally, you're flitting from one exit method to another, partially due to all the input you are getting about how they can be 'improved'. With a method where you are trailing your profits - letting your winners run, whilst cutting your losses short - you should be coming out ahead with a decent strategy. Any exit method is going to have those sloppy exits that make you think twice about what you're doing, but such exits will be the furthest thing from your mind when you end up nabbing those memorable ones that allow you to capture the meat of a very large trend. I guess what I'm trying to say is that no exit method is perfect, and that is something you have to accept if you want to commit to a strategy and trade it unwaveringly. Regards, xXTrizzleXx

--- 帖子 #423 ---
What do you think about, not to increase now the lotsize regarding equity risk (3%) by a larger lotsize in reference to a single new position of a pair, instead of reinvest and share the risk to multiple positions? I´d like to prefer to stable multiple orders with equal lotsize for more flexibility, to harvest profits in TP, especially in the long run. Anyway I can try to scalp a daily move with higher lotsize (depends on the pair and already taken profit), using partial profit, very closed to actual movements. But this additional intraday method depends on personal skills and experience, to enter a scalp order intraday during a strong momentum with a higher lotsize, to let an order alive after partial profit in the long run. Might not be match with the longterm-strategy in generell. However, the bigger problem seems to me, how to protect realized profits in the longterm run. It should be known, that we have to consider drawdowns (by market fluctuations/movements), which are indicated by experts by a common value of 25-30% in reference to the equity. Trading with basket longterm, the leverage will influence the account heavy and strongly. Weekly movements/retracements (appr. 350 pips movement) can move the equity very fast up and down &gt; 25-30% equity, even more. On the other hand, no position will live infinitely. In addition with a position closed in profit (at an overheat homerun), I will get the chance to reinvest the profit be it completely or partially for any appropriate pair, if the profit has to be protected (partially) by SL. If I e.g. will close or protect by SL an order in profit and I would this order immediately substitute, how did I loss or win pips in the further progress under equal conditions? The risk would remain equal, despite of costs. Independent from a.m. thoughts, as more pips any order performed, as closer the SL could be adapted. The SL protect the realized profit. If price retrace to SL , what do you think, I can place in advance pending orders? Having in mind and assuming, if I will start e.g. with an account of $5,000. That I´d call my risk-capital or invest. First of all, I have to protect the invest in the starting period using e.g. a RR of 1-2% in the starting period. Assuming the account will take profit and grow constantly up to $10,000. Does it makes sense for retail-traders to trade at this edge already with an increased lotsize? What about the starting-invest e.g of $5,000? For myself, I´d decide not to deal furtheron with the starting-invest. I will protect or remove (also partially) the starting-account, which remains untouchable to come below, would make me happy and relaxed. If not, especially for beginners, I would not challenge the risk to touch or deceed the starting account after take profit by higher risks. I´d like to protect my invest partially. Let´s start and repeat the game again and again, but always after take profit. I´d never risk my starting/basic-account. Maybe this thoughts are not to complicated and oldfashioned… Trade well Over60

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Trizzle, Appreciate your input. I totally agree with your points. As I mentioned earlier I definitely think the equity swing problem is much more an issue with lot sizing rather then exit method. I don't really consider what I'm trying to do as 'flitting' from one to another. This strategy is not yet 3 months old, which is nothing for a long term strategy. There are going to need to be refinements or adjustments for me, at least till I come up with what I consider a balanced approach. I'm comfortable right now with the 22MA exit. Little bit quicker exit than entry, which I like. But the lot sizing is still a question I'm thinking about. Will do that at greater length over the weekend. Thanks again for your input and keep it coming.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hey 60. If I understand you correctly, you're suggesting to enter just once at the beginning and ride that one position to the end, perhaps at a higher % lot size. That's totally up to you if that's how you want to play it. Personally, I like compounding/stacking of trades. When we hit that long trend, it obviously makes up for a lot of the losers. If I was entering only once at the beginning, I might hit many losing trades right off that would be harder to compensate for with just one position in the favorable trades. Again, if I'm reading you right, I think you're referring to unrealized profit rather than realized . If it's realized it's already been closed and is on your balance side, so not effected by market movement. If we tighten those s/l's too much or take profit early, we may transfer profit from unrealized to realized sooner but sacrifice the upside potential. As far as the rest, everyone has to come up with a money management plan that fits their trading style and financial situation.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
You and many traders are truly prof and/or experienced. If you may, in fact something mentioned I am not quite understood. What you mean by "lot size" vs. "exit" vs. "equity problem" (how?) ?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Msia, As you've been keeping up with the thread, I'm sure you've seen the huge swings in equity (unrealized profit) that have gone on with this system. That's the problem. Most people couldn't or wouldn't want to handle an account that goes from 3,000 equity...up to 30,000 equity...then down to 6,000...up to 16,000...all in the space of a couple of months. We've discussed closing our trades "exiting" before we they have a chance to retrace and loose equity. But no matter where you decide to exit, you're going to give pips back to the market in swing trading. You just can't perfectly hit the exact tops or bottoms. But the exit is not what is creating the equity swing problem, in my and other's opinions. It's the lot size or position size of the trade. Many if not most, increase their position size as their account grows. If you do that with this strategy, lets say you end up with 14 positions in UsdJpy, like I have now. The first position you took has a relatively low lot size. As time goes by and you stack positions, you may well increase your lot size (assuming your account has been growing). The problem is now those recent positions are worth a lot more per pip of movement then the earlier positions. So when the trend reaches it's top/bottom and retraces the negative effect from those recent large positions is exaggerated in comparison to the earlier positions. Hence the discussion on whether to increase lot size as you stack positions in a given trend, or do you establish a lot size for that cycle and use the same one throughout the trend until all are closed.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi, Just to add a bit to the problem about swings and equity drawdown, I was thinking on below lines: Say we spot a change in long term trend, lets suppose upwards, and we take our 1st position with a stop loss of 300 pips( this could be whatever you are comfortable with).. As the trend establishes in a week or two, we add 2nd position with a stop loss of say 300 again... And we add a 3rd position in say week 3, again with a stop loss of 300 pips.. Now fast forward to week 6, we've not added any positions, so we have 3 positions and may be few pips and lot of equity under control. Suppose we see a possible trend reversal( now I know it is not easy to spot or conform such a thing), but in my mind I worry that markets are about to reverse and would affect my equity. At this point what if I move stop loss of my very 1st position to as close as 50pip(could be whatever you are comfortable with), 2nd position at 75pips and 3rd at 100 pips. With this, if the long term trend reverses in real, my 1st position with longest run and most pips would close out first, bagging most profit. 2nd would close out after this one with some profit and 3rd would close out last with may be with little profit. All in all I am thinking on the concept of protecting the positions in order they were opened. This way, if there is trend reversal we might save equity and pips. If trend doesn't reverse all the way, may be we'll still be in the trade with 2nd or 3rd or both positions and would still have bagged the pips and equity from 1st. Once the trend resumes we can always add 4th and 5th position and increase our pips and equity. I hope I am clear in my explanation and don't offend or upset anyone.... All the best all...

--- 帖子 #430 ---
At first glance, not sure I'd want to close that first position first. That's where my muscle is, and if trend resumes I can't duplicate that equity with new positions. As far as bagging most pips if trend reverses. of your positions are all the same lot size, you'd bag the same total pips no matter what order you closed them in. Unless I'm doing the math wrong in my head.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
We are taking same lot size on each position. And yes you can't duplicate that equity with new positions, but you wont' loose that equity either if you've bagged it by closing your position. It is better to have muscle which is safe, rather than muscle without any energy (joking, no offence..) I know the first position is the muscle, but if the trend reverses and you have all your stops at around 300 pips (say where MA crosses), you might have positions multiplied by 300pips (distance to 200MA) from current high. That would be loosing 900pips. If we did how I was proposing, you'd only loose 50+75+100=225, which seems a lot of pips, but if you have more positions, you'll be able to save lot many pips, especially if you change how tight the stop losses are. And this is lot less compared to 900 pips. And well the equity which would be washed away by 900 pips. I hope I am making sense... unlesss I've completely lost it on a friday..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
No, I agree that you'd save pips by tightening the stops. I was referring to the order that you tighten the stops: Let's do some math. Hey, its Friday Assume market moves up 200 pips between positions. Scenario 1 is what you mentioned...Oldest position has tightest s/l (50,75,100) Sceanrio 2 is reversed...Newest position has tightest s/l 1st position - no change 2nd position opened - 1st position is +200 pips 3rd position opened - 1st position is +400 pips, 2nd position is +200 Market uncertainty or whatever and you tighten stops - 1st position is +600, 2nd is +400, 3rd is +200 Market drops 50 pips: Scenario 1 = 1st position closed for 550 pip profit, 2nd position +350, 3rd position +150 Scenario 2 = 1st position +550 pips, 2nd position +350 pips, 3rd position closed for 150 pip profit Market drops 25 pips more: Scenario 1 = 1st position already closed for 550 pip profit, 2nd position closed for 325 pips profit, 3rd position +125 Scenario 2 = 1st position +525 pips, 2nd position closed for 325 pips profit, 3rd position already closed for 150 pip profit Market drops 25 pips more: Scenario 1 = 1st position already closed for 550 pip profit, 2nd position closed for 325 pips profit, 3rd position closed for 100 pips profit. Total profit of scenario 1 = 975 pips Scenario 2 = 1st position closed for 500 pips profit, 2nd position already closed for 325 pips profit, 3rd position already closed for 150 pip profit Total profit of scenario 2 = 975 pips

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Only for clarification and to avoid missunderstandings. Sorry, I did use mistaken the term “staple orders” instead of “stack orders”. Please replace the terms. The difference between “realized” and “unrealized” profit, I define as follow. “realized profit” means positions closed or protected with SL &gt; entry. With other words: The equity concerning and with incorporated open orders is protected partially. The MT4 terminal report is a little bit confusing, because it does indicate only closed orders in the equity-curve, but not considering and incorporating the floating P/L of still open orders. The term “unrealized profit” means, that open positions are not already protected by a stop &gt; entry (positions are only protected by emergency stops &lt; entry). Trade well Over60

so this Feb, the system incurred 50% DD of the whole account? is the MM a bit aggressive here?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
50% DD on the floating equity, yes. Not fun. Of course if there hadn't been such a huge run up in the equity, you wouldn't see the DD. As far as aggressive MM, that's for each one to decide based on their risk tolerance. Personally I don't view risking 1-3% of account equity with a trailing stop overly aggressive. Nor is trailing the stop by a couple of ADR. Especially for a smaller account size. If I was dealing with tens of thousands of dollars then I would personally want to drop the risk down.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
thanks for your reply. of course, the risk comes with your astounding return. if DD vs Return = 1:2, that's well acceptable. btw, in 2013, did you increase your lotsize with the growth of your capital?

That's one of the aspects I've really been struggling with if you've read through the recent posts. I have been increasing lot size as equity increases. We'll see how my current solution goes over the next weeks.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
dude...I wish I had your attitude.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Greed and fear man. Take your pick.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
It seems to me a question and calculation of RMM to increase and adapt the lotsize. It would depend on realized profit in the account, taken into account actually a DD of appr. 30-50% in the equity at the maximum, also regarding the performance of every pair in the basket and the entire account. What do think about to reduce the distance of placing and stacking multiple orders in the appropriate pairs, which run in the mainstream? From my point of view, you would have intraday more flexibility with stacked multiple orders to act. Anyway with increased lotsize, you would be in the position to realize partial profit, but the disadvantage will be the leverage and risk after entry. Trade well my friend Over60

All my CadJpy positions hit their trailing stop today to close. Other JPY crosses are closing the gap between price and the trailing MA. We'll see if they exit or head back up.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I try to understand... so many posts that I read after your above reply are "so advance" to me! I might be a slow learner in understanding trading. Thanks for taking time to reply.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Why all C/J pairs as far as opened in Nov 2012 were closed, but you have left other J pairs open (many are further than Nov 2012)? I have thought C/J could be a good 'signal' (hit below MA22) to close up all J pairs. Otherwise, even for just a day, it will cost you thousand pips due to many opening J pairs (if prices go down). May be I lack of understanding the trailing concept to understand your exit method. Pls. share your thought. Thanks. p. s. But I do see your GBP pairs are producing profit

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I have been busy following another method but pop in here to see the pip total; system should be short GBP-JPY due to the cross-over, right?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
That would be correct, however, many including myself are waiting for the first pullback signal after the cross as a type of confirmation. I will especially do that on these Yen crosses. Global market sentiment just is not leaning to buying the Yen. AudJpy and EurJpy have closed as well.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hi, Spyderman: what lesson could we draw from this DD? I see these loss are not from yesterday price movements (they are in fact good to profit from). too many losing positions accumulated seemed the main reason?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Charvo, Which DD are you referring to. The DD in floating equity from the highwater mark to present?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
yeah, this month drop 78%; i didn't follow your explorer all the way very closely, but it felt like a cut of a bunch of losing positions. btw, if it is due to agressive MM (increasing lotsize with margin growth), we might try to "square root" of the growth factor. for example, if the margin grows twice as original, don't raise the lotsize by 2, but by SQRT(2) = 1.414. just an idea, you may improvise yourself. this way might limit the risk of DD.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Your Stop (Gaps) seems to me in the meantime partially adapted/optimized? Well done! Do you use strictly MA22 trailing-stop for all open positions or only for new entries? Anyway, I watched, that there are still some former orders &gt; 200-300 pips in unrealized profit, which are not already protected by BE? E.g. GPB/USD did not already protected by Stop(Gap) at &gt; BE? Trade well my friend Over60

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Yes, I think going forward I'll be better off with the position sizing. That was much of the problem with the DD of equity. Of course if I hadn't had those large positions at the top, there wouldn't have been a large floating equity to draw down. I'm setting the MA trailing from the get go. I also place a 2x ADR s/l at the beginning. No BE.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
NzdJpy closed out on the trailing 22MA. Only JPY cross still open is the UsdJpy. I would not be suprised to see the Jpy's head back up as they're all still above the zero line (except GBP). But, we'll see.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
In one of Mark Douglas's seminars he says to maintain a smooth equity curve its best to scale out and trail stops as you do so. Says he tried to scale in but that lead to huge ups and downs in his equity but when he analyzed his trades he found very few actually went immediately against him so what he did was scale out at pre-detemined targets &amp; trail stops. Very few losers this way and a smooth equity curve in fact he advocates this. Just thought I'd pass on the info but problem with this approach is its not really ideal for trend following because the longer the trend persists the smaller your position size because of scaling out.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Big gap up on Jpy pairs today. Looks like Abe's choice for BOJ President may well spur the Yen to further lows. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-0...yodo-says.html

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Oh dear fellas, dead thread? I don't wish to gloat but when a man with 40 years of experience tries to help you it's probably better to listen to him rather than attacking him. Confucius didn't say it in quite those words but it sounds like good wisdom, or maybe just common sense, to me. After my last posts there were a lot of people asking me to give advice about trading. Well, I'm too old and tired to be bothered posting much on a forum where experience is not respected. Too many youngsters without a clue throwing their weight around. I will make a few general comments here though. The basic system in this thread will not work as it is because it is simply an always in ma cross system. Test it yourself. I accept that the thread starter was not following his own rules strictly anyway so the above point doesn't matter so much but it's worth mentioning. What happened was that you were lucky in catching a few good runs, particularly on yen pairs. This is because the yen was weak against all other currencies. The entry method itself is not too bad because you are trading when there is momentum in one direction. Better still though is to use two or even three ma's (50 sma and 100 sma works well) to identify which pairs are trending well, wait for a pullback to a fib level, strong s/r level and/or trend line and then trade at the sign of a hold. Use a stop based on ATR and trail behind the last 3 closed candles. Don't sit through pullbacks because half the time they become reversals. It's tempting to want to try and hit a home run with every trade but you will find it easier to just capture the momentum thrusts of each leg of a strong trend. To that end it is acceptable to take your profit when the momentum slows down. This usually means a reversal is coming so don't feel you have to wait until your stop is hit, bank profits while they are there if the momentum move you are trading loses momentum. There is a clue in the wording, it's all about momentum. Anyway, good luck all, I hope the above is useful.

Well done, Spidy I am a trend trader and have followed this thread with interest. This thread has allowed other traders to see the value of this style of trading, Spidy has always been happy for feedback on this thread. I congratulate him for attaching his account and being transparent. The big question was always how do you exit, i use atr trailing stop, but it is upto each individual trader to work that out according to their risk profile. Spidy, keep up the good work. nt

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Why not set up a trade explorer should be pretty easy for you with your 40 years of experience ... No?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Just wanted to say thanks, Spidy. Following this thread has been of real value for me. AG

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Well basically, we've gone through what I would call a cycle now on these trades. The Jpy pairs have all closed. I have some new ones going, but the markets, as you all know, have just been crazy the last couple of weeks. Looking back, as has already been noted, the position sizes at the top of those trends were killers. Going forward with the adjusted position size and s/l, I hope to see a smoother, albeit not as exciting, equity curve. I'll be out of town/country next week so won't be able to post, or trade much for that matter. I may have to close my positions and start up when I get back.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
well . as in the beginning this tread looks so impressive and the exist strategy may not be working for this thread . i used to find the target points by using fib fan.. simple calculation is 15 currencies and 150 pip in month 15*150= 2250 pip in month say 2% risk for 75 pips=60% in month we can .

--- 帖子 #463 ---
This is exactly the sort of post that dissuades me from even bothering with this forum. I have no need or desire to prove anything to anyone. I have been trading for a long, long time. What's more I have been making money doing it for a long time. At my age the desire to argue with some punk on the Internet is minimal. I wish everyone but particularly you good luck.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
That tells me exactly what I needed to know old man............. bye bye

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Ok, bye. The funniest thing is you think you're the winner.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Well, things haven't been too exciting lately. Markets look like they might be rolling over. The thread is slowing down, which it should. It wasn't intended to be an ongoing journal. As others read and ask questions I'll try and give my two cents. Or if I modify how I'm trading the system. I'll be sticking with and tweeking this for a long term approach as I trade other strategies as well. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Hi Spidey, You've done real well with your system. You knew you were going to give back some pips at some point, but to be honest, you could just as easy get a market turn and then hit the same kind of pips again. Good luck with it, I hope you continue to post as this is one of the few good threads here at FF I stop past to read and check progress. jt

--- 帖子 #468 ---
hi spidey, may i know how much capital u started with for this system? as im going to start it with usd200 and i afraid that it is not enough. btw i have done well in demo account with your system, it is really a good system

--- 帖子 #469 ---
hi spidey i like your system, great

--- 帖子 #470 ---
What is amazing is that there has been a run on the GBP-USD !!! Over 1,000 pips if taken at the start. I see you have some open trades but didn't catch the 7 cross 22 entry ??? Here is a chart, not strictly as yours, as I have SuperTrend Indicator there which is confirming, and a 240 LWMA also from another system, just work this into my charts to check long term - obviously I didn't look often enough. Why is it so easy to see after the fact? Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #471 ---
in the chart as you see .. i have a ques. is this a double top ?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Yes , this system is simple and great. I follow the system and short GBPUSD,so great! NOW the SL is above the EMA 22 .Let's see what will happen.Thanks for your good work. Best regards. Fishcoo

thx man .. i am new in forex and i lost over 600 $ and i dont know what indicators to use or best system .. i saw it .. and i am not sure .. can u explain me more .. what should i do ?thanks

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Spidey, It looks like you are starting to build some nice positions particularly in the short GBP based pairs. I notice that most of your recent positions are clustering about the 5PM close and early morning. I assume that his relates to the rest of your life. Any other reasons? AG

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi Spidey, thanks for your sharing. I really like this system because im working with a similar way. Based on slope direction line, daily charts. And trying to get trends with a few days, a week, who knows.. I would like to ask you, in an open operation, if you are getting profits at the 1st day and you see a little turn of the price (lets say you have +80 pips and then the market send you to get +50 pips in a few min and start to hit your stop moved by trailing/stop) What would you do? let it hit the stop and leave with +50 pips. Or just try to stay in the market (remember that we are trying to get trends of a few days..) the most you can? You leave with trailing stops or just when the trend changes? Thank you very much. Sorry for my bad english, is not my native language Regards, Kelvin.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Yes, that`s a double top.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hey all...back in the saddle after vacation. NJC. If you want to start trading with a small account you just have to use a broker that has micro lots. Oanda allows trading small amounts. I use Forex Broker Inc. and they allow trading down to $100 sizes, which at 500:1 would be 20 cents a trade of margin.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Yeah I've been waiting for confirmation on a lot of these, especially if they've been rangy which gbpusd had been since sept. I came in late but have 4 positions now for about 2000 pips.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Go to babypips.com and do lots of reading. And quit trading real money until you feel comfortable. That's the beauty of demo accounts.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
My daily bar closes at 5 EST, so I place all my new pendings at that time. Usually not immediate entries though, most of mine are based on buy/sell stops so the entry time is decided by the market movement.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Once I place my pending order and it triggers, I stay with the trailing stop. That's the way I'm playing it now. Now if I saw some major news event that might change the market sentiment then I might make an adjustment but that would be rare.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
@Spyderman, Saw, that you trade sometimes pairs/currencies with high swap/rollover rates, such as AUD and NZD. It´s not the issue here in your thread, but do you consider or combine such pairs in your basket in regard to Carrytrading? E.g. AUDCHF did perform well and why not trade similar currencies? Catching pips and swap rate. In the longterm run, especially with higher position sizes, the swap-rates can play a not underestimated part. Anyway and independent, such pairs can provide information about the cash flow, where commercials are invested by influencing the neutral major-pairs performance. FYI: Only a thought! For followers and newbies and for additional information concerning carrytrade-strategy please refer to: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=55679 Trade well my friends Over60

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Over60, Playing swap rates is definitely a strategy that some employ. I personally do not. Global interest rates are so low they come much less into play then they once did. As far as being more important with larger position sizes, I would disagree. They are still going to be a percentage of the position size, so yes, they may be a higher dollar amount, but so is the position size. They spread cost as well will increase with position size, but still only in comparison to the position size. I also wouldn't want the swap to become a limiting factor for entrance to a trade on a long term strategy. For example right now the GbpUsd is very favorable on swap, but it's turning out to be an excellent trade on PI. Lastly, swap rates vary greatly with brokers, so you'd have to factor that in as well. A broker that might be favorable for swaps might not do so well on spreads or other factors.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi Spyderman, Is this thread still active or is there a glitch with your trade explorer, looks like no open trades? Good work on this by the way - and having the cojones to attempt this in the first place.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
No glitch. I'm not going to be using this broker going forward so had to close all my positions. Interested in seeing the withdrawal process as well. As far as the strategy, I'm still going to employ going forward. I think it's a good long term strategy. There's not much more to say as far as the thread. I think everyone can get the sense of what's going on and mold it to their own trading tastes. Hopefully, it's given some ideas for people to benefit from.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Spyderman You sounded as to shut down your thread? If so sad again to see a good thread soon to become inactive. Well... it has been wonderful to follow your trading method, thou I am not 100% followed (a slower learner I think, also partly poor English understanding ) BTW what will be your new MT broker? Thanks

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Just a brief update. As the market doldrums of summer should be coming to an end, I am going to retest my PI strategy over the coming months. I'm not 'restarting' the thread as such, but may update once in a while if it goes well. Cheers.

Hello all. So here we are back again for another slice of "PI" I find myself returning to PI, not because it's some "Holy Grail" (it doesn't exit) of trading, or even because it's better then any number of trading systems discussed here on FF. I've returned to it because PI fits my style of trading and ultimately I think it will prove to be a successful long term strategy for me. It will not make you rich quickly, not even close. But if you stick with it, it can, over time grow your account nicely, just like many other trend following systems. I recently read the book "Following the Trend - Diversified Managed Futures Trading" by Andreas F. Clenow I had something of an Ah Ha moment reading his book and I would recommend it to anyone serious about trading. He proved statistically and empirically, that over time, even the most basic of trend following systems will and can compete and even out perform the major indices and popular hedge funds in terms of performance and account growth. It's not about the entries and exits. It's about diversification and money management. Diversification in Forex trading is somewhat difficult depending on the instrument offerings of your broker, and we won't go into detail on that here. Suffice to say that it is beneficial to your long term bottom line if you can vary your investments across asset classes, such as equities, commodities, currencies, rates, etc. Money Management is another story. With any trend following system the goal obviously is to get in early on a trend and take it for a long profitable ride. The problem is that we don't know when that will occur and no technical or fundamental analysis is going to be able to predict that. We just need to make sure we're there, ready and in place, when it happens. In order to do that we're going to suffer a lot of minor setbacks in the process. We need to be able to weather the perhaps many small losses so that we will still be in the game when the home run comes along. Also, to the degree possible, we want to minimize those small losses so that our accounts don't take too much of a hit while we're waiting. And that brings us to a couple of the problem areas that I personally had with the original PI system...and many other trend systems I've tried. ...to be continued...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
So if any of you have looked through the thread you will have noticed that we had a good measure of success in the early part of 2013. We had increases of 10's of thousands of pips and I increased the account size by a factor of 10 (in floating profit at least). Much of this was due to the yen sell off over that time period. After all, that's what trend trading is all about. One problem came as I stacked trades (I love stacking trades). I was adjusting the lot size of each subsequent stacked trade in line with the new floating equity. What that in effect did was drastically increase the lot sizing of positions as they were further along in the trend. However, as is typical with trend trading strategies, the positions toward the end of the trend are sacrificed at a loss as the Price Action turns and the direction of your trend changes. So these large position sizes, although relatively small in pip count, were eating up the profits from the earlier huge pip count positions that were of much smaller lot size. So...to remedy that error I am now basing the lot sizing on account balance and not equity. That way each position is exactly the same in terms of risk to the account balance. Additionally, I am lowering the risk % on each trade. In the past, I had a lot sizing of 3%. I want to now lower that to eventually be around .5 - 1%. I say eventually because...in order to get the spreads I want across as many pairs as possible I went to a ECN account which carries standard lot sizing. So 1 lot is 100,000 units. Smallest size I can trade is .01 lots or 1000 units. With the stop sizes typical with this strategy that equates to a higher risk based on my account size. More like 3-5%. I'm willing to take this risk now due to the smaller size of my account, knowing that I may blow it up. However, as my account size increases I will lower my risk % down to where I want it. The other main issue creating drawdown on the account were the many losing trades experienced while waiting to hit a trending pair. As discussed earlier, this to some extent just goes with the nature of trend trading. But if we could reduce these negative hits it would obviously be better for our equity growth, and less painful to our psyche. So to help accomplish that I have introduced some additional Higher Time Frame (HTF) filtering into the system. This will hopefully keep us out of some choppy markets while still allowing us to get into the longer term trends. ...more to come...

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I don't see how 'stacking' can work well in the US because of the Dodd/Frank forex reforms that insist on FIFO. I had a nice $/Y trade going so I added another trade but then the pair went sideways and the 2nd 'stacked' trade was in a small loss. I couldn't close it because of FIFO, I had to 1st close the very profitable trade and then the 2nd losing one. Good reason to go offshore I think.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Okay, So here's the new setup. First we look to the weekly chart to see what our long term trend is. Here's the NzdCad: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Which way are we trending...pretty obvious. The 7ema is above, in fact well above, the 22 ema. Wouldn't it have been nice to be in on this up trend since around September of 2013. We're up about 700 pips from those levels. Compare that to this chart of the AudJpy weekly: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We do not want to be trading in this type of price action. I want to wait and get some type of separation on the 7 above the 22 before going further. Take a look at the CadJpy: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's an example of a pair that has just recently (on the weekly time frame) come out of a congestion area and shown some separation of the 7 from 22. Will it continue down. We have no way of knowing of course, but for the moment it's looking like the start of a down trend and worth the risk. Now usually even though we have a nice trending pair on the weekly, that won't result in a smooth upward/downward move. Trends have pullbacks, and you can see those on the NzdCad with those bearish reversal bars. So next we go to the Daily...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
There are also US based brokers that handle FIFO in the back office. Not sure how they work it as I've not used them, but the way I understand it is that they handle your orders in accordance with the FIFO rules but on your platform it reacts as if you were closing the orders as you see fit. Same with hedging (which we don't use on this strategy.)

--- 帖子 #405 ---
So here we are on the Daily on the NzdCad: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The blue vertical line is the 7/22 cross on the weekly chart. We had a nice 2 month uptrend on the daily time frame before price congested. Then in January, a few days after the 7/22 cross up, we start to get some separation of the 7 and 22. This makes for a nice trading environment. The 7 is now well above the 22 on the weekly...and the daily... So we move to the hourly.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
So here's the hourly: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Again, the red vertical line is the 7/22 cross on the daily. I've zoomed way out so you can see the whole price action since that cross. Remember all the price action to the right of that red line is with the 7 above the 22 on the daily, so we'd be looking for trades on all the crosses. If you'd entered on each of the up crosses and moved them to BE, you'd currently have 5 positions open on this relatively short uptrend. That would have cost you about 3 entries hitting your stop loss for a .5% hit to your account on each. The rest would have closed out at BE. Not bad for already having locked in about 640 pips. Now zoomed in we see where I picked up the pair (already well along in the trend) and 3 entry areas based on the 1 hour. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I currently have 3 positions open on the NzdCad with 74 pips locked in on the first entry and the other 2 at BE. Next up is trade managment.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
good to read your posts. now you refer to the lower tf for entry?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I often take the initial entry on the 7/22 cross on the daily tf, but additional entries are on the hourly.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Previously I took stacked trades on continuation of daily trend based on candle reversals, etc. But now I'm taking additional entries based on the 7/22 cross on the hourly. A little on Trade Management: Again, optimal lot sizing for me will be approx. .5% per position My stops are at a recent swing (hourly) low/high or at obvious S/R levels. When price has moved in favor of trade equal to initial stop size I move to BE to protect against loss. As far as TP I look to close all trades in a series when the daily 7ema crosses back over the daily 22ema. That's basically it. I'll answer questions and post a trade from time to time, especially on an ongoing pair under discussion (i.e. NzdCad) But this isn't' meant to be a trade journal (although one is posted)

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi again Spyde, I´m here with you again. Let´s give this baby a new chance. As always, quiet threads drive my attention. And congratulations for your excellent start (113,6% in open trades..... ). Will start a small live account on Monday. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Good morning, Already recovered initial 5% closed loss........... Thank you Spyderman

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Good job. As with all trend following strategies, we just need patience. Markets are a bit choppy right now. The big trenders are trying to decide which way to go. BOJ comments are causing indecision in the yen pairs. Canada's up one day, down the next. Kiwi pairs are all over the place. Patience.....

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Yes, we can only be in the market waiting for a trend to establish, let it run when we are right and cut quickly when we are wrong.... Cheers

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi If you can post charts, then it will be great for beginners like me to understand more of your trading method / style? Thanks

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I think the charts on the last couple of pages spell everything out pretty well. Again this isn't a trade journal. If anyone has a specific question on something, I'll attempt to answer it.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I do like this system for it's simplicity. I believe you can replace the MAs and MACD with the Heikin ashi, everything else remaining same.
