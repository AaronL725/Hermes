i'm starting this thread to explore the ICWR Trading System. It stands for Impulsive/Corrective Wave Retracement. I started playing with this strategy last week and have had my best week so far! i am attaching a pdf explaining the strategy. The main idea is having the confidence to stay in the trade for the maximum pips. i am also working on an EA for autotrading this system. see the EURUSD chart to see 2 entries. i am setting up a "Standard" trade which would've happened where you see the BLUE line, and a "DARE ME" trade which would've happened where you see the RED line. Both would've been winners....123 (Dare Me) and 106(Standard) pips. i hope there will be some interest in this topic. i will probably upload the autotrader tomorrow, but here is some info to get started. i'm also uploading the indicator that works with the system(not created by me). there are a few out there, but this one works pretty well. it draws the fibo automatically for you. i have been using the H1 charts and like that pretty well so far. Standard Trade requirements - the 7MA &gt; 21MA - the 21MA &gt; 49MA - the STOCH (21,14,14) - the Main line &gt; Signal line - RSI(14) &gt; 50 Dare Me Trade requirements - the STOCH (21,14,14) - the Main line is&gt; Signal line - RSI(14) &gt; 50 i'm always open to suggestions...... **************************Version 2 update uploaded 9/11******************************* hey guys, i have uploaded version 2 of my EA. you will notice 5 new buttons....CL-25 thru CL-75 and NO SL button. after you open a trade(with or without a SL set), you can press any of the 4 CL buttons and the SL will automatically be moved to that level. you can press another level and it will be moved to that level for you. IF YOU KEEP one of the CL buttons on (maroon), the SL will automatically move if that fib level moves during the trade. IF YOU want the SL to remain wherever you have it at the moment, click NO SL to TURN off the AUTOMATIC SL MOVEMENT. so, as your trade moves in your direction(we hope) and the fib enlarges...moving the fib levels, you can automatically place the SL and it will move accordingly. **************************Version 3 update uploaded 9/15******************************* i added BOF and BOP buttons for placing pending trades based on the fib 0% and 100% levels (BOF) and pending trades based on the current price(BOP). please refer to post # 108 for a better description. **************************Version 3.1 update uploaded 9/22******************************* i have changed the time frame for the Standard and Dare Me buttons to be on the timeframe of your chart. i have not tried it out yet! i also added the pair name and the spread for the pair....color coded green or red depending on what your variable for Spread_Max is. i have it set for 3. so if the spread is &gt;=3, the square will be red for warning. if less than 3, green for ok. just sort of a visual...... maybe when i get the autotrading going, i will incorporate that to be a factor in taking a trade or not. **************************Version 3.5 update uploaded 9/28******************************* i have added 2 buttons for AUTOTRADING this EA. see post # 123 for more info on 2 new buttons i set up for Autotrading so we wont have to babysit all day!!!! PLEASE use this in a demo account until you verify it works for you!!!!!!

How is the profitability percentage of the EA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #3 ---
i dont know yet. i'm just coding the EA. but using the strategy, this was my week since yesterday.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hey pipsqueen18, great work. can see you have added some additional signals for confirmation which is good. looking forward to see what you come up with. I'm certain we can take this strategy forward together.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
From the image you've attached, I can see that you've entered the trade on an active wave. Was this part of your strategy?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Would it be possible to have template please Do we need PSAR on template? I have the M5 &amp; H4 set up but I wanted to make sure I have it correct. Thank you

--- 帖子 #7 ---
i hope so. i dont have that much experience so i'm happy for all help, thoughts, suggestions, etc......

--- 帖子 #8 ---
yes, one of my problems has always been to be patient and wait for the pullback! this has helped me with increasing the percentage of a continuation or not.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
hey mtpockets, the psar is not really valid for this strategy. i just still have them on my chart from my previous template. here are some of the indies i use. the only one you need for sure is the icwr_a or i made a few changes to it and called it ICWR_mrd. all i did was add the percentages to the levels and tried to change the color to red or green if buying or selling, but it doesnt always work (the color change). something i have noticed about the original ICWR_a (and mine ICWR_mrd) is that it has the RequiredWaveHeight set for 40 default. this is fine. but say you are on a long run, and it starts to regress, and the regression is &gt;40, the fib flips even though it has not reached the 38, 61 or specifically the 75 (the exit level per the strategy). so i have been placing a line manually so i can keep track of that level. anyway....just check it out and see if you see what i mean. i'm not smart enough to edit that indie (and am not even sure if is should be changed)! anyway, just watch out for it and we can discuss it maybe? also, PERSONALLY, i'm not sure i like that the strategy calls for a pullback all the way to the 75 level, but, again, i have only been using the strategy for about 1 week. i'm looking forward to thoughts and suggestions from people smarter than me! lets fill ALL our pockets!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
With what lot size is that? if 0.01, then I am happy to let you know to continue!... Congrats and Good Luck, I'll be following this and contributing Have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
i usually do .03 to .07 but arent pips the main thing? everybody uses different lots, but pips are pips. i feel like the mother of pips since last week! lol!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I personally look it at it a different way but everyone has their preference! For ex. If I can make a great daily profit with the minimum lot size which is 0.01 with a good degree of accuracy and low drawdown, then I scale that up.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
i agree totally with you. i'm trying to get to a consistent amount of pips/trade, then i will increase lot size too! i will eventually set up my EA with the option of 2 trades/ click.....1 for long run &amp; 1 for high lot for less pips. i guess a combo of long term/scalping. but again, if i am closing positive pips with the strategy, it is proof it works and people can use the EA how they want. if the EA works well enough, i will probably set up something similar to my dash on other thread(the hare and the tortoise) to watch more pairs in one chart. anyway...this is down the road. the evolution should be interesting, but hopefully profitable for all!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
check out these DARE Me and Standard entries on nzdcad! too bad i didnt get in from the beginning! its been in a free fall for 2 days. it looks like it has not even regressed to the 25% line either, much less 75%!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
can you upload the dtrend_4 indicator please? The setup ist very old from i think 2005 but your twist makes sense to me. even if the rsi is not helpfull for imo. Is the box with the a fib trade levels part of your ea or could you open the indi for this?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
hey arlucad, here's the indie you asked for. why do you think the rsi is not helpful? can you give more info? yes, the box with the fib levels is what i am working on. i'm not ready to upload yet...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi pipqueen18 Got your template all set up ... looks real busy on right side of template .. could this be an alternative to the fib lines currently on the right side? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just curious Forgot to add this. It might need the code upgraded (I don't know a thing about script. I fumbled around with Compiling it but I don't know what I'm doing) Attached File(s) icwr.mq4 39 KB | 866 downloads

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hi MT, i have added some stuff to the template i posted, but you can bring in the indie by itself and add to it as you wish. it looks like this on a regular chart. your indie looks interesting too! it would solve the problem of the fib switching when you think it should not switch as i talked about earlier in post 9. but i am trying to tie in the EA into trading on the fib levels....either to open another trade on the bounce or to set up an exit like the strategy suggests. p.s. the indie i "edited" ICWR_mrd, has the levels numbered. so everybody can pick their fav....

--- 帖子 #19 ---
mtpocket's icwr would not work on my mt4, so i made a few changes to get it to open. this is what it looks like on my mt4...in case anybody else is having trouble too.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi pipqueen where we can get this EA?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
hi ordosgoitia, i am still working on my EA. i may be able to upload today or tomorrow. i;m waiting for market to open to check it some more. mtpockets found an old thread but i have NOT tried out the EA on this thread. if somebody wants to check it out, please let us know your opinion! here is the link. ttps://www.mql5.com/en/forum/172983/page3

--- 帖子 #22 ---
hey pipqueen interesting thread - but one quetion, you said it's your best week so far yet your open drawdown looks relatively very large do you anticipate this clearing?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
yes. i was only talking about closed orders....+ pips. i was anticipating those going positive also.... left over orders from bad habits! i actually made a HUGE mistake last week while working on my EA and it closed ALL my trades. costly mistake, but oh well, we are not supposed to be using money we cant lose, right? that's what i get for coding in my real account instead of my demo account! rookie coder mistake!!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
hey pipqueen yes good idea not to code on your live account! by 'left over orders from bad habits' do you mean some of the negative trades are from another system on the same account? blam

--- 帖子 #25 ---
yes, that is what i mean. i just started using this strategy about 1 week ago.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
i'm updating the indicator i posted earlier. i left an obnoxious Alert i had in there for some testing. this one gets rid of the alert.

First trade taken with iwe_ea_v10_1 NZDUSD 5 min chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let's see if it works

--- 帖子 #28 ---
hi mt, it looks like you sold this. shouldnt it have been long? did you do this manually? or with an EA? imo, i think it should've been a buy. any other opinions?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I let the EA take the trade .. stopped out at 10 pips

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I think so, cause price is in the buy zone

--- 帖子 #31 ---
ok sorry. i'll just watch cuz i'm not using that exact indie!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
here is the first version of my EA. WARNING!!!!! i am a novice coder!!!! PLEASE use a demo account!! this ea will open 2 types of trades. Standard button - for a BUY - the 7 MA &gt; 21 MA - the 21 ma &gt; 49 MA - the Stocashtic Main Line is &gt; Signal Line - RSI &gt; 50 for a sell, the opposite of above. DARE Me button - for a BUY - the Stocastic Main Line is &gt; Signal Line - the RSI &gt; 50 for a sell, the opposite of above. you need to also put the indicator below in indicator folder so it can read the values of the fibs. this is set up for the 1hour TF. i have not gotten to the SL and TP working yet. i'm looking forward to input from you guys!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This fool had the EA on the wrong TF .. should have been 1 hour. Good lesson to learn ... DON'T EVER BE IN A RUSH !!!!!!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Nice!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Good morning everybody, i've got the SL and TP working okay now. is anybody trying this out?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Yes, put Your latest EA on EU, 1 ouhr chart. Have indicator from post 32 in my indicatorfolder. Default EA settings. SL=TP=0 Does trade newer stop or does it stop with loss/profit under strategi circumstances? Best wishes

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Something is wrong, no trades Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Got the same picture on AUDJPY,H1 - don't now why.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hey guys, sorry if it is not working for you. i'm on mt4, Build 1090. the EA from post 37 took a trade for me this morning on eurusd. did you click one of the auto trade buttons.....standard or dare me? one of those has to be clicked. the indie....ICWR_mrd is only the indie necessary for the EA. you must use ICWR_EA_v1.0 for auto trading.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I'm also on MT4, Build 1090. I pushed both bottoms. Stop and TakeProfit was correct but this error message above (ICWR_mrd ...)?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
do you have the indicator ICWR_mrd.ex4 in your indicator folder?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Yes I have it in my folder.....when i push "standard" it opens a buy trade immiediately. But the errors message from post 37 are still there

--- 帖子 #43 ---
well if it opened a but trade immediately, the conditions must've been met to open the trade immediately. i'm not sure about the errors. can anybody smarter than me help out? sorry dude.....

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Do You have same errors as I under expert tab?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Got the same error ...

--- 帖子 #46 ---
sorry no error messages on my end.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Justed started pairs on Demo, immediately opened them on "standard".

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Strange ...Wich version of the indi are you using?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i'm using these maybe it is broker differences? i have seen on other threads where this is an issue?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
It must be something wrong? Have tested the earlier version, and that worked ...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
earlier version of ea or indie?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Indi...

--- 帖子 #53 ---
My test is with XM ....whats Your brooker....I can test with the same brooker as You have

--- 帖子 #54 ---
i use oanda

--- 帖子 #55 ---
who do you ask? Me? If so, my broker is Global Prime.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
i have not messed with the indie in days! only the ea

--- 帖子 #57 ---
you too, bazze, which broker do you use?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I will test with oanda, bazze You have same wrong as I have with XM, I will download Oanda and test with demo

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Opened Oanda demo, click on standard, immidately opens a trade, same wrong under expert tab, strange Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
just ckicked Standard now on Oanda, eurusd, 1H. its not ready to open trade since the RSI is &lt; 50, while the main stochastic is above signal line. the MA's are in line for a buy. so no trade right now. you should get the text saying Waiting for Standard Trade. if the RSI goes above 50, it should enter the trade....although probably not a very good one right now! the EA just opened a buy for me.....took about 5 minutes.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Maybee its because my indicator is "not initialized and array out of range"? The only indicator I have put in my indicator folder is ICWR_mrd, no indicator on charge

--- 帖子 #62 ---
have you drug it onto a chart yet? maybe that is why?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
cant drag it onto a chart, when I try it dissapears, not stay on my chart

--- 帖子 #64 ---
all i can say is try to compile this file and put it in your indicator folder and try to drag it in. to Elovv, i have added the indie and EA to a 2nd computer with mt4 and had NO problems. i hope you got it figured out!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
the EA just put me into NZDCHF about 10 minutes ago with a Dare trade. up 3.4 pips 12 pips

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Which of the indicators draws and shows the fib levels on MT4 chart? I have the ICWR_mrd indicator and the ICWR_EA_v1.0.ex4 indicator. I have the lines drawn on my MT4, but the fib levels don't appear such as 0.00% , 25%, 38%, 75%...etc. Which indicator will draw and at the same time display these labels?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
hi tptrillion, it is the indie posted in post 64. it should work! if not, try adding the template i posted on sept 1....

--- 帖子 #68 ---
today, eurusd hit a hi and raised the fib 0 level, regressed to the 75% level (did NOT have a full candle below), went back up and regressed to the 61% level. went back up and regressed to the 38% level and headed back up. will it push up the top of the fib???? rsi = 58 stoch = 64 and 3 ma's all aligned 7 hours later...up 22 pips 29 pips 0 fib moving up

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi pipqueen, Decided to follow this thread...though it makes my work on trailing stops obsolete for the EA, I can still use most of the guts of the Hare and Tortoise EA that I modified. could you upload the latest .mq4 version of the EA and Indi you are using. I am thinking that I will make it autotrade all the pairs, which will give us a better set of results and help find out the returns once we take in a few losing trades. I will keep your Dare Me and Standard ideas, but for the purpose of analysis I will keep them in 2 separate EA's on 2 different accounts, which will trade at the same time for a true comparison, to find the best method. Also in the pdf is mentions that they use a 5min time frame with a 4 hour filter. Why are you using the EA on a 1 hour chart?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
AUDUSD H1 short trade taken by ICWR_EA_v1.0 Dare Me of pipqueen18 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think I should have waited and gone for a Standard entry

--- 帖子 #71 ---
great news, theone! i would love to see the comparison of the standard trade vs dare me trade. eventually i would like to have 1 chart with 10 or 15 or 28 of these ea's on it, but i was working out the first one first. we can work in tandem and see which one ends up better! as far as the entry, i sort of am doing my own thing. i do not like doing anything on the 5 minute, but that is just me. i guess i use my own entry and use the icwr for exit, or at least for whether to stay in a trade or get out. the posted ea and indie are still valid. you can see that mtpockets is using a different ea with the rectangles, which he has already posted too. i'll pm you later. gotta run!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I scraped out the Dash I had created earlier to make it applicable to this strategy. I have the RSI, SL Autotrade, Time filter, Money Mangement set up (got rid of the currency baskets, trailing stop, take profits). Since I am novice I need the mq4 for the EA so I can see how you are reading the data from the indie and basicly apply it to 28 pairs in tandem.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
no worries. not sure if this has any functions BESIDES the standard and dare me trades. if it does, that is not working properly yet!!!! this EA ONLY has the standard and Dare Me buttons working right now!!! still a work in progress! here are a few of my thoughts to add to it.... - The CL-75, CL-61, etc buttons will be used to SET and MOVE the SL as the price moves in our favor. So if the CL-25 button is “ON”, a SL will be moved to or created and placed at the 25 fib level. If user leaves the button “ON”, and the price moves in our favor, the SL also moves. So basically a trailing stop of sorts. If the button is turned “OFF”, the SL will stay at that level and not move along with the price. (yes, this goes against the icwr strategy, but up to user preference how to trade!) personally, I would hate to lose 75% of gained pips!! Again, just me. - NO SL will remove the SL from the order - I was also thinking of a “+” button along side each CL-75, CL-61, etc, that when one of those is turned “ON”, and the price regresses to that level, another order is placed for you, to add to your position. - I also am going to add the name of the pair which will also be a button to open that chart - Also add the spread for each pair. And I also am going to “darken” the color of the form if the spread is higher than some number chosen by the user. In other words, a warning that the spread for the pair is above your comfort zone. The form will still work, but it will be a visual that the spread is higher than you like. Again, these are just thoughts. What do you guys think? any opinions?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I think there is a very serious issue with the indicator. I mean it works but it is doing something against the rules. It is setting the fib levels to the current line which may or may not be an active wave (40 pips for 5M and 150pips for 4H). The problem I found is in the code. If you change the setting in the indicator of the RequiredHeight is does absolutely nothing because it is referenced in the code as a fixed variable. The issue is that it is being set to either 40 or 150 POINTS not PIPS. I have uploaded a fixed version and it also has been changed to we variable dependent. I added a field to specify in PIPS the Minimum Wave Height for each period.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Excellent!! i have only been using it in the 1H so i was not aware of this! thanks!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
good day yesterday and even better morning today! anybody else doing good?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello, good to hear that, I just started 4H yesterday evening, I'll post how it goes.(TP 150pip and SL 100 will be ok?)

--- 帖子 #78 ---
glad to hear you are trying this out. as far as your sl/tp....according to the system, you should not get out unless you get a full candle below 75% fib. personally, it is hard for me to lose any profit i have gotten. i have been in a few eur trades lately and they have not regressed that far. i think my plan will be to have 1 trade in for the long haul and get in with some shorter trades when regression happens. i did that yesterday with pretty good results. so to answer your question....this is all personal and what works best for you and your comfort level. good pips to all!!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hello, I'm using only the EA, standard ones. Do you use all the other indies and start manual trading too? Will you go on live account?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
since it is a work in progress, i guess i am using a combination of the ea and manual right now. my thought is to use the standard or dare me buttons for the initial entry. then, i am coding "Aux" buttons for each fib level which will be able to be used if the user wants to enter an auxiliary(secondary) trade when price regresses (for either just another position or for a possible scalp). it will all be optional and configurable for user preference. anyway, that is the plan for now. i am using it on my live account now.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
i'm pretty excited about my day today!! anybody else have a good day?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Looks good ! So, could you plz summerize/actualize the indis + EA working now for you (plus others here) bugfree . Best to post them fresh in the first post of your thread - as usual. Perhaps I'll jump in.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I don't trade this pair normally, but it just looked to good to pass up.. USDCNH Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Very Nice!!!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi, this EA open automatically order and close this order automatically? Or we must close this order mannually ?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Can you share the set file. I demo trade CJ and it triggered buy and later went on the opposite direction. Do you set SL? Thanks

--- 帖子 #87 ---
No, my ICWR day is so far bad, but see how it ends (4H based). The other one from this week was ok, on 5min base.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
hi kenny, the ONLY properties i would recommend you play with are the SL/TP. i have NOT changed any of the other properties. they control the fib. i have not really used TP or SL personally since the main point of the strategy is to not cut your profits early. and on the pairs i am watching this week, the regression has not passed the 61 fib! mostly none of them have even passed the 38 fib! i have been mainly in a few of the EUR pairs. right now, as far as the EA, the ONLY working buttons are the STANDARD and DARE me buttons. i am working on the others. also, before i turn on the EA, i look at the weekly and get the overall direction since i try not to trade against the overall direction. i also look and see if i think the pair has room to get to another level on the weekly. i hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
i have only been using the 1H! i personally dont like using the 5 min for entries. to much noise for me.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
i had an amazing evening and this has been my best 2 weeks. i feel like i have turned a corner in my trading! happy pips to all!!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
so far the EA only opens the 2 types of trades for you. you can set your SL/TP before if you wish, but they are set for 0 initially.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
@pipqueen18 , is there a Need for VPS doin this syst. ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Ok but when I put this EA on the chart, I click on dare me, then I launch this EA on the vps. This EA close the position automatically when a change of trend is detected by ea and next, a new trade will be launched? Sorry for my bad English, i'm French

--- 帖子 #97 ---
hi aaxandre9, IF you set the SL or TP in the properties window, and you press either Dare me or Standard buttons, the EA will place the trade when the conditions are met as discussed in post 1. you will then have to press the Dare me Or standard button to enable auto trading again. in other words, it only places 1 trade. i am working on more options. hope to upload version 2 soon! many pips to all this week!!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
What do you think about adding an option on the EA that allows it to add and build positions?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
hey ch33se, yes, i was thinking about doing that as price regresses to 25, 38 or 61 fib level.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hey guys, i have uploaded version 2 of my EA. you will notice 5 new buttons....CL-25 thru CL-75 and NO SL button. after you open a trade(with or without a SL set), you can press any of the 4 CL buttons and the SL will automatically be moved to that level. you can press another level and it will be moved to that level for you. IF YOU KEEP one of the CL buttons on (maroon), the SL will automatically move if that fib level moves during the trade. IF YOU want the SL to remain wherever you have it at the moment, click NO SL to TURN off the AUTOMATIC SL MOVEMENT. so, as your trade moves in your direction(we hope) and the fib enlarges...moving the fib levels, you can automatically place the SL and it will move accordingly. good luck!!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks bro, will try it.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
anybody else enjoying this "trailing stop" at the Fib Level of your choice? it is working out pretty well!!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi pipqueen18 nice work. I love how this ea work. Can I know what kind pair can use this ea ? Can I use 28 pair for this ea?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
thanks nas92! yes, it should work on any chart you put it on. i only do forex so have not tried on gold and other stuff.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
hi pips Queen how have your trades done this week ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #106 ---
hi paul, in all honesty, i have not "turned" on any auto trades this week. i have mostly been in my practice account working on my coding. i am currently shorting eurusd and am up 36 pips and am shorting gbpcad and am up 25 pips in that one. i got into those manually, but used the conditions of a Dare me trade before entering. i'm using the 25% fib level as a "trailing stop". has not been hit yet! how about you? any good pips?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
i'm posting my ea again. i just cleaned up some code. you will see no user changes except in the Expert Tab.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
i added 2 new buttons i think are pretty cool! BOF and BOP. they stand for Break Out Fib and Break Out Price. BOF will set 2 pending orders (a sell buy and sell stop) at the 0% and 100% levels of the fib. you can add a distance from the fib levels by putting a value in the BO_Diff input in the property window. so you can add 5 pips or 10 pips or whatever to the fib 0 and 100 values. BOP works the same way except it uses the current price as the point of placement. the value of BO_Price_Diff in the property window is already set for 10. you cannot use 0 for this value. it has to have a value in it or the pending orders wont be placed. my thought is that if a pair is in a channel, measure the height of the channel and divide the pips by 2. you would want to use this number (or slightly higher) in the BO_Price_Diff. so when a pair is consolidating, this will be pretty cool. you can set Lots, SL and TP for these trades using the BO_Lots, BO_S_Loss and BO_T_Profit inputs. PS. the NA and "+" buttons are not programmed yet!!!!!!! they dont do anything at this point!!!!! the pic below shows 2 pending trades using the BOF button, with 0 for the BO_Diff, BO_S_Loss of 20 and BO_T_Profit of 40. PLEASE use this in a demo account until you verify it works for you!!!!!!! PPS. this exact time and pair in the pic would probably NOT be the best time to use the FOB or FOP since the pair looks like it is going up. i only used this chart for the picture clarity!!

here is example of the BOP button. the pair is in a small channel for the last 6 hours (about 45 pips). BO_Price_Diff = 25 BO_S_Loss = 10 BO_T_Profit = 0 i probably could've used slightly larger BO_Price_Diff..... to encompass the bear candle 6 hours ago......up to you!! p.s i had a small glitch with the Sell Stop. please download version 3 again! sorry.....

hey guys, sorry i've been mia this week. i've been working OT and leaving town tomorrow. but i wanted to post, AND ENCOURAGE, somebody that pm'ed me. he said he was doing good using the DARE Me button. i hope he posts and tells us how he is using it! i also encourage anybody to post their results and share with everybody! Good and Bad!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I decided to give this a try, to see if it has potential. I put the EA on M15 charts, with 12 pairs(TP=5, SL=10). All trades are standard trades. So far, it's looking pretty good. I may tighten up the SL to 5, so R/R=1:1. The only downside, especially on lower TFs, is that you have to babysit the trades, since they don't last long. For me, the idea is to keep the trades rolling, so I start a new one for every one that has closed.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
hey rob, that's GREAT!!!! i'm glad it is working for you! i can add a button to "turn on" the Dare me or Standard button again after the original trade is closed. that way you wont have to babysit it all the time! also, since your SL only got hit twice out of 12 trades, it seems to me that might be a good SL. maybe make your TP 10? just a thought.... great job and thanks for posting!!! another thing.....you are using the 15 min chart, but the requirements getting in a trade are all based on the 1H tp . i will change it so the time frame for the trades is based on the chart you are using, if you want.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
That would be great if you could program it to auto-trade and also provide inputs for different TFs.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
pipqueen18 can you show me your entries with icwr ? On which lvl we entry and sl and out ? Did we waiting for candle close ? I am reading and reading and be confused. I want for start test this manualy thank you for your work !

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi pipqueen, Thanks for sharing the trading system. How can I download the fibo level indicator? Is it possible for you to put your tpl for share?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
hi nptrader, i got most of my information from chapter 3 of the pdf, but did not really like entering on the 5 min. tf, so i am mostly using the "Dare Me" trade requirements for entering, as posted in the 1st post. good luck!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
hi kasrafx, all files can be found by clicking the "paper clip" at the top of post #1.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
So, we entry when candly close above confirmation level which is 0.75 or 0.25 we can entry when other rules are good (rsi,ma's). Am I undestrand this? hmm ,I am thinking now about sl and tp. How about DTrend ,are you looking for everyone arrow must be the same?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
as i understand the strategy, you are supposed to CLOSE your trade when you get a full candle below (uptrend trade) the 75% retracement. i have "modified" the strategy for my own personal entries using either the Standard requirements or Dare me requirements. as far as the Dtrend and Probabilty meter, i just happen to like those indies. but do not really have input in the ICWR strategy. again, this is all personal preference, right?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi PipQueen, Nice work you have going in here. This strategy has generated some nice pips for me but upon testing and reading the manual, I realise that the EA does not follow the rules. From my understanding here are the rules: Conditions for a Trade Signal to be Generated 1) Fib ratios are drawn on the active wave 2) An active wave is the price swing closest to where price presently is 3) For an active wave to be valid: (i) It must have a length of 40 pips for intraday (e.g 5mins TF) or (ii) It must have a length of 150 pips for long term TF 4) Price must retrace into the retracement channel (0.382-0.618) 5) Watch for first whole candle outside Confirmation line, that is: (i) For Bull trades: 0.75 (ii) For Bear trades:0.25 5a) Not that the whole candles being outside the confirmation line means that the Low, Open, Close and High of the confirming candle must occur outside the confirmation line. 6) Check that the RSI is the time frame you are trading on is 50/50. That is 50 for Bull and for bear, it should be 50 7) When the above conditions from (1) to (6) are met, enter trade 8) Stop Loss should be set on the opposite confirmation line, that is (i) For Bull: 0.25 (ii) For Bear: 0.75 Please can you confirm if these are the EXACT RULES you used to code the EA

--- 帖子 #121 ---
hi eiseprod, if i am reading your post correctly, it sounds like you are wondering if my EA enters trades when price retraces to the 75% level. the answer is NO. i have programmed it to enter: for standard BUY, 7 MA &gt;14 MA, 14 MA &gt; 49 MA, Stoch main line &gt; Signal line and RSI &gt; 50. The opposite is true for a standard SELL. for Dare Me BUY, Stoch main line &gt; Signal line and RSI &gt; 50. no MA's involved. if i read the pdf correctly, (and i admit i only read up to chapter 3) the regressing to the 75% line was to determine if you should stay in a trade or get out. i personally dont like giving up so many pips (regressing to the 75%) so i did not code in an exit. i think everybody can set their own according to how they like to trade. if the pair is really trending, the 25% button is pretty cool, but if it is not trending, chicagorob's way seemed to be working out pretty well for him in which he is setting SL's and TP's. i am leaning his direction since you can set a TP and increase your lot size to hit your daily number as you gain confidence with the (modified) strategy.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
hey guys i have changed the time frame for the Standard and Dare Me buttons to be on the timeframe of your chart. i have not tried it out yet! i also added the pair name and the spread for the pair....color coded green or red depending on what your variable for Spread_Max is. i have it set for 3. so if the spread is &gt;=3, the square will be red for warning. if less than 3, green for ok. just sort of a visual...... maybe when i get the autotrading going, i will incorporate that to be a factor in taking a trade or not. let me know if there are any problems. again, this will use the same requirements, but ON THE TIME FRAME of your CHART!! happy pips!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
hey guys, sorry this has taken me a couple of weeks, but i have not had much spare time. anyway.... i have updated my EA to work on the TF you are on, and not be hard coded to 1 hour as it was before. also, i have integrated 2 AUTOTRADING buttons.....one for standard trades and one for the dare trades. so the individual STandard and Dare Me buttons work as before.....they are stand alone for taking a single trade. the 2 AT buttons next to each one turns on AUTOMATIC TRADING for each type of trade. pressing the AT button will automatically turn on the corresponding button. to turn it off, press it again. it is not fully tested. i will be leaving mine on over night on a few charts. SORRY!!! if you downloaded this already, please download again. i had to fix something!!!! happy pips!!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
i've got the EA running on 5 pairs with a SL of 20 and TP of 10. plus pips on 1 pair so far. i'll report how it goes overnight! it has opened 4 trades so far. i also have only turned on the DARE Me Autotrading button! later!!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hey there pipqueen, As I understood you have inspired from ICWR strategy and created this system but I see no similarities between them apart from using fibo levels. The fibo is drawing the last wave, where as ICWR active wave definition is totaly different. I think if you can code your fibo as it is described in ICWR the results would be lot better. Further more you set fix SL and TP's on different pairs. The volitilty USDJPY is not the same as EURCAD so I guess that should be adjusted (from the above picture) pluse 2:1 RR is not quite a good money manageement I must say, may be that should be fixed too. Okay too much criticism. I am thinking of a way to optimise your idea and I hope I will come up with something more efficient but that may need to add or change indicators you are using.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
hi kxeroo, you are correct on many levels! first, yes my RR ratio is whack! my results overnight proved that! my trades hit 3 TP, and lost most of it on the one SL that got hit! i guess it was late when i set that up last night! 2. i did not make the indie, only the EA and the indie does not work exactly like i would like it. i am going to try to modify that today...IF I CAN!! i am thinking about creating the MAIN fib, but when retracement starts, create 2 secondary fib for the retracement and NOT get rid of the 1st fib until the price knocks out the first fib. again, i'm planning on trying it. i;m not sure i am that good at figuring it out!! 3. yes, i am not following the strategy totally. just trying to figure out how to make $$. any help would be appreciated!!!! i am open to suggestions!! 4. i'm hoping others will have better success and share with us!

--- 帖子 #127 ---
so overnite, i hit 3 TP's hit 1 SL did not set up 1 pair correctly with TP and SL still waiting for my Standard trade to kick in. should be soon and now waiting to see if EA works correctly by entering second trade after TP/SL getting hit! 6:54 am..... looks like the ea is working ok. it just got me into EURCAD with trade #2. cool!! 7:30 AM........ok this just totally bogged down my system when we got those price fluctuations a minute ago! so i need to refine my EA. sorry guys!!!! so if you put it on too many charts....be careful! again....sorry!!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I currently have the EA on H4. I noticed several closed trades on just one bar. Is this the EA closing and opening trades in succession? No problem with resources here - task manager is showing only 2% CPU usage on a standard i5 4590 machine, with 8GB ram.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
i have not programmed anything to close a trade. a trade should only close with a SL or TP set by user. but IF you have one of the SL buttons set, that might be doing it if the level is hit. i noticed that the SL button stays "engaged" after a trade is closed. so you have to make sure it is OFF if you dont want it on. i had trades close unexpectedly cuz it was still "ON". about your cpu usage....great news. must be my piece of crap system! lol! i hope you post how your trades are doing/have done!!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I just checked the trade history and found that TP was hit several times on one bar - must have been news that caused the big move.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hey guys, i hope everybody had a nice weekend...... i had somebody send me a link to this fibonnaci indicator and it is pretty cool!! the pic attached has ALL the options turned on!!! you have total control over which fib type you like to use. check it out!!!! i am going to try to bring in this data into my ea, if i can.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
over the weekend, i changed the Autotrading requirements on this dash i had been using a few months ago. the requirements now match the auto trading buttons i had on my original EA. you will notice 2 columns of AutoTrade buttons.....Dare and Stand(ard). they work the same as my ea, except you can see all the pairs now. you will also notice the Yellow squares below.....Dare Me trades and Standard trades. use these boxes to set your lots, TP and SL's for the corresponding autotrade you want to turn on. clicking the AT button for the pair and type of autotrading you want to do will turn the AT button marroon. this means it is on. click it again (white color) and the Autotrading feature is OFF!! i turned it on last night using the Standard button on AUDUSD with a SL of 10 and TP of 20. my TP target was hit and it automatically put me in a 2nd trade which is currently up 6 pips. i will post more about the dash later, if anybody is interested. IF YOU LOAD THIS for the first time.....it will probably take about 10 minutes the first time. so put it on a black background and go get a cup of coffee!! btw, if you are expecting a autotrade to take place and it is not happening, check your Journal tab. it will tell you if trades are trying to be made and what is probably wrong is that your SL or TP are too small for that pair.....like any jpy pairs. i might have a small glitch with the jpy pairs so dont set a SL and Tp for now. i dont have time to fix it right now!! sorry!!!!!! happy pips to all this week!!

--- 帖子 #133 ---
i ran across an old thread about fibonnaci's from 2007! very old. i downloaded the template and added the daily, intermediate and swing fibs as described in the thread and pdf you can download also. the intraday fib is automatic if you put his indie on...also in the thread. this is what my chart looks like...... in case anybody is interested..... there are also a few videos. i saw a couple of them. the indie he provides automatically puts in 2 high targets and 2 low targets....pretty cool i also did not know that you can edit the fib you put on your chart! you can add new levels, name them, add the price and of course change the colors and thickness of lines. i added the pink horiz lines representing the zone of Intraday Long and Intraday Short levels https://www.forexfactory.com/printth...?t=50767&amp;pp=40

Test Results: Tested the Dashboard yestersay. At about 20.45pm (UK Time, that is GMT+1), I turned on Auto Trading for all the pairs in the Dashboard, using the "Standard" option and left it overnight. Today, Friday the 6th of October, which happens to be a non farm payroll day, I turned off all the pairs at about 19.00, the attached screenshots are my results. £33 profit. Traded 0.01 lots. The ICWR from research happens to work for trending day but will blow your account in a choppy market. I intend to continue running this test till the end of October to see what results we get. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Looks good, really ! It's one day of testing only ! Take into account: nowadays we have good strong trends - that's perhaps in your favour. So let it run further not changing anything and we will see the/your results in a couple of weeks.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
those are not bad results eiseprod!! i agree this probably will not work well in a choppy market. i think setting SL and TP would be a good idea just in case. i also think i will do a 4H version too (to help with any chop maybe?) i think it would probably bring better results maybe? also thinking of setting the RSI for 14 day and using an average of the Stoch for 1H, 4H and 1Day, instead of just using 1 day setting. a buddy is doing some testing and has found these settings to be advantageous! (maybe he will chime in?) i hope others might post their results too!!

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hello PipQueen, I know you are busy to found this ICWR based EA Whic follows the rules of the manual strictly. But the EA has some compilation errors. I do n ot know how to code but I was just wondering if you could look into the source code and correct the errors so that it compiles. Let me know if it something that you can do. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Got the ea from this link: https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/173452

--- 帖子 #139 ---
hi Eiseprod, i have "sort of" fixed this ea. i have gotten rid of all the errors, but there are still 7 warnings in it. so i'm not sure it will work for you but it should load. again not sure since the market is closed.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
here is an indie i found some of you might like. it like it since it automatically draws Intraday levels based on the previous day's hi and low's. this picture shows it. ( it is all the "blue" levels. ) the red and yellow levels were manually drawn by me on the day TF.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
yes about the wornings... but it require the icwr custom indicator you have to compile and have it otherwise it will not work. the warning about lines 16 and 17 you can move the assignment of the spread and slip variables at the beginning of the start() function..... i dont know nothing about this strategy .. think ts very old but.. curious to try demo.

It was turnedon around 6.00 am UK Time and turned off 18.00 UK time. 1) The EA took about 11 trades and had a profit of 5.60 2) Not much profit but the most important thing is that it was not a loss .

All kinds of problems on my terminals. Not taking any Dare Me trades or Standard Trades. No error messages in the journal. I have the indy in the correct folder, but it's not loading on startup. Also, when clicking on some of the pairs, an alert pops up stating that trades are being taken, when they are not. The alert is also running in a continuous loop and can't be eliminated, without removing the EA and reloading.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Rob, the dash goes in the EA folder...fyi. i will disable all the alerts this evening. also hopefully do a 2nd dash with 4hour TF for that one. sorry you are having problems....

--- 帖子 #140 ---
i was listening to a webinar today and the guy was saying how some strategies are better during volatile times vs. non volatile times. i'm thinking the dash would be better suited during the asian market(non volatile) and not LO or USD markets. any thoughts anybody?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
The dashboard is in the experts folder, the indy is in the indicators folder, which is as it should be.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hey guys, here is the same dashboard as above, except all times for determining trades are based on 4 hours INSTEAD of 1 hour. i'm thinking of using this during the asian market.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
hey rob, not sure what broker you are using. but if your pair names have an extension, that may be the problem. this dash works fine on oanda . the pair names are EURUSD........no extension.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
My broker, forex.com , has a pro suffix, which I have entered into the EA inputs. So, that's not the problem. I'm still wondering why I'm not seeing the indy load when I put the EA on a chart.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
which indie? the dash is a stand alone EA. no indie is required for the dash.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
My bad - I was under the impression the EA needed to load the original ICWR indy. Now, take a look at the attached screenshot just taken with your new H4 dashboard EA. As soon as I clicked on the usdchf standard trade button, the alert popped up and went into continuous mode and would not stop until the EA was removed from the chart. BTW, no trade was ever placed.

DAY 3 RESULTS Here are the results from yesterday. Basically, I do not put any stop loss or taget. Just wantto see the results in every 24 hour period. From7pm UK Time to 7pm UK Time Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #148 ---
rob, i has to be because of your pair extensions. the alert is being turned on because it went thru the the buy or sell conditions were met, but the trade not placed because i have the pair names hard coded. if you tell me your pair names, i will fix it OR i will send you the mq file and you can fix it yourself if you prefer. either way.....

--- 帖子 #149 ---
that is great!!!!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Good job. Consistency is the key. If you continue to see positive results over a period of time, you can always up your lot-size.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Here's a screenshot of Market Watch and EA input parameters. You can see that I've correctly entered the "pro" suffix to exactly match what's in Market Watch.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
so this is the 1 hour dash that "should" work with a suffix. let me know if it doesn't. i really cant check it since i dont have a suffix. but it compiled without any errors. if it works ok, i will also change the 4 hour, in case anybody wants to try it out.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thank you. I'll fire it up tonight and report back.

DAY 4 TEST RESULTS Dashboard results for yesterday. At about 20.45pm (UK Time, that is GMT+1), I turned on Auto Trading for all the pairs in the Dashboard, using the "Standard" option and left it overnight. £3 loss. Traded 0.01 lots. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I look for pairs that have matching up or down arrows for RSI and STO, in the first two columns, and then click the corresponding BUY/SELL buttons to initiate the trades. This is my basket. The basket can be any number of pairs that meet the trade criteria. I have the basket TP set for $10, so I let the EA close the trades. You only need to put the EA on one chart, which is standard for any dashboard. I go into chart properties and choose NONE for all the inputs, so it ends up black. I haven't really made any attempts to find which session is the best, but NY seems to do well. I just experimented with H4 settings for RSI and STO and that basket also hit my $10 TP. These are all Dare Me trades - if you want to go with Standard trades, you'll have to set MA to True, along with RSI and STO.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
If you select autotrade=true, it will select for you. Also, you can setup sessions for LO and NYO. The time you enter is based on local time..FYI

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Yes, that is correct. I prefer to enter the trades manually, because I check for spread and other parameters. I started using this DB a long time ago, when it was first introduced by GVC in the Platform forum. It's a great DB and very flexible. Thanks for bringing me full circle with this trading tool.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Very Nice!! thanks to everybody for their contributions!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
The way to do that is to have 3 EAs, one on each chart. Set all the TFs on the first EA to H1, second EA all TFs to H4, and third EA all TFs to D1. Make sure each EA has a different Magic Number. I've tested the dashboards I've worked on in a similar manner. You now have 3 different baskets. You also can have different sessions on each dashboard so you can start one session at London Open and close before NY Open, and start another one just after NY Open and close around London Close for example.

Hello pipsqueen, and everyone. I have been variable testing the hell out of this EA and am still doing so, but I have run into some bug issues but as of now with the dare trades set the RSI to 1D and the Stoch to an average of the 1H,4H, and 1D and for a buy the Main&gt;Signal, sell= Main&lt;Signal. I have got the best results with these settings and lower drawdowns.

Dare Me 1H LO...$26 drawdown... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
hey guys, everybody keeps using the Dare Me Trades, but IMO, and as the name implies, which are riskier than the standard trades. but what this means is that you are "probably" opening a trade on the impulse AND on the regression. well we should know that the regression is usually not as long as the impulse. so IF you are not using a small TP like 5, 10 or 15 pips, the trades in the regress direction will probably not be profitable. so even though using Standard trades will open less trades for you, it is probably the better bet because all trades SHOULD be in the overall direction and should go longer (more profitable) and probably all winners. just watch a pair for a few days and see how the RSI relates to the STOCH. you can see this on any chart. so, DARE ME trades = more trades, shorter lengths so MUST use small TP STANDARD trade = less trades, LONGER lengths so larger pip gain and hopefully all winners(except if you get caught in some contrary news). ALSO, this strategy is probably better suited to the asian market since it is less volatile than the others. so a time filter might work better, or using the dare me trades in asian market only and standard trades in LO and US markets. also, care must be taken on which pairs you are trading. usejpy is much more volatile than eurusd, for example. as rob said, he is using it manually. care must be taken on "when" you turn an autotrade on. you can turn on the pairs that are going to be in the correct conditions while you are sleeping or happening during work. i dont think this is a "turn on all the buttons and let it go!" dash. we should still be "babysitting" our charts. just my opinion.... see post 202 for a pic.....

I ran a big comparison this morning on the London open: H1-Dare Me, H4-Dare Me, D1-Dare Me, and H1 Standard. Didn't get one trade on Standard. I'll test it out a few more times, just to give it a fair shake.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
this is an example of how "WHEN" you turn on the AT button is important....... line 1 shows the conditions for a dare trade are good for a buy, but the pair is going down. line 2 shows the conditions are good for a dare buy and standard condtions are about to be valid too! and you can see # 2 is a much better trade!!!

Yes. Yes. Copied RSI code from another dashboard and had &lt; &gt; in wrong direction. That's why we DEMO stuff.

Thanks for sharing the DASHBOARD, but it seems that doesn't work on my mt4. Is that because of pairs suffix on my chart? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi pipqueen18 can you add this on Dashboard which Time frame ICWR M30 or H1 Or Other Thanks

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi pipqueen18 what is the difference . STOCH Number 1 with STOCH number 2. Each of them shows what Why is color different in some currencies. euruds number1 69 red number2 69 blue ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hey ahhamidz....i wouldnt pay too much attention to the #1 stoch. the 3 columns on the right are more correct. i was playing with colors and trying to show a rising stoch value, but i never got the coding correct. the same with the ADX column. i was trying to show a rising adx vs lowering adx. that column seemed to work out pretty well by shading the box to show various levels of adx.......the lighter, the color, the lower the value vs. darker the box....the higher the value. in the picture you posted, speaking about the 3 columns on the right......the idea was if RSI is green, the value is &gt; 50. if RSI is red, the value is &lt;50. if STOCH square is light green(blueish), the stoch main is above the stoch signal. if the square is dark green, this means 3 moving averages are also aligned for a buy.(thus, strong signal). same goes for light pink vs. red. in the SAR box, if the current price is above the sar, it will be green. opposite for red. SOOOOOOO, if all the columns are DARK green or red, this is a better signal than 2 dark greens and 1 light green. hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks sir

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi pipqueen18 If possible . Explain more about ADX . By showing a few pictures Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex...ectional-index above is a link to using adx. it ranges between 0-100. if value is &lt;20, the trend is slow. if value is &gt;50, the trend is strong. it doesnt show direction, only strength of a trend. so the value is the value. and for the color of the square, this is how i coded it: if(adx[i]&gt;22 &amp;&amp; adx[i]&lt;30){Color12=clrLavenderBlush;} if(adx[i]&gt;=30 &amp;&amp; adx[i]&lt;40){Color12=clrMistyRose;} if(adx[i]&gt;=40 &amp;&amp; adx[i]&lt;50){Color12=clrLightPink;} if(adx[i]&gt;=50 &amp;&amp; adx[i]&lt;60){Color12=clrPlum;} if(adx[i]&gt;=60 &amp;&amp; adx[i]&lt;70){Color12=clrIndianRed;} if(adx[i]&gt;=70){Color12=clrMaroon;}

Hello Guys, This is an interesting idea, I started running on 4 charts, dare me trade, 15 min TF on a Demo acc. But I have a few questions, can you please someone summize how dashboard should be used. If I use Templeate it seems there is some problem, it says "TEXT TEXT TEXT" On the EA, which TF it works on? I realized it applys Fibos on 15min, does it matter which TF is the chart on? Does EA close position on TP and apply SL automatically? Thank you for clearing the water.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Candid question: With standard settings, the dashboard ea opens trades at 0.01 lots for each pair traded. This is consistent with your previous image posted where you had 7 trades open, all green (like you said) with a current profit of $2.38. How did it go from $2.38 to the $93 gain posted just after (600 pips ect.)? Does the dashboard ea close the trades automatically or do you do it otherwise?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Default settings. Manually . Not auto. No matter volume

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Seems like a different dashboard as compare to post #265

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I recommend. Let it be a little time. Practice and try. two weeks . You must be successful after that . Can we talk About weakness and strength It's hard to answer these questions. Before trying What time is it in the market? Choose which currency ? TP ? Sl ? Exercise first. Showcase performance

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Do you mean that: 1) you let the ea open the trades and 2) you close them manually What do you mean by "No matter volume"? Do you let the ea open the trades at any time or do you say, for exemple, only the ea to open trades after the London open?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Just for ordering. Not used. For the signal. I use this section of the dashboard

In the middle of the US market. Very low volume. But the order quantity is high. Because the market is not predictable. GBP is weak today. in these cases . The currency in the US market is a bit shaken. That is, if it is strong. Late in the market a bit weak. And if it's weak. Late in the market a bit strong. I order a GBP It has no connection with an indicator or signal. it is Understanding market behavior. I just know two or three behaviors.

I have been testing ICWR the following way, since a week. In morning, before London opens I enable ICWR on six major charts, 15 min TF, 0.1Lot, Dare me trade mode, auto trading. I close all, when I arrive home, late afternoon-early evening, still New York open. All 7 days in profit. I think to improve the system, we need to handle as a basket (daily 50-80 pips, maybe 100 is possible as target). I also started to test standard mode, one day winner is not yet a result, but overall 7+1 days, all in profit equal to a very good-high potential system.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Friday is not that superb, but I closed 6pcs of dare me trade in 13 pips "profit". Overall this week 268 pips profit and 351 pips profit since 2 November. Each days has benn in profit. The standard trades however were closed in 115 pips loss, 32 pips profit in the last two days. I will give them another week on demo before decide and go on live (now I see good chance and prospect)

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Today was a bad day for me on standart the 2 previous days were trade on Dare mode with nice profits for both of them. Total on my first 3 days : 20 win trades / 5 loss trades. So potential is probably here, but have to work more on MM. Basket seems to be an interesting view, but we absolutely need to have a SL = TP or 2xSL = TP but not less

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thank you for the info. How many pips did you gain overall? My staitistics on Dare me trades: 43 trades, 28 (65%) wins, 15(35%) losses, 351 pips profit gain. What do you think: TP as 50 pips and SL at 20 pips for each trades?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
was on 10 pip / 10 pip but not enough good i think the best solution, basket trading with TS mode Need more tests to find best settings

--- 帖子 #271 ---
what are your settings ? do u use default? or can you provide a .set , so we could compare just changing the MM method?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hello Manuoz, I used default settings, since we do not know the limits, I would not change them. I have a proposal for you, - or anyone would like to participate in the FF. - we do a full week testing to compare "manual basket" profitability with fixed TP/SL on both standard and dare me trade. 1. I apply 3.5 ICWR on 2 Demo accounts. 0.1 lot. Always on 6 majors to compare the performance.(gbp/usd, eur/usd, usd/cad, aud/usd, usd/chf, usd/jpy) 2. All are Dare me, opened at by Auto trading before London openes. 3. On the 1st account, I use TP as 50 pips and SL as 20 pips (numbeers can be discussed. We can use also 15pips as SL and 45 pips as TP, for example). 4. On the second account, I manually close them all together, one time. After London closes. You do: 1. You apply 3.5 ICWR on 2 Demo accounts. 0.1 lot. Always on 6 majors (gbp/usd, eur/usd, usd/cad, aud/usd, usd/chf, usd/jpy) to compare the performance. 2. All are Standard Trades, opened at by Auto trading before London openes.(or whenever you can) 3. On the 1st account, you use TP as 50 pips and SL as 20 pips (numbers can be discussed. We can use also 15pips as SL and 45 pips as TP, for example). What do you think? 4. On the second account, you manually close them all together, one time, after London closes. When you have time and feel comfortable. After Friday we share the results here in FF , numbers gained, win/loss numbers. Are you in? What do you think?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Perfect for me. Will do that, so we will compare perfectly our results. Will do tests with both SL/TP you proposed.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
hi, have you backtest using the setting? can share the result?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Today is a bad day. Basket for Dare me ended -21 pip, while orders with fixed TP:50 pips and SL:20 pips all went SL, resulting -118 pip Will continue tomorrow, my feeling is fixed SL either not working or too low.. Anyone experience on them?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I have started too at the LO, but after 10 minutes hit the SL on GBPUSD but EURUSD is in profit.....There was some news about GBP. From now on I will start the EA with 2-3 hrs before London Open, because there are released many news in the LO. Suggestions: -Add a Time Session - Start Hours-End Hours -News Filter -Trailling Stop I think 3.5 ICWR is having great potential. I have a SL of 50 PIPS ( I have read the PDF) My TP1 - I use a traillig stop. My TP2: * Blue Ma Period: 5 MA Method: Linear Weighted Apply to: Close Shift: 0 *Gold Ma: Period: 5 MA Method: Exponential Apply to: Typical Price (HLC/3) Shift: 2 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Good work Palex, can you please update us the results and setting. For me, it seems low sl is not working, probably will try sl 30-40pips and tp 30-40pips from tomorrow. Of course, Basket mode seems a much better option, I would insert that function into ICWR. is anyone still deveoloping it?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Let's fix your problems with TP. I suggest you enter 0 TP and 0 SL in 3.5 ICWR and use this EA with my settings. You need to put this on one pair that and will take care of all trades in your MT4. The EA will auto-modify all your Open Orders, so when ICWR is opening a trade the sleeptight.ex4 will take care of the trade!Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Great, I will try it! Is 50 as TP and 30 as SL would you think is enough to support 6 currencies?(I always open on 6 majors). My guess/less experience with ICRW would suggest SL 40pips and 60/80PIPS as TP.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
TP - as you want (because will use Trailling stop) SL- try 50, I must say that I never hit the SLwith 50 pips, but when I had 20 pips as SL....I was hitting the SL pretty often, because of the pullbacks. These settings are for every trade. The EA is not acting like a basket.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Dears, Las week I did roughly 280 pips profit on Demo with ICWR dare me trade. All were handled as manual basket. Once I got 95pips floating loss, but in the end it resumed and I closed in 5 pips! loss. This week, on 2 demo accounts I'm still running icwr dare me trade. On one, I still manually hand as basket them. On the other account, I use a BMulti Purpose Basket Manager, setting 0.8 % TP and 1.0% SL. So far it closed 2 in profit, but only roughly 58 pips in profit. On manual basket, 2 TPs, one at 43 and one at 30 pips. So this week still in good profit, however Basket Manager needs some fine tune. It is a must because my goal is to run Basket Manager to deal with risks too.
