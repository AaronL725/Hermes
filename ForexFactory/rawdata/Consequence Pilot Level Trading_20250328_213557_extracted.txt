Consequence EL Trading Trade Price Consequence… in other words, follow the price like a hound dog to plant winners. Simply following the footstep of the price by trading the hiccups which automatically keeps you intact with the current direction inside the short TF of 5M. With this method we only look for short gains till achieve the daily goal and turn off the platform. The details… All you need is your two sets of eyes, couple of horizontal lines to determine your next entry and some commonsense. Early Level (EL) … every time there is a price hesitation and 2 candle pullbacks, you got yourself a trade-able Level… You MUST only trade the earliest developed level and be quick to void the previous one. Your have two options to draw your EL's... you can draw it at low or high of the candle (like the chart image below) or at the close of the candle. I personally use both ways depending on the market condition and the size of the wicks... however mostly I use the close. No indicators of any kinds to indicate anything whatsoever.. such as where the trend could be or going to be or turning or whatever a heck else, too much analysis in scalping is irrelevant if you ask me… snipers get snip in the end, lol. Target … I look to snag 5pips out of time unless price in supremely generous and gives away more on some striking move. Stop … I look to not get snagged for more than 5 pips on an average… the goal is to have an average loss of 5 or less. So, there are no set in stone target/stop of 5 &amp; 5 for the purpose of giving the trade the necessary room and time for not falling victim to premature exits. However an emergence hard stop away from the heat, is necessary, ie 20-30 pips... and definitely the stop to not be beyond your opposite pending order so you would avoid being in a hedge situation... one trade out of time and never two open trades at the same time... this will keep you safe from getting stuck in large losing trade to act as a an eliminator. This is very much a hands on style of trading with visual stop/target where it requires a true scalper skill for quick, but balanced thinking, feeling and reacting. The plan is to bank a quick-clean winner, period… anything short of that sequence would consider as a sign of weakness for that level at that time.. which urges the act of survival-seeking play game to exit for the least damage or a breakeven one… and yes, all manual baby. To give you an idea of a busted trade, it would look like: a sharp move against your position quickly after trigger, or a travel of 5 pips or more against your position quickly post trigger, or trade simply taking too much time to make a move either way in a hanging mood… these are all pretty good signs of weakness from top of the list which indicates, to exit, to exit the trade and look for the next one. This thread will show you how to sharpen such skills with my hands on live play with a small TE attached for reviews etc,. I have traded this way for a long time and some of this kind of skills and tactics have been presented and used in my Scalper thread as well which some of you might have followed in the past. Ok… daily goal is 15 pips… the quest to get 15 each day and no quitting till you get it. On the flip side, if you lose 20-30 pips it’s wise to stop for that day. MM … I highly recommend to risk no more than 2%... for beginner’s go down to 1%. The skill full players with small accounts can risk more but no more than 5% ever, with large accounts risk 1%... I personally risk 1% on my large account and for small account like the TE attached 4-5%. The calculation will go like this: balance x 1% / avg loss = pip size ( $1000 x 1% = $10 / 10pips = $1 or 0.10 lot size).. now average loss will vary for everyone... mine is no more than 10pips ever at worst and usually around 5pips. Pair … I only trade the EU for various reasons… low spread, quicker fill, higher liquidity factor as a leading fx pair, more reliable moves and more importantly of all, sticking to one pair for better focus concentration to develop the necessary feel/sense to trade it masterfully. News … watch out for major red EU news… no trade 10 minutes before and after price settle down... prior to news if you got a pending order you should delete it... if you got a ongoing trade I advise to close. Working hours … EU open to close. … and last but not least the good ol Filtering factor … it is useless and I don’t use it, point blank. It only brings second guessing, confusion, complication and worst than all, it would take away the simplicity for not much of a benefit. Please do not bring it here, its a zero tolerance state. Last but not least please be respectful at all times… no arguing, no taunting, no nagging, no whining, no cussing, no overall f-ing around… trading is a serious business, treat it like one… on the flip side, positivity, humor, overall energetic vibrant attitude and activity is fully recommended and welcome. oh almost forgot... a lil about me.. I am a blunt straight talking sob.. but fun loving guy who keeps it real. I think I have covered most… welcome to my thread. Regards, Empire Vocab: EL = E arly E ntry L evel.. QCW = Q uick C lean W inner.. DO = D aily O pen.. DG = D aily G oal.. FO = F ake O ut.. MM = M oney M anagement.. DB = D aily B rief.. My Currency Market/Trading philosophy… The currency market is a market of constant changes and sudden changes… moves happening at will with no reasonably logical or structural elements behind it, period… at least this would be a fact for short term trading. Hedge funds, banks, major players styling long term with all the money in the world and access to plenty of pre-hand information would consider as a different ball game than regular retail trader. Therefore, I do not give any weight to probabilities nor market sentiments… there are no edge based on such market philosophy. The edge ultimately will come from skillfulness of maneuvering with the market. I trade current… what price is presenting at the moment, is what the reality is… so following the footsteps of price will free one from all kinds of analysis paralysis pressures that ultimately breaks down the trader. I am bound to take my chances at the earliest level price presents and to defend aggressively against it in the case of fake outs. I would be involved in any and all market conditions with no fear of losing because of the defensive skill possession. I do not discriminate one signal for another or one market condition, s/r zones, s/d zones or etc, over another… the perception is the reality… no cherry picking, they all present the same amount of chance of achievement and failure. By staying intact with prices footsteps I feel I have the best chance to win in this market with a solid trading plan in place. Trading in such fashion benefits in two major areas… one, guarantees to be in every break of the market which results in not missing out on any wining moves… two, develops this strong sense and market feel to make the better decisions in the heat of the battle… so to say, the more attached and involved, the more intuitive. so as follower you can expect and learn couple of major elements above all as a core.. 1- Learn to attack and defend at the break of all Earliest Levels (EL) 2- Courage and ability to trade all and any Market Condition. Important posts to read as the thread moves on: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post7743448

I would need to give out a brief explanation of the chart above which I would do a bit later. If you have any questions post it and I'll attend to it.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
ok the chart above.. not messing up the EL is very important.. you want to get in at the earliest position possible.. why? well this is the way to fight off chop on super range days. all the horizontal line the red and green are the Entry Level EL.. as soon as you see a move hesitation pulling back with couple of opposite candle forming a the slightest loop alike shape, you should draw your line and place your buy stop order 3-4 tenth of a pips above or below the EL.. the up and down arrow are all the EL who have been triggered for the trade. Now it's important to cancel out the EL's that no longer are valid.. so focus your attention to the blue X and check mark.. this when a the old level is invalid (X) after new level (check mark) in the same direction at earlier position is created.. the new level is the one for the valid play of that direction and the old one to disregarded for ever. The two red X's are just simple example of your last recent EL's to play from.. the upper one valid for buy-stop and lower one for sell-stop. This is an important clarification to keep in mind to implement for better success.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
d i like your way using horizontal line , its seem played S/R or break and hold some level...do you think it will ok if I aplied to hourly candle instead of 5 M candle? secondly, do you consider other line stuff like fibo, pivot, closing day line ? The last one, do you trade London and NY session only ? Best Regards

--- 帖子 #5 ---
It could work on anytime frame but it wont be scalp.. it would need different structure of stops and target I assume. No, I do not consider any of that stuff or anything else.. just commonsense.. for example if the price is at low or high adr I be much more cautious and be less tolerance on possible turbulence and etc.. I trade till I tag my daily goal.. which starts from EU open and take up to close of it.. which overlaps the NY for couple hours or so... but most times I am done before it reaches the end session. The goal is to make money everyday in most minimal time.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hey, good to hear from you Empire, I'm in on this one, even though I'm still using the magic MACD indicator. still trading NY session EST.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Good method but maybe it seems you would be burned in the ranging market, did you try it in what market conditions?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Today i reached my target within couple of hours into eu... but it was a great day to bank a lot more than 15 if i had continued.. however in the same token you would be risking losing out the 15 and get in the dog fight to get back to 15 thinking long run. it's up to each traders agenda to have different approach and tactics to make post trades.. and I do it some times.. l drop the load or maybe when I get lucky on one particular trade and get 20 instead of regular 5.. so I got house money to play now.. things like that. I would consider to post the days chart at end of trading day to see all possible trades and when the Daily Goal was reached and so forth.. talk later..

--- 帖子 #9 ---
good to see you brother, welcome..

--- 帖子 #10 ---
all conditions.. That is why the EL recognition is vital, to even make money in 20-30 pips range or at least survive it.. later on in this thread you would see me hands on in such days as to how it supposed to be handled.. nevertheless, everything has a weakness of some kind otherwise me and you and million of others would have been already a gizillionaire pal, lol

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Subscribed. I like this kind of trading.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks interesting, FX. I will look at at chart or two to see how it works on another pair.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Interesting..... I will follow this one.... Pardon my ignorance.... but how do one insert these short red/green lines on the graph... ?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Using Metatrader 4 it is a trend line

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hello brother do you have plans to share your indicators? Thank You

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thank u Preddy Doubleclick the trendline to put it in edit mode. When in edit mode, right click the line and from the dropdown menu select "Trendline Properties" (first option). You should get a popup form with three tabs, select the tab named "Parameter". Uncheck the box labeled "ray". All sorted....

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Empire, do you have any recommendations on how you would set stops and targets trading this way using 1 hour charts?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
To trade this method you need no indies.. the ones you see in my charts are just simple informational such as clocks and adr.. sure i put the in the first post.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
nothing that i can be sure of to be honest..

--- 帖子 #20 ---
okay cool, thank you for the response. Look forward to learning as much as I can from you. Iv been following your journal for a long time praying you would teach your ways eventually.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
thx for the kind words, hope this thread serves good to you and whoever else that follows..

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Ok the end of the day chart display.. I try to make the effort to do this every night due to its importance.. knowing and becoming familiar with drawing the correct levels are vital.. in the hindsight it's easy to see them, but in real time in the heat of the market it needs extra concentration, solid background in your mind, quick thinking and confidence to act on it.. practice trades will cure all that no worries. Today considers as a great day for this style... within the first a few trades and couple of hours the daily goal (DG) is meet.. but also post DG trades have been also great with producing 8 clean winners for the day and only one bad fake out (FO).. however whats important is to see on daily basis how often and when DG is achieved.. it boost belief and confidence to trade with fearlessly.. I hope it helps. My own trades as shown there too. I have added all the indicators on my chart to the 1st post. see you all tomorrow a bit before eu open.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi, Interesting is this an indicator that shows Support and Resistance? Ron

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes Ron.. that indicator is YOU.. You see it.. You reco it.. You draw it.. no worries it will come with practice and once you have it you own it for good, nothing can take it away from you.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thanx those indis are really helpful.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Morning all.. getting prepared before eu open here.. just some routine to go through before starting your day.. This is what I do.. check the chart of yesterday and where the price is today from days open to now.. I look to see where the daily open is compare to yesterday.. then i check to see where is the main trend.. I see eu bearish as it has been for some time now.. I see today's DO being higher than yesterday and almost back at where the Sep14th drop exhaustion happened off eu rate cut.. which tells me price could be playing inside a 80 pips bear box.. but who the hell knows.. ok.. all that just to keep on back of my mind, self awareness, that's all.. it might come handy when and where things get tight, tough and rough in the heat of the battle.. Now I don't give a hell much about all that.. I go about my business and that is to trade the next EL that I see on my chart to trade from off the eu bell.. as it is visible in the chart I do have a clear long and short EL and short pending on both side are placed with stops out of the way and targets at 15 for a wishful thinking to get the whole DG all in one shot, lol... but my job is to snag 5 and not get snagged more than 5.. all visual all manual.. skill to be put to work.. let's rock..

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Tip for the day to make it your everyday.. Learn to Attack and Defend.. Attack when you must, without hesitation... Defend by dropping your trade, with no feelings attached.. no worries there are plenty of opportunities... and remember.. defense wins championship.. put points on the board and defend it..

--- 帖子 #28 ---
just remembered something about I left out on the my first post.. I also check the news to see if there is any major eu red ones.. try to not be involved much in such times especially having a pending open prior to release.. the real down fall is to get trigger off the gap.. which throws everything off by entering you in at price that its way away from EL.. if your already in a trade and news is coming.. you need to really re-asses and make decision about it.. if it near breakeven, its wise to close it right then for a small loss.. if it a bit farther in loss might want to keep it till you get the slightest chance for resume back to EL for closing at small loss.. with more practice trades in such situation you will get the hang of it of what to do without making a panicky premature decision. anyways, for today you don't have to worry about news at all as there are no red ones.. fair way is wide open, lol

--- 帖子 #29 ---
FX was this a valid entry? took GBPUSD long. trend looked long and daily was green. snagged 5 pips, could have probably squeezed more.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
no that one is late.. you got chance to be in that ride about 10 pips earlier off a valid EL.. I marked your chart..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
long triggered..

--- 帖子 #32 ---
5 in da bag.. This one was easy and made a quick strong bull move.. I closed it quick off the burst bcz it hit the DO and it might have bounce back bear instantly.. i did not want to lose out and take the quick 5.. didn't even let it breath, lol.. same strong move in other spots I just as easily let it run with putting the risk at BE and looking for more but with ready finger to not lose out much.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
nice thread wish to learn from you more !! am subscribed

--- 帖子 #34 ---
can you post your template file

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Ok, price shot up nice for 15+ pips I could have got all my daily doze in one shot, but no worries.. I filled my job duty accordingly.. now.. the deal is to stay intact with the price, focus and concentration.. for the next long EL.. got watch for the next hiccup to become valid.. as for short.. the old one stays intact still till we get one up higher then to move the sell stop up for the new EL.. otherwise the existing one is the only one to go short from.. as I am typing this i see price pulling back a bit, lets see how it shapes up..

--- 帖子 #36 ---
welcome teho.. glad to have you on board

--- 帖子 #37 ---
only if it don't sound like a demand jk.. dear raj, I can't put up a template bcz my chart is versatile where i trade different styles and instruments etc,.. so it's not strict to this style.. my apology in this regard to all.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I see, thank you very much for speedy response!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
There is a little pullback 9 candles before. Why not that one ?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
valid question.. answer.. too tight of a range and not a quite clear loop.. also wanted to see some kind of a movement in Franky before getting wet..

--- 帖子 #41 ---
who can show the last recent valid EL's for the moment..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thank you, but could you please explain exactly, what a " quite clear loop " means.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
im not sure is it the one on top? or below ?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
would these be them?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
like a inside gap... for example for a bear EL.. you need at least couple of bull candle forming before dropping for EL break.. the gap between the couple or a few bull candle and bear candle resumes create this inside gap.. watch the chart example,, the blue shades are the loop gap.. some from yesterdays and the live ones now happening..

--- 帖子 #46 ---
it's not bad.. short one is correct.. but the upper long one is invalid just now as the new one lower has been created.. watch my previous chart.. good job though

--- 帖子 #47 ---
right on.. to all.. guys try to keep your old EL's on the chart..

--- 帖子 #48 ---
long triggered..

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I understand now, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I took the same trade with a TP = 5 pips, there is the 61,8 % Fibo-Retracement

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I missed the one for 0.2 pips...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
now triggered

--- 帖子 #53 ---
ok I closed this on the resume back for a BE result.. this is a good live example of a defend play... price may shoot up.. but i can give a rats ass.. it did not shoot up when i want it too.. showed weakness post my trigger and on the resume back made jittery play.. but in the hindsight it shows a strong 5m bull candle, lol.. next trade..

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi FXEmpire, what buy EL you wil use now?...the old one on the top?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
TP reached = 5 pips.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I considered to do the same, but in this moment the move continued and I let it go.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hey FXEmpire. I like this scalping strategy. I've started demoing it and will continue to do so for a while. I take it from your last trade that once your trade has failed at a level, you will not trade that same level again?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I think im done for the night. Started off a little tough but snagged a nice short on the cable just now and reach 15 pips on the day. FXEmpire if you could please analysis my trades and tell me which ones were valid and which werent that would be great &amp; thanks again for teaching this. first time scalping has ever made since to me. of coarse should have held on to short a little longer...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Do u have a template ? thank you

--- 帖子 #60 ---
great job you did good.. I just stay careful as I trade large lots on my other account where it duplicate the same on the TE account.. so I look for clean winners..

--- 帖子 #61 ---
these are my EL's and pending for as of moment..

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I traded 100 lots, but Demo

--- 帖子 #63 ---
yes, unless price stuck around there way after I am done with old play at it.. post my trigger if it's a failed level i look to survive it on the resume.. so first touch back if its weak it only serves as survival chance.. the on quick re-entry at it.. I wait for some time to see how it's playing around there.. usually you will get a new level a few pips higher or lower after some time and i go off that ones.. hope its clear..

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks, that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
explained in chart..

--- 帖子 #66 ---
keep plugging and you'll someday do 100+

--- 帖子 #67 ---
defensive play out at BE... fine call me a wuss.. lol

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I had a loss here because of a fixed SL.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Do you get out @ -5 or @ -5-spread (-5-3=-8 for example)?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thank you very much again sir!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
if you want to play this with fix tight sl is as good as giving you money to the market in advance, lol.. tight sl is like blood around sharks.. its Forex's nature not to mention the stop hunting factor by beloved brokers..

--- 帖子 #72 ---
np brother..

--- 帖子 #73 ---
nothing fix... i watch the every little detail of pa ticks by tick very closely post my trigger to get a feel if its there to give me 5 pips soon or just not at this time at this level.. There is no set in stone combination or formula to deal with this.. I have tried it all.. best is your focus and feel for that moment.. looking for clean winners and not sweating what i missed or got kicked out based on my own decisions.. there are plenty of clean 5 pips winners also.. I rather defend against the ify ones or jittery ones or indecisive ones etc,.. these early sign of weakness could run wild against you and ruin a whole weeks of work and profitability.. it's tough and rough but very much doable if one act stone cold..

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I see I have to change this. What exactly was the cause for you to stop ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I agree, I asked this question because I see a spread of 3,4 sometimes 5 pips on your screens. So that leaves little room for a 5 pip stop. In my opinion the spread is what makes this difficult. You first have to earn back your spread. So price has to move spread + 5 pips before your TP is hit. Don't you experience this in your trading?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
By the way, have you tried renko for your strategy? Easy on the eyes and could make it even more simpler.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Mr Fxempire, should we long at the breakout line instead ?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Your point would be valid if spread is really that much.. what you see on my screen is 3 or 4 tenth of a pip and not 3 or 4 full pips (0.3 not 1.0) renko.. lol.. it's a good way to be detached from the reality of price movement.. so yes simpler to lose.. and no thanks for me. please read the 1st post about filter talks..

--- 帖子 #79 ---
can you be more clear with you question plz..

--- 帖子 #80 ---
small detail question that you brought up well done.. the answer is NO.. why? the one candle bull pullback is just not enough to consider it as a PB and resume for a level, I consider that as nothing and continuation of that current bear move.. if it's not clear to you I show it in chart..

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hello FXEmpire, If you dont mind i will share my method for scalp...its similar with yours. same TF as well. I just using line to determine SL or TP area combine with cross of MA and "ichimoku alternative". here is the pics and your comment and advice very apreciate. thanks

--- 帖子 #82 ---
thanks for your explanation but i may not understand the differences? i hope u understand for me asking so many question because i am new to this form of trading thanks =D

--- 帖子 #83 ---
It's answered in post #73. Could it be a good idea to watch a 1 min-chart simulaneously ? Another question: Do you trade in the time from about now to NY Open ?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi FXEmpire, not sure if you mentioned this, but do you wait for a breach of the horizontal level or wait for a closed bar beyond the horizontal line. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #85 ---
np.. glad to help.. watch the chart explanation.. the small one is just one candle PB with a immediate shoot down as continuation of the same swing..

--- 帖子 #86 ---
hi ezzy.. just the breach is good enough with 2-3 tenth of a pip.. the plan is to catch the breakout pulse and easier time to play defense in the case of FO..

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I don't recommend it, it's extra noise.. yes i trade the full session until my DG is reached.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I can't really comment much about indicator based systems.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hello FXEmpire, would you please explain how the data info shown on your charts influences your trading. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Nice spreads . I see you use Fibogroup. What do you think about them?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
not significantly much.. is just for more awareness.. for example if I get a itch to make extra trades and then i see the distance to low or high is not favorable then I pull the breaks,lol... that's as much as influence it goes..

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I think about them as much as they ever think about me no broker talk bud..

--- 帖子 #93 ---
clean 5 in da bag.. about 10 for the day so far

--- 帖子 #94 ---
thank you i clearly understand from the pictures congrats on ur last trade !! =D

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks.. need one more

--- 帖子 #96 ---
short right now Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
nice valid one.. i stepped way for a few minutes and missed it..

--- 帖子 #98 ---
i froze this picture to show you guys on how to play such scenarios.. as you see nice break of EL to about 4 pips just short of the goal.. an back up with turning a shadow to EL... I would on such scenarios be alerted and qualify it as a weak one and would take the first chance i get to exit for +4 or lucky if 5 when it touches back the LL again.. and defensively to exit at around BE when it touches back the EL again... this is the way you can stay safe while your attacking on every valid setups.. so navi if your in.. take your 5 pip now and feel superior, lol

--- 帖子 #99 ---
+5 pips banked, yeah

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I exited with 2 pips, because I expected a possible turn because of a trendline

--- 帖子 #101 ---
nice one

--- 帖子 #102 ---
+ 9 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #103 ---
whatever that gives you edge in your mind and belief.. ask of me.. most of everything besides my feel and gut is nothing but a crutch..

--- 帖子 #104 ---
gorgeous... nice one.. I am envies, lol.. again stepped away and missed it.. this is as sexiest as a 6 foot blond banging body .. so much for that TL of yours bud.. crushed like pancake.. on the previous +2 out plays.. you did the right thing.. and as you see the hiccups can get you back in the play if it's meant to run..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
man the bear are coming in at Eur again !! congratz all who profited

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I like your opinion, I think I will trust my feeling more in the future.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
SUBSCRIBED! one of the best thread. very clean chart without spider man's web that can only make eyes sore. i like it very much.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
The second time you miss. Do you have bladder trouble ?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
it's been bear all though way for the over quarter, it's hard to be over looked.. every time that pulls back it's in the waiting to drop back down and I personally watch extra carefully every time I go long off the top of PB point when i am scalping like today as i exit very rapidly on the 1st three buys that i took.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Are these levels correct? I like this method, thanks for posting.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
lol.. na just tired been in front of the system all day.. no excuse though it turned out to a great day for the method.. glad to see people enjoying it

--- 帖子 #112 ---
look for early entry levels.. and post it again..

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I couldn't agree more, all the best.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Is this better?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
oh ya... now your not getting chopped..

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #119 ---
well done boys.. Yankee boys took it back up.. perfect up and down day.. as you all see there will always be plenty of clean winners.. must learn to play defense to not give away before it starts giving..

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I think the key is to handle the situation immidiately after the entry.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks FXEmpire nice and good system which works. i added one indicator to find levels hope u don't mind for sharing it this how it looks on chart. regards jeet

--- 帖子 #122 ---
yw.. no i don't mind.. its a good indi where it appear to be catching most if not all the EL's.. it works great for experience folks like myself and others where saves time to draw etc,.. however I wanted people at first to learn to do on their own to grasp the idea fully, and it also creates this extra focus/concentration that does a lot of good things unconsciously think and draw it manually. ps) on a second hard look at it i see it drawing levels a bit too aggressively catching every little tiney move without much of a loop gap of one candle drop... so yourself and anyone else that might be using it keep this little detail in mind and try to not fall for it.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Moved SL to +0.1 when price stalled. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Aren't those levels your indy plots just fractals?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) + 1 pip. I think it's enough for today. Have a nice evening.

Hi Udine.. thanks bud for the kind words.. great to see you drop by. stay green.

Thanks FXEmpire for your valuable insight.

Ok here is the day end chart with all the valid EL's.. today considers as another good day where there was about 8 possible setups with 5 clean winners no losers and at worst BE.. but the most important thing is that DG was reach within 1st three to fifth trade on the before nys open. yellow lines are all levels where turned to blue when was triggered as EL. My own trades are visible with the drag thing.. I should have done better today if had not missed couple of solid clean ones.. still though pretty happy with days result. it was nice to see everyone active in live moments and making green pips. see you all tomorrow.

Hi FXEmpire Thanks for sharing your knowledge and system. Is there a chance you can make your chart examples a little larger and maybe a different background color. I have trouble clearly seeing some of your charts with the small candles &amp; black background. I do think you have discovered an excellent scalping technique. While reading your thread I remembered a comment by PIPEASY (Equity Millipede), an excellent trader- He said he looked for areas where price "needed" to breakout from. That is what you seem to have mastered. Thanks again for sharing. gmcc

Morning to all.. Preparing for today's trading.. Yesterday was a up and down kind of a day which is one of the better condition for what I or we do here.. The only condition that really could cause some problem is the really really thigh range.. however if one does not fully learn absorb and practice enough the Defense game then leaving yourself vulnerable for any condition. it was a range kind of day till some bear momentum kicked in when NY session came to play nothing significant but solid enough to create some really great clean winners for us. EU's main trend as usual for over qtr time has been bearish however currently is been playing inside a 80 pips bear box.. that is why it is so important to reco the the earliest EL's and to only act on those.. you definitely don't want to be late getting on board. The chart below is my EL's to start of on the edge of franky O. one tip.. I draw my starting EL's first when i look at the chart.. but my pending off whatever level is still available only 5-10 minutes before franky open, don't want to be involved in any trigger prior to the EU open. Good skill to all.. let's rock

sorry for my horrible english i try forgive the SL... why i entered badly?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
it's ok I just did not understand exactly what you were trying to say.. firstly try to read the first post and try to understand it fully. look.. the concept of this thread is getting in early.. early entry level (EL).. trading the regular support and resistant is just like another of many s/r thread in FF.. trading in such fashion has higher risk of getting chopped around in the range markets, mostly for larger damage.. what I do and have offered here is to minimize that and even make money in such tight ranges as well as still turning in profit on nice looking trending days and most other conditions... with some defensive skills one would be able to survive almost all conditions but when and only EL is applied.. that is the niche or edge.. i hope it makes sense to all..

--- 帖子 #165 ---
pending set both ways on the earliest EL... this how you squeeze in trades if it's meant to stay or form a range.. even if it goes just barely side to side you would get your tp.. the risk of getting FO at the top or bottom of brackets or traditional S/R is more than any less than EL's.. if it's mean to not stay in range.. well you are in earlier and maybe even get more than your target.. if it mean to stay, you still most likely would get your +5 when it makes a small burst to top of bottom of the box.. if it's stay in the box and take its sweet ass time well then it's slow enough for you to make a BE out after some time.. just some scenarios run through of different options that price can throw at you... however it's too vast to put a cap on.. that is why i call it the beast.. but I enjoy head butting with the beast, lol. my first trade, the short.. just ignore that folks.. its total miss management from my side.. that trade at worst should be a 5 pips loss when it resumed back couple of time.. i was just a bit busy.. or just simply stupid. anyhow it's good example to see live to not ever get cut like that.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
my current chart with trades and exits.. ignoring the 1st trade which is still running.. i totally f-ed up that one.. even if i BE that one is a disaster. but the other 5 trades where all of them turned to be a FO.. but the net loss between them all is 10 pips.. for avg loss of -2.. that's the kind of defense is needed to get by terrible days like this when its moving horribly.. the one clean buy winner earlier would have easily wipe that, which i missed, lol .. so not a great day for me.. but still i am ok if i defend as such.. and wanted to point it out for your knowledge and confidence if this is you thing to follow.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
wow, the PA is terrible today.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
sure.. so it is at least half the time.. the question is what are you going to do about it..

--- 帖子 #171 ---
haha, yeah you are probably right. Good defense is what is needed. I've been struggling a bit with that today. I'm unsure whether I should exit immediately after there is some hesitation or to give it some more time. Out of my 7 entries, I've only managed to defend 2 properly. The 3rd one happened to be the only runner we had today.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The best structure that I can give out is to.. - think survival on the 1st sign of threat against your position.. - Think Exit when the threat seems real.. - next is, to act stone cold.. price reaching anywhere close to your entry.. outtt, period. anyways this is what i do.. and has kept my head above water for many years.. ok rip, lol

--- 帖子 #173 ---
My performance: 8 trades, 1 win, - 6 pips for the day, all is possible.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
well done..

--- 帖子 #175 ---
hi fxempire, what is the best defense to do when the price move fast enough against you and not able to exit quickly? do you wait for the next pullback to lessen the damage or you just accept the losses as it is and move on? will appreciate much your answer. was able to do good defence yesterday but today seem so difficult.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
great question.. valid concern This is the hardest situation to defend against.. I would not accept the loss right away.. but right away i would consider such a fast move against my position as a real threat.. so.. I would look to exit this on the same candle with giving it one chance of resume and make out there fora small loss.. if it does not give me that.. then all there is left is to see if it pulls back like saying it yourself and even settle for larger loss than normal 3-5 pips. now why i would not accept the loss right away on a fast move against.. bcz if i do that then i create this habit of making panicky exits all the time on almost every little move against my positions which would result in missing out on a lot of winners. This is the most effective and honest answer i could have given you. same kind of a deal happened to me on this very day on my first trade, the short one.. it moved away very fast without a chance on the same candle.. then i waited for the pullback after it's burst.. which it did give me the chance to get out at -5 even -3, and that is great.. but i was on the phone and did not act on it quick even though i was watching it. however once in while no matter what you will get cut for one reason or other, and its part of the game.. but for the most part if your trigger trade is not involved inside red news zone, then price would give you a second chance off the pullback. all in all above everything else it's important to never get emotional in such situations.. and then one would survive even the mountain top.. i believe that. I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
yes of course it help much, exactly what i want, being panicky will prevent much loss but might miss the ride if ever it will continue in my direction. i now prefer for a bit more loss and wait for the next pullback if exit is really the right defence. thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
YW jack.. I am glad you brought this concern up.

I know. I've been looking for a new broker. Best I can find have 1.2 - 1.6 on eurusd (ECN or NDD for what that's worth). I know there are brokers with smaller spreads but I think most of them are real bucketshops. If I had 0.1 spread I would have been done for the day. Now I can only trade big momemtum bars without hesitation.

Ok, day ends chart here with some humble explanations.. Today we danced with the price inside a 55 pips range where it was rough and tough at times not making clean moves from EL.. but it's nothing unusual, its a given.. The key in such days is to not be effected much in order to all of sudden stop playing defense or become trigger less.. a few unsuccessful trades can do this kind of damages, but, only if you allow it.. otherwise it's nothing but a passable pump. ok.. as usual the yellow are all levels and blue are the ones that has got trigger as EL's.. there was 9 trade-able signals where the early ones were rough but N.Y session seemed to give out couple clean ones.. if during London you played good defense and stayed on course through out the whole session then you should have even got the daily goal.. all my trades are visual.. and again just ignore my first trade which is still running.. its good example of "what not to do", lol I be around for lil while longer if you got questions otherwise see you all tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Couple of questions: How do you watch a chart all day, 5 days a week and not burn out? You're only looking for 15pips a day so to make those hours pay you need some leverage right? I presume you're not playing for a $ a pip. So to keep the leverage high and the percentage traded as low as you say at the beginning of the thread we need a lot of capital. What amount of capital are you trading if you don't mind?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I ask you a question.. How do you go to a regular work all day working for someone else and not get burned out?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I see, that's a pretty defensive reply, I thought it was a reasonable question considering the amount of concentration needed to scalp the market all day long.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
not defensive at all.. it's just a valid counter question.. you talk about burn out.. it's the greatest job in the world.. if your a decent trader.. you make just as much as of a regular job if not more, but with no boss, not much of a grueling hours as regular job or even better if you got your own business, working from your own home office, no employees, inventories, no dumb as colleagues next to you, lol, etc,. now talking numbers.. ok here it is.. a capitol as little as 10k.. avg loss for this method is no more than 10 pips if your lousy and if good its even lower like 5 or 7.. but let's take into account 10.. so 10k x 1% =$100 / 10pips sl = $10 per pip (1.0 lot size) $10 x 15pips a day = $150 a day x 5days a week = $750 wk (7.5%) = $3000 mo (30%) let say your a half ass trader and you avg 3 winning day out of the week you still make around 15-20% mo.. now is that fucking great or what.. lol lets now do this on a 100K cap.. it comes to what, 15-30k mo, not bad at all.. .. and if one don't have 10k,should just do a favor to get out of the industry.. or.. one needs to risk 3% or 5% to compensate the lack of capitol.. but now its even more of a mental game on the flip side. so you can not possibly be more burn out than a regular job or your own small business.. right!! However, the point of this thread is to show a craft and skill that could last for rest of ones life time.. then once that's out of the way.. your the boss of your own destiny to curve this in to anyway and how based on your goals and agendas risk and reward wise. The purpose of my involvement in here is just that.. to pay it forward and spread good karma. anyways Q, if i came across a lil rough my apology i am just a little blunt overall but superbly real and sticks to reality of matter.

short out.. I froze this picture quickly just to show you how you act on the heat against your position.. as you see a pretty sharp move against the position.. once you see this.. its considers as a major threat against your position all at once, its better to cut it off while it's still small.. and don't even give a rats ass of the outcome later on, it's simply irrelevant.. live to fight another day and take it down then..

--- 帖子 #203 ---
this was a very risky trade men

right on good for you.. I got the same spreads pretty much.. but i also pay some commission .

Nice setups! Do you think HA makes it easier for you to see the EL's? I know no broker talk. But since a small spread is a main factor of the system I would like to know which broker you use. Would you mind sharing that?

i wish you have more success for both thread and trading...i am sure about that. and i like the idea to turning 200-300 buck into million in a year or less....when we see trading competition result , the winner can make 500% or more in only a week ..dont know how they make it happen...perhaps nothing to lose mentality cos no real money there but if the winner play real and reduce target to only 1/5 or 100 % it still amazing. We all know the potentially are there (with the potential risk offcourse LOL) ... it seem easier to said then to done. If only the veteran of forex competition champion out there could share their experience/strategies...just please PM me ( i dont wanna disrupt this thread with other things but FXEmpire trading system) Happy weekend all, cheers

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I know this is off topic of the thread (Empire won't mind if I offer him some nice vino ) but I just wanted to butt in here re. competitions. I entered one once (ok, laugh) but never again . It's about max-ing out on every trade and crossing your fingers you don't get a margin call. You have to take the biggest risk you can and hope you can get away with it. The leaders are the lucky ones; nothing to do with competent trading! Anyhow, they only have to survive a few weeks, maybe a month or two. Make them do it over a year and I bet you every account would be blown.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Further to my previous post, I like to add that maybe you might be interested in checking out Rags2Riches thread. The idea is that you start with an insignificant amount and risk high on high probability setups. I don't think anyone actually achieved it, mainly because as your account grows, so does your fear factor. Perhaps an EA might be the best bet, lol, not that I believe EA's really work long term, but you'd have better odds than doing the lottery.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
What i am seeing on trade explorer is that trader has not stopped the losing trade. so its generating 61% loss. This almost happens to all of us when we don't cut the losing trade , its human nature to give a bit more time to a matter just delay it so it might come in to profits. When it comes to trading we try to do the same thing some time it works and we are happy , but some times it don't work we are not happy about that , the horrible thing is that if it don't work it takes full account and we are left with no money in account. We should use a hard SL on trading account or a soft SL in our mind that if losses go above certain amount we are going to close this trade and accept the reality that we lost that trade.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
i assume Empire will agree with "hot" off topic disscussion ( cos jen factor ). anyhow this is market close ...(when all indi looks perfect to pointed when to buy/sell and when to close as well ). I agree some point of you regarding high risk technique/competition style or whatever...i like your quote "cross your hand" after enter the market. i hv experience with it...mixed fear n hope in my head lol. other thing...i still believe and technically it s posible to make high risk technique riil happen and consictence, the problem i think is on fundamentaly ...the enemy is myself ....i believe Empire ways one of the answer ! In add, when we choose swing trading-----just look at EU movement for past several weeks...(i believe some bulls suck out from 13300 level hope for a little retrace first)

If I ever was to enter a competition again (which I won't) I would use the most aggressive martingale with no stop losses . Just hope I'd survive the length of the contest.

I don't mean to ridicule you and i don't follow anyone , the idea was or point behind the post was how to avoid such a situation. When you trade in percentage account size don't matter you just look at % gained or lost. For small accounts you surly can gamble it if you want.

guys I want to elaborate on that short trade where it's left open.. which i have already talked about it in recent posts. That trade is a damn good example of "what not to do".. if I were you I would pin that to the desk top, and name it "empires goof" lol, I don't care as long as it serves a benefit, that what matters. I am not going to make excuses about that trade as to why and what.. but just for the record.. this was a very small account ($300) just for illustration.. for the purpose of reality and hyper/timing type of scalping that I display here where real followers could go over it at their own time and fully absorb and take away what they need to take away from. I obviously don't care about $300 or turing 300 to 600 or 1000 is such and such time.. so I am not paying my full attention to it at ALL the time, even though i tired by this one slipped, and will happen again unless i do something about it.. .. and that is.. from knowing myself, i would need to operator on a larger amount in order to care and not slack from.. so I will designate an appropriate amount just enough to fit the purpose of this thread with my full attention as I give to my major accounts. I did not want to budget much or spread my attention to an extra account for this thread, but since now I see interests and followers I would make this effort. anyways, just wanted to keep you inform. we'll rock from Monday on to Christmas.. at least that's my plan to finish the year strong, with the summer time behind us and full fledged trading ahead. ............................................. The purpose or mission statement of this thread is two important elements.. if your really interested, raise your hands and if there is enough of you then I tell you where if your a true follower then you can head on with clear vision.

I just saw your post sam.. let me walk my dog and then I grab a my vino and go over it..

Here are my hands! Ready and committed!

Here are my hands too! It is a so simple system and I believe that it is profitable too.

Sam it looks pretty good.. you see the EL's very nicely even inside such a super tight range.. there are couple of minor matters that i picked up but overall really great. Now watch the chart that I have posted and those are my EL's.. you would see a couple maybe that are a bit different and that is due to me not qualifying the level due to not seeing enough of a gap/loop or qualifying triggers that might have happen with even just a touch off of new but very close EL compare to the old one. also the shaded box is the news time.. we don't want to be triggered at the release and that's bcz you can get slipped pretty large and be involved in whiplash.. so 10 min before delete the pending wait till dusts settles. ............ to Sam and all.. Yesterday was a great example of operating inside the tightest range possible and still come up with some pips or survive it.. which is great bcz one has guaranteed to not miss winners and stay intact with the price to eventually lead you to good clean winners. so da name of da game is to attack and defend and be as tough as a nail.. bcz the clean winner are around the corner if one don't dug one-selves into a too deep of a whole then then DG is just matter of time each and every day. Don't ever be afraid to attack and be strong and clod to defend act. dump a trade like it's a piece of garbage bcz it obvious when its not there for profitability or making it tough.. the only thing that can come in between is YOU and your emotions.. keep that stone cold and you be fine. it sounds like a good talk.. but stay with me and we do the walking as well.. and with enough practice under your belt it will sound and become real.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yes, you've got to dump that loser and do it properly... damn, you could have bought me a pressie with that money rather than give it to your broker! I've been eyeballing your charts and I have to admit they make a lot of sense. But your TE is crap, so sort it! Your trades are really mini-breakouts and it looks like you bag your pips before the retrace back to the level. So, bearing that in mind, would a tight trailing stop be beneficial? Just a thought... I might try it one day when I've the time for a bit of scalping.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Flav good to see you back on board

--- 帖子 #255 ---
oh jenny I don't know why I can't just dump you like I do to other honeys, lol, especially when you get so tough on me.. ... by the way, that TE is beautiful.. you just got to read the lines in between sweetie .. The answer to your question is... is... is... da drum roll please.... NO.. absolutely NOT.. .. you'll rather loser a few pips more at times than let some machine be in charge. You will never learn the skill that you need to possess to succeeded when you let the damn machine to do it for you, come on nowww.. skill will stay with you for ever but the machine will not.. beside that it just won't work with the TS or anything UN-manual.. don't want to go in depth on that. Love you jenny.. .. oh boy now.. here come the EA nerds at me...find me a spot to hide, lol .. before and if you decide to do so just know that it's zero tolerance state for me.. so let me and my thread be away from all this stuff plz. I am trying to give people how to fish. Thx in advance. ...................................................... ps) by the way folks.. me and jen101 are good long ff friends so i joke around with her just for fun.. and she only allows me to do so for whatever reason besides my hunky looks of course ... so no funny feeling boys.

Morning to all... New week to look forward too and I wish everyone success. Main trend for EU obviously still bearish spending inside a bear box for week now... I see the DO (daily open) on top of the box... with not much news on tab for the day and major player will hold thing till u.s rate announcement on Wednesday I would expect the EU to play inside the box, so bear is more lucrative today. With all that said... I look for the next EL either way, lol... Attack and Defend As you might see I got the account load at 4k like I had mentioned... so I'll be trading this TE account for serious as well. good skill to all, happy green hunting... let's rock baby...

--- 帖子 #259 ---
1st trade short out at 1.5.. the initial break was weak.. then the following candle looked good but then again showed weakness with candle against.. i gave it chance on this current candle for the first minute that also made no move.. so all in all for final decision to out it.. this could drop.. but is not doing it the way i want it... and the way I/we want it is what????... you guessed it... CLEAN... so what it does after I am out is irrelevant to me... even it runs to moon... that's the attitude you atta approach this guys...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
good morning, green pips to everybody!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
One important matter guys.., Journal your trades at all times... as soon as your done with a trade, journal it... know where your standing for the day... that's dollar wise and mental wise... end of each day go over it... and later on over the weekend for the week review. extremely important...

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Show me/us your current live EL's... It will help you and others to get better... this should become so clear and easy for you the you could even do it in your sleep... the quick reco on the el's helps you in many areas... it will keep you intact with the price, like dancing with a partner... since it keeps moving your able to stay with it if you already have been on top of the last before reco-ing the correct next one... you got to on the spot to see the new one and voiding the next one... here is mine for now... the current long EL could become a void as a new one up lower could be in the making.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
example of a how to quickly void a EL when new one is created ( watch the chart)... once you reco this quickly then you should move your pending or to the new level..

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hello Empire and all, have take a short 12945 (a little bit late waiting candle close that not suppose to do) will post pict later...

--- 帖子 #265 ---
here it is, clean 5 pips winner... so if its intention is really to run bear... then you will capitalize on it as well, you be there for it... the only difference is you will be with it when it does it cleanly... keeping it solid but safe..

--- 帖子 #266 ---
example of quick el reco... two candle pull and you got it... reco it and tag the line... now this one is easy and clear... I just wanted to illustrate a clear two candle pull to be good enough for el to be confirmed...

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Was a bit greedy. Sorry, wont happen again

--- 帖子 #268 ---
hey man no apology necessary at all... if you can do it, why not... but its got to be consistent in order to not get hurt in the long run... great job anyhow... I personally feel I can get more ONLY if i see a super strong move where it moves fast every seconds/minutes without much of a hesitation throughout the whole length of the move, whatever that maybe 15, 20, 30 etc...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
just close @ 12933(a little bit greed) ...will waiting short trigger again, might be target down around 12914-12920 area..

--- 帖子 #270 ---
out at BE.. ugly initial trigger candle, followed with another one and next one did not make move early on.. so outtt.. avoid getting bottom..

--- 帖子 #271 ---
take another short @ 12931 and close @ 12918(as expected)... Empire, i am sorry that i am break the rule for TP 5...not to influence or nothing else. to make it clear for you and others that i hv set my own discretion on TP (usually around past S/R)...when price @ 5 pips green i will wait if it run or hold or back. sometimes i was lucky get more than 5 as bonus and other case i loss more even hv potential gain @ 5 green...i accept that and i think its fair enough..other reason my SL more than 5 before spread around 1,8 (the point is i need more than 1 : 1 RR) to cover my loss. ---- This system make me hot... ----

--- 帖子 #272 ---
its not a problem at all... as I mentioned in my first post, tp/sl are not a set in stone rules... use your discretion and whatever you can to get more... it just has to be consistent to serve you good, that's all.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Many Thanks...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
we'll compare results at end of the month year

--- 帖子 #275 ---
another clear example of void EL when new one is formed.. this example is from both side (chart) it might even become tighter, and you would go along with it...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
close for 3.5 pips...seem price respect 12915 Support... Will only buy @ 12933 target 12945 or above(if continue up) on contrary...will load BIG sell if break 12915 (last friday hold this level). might be wrong (have many experienced with it) -- time will tell

--- 帖子 #277 ---
out at half pip.. gave it a lot of time bcz i liked the break but turned.. I gave a bit of a chance on the resume too, but did not drop.. next..

--- 帖子 #278 ---
got busy with couple of back to back trades.. first the last short, which faked me out nicely, had the chance to get out at -2 but held it for a bit longer and it got me for more, eventually accepted the large loss of 7, even though I favor bear move here, it's irrelevant. .. then, the second trade long which i closed for BE, made the appropriate play there.. new EL's are placed with PO ready to go.. NY just opened..

--- 帖子 #279 ---
ok the last short trade came just a hair short of hitting my tp and bouncing back up without looking back... I end up closing it for a BE, most time in such scenarios pa stings you bad after missing a tp.. so not falling for it taking the safe side outing at BE and continuing on... control a bit of unfortunate day for me... but it's all good I seen worse..

--- 帖子 #280 ---
best learning today...the plan was damn good...loading 6 ball SHORT and hv chance to close at profit...suddenly price go up quickly...if not throw 6 ball i will hold a little bit...(whipe out all the gain today...but not loss ). didnt see support @ 12907...

--- 帖子 #281 ---
you went long from where?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi. Firstly, nice thread FXEmpire and interesting strategy, congrats. I have being reading along as the strategy sparked my interest due to a similar type of strat I used to trade when I was (more) newb. I'd forgotten the strat I used and this thread reminded of it, it was probably the most success I had back then but my MM let me down. I have started practicing on demo and did some trades over the weekend on a strat tester and am happy with results so far. I took the trade (sell) two trades ago (in at 1.2926). I decided to risk 7 pips up to the buy level break that didn't get triggered and price dropped to TP region. I generally do everything manually and unfortunately I got distracted by my live trades on Gold so missed closing out, but still was a good result and I consider a win. Again thanks for sharing your strategy and thoughts Empire and GL with your thread.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
i had been all mornig out of my home.. now, time to trade

--- 帖子 #284 ---
long good for a winner.. news help there... I had a hard tp on this bcz wanted to get this on the flash as I need a win.. worked well.. this is part of daily management decisions to stay on course..

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Buy level broken (1.25298). Letting it run for a bit as appears a BO.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
+9.4 Edit: -.7 comm.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Thank you.. good luck as well.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
im working in 1min chart with very good results. TP is defined in +2 or +2.5 pips. this is an example. the last long that i made: u can download from my mega account (video). https://mega.co.nz/#!LkQWTCKJ!hvjy2Q...WUGawXLW3O5CGk

--- 帖子 #289 ---
for me, is more easy recorder the screen that take a photo. with videos and evernote my life changed xDD

--- 帖子 #290 ---
@ 12917 3 ball (since know false break @12915..its big probability to go long)... truly its much more driven by revenge emotion not solid plan.(i am just lucky) if wrong i will let it floating till profit...or will hegde if break 12915 again. lock pips now... enough for the day...i am out. thanks

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Got to ask (haven't downloaded) are you using pending, set TP/SL on demo? If it is the case there is a good chance your strat wont work due to slippage on live acc's. Dam friggin IC Markets demo acc's, they always freeze. I'm long @1.29368. Hopefully not overstretching the strat as it was a fairly tight pullback (loop). +5.5 net, feel like I could of let it run a bit.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
sam... please keep your entries within the scope of thread... otherwise your trading totally something else. Thanks in advance brother.

is this the entry that i preach here??

nop, is a little short from blue line to down

keep the entries clean to the scope of the thread navi. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yes, big Brother. Respecfully, sorry for that...a bit explanation to make clear i am new in practise your system(a couple days) and you know i hv old habit as well. furthermore, just please look at the pics below....all my trade almost close to follow your rule---(i know some bit early and some bit fast)...except no 3 and 5 its all match your rule...number 3 yes its totally not, number 5 should be taken @ number 6 cos emotion case i hv post. about EL ----decision when to take a trade...i am filtered by S/R zone since i hv large SL (see picture) so i will take trade with the probability that match with my stop(the point is not all trigger i take). about TP----we have discuss before as i am filtered by S/R as well. about total entry/lot i wont post or did that again...i know its shouldnt. the last, i will OUT for a while, will catch you later.. thanks and success Big Brother

--- 帖子 #298 ---
the pic was forgot to post...he he

--- 帖子 #299 ---
If you use filter for this method you will not succeed in the long run.. it's point less.. your trading the 5m earliest entry point.. another words, it's mostly noise.. so cherry picking based on some filtering tactics will hurt more than it benefits.. and it's totally some other system. you may have misunderstood this thread... in here as it has stated in the first post we follow prices footsteps.. trade every signal and play defense as a safe guard, instead of using all kinds of fancy tactics or indies to predict. I hope its clear.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Bah, just realised I missed that level (1.2944) just before price reached it and couldn't open fast enough. Still it was (would have been) another successful trade.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
That'll do me for today, time to crash (bed). I had 3 successful trades though the management was lacking on the first due to commitments on other charts. Also missed that last (4th) trade that I only saw as price was coming down. There maybe a couple of trades I missed between the trades I did trade but will hopefully get better at spotting. Day #1 gets the tick ps. ignore the silver trade, it's just an old demo acc I'm using.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
short good for 4 pips.. I may have missed a EL earlier on top.. but this one luckily worked..

--- 帖子 #303 ---
what is wrong in my enter bro?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
everything... you don't even a have hiccup on the 1m much as less in 5m where what this thread is based on. please read the thread.. the 1st post a few times.. and review my charts.. and then compare with yours.. you should see whats wrong. I know you got some language barriers but still you should make the effort to understand the core concept of this threads entry.. the EL setup.. use Google translator or something. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Here is my day end chart... as you see i have stayed intact with the price all throughway through for the whole day.. simply following its foot steps and taking action on every valid EL. Total of 10 trades manged to make some money but overall not so great as I did not quiet capitalize the full amount of the targets in three occasions and did not meet the DG. Today was a 64 pips range but the action around EL's trigger time was mostly all tough, so that's why it caused me to bail sooner than real break happening.. better be safe.. I grade myself a C for today, lol, I can do better. see you all tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I respect your discipline. You stuck to your guns and traded the system as it was meant to be traded to my understanding. You were on a defensive stance as PA didn't give it up easily and that will save you losses in the future. Well done and keep it up .

--- 帖子 #307 ---
FXEmpire thank you for displaying your trading method. Wonderfully simple. May I respectfully suggest placing your EL triggers at the close of the bar. This allows an even earlier entry to make those precious pips and reach that DG more quickly. Indeed it even allows one to turn to the elegant simplicity of the line chart to put the triggers in place. I drew them in place in purple to give a clearer picture. Blessings. Bat

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Good morning... Getting prepared for the day here... after breakfast I give out my Daily brief.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Daily brief.. As usual main trend on EU is Bearish and has formed a solid bear box for about week now... I see the DO in the middle of the box slightly leaning more towards the top bracket... recent daily action has been around 50-60 pips mostly for a day up and day down. I expect the same range to be commanding till Wednesdays u.s rate announcements. Weeks with such major announcements awaits, could be tricky with sudden minor moves, which for scalper like us makes it bit difficult and got to be on our toes.. that is one of the reasons i am a bit extra defensive and only look for clean quick winners.. the less time your in the market the better.. so FIFO is the play. News wise, today we got German Z couple hours inside the londi session and ppi when NY kicks off... hopefully prior to NY we get our daily doze. Trade well. Let's rock..

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thank you matt

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Batavier.. I like it.. it's a great suggestion, it's bat-man like, lol .. done.. that's what we will do. The earlier to get to +5 is what I am all for and it will help out for better defensive play. .. however it may not be better to go with close bar is some rare cases.. like inside tight tight ranges maybe or not so clear EL's.. so if you got any data on that I greatly appreciated if post it with charts.. thx.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
1st short trade winner +5.. as you see price threw a gap and platform froze... so i just took the cash immediately..

--- 帖子 #313 ---
2nd trade long good for +4.. It took a while and i was ready to even dump it on the resume, considering being right at the DO and making jittery moves.. but as you see the resume candle it was too strong and I held it and banked right at end of the hourly candle and new one.. happy with that result.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi On close of which bar have you placed your ELs for the last 2 trades? It seems as if you have not been defensive on the last long trade

--- 帖子 #315 ---
by looking at my chart and zooming in on it you should see where i exactly put them.. there is also the TE at your disposal to help out even further. about defensive... i thought i gave a good explanation about it on my last post.. but to add to it... you see the wicks.. that also gives confidence that there is weakness on the short side too.. so on the strong resume instead of making a out at BE area i held it a bit longer within seconds it got near my target.. so banked it quick. so keeping greed in check where a losing trade turned to a decent winner.. grateful and preserve. I hope it clear

--- 帖子 #316 ---
As you've said Empire, there are times to be defensive and times to attack Just wondering, if choose to hold a position on a small pullback and it ends up making a new EL do you keep it open for the new TP level or are you just happy to bag the previous (original) EL pips?... if you get what I mean Edit: Perhaps not completely clear so PA goes like this- open @EL price goes a bit higher, eg. +3 pips, drops 6 pips and hovers for 10 min then comes back to the +3 level which is now a new EL...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
So are you modified your strategy? I believe that the "old way" was more safe and the "new way" is more risky.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
sorry I don't clearly understand your question..

--- 帖子 #319 ---
No not a big modify... sometimes still got to go with low/high... it actually more safe..

--- 帖子 #320 ---
long out at BE... here is a defensive play based on various reasons.. - Trigger is stuck at a recent high... i gave it a chance by firstly to take action, but with a tiny tolerance to make the move that I want quick and clean. - German z in within 15 min.. so pre spikes are in store as well.. - I am up two positive trades.. need one or two more to make the DG and got all day to do it.. so taking my time and next probably better opportunity than this one that is messing around. make sense!!..

--- 帖子 #321 ---
So say you enter at #1 EL and PA goes up but not enough to TP. Then PA drops for a while but not enough to stop out the trade. Now there is another EL @ #2. Would you now increase you TP to include the TP level of the #2 trade (if price broke above though hasn't happened in example yet) or would you just be happy to take the #1 trade TP level? Hope makes sense.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
ic thanks for clarification... and a good valid question. the answer is: one trade out of time.. I wait for trade #1 to conclude before doing anything else. so on adding on or changing the tp or add to position.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
watch the current action off the Geman news.. this is why you dont want to be involved to be triggered at the release or have on going trade... 10 minute prior to, I deleted the short pending and some time before that I closed my on going long trade. if i had not done so... i would have been whiplashed like crazy with pending short triggered and long still alive... the kind of positions that you dont want to be in for sure. live example of such news situation.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Yah thanks, was hovering around this assumption, no need to add risk when can clearly bag one full trade. Cheers. ps. Nice eg. of why not to be scalp trading around news. It's something newbies really need to take note of and get in habit of checking news feed at start of day and before opening a trade.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Took action on the same buy EL after news dust had settled... but it just did not move, with already indication of being stuck previous time so I close it for BE.. moving on..

--- 帖子 #326 ---
bastard finally give it upward... it's fine you all can call me the P word now, lol I may have been a bit extra defensive on that one... i just did not like the duration of not much movement it was showing.. which is such cases it will burst one way or other, i did not want to risk that even though the long move was favorable.. oh well. I like more of sure thing..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
All trade today...clear EL and TP ps: i started even @ asian session...i hv test it on past data, its posible to do it(i am do on my own risk since not recomended by the rule)

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I kept mine open (5.5 pips)... easy to do a $30 demo account hehe. My plan is to trade many trades so I can get confident with system.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
This one may fly Edit: careful though at strong resistance though imo.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I'm out 5.8, may continue but as per system not worth risk

--- 帖子 #331 ---
back from lunch... i see this upward move is continuing...

--- 帖子 #332 ---
sound like a good plan.. however matt, i suggest to practice this on a small live account.. like 300 bucks or something and go for micro lot. just a humble suggestion.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
yah, I will be thanks mate I have a few old accounts with between $50 to $240. I plan to try to build one of these accounts up to a point where I care Just shorted @ 1.29487 for +5 (normally like 5.7+ for payment of commission but was looking risky).

--- 帖子 #334 ---
short good for 4 pips.. this is a strong move where it slipped me pretty good at trigger time, about a pip.. I closed it as soon as i saw weakness.. since it has moved so much all in one shot, it could be due for a PB.. so bank now and get on later off the PB sounds like a good plan...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
sounds good Matt.. but here is a prefect example of demo vs real account.. We both traded the same level... what do i get vs you!!.. a different fill.. different result (me 4pips and you 5pips).. i got slipped 1pip... why?.. bcz it's real money, real order that they need to fill. Now on this small TE account of 4k I got slipped 1 pip.. on my large account i got slipped 1.4... why? the size also makes a difference. now this is all normal no way around it and it happens with most if not all brokers/banks... when there is heat triggers will get slipped.. I was even expecting that. all this small little things could throw a plan off and as a trader if not prepared for it... one needs to have plenty of experience of this kind of situation under the belt that has nothing to do with the strategy but plays a big role bcz in the end bottom line is the only thing that matters.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hallo Empire, why did you buy at this level... did i miss an EL? EUR/USD Buy 1.2946

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Yeps fully aware of this cheers mate, your 1 pip of slippage is a perfect example Sorry just re-read what I wrote and noticed I didn't mention the accounts I intend to use are live accounts. I once tried a scalping EA that made a million within 2 years from 10k. The strat was perfect and the trades were legit. The only prob I had when I moved to a live account was the slippage and it failed bad. I still want to use it as it still works... I am tempted to retry since mt4 build 600 introduction as the execution time is decreased.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
+4.5 winner on the last long trade.. this one just required some patience.. I risked holding it for the NY open bcz it had not presented much of threat, nice little bounce earlier from DO, and was at the BE position at the open... grateful it went in my favor. daily target is meet on my 6th trade.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi bachiano Couple of times on that area... once before the German news at 45.. and I gave it shot after the news at 46.. 2nd time I went with its recent close. zoom in on my charts and you should see it clearly..

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Good entry, I screwed mine up and took it off the long wick (10 min ago). Currently -1.1 so still has a chance.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
don't want to sound negative Matt... but EA's simply for various reasons won't work.. I have spend thousand working with some very clever programers to build a EA for me so i did not have to work as much and in the end it did not work... besides of a great system there are many other factors. I had my guys to watch this 24/5 with expensive vps tagged on and etc,.. it simply did not work to my satisfaction.. which i always believed that EA wont work, but as i reach in my upper 30's I did not wanted to work as much so decided to give a chance to a wishful thoughts with slim chance that might work. it did not. Anyhow that's my experience from an expensive and intense work at it.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Nah I'm with you on this one mate. I went through the EA stage about 3-4 years ago and I didn't find one that would trade to expectations. The one I am referring to however had a good strat and if it had a connection like HFT's it may have a chance. I am past that stage however and now only trade manually. Dam demo platform is frozen as I watch my live EU drop hard..... Still open.... Edit: out -5.5 ....I think I'll just switch to a live account from here as they don't freeze like the demo accounts do

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Guys please ignore my last long trade as it was during ppi news where i completely forgot about and took action on it, when it dropped on me so fast i realized.. oopsssss... could have ruined the whole day.. luckily it came back to EL and i close it for -1... my damn news alarm indicator did not go off, which was part of the problem... so got to check that out.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
short trade out for -1.. this had a good chance going to +2 but just couldn't break the DO just yet.. so give it try the next time.. after this ppi and nys open on the edge price is some what yo yo-ing.. as long as you play cold defense.. you can take a crack at a lot of opportunities and walk away Scot-free

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Looks to be a constipated NYS session, lol... Well I got my glass of Cabernet with my EL and PO's placed ready to give the last battle of the day...

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hope ...my defense mode work..... just didn't expect the range was lower then yesterday range ( only 45 pips vs 64 pips). With Great System + Money Management Plan + a little S/R support might be double impact profit if move down will close around -10...and enought for today. This kind of move killing for both scalp buy or short..

--- 帖子 #347 ---
just close it..Thanks God, you are the Gread.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
i hv best learning today...in my previous trade i could add lot size buy or more greed since i hope that moves but i strick to the rule -FIFO ( the point is i will not let my emotion lead my decision).....i hv experiences enough in such conditions... btw, in big picture...this week could be very interesting...price will much trickie around 13000 level. anyhow, my intention is just sharing each other since -not less not more. tq i am out

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I did not expect this bs move... something must have leaked about fed meeting.. anyways it cost me big as one trade got away from me.. unbelievable. great day turned to disaster. see you tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
sam we are not doing the traditional sup/res bullshit in here.. there are plenty of those kind of threads in ff.. stay active there. it seems your not getting it..

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Yah sorry to see this one. It was a surprise announcement that I think caught all off guard. Gona just have to be one of those FX moments to take one the chin and just get back on the horse. Not easy, as I'm well familiar of the wind being taken out of me like a punch in the guts. It's not something I do but know I should- is set an emergency SL, it could be very bad with a black swan event that will happen to us all if we are trading long enough. http://www.forexfactory.com/news.php?do=news&amp;id=504516 ps. Tomorrow I will put up my todays trades though I didn't complete as my live trades needed monitoring / management.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Here's yesterdays trades. My first trade EL could have been better. I also reached the 15pip target (before my loss) which is something I am contemplating when I start this system in earnest.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Morning to all... getting prepared for the day... quick daily brief.. eu as usual bearish and inside a bear box... even with the unexpected 60 pipr upward yesterday did not break outside the box and bounce right back inside.. although price has made small HL's inside the box... I see the DO positioned on semi top of the box.. anyhow, none of these matter when the u.s rate announcement comes out as anything can happen and most likely a sharp move one way or other if they change the rate.. but prior to it I presume it should be same as usual 50-70 pips range if not lower. News wise.. got the GBP bank vote in couple of hours... then u.s cpi early N.Y session.. and of course the big daddy fed stuff... by then we should be done trading hopefully with our DG in da bag and just popping beer out to watch the fed show. I lost a quite bit yesterday do to my own negligence when that unexpected move occurred.. greed played a part a bit as i did not want to give back my days gain.. so i gave that and more on top of it.. it happens rarely but it certainly could have been easily avoided... could be a good lesson for you guys, it can happen to best of us not just newbies. Trade well, Let's rock

--- 帖子 #354 ---
nice job matt

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Cheers mate. I am expecting a climb on the EU today in a Pump-Before-Dump scenario before news. The Fed is supposably going to take a more hawkish outlook which will cause the EU to drop (though most of the move should be already priced in imo). But it's as you say- not important, as it doesn't involve this system and should definitely be out of any trades before any announcements. Got to watch the upcoming pound news too as may cause the EU to move as well.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
good observation..

--- 帖子 #357 ---
first trade long good for +5.. the key for me is to not be after revenge... sticking to the plan.. I will keep eye on sharp moves to get a bit more... but that's always as part of the plan.. warrior type mentality...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
lol, sigh I screwed up my first trade badly. I put a buy limit instead of sell stop and used .1 instead of .01 lots. Newb mistakes happening over here. I am distracted by my real trading but when I start this system on a live account I should have better awareness. I managed to stop it out without a loss . I should re-enter the trade at EL for a "true" result but will prob just skip it.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Guys I want to clarify couple of matters about myself and my method of trading which I have presented here.. basically I don't give a fuck about two elements which of both are so popular amongst all traders/investors. 1- Market sentiments or any kind of bias as to predict market movements. 2- Probability factor... it does not exists.. all trades are at best 50/50 in the long run. You can expect, and if you choose too, learn two elements from me and my method of trading.. 1- Learn to attack and defend at the break of all Earliest Level (EL). 2- Courage and ability to trade all and any market conditions. If this is too out of the box or just simply not your thing... then, this thread would simply not serve you any good. .. just for purpose of clarity.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
couple of trades here playing cat and mouse with price.. sell loss for -10... buy good for +8... i went for a little more than the normal target to get back in BE land.. the damn sell trade FO and never looked back with giving me not even the slightest chance to cut the damage to lower, and I did exactly what i should have done last night.. closed it before the trigger of the buy trade.. that's the way it goes... moving on... gbp news in 20 ... it's wise to not get involve until that release and noise settle..

--- 帖子 #361 ---
last short trade out for -2.. too much messing around the level... seems like not ready to make a bear move atm..

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I was in same trade and I would have got out too but I had internet probs... had to eventually restart my system, out for -6.4. Another reason as I mentioned before to have hard stoploss... nm not too much dmg done. I am back in with the buy.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
last buy out at BE... no explanation just dog shit pa.. sob will run now.. lol

--- 帖子 #364 ---
short good for +5.. this was a nice clean winner.. back to BE for the day.. its been a battle.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Couple recent trades here... pretty much for BE both side.. it's tough market as is expected... Take look at the last red candle.. quick sudden 15 pips move is a example of when market is awaiting a major news... some major player dumping some eu or changing around stops/targets, stuff like that.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks for the trading method, FXEmpire. : ) I only look for the EL that in the same direction as daily direction (from daily open line). I think this way may help improving trading result. ps. sorry for my English. I don't know if I use it correctly or not. ; )

--- 帖子 #367 ---
YW.. I don't agree but your more than welcome to do as you like. best of luck.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Friggin internet is dead. My phone lines have died. The phone company are going to research tomorrow (11:15 pm here). But as a smart trader I have a back up IP on a wireless USB, though had to buy some pre-paid and my connection is a little slower too but at least I'm not dead in the water . Needless to say that I didn't finish todays testing. I was about B.E. with 5 trades before shite hit the fan. Empire don't be disheartened by this weeks results, it is a difficult week imo with much news and uncertainty in the air. Tomorrow may not be a great day for trading this strat as well with Scottish votes. Also I have found in the past, trying to post trades and trade at the same time can be off-putting. Don't let this forum distract you from your true goal. That said, as I'm sure your aware, we are all grateful to you for sharing your strategy and T.E.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I appreciate your kind words Matt.. Believe it or not even in this tough market I can make money and I have done so... the losses are all due to my own negligence... both yesterday and today I allowed myself to be on trades from both side, which is a big no no for what i do... so high confidence is back firing and too aggressive for my own good. Gotta admit that stupid loss yesterday is kinda effecting me today. i am a honest straight forward guy.. so i mention when i screw up. however it's all good... i am fine.. the posting does not effects me as it keeps me busy to talk trades and interact between trades. Will bounce back without a doubt just gotta go back to the patience game. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Good to hear mate and your very welcome I plan to start using a small live micro account next week for testing and will throw it up on a T.E. if I do. I used this week to get my head around the strat and to slowly work it into my management scheme (failed at times lol). I now have my screens/platforms setup so I can keep an eye on both. The thing I like about scalping strats like this is even though the market changes continuously these types of methods keep true.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Just want to thank you the market clock...I was looking for something for a while, and the one in your OP is just perfect for this job! Else: Matt said: "Friggin internet is dead. My phone lines have died. The phone company are going to research tomorrow (11:15 pm here). But as a smart trader I have a back up IP on a wireless USB, though had to buy some pre-paid and my connection is a little slower too but at least I'm not dead in the water ." 100% right on the spot!! A back up internet connection is a MUST!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
very true.. I wish you luck and good skill once you start that account.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Good morning to all.. Getting prepared for today's trading where there is all kinds of news with Scottish vote going on all day... so we are in for sudden unexpected whipper moves, lol.. Fed news is behind us as it worked in the favor of the dollar, Dow closed all time high as it serves a physiological effect overall, so again good for dollar I presume. I took lil advantage on that bear move with a small short trade going on at it inside +100 pips profit as of now, so happy about that little note after the dismal week that I been having. The main trend on EU is bearish strongly now, popping out of the week long bear box with another leg down. We got to play solid but safe today.. Trade well. Let's rock...

--- 帖子 #374 ---
just something fun while waiting for setup to form... This is my short off the fed news... after the major reaction appeared to be bearish.. i decided to take a shot at short off the pullback for 1/6th of normal lot size... it worked and I will let it run for a while bcz it's within trend and risk free for me. I am having a bad week otherwise I would have gone in half lot on it.. it looked too good to not take shot at.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
1st trade long out for -2.. right before it shoot up to target.. jinxed me out of winner.. That immediate bold bear candle FO put me on the defensive mood right away... so on first resume chance to around BE point I out it... amazingly enough the candle that i exited was fucking around the whole time till the last minutes of it... but took off bull in the end.. so a bit frustrating when this kind of things happens and could throw one off... but the key is to move on and stay intact to the plan and avoid doing crazy things... I will try, lol.,as this disgusting week is continuing. those of you who might be a religiously follower should understand how valuable this insight that i am giving out truly is. anyways moving on...

--- 帖子 #376 ---
short good or +5... i put the PO back in place after I saw the news took a sharp FO move, it looked to drop big.. anyhow good for the target. this could open a series of short trades for now till NY open...

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hypothetically the DG is meet by what has occurred so far.. three possible signals all winners, two of them clean winners. by looking at my last chart its clearly visible.. (blue lines are EL's that has triggered and yellow are the ones that has not and are void) I got jinxed out of one... second one I was having lunch... 3rd one banked full target...

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Thanks for beeing honest. This is the only thing that matters in trading. Better to learn when you see what can happen than everything going well all rhe time. Good to see real traders sharing . Looking forward to see more.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Lunch?? no time for lunch, this forex is a serious business .. haha, well done, again the system looks good. Not trading it today, too many things going on as I've being organising my internet connection repairs, plus managing open positions. Be back tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
yep, money never sleeps, lol... get that internet con going and start kicking ass next week.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
just a bit review on PA : range around 70 pips so far (will play inside range or outside) there is two red news in minutes. rejected to move higher @128999 but not follow through sell down heavily. level PA : 12850 and 12835 for sellers , see what PA doing there.... 12890 and 12900 for buyers i am on defense mode @ 12890 buy(1 entry)...in defense mode, i might close, hegde or open opposide direction depend on what will happen next. the only goal is loss &lt; gain.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
here is the pic...if break 12910...will be surprise for buyers

--- 帖子 #383 ---
My last couple of trades... the long made immediate FO had me kinda deep but luckily it came back for BE exit.. the short trade was a clean quick winner.

Morning to all.. Late start for me here to get the morning brief out... but just in time to take advantage of the 1st opportunity where it turn as a winner, I post the chart after this post. yesterdays action was mostly bullish almost diminished all the bear move of the fed news.. so we not much on tab today news wise and the Scottish vote being done and over with price could spend 50-70 range at least for today and hints for forming a bear box. The DO is up on top of yesterdays bull move and I would expect for the price to travel bear today mostly.. but who the heck knows. news wise as I mentioned we got nothing important maybe post reaction of the Scottish vote could move the market. Trade well... Let's rock

--- 帖子 #387 ---
short good for +5... and as you there was a follow up signal also for a winner.. i missed that one..

--- 帖子 #388 ---
5 pips

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I held on a bit longer to this one

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Couple of trades here... first short quick FO but took the chance and held it for a resume which it and I closed it for +2, could have hold it for a lot more, but stuck to the plan to exit trade that had cause trouble and at the Break even point it did struggle a bit.. the second short trade up top was a QC (Quick Clean) winner.. I love those. again DG is meet with couple of hours inside EU session.. I however missed one trade so am at +10..

--- 帖子 #391 ---
short trade here banked +3... it was messing around way too much at the +3 mark, sensed PB coming.. so better to bank it than let it go into loss and getting involve in survival battle.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
here it is.. the last bull candle... this is what i tried to avoid being involved with... sense and feel ability... when your focused and zoomed in one pair... you would eventually get a grip at it for most part. This could drop right back down and even run to the basement.. which I personally think highly that it will drop back down.. but all that is just besides the point.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
here it is.. the drop back... but who knew it could have not drop so immediately on the very candle.. could have take much longer and getting you deeper in loss before dropping back... and it could have not even ever again drop back, lol... we go after sure things... there will enough of share of immediate FO's that have deal with.. its better to not add to that much.. the deal is to getting more familiar and form this sense and feel to spot the heat coming against your position just a touch earlier than it actually does to play accordingly.... this will keep you safe to play at any condition any time any where of the chart and walk away scot free most times with some change in your pocket on consistent basis. This small series of post for you to learn and absorb the real content of this threads purpose.

Friday's day end chart.. This would consider as a perfect day for what I do and the method.. DG was meet within couple of hours inside the EU session.. but continued on with QC winners one after another off the bear move... but even when pulled back for long signal, still provided nice QC's.. i got my DG after 4 trades with the 3rd trade giving a bit of hell but i high strong for bear move on friday so it worked out, could have caused trouble though.. I also had a pretty good position on the fed short trade i had made on Wednesday which still running.. my plan with that trade is to gain enough profit to wipe the one large loss trade I had this week, hopefully it gets there as the chances are looking good for it to do so, it's risk free trade anyways at +110 for now. I can elaborate more about such days the pros and cons of it... but since it seems not much interests going on in here it would be pointless maybe.. and I expect the low interest since this my method is odd and fully manual which required craft and skill to be patience about to develop and very many out to do that.. anyways enjoy the weekend bcz that's what i am doing.. beers, music and girls in bikini sound about right to me

Well done FXemp. Enjoy your weekend.

Morning to all... I hope you had a enjoyable weekend and refreshed for this weeks trading, much success to everyone. Daily brief... The main trend on EU is still standing Bearish, nothing new there as every important major news has eventually drove in favor of dollar as the very same stood for Thursdays fed rate decision to not change the interest rate till mid next year at least... so all in all it's safe to say dollar is strong in long term view where in the last week or so has shown some sign of slow downs that counts for nothing but just a small PB as a continuation of the strong standing bear move. However in the short view this small PB or hesitation could be interpreted to a Bear box as i like to call it where it was slightly broken when fed news came out but not strongly freeing up from it, so to concluded, with not much on tab news wise for this week we may see some more up and down move in the same but wider bear box, or, the big major players would come in at large and make the real moves based on what they heard from Yellen last week... who knows, but these are the kind of things that could be expected so when it does happen we could right of the bat know whats driving it why and to not get cut all of guard. for me... all of this goes to back of my mind and the focus goes to my trading plan where the core of it is to defend the slightest threat coming against my position before my target and to stay safe protective at all times. I see the DO in the bottom of the recent action and Asian session has pulled bullish a good 50 pips from it... if I wanted to have a predetermined idea about direction of the day I would be leaning more bearish for the Eu session and not to expect much but maybe some more bullish move... but who knows. news wise... fairway is open for the next 8hrs till Dragi speech around NYS open. with all that said it only serves a self awareness for back of the mind and what comes to front should be the daily plan to follow the prices and play accordingly by spotting one EL after another to snag QCW's, or at least that's what we do here in this thread. As long as skillful enough to defend well with discipline and strength.. then it really don't matter to predict directions, conditions. or all kinds of fancy analysis etc,... I prefer to dance my way into a humble daily goal. Keep it simple, trade like a force... Good skill... let's rock...

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thank you... hope you did the same.

Hiyas. I was late in on the first trade of the week (short). I entered at the level behind the current, but like the level for a further drop. I am on a live account now and if I win I will post in TE... hehe kiddin I will post it regardless, when I get time. I prob wont post trade-by-trade as I am also managing other positions. GL all.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I wish you best of luck and more importantly good skill with your new live account.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Thx mate. I'm in defence to start with, out with -4 (London open approaching). Would have been B.E. had I followed the system.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
couple of trades... 1st one long -1.5, spotted the quick FO so closed it right away... 2nd trade short off an aggressive EL with some patience good for +4.. which looked good off the break down to +3 pips then turned, I decided to stay with to see what londi would do, which turned bear on a rather strong resume, so I stayed with it till first hesitation... all in all not a clean move and play but some time experience will serve well..

--- 帖子 #410 ---
ok guys I am going to give you guys some rocks... look at the chart of prices recent movement and see what you make out of it... you will see that since mid Asian session up to now price has formed a small 10 piper box with multiple touch on top side and three chop kind of touched on the bottom side... when spotting such situation the chances are when taking shot at this levels you would get faked out mostly and quick bounce to the other side and there it goes until it breaks one way or other which we are not sure which way it will break and pretty much clueless as to When... so based on what we do here we take shots at these EL's regardless, but with much much extra care... exactly the same aggressive defensive play I made on my 1st long trade... so the point i want to hit home here is.. spot the condition.. then see if you have to play extra defensive or softer etc,... but regardless you would want to take a shot instead of sitting on the side line... bcz that's the worst thing you can do... you might say I would wait for it break out of this zone and take a shot then... well most of the time when price breaks out of this type of situations it runs for while without even making a hesitations at times.. so you be left off with out a winning trade.. the better play is to take shot and defend.. and after some wins survives of such under your belt measure you confidence and ability... it just might do wonders.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
here is the break out of the box as QCW, well referring to the words in the above post. I however, took a shot and played it way to aggressive closing for -1... but i was there for the grab, played it safe and most likely if it had not messed around way too much in early stages I would have banked the target if not more.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Gah. Holding this one so far, even though I knew it was going to bounce due to the hit of 5m 200ema and also same hit on GU. UJ may of made a st top too... not sure where my line of "hope" vs "strat" is. Will watch for a bit longer then may shut this trade down. Edit: The monthly 23.6 fibo is at 1.2858 for resistance though.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
last trade short good for target.. took some patience..

--- 帖子 #414 ---
A happy start to my TE, though as we all know 1 days stats means squat. I will be happy if after a couple of weeks it is still looking good.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I will prob be sitting sidelines for first hour of London today due to news releases.

why you're angry with me? i only offer you help if u want. you dont have respect and are a bad trader.... numbnuts!!!! with this rythm, u will lost the account in a month. go to hell

--- 帖子 #420 ---
aha who is being disrespectful and angry now... I got no reason to be angry, lol I just simply asked you what makes you think I need help.. tell me and we'll take it from there, ok sonny...

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I always find it so amusing when some members come in only to flap their mouth with sarcasms idiotic comments while they hardly ever have anything positive or useful to offer nor ever have made any effort to contribute to the forum and always with out a doubt they fold when asked to prove anything about their trading much as less real proven results because their always opt to judge others but with nothing to show of their own... funny stuff. I personally don't have respect nor patience for this kind of members.. so I just give them the dog shit replies, lol.. or call'em the most suitable names. just a clarification purposes for the sake of respectful members to not get the wrong impression about me. I keep it real folks... the reason for any trading success that I ever have had has been solely due to my self-honesty about my trading... and if you have been a true follower of this thread so far you have witnessed that to the mass.. as I explain every little detail about my trades right after I am done with it... all for your sake of better understanding to avoid traps etc,.. bcz I know how one or two in accurate play could ruin a wonderful day. I don't see much interest here lately so I spend less time posting for last 48hrs, also got some minor construction going on in my house as I been managing everything out of my office with one lapy to watch over four accounts... anyhow if anyone is interested and cares enough to know about that one big loss trade of today be more than happy to elaborate on. The bottom line and whats really important in here, is the content of this thread... the value of whats been offered and could continue to be offered.. and what you as a trader of your own could take away from and add it to your trading arsenal... results will vary from one to another and highly depends on ones crafted skill and agendas... eg, today i am losing 10%, but our own very dear member MattMico is wining 5-7% and having a great week so far which i congrats him and would love to see him continue on the same.. it would be just matter of time for my TE account to grow.. but again, it's just irrelevant and not the point... sure it maybe a confidence booster, but that's about it. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Sigh that last trade.... It made no sense to me, I had reversal patterns on all my pairs I was watching but still the USD came through n fked me. Such a hard day to trade today, feels like bs imo that the markets went up to come down again, there wasn't any reason aside from stop hunting. nm, just another day trading. Thanks for words Empire, though I fked up today and also had a hard day on my real account, made some dollars but am red in a few trades atm. Not sure what tnavi was on about but it seemed a bit from "left field". The long stops are the killer on this system and I will need to watch to not let them run. I let the last run because I saw a strong level of support but it broke without a pullback. Just another day trading back at it tomorrow. Laters

--- 帖子 #423 ---
dear MattMicro.. If I may humbly give you take on your trading today after my review of your TE... The key to winning with this system is obviously based on how good one defends... how fast you can bail out of losers... the other key point is to not have any kind of a bias on price direction or anything at all for that matter... floating away with it, that's it. back to defense.. and i understand, that on the flip side you could end up bailing out of some trades a bit prematurely that turns for a solid winner.. however with that said... still in the long run the winning play is the aggressive defense, simply bcz in a week time there will be enough of those QCW's to make one's bottom line to grow rather rapidly.. but the point i want to hit home for you is this... when your up for the day for +20 pips... then either you stop trading for that day or if you continuing on.. the aggressive defensive play is a MUST without question... meaning zero tolerance for any heat against your position and only looking for QCW fast.. this is how you could preserve what you have gained for the day while still giveing yourself the chance to add to it. I know your trading a very small account and testing things out but i though this would be something to think about and put on practice day in day out. again just a humble take and hope it helps out. ps) just saw your post... so added some elements... also check my TE and review my very same trades defensive plays on the two big losses you took.. now the winners that you had today... all were QC (quick Clean) fast winners... try to look for those and anything less than that, (especially when your ahead in the day) exit it fast for a small loss.. hence i said small loss not BE.. bcz waiting for BE all the time will lead to back fire.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hehe yah I agree with your thoughts Empire as they echo my own. I am thinking (if) when I start this system in full force of aiming for 20 pips per day, though it does take awhile for that many trades in one day. I took that last trade even though that voice said in the back of my mind "your profits are achieved". I am pushing the system atm I suppose and watching what I can and can't get away with. I do like the idea of playing the defence more aggressively (if that makes sense ) as it is not only easier to recover from the loss but also I have noticed that another opportunity to trade the system presents itself in the correct direction, whereas if I were still holding the losing trade the opportunity will be missed. A good example is on my last trade (will post chart tomorrow). I actually screwed up one of my earlier entries today, where I traded a very shallow pullback, one I would have normally skipped for a better setup. Luckily after a about a 10 pip DD the trade came back up for a good setup and then finished my trade for a tp. It was a very tough day for me on my other system. I have a strict MM/RR system but it requires a bit of calculation and I had trades coming and going all day so I couldn't spend as much time on this system as I wanted.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Here are my trades from today. The dotted lines are where I am thinking that I should of cut of those losing trades (at the most), especially the 2nd and 3rd losses. Trade number three was a bit early for my liking though it worked out to be a setup anyway- luckily.

first target out of the way, long good for +5... demolition intention on the way for today

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Wd Was watching that entry but was busy, going to get started now.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
right on, lets kick some a** today Matts man.. np you'll get the next one..

484 EL for short and 636 EL for long...

--- 帖子 #433 ---
EL's changes to 567 long and short the same 484

--- 帖子 #434 ---
484 short triggered and i bailed for +1... don't like how it pulled back off the DO... could have had +3 but pulled quickly.. so better to be safe and preserve.. there is two major areas that I take the threat against my position more seriously.. one at the trigger time.. two when it rushes to some profit like +3 +4 then quickly fades away... rush &amp; fade is what i call it (RF) so RF was the reason for my exit.. obviously it could move down but as you see it's struggling and the problem with this situation is, once it releases from this hesitation period its usually a quick strike one way or other... and mostly will happen against your position.. so better to not risk it. to win big and consistently you atta try to be one step ahead of the market..

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Dam pound wont let the this trade go.....

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Gah, the Pound supported the Euro for too long and lost the move I could see. It will prob still go but hoping there will be another EL before it does.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
ok target reached on this play after 30 min... not exactly a fifo... and at best this is a 50/50 play.. if it had pulled right at where i exited and head up for -5 or more I would have found myself in a unnecessary dog fight and if exited for some loss then been sitting on at a BE result at best for day after 2 trades... now I did not get this target but sitting at +6.. and still a whole day ahead of me for more opportunities... at least another 5 signals to take action on.. these are some of the daily Management aspects to always keep in mind in the heat of the battle...

--- 帖子 #438 ---
now moving on... new EL's, short 412.. and long as of now still the old one 567.. but i would be a bit hesitant to take action on that one if it strikes up to that point in a sudden move bcz its far away and for the scope of today's atr by time it reaches that level it could be exhausted already would get us involved in a fake out battle.. so I look for a new EL off down lower, which most likely one would be formed. now about the short EL at 412... as you know I do not pay attention to anything but price movement bcz I take a shot at anywhere in the chart during my trading session... but its important to keep some matters in the back of your mind to come handy in the case of crisis... such as... well 412 EL is sitting right at days low which has showed 3 touch so far to that area and had bounced... so when and if you do get triggered at that area the correct defensive play is and extremely aggressive one.. meaning you looking for strong break off the level,, crush of the support area and a QCW.. anteing less than that or any threat what so ever you MUST press the out push button to not fall into a dog fight and possibly a big loss if your mental state gets all roughed up.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
EL update.. short stays the same at 412.. but new one for long at 500..

--- 帖子 #440 ---
short EL 423 out for -1.. just like explained above.. that's how i played it.. the break looked kinda good but then hesitated and following candle a reverse.. tough area..

--- 帖子 #441 ---
sob broke lose finally... it just did not do it when I want it at the trigger... a bit frustrating but it's the correct play.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Can't have em all and the current trade looks like a revenge trade Stick to your plan, it's a good plan. I trade my own profit/loss on correlations / TA. Even though you missed the main move last trade you kept safe for a safe system. Anyway price should be heading your way soon imo.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
short 322 EL out at BE... It broke so nicely but can't believe how fast it engulfed the whole way.. anyhow exited on the first resume chance..

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Out too. This could turn into a nice move down but there maybe a spike up yet imo.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Short EL at 271 banked +2.5... wasn't about to let this one to getaway too..

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I am not sure what you mean by revenge play, I am far from that.. took a valid signal.. it got me in a dog fight with a quick upward move with no chance for me to make a profitable play on it and end up making the motion-less exit play on the first chance. anyhow thanks for the heads up.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
yep could've, should've not good enough for us here... the evident spike personify it.. as you pre called it. long EL at 358..

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Going to have to automate the next set which I hate to do cos I have to leave comp. Will be with tight settings... GL.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
this is a perfect QCW.. short 250 EL good for +5..

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Back. Happy with the 3.5 TS with nearly 9 pips win.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
well done so far today matt... like the exit on previous trade off 271 EL... good stuff.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Cheers Empire It's good today actually cos I can spend a little more time with the system as most of my main acc. trades are positioned from yesterday. So far the system is holding up really well. If this hits one of those trending seasons there could be a lot of money here. Atm the market is quite volatile and sometimes without purpose, has been for past 18 months or so imo. Even so the system holds up, like I've said earlier this type of method holds up in most conditions. Still more testing and practice is needed though and it also pays to have good knowledge of what's happening on the charts.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I don't know how many people are true followers here or following at all... but anyhow I want to hit home something important make today as a example and that is the importance of not having a bias or any kind of prediction for the days movement.. as you see.. today sure looked like it was going to be a bullish day for EU which I/we capitalized with one buy win.. but look at the it now.. how it has turned into a bearish day now... if one had a set stone on buy... either would have had missed on profits or worse if had held on to a long trade now would in deep trouble.. so the best thing is to free flow... main asset of this methodology... hard for most if not all to swallow, i know.. but it's key to your success, at least in here. so when you all see a member comes in and talks all this fancy pansy analysis s/r pivot and junk indies and i either harsh or put then off.. that is the reason.. bcz it does not bring any advantages to the game what so ever. today's real results is the proof of it and the results that you will see in the feature.. so i don't preach for the sake of preaching.. it's transparent.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
matt... this is not a system... if any.. that would be YOU.. systems fail under different conditions... but YOU would not bcz of the craft and skill that you possess that can head on with any type of market condition and still to pull out your 15-20 pips consistently each and every day.. it just needs a acceptable strong mind to begin with and action, the work ethic to execute stone cold. The engraved mentality and defense is the asset. It's priceless. I don't trade any other way since moons ago Cheers,

don't trade that... simple commonsense... it's after a very strong long move due for exhaustion.. price at full daily atr... not to mention on the edge of u.s red news..

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Yh, I was going to kill it fast if it went against me due to the hard trend. My trip away from the comp broke my concentration for a sec there I think.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Thank you for sharing such good info,l see there is an ema on your chart,what is the value and do you use it to see the current trend?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
YW.. The value is 40... not so much for trend but some kind of quick guide of where price is for the day.. I don't put much weight on it like if price is above or below it I should do this or that.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Here are my trades for the day. The last trade was unnecessary and prob not a great level to trade due to the distance it took to get there without a pullback. Also could of exited faster as I saw UJ spiking hard, still living on a bit of hope that I need stomp on . Again achieved my goal for the day of 20 pips before my loss. I am still pushing on the boundaries of this system to get to know it better and to work out what I can and can't get away with. Anyhow, day 3 and another thumbs up

--- 帖子 #463 ---
A bit late but a quick 5

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Morning.. a bit of a late start for me.. missed the first QCW but in time for the second trade short at 526 EL good for +5 qcw.. nice job matt and matlobien..

--- 帖子 #465 ---
wd, It was a good opportunity that we all spotted and did gud off, system +1.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Careful Draghi speaking (unscheduled)

--- 帖子 #467 ---
matlo what happen there.. did you get slipped there with the late entry or ...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
hopefully whatever he is saying will trend bear today for quick banks on hiccups.. new EL formed already at 366..

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Defended, out at be +comm., moving too slow.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
bailed out for +1 at the short 366 EL trade.... initial break was weak... so on the resume i wanted a straight strong move to the target or out at no damage..

--- 帖子 #471 ---
heh, it's gona burst on us now, nm next time it could do opposite.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
exactly.. just ignore what it does afterward.. as you see the move was weak it barely maybe made the target.. we spotted early and made the correct play. that mind frame is key..

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Yah, I've also found with this system it's always good to remember that there's another opportunity around the corner- 'no rush'.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Easy pips today.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
nice job kouen to be there for it..

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Was too busy with my main acc., would have closed my short at B.E. with the break of UJ. Saw it from the corner of my eye but had too much to do with my real money. If UJ starts a pullback to BO point I will close long.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I am saddened to see that short hovering there Empire mate, it sux when that happens and have been there on many occasion. Atm PA is sitting very close to the 200ma (though hasn't touched yet) but when it touch's it may either pullback or fly and I'm pretty sure it's not going to pullback to the open level, I'm guessing it will fly. Need to be strong, atm it's only around 7*trades behind but if PA takes a leap which could potentially happen it may fly 50-100 pips. Be real careful mate. PS. pls follow your own strategy though... I don't want to influence you away from a plan.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Back on the horse mate

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I'm hating myself right now for saying something. If PA had of gone in other direction though, you acc. could have been history. There are a few reasons why I think tonight's (Aus) move has changed the game but wont go into here. I should prob leave the thread after this. I'm sorry mate.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
where you going matt!!!... don't worry about it bro, lol it's just a 50pips loss.. shit happens.. i was too distracted to be trading today anyways, that's all... i cut loser faster than bullet can fly. don't feel bad at all, come back bud, lol.. your doing great and that's all it matters, 12% gain that is fking awesome, we should celebrate it and be happy that there will be more and more such days... my TE is a devotion to this thread. I can turn it around at will.. no worries.. just gotta be intact with it.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Thank you mate! I have always avoided commenting on peoples positions in the past to not influence them in any way as the market can be a real biach. I have being staring at the market tonight with the possibility of a few trend changes and then saw your position and didn't want to see the account disappear. I think I am a bit over tired which is why I let my discipline slip on not commenting on ppl's positions. Anyway, thank you for your words and I'm sure your TE will pick itself up, especially with this system as I can honestly say, is the most reliable system so far I have seen. Thanks again mate, for sharing the system and for just being a good bloke

--- 帖子 #482 ---
np brother... to be honest I did not even see your post and nor anyone's comments would ever effect my trading decisions, with all due respect, that's just the way i am.. and any solid experience trader would tell you the same or should do the same.. trading is all independent in the end. so no worries at all. but for the record on this trade.. after it burst up for 30 then made some slow downs and i was just waiting to see if it's going to pullback a bit so I could get out of with smaller loss.. and on other side if it made another leg up to measure it's strength and get out if too strong.. and the damn thing look too strong for a quick solid 20 pips candle.. so at this point i got to push the button, which i did and i am glad for it... its only a two days worth of solid work to get it back.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
dow is getting hammered today.. overall red u.s market..

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Yah, it was a market mover. I was on Gold/Silver at the time with about 160 near vertical pip movement (Gold). I think today has been a bit of game changer for further analysis. I didn't imagine that anything I said would influence your trading plan, but it was just the timing of it all. Like you say, it shouldn't take you long to get those pips back, especially with this system. I'm pushing the system again and looking negative on this trade so far, though letting it run a little. This seems to be trend (if it ends up being a loss), this time of day with London gone to bed the system seems to struggle a bit. Need more trades to confirm this yet though. Ah.. nm my fault, the 200ma (the only ma I use as it is used by many traders) is sitting right on my EL, shouldn't have entered.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
surely so.. should not trade post overlap time.. London to London.. i am on this one too..

--- 帖子 #486 ---
I'm out with -9. I think I need some Zzz's, it's been a hard week on my main account but it's also being rewarding. It's been one of those weeks that everything has worked for me and am doing well and this system is like the cherry on top. With just over 30 trades it is starting to prove itself. I am looking forward to getting a few hundred under the belt to really get it working. Just looking at this move, if I had of played defensive as I should of, I could have entered in opposite direction with another EL and made up for the lost pips. Very cool system. Learning, learning

--- 帖子 #487 ---
take it easy bud...

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thnx mate, you too. Here's day #4 trades if any interested. Cyas.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thought I'd try some Asian session setups as I saw enough volatility in the PA. Ofc once I started it dried up and I got stuck in a range with continued fakeouts. I think I could almost make it work even in that atmosphere with a change of tactics of the attack/defend, but at the end of the day it is prob too slow and not worth the effort. I have a bit of catching up to do now when London kicks in. There doesn't seem to be much news about today and as long as there is a bit of volatility about, it should be a good day for the system.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Morning... first trade short at 398 El good for +7.4 qcw

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Dear matt... there are two kinds of range market... one, lifeless range which is range where there hardly any life in it within that range... two, volatile range within expand of that range, which quick burst from one side to other side happens off our early entry levels. it's safe to say that the lifeless range is the only condition that would harm this method. If one trades the Asian session should reco the range type and then play accordingly for better success. how one can spot it... one, by watching the speed and rhythm of the movement inside that range... two, to not trade the periods or sessions that are more than likely are lifeless,, such as Sydney, Asian and 2nd half of NYS. I hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Yah that's good thanks mate. The prob was it started with a wide range but afterwards collapsed into a tight range and refused to budge except for multiple FO's. It wasn't important really, I was just playing with the system to get to know it better as I've being doing for the last week or so. I think maybe next week I may start getting into serious mood for profit pips per day and keeping to plan. Edit: Consolidation was the word I think I was searching for, knew it didn't sound right...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
sounds like a great plan... the important part is the daily management to be played accordingly such as the positions that one is at what period of the day W/L.. for eg, like yourself yesterday.. when up +12% about +30 pips... either to not trade or drop the load to 5 times lower or play super aggressive defense, etc.. these are the thing that you would not do in early part of the day before reaching the 15/20pip DG (with exception of playing good D at all times)... you know all this and on your way to do really good..

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Yup thinking along these lines too and once above daily quoter (if kept going) only risk DD down to the DQ. I'm in long atm and at the face of it it looked a bit risky coming into resistance but was also looking at UJ and the 30m pin bar on EU.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
talk about fking up a prefect signal for easy 10, lol.. watch the chart and see what I did wrong and why i exited.. it would be a good lesson for you all, as how much small little details makes huge difference.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
A bit early

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Lol oops. It's not a bad response with the EL messup. Could have turned at that moment to put you in the red, was a good recovery.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
yep a bit early as you pointed out.. but way better than my invalid late entry, lol.. watch my chart... the correct EL was the one from previous bump just about a pip higher... good job anyhow to be there to capitalize.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
i can not believe this mistake... the yellow line is a void... which as soon as i see a new one I change the line color from blue to yellow and tag the new fresh earliest EL... in this case I did not and i had the EL off the wick for a trade that did not happen (the appropriate EL for that time) mid franky open... so when it dropped for a good amount and sell trade... i should have quickly voided the wick EL and tage the new one off the same pump but at the close candle... as you all see how important that little early entry is... +5 was reached within minute or two before the slight bounce off the DO. I exited... bcz i was disgusted from my mistake and the worst thing one can do is to lose on a invalid signal especially when you feel disgusted, lol... but i kept it just tad to see if it passes through the DO but it bounce (which does not much show in the candle now, but it did and was red for minute or two). anyways... attention to details...

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Yah these things happens, I'm sure happens even to "big" guys out there (a few fat fingers have been seen). Plenty of opportunities today by looks of so don't stress too much

--- 帖子 #501 ---
short at 452 EL out for -2... bastard had me in deep fo.. so first resume outttt..

--- 帖子 #502 ---
second try at this jerkoff short El abit lower at 429.. out for -2..

--- 帖子 #503 ---
long EL at 511 out at -2... the break looked good so i gave it some time to show it's true color.. it's just not giving out for the last hour... so all you can do is to not giving in to it too much and play defense... if it continues as such, surviving for break even or small total loss considers an achievement. look to be a great day but turned into a dog shit dog fight...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Still in, letting run a bit deeper as I think it will come back..... much more and going to have to shut it off.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
May have screwed me this time. Took the loss deep then it triggered my short and is now on way back up.... I'm a little distracted atm which doesn't help.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Going to automate the next round, I need to sort some shite out.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
my short was not trigger, but came very close.. do use buffer of .3-.4? anyhow that's what one should and never put the the PO right at the level price.. for others to take note as a clear clarification.. The EL should be drawn right at the either Low or High or Close price whichever one you choose for that particular EL.. and the from that EL price use a buffer of 3 or 4 tenth of a pip.. buy EL 1.27210.. .4 buffer = 1.2721 4

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Yah around .4 for shorts and about .8 for longs (for spreads ).

--- 帖子 #509 ---
I may call it a night after this trade. The U.S. session will prob bring more volatility but I have the next door neighbour handing me a beer and the missus nagging me (I have to put a smiley there in case she looks over my shoulder). My results today were the fault of the user of the system not the system itself. Week one of testing very positive and already looking forward to week two.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
short EL at 412 good for +6... there wasn't a move that it didn't display on this damn trade, lol...

--- 帖子 #511 ---
LOL.. take her out on a nice expensive dinner, it's on me. right on brother.. enjoy your weekend..

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Lol don't write that in case she looks over the shoulder again and reads it... there would be no escape after that . If this system continues to hold with the test of time, as I suspect it might, I will be buying more than dinner however and will have to send you a gift for the introduction, thanks sharing it and your time explaining it.... Don't want to move now that PA is beginning to move but people to do and places to be... talk next week, have a good w.e. p.s. bugger, I knew PA was going to do that after the consolidation, nm.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
last short off 282 EL... had me faked out right after trigger... out for almost -5 right before the news for obvious reasons... also removed the buy PO... another good example of not being involved in news time... whiplashing the heck out .. almost every trigger has formed a major challenge...

--- 帖子 #514 ---
short 130 EL food for +6... it looks easy in the hindsight but it wasn't as it has been all day... all kind of damn moves when your zoomed in at to play defense and at the same time not exit prematurely..

--- 帖子 #515 ---
go home to your wife matt, lol you just can't leave early don't you

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Lol, she's not my wife and I think I better switch off my screen before she see's that and gets any ideas. I am sneaking in trades while ppl are busy and even sneaked one on my ipad lol (why I screwed up lot size). I have to keep an eye on my main acc trades to be sure don't get out of control. Others are busy and haven't missed me too much I think.

Just out of curiosity you describe yourself as a full time trader. Do you find 21.7% loss for the week acceptable? I'm not being funny just interested we all have our own ways.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
How many account have I busted or not is irrelevant. My contribution to the forum, transparency and real content of this thread is evident to a logical realistic person/trader. My TE's mostly have served as a devotion to my threads and testing out with real money on the line for other system method... some of us fortunately in life have the luxury to do that kind of things, you know.. and it wont even put a dent into the wealth. Overall, from a few TE's i have posted here at ff all comes to breakeven in the end.. so i don't know what you knuckle heads are talking about.. the +6k almost wipes the loses and far exceeds what any of you piker can ever come up with in your whole life, lol. but the question is.. can you be truthful about, that you "can trade".. any real proof beside empty words?.. I don't think so, lol .. 4000 post of worth of bullshit is what you got billy piker. so.. then judging someone else's real results regardless or W/L is just stupid especially coming from a phony like you, and amusing which gives any real person or trader a good laugh. but hey, you can be a fuck happy fking fellow all you want, after all thats what most do in FF, so knock yourself out as being just an another one, lol..

Morning folks.. getting ready to start the week out. I hope you enjoyed your weekend as much as I did.. after all our rewards past the grueling week long of trading is the two day getaway, to enjoy it in fullest to be refreshed for the week ahead. .. franky open in 15min and Londi on the way.. it's Monday morning it's wise to be with extra care, this is the week of NFP and MPC, so market could be awaiting for those releases... who knows.. just being alert... not much on tab for today news wise, just the German cpi half hour into londi open, so be aware of that. I wish everyone a rain down of greens upon your accounts. I got my game face on... you!!,,, lol Let's rock..

first one out of the way.. long 720 EL +5..

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hey. Wd, was watching that but didn't get a position in on time. I took a couple of trades on Frinight on the ipad (hence the strange .2 lot trade). I prob shouldn't have but did it as the market was moving so had to watch my main positions. I am going to try trading the system with discipline this week. My main trading of the system has been well enough (imo) but I will stop trading out of trading zone times and will try aiming for a pip profit per day though I am still leave this rule slightly flexible pending results.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
well, you got used to catching those double digits winnas last week, lol.. based on my observation. anyhow, its not a problem bud.... the best thing to do in order to find a balance with this, meaning not losing out on +5 while you look for more... is to, to only leave slight door open for anything beyond +5... any slightest hesitation at +5 you job is to bank and preserve.. at +7 same.. at +10 same... so basically your only on it till it serves the first slightest hesitation.... catching anything above +5 is just bonus and considered as being lucky.. anyways this should be the mind set..

yah agree. I norm aim for 5.7 if I think is possible, to cover comm. and was think 7 that trade which it hit. I just looked away and got distracted for a moment. Good thing it was myself that screwed up but the system proved itself again, which is the important part.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Didn't want that short? I jumped out of mine on the inverted hammer and missed the move, not disappointed though.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
thats good... it's not a problem you'll get the next one... I also go for +6... which after commission comes to +5 give or take... to be exact is 5.3.. there was a short EL 839... I passed on... sometimes i ignore EL's that go straight up and down or vise versa.. but this one was a winner.. a bit of daily management there to as i am up +3 winners so decided to pick a better battle. if this was not the scenario i would have taken it... good example of not ever cherry picking.. they all are fking the same, lol

--- 帖子 #544 ---
new EL for long 893 a bit lower than the one on top... why I mention it?.. bcz it's vital to your success in defeating the chop or at least have a better chance of survival during such condition. how can you tell a chop coming... well.. the last long was quick +7 pips burst up and shot down,,, then the last short same thing... so the fkr is lost.. and the worst thing for you to do is to get involve off the tops and bottoms... so, you want to catch trades before reaching these areas or voided levels in order to have a chance at banking off the hesitations at these levels or catch bigger profit when it breaks the hell out.... and at least, the early positioning will help out on defending. dropping major knowledge for you right there off live real time analysis... humbly.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
short 769 EL out it for -3... struggle at the level... I had a chance to get out at BE... but gave it one tiny chance since it bust from -6 to +1 off the open candle of new hour... but then again same... gotta be act cold more.. played that like a wuss..

--- 帖子 #546 ---
note to self: get more sleep before trading this system Enjoyed the weekend a bit too much ima thinkin

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The last trade really pissed me off, lol I kept the damn thing for 47min, which is way above what I usually hold.. (but it mid London session so slower move is expected).. anyways, minute after my exit it took off long.. shakksss, lol

--- 帖子 #548 ---
navi... i see you looking into the thread all day long... I am in a good mood, so I let you out of ignore box, and try to forget telling me to go to hell, lol... but, only if you don't fk around again.... be a solid contributor bud, and follow the content of the thread.. here is a second chance..

--- 帖子 #549 ---
That's happened to me several times the past few days, I've being thinking there must be a psychological and stress level that brokers etc must know about before shifting direction... just thoughts passing as I trade. I knew I should have kept open to my target, 1.2694

--- 帖子 #550 ---
nahhh, got nothing to do with brokers.. they are small fish in this massive market to move anything. it all about the trader... always point the finger at yourself.. for me personally it was way over due to drop that trade... based on my plan trade must go in my direction a reasonable time and rhythm .. if it does not it's a dead play... regardless of outcome., but it does tick me off sometimes, lol 2694!!!...geeee thats elephant hunting, lol

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Yah I hear yah, I felt uncomfortable holding the last one as long as I did but I also knew that the BO was coming and even my trade had already broke the falling TL. I am on the backfoot atm though with a couple of loses. It just seems unusual with PA that so many trades can be closed at the top and bottom if a plan isn't adhered to, just makes me think that there is a something in us that can only take so many red pips or fear of losing profit when in green because I am sure there are many that do it. But nm perhaps another discussion for another thread.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
long EL 27059 good for +5.. this one was sitting right at daily pivot... so took it with not whole lot of tolerance and looking only for QCW... and thats what exactly was... happy with this trade. however if the break is for real.. it can go up for more... which is irrelevant to what we do here.. My daily target reached today atm.. for TE it comes to about between 15-20 pips $300..

--- 帖子 #553 ---
matt don't go for big profit bud... stay in control, little by little will become a mountain and over come any large negative... just a brotherly advice out of care..

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Yah, I hear you loud and clear. Got a mantra going atm "There will be another trade after this one" lol. Made all sorts of mistakes today and now greed is trying its hand.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
U.S market had opened sht... everything fallen... so maybe long still in play.. I was hoping for a better market to open and gunning the short EL for a strong drop to put the hammer on the beast for tonight, lol.. wishful thinking.. still time though lets see what happens.. who the hell knows where will it be swinging it.. right.. lol just to keep in the back of the mind and awareness..

--- 帖子 #556 ---
price having some trouble pass through the DP.. if market picks up a bit.. we could have a solid shot at the short EL 987.... remember if you take that and if it looked strong let it ride till real threat against.. thats what i will do.. so just sharing.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
short EL 987 for -3... that spinner candle got me as I tried to avoid a shoot up to other side... I don't care, it was showing all kinds of weakness in the heat of time... made the right play not about to give much back at nearly end of the trading session..

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I didn't get a spinner here but yah it was looking weak and after the amount of FO's today (not so much this system but just in general) I was ready to stop it too. Was watching other pairs though and was looking like the BO. Still not 100% if it's going to stick though. They pumping this level for all its got.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
sweet bank for you there, congrats... there was a big time fight at that level though and bears finally and barely won... just did not wanted to fall victim to it. I wish all that moves that were being put on was happening not right at the EL.. otherwise i would have stayed with it.... anyhow this is the move i wanted and was gunning for.. damn almost had it,, would had been great finish to the day for me.. I must admit, i was a bit to aggressive on that one.. wussieeee lil play, lol

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Cheers though even I was out a bit early I think. The 5 min 200ema was sitting about 3-4 pips lower (just hit). I was aiming for it but ...

--- 帖子 #561 ---
you did great, what you banked is monster.. U.S market made nice half way recover from a dismal open.. dollar got a bit strong as of that result.. the damn terrible open threw me off a bit..

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Yah cheers, though I'd prefer my normal trades that I screwed up today. 1 legitimate screw up cos I looked away for a moment (dam gf hehe) but the others I was trying to make up for and missed at least 3x 5 pipers... live and learn I think the next sell level is the "one" I have it around x77 atm and the PO makes a clear TL for the break imo.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
sure if you go with the low.. and going with the close would be 809... which is a better to do so especially dealing with long wicks.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Ok approaching London close which brings me to end of my normal trading hours.. I consider today as good start of the week, could have done better, but grateful.. stay green, night.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Good work mate. Glad to see you have picked your momentum up again after what seemed a couple of "off-days" last week. You do realise when you make a million out of that TE it's going to fund a trip for us all to your place for a party? Hehe. Green Pips .

--- 帖子 #566 ---
already gotta mil, lets just party... but since it's only you following, sounds more inexpensive, lol

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hehe, we will have to buy friends then. Had a long sleep in (longer than I wanted), so am feeling refreshed and can keep my eyes open today. A bit of EU data out today which should keep the charts rolling, the CPI out later is the one to keep an eye on. Also geopolitics could play a part if Hong Kong starts disrupting the market too much (luck to the people for full democracy).

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I am here everyday, Just to lazy to post. Dont feel alone. Had good day yesterday.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Morning guys... a bit of a late start for me but luckly have not missed any signal.. lets rock... just go triggered long as i am posting this..

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Heh, yah I've seen you loitering there WD yesterday. The system was good, but my trading of it wasn't. Better day today I hope

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Morning. Got triggered to. I am holding a bit deeper due positive news on German retail news.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
long EL 955 good for solid +5..

--- 帖子 #573 ---
ffs, howd you get 6 pips. It flicked there for me but I wasn't able to close it. Dam it I think I missed again

--- 帖子 #574 ---
fast fingers.. but more importantly, a predefined plan.. (the only edge) I advise you to bank if it gets anywhere near the top... beside the plan... there is also a 27000000 roundi there.. and days high... so better to bank.. ps) thank god for the TE... otherwise none of trolls would ever believe I got +6 there, lol

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I'm thinking it should head back up, though the up coming news may be problematic. I might have to close this in a loss.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
sigh. Got to get my head in the game. nm next.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
you should not even think about news... it can swing the hell out of you even its intention is to go in your direction... it's void play.. plus that is 45min away still... you could be in another trade before that.. always bank the QCW... clean quick winners within minutes is like free money,, take it, period.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Cheers yah need to faster on trigger. French consumer confidence was just released.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
moving on... short el is at 860.. tough spot when you take this... its between DP and DO and days low.. so be up for what you up against... so go in with defensive firstly then take what it comes to you... if it breaks then it could be to +10 or more in no time... same deal on top.. el at 997 right at roundi 270000 and days high... its a 21 pips range so far for EU.. most likely would break out of it.. so gotta be there.. just for awareness.. we take them all..

--- 帖子 #580 ---
took the -3 proudly on this one as it had me deep... the call was to preserve first survive the unknown after all kinds of threat and move against my position.. of course if I had held a just a tad longer i could have BE this... but it hesitated big time with all kind of jittery moves at the spot i got out.. survive the IFy ones and you be alright boys..

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I have a head ache now. Just had an argument with my broker. They think its ok that metals 4hr candles are sequenced 21:00, 00:00, 05:00 then normal, because they have a 45m roll over period. I haven't even being watching the current trade.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
if you have head ache, don't trade no more... close shop go out with your women for a ice cream or beer, lol I got one thing about brokers... they are always right.. like the casinos... but also like casinos there are lots of them.. so go to the one next door that suits you better instead of useless arguments..

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I'll be ok in a few minutes. The issue isn't a deal breaker and aside from that conversation most of my dealings have been pretty good. Besides it will pretty hard to get up and go atm, I have lt positions some red some green but would be a loss of profit if I closed now. I have thick skin, I will be ok. Closed at B.E., next trade

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hourly seems stuck in a 50pip range, PA seems hesitant to choose a direction before large news releases later this week.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
.. da beast, king of all cover up artists.. if you know what I mean no worries we get'em..

--- 帖子 #586 ---
anybody knows what just happen on EU?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
More like what just happened to USD. Almost across the board, not just EU.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
correct brother... welcome to elaborate a bit more.. EU = euro/usd pair... so talking about both as where 40% off all currency trading takes place..

--- 帖子 #589 ---
anyways this what happen... The EU straight up 1300+ march is on strongly and just moments ago tested the 22 month low dating back to nov 2012... tested and bounced... dollar is strong.. not that I care much or would make whole lot of difference, but it don't hurt to know and be aware of... I am just forest gump... i follow foot steps and leave all the fancy stuff to the fancy pansies, lol

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Was probably GBP news release. Also looked consistent with a TA break (14hr break on usdchf etc). Edit: UJ imo is the true indicator for correlation atm though.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I never care about what caused it or reasons or what and where could go to based on what where happened or will continue to happen etc... that's all stories.. I only care about whats happening in front of my eyes, the reality... and to play accordingly to that.. saves one from all kinds of head aches, pressure and for sure to be on the opposite side of the move.. nightmare, lol

--- 帖子 #592 ---
gunning for hiccups... be ready You want two opposite candle, small loop/gap, for a solid EL to get on the direction of masses..

--- 帖子 #593 ---
You guys like to be on such massive moves as EU repeatedly has displayed in the last 5 months.. runner style!!?... stick with me and just might show you down the road how is done.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
.. is it really on to happen, dollar down to 1.20... that be fking great.. go usaaaaaa..

--- 帖子 #595 ---
short EL 25962 for +3.. I was hoping it would drop another leg or so.. but too much hesitation at the LL made the call for me to settle on small gain.. got may chunk out of it.. could drop though

--- 帖子 #596 ---
lolllll............. this is when you say.. SOB ... almost had it..

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Not watching this system too closely today soz, due to my main account trades. Still open on that short, expecting further down move but may retrace for a bit.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
matt buddy stay in control... may i elaborate couple of matters on your last couple of trades?... I don't mind if you say no... bcz i know it's tough time for you atm.. anyways if you need me I am here..

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Idm mate but prob no need. I wasn't watching these trades due to my main acc trades which take precidence over this system. I should of closed at a couple of opportunities but my concentration was elsewhere. I am mainly heavy in Gold atm and PA is moving.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
long el 25970 out for +4... i was taking way too much time to even make it to the green land.. and when it did, major struggle at 2600000000 roundi,.. since long is massively against the trend, so i was on my toes finger ready... I watch this one on 1m to make sure i wont miss a tick and fall victim to a quick burst bounce.. as you see i did not allow it to breath much, lol but don't make a habbit of watching m1... it does more harm than good... only occasionally certain situations. both pic placed..

--- 帖子 #601 ---
np bud... but your EL on the buy 12 pips loss trade is wrong... thats what had me concerned, thats all. ps) out of curiosity what is Idm!!, lol

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Yah your right, thanks, it wasn't right. It shows how distracted I was. IDM = I don't Mind

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Your last trade was really good. Pity you missed the level after though.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I did not miss... I passed.. I been hesitant to go against the bear today to fall victim to selling burst.. this is a good example of NOT cherry picking.. lol

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I have decided to take my TE down. It's not because I am worried about ppl seeing my bad results but rather it is a false result of the success of this system. The past couple of days I have being spending a lot of time with my main accounts trades and even though I may enter a trade on this system I haven't been able to sit on the close button. There have been times when minutes have passed before checking the trade. I will start again when my trading on my main account is a bit thinner.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Morning to all.. happy hunting.. go green..

--- 帖子 #607 ---
hi matt.. do as you wish and feel comfortable brother, bcz thats what it's all about.. and the last thing you want to worry about are people (especially ff) or system success or failure... as i have mentioned in the past, this is not a system, the system is YOU.. one can in a good day to succeed greatly and on a very same day the other can fked up really good. My wining or losing results or yours or anyone else don't mean damn thing to the next guy... one needs to put in the time for understanding, absorbing and practice.. must have enough trades under ones belt to filter all the mistakes and ups and downs before able to play the attach and defense smoothly. so keep on rocking as you feel comfortable.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Cheers mate. I guess I call it a system because there's not really another description but your right. The entry for the trades is quite set in stone but the exit can be quite discretionary and reliant on PA at the time. I am not worried about the loses but more about not being able to give it a 100% atm. I have a lot of money tied up in my main account so I just think it is better not to be distracted for both fronts, my own and also this PA trading. Don't worry, I will be back real soon as I enjoy this "system" but especially during NFP week I need to remain focused on my main acc. GL

--- 帖子 #609 ---
cool, go take care of business. as for me... I have laid out the foundation with many details and example on live full visual plays. My activity in this thread will also be limited.. I have stayed active bcz of folks like you and a few others who were true followers, did wanted to abandon, lol .. but you all have got the main picture by now, maybe not in full for advance levels, but enough to still make solid profit. don't worry guys TE stays for now, for your reviews and due diligence by following of the actions which speaks louder than words.. and i do my best to attend to your questions or concerns if any, it just may not be promptly. talk at you all later..

--- 帖子 #610 ---
A big thank you for sharing your system (hehe just had to say it) and all your thoughts and strategies along with the examples on your TE, a big help. I wont be far away and will still drop in on the thread when anything new happens. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
First trade for morning . Very carefull because before FO and on RN abd news at LO. Moving to slow and took only 1.5. Defence

--- 帖子 #612 ---
2nd. Same thinking as before. Only took 2.5. FXE took 5.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Had a bit of time to spare from my main account this week and have being trading this method quite hard (though still a little distracted at times) with great results so far (touch wood ). I traded it last week with loses that were a combination of being very distracted and also unfriendly PA. I think it had a little to do with being NFP (etc) week and lots of uncertainty and am interested to see how the start of next month goes. This week PA has being trending in one direction or another and as predicted the system loves a trend (st or lt). Good to see you pulling back from similar loses Empire.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Gah I'm gettin FO after FO today..... Crap PA for this method today. If doesn't pick up when U.S. comes online will leave it for the week. This weeks trades went well otherwise.

Hi.. This post is for true followers of this thread and my work overall. As you may have noticed I have taken off my TE from public to private. Three reasons.. one, people who do not study the material never bother to get at least some of the concept come out and question the TE's every curve or instance.. two, people who have no business to judge anything due to lack of qualification, and that's not just regards to trading but life commonsense generally speaking.. three, unfortunately in this forum we got a lot of disgraced, ungrateful members who keep track of your work, take positive elements out of it but yet go on and bash it and talk none sense, for the sole reason of their shattered ego, empty pathetic way of being and perhaps a sever early childhood abuse victimization or whatever heck else.. so I don't want them to see the details of the trades. ..of course as this is not a news to me about these piker trolls, knew it along but never cared and just let them have it regardless. However now i have come to realize that NO they don't deserve it better to let them keep on rolling in their massive dismal life, they wouldn't even know how to deal with a financial freedom, lol. .. so I have put my TE to private. Most these pikers got nothing to do but to wounder around forums and to only troll, talk smack while visualizing illusions of what they wanted or should've could've been, lol... it's truly too funny when is observed... yet they can not ever show anything for real, they are mostly under capital and for sure can't trade for sht.. mostly what i have observed are addict gamblers high on cheap wine alcohol, lol. I must admit that i can not stand such people, not in here or my real life... I fire people as such on the spot in my firm.. it's only a online sites that these pikers can give it go for their egos, lol. anyways, If you feel abandon in this regard please understand the reasoning of where I am coming from. I also don't see no activity here.. true I am not here much either.. however if i see one is truly following and really trying by showing activities and don't seem suspicious, then, up on your request I would put the TE for full visibility to you. .. in the mean time I'll show the snap shots of my results on daily or weekly basis, so you could compare with yours... if your truly have studied and grasped the concept, and actually trading the method, then the snap shot would serve the purpose by giving just enough info. Plus it's my thread i can do what i see fit. I have left enough solid martial and information, so putting the two together you can be very successful. now the troll will come after this post... I want you to let your know in advance... i will report you and put you on ignore faster than bullet can fly... I am tired of your sorry nonsense poor souls.. get a life, you know who you are that i am talking too.

Hello FXEmpire, you probably don't visit thread often anymore, but if do pass by, I have got one question please that needs clarification. I notice that on your charts, sometimes you draw your EL at the tip of a wick, other times at the close of a body. Which is which and why the inconsistency? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hi Dan, I have explained this a bit in the first post and later on with live examples in the later pages.. but I go ahead and answer your question. a valid EL consist of having gap/loop... now if you have that gap off the close of the candle then thats you EL.. if not then you take your shot off the wick. I hope it's clear.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi FXEmpire. Thanks for replying and answering my question nonetheless, much appreciated. Okay, what's a gap/loop? I did come across you using this term a few times in the thread, but it wasn't clearly explained. Many thanks

--- 帖子 #187 ---
read the thread plz dan.. there are plenty of chart examples of gap/loop... just the word itself should clarify it.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Have read the thread, but will re-read it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi FXEMPIRE, I have reading your thread and trying this technique out. I must congratulate you on presenting such a graceful system. The lack of dependency on irrelevant indicators and filtering points to the strength and simplicity of the approach. I have also been following Fezmars thread where you recently commented on the money management approach. I was wondering something down that line. In fact I was thinking what do you think of applying your entry approach for that process. Instead of taking profits on all the trades leave done on the table to develop? Do you get a high enough hit rate(50%) required for that approach to be highly successful? I am asking you cause I am trying to see how much I should be improving my technique achieve close to what you are achieving. Thanks, Kash

--- 帖子 #190 ---
kash i don't use as tight of a hard stop like a 5pips, more like 10 or 15 as an emergency one... then I use slick exit out play where my average loss comes to about 5 pips.. which average from 10 pips loss to -1... that does not mean a particular trade has survived a 5pips hard stop.. so I would not know what exactly would be the hit ratio on a firm 5 pips stop but can't imagine any approach with a 5pip hard stop would be a consistent 50% hit... and that is one of the downfall of fezmar approach. The tight stop would take out many trades which he also has confirmed surly... but the problem is that it will kick one out of some major runs, the "THE" runs where is vitally needed for such methods to be a profitable one and not just a breakeven one after months of agonies. I am scalper and use different entries as has been explained in this thread and my Scalper thread, all mostly off 5m tf... I look to make a buck each day, that's the main goal and as a secondary goal if lucky enough to maybe have couple or several trades after week of trading who broke out for me quick and cleanly left alone running large at 1/4 of my original load all risk free like a bonus profit. I think the best way to approach a large RR running method is to have the losses compensated already and not carried on... bcz then your highly depending on significant market runs, all, to firstly compensate the already losses and then to make some profit.. now this whole process while dealing with ever constant changing currency market environment makes it very difficult to manage, hard on the psyche to say the least to perform and make best profitable decisions. anyways i hop it helps you.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi FxEmpire, Thanks for your reply. It really helps. I understand that you don't use a hardstop at 5pip but more like a 10-15 pip hard stop. However, since you nurse your trades you take an average loss of about 5pip. So, using you approach what is your win rate roughly? Because I think the average 5 pip loss should be sufficient for Fez's approach. Also, I like what you suggested about taking 3/4 trades out. But, I think a more better compromise would be to just set the SL to BE+5 and hope that it is a runner. I don't think BE+5 is very different from setting at BE that Fez does. How many trades do you think would come back and return from that 5pip range? Not many I think... Hence my interest in your method.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
well i disagree.. When a particular trade goes to +5... at this time stop is moved to BE... the chances of this BE play to be take out immediately is rather high and even if it breaks away for lets say to 10 or 20 then one more hiccup is on the way to where it would come back to just hit your BE stop much as less a +5 and then to resume or reverse who knows. I am a scalper i deal with this all day everyday especially when trades taken off the pullback... on BO entries you could get a strong straight shoot away at times but with that one deals with more fake outs. overall based on my experience in such scenarios of tight spot plays is the reason i suggested to take advantage of that little immediate 5 pips move and bank 3/4 to ease the carrying on losses but it's a trade off. my hit rate is irrelevant to me as long as is not under 35%.. with 50% hit i am golden since my rr is 1:2 or 1: 1.6.. taking to account my flexible exit, it's safe to say i manage 40% to 60%.. to give you a live example.. today so far made 11 trades since franky open for 5-6 +21pips (commission/spread included in) in the order.. -4 -4 +12 -2 -11 +8 +10 +7 +10 -3 -2 avg loss -4.. avg win +9
