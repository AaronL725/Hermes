Hi guys &amp; girls, using my statistical knowledge i`ve put up the most optimal gambling trading system that can be used in forex.But first a little disclaimer: RISK DISCLAIMER: BY USING THIS SYSTEM YOU AGREE TO NOT HOLD ME RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY FINANCIAL OR OTHER TYPE OF LOSSES OCCURRING BY USING THIS SYSTEM, NOR FOR ANY OTHER INFORMATION NOR FILE WHICH IS PRESENT IN THIS THREAD. IT IS A GAMBLING SYSTEM, SO IN THE LONG TERM THIS WILL LOSE YOU MONEY , BUT IN THE SHORT TERM IT CAN BE PROFITABLE .IT IS A VERY VERY HIGH RISK SYSTEM,IT COULD WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE ACCOUNT, SO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF IT, AND DON'T RISK MORE MONEY THAN YOU CAN AFFORD. 1)BASIC STATISTICS UPON WHICH I BUILT THE SYSTEM (i know its boring but its useful to read it): Using all my statistical knowledge, i will show you how to maximize your gambling chances with this system.Most of you know about me that i dont like using indicators of any sort, but in this thread we will make an exception.The Bollinger Band and a Simple Moving average will guide us.Most of you dont know how to use the BB correctly, so i will show you how to use them correctly. First of all, the Bollinger Band is not a range bouncing indicator or any of that sort, by using it as a range bound indicator to buy at low band sell at high band, is the biggest mistake one can make.The BB is a statistical tool, and measures the standard deviation of the distribution of the candlesticks. For those of you who dont know anything about statistics, you can learn quick the basics here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution The system will use the " 3 sigma rule " but we will use 7 sigma to ensure our odds of losing to be very very small.If the price is normally distributed, then we'd have a 99.999999999744% winrate.But PipMeUp showed that the price follows somewhat a Cauchy distribution which has a fat tail , so if we use even a 7 sigma distance for the STOPLOSS, our winrate will be less than that because the price has a bigger chance to deviate away from the median of a certain period, we use 5 days, but the winrate will be still very high. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...58#post6646358 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is a little spreadsheet to calculate it: Attached File(s) cauchy.xlsx 25 KB | 1,237 downloads But the difference is that a Cauchy Distribution has an infinite range, whereas the forex market cannot have an infinite range because of liquidity, so in any way the price must reverse at some point (less chance during Quantitavie Easing when the Central Banks pump liquidity).But still have a fat tail, so we must use a very high deviation to counter that. So because of this its hard to calculate exactly the winrate but its still higher than 95% presented in my system.I will rely on my backtest data to estimate the winrate. ============================================================================================== 2) PHILOSOPHY OF THE SYSTEM The system will lose in the long term, and 1 loss can wipe out a significant portion of the account ( OR CAN WIPE IT OUT COMPLETELY ) , but the system has a so high winrate that it is very unlikely,nearly impossible that a loss can occur.So the longer you use it, the most likely the loss will occur (of course the outcome of each trade is statistically independent but still, the longer you try eventually you will take a loss at some point). Because of this, since we have a very very high probability of succes, we must take advantage of it, be incrementing the LOT size acordingly to it. So you cant use this system indefinitely, have to stop at some point or risk losing everything, but hopefully before a loss will come to wipe everything, we can already make much money. Its also good to withdraw cash regularly after all trades are closed, but dont close a trade prematurely. We could use the lot formula which would increment the lot size accordingly to risk a certain % of the account balance.But why bother? Instead to maximize the efficiency of our advantage of the winrate, we will always increment the LOT size, but make sure if the SL will be very wide to not stop incrementing it. You dont want to get a margin call, and also use smaller leverage for this. So the risk is very high, but also the winrate, and the potential reward too, so make sure you can afford the risk.1 loss could wipe out the entire account, but the chances of it is still remotely small. ============================================================================================== 3) THE SYSTEM You will only need a Bollinger Band and a Simple Moving Average, the system can be automated, but it can be used manually too. Since our system profits from the distribution of candlesticks, and since the distribution of the price has a small chance of occurring in the tail of its distribution graph, we will use a very high period BB. Pair: Smallest spread pair ,the smaller the spread the better the chances, so EUR/USD Timeframe: H1 (1 HOUR CHART) Bollinger Band: Use it on H1 (1 hour chart) and set it to period 120 = 24*5 , so it will look at the distibutions of the past 120 hours, a.k.a last 5 days of trading.Since the price sentiment usually changes weekly, the BB will learn the distribution of sticks within a week.Set the deviation to 7. Moving Average : Timeframe H1, period 120, price close, and simple moving average The middle line of the BB is exactly the SMA if you wondered, but it will give you a better visualization if you set the MA to another color BUY ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved above the SMA, and previously it was below or equal to the SMA, you enter long SELL ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved below the SMA, and previously it was above or equal to the SMA, you enter short You dont have to wait for the price to close, since a close of a stick on H1 is 1 hour, and you might miss your 4 pip trade chance, the quicker you enter after the price penetrated above/below the SMA, the better the chances. TAKEPROFIT: STOPLEVEL + 1 or 2 pipette , the smaller the TP the better the chances, so the smallest TP is your STOPLEVEL , my broker gives me a 40 pipette STOPLEVEL on the E/U + 1 or 2 pipettes depending on the volatility is 42 pipette on 5 digit broker or 4.2 pips ~ 4 pips on 4 digit broker.If your STOPLEVEL is bigger or smaller on the E/U, you have to calculate it. BUY STOPLOSS : Exactly at the lower band of the Bollinger Band, so the chance of losing is 7 sigma small SELL STOPLOSS : Exactly at the upper band of the Bollinger Band, so the chance of losing is 7 sigma small You might think the RR is too small, but its mathematically proven that the chances of hitting your stop is very small, since we use a 7 sigma deviation,its very very small.Besides way its better than a NO SL system, and than a fixed SL system.You SL is dynamically set according to the distribution of candlesticks in your chart. LOT SIZE : Since there is no point in adjusting the LOT to the % of risk of capital since our SL is small, we want to make the most cash possible until a loss comes and wipes our account. So the system uses 1% of the account balance (just to not get a margin call, but you can use more if you have more capital &amp; small leverage). The formula to convert that into LOT is: LOT = ACCOUNTBALANCEINCASH * RISKPERCENT/10000 So for 100$ the LOT = 100* 1/10000 = 0.01 in MT4 lot units or 1000 LOT UNITS (1 MICROLOT) And adjust the lot size as your account increases. ALSO MAKE SURE: STOPLOSSSIZE * TICKSIZE * LOTUNITS &lt; FREEMARGIN , to not get a margin call , use smaller lot size if necessary! FREEMARGIN = (ACCOUNTBALANCE - MARGIN REQUIREMENT) NOTICES : Make sure your leverage is small not more than preferably 1:50 or 1:25 not more, so dont get a margin call when your SL will be very wide, and if you dont have enough cash in the account use smaller than 10% of your balance.Try to not enter on news, make sure your slippage is small, and the spread too.Also never move your SL or TP, or you compromise the system, so your trades could be on for days, so if you might get swap bonuses overnight or pay the swap depending on the currency, but with the EUR/USD you will lose a bit money there because of negative swaps , but not much. FACTORS WHICH CAN IMPROVE THE PROBABILITY OF SUCCES : the smaller the Takeprofit the better, but a STOPLEVEL + a few pipette sized TP is good the smaller the spread &amp; slippage the better the less volatility in the pair the better the higher liquidity the better (assuming that the volatility is low) the higher the deviation the better (7 sigma deviation is enough) after the price moves below/above the simple moving average , the quicker you put in the BUY/SELL order, the better chance of winning it, dont let the price move too far away from the SMA because the odds of failure increase by every pip away from the SMA. the longer the period of the BB the better, we use 5 days price distribution (24*5 hours =120 period) which is fairly enough, because the sentiment changes somewhat every week, so the BB will contain the entire weekly distribution of the price, so the price deviating away for than 7 sigma from the weekly median is very very small, so perfect option to put the STOPLOSS outside it. stay away from all news, and high volatility events, but dont close the trades manually once they are on, and never move the TP or the SL LATEST VERSION 1.5 CAN BE SEEN HERE (post #330): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post7248548 EXPERT ADVISOR FOR V1.5 (post #352): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...53#post7256253

UPDATE: VERSION 1.3 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Did a few backtests and optimizations, and i had to update the system DEVIATION 7 is too much and unnecessary, if the data sample is increased, then DEVIATION 6 is enough By using deviation 6 risk is reduced by atleast 15% even if we lose we lose less , and less chance for margin call We will use now period 480 on 1 H chart, so we will check 20 days price fluctuation now LOT SIZE= 2% of the account balance to not get margin called Pair: Smallest spread pair ,the smaller the spread the better the chances, so EUR/USD Timeframe: H1 (1 HOUR CHART) Bollinger Band: Use it on H1 (1 hour chart) and set it to period 480 = 24*20 , so it will look at the distibutions of the past 480 hours, a.k.a last 20 days of trading. Set the deviation to 6. Moving Average : Timeframe H1, period 480, price close, and simple moving average BUY ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved above the SMA, and previously it was below or equal to the SMA, you enter long SELL ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved below the SMA, and previously it was above or equal to the SMA, you enter short TAKEPROFIT: STOPLEVEL + 1 or 2 pipette , the smaller the TP the better the chances, so the smallest TP is your STOPLEVEL , my broker gives me a 40 pipette STOPLEVEL on the E/U + 1 or 2 pipettes depending on the volatility is 42 pipette on 5 digit broker or 4.2 pips ~ 4 pips on 4 digit broker.If your STOPLEVEL is bigger or smaller on the E/U, you have to calculate it. BUY STOPLOSS : Exactly at the lower band of the Bollinger Band, so the chance of losing is 4 sigma small SELL STOPLOSS : Exactly at the upper band of the Bollinger Band, so the chance of losing is 4 sigma small LOT SIZE : we will use now 2% of the account balance LOT SIZE (in MT4) = ACCOUNTBALANCEINCASH * RISKPERCENT/10000 Only 1 order open at a time, dont move SL or TP, and dont close orders manually, wait for rebounce to your TP.

So your going for MIN TP then, as small as possible there reducing your exposure, but increasing the amount of trades you have to make and therefore exposing yourself to a run against you. Toying with the idea of doing similar, based on trend following but with a 50 - 100tp, no SL, just a $50 micro account, something to feed my gambling while I trade my proper account proper like!! Mainly something to deter the newbie's away from no SL trading of this sort, which is becoming annoyingly the next best ever grail around here. Yes I will and can afford to lose the $50 it's sacrificial and there will be a TE Basically I'll go the opposite way to you and then there is examples of both failing, although only 1 trade at a time the same! I'll trade GA or EJ and I'll use the best edge I can think of, so therefore it's a semi serious attempt for a more real test. p.s. explain Sigma to none scientists, not many will get that!

BACKTESTS: Sorry for many editings and new fixes, but i had to make sure i fix every parameter.I`m happy to announce, that the V1.3 of the system can run 1 year without any loss.So its 100% winrate for year 2013-2014. Here are some backtests: 1) Average daily spread set to 1 pip =10 pipette on 5 digit broker, initial capital 100 € , lot size 2% of the capital, TAKEPROFIT 41 pipette or 4 pip, year 2013-2014, EUR/USD , ultra-high quality tick based historical data (over 10 GB) Attached Image (click to enlarge) RETURN: 47.22% /year , no SL hit, yet there were a few minor losses when the TP closed at a negative profit because of gaps &amp; slippage Attached File(s) backtest1.rar 13 KB | 646 downloads 2) Average daily spread set to 1 pip =10 pipette on 5 digit broker, initial capital 100 € , lot size 2% of the capital, TAKEPROFIT 41 pipette or 4 pip, year 2012-2013, EUR/USD , ultra-high quality tick based historical data (over 10 GB) Attached Image (click to enlarge) RETURN: - 87.76% /year ,SL was hit 2 times, Attached File(s) backtest2.rar 15 KB | 585 downloads

Not at all, every outcome of any trade is statistically independent from eachother.The same % of win or lose for all of them, so its more like, more trades more profit and same chance of profit. Putting NO SL is stupid, we already know that, but putting a very wide SL without any justification is also stupid, the BB is a great statistical tool, probably the only indicator i use, and helps you to analyse the distribution of sticks. And because of aligning our SL with the BB indicator, we can vary the RR smart and the most optimal way to get the least losses possible.Because 6 sigma is a very unlikely event so its wise to put the SL there, because it will reduce the odds of a loser trades significantly. I`m not stating that its a no loss system, such doesnt exits, but hopefully before a loss comes you already make a lot of money, and you can stop then. The GBP/AUD and the EUR/JPY has both a high volatility , high daily range, and higher spread than the EUR/USD, so its not the best pair, with this strategy its not good to use, you will greatly lower your chances if you will trade on those pairs. Just use EUR/USD and its fine.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
The point is to show failure, while trying not to fail, like all the newbies will be doing, you can show failure via this method and I'll pretend to be smarter and show failure via another method, while being sensible. I'll go no SL and ensure 700pips before MC, So I'll need a $75 account I guess!! 10cents per pip! $5 margin requirement I suspect.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yep, the system just failed in 2012, but still survived 1 year, not bad for start. I didnt said its a no lose holy grail system, but it has still very high odds of succes. I will reconfigure the parameters in v1.4, soon, and hopefully the system now will last more than 1 year So i`ll keep u updated guys! I`m also open for suggestion guys, so if anyone has any ideas how to improve the system, please share it with us

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yadix allows you put a take profit (and stop loss) as near to the current price as you like. If that helps?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I think the TP is good as it is, further decreasing it would greatly diminish our gains, and not improve our probability of winning by that much. I think by optimizing the bollinger settings, and adjusting the SL according to that helps us to imporove the winrate by more than adjusting the TP. Besides the last thing i want to do is to create a "1 pipper", because the slippage and spread will destroy that. 41 pipettes or 4 pips is a nice TAKEPROFIT for me atleast.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I thought you would probably think that but didn't know if you were aware of the option. Good luck with the system.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks, i`m working on it for 4 hours continuously, expect a huge update which will decrease the chance of loss to almost 0, and triple the yearly return And also now it works on 2012-2013 too, here is the 2012 return: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Can you share your EA, I could help you on the backtest among other markets with quality data.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Not yet, i`ve used my old EA and modified it to test this system, but the functions are not yet good for demo or forward test, but i will release that probably but not yet. Until then here is a little more teaser of the 2013-2014 year backtest, more trades, more profit, higher winrate (99.999...%): Attached Image (click to enlarge) from 47.22% return/year to 178.31% , i excluded the month December to let the price reverse in our direction, and not have trades near the new year.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I like this kind of trading analysis, what settings did you change from post #2?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Reduced the period of the BB because the autoregression of the price is not that long and strong in short periods of time so why bother.Instead increased the deviation to a high level, but also experimenting with something very new.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Sorry for the interruption but whts the role of bb in taking buy/sell decision.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
The BB is only used for SL at upper/lower bands.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Subscribed. Look really really interesting!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Look like another holy grail.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Ok, so just thinking out loud here but isn't this the type of thing you could use to increase your account massively or blow you out completely? If the strike rate is high enough then surely you could use it to double your account in a short space of time then just withdraw your profits and do it again? If it blows up then so what? As long as you double your account more often than you blow it then you're banking money. Just an idea.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
You'll be surprised as to how fast and easily the account grows, then damn right horrified as to how fast it all goes away Back tests look interesting though!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Yes, that's what I mean though... double it, withdraw half, double it, withdraw half, double it, withdraw half, lose initial stake, start again, etc, etc.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Half of it not because that would compromise the probabilities, because you will then have a higher chance for margin call.Instead only withdraw the profits, and hope that the profits will be bigger than the initial capital, which will be, so that even if you lose the account at some point, the cash you withdrawed was much greater than the initial capital deposited.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Soon i`ll post the update, i just had an important thing to do this afternoon so i`m back to work on the system now.Here is how it looks on backtest, no losses so far: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) In case you wondered, the new system will be traded on the 1M chart, so we will have atleast 20-30 no-loss trades/day

--- 帖子 #25 ---
UPDATE: VERSION 1.4 (HUGE UPDATE) Yearly return almost quadrupled since previous tries Risk of wiping out the account now can only happen with margin call, and its very reduced The system will no longer use a SL, if we lost a trade that will wipe out the entire account anyway, so it gives the price more space for rebound.I know its a very high risk situation, so only use cash that you can afford to lose! Money should be withdrawed frequently, but only the profit to keep the initial balance there, so that the % of a margin call happening is constant, not increased More trades, and higher winrate The system has now more frequent trades and probably easier to use Bollinger band removed since the system now doesnt have a SL, so its no point using it Pair: EUR/USD Timeframe: M1 (1 Minute chart) Moving Average : Timeframe M1, period 30, price close, and simple moving average, shift 0 BUY ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved above the SMA, and previously it was below or equal to the SMA, you enter long SELL ENTRY : If the price closed or simply moved below the SMA, and previously it was above or equal to the SMA, you enter short TAKEPROFIT: 100 pipettes on 5 digit broker or 10 pips on 4 digit broker STOPLOSS : None LOT SIZE : we will use now 1% of the account balance LEVERAGE: 1:1 is the best, the more the leverage the higher chance of the margin call. LOT SIZE (in MT4) = ACCOUNTBALANCEINCASH * RISKPERCENT/10000 Only 1 order open at a time, dont move TP, and dont close orders manually, wait for rebounce to your TP.Also dont forget to withdraw the profits frequently in case the margin call will wipe out the account.

You started a TE to go along with your thread. Whether it works or not, this is the right way to do things.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes, i just finished the beta version of the EA, so it is time to put a TE to see how well the system works in forward test.I will mostly trade @ LONDON-&gt; NY session when the spread is low, but i checked and the spread didnt made that much difference, so basically you can trade this system at any time except news time, and also i`m following the V1.4 rules. Also using 1:100 leverage on the account to reduce the margin call's chance as much as possible on a this small demo account of 100€. Here is a pic of my gamble EA in beta version: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Good luck with your forward tests. Best way to learn is to watch and see for yourself! Great efforts Prox. I knew ya had it in ya!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
LOL i cant believe i`m using NO SL system ,just like you . But alteast mine is more optimized to diminish the chances of a margin call as much as possible, but we shall see how good idea is it. Lot is 1% of the account, so the chance of a MC is almost none, while TP 100 pipette and a 1:100 leverage is also acceptable.But only trading on EUR/USD because its low volatility and low spread size.Its very optimal if i`d say that way.

A journey of a thousand miles always starts with the first step.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Looks interesting enough.. Good luck buddy!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Way to go Prox! Are you going both long and short? What happens if you get caught in a trend?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
What do you mean by that, not simultaneously, its not a grid system, but we trade in each way if the trigger is right.But only 1 trade active at once. If i get caught in a trend then i pray that it will reverse, and it probably will, no trend lasts forever, sometimes an order can be open for weeks if its too negative, but eventually it will bounce back.Its important to have the discipline to not interfere with the orders once they are set, only wait and let the market sort it out.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Got it!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Please clarify. If TP is not reached and condition for entry is met in the opposite direction, you should not the trade? Thanks

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Nope, only 1 active trade at a time, otherwise the risk of margin call increases, imagine of both trades go wrong that doubles the chance of margin call.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
It has been 2 hours since i opened the trade.Probably at an unlucky position, lets hope it will reverse, probably it will in 1 or maximum 2 hours: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

M1 EURUSD. Bottom indicator shows each time the 30SMA gets breached. Green above, red below. Just a little visual for ya.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thats nice, it can be useful for those who trade this system manually. But i trade it with my EA, so its for no use to me Maybe you can post a link to this indicator.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Commodity Channel Index, set to period 30, Close. Stock Meta4 indicator. Set only the zero line. This is just a coloured version.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
The system takes only 1 trade at a time, it doesnt take another trade until all of them are closed.Its not an averaging/ pyramid system.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
i was wrong then, sorry. deleted.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
This seems nice but a time will come that u will get a trade at a multi year high or low. So, sure you acct survives, sure you only have 1 trade but basically the system will stop trading until that high/low is taken out. Can you wait for years or will you bite the bullet and close the trade a lose and start again? This is the question that each person needs to answer. How long can you wait? 1 week no trade? 2 weeks no trade? 30 weeks no trade? Not trading means not earning to cover the drawdown.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Increase account massively? Doesn't look like that to me. This will give you decent returns, considering the low frequency of instances where price crosses the middle BB band. Also the target is quite modest. Looks like a steady gainer with some risk.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Default middle BBand is a 20SMA.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
No prob. What can you do but wait? Exit ? When ? Where? Why? If the price will reverse then its worth the waiting assuming that it will.If it wont then bad luck, no way of knowing that ahead, so i would prefer waiting. The worst thing can happen is it wipes out your account.That is depending on the leverage, lotsize, and capital in your account, because everything else is somewhat static.Those are the only things to worry about. Of course risking a larger account is not an option, but decreasing the lot size to 0.5 -1% is a good option, and also using 1:1 leverage is a good option too. 30 weeks is just insane, i`ve never seen any trade last longer than 2 months, and that was after 2 year of backtest.No way it will last more than 3-4 months, it will either give a MC or reverse sooner.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
We use 30 SMA here it is the most optimal with 100 pipette TP.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thus the reason I made mention of that. Unless Shiva was referring to using a 30 BB...but even at this, I don't know what the point is. CCI 30 cross zero, Cross Middle Band of BB 30, and Price close against SMA 30 are 3 ways of saying the exact same thing.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Finally that nasty SELL trade finally hit the TP.Also won another quick one, so its now 2 wins in a row (wonder how many more i will get).

Hey Magix, looks like my system will make more return /day than yours in its entire career

cheeky boy,,,,,if you do that i'll show mine lol

--- 帖子 #53 ---
I mean seriously, i bet that the system will reach 10% gain by the end of the day if i let my PC on the entire day. Others cant make 10% gain in a month, let alone a day I think this system will be popular on FF.

I just started longing g/j like earlier, trading similar to your method Proxy

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Crap , accidentally i closed 1 trade manually.Bad luck.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
how odd, when I was putting my g/j long on, my pc crashed lol

--- 帖子 #59 ---
What do you mean by similar ? I use the MA as a tool to find the clusters of price as price will tend to fluctuate around the MA.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Here's my version of the ea. It doesn't wait for a candle to close, according to the instructions a cross is enough. I ran it on eurusd and it wins about 9 trades but then puts a sell on at 1.32616 on 13th September and it doesn't come back. That's 4 months now, would you want to wait that long?! Maybe a more ranging pair like eurchf would be better. Or how about usdhkd? You'd have to stop it from taking trades near the range tops but that could be coded into it. Also to use 1:1 leverage then you need to trade 0.01 per every £1000 in your account so that's what it does.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
oh, I do that in my head and just have a 20 ema on chart,, perhaps it isn't similar but it is to me, lol

--- 帖子 #62 ---
How does the leverage affect this.We use a 0.5 - 1% lot size, so basically the lot requirements are small.I`m using a 1:100 leverage to pay less margin requirement, because the more cash remains in the account the less chance of a margin call. I`m not sure how your EA works, but i will release mine too soon.I think you made a few mistakes here and there.For me it will always bounce back, and the longest wait time is about 1 month now.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Bud, I will keep my mouth shut or I will probably confuse you. I have spent years watching charts and running tests, anyway ,,,with this trade I got on, it is the original trade I was asked to do regarding gbp/jpn and the outside bars, I entered long after the breach of outside bar AND the 20 ema was breached AND PC crash, lets see what happens, IT might just end up a long day for me to trade it back into profit, Be good and again I shall be quiet

--- 帖子 #64 ---
How many good trades does it take to double the account? Or how long? (with 100 euros) It could be good given you can double your balance and then pull out.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Ok then, btw finally i`ve recovered from that nasty mistake of mine I`m now backtesting the system for better configurations.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
good,,, just take care that you do not fit the history in the backtest

--- 帖子 #67 ---
With my modified settings, i`ve set the TP to 35 pipettes, so including spread, then each winner trade gives us around 0.2-0.3 % return. So with 100 euro and 0.01 lot start, assuming my spread, it would give 0.26 cent/trade,for now, after the balance grows, the lot size will increment aswell. I dont know yet when its good time to pull out, but i`m still backtesting the system for better configurations.

oil is looking good lol

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Proximus, thanks for the thread and the idea / system you are sharing. I started trying your system on demo.....6 from 6 winners, maximum drawdown..about 12 pips with one of the trades. Good so far, but worried about SL. Will continue to forward test, however starting to think of some ideas surrounding hard stops to put in place if I start trading it live. Just some thoughts.

Proximus - are you factoring in swap given that some trades could be held for weeks/months even?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
That's a good point.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
You've said several times that 1:1 leverage is desirable so that's what I used. That means to open a 0.01 position you would need £1000 in your account. I coded it to trade exactly per your instructions in the last update and I tested it visually so I know it works fine.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
What can I say...After all, you have all the information that can be provided in less than 24hours of actual live testing and back-tests to support your theory.

Valiant effort Proximus ! I like how you call your system a gambling system. That word is taboo amongst most experts here at FF and elsewhere, due to what I surmise as it belittling their efforts at turning a profit in Forex. They very much prefer the word "investing" even though Forex is rarely considered an investing platform at the retail level. By acknowledging that you are gambling, albeit with sound mathematical reasoning, and willing to lose your entire account, you are open to a way of thinking not available to "investors." One thing to note is the eventual "trade of no return." I've seen plenty of backtests on systems like this. Your profit will grow and grow and grow until one day a trade takes months and months to return home. But then again you've already acknowledged this. Systems like this will return profit but will be inconsistent year after year. It may be obvious but I've noticed that the longer you hold out, the more likely you will run into a trade that doesn't return. You're a smart guy Proximus . I'm sure you can devise a strategy that allows you to cut out these rouge trades while still remaining solvent.

What's the current TP for the latest template? It was 10 pips, originally, and then I think it was changed to 3.5 pips. Rob

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Geez Prox, What happened to 10%/day? Maybe it will make the other 18% tomorrow?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
what happens if the price is constantly moving over the 30 MA .. does it not burn the account with spreads and false moves ?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Magix, your a naughty boy lol

--- 帖子 #84 ---
No because you don't open a new trade until the take profit on the previous trade is hit. So you just take a steady stream of profits. In theory...

i just try this system for scalping using M1 to entry.....but need to look at M5 , M15, M30 and H1 for trending. so far every trade that i take will hit my TP. thanks for a very profitable system.............

Hmm maybe we should keep a bit of leverage then.We need 1:10 to open a 0.01 with 100€ but, this way the margin requirement would be huge which would increase our chance of a margin call because we'd have less free margin. So because anyway we use tiny lot sizes to not get MC'd, we could aswell use larger leverage.I`m thinking between 1:100, and 1:200, besides the demo account has 1:100 leverage anyway. Not really, maybe i should redesign the system, for other pairs, to atleast get some swap bonus Its called adaptation to the market.While the system is in forward test, i`m still optimizing it for better outcomes, so the current best outcome is reached with 3.5 pips. Anyway thanks for the suggestions guys, i will think about them , and release a new version of the system.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
You are not finding better future outcomes ... but best past outcomes. Optimizing is a double-edged sword ...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I have 20 years of tick based historical data, 99.9999% accurate candlestick modelation.The fact that i run the system on 20 years of data gives me a very clear vision about the system.Its is highly unlikely that the market will change so drastically in the next few years, relative to the past 20 years. Markets usually have many cycles, and i`m very certain that it wont change drastically in the next 20-30 years, the last major change in the markets was the electronic trading which happened 40 years ago,the NASDAQ, i think we are safe for the next 30 years.The 2008 crisis was only a minor change if you think about it, not much changed in the price flow

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I agree ... but there's still no guarantee ... Never say never

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Nothing is certain in life. This system itself is no certain at all.Its a gambling system, and what we do is , we increase the odds to the maximum thats possible to achieve. Then only luck will separate the winners from the losers.But still the odds here will be higher than on the lottery or casinos

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Exactly.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Our new pair will be the AUD/USD, after careful considerations, i have found out that its the best pair for this system. The new strategy will be to enter only long on AUD/USD, since our probability wont be affected ,50% chance of getting it right (~49% if we count in the spread), so that would result in a small average loss which would slowly drain our account to 0. But ofcourse we use a 99.9999999% winrate strategy, but i`m just saying that it would work even with a 49-49 strategy (1% is always lost because of spread &amp; slippage) BUT , and this will change a losing system into a winning one.Everyone knows that the RBA gives bigger interest rate than the FED, so we can do carry trades.And since we only enter in long trades, we get 4.5 swap points on every long position at the AUD/USD (or atleast my broker gives that many points, it may differ on different brokers). Rollover on every midnight= (Swap rate/10,000) × Position × Number of days So for our position 4.5 /10000 * (1000 LOT UNIT) * DAYS You get that on every midnight if the position is still open, so Quoting handy148 are you factoring in swap given that some trades could be held for weeks/months even? After a month we get on each day (left column days, right column swap bonus in AUD): Attached File(s) SWAP BONUS AFTER 30 DAYS ON AUDUSD LONG.xlsx 9 KB | 310 downloads So after 30 days we get 209.25 AUD which is 136.24 € , given that we trade 0.01 lot size (1000 units ) only and start with 100€ account, thats a 136% growth in either way And thats the worst case scenario if we have a bad trade that we must hold for months. Of course the optimal situation is that we make 5-6% return/day depending on the markets ranging-ness. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Besides the AUD/USD was mostly in uptrend in the last 20 years, hmm maybe we even have an edge on long trades And the spread is still the best, from the pairs which can be carry traded, 13-14 pipette on average, so its worth a try What do you think guys?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I think you should consider volatility for what you are trying to do. Perhaps you want to look at the logic of if X trades does not come back in Y days, start trading Z pair. It's the only way you don't shut yourself down for extended periods if you get caught in a trade. Find a way to trade around a bad position. Lots of ways to do it depending on your risk and what you like to do.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I dont think thats a wise idea because our capital is locked in to that long trade.If we were to add more positions, and they would go against us aswell, that would double the chance for a margin call. Adding more positions or averaging is not very wise ,i`ve ran many simulations, and it all turned out even if i hedge the position it would still give us a MC. Retail traders just dont have the capital necessary for hedging effectively, and this system will try to minimize that risk.You dont want to risk a 50.000$ account on this strategy, because its a gambling anyway. Only start with a very small account you can easily afford to lose, and from there we must maximize our gains.With 5-6% / day its easy to reach 1 million $ in a year even with 100$ start And the losses are reduced to the bare minimum.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
You're better off setting your leverage high but only using 0.01 per 100 euros in your account. That way your margin requirement is low but you're not actually using excessive leverage. Long only on audusd, really?! It's interesting that Sony hasn't put a euro symbol on their Vaio on British keyboards yet. Do they know something we don't? ;-)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yes but we wont use 0.01 forever, it will increment anyway, with 0.5 account risk it will be a slow, but steady incrementation. Besides the broker has the right to modify the leverage at higher capitals, so its not very realistic to run a 1m$ demo account with 1:400 leverage or so.Nobody would give you that much, plus with higher capital, the lot will increase aswell so that will increase our risk of MC. So we should find a balance between this 2 problems: higher leverage to not pay so much margin requirement, but lower enough to lower our chances of MC when the lot will be incremented. Yes we will enter only long on AUD/USD when our indicator will tell us to, preferably after retracements.I will write the entire strategy detailed, but i`m still backtesting some configurations, it takes me hours to run a backtest (over 70 GB tick data i have only on AUD/USD)

--- 帖子 #99 ---
What is your plan if you buy the monthly high or sell the monthly low? Those are points in the chart where price is not going to come back. Happens every month.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
No we will use the same strategy, small trades with 40-50 pipette TP, but only trade in the LONG direction, and when the price goes agains us, we still get the swaps, because we were LONG. Its a win-win situation, only the MARGIN CALL can f*k us up Wait a little bit, i will soon write down the entire system detailed, but let me finish the backtests first.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Morning from UK, Hi Proxy. hope your are good. Have a good day. I am scalping today (working on a method) I tried something yesterday and was smashed to bits lol, be good

--- 帖子 #102 ---
hi proxy watching you and your thread closely right from the thread started. All the best for your new thought. I think there should also be many more statistical gambling trading method. i have started learning about them online and in my college library. hope even i get a system that is profitable .

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello Traders, I found this thread after trying the Holy Grail Indicator V1.6 found on Baby Pips and here at FF. I have 2 questions; 1) Is the original Goly Grail Indicator V1.6 being used and/or updated? 2) Where is the Gambling EA discussed in this thread for downloading? I would like to give it a try and what pair and t/f is optimum? Thank You and Regards, Cigarguy

--- 帖子 #104 ---
That was a total failure, i`m neither using that anymore or plan to update it, as i abandoned technical analysis for good. I have not released the EA for this system yet, but i will soon once i finish my backtests, i have to update the system aswell, so many new information since then, so i must update it.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Sorry to hear that. It sounded good at the beginning of this thread It appears that you are a good programmer

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I think you'd stand a better chance moving to a higher time frame and looking for a dynamic range. Your comprehension of the M1s is a little lacking and your idea of gains based on a generic position on any pair based on a single moving average are un-realistic. Catching the pinnacles of plays using this methodology are weak at best. If you are wanting to play in this playground working with a single Moving Average, it would be better applied through the use of CCI. Search the net, look for Woodies CCI and have a look at an actual strategy. After that... Begin to realize that BACK TESTS are worthless for the data they can provide on most time frames, ESPECIALLY the M1. These should be used to test to ensure your triggering, not for actual equity gains/curves. This is a journey here, prox. You have only taken one step.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Pardon me but how does exactly the higher timeframes help me.It doesnt matter on what timeframe i take the orders because the price moves exactly the same range on each timeframe. M1 helps us better visualization and helps manual traders catch the trade quicker. Yes if you have a piece sh!t historical data then it really is. If you data looks like this (for illustration purpose i used a very low quality M1 data for EURCAD, from you know where...): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then i`m really sorry for you. Its a worthless cr@p data. But if it looks like this, my ultra high quality tick data with 99.999% modeling quality: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then i think i can do high quality backtests on M1. NOTE that the time is set to january 2005.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Dude, seriously put him on ignore and stop wasting your time on him!! You need tick data really, but can't do that on MT4 so never mind.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
LOL that was tick data that i just shown. I think you dont know what tick data means.I think you meanT tick chart, because anyway the smallest TF on MT4 is M1, but the data can be tick based. The difference between tick data and m1 data is, that on tick data every tick is counted, while on m1 data 1 tick draws the entire candle and then closes, there is no movement between, meaning that the strategy tester on m1, will draw the candle after each minute passed, and draw nothing inbetween.Which is very incorrect representation.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
It's not real tick data is it, it just randomly uses High / Low then the close number to emulate tick data, maybe. Been years since I coded EA's 6+ I think, MT3 back those days. Your entries might aswell be random, it's all about huge SL and tiny TP!!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
And yet... HERE you are, missing about 19% off your statistical daily targets. You can continue to think that you know more...it is the market that is showing you otherwise. Pay ATTENTION! Do you seriously think that you are the first to try a system with a single moving average on any time frame? Are you really so naive to think that since interwebs trading has allowed folk to take part in markets and use automation that you are the first to have even tried this? Cummon. All this talk about how smart you are and you are still missing forest through trees.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi guys, back to bickering,,, erm one ema line is and has been standard for many years, be good, be nice, make love not war, not literally

--- 帖子 #113 ---
You need to apply context to this, billy. As applied here, and is plain to see, this is no more than a random market trigger, that is laggy. It's not bickering, turvy poking his nose into a conversation where he can add nothing, is just turvey showing his true trollish colors. Prox is simply ignoring the obvious in trying to prove merit to his claims. When you are NEW to market, this is what you do. This is something I have stated about his claims prior. By early next week, unless prox has scrapped this idea or implemented changes, there'll be only the sound of crickets and blowing tumbleweed in another dead FF thread. It is one thing to argue theory, but when you are arguing against the evidence you provide, it's pure arrogance. Nothing more.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
it is the way one speaks, Some people are good at teaching they possess the skills to understand,encourage, guide, assess and explain so that rules you out lol. I personally gave up with Proxy ages ago, I did try to help him but to no avail. I am not going to come into his thread and bs him. I will look and hope he gets his head together,I personally feel sad for his onlookers, There is not a holy grail but one can beat the market. I did and got out. be good trade well

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Before you come across with a blind sweeping statements like this, it'd be to your benefit to know what you are talking about. Much like newbies blindly assess market without proper DD, you have done the same in your analysis of my character. Bad form, billy. Bad form.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Its not randomly generated tick data, the random sticks are mostly on the first picture, but the real tick data is on the second EUR/USD picture. It is real tick data compiled into M1 candlesticks, i dont know whats so hard to understand about that. My entries are not the optimal yet so that needs a little bit of work for now.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Actually what he so far said to Proxy makes good sense...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
It's an example of no SL trading, or huge SL compared to tiny TP, which is what we need around here, as everyone seems to be on the no SL band wagon and there all going to get on really well, then lose it all in no time! It's entry is random, but no more so than anyone elses around here entry, so it's a good example. A the title says, NO EDGE so perfect.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Of course not, but its not the MA which is the center of attention here, but the SL and TP. The entry is pretty much random, thats it, i dont believe in technical analysis so doesnt matter if i use a STOCHASTIC or PSAR or RSI or whatever, its all nonsense. But the size of SL and TP optimized can increase the efficiency of this system. And also dont ignore the fact that its a gambling system, not a holy grail nor a "forever profitable system" It is designed to gamble, and if you are lucky then you can make money with it.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Can we get back to business (aka Thread subject) and leave those arguments for other. There are people here interested in this, at least I am. And don't worry, I'm responsible and only using money I can afford to lose...thanks!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I was getting worried you was taking this to seriously for a while then!!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Depends, how you define serious.The name of the thread says "gambling" and "no edge", and because of this it should be treated as such. It is not much better than a roulette or a slot-machine.But still i am trying to make the odds better. In the long term it will definitely lose you more cash than you make, so its not good to use it for a long time.But in the short term, it can make money, preferably make you more money than you need and can quit trading after. But at the end it all comes down to luck, nothing more, and only luck will separate those who will make money and those who will wipe out their account.Its a very high risk system, but the rewards can be nice aswell

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry Proxy, as soon as you said 95% win rate then you said you cannot lose I got somewhat interested lol. This sort of thing can be traded as well as magix threadbut ideally you need 2 accounts and blend them together, I just stuck 3 trades in Simple Strategy room this was compounding plus an easy entry system, its just following the big boys, be good

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Well aslong as your having fun, hopefully learning something and not losing too much money, then it's all good!!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
99.99% but it's risking everything almost, cause he has got a far out SL, not to sure how far out.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
lol what 4.99%. its like martingale 100% win rate

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I never said you cannot lose, but the chance of a loss is very tiny, yet 1 loss can wipe out the entire account. I thought thats obvious, because we are stopping only at a margin call, which is 95% of the account lost. Even the chances are tiny, it can happen, but hopefully we get rich before that. I also suggested to withdraw money frequently, but only the profits, not the initial account. With these methods its safer, but the odds are still 50-50, hopefully with the AUD it will be better. Its a gambling system.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Sadly never a 100% cause then it would work, it's the 0.01% which sooner or later will catch you out every time

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I agree but you state odds so surely this isn't gambling. Seriously , you are spending lots of time on a gambling strategy when infact you should be trading properly. But hey ho you are keeping the FF myths alive

--- 帖子 #130 ---
In fact I'd say he should be learning properly as before one starts trading he gotta know how to trade...

--- 帖子 #131 ---
He's having fun, messing with code and stuff, leave him be. Suspect he's after a quick turn nothing into something account booster, some times you've got to go high risk and take your chances.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
But then again trading (normally) can be regarded as a gamble. Proxy, why do you not just trade off that boob pattern use a massive stop loss or none at all and double up on any loss and to be more excentric compound the winnings or a percentage, This is a good way

--- 帖子 #133 ---
MT4 is lacking a boob pattern indicator strangely!! Doubling up, is martingaling then you can't take as big a move against you so it'll just be over quicker!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Martingale is solely for idiots, I did say doubling up to keep it easy, The big boys adjust their trade sizes it is standard practise. it is also useful to have a massive bank roll so you can play the game properly. Get into a trade and if it doesn't go according to plan a good trader can with the right experience can trade it back to good. it also helps to have an extensive statistic bank and play some decent music

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I am consistently AMAZED with people that have zero information or relevant data posting opinions as they are authority. You picked a good place for this talk, billy. But again...bad form.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
explain please

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Times up,,, I have seen throughout my life many times where people take a loss whether it be horse racing, tennis ,roulette etc you name it , they then double up on another race etc, this is MARTINGALE, the odds are stacked against you. If you have a good trading method with a good profitable strike rate it is ok to double up or add in to, this is not Martingale

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I mean... Rather than actually add to content, you side with popularity on a subject that you can neither quantify nor statically prove. Thus, the spread of misinformation on this site, spreads like WILDFIRE! Your words, much like this thread are completely out of context. Martingaling is a valid and profitable system, but must have restrictions and is only viable during certain market criteria. But like the thread title...yours is another blind sweeping general statement, without merit, to be included with the popular kids. Again, since this thread is based loosely on colored bubbles, you can actually go on with another baseless claim. Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
we actually do have the same idea regarding martingale, but perhaps we will never see eye to eye do to you not being a trader. Some things need not be explained due to being basic but I do try to show people to open their minds to a different approach to trading

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Pretty much what I was saying many times here... P.S. Never thought I share some ideas with Magix...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Mikk, When presented with actual information, similarity of opinions is an expectation, not exception. Keep on, keepin on, Mikk. You're coming along nicely!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Before magix put in his theory on martingale I did post my thoughts on it and they are the same as his. But it saddens me to see people trying to trade a method with BIG ideas but can this be done realistically using money. can it sustain you to live off. As for Proxy, I think he is one fine dude with a flair for adventure, he'd be a great pirate or explorer and he is so full of jest (aha I bet you thought I'd say shit) anyway I told him I'd share a few thoughts on his gambling thread as I went through that phase, I must admit they are a big seller though, Be good trade well

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I said yesterday that smoke is coming. It has already come. Keep on the fighting.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
lol, same person doing it. Nice return you have

--- 帖子 #145 ---
That's all good but if I were him I'd prefer to get valid information and use it. Trading ain't that easy to lose precious time having fun. It's business - for money firstly. Nothing wrong with you messing around charts if retired - he's not. LOL Oh yeah - you won your bet The only thing that I see as 'negative' about you is that you couldn't recognise the overwhelming stupidity of Turvy. And that's what I'm cautious about...

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I agree, are you speaking about magix or Proxy. That's is why I have already offered to help him after he has tried trading this method

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I already said that I agree with Magix. Proxy needs to learn - not at all keeping on with what he's currently into...

--- 帖子 #148 ---
lol, I was adding input. How many people watching will be thinking and hopefully check out PAST LEVELS, hopefully mainly hourly - daily Price predictability thread, I did ask questions but never got a satisfactory answer but I did have input made trades just for them but alas it seems a lot of people like doing grid no stop loss,stop loss ,holy grail , pooh in the pan ALL synonyms of LOSER, be good friend, I will help you if you ask, be good, do not ruin Poxys thread

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Proxy, to keep you informed.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) oil chart, circled are indecision times, and line is a level. I have zoomed out a lot so you can see. These can be traded and they go for hundreds of pips. even with no stop loss if you are with the trend. no grid no adding to, just plain going with the big boys edit time,,,, these indecision times are similar to your boob method,, I omit from commenting on volume due to it being in the brokers hands but I reckon if you stick with same broker volume kindie it can be worked

--- 帖子 #150 ---
add on,, the chart I just posted , the horizontal lines on it are for my benefit as I am doing a scalp as we speak.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I was in an oil scalp not long ago and for some reason the trade was closed but not by me. SPOOKY, I was long at the time and not actually making anything AND looking at the oil chart we have a long area of nothing happening WHICH MEANS (even my dog knows) SOMETHING WILL BREAK

--- 帖子 #152 ---
After every nothing, there will ofcourse be something, the question is, which direction ??

--- 帖子 #153 ---
pause.PNG which direction you ask T, I have no idea. One would assume it will follow the trend (easy) failing that set your entry high/low plus a few pips if needed then go for it. But if you don't have a stop loss it wont matter because if it goes ape one day it will return. like haleys comet

--- 帖子 #154 ---
that oil chart, if it goes for a few hours with being flat hopefully an inside bar would appear and then I would of traded off it not too long ago, the trend is up but we talking oil so it isn't a certainty, maybe a short time frame will give a clue before the hourly chart gets a trigger

--- 帖子 #155 ---
M15 trend might get you a 60% win rate, but if you smart and get in low of the nothing area you could have quite a small SL, making the R:R very nice indeed. .,

--- 帖子 #156 ---
T , yes indeed Attached Image (click to enlarge) this chart on hour time frame, we actually do have an inside bar BUT was it breached??? the following bar was exactly level with the mother bar. Some traders perhaps would of traded it aggressively for a short perhaps even me at one time, but without the stats I would wait for it to be visually seen chart is OIL edit again, AND it is over bought and between 2nd and 3rd resistance not that that ever bothered me lol. the pc would of picked up on it though

--- 帖子 #157 ---
It's going up mate, end of story, look for a place to join it where your SL is acceptable and job done. Your putting to much faith in candles there, KISS baby!!

--- 帖子 #158 ---
sorry bud, but one fails to agree with thee. I was long earlier before it was closed but that is now history. I do keep it simple. a candle is a candle. open-close-high-low uk time. My old pc software could make its own candles , smart thing.. I can predict though that it will go higher I cannot say when, it only needs to drop say 20 pips and that is ok with me and what ever it does after that is the future.. We shall see what happens edit.. anyway nothing has been triggered yet re oil. How about if we long and short it at same time lol

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Prox Thanks for the information you provided, I am putting my own flavor on your system (including a SL), and so far so good, will continue to forward test. Unfortunately, I find nothing else of interest to me here, so time for me to move on. All the best to you and all other traders in here. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ok i will simply ignore the last 63 posts where you guys were bickering eachother. Now lets get back to business.Yesterday i had some important thing to do, do i had no time to respond.But still finished the backtest and i came to a crossroad. We have to take a choice: -Either we go with the AUD pair to do the carry trade strategy, which would be fine, but unfortunately the AUD is trending way too much, so the chance of margin call with my strategy is almost tripled.So not very nice.We either have to put a damn stop at lets say, 2-3 days high or low? Or - We stay with the EUR/USD, where the chance of a MC is very low, but we lose money if we hold the trade too long because the swaps are negative in either direction on the E/U. Or Other solutions. Now guys please help, because its a big dilemma, so we have to put our heads together if we want to make something out of it.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Understood Mikkk01 . Sometimes people just have to live and learn. But you and I both know Turveyd is not going to give in. Best to just walk away sometimes. No offense Turveyd . Stage is yours Prox .

As I promised I won't try to persuade you until you reach the stage when you're ready to accept facts which don't coincide with what you currently believe but you'd better read last 63 posts [counted? lol] - maybe you'll finally come to terms with some points... I won't write anything related to him if he doesn't give more misleading info. I don't do it for him - other people like Proxy can buy his crap and then just lose a great lot of time figuring it out. Good to see you understand. I hope Proxy will also...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Wtf guys, when i log in i see how many new posts have been made in my thread, didnt you think that i counted them all? I just saw the usual bickering and i was tired to read them. Hey i`m not a grandmaster trader, neither you are, so i still believe the collective minds can bring us better ideas than i myself alone. Besides this thread is to discuss the system, if i could do it alone, then i would never opened this thread in the first place, just trade alone and cash in the big bucks while you guys would still only bicker eachother. Open for suggestions. I put forward 2 possible outcomes, help me choose the best one.Or give me alternative ideas. I`m really tired of nonproductive posts, i want some progress on the system which improves it.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I have a question too, Prox. Have you studied risk management? I like what you are doing here in a least trying to get some actual data in place. It will help you immensely, as you will stop repeating mistakes. We need to discuss risk management. Just so you know, I don't place stops in the market either.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I learned my basic knowledge mostly from there.I was trading before that, but that was more like a game rather than serious trading. If i were, do you think i`d be sitting here talking with you? As a matter of fact, i dont think your are either consistently profitable, if you were, you should be now on holiday in Bahamas.Not wasting time on big newbies like me hmm? You talk like if you were some grandmaster trader who can make billions daily, but reading your posts, doesnt show any trading wisdom at all.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I have good holidays when on holidays. I don't really like beach tours - I prefer going to US. Your illusions about billions are just ludicrous. Same goes for assumption that a man can't afford going to Bahamas if he doesn't trade successfully let alone participating in a forum. As for my profitability: I post trades on a daily basis. Some live. Really: to say anything at all in this matter... Back to suggestions. If you're not profitable what makes you think that you know any better? My posting history may be not that long but fuck... I don't advise you to follow me - there're some successful long term members around. You'll never hear anything remotely close to what you currently think is verity. But you gotta put in efforts to identify who's worth trusting. You see now Turvy who's desperately trying to make you believe him - make your choice. And I don't really care what it'll be as it doesn't affect me in any way. Wanna listen - go ahead, don't wanna - up to you...

Hi guys, hope everyone is good. I see no Proxy so I shall leave. I just posted 3 compounds in Simple Strategy room, and before the baying dogs start to snarl with ridiculous analysis of hey man it doesn't seem to flow in a compound way, well it does if iexplained, which I wont. be good and catch you later

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Proxy, instead of trying to get an ea to fit your trades, actually this is aimed to any ea traders. EA hardly ever works , a couple of trades you'll gain due to the odds but how about approaching your boob method in a different way, ie using them as triggers plus you can even incorporate a grid type system

--- 帖子 #171 ---
e/u is in a nice indecision area and the oil hasn't shifted YET, add on e/j is indecision too update, 20 minutes later e/j has dropped just over 20 pips from that indecision area

--- 帖子 #172 ---
This is not true. You have nothing supporting your claim and can't prove it. He needs to get the hang of it without this stuff first. And that doesn't mean 2 days backtest. Actually U pattern is the only his idea that makes some sense...

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I agree for most of it, First thing being the market doesn't do as you would think .. second thing,,, don't think or assume. I am sure we will get him into a trader

--- 帖子 #174 ---
But you just said EAs don't work... I don't think what market will do - I think what I can do about it. Only on the condition that he starts accepting facts which contradict his current beliefs and comes to terms with the fact that a man saying 'you're right' ain't always right...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
That's true.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
yep, trade was posted in Simple strategy room, 3 trades compounded. start from 1 again

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Using my Trade Explorer on your thread? This is total Bullshit!! FALSE ADVERTISING!!! Thread SCAM ALERT!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Huh, scam alert... He'll probably drop a line, we'll see...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
motley crue music has now been turned off, It was beginning to do my head in, got classical on now, Grieg piano concerto I assume Proxy would like e/u to go down, it seems to be wanting to go north out of the indecision area

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Mikkk01 , As is with commodities, do you not believe mean reversion exists with Forex; at least for the major pairs Proximus is trying to "trade"? Yes, the mean moves but not in the short term, not immediately. The problem with this system is when the mean does move and the system gets stuck in a trade it could possibly implode. If he can find a way to cut these "danglers" as I call them, why can't the system succeed? However, to do this would require thinking outside the norm. No 1:1 RR, no tight stop loss, no 1% of account wagered. In my opinion, that is why most newbies fail; because they follow those re-hashed guidelines without knowing what they are in for. This is just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
good post, THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX you just nailed it. Short term this is a crazy way to trade (in my humble opinion) plus it is fast trades.. Speaking totally gambling ,a way to off set the loss would be to counter trade the trade with a higher pip value and it will even the trade out and even make pips. It is just to trade with the big boys. I I do not mean trade a pair long and short at the same time like the idiots do or try and hedge, call it a new method to trade

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Good to see you at least don't claim anything saying 'I'm smartest'. Point is: it's reasonable to change something in behaviour overall if what one is currently doing haven't brought him profitability - and that's not at all system-jumping [exactly what he and turvy do], on the opposite - just cease of insisting on always being right despite the results suggesting otherwise.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Agreed.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Maybe he has a point there. I was thinking about the boob method, but i find that correlated with economic news aftershock.I currently use that system, it defines well a rejection of news of some sort, the late-traders trying to push the price back to the equilibrium state. Besides i have many more systems other than this one, you dont have to worry about me I can work simultaneously on more than 1 things Agreed, EAs do work. And grid systems dont work they are BS. Wtf you want with the oil The oil always have an upward bias, it would not be so hard to trade that. I`m more interested in the gold now, i heard rumors that the gold will rise again soon after the aftershock of this bearish sentiment will be gone. So it would be wise to go long as soon as major news like Bloomberg TV or other sources will tell you too. The major lesson i learned in the last 4 weeks or so is that technical analysis is BS. I pay more attention to fundamentals now.And try to quantify that, that is my main system now.Besides i have a little background in macroeconomy I was very much inspired in trading by the Wallstreet movies. Remember this quote: "The most valuable commodity I know of is information." --Gordon Gekko

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Proxy, you just did it again , just listen.. OIL has a bias IT WILL ALWAYS GO UP, every day their is less of it. But it is harder to trade it than you think.. How many people do you see in these chat rooms say OH I BEEN WRITING EAs for years etc, how many trading systems on the market selling EA based systems. Think about it. be good boob method,, forget about news just have it all logged down in your stats.. I bet when you back test a method news never comes into it, simple. I am not trying to be negative

--- 帖子 #186 ---
So now it's pretty obvious why Turvy failed miserably while many other traders managed to succeed wasting years less by just embracing the philosophy 'I can't know it all' and identifying what is worth listening to. That's it. Take good stuff, dump crap. If one dumps everything he'll never do it as he ain't profitable by default and never will be cause he won't change anything.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
You'd better decide already who you're gonna listen to as what we say is incompatible. The fact that you couldn't yet recognise how dumb he is makes me wonder...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Yes of course it cant go always up, people take their profits or hit SL and then price usually retraces, not all traders go long, otherwise how could the market function, there must be short traders too. But the point is that the sentiment is bullish on the oil, because there is less and less in the planet of it.Ok maybe sometimes new oil fields are discovered, resulting in a bigger supply usually driving its price lower temporarly. But in general the sentiment is always bullish but especially when the USD is bearish.The sentiment should be more important for long term traders. I dont know your trade style, if you are scalping oil on 1M then its really sad, but if you trade it wisely on D1 or W1 charts then you are a pro @ EAs, ok i`m not saying all EAs work, but the EA term in general is very effective. If you can automatize your system, its the best thing possible, its trades faster, more accurately and more reliably than a human. Plus you can leave it on overnight while you sleep and generate $$$ for you. Its very advantageous, and also eliminates emotions. @ my pattern, the problem with the boob pattern is that, it usually happens after news, its just a retracement after a period of indecision, but the retracement to be long and valid it must be triggered by a huge outbreak. I dont think we can quantify that without considering the fundamental factors too Which i just cant ignore anymore ,sorry

--- 帖子 #189 ---
That's pathetic. You can't learn such a thing in 4 weeks but can easily learn the opposite in a couple of days reading threads with live trades based on technical data...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Actually i agree with many stuff that he said.We both dont believe in technical analysis , which is already a huge step towards succes. Now i dont care if you say he wasted 9 years, so what i wasted 1.5 also, not that much as him but hey, not all people learn equally fast. No trader can become succesful overnight, some people need more time than others.I was lucky that i had programming skills and i could write indicators, ea's and other C# based softwares that could increase my research speed by atleast 200% Without those skillls i would probably needed a few more years too for my enlightment.I was more enhanced and lucky sort of. --------- On the other hand, you and magix still use BS indicator systems that are for no use and dont give any sort of edge. I mean seriously, do you think that genesis system of yours can make you consistent profit, how much exactly (average) monthly increase can it make? I`m curious, tell me ?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Ok i removed it, i just wanted to compare our TE's results.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Because you are without the ability to understand price in relation to the smoothing of indicators, doesn't mean they don't work. Just means that you haven't educated yourself to their merits Because I have the ability to teach people the value and merits of indicators, only means that I have a better understanding of what they are saying. You have no idea how or what I use to trade. I have a few posted from yesterday evening. Tell me again how better your market idea is again? HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE HERE And please tell me why, without permission, you feel that it is alright to bolster your dogshit thread by applying my TE stats. You can slink around with other trolls and newbies and shout out that others are the same, but you should at least have an idea of what you are talking about. .

--- 帖子 #194 ---
that is more or less what I said,, it goes up ,each day less of it. scalping oil on 1 min is stupid but one can see levels happening and of course have pc set to trade spikes. I wouldn't let fundamentals bother you too much, it is one more burden to carry

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I just re read this post... oil you got right, each day their is less EVERYTHING ELSE you said is just pure shit sorry. I told you I no longer trade for a living but the last week I have just been playing, you could probably tell me to trade any pair and I would make a profit with it (fast mover) yes I am dick measuring but I have learned the skill to trade, and yes I listened to everyone no matter of their experience. So where do you go next, just try listening

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Proxy,,, why not change your pair to usa oil,,, every one knows it'll go up unless they manage to mine kryptonite,

--- 帖子 #198 ---
can we speak about trading if not can we speak about Proxys method. To be honest I have not read how he trades it as they do not work. I am here to help Do I assume once the ea is broken you trade that direction and what happens when it goes against you I just cannot believe I am asking these questions I should be out speaking to the trees

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Proxy, how about trading the oil, long it until the next daily level which is about 250 pips away edit,, it might level off in approx. 100 pips from now.. I am not saying it'll do it straight away but oil is oil

--- 帖子 #200 ---
so e/u is showing signs of levelling off, just suppose it goes down will Proxy be adding into a another short, or what happens if it keeps going north. It can go either way for apprx 2000 pips

--- 帖子 #201 ---
so what about trading

--- 帖子 #202 ---
For the people viewing who maybe new to trading. Gambling is stressful... Please note ... I am asking questions...NOTICE I never get an answer

--- 帖子 #203 ---
lol, e/u levelling off and oil on 15 min chart. Hopefully for Proxy it'll drop , other than that watch the break

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I think proximus chances of this coming back are very high,if by chance this was a long position he would be in far more trouble.personally if I was to adopt a trading style such as this ,I would look more at the longer term swings for stop placement .this may increase the stops but would increase less chance of wipe outs. proximus is a maths guy who understands stochastic probability and the various reference to martingale,especially super martingale which does actually have a positive outcome.the crunch being there is no stop point .if I was prox I would work on the stop point to bend the maths in his favour.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I agree with your post yet disagree. When I was trading full time I only ever traded e/u e/j sometimes g/u and very rare a/u and OIL nothing else. I would view a chart mainly 15 min, 1 hour, daily and check daily ranges. and then trade what was happening NOW. Indeed e/u could drop 2000 points or rise 2000 I would never think about things like this but if it did drop or rise I would be with it.. I lived and breathed probabilities, percentages, statistics this leads me to Proxy, something does not add up, I am saying this respectfully but he may know maths, probability but he doesn't know forex trading. Several people have tried to explain but failed and look what happens, the thread gone ape. edit,,, could one live off this method, I know it is labelled as gambling but your views. and I mean in England or usa another edit, I dislike the word martingale, but it can be used as I have spoken about in the past

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Prox, for all we know, may have just sold the YEARLY bottom. Perhaps he will tell us what he plans to do about that.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
??? I am not sure what you are getting at. If he is trading this method bottom/top means nothing the trades will continue just like yours. anyway lets move on, these sorts of methods are fun but fail. If you have a good run and perhaps get a holiday or a bike/car out of it and then call it a day then you have done well. If done occasionally this could be used in trading even martingale but alas doomed to failure, be good bud. Think outside the box

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Before you arrogantly diss and/or dismiss any system merely on the basis that it uses indicators, you need to learn the system. That is the only way that you can make such a judgement, and even then, the judgement will not be 'whether the system works or not,' but it will be 'whether it works for you ' or not!!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
hi bud, he is still learning but with time he should improve, a bit like my wifes yappy jack Russell dog.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hey there billy.....learning requires one to close ones mouth, and open ones ears and mind!!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
lol, I have also told him many times in here and so have many others, to listen, ask questions but what can I say?. He reminds me of my little girl except she could trade , but the rest of time I think she lives on a different planet, I can tell her something and she doesn't accept it, all basic things. be good bud

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Billy. You use a lot of words to never really say anything. You are almost like turvey, but without the dunce cap. Though you seemingly have a great story, you also seemingly sit on the fence on almost everything that is put before you. You do as much to confuse new to market as you you do to help. Which leads me to only one conclusion. You too, don't know your ass from a hole in the ground. Sure, everybody can play momo. That is seemingly all you have. Not saying it like it is a bad thing. It's just really weak and very cliché. When price is going up. Buy. When price is going down. Sell. This is seemingly your only message, only your delivery, albeit really poorly spelled and punctuated, is well...weak. RJ put it kindly and is a reiteration of what I have said. If you have no idea of the subject you are speaking, it best you shut the fuck up, and start listening. Otherwise, you just come off as sounding like another fucking know-it-all, who still doesn't know-anything. Tap out buddy. or Toe the fucking line. Your posts are getting as intolerable as the rest of the FF Tweets.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Sorry for my arrogancy, its more like critical thinking.I just had my experience with those kind of systems, and i can now generalize it and put each one of them in the trash. What do you mean "does it work for me" ? What kind of BS is that. The question is weather it works objectively or not, you put on some indicators, which everyone else who uses them puts on, and then either all of you make money with it , or none of you make money with it .I think its the last one. All of you use the same exit,entry positions, so why the f. should people get different results using it, explain it to me?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Apologising for your arrogance, and then immediately continuing with it makes your apology (which i would have accepted) a load of bollocks. No, you can't. In your 5 minute FX career, you have just wanted to act and sound like 'the man', when you actually know jack shit......as demonstrated by the quote above. You have dissed the Genesis System, and like Turveyd, you have zero experience of it, it's workings or anything. As I said to him, to just make a blanket sweeping statement about a system that you have zero knowledge and experience of just shows how an idiot you are. Only fools and politicians criticize something they don't have any experience of!! Once again you show your arrogance and ignorance, and aptly demonstrate that you have zero knowledge or understanding of something that you diss and criticize!! The system is not like your two bit EA....'either it crosses a line or it doesn't....yes or no....black or white.....iow a boolean system. The system, like most systems, have a degree of discretion with which the user must apply his FX experience, knowledge and skills to, in order to make a successful entry, select the appropriate SL position and set a target, but at the same time be aware of the ebb and flow of the market and be ready to exit if the target looks out of reach. If it was as black and white as you think, then there would be no need for any system at all.....we would just use an EA instead. Using the turn indicator in your car, assuming you're old enough to drive, does not mean that you ARE going to make the turn. It signals your *intention* to turn. FX indicators are much the same, they give a heads up of what is likely to happen, not what is going to happen.....that's where the discretion in any system comes into play. That is also why I might make consistent gains using a system that I have used and studied for several years, and you, with your 10 minutes of reading the first post, WILL lose!! If trading was a simple as you seem to think it is, then i would be a very rich man indeed. Now, before you reply to me, drop the attitude and show a little respect.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
When he sells or buys he is going take a trade that is not going to back for the rest of the year. That is why these methods fail. As far as thinking outside of the box, there is nothing you or I have thought of that has not been thought by someone else. This is not string theory, it's forex.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I have noticed that most of the posts from billy are needlessly cryptic. But he is stat averse, much like turv is.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
That sentence just answers that i wanted to hear from you.The fact that you are not rich after xyz years doing it, shows that the system is of no use. Sorry i dont meant to be rude in either of my posts, but thats the truth.Trading is by boolean logic, either you make money or you dont , nothing complicated. The fact that you try to dress trading in another costume than which it really is, just shows inexperience.I`m sorry for you guys.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
You are right, i should have programmed the EA to not sell near yearly and not even monthly high and lows. I wil try to fix that soon.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
You are a first class, A grade idiot......and you're NEVER going to make it the FX world....even after you have got through adolescence. You have no idea of my financial situation, nor am I going to tell you about it. Suffice to say that my life is quite comfortable, thank you. Indeed, trading might be boolean, but that is not what I said. I said that any given system is not boolean, if it was, we would just have EA's and nothing else. Reading comprehension isn't your strong point either is it? Without a system, it's a one way trip to see mister margin call...pdq. However, your mickey mouse EA is in a stupid drawdown and cannot take another trade until the price returns (which it may or may not do) or you close it in the red. Meanwhile I'm happily trading and making profits, as are many others on the Genesis thread as witnessed by the LIVE trades and winning trades posted from the history feature of MT4. There are many other systems here that are making money while you're watching your single underwater trade. Really easy to see who the inexperience one here is.....he's the one looking at you in the mirror.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Good luck with that. Maybe if you used the prior month H/L you could do something with it. Prox. EA trading is for fun. If a bot is ever built that can beat the market, the market would change in some rather fundamental ways, not to mention the fact that it's creator should very much fear for their well being. The very best EA is your mind. Stop trying to automate, and use the talents that you have, and you do have penchant for methodical thinking. Lastly, most veteran traders are real dicks. Do not let that stop you from learning from them. They are dicks because they earned what they know. They earned with screen time, learning to program, learning statistics, and learning psychology. If someone says you are full of shit, do not take that personally. You can get this Prox, but first you have to confess to being a student. The teachers will come after that.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Making money is complicated. Ask yourself this. How much money do you want to make this month? After you have that answer, ask yourself, how do you plan to make that happen? Let's start with these two things.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks for advice jmn5611. Now i cleaned the thread from the trolls Have you seen the latest extracted posts,they've gone way too offlimits in that last bickering, i had to ban turvey and mikk from this thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...83#post7233583

morning guys have a good day

This will be my last post to you magix or my pet name for you is Pinocchio. I have put serious input into this thread, how many times have I said a pair is levelling off INDECISION. You trade by buying and selling a pair AT THE SAME TIME and you call me. I turned £100 into £700 in 2 weeks playing... Your 1st lesson. Shall I help you onto a chair. Using 1 pair ,BUY when it goes UP and SELL when it goes down. I repeat once more, using one pair BUY when it goes UP and SELL when it goes DOWN NOT BUY AND SELL SAME PAIR AT THE SAME TIME, lol I do make errors typing but it is normally due to me being on mobile. Be good take and once more Using one pair BUY when it goes UP and Sell when it goes down EASY, that's a good boy, get down now and try a trade... Check SIMPLE STRATEGY room I put my trades in there[attach]1355068 Say again Pinocchio oops I mean Magix are you a trader

--- 帖子 #226 ---
JMN this is last post I write to you, You too buy and sell the same pair at the same time, so please do not have a go at me. Go to SIMPLE STRATEGY room and see my trades. I do believe that you may of found the holy grail regarding your TE, You are nearly 2% up by buying and selling a pair at the same time, well done I wish I could shake your hand. Anyway lesson time ,Shall I lift you onto a chair, oh you can sit next to magix... 1st lesson,,,,Using 1 pair BUY when it goes UP and SELL when it goes down. once more, you too can join in Magix BUY when it goes UP and SELL when it goes DOWN, SEE that's easy, ok boys get down now and trade, and put your trades in SIMPLE STRATEGY room with mine, be good bud Attached Image JMN, just once more and speak the truth, tell me are you a real trader

good idea Proxy

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Proxy, I just pinged you

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Proxy, your gambling method as a bit of fun, Can you not try muscling your way back into a trade . I do not mean it as short and long at same time as a method as this fails but make a counter trade off a high probability entry, I used to do something like this years and years ago edit,, it would help having a big bank roll to play with

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I am in a e/j scalp but system has crashed and I cannot close trade, lol edit, 10 mins later .I was 20 pips up then it dropped down to 10 pips and still I cannot close trade, It would be good if this went in my favour

--- 帖子 #231 ---
If I were you I would also ignore someone who makes a lot of posts on your thread, none of which are relevant to your system and most of which are just about himself. Apart from this disruption, you have the makings of a good thread. I'm interested to see where you are going with this experiment.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Great!!!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
You mean billy? Nah, he may have unusual methods to express himself, but he is a good guy.His posts make sense, and he never started any bickering in any thread around here that i have seen. He also shows a higher level of experience in trading which is highly appreciated. As for offtopic, hey, we need that too, to keep the mood good in this thread. ______________________-- Getting back to topic, i was thinking about this system today, and i think it would be a nice idea to use the bollinger band again. But not for placing stops, but for filtering out the tops and bottoms. The outer ranges of the BB shows levels of price where the price is the most unlikely to go, so we can use them as a MONHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY MAXIMUM HIGH/LOW detector, so to not commit the same mistake as i did by selling at an the monthly low. What do you think guys?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I can't help on choosing the right BB settings but this seems a good idea, you could put the EA off when the price is near the lines and only trade on a safe area...

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Considering I am the one with a TE linked to a live account, and you are the one posting ex post facto charts, it is I who should be asking you who the trader is. Right now, all you have is talk. How about you link a TE so we can really see what it is that you claim to do, instead of doing all this yapping. Without an objective arbiter, you can post your winners and hide your losers. That will not do, billy, man up or shut up.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Okay, that's a start in an effort to analyse your problem, but what would your trade trigger be? What is your criteria for determining whether or not you have a reversal off the band?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Turv is lucky he his still a member of FF. Making death threats is illegal. It is clear you trying to build your grail. Which means all we can do is ask you questions for you to think about.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes Turv just pushed the outside the limits this time, so i dont want my thread to be polluted with such conversation.If you look at my posts, i never insulted anybody during my presence at FF,even when i was mad i tried to be polite, yet many of the guys did insulted me.So that is why i banned realjumper too. ________ Of course, asking questions is nice, and it helps anyone of us to think about solutions to this problem, but no bickering and trolling. The trigger is the same, buy/sell near the MA, when it crosses it from above or below.But the fillter was a bigger issue, we dont want to buy at alltime high or sell at alltime low We must avoid that.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Okay, so we have a trigger and a filter. What if the trade goes against you anyway? Do you wait it out, dig out, or close it?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Proxy, your gambling method.. what time chart are you looking for, meaning, Are you happy getting one trade per day or maybe a trade every few hours .

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Try not to let your head be turned by all the incoming praises.... I have my first turn wrestling with programming the MT4 platform last night. I got it so messed up That I had get rid of the whole and down load a new one. When I got all fifteen screens back up and running ( a Template helps but only a little) and loaded up some pending trades, I neglected to check the Lot size(!) Around 4 in the morning I awoke to find myself in danger of a margin call! Naturally I woke up and started closing stuff I was hoping would come back into profit. I looked at the bottom, saw some things were making good money , and decided that collecting them might help the margin call thing anyway. When I went to close them out, I found I was trading full Lots! closed out the full lots, checked my pending trades, they were all in full lots as well! I have never traded in full lots before, and knew immediately this had to be stopped before I got killed, and closed out all of my pending trades as fast as I could. Net result: I lost some 11% of my account. I hadn't realize I had grown it enough to support a full lot bid! so I looked around then and this morning, and realized at the rate I had been making money, I would make this back in 6, 7 weeks. I increased my take profit window, I had found out that I made just as much money , and did not have to work so frenetically to do it. Good thing I woke up. A margin call is a terrible thing. Good and safe now, though. I follow your posts, and billytt's with interest.

Rap, I was speaking to a guy about your parent child philosophy and he was studying that sort of thing, he might be in touch (FF subscriber). I have spent yesterday and today watching charts (sad) specifically looking at your families (parent child) 2 go up one goes down, one goes up two go down zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz then bingo two go up one goes up, CORRECTION TIME. You are on to something. Like I said weeks ago some of this movement is retained in sub conscious mind but if you can get it plotted that'll be ever so good. Proxy, I know this post isn't related to your method but it adds knowledge

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thats a dilemma, and a pretty big one The solutions could be: A) Wait it out : not good for EUR/USD, the best pair which has many ranging periods , so has a very low probability of failing the trade, however if we do, the wait-out would cost us dearly, by paying the swaps. Good for AUD/USD, where we can certainly get extra swap bonus on long positions, but its a very trending pair with less ranging periods, so we will have a high probability of failing here. Prerry much a dilemma B) Dig it out: i suppose you mean to avoid it somehow, well, the question is how? Increased filter, but then we will have less trades. Or put a medium sized SL, in which case the 1 losing trade will have a large drawdown.Put a small SL, and then the system will no longer be gambling , but a conventional system. C) Close it: Thats nonsense, if we wait we either wait or we dont, by closing it we just ensure ourselves of the certainty of the loss, if we dont then atleast we have a remote chance that the price will come back. Now please choose/ vote on the best method, or give me suggestions guys.Any help is highly appreciated, I myself am in a big dilemma right now.

How about D. Hedging it? A good cross-currency hedge has made my trade come true often.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
C .. Hi Proxy, I personally would pick C and close the trade down, I answer as if I were in a trade myself and not gambling. other options for you would be to hedge hoping for a retrace or even trade the opposite direction again waiting for retrace, I would of done neither. The way I worked, if I were to be in a bad trade and hopefully waiting for a retrace that is wasted money, money that could be used on another trade for instance. Similar to property development , one buys a house with the view to selling it after refurbishing and suddenly the housing market becomes stagnant so what do you do...You Rent It Out so you are still making money.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
snap, lol edit,, that does make sense Rap. I personally only traded 3 or 4 pairs so I didn't have any stats to cross trade

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Proxy, if I know your preferred trading times I can look on my charts for entries and offer advice

--- 帖子 #248 ---
If you hyper qualify your trigger by filtering, you can increase the size of the range. In seeking out extreme conditions, market pivotal points, you will find yourself in a lot less positions, but with the possibility of an increased range of trade. 12 trades at 3 pips = 36 1 trade at 36 pips = 36. If you are looking at increasing the odds, you have to throttle back on the randomness of the trigger to actually play this statistically safe. IF WHEN and THEN. OR Even using something as mundane as an ADX for filtering the range on the M1 will give you a better probability of success on multiple trades than using one. There is also the addition of using overbought/oversold ranges from different periods. I have had some decent success with using the M5 chart to filter the M1. Working with an M5 bollinger band and only taking trades against it, can increase your chances of success, especially if you want to continue to work with a static range. If you move to a dynamic range, there is a lot that can be said for this too. Option E, could just run with the simple static range on a qualified filtered trigger and win or lose, close and reverse. If filtered properly, you should have a lot larger ranges for winners, but may have a lot of tiny losers. Because the idea is gambling, this would seem the most logical. End of the week, as long as you are ahead by a single pip, you have still beat the market for the week and live to fight the next. Just a couple thoughts for ya going into the weekend. Keep on chugging.

A few comments that are meant to help. You claim to be a fundamental trader, but for the last 48 hours, have ignored the fundamentals of the E/$. You have allowed a trade to move against you when the fundamentals underlying the euro were clearly long. Perhaps you need a rule that allows for a dump of any trade that is found to be counter to your analysis of fundamentals. Will your current situation resolve itself? Probably, but if you are not trading while it works itself out, your dreams of making a live as a trader is pretty much over. If you are still working off a 1M chart, perhaps you should bring up a 1H chart to gain some perspective of the market. Professional traders work off a 4H chart, entering and exiting on the 1H. I can't imagine how you develop perspective of the market, when to enter, etc. You need to understand that this experiment will end in failure, but you should learn a few things in the process, so it's worth the effort. I admire your effort, and doing it in view of the public takes guts, which earns you some help. Keep moving ahead and make sure you continue to document your thoughts here.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Well... I'm ready to put my money where my mouth is...easy to say, because I will be using a demo account. Not for the sake of comparing dick sizes, but in the spirit of the thread. I have, what I consider a high probability trigger, that I am willing to mix with my own concept as previously mentioned and will pick a single trade pair and a start account of $100 as the gambler. The trigger, I will not divulge, but the rest, I will. Rules of the trader will go like this: It will be a cost averaging trigger on grid EA. It will be a Dynamic Range trader, meaning it will continue to buy under criteria until a sell trigger is generated and vice versa. It will cost average trades incrementally. It will NOT use a STOP loss, but will still close trades with a negative value. I willingly allow Prox to link my EA to his thread for comparison. My choice of Crosses will be EURUSD and start lot size will be a dime. Cost averaged trades will be incremental to the primary lot. So, lot one=.1, lot two=.2, lot 3=.3 and on and on until close or bust! I have absolutely no conceptual idea if this will survive the week, but love the idea of the challenge.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Okay Prox, so how about breaking up your position size into smaller amounts and scaling in with the trend? Or, how about dynamic hedging? Honestly, if you really just want to gamble, you may as well just average down or do a direct martingale. That is as gambling as it gets!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I dont use fundamentals in this strategy.Maybe its a mistake, but just to keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Another question Proxy. How do you determine when a trend ends?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
With all due respect Magix, if you cannot show the trigger, do not use the EA. I think Proxy is trying to get his shit together, so we need be as transparent as we can. You are clearly a master at automation, can you whip up something that can help him, trigger included? Edit: I am not saying GIVE him anything, but maybe something that has a flaw, and we can help him discover it. Grails are very hard won, and he needs to find his own!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Master of automation...I am not... See, here's the thing... I don't know code, but I do know market. I have an idea that any single trigger and especially as applied to an M1 chart is destined to fail. Be it working with a stop loss or tight range for TP, there is the eventuality that they will all end up similar to how Proxies EA did this week. It's really more so a take on working a cost average concept and dynamic range that I think is the key to prosperity through a gamble and could quite conceivably be applied to any of the market systems or strategies that could be found here at FF. I don't know for sure that my EA will make it past Tuesday, let alone survive the week...but I'm willing to give it a shot. I am still development stages and have pieces of code that when afforded enough breathing room and equity have churned $10k almost 3 full spins last year. Real money, live accounts. Problem is, they require a large start account, a small lot size and can still hit high in the DD before coming back to square. Bottom line, they still make the cash, but what if I just want to throw a hunny into market and see what I could get out? Having an account that doesn't need a reload for the week following, running a grid, cost averaging EA with a $100 start would be decent...any profit over $100 retained by the end of the trial run, would be a success. We're not there yet. Until it is tested and proven, all it is, is an idea. Giving any information on it, simply wouldn't be of any value to prox nor anybody else... Look through the thread and see how many others will throw down an idea as to how to build the better mousetrap, but without any sort of conceptual idea or proof of success. Having gone down a lot of these same roads, all I am doing is, instead of just throwing in a blind sweeping statement or suggestion, is launching an idea of my own. Really, why should prox take my word over anything anybody else says? And why shouldn't he take all suggestions, add his own interpretation and see if they will stack up against others? This way, he keeps his focus, but still gains off of any statistical information that I can provide without having to commit a second thought. I have said before, that working with these is a long journey and as far as goes, me and prox alike are still only a step or two in.

Proxy, I did ask which time frame you preferred. You also mentioned BB and trigger, here is an idea for you to look at. Attached Image (click to enlarge) chart 22nd Jan,, E/U hourly, high lighted candle 13-00 uk time. candle closed past your BB moving average(black line) so next candle would of been trigger for long, would of made approx. 14 pips before dropping approx 40 pips and then going up again. Next post will be another chart same trade different time frame

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Internet Explorer, billy? Now, not even the newbies are going to take you seriously.

2nd chart E/U 22nd Jan 15 min chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) using 15 min chart we managed to trade it earlier, we got in at 11-30 uk time for 30 pips it dropped approx. 20 before moving up. The reason I put this random trade to you is,,,the first trade method A gained 14 pips before spread etc, it could of easily been less than 10 pips. But the second example gives you time to make a few more pips and get out if needed or scalp ALSO, I have noticed look at the BB ma when it crosses the 20 ema (blue line ) on 15 min chart, this looks good. This is new to me but the actual Charts A and B I did trade very similar only exception being I was more selective on entry

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Attached Image A few years ago we had a Russian defector who flew in a mig jet,, At first this jet was ridiculed due to the way it was built. it used old valves not state of the art like the western world used. Everybody thought gosh USSR really are poor and no money for state of the art fighting machines. Then they realised sh*t these jets can fly through nuked areas massive bombed places, they just keep flying, They are good. how about rifles ak47 for instance very simple. Standard self defence tool is a pen (writing) you cannot be arrested for carrying a pen but they can be used like a stabbing knife, Do you get my drift. Simple is sometimes easier and simple tools in the right hands are awesome. A master is a master is a master

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Alls I was saying is that your idea of using the BB Moving average, commonly known as a Simple moving average and an Exponential moving average to trigger trades on any time frame, doesn't even qualify for the rookie level. Of course, when you mention the Simple Moving Average as the BB moving average, really, what is somebody to expect by the rest of the post? That it will make more sense? That it will actually contain anything reasonable or relevant? Code up your EA Billy. Let's see how she flys next week!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Sorry. In the final analysis, there is really nothing that any trader can suggest about what you are doing, that will change the final outcome. Have fun with it, and hope you learn a thing or two.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
are you a trader.PNG Proxy, Responding to a few people who have pinged me. Nearly every EA ever made will fail, If they didn't fail an EA would of been made years ago and everyone will be using it and be RICH. A good trader doesn't need an EA. Robot systems can work in the right conditions but they cannot reason or think so these too will fail. Gambling method, pick your trigger which can be anything associated with a level such as high/low, breakout, retrace , cross over and stick to the method. Hope I am helping

--- 帖子 #267 ---
That's true at our level but bear in mind that the big boys use highly sophisticated software/algorithms.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Is that why two noble prize winning economists had to go bankrupt. The human brain can still outdo the best supercomputer in recognizing stuff: like good trade setups. Having said that, the algorithms help immensely, but they cannot keep you from lapses in judgement. We keep hearing in the news of "rogue traders" at the big houses, who go belly up, get sued or arrested for fraud... And they had the best equipment helping them that money can buy. So don't get intimidated by those teams of professionals, sitting around their massed screens eyeing every transaction that takes place anywhere in the world. They can be wrong ---can be wrong---can be wrong. (Of course, so can I)

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi, I am sure that the highly sophisticated software of the big boys would of filtered down to everyday traders but obviously it hasn't so I would say they do not exist. I am sure they are more than able to just plod along as long as nothing major happens and not lets forget the EA industry is worth millions of £££- $$$ Robots are wonderful they can build cars even park them unaided, fly planes, play chess it is the thinking part they cannot do. Anyway bud good question and one can easily google EAs and check it out, and do not forget a lot of scammers are out there trying to trade their losing ideas

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Don't be ignorant. You don't know does not mean that good EA doesn't exist like if you don't believe God doesn't mean He does't exist.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Now I get it... You post the Pinnochio pic autograph when you contradict one of your previous posts. Kind of a way of letting the rest of us know, what you don't know. The whole Hunt for Red October, ping thing, still eludes me...but I will go all Forest Gump in my assumption on that one... "Stupid is, as Stupid does". So, does this mean we won't get to see your EA in action next week?

--- 帖子 #272 ---

This is my last post of this thread, since there is nothing to learn here, nor no one to teach. Billyt, please resist taking the bait. There has already been too much fighting on this, and the previous, thread. Magix, you are a no nothing trouble maker, and if Proximus were smart, he'd put you on the ignore list, too. Take care guys, and have a good weekend. Edit: Sorry about the "smart" comment. Instead, maybe, "Proximus, please consider putting Magix on ignore."

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I think billy is someone who was trading at the right moment, got lucky, and got out. I don't think there is any skill other than posting hindsight analysis. The hard right edge eludes him.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Disagree. Every time a post is made, the thread winds up on the hot list, and people browsing read the post. Keep posting GEfx, you have posting well. Proximus, will come back and look as he evolves.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
That's good. Be one less poster we have to try and look past in developing. Really, all you seemingly are is a naysayer with nothing to actually add. Can't help wondering if you have read the thread title... Statistical Gambling. Now this statement is just flat out, untrue. I am a lot more than just a trouble maker. Sure I stir the pot every once in a while, but this in itself helps to allow new ideas to bubble to the surface...I for one have taken a step outside of my own comfy little world to join in on the fun...while you continue to piss and moan. But I do like how you DARE Prox to put me on the iggy list. Implying that he is stupid if he doesn't see things your way...Yeah buddy, this is productive. But, now that we are done having to read through your thoughts, the rest of us can just go CRAZY! I can feel it, it's about to get all stupid up inside of this Bitch!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
My Actual thoughts on the Statistical side of Statistical Gambling...and much the reason for the logic I have implemented. If you flip a coin and consistently guess that it will land head side up each and every time, the odds of you being correct are 50/50. If you change your guess per flip, these odds drop. Sure you might get lucky and beat the 50/50 odds, but for how long? I have said before but will repeat for the idea of the thread, that if you consistently take a long trade, even in a short market, eventually, you are going to be correct as even a broken clock can be right at least 2x per day. So... If you are taking a single trip signal that will hold until prosperous, and close down at any set level by way of taking a loss, how far ahead of the market are you actually "GUESSING", that it won't take the exact same trigger right after you have closed in loss? If you are taking a single trip signal, how can you have any idea how far the market will actually carry that trade? Again, another blind guess. Under the assumption that the broken clock will be correct 2x per day, I have a fairly high hit rate on a single set of market specific criteria that I am using for a trigger. On the worst days, I am still going to assume that it will be correct at least 2x in any single direction. Because it is trading both sides of the market, that actually gives it a better chance to come up being correct possibly 4x per day. Each and every market day is different as is the range of each market relevant session. London, TK, NY all trade inside of the same Market Daily Candle, but quite often will stay inside of the range created by the London Session. Any break outs above or below are an "almost", guaranteed retrace. So...If I can stay and add longs until I am correct, knowing that another long signal might be just down the way, why wouldn't I take it under basic market retrace assumption? If I know that it the market will vary in ranges, per day and per sessional movement, why wouldn't I allow market to Dynamically set the range? Even at a negative net close for cost averaged trades, the range should be great enough to limit the size of loss, by allowing a high probability trigger to find these pivotal points. So... Long until Short. Short until Long. Cost average along the way. and Let the market decide how much profit will be allotted per directional trade... Make sense?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Especially :" Each and every market day is different as is the range of each market relevant session. London, TK, NY all trade inside of the same Market Daily Candle, but quite often will stay inside of the range created by the London Session. Any break outs above or below are an "almost", guaranteed retrace". My instincts tell me this is quite correct: that the GBP has influence far beyond the size of their economy is pretty well accepted... Intend to keep an eye out for such Breakouts catch their statistics in attempt to better understand why, and what reasons may cause this tendency to fail. Good eye. Thank you , Magix

OK, let me change my comment about participating to only participating when the discussion is trading. I'm a trader, not a gambler. I'll admit to not knowing everything about trading, and knowing nothing about gambling. I do have a trading journal, but there is nothing about gambling there -- lol.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I think we are all gambling to a certain degree simply because we are not 100% certain that a trade will work. I think the key to trading is learning how to gamble intelligently, and as Rap said, even firms like LTCM and Lehman do not get this right all of the time. Trading is like baseball, if you can get it right just 40% of the time you are going to be a hall of famer.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The real Meat of the Matter is that all sessions will play the same money, just not necessarily on the same day. I used to track n trade thse, looking for the hidden areas where support and resistance are actually based on the daily roll of independent sessions. Track down the isession indicator. Add it to your current template and make a couple of relevant session charts. You'd actually be amazed at how these play out. It takes a little time to get it set proper, as you will have to adjust the timezones to your current broker, but is well worth the time. My typical observations were for TK, London and NY and always based on the EURUSD cross. I have a few charts in my history that give an idea of how I used to watch n play these. Set the targets by the lines and wait for direction from there on out. Example HERE . Edit... A couple more HERE . And HERE . And HERE .

http://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/correlation : You can get lost in the correlations on this page... Actually I was stumbling around on this page when I came upon the idea of Parent -Child on which I am now fixated. I have been considering the use of this method on different chart time frames and this is what I came up with (could be right -- or not!) The daily chart is too slow. Parents will change their minds all but a few times at this time range. Operations on Bar[0] is just like going to a faster time frame. There seems to be a Goldilocks parallel In that the other end of the scale seems too fast. There is a given amount of sashay to a signal so that by chance, rather than a true trend, The parents can issue false starts and vetoes, followed by never minds as soon as you enter. You need(except in unusual circumstances) much more than one or two bars to reach a decent tp. I prefer to reach that tp in as few bars as possible., and at least some time for the parents to "Make up their minds". Of course, when in profit, my greedy heart is biased toward taking the money and running. You can always re-enter upon a push from a parent, or news. When in loss, though, what is the point of correlated hedges unless you can give a trade some time to make good? That is where I am in debate as to what the best course is. On all time frames the parents seem to influence the child. I have never seen a child "disobey " its parents. Perhaps on a surprise news event this can happen -- but how often won't the parents quickly line up with the news as well? good luck with your trades

Hi, sorry to offend.surf the web and you will see thousands and thousands of sites selling EAs. I wonder why. I believe a person can programme an EA which he can use to help himself as a tool. As for selling it I shall not answer. May I ask. Do you trade using real money. I do not need to know your answer. As for god loll. Drop me a line in 6 months when you've made it. Be good trade well. As for god lol

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Higher odds? Cripes no! By logic alone, after my EA takes it's first trigger, it will spend 100% of market time in a trade. And, if there is a big enough gap, mine will start off almost immediately... By cost averaging and market exposure alone, I am standing against the odds of actually surviving the week with a hundred bucks.

--- 帖子 #288 ---

How about this billy, instead of asking others how they do it, why not man up and show others how YOU do it. It's easy, just say you are going to be long or short at x price before the price actually gets there. There is your predetermined entry. An even better way is to get an account and link your TE to it, and collect data. I hear that keeping a trading journal is essential if you are going to be taken seriously.

The point I was trying to make billy is that you have come off as an authority on all things trading. I do not choose to dispute that. What I do ask is if you are really trying to be a help, then you have to draw a road map of some sort, in the form of a system, a TE, an EA, something that can be followed and if need be, improved upon. I do not think that is an unreasonable request. It is not about proving anything, it is about helping to write a good and practical textbook. Proximus is not the only one out there with questions like his. What is so hard about that?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Let's have respect yall. Billy do your thing. Don't take anything in here too seriously. Even the abusive posts. At the end of the day you are on a boat enjoying your life. Turveyd made a mistake by letting his anger get best of him. Magix, looking forward to your EA! Nice to see you in here JMN. I want to share a few things in here just need time to write it all out in a coherent post.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I may have over filtered the gambler...bitch still hasn't traded... However, an unfiltered version that I am running isn't doing terrible and I can at least verify the trading...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Fantastic FFury! Can wait to read your thoughts

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Ok i`m back, i was on holiday in the weekend Now its time to get back to business.I've read most of the comments and some were informative, but most of them didnt contributed much to the subject.Meanwhile i thought that incorporating the market cycle effect, can significantly increase our chances of win. I`ve read Magix's grid system, it is a good idea i think.By using pivot point it could help us, but i think the market cycle effect is the winner here. By studying daily market cycles i`ve found out that the EUR/USD will range more between 17:30-&gt; 5:00 GMT+0 (UTC) It is fascinating, because this will increase our overall chances of succes by atleast 50%, if we only trade the EUR/USD. Now lets sum up our doctrines once again: -Ranging system, no SL ,no manual close of a trade (let it roll until margin call) -Grid trading, but no hedging for now, entries probably based on MA's and Pivot points now as Magix suggested -Only trading between 17:30-&gt; 5:00 GMT+0 -Not trading near monthly low or high -Not looking at fundamentals, yet, but probably incorporating that soon -TP small to increase our chance of succes, but bigger than average spread -Smallest spread possible needed, so we will stay at EUR/USD, furthermore the E/U is great since it ranges more than any other market.

WB Prox. Not much to report on my Gambler yet. It has only taken 1 trade, hasn't cost averaged in, and is sitting with about +35... Such a Tight trigger, I hope it actually finds a nice exit as well....

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Finally we are talking about how to trade, no fighting any more. Kudo to all who has good spirits.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Kind of a sad day for the gambler... Not enough of a push to have actually closed it's single trade and open counterwise yet... Same for a nedged version I have running for multiple pairs on a separate account... Too tight for exits, costing the EA ranges. I am actually okay with it sniffing out grand positions, but if it never exits, not much point. Soooooooooooooooooooooooo.... I have loosened the trigger to hopefully at least see a closed trade. This being said, it will only exit on a loose trigger, not enter. Still going to look for greatly overbought and oversold areas for entries and a little less criteria involved in taking profit. For one thing, it will not, or should not be in market 100% of the time now as the exits for each direction is not the same as the entries. Might make a difference...might not. At least it hasn't flushed a hun yet!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks for the heads up: will be plotting the British range on relevant charts . Have a minimuum of 200 p a day from here on in

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Partially due to the shitty little range that EURUSD has been playing this week...my $100 hasn't actually grown that much... Applied trigger to allow longs and shorts playing on multiple USD crosses, has actually been able to find a little more.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Nice magix, which one of your EA is this so i can link it in to this thread ?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
The TE labelled $100 Dynamic was the one I created as my gambler. That should be the one linked to thread as that was the specific design and intent. To run a single trade pair with $100 account start and not only live but prosper for the week.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Done, lets see now how well it will go.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Definitely could use some tweaking... Thinking of even loosening up the Trigger on Entry just to see if I can hit the missed ranges. Given FOMC today will be the true test. Personally, I'm sitting it out on a manual level and having a tight entry for EA might prove to be a little wiser, can easily adjust for next week... Meh...nothing huge so far, but no big DD either.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Houston... We have a problem! The EA has seemingly taken 2 identical positions, same lot size and same price. Though it is a good position, this will skew the overall results. Weird, I have checked through everything and cannot understand why this additional position was entered.... DAMMIT!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Use a time filter, to not enter twice in a position at the same bar.It is very annoying and its 2x risk, of course the reward is also twice, but its better to diversify than just risk 2x more on the same trade, its not rational.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Problem is... The order was sent 2x and processed 2x. The grid was not respected, there is no reason for me to believe that a time filter would have been either. This is the same basic core code I have been working with for over a year now and have actually never seen this happen. This would lead me to believe that it is a broker issue, more than issue with code or trigger. If order was originally rejected and resent then accepted both times, filling at the exact same time and rate is a possibility... Really the only thing I could think of that makes sense. Additionally, I am not typically interested in time as I am in the orders to fill at specific trigger and with the Trigger on Gridded step. But thanks for the idea on time filter.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Oh, then its a different issue.I thought it was a common error that newbie EA programmers do, which is that they dont put a filter to not place 2 identical orders at the same bar/time. If it was a broker issue, you should contact your broker and ask them what happened.Maybe it was a server/lagg issue that caused it to trigger it twice.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
If it were real money...I'd actually be on the horn with tech support hitting them with my best WTF?!?!? But, as this is a Demo account, hard to say where the server is, what lag or latency issue might have been present and I wouldn't expect that I would ever really get this solved by some geek sitting in a chair, making minimum wage to be help desk. I think that there are still modifications I should be making to this, especially on the profit side. I don't like it holding onto profit for too long as this can easily turn to loss, so I think I have some work to do on the exits. I am still infinitely happier with the Dynamic Range, given the weak ass market week, there has still been enough range to churn 300 pips on EURUSD, and this with it still missing trades. Just a trial run. At least I know there's a little hope for this one.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
And yet... It is hard not to be satisfied with an EA that even in a flat market can detect Overbought and take exit... The whipsaw earlier, the EA didn't see this as being the top, and held out for more. When more wasn't on the table and the throttled back trigger was in effect...SHAZAM! Took the money and ran! Pretty fucking kewl, actually... Sure, might be patting myself on the back...but seriously...very nice. This is an M5 chart, just to give enough room to show trades on the week. The actual trader works off of the M1.

Looking real good, Magix. You could be on to something, here. Rob

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I think we both have a good idea how this is going to turn out... But all the same, it is fun to watch. Nice to see ya in print again, Rob. It's been a while.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Demo accounts usually dont lagg much, its the big lagg on real accounts and the requotes that could mess up the strategy.It could be a more serious issue maybe with your code.Even if you use the code for years, that doesnt mean there was not a hidden bug inside it.You might wanna fix that before going live with it. EDIT: Looks like my losing position is going to turn around, after 2 weeks ,well anyway lesson learned, never going to buy or sell again near monthly or weekly low or high.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
New version of the system, i improved it in the last 2 weeks using your ideas and suggestions guys, now its way better and we wont make the same mistakes twice UPDATE: VERSION 1.5 (NEVER MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES TWICE) We will use now my custom daily pivot point indicator called APROXIMATOR 1.0 , which is specially modified for this purpose, this way we wont trade at daily-weekly lows or highs, we will always stay in the middle I will try this new version of the system as soon as my losing position gets closed Stay away from news or high volatility situations as usual I replaced the Moving Average with the DAILY_MID pivot point, because the daily mid pivot even though its not dynamic , it shows better and more accurately the center-mid price where the daily price movement tends to fluctuate towards.The DAILY_MID pivot point is a much more realistic daily mid price than a daily moving average for example. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pair: EUR/USD Timeframe: M1 (1 Minute chart) Indicators used: APROXIMATOR 1.0 (Custom daily pivot point indicator made by me) BUY ENTRY : The price must be between DAILY_MEDIUM_HIGH and DAILY_MEDIUM_LOW, we enter BUY if the price 1 candle ago was below or equal the DAILY_MID, but now ,at the current candle,its above it SELL ENTRY : The price must be between DAILY_MEDIUM_HIGH and DAILY_MEDIUM_LOW, we enter SELL if the price 1 candle ago was above or equal the DAILY_MID, but now ,at the current candle,its below it TAKEPROFIT: 35-40 pipettes on 5 digit broker or 3-4 pips on 4 digit broker STOPLOSS : None, yet (still experimenting with this new system) LOT SIZE : we will use now 1% of the account balance LEVERAGE: 1:1 is the best, the more the leverage the higher chance of the margin call. LOT SIZE (in MT4) = ACCOUNTBALANCEINCASH * RISKPERCENT/10000 Only 1 order open at a time, dont move TP, and dont close orders manually, wait for rebounce to your TP.Also dont forget to withdraw the profits frequently in case the margin call will wipe out the account. Here is the new template &amp; indicator: Attached File(s) APROXIMATOR V1.0.mq4 5 KB | 3,312 downloads Attached File(s) gambling system 1.5.tpl 2 KB | 626 downloads

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Here is a little more explanation for those who are a little bit confused. Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can clearly see that today the EUR/USD on was only tradeable between 0:00 gmt+0 and 7:00 gmt+0, because only then the price was between the DAILY_MEDIUM_HIGH and DAILY_MEDIUM_LOW, right after 7:00 when the London session opened, the price got down below the DAILY_MEDIUM_LOW and its still lower than that, so its not tradeable at the moment.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
So for example,according to V1.5 rules, today our last trade should have been at 7:07 GMT+0, because the price was above the DAILY_MID before that, but it just pierced trough and went down at 7:07 so according to the 1.5 rules, we should have entered our last SELL trade at 7:07, and we have won that. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course, before that 0:00 and 7:07 we would have had 7 hours to trade the sh*t out of the market, and all of our trades for today would have been a winner. I`m very excited to present this new system, unless there is an unexpected major news with high volatility or something like that, its probably a 99.9999% winrate system

--- 帖子 #333 ---
now this looks a lot better,lines in the sand are clear and defined,like it .good luck

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Proxy, hope your good. Keep the trade life alive. I only pop in now and again. I am half busy developing trading strategies (or one) I was busted earlier yet again but realised it was my fault as I set up the scanner on pc wrong, Be good

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Thanks, its not the best yet, but its still considerably better than the previous versions where we didnt take into consideration the daily low-highs. I`m still tweaking the system, and at the moment i`m backtesting it.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Wow Magix WTF is this? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looks like your EA is not doing well, i have to remove it from this thread since its ruining my system's reputation. Besides my new 1.5 system will probably be better than the current forward test , that i`m doing. Why are you suspended again Magix ?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hi Proxy, good to see your newer method is holding up. Regarding the suspension of Pinocchio, the guy isn't here to defend himself so I would advise you in a friendly fatherly way to man up and don't mock him. Be good bro

--- 帖子 #338 ---
M, thanks for the mail. Hope things plan out for you, Funny thing is I am now getting interested in the gambling side of forex .I'll probably end up on the streets , started there end there be good n take care

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Glad to see some science on this forum, just got my master degree @economics. @Proximus: Have u consider using a diffrent approach for the distribution, like multiple density. Dig around for markov switching, it's been proven to be better than ma. I still have to submit revision for my thesis, and required to write a journal for publication so I still won't touch fx for a while. MSM mainly used in central banks, but I think it is viable to use in fx. There was already a works in fx, and it was quite good. I have the journal on my pc -I'll share it later. MSM use internal dummy to separate regime(i.e bullish and bearish) and have different parameter for each regime. The dummy formed by a markov process depends on previous period state, switching from a regime to another by calculating of transition probabilities. In my works it was consistent that switching happened after there was unusually high volatility observed. Growth/bull period is when there is low variance/volatility, contraction/bear happened with high variance/volatility. Hope this would be useful for u :-) .

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks for the idea, i`ve never heard of that method, but i`ll look into it.At the moment i`m trying to analyze the cycles of the market, even though we try to build a mathematical model of the market, we still cant ignore the human aspect of it. It is a known fact that when new market sessions open, more volatility can be expected, and in this system we try to avoid that.So far i`ve found out the the best time to trade is between17:30 -&gt; 5:00 GMT+0, because in this time range the volatility is the lowest.But still researching. ________ But until i research, i would be happy if anyone else would try my system on a demo account, and make a TE so i can link that into this thread.It would be a great comparison chance on different brokers. So if anyone wants to try my 1.5 version of the system on a DEMO forward test, post your TE here, and i will link it to the thread

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Proxy, surely you want the volatility its a gift for grid systems, up down every thing gets triggered

--- 帖子 #342 ---
This system avoids volatility events, because we only scalp the small deviations from the daily MID price.Sure a breakout from the mid price can be helpful, but look the other way if it goes against us, usually the price tends to jump to that new level, and then it will stay there for a while. For our NO-SL system, that can be very harmful

--- 帖子 #343 ---
hello Proximus, how do you calculate your mid high and low levels please ?

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Its easy, you can get that from the indicator, but for simplicity here is the formula: HIGH = previous day's high LOW = previous day's low CLOSE =previous day's close pivot = (HIGH + LOW + CLOSE) / 3; DAILYMAXHIGH= (2 * pivot) - LOW; DAILYMAXLOW = (2 * pivot) - HIGH; MID = ((4 * pivot) - LOW - HIGH)/2 ; DAILY_MEDIUM_HIGH= (MID + (2 * pivot) - LOW) / 2; DAILY_MEDIUM_LOW = (MID + (2 * pivot) - HIGH) / 2;

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi proxy. Your daily pivots. Take it one step further calculate the pivot from example the uk session or/and us session and play them against each other. My girl used to calculate them for me

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Prox... My system was designed to take a loss as needed. Looking at it...I'm still ahead in profit. Best not put it back up, it will only embarrass you further. BTW...this new EA of yours, is it designed to beat the Market "Statistically", by never trading?? Statistically, that is the only edge.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Welcome back Magix Nope i consciously didnt traded for a week, i`m too busy now with another project, that is why i asked that anyone else can test it for me, the EA no matter what will have atleast 4-5 trades/day if its ran 24/7 , i will put the EA here and perhaps if someone is interested can do the forward test for me on a demo account.Because i dont really have time now

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Prox, I fail to see how setting an EA on an account consumes any time...given the basic logic, I don't even think your EA would consume much by way of resources. There is an infinite number of free accounts you can open, and even for my personal PC, albeit a little dated, can and does run 7 platforms at the same time without hiccups.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Its not about time, demo accounts or anything, i have 3 PC's and i run them all, and need all of their computational power to backtest my theories.I dont have an extra VPS to run an EA 24/7. Its very time and resource consuming to run my backtests, with my high quality data that i have it usually takes 2-3 hours /test just to backtest only 1 configuration on my entire database.And thats on an I7 processor... So all my computational power is required elsewhere at the moment, but when my research is done then i will continue my forward test.You must understand that So in the meantime if anyone is interested to run my EA on a demo account , feel free to do so, but if you do, please create a TE and post the name of it here so i can attach it to this thread and see how well it goes I`ll upload the EA in a few minutes , just making the last checks on it.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I know you will refuse again to listen to actual fact on this, in me stating that your time is completely and 100% wasted on back test results no matter what quality you get...so ask yourself the simple question: If backtests worked, why aren't there more successful EAs available? Forward tests are the ONLY way to gain any sort of market semblance and understanding of true performance.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
You have a point there, but i`m not backtesting in the conventional way, i`m more like data mining, finding when the market is good for a trading purpose, relative to a time period.So i`ll have a better understanding about the flow of price and when or at which time the traders are more biased than other. Get ready for my EA PS: I also edited the indicator, and now we will take into consideration the monthly highs and lows also, as promised, sorry for the delayed update

STATISTICAL GAMBLING EA V1.5 (Based mostly on the V1.5 of the system, but modified a little bit) Features: Configurable TP (35 pipette default as the system rules of v1.5 ) Configurable maximum slippage &amp; spread (20 pipette spread &amp; 10 pipette slippage as default) Configurable risk (set to 1, and its recommended to not change it) Graphical Interface (to show additional information on the chart) Updated APROXIMATOR indicator , we will take into consideration the monthly high &amp; lows aswell, and also changed the formula of the pivot, we will now focus on the median price, instead of the typical price. -Use it on a DEMO account for the purpose to forward test the new strategy and the new indicator, if you decide to use it on a REAL account, then i`m not responsible for the losses it could make. Here is a quick backtest for year 2013 (until september for the price to have time to reverse): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) backtest v1.5.rar 15 KB | 463 downloads Instalation: move the APROXIMATOR V1.1 in the indicator folder, and the STATISTICAL GAMBLING EA V1.5 EA in the experts folder. If you forward test my system on demo acc, please make a TE and post the name/link of it here, so that i can attach it to this thread and so that we can follow the progress of my EA.Thanks!

If we assume that you have optimized it to 3.5 pips... According to your tests, this has taken 141 trades, all of which were profitable, with exception of the last. In an average year, there are 5 trading days per week, 4.2 weeks per month and of course, 12 months per year. From there, we are going to subtract the 2 biggie holidays that nobody trades, being Christmas and New Years and assume that this will work the rest of the time. 141 trades/250 days = .564 = 1 trade every 2 or so days...provided that it doesn't go into a week long DD like we have already seen. To generate $36 worth of profit. Now given that somebody that wanted to attempt this, should in fact allow for long draw down periods, and statistically, it is possible to catch upto 16 weeks of Draw Down, and knowing that Back tests do not actually calculate in swap fees, it would seem that the cost of running a statistical gambler would be done at the cost of power and resource consumption... Meaning, if you had to pay for your power watched left $100 bucks in play for a year and dwindled away this account on broker fees, there is an incredible likelihood that you would actually come up at a loss. I could be wrong...but I'm not. It would seem that selling your hair or collecting pop cans would actually be more prosperous than this venture...as far as entertainment value, it'd come up as a zero. Hello forest, I'm sorry we missed you by looking at all of these trees... But good luck in testing it!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Wait... Hold the presses... Something I may have forgot to mention. The above might seem a little negative, but that is actually, statistically, the Best Case Scenario. There is the actual possibility of holding on forever below your break even because of continued loss on swaps during long periods of DD.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Uh...yeah...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
The last one is unprofitable because it hasnt got time to reverse, so i didnt included that one in the backtest, but definitely it didnt got a margin call, so it was proof of 1 year without a margin call. Yes the swaps could f*ck us up, i havent calculated this, but i have no way of predicting what could happen ahead, so that is why a demo forward test is good. Maybe if you want you can do the forward test , you already have 4-5 demo accounts on forward test so why not add 1 more there __ Anyway, new version of MT4, time to check it out.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Bud your a star. Try listening to someone. Magix is doing his best to help and your just wasting part of your life. Be good and I hope you prove us all wrong

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Proximus, Aproximator v1.1 sets the Monthly Max Low for EURUSD to 1.3553 (CET based broker) but the Day Mid is at 1.3515 so there's no possible trades for at least another day using your EA. Day Mid being below the Monthly 'Low' line is true for GBPUSD, EURJPY and USDJPY as well. EURGBP has the chance for a trade today but only if it goes up another 15 pips but given the small range I don't like it's chances with this system even if it does trigger a trade.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
In the grandest scheme of likelihoods, this suggestion doesn't even show up in the shadows. Having an idea of market movement and a base understanding of what you have devised as a system makes no relevant sense. Again, because your ideas of trading are green, to say the least, and because you stats are based on BACKTEST reports, I don't need to undertake this, for the sake of proving myself correct. Again, even at optimized settings, with my fingers crossed and having four leaf clovers surrounding my pc, even if this was the inevitable outcome, I still don't like the results. Last week, my Gambler made 30% and wiped back to 11% for week close and is again back up 30%. This is my idea of a gamble. Consistent profits, with a relatively low DD and if strategically tested Monday - Wednesday only, if future results are the same, could possibly show 120% gain in a month. But, I will leave it run, see how it continues to drive and see if effectively trace the market dynamically.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I thought thats obvious, but i guess its not.Its not wise to trade when the daily stuff is above or below the monthly high/low. So we only trade when the daily mid is between MONTHLY &amp; DAILY HIGH/LOW, and of course the price just crossed the DAILY MID from a direction. This way we will be close to the monthly median price and have a very high chance of reversal at any moment.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi Proximus, What timeframe does the EA should be best to forward test? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Short answer: Doesn't matter. Long answer: Other than the extreme corner cases (price gaps over the Daily_Mid line between candles) it won't matter what timeframe you run it on as the indicator is hard coded to the Daily and Monthly to set those lines and the EA is just checking each tick to see if the price has crossed the Daily_Mid line (and the other lines are lined up appropriately).

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Buying and selling dynamically... There is always risk in market, but my little gambler seems to be handling the load rather well. From a highside 30% last week, just closed 80% gains this week...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Insane Magix. Well done.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I am currently taking the triggering 1 step further on a cross market correlation trade. Method 1: Using OBOS zones for EURGBP to trigger trades on EURUSD, EURJPY, GBPUSD, GBPJPY. and Method 2: Using AUDUSD + EURUSD to trigger trades on EURAUD. I just wrote the code for EURAUD trades last night, so far it has only taken a single trade. Kinda kewl shit!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Yes, technically it doesnt matter because the indicator is already viewing predefined timeframes, but just for better visualization i think M1,M5 or M15 are the best. I`m open for suggestions, it seems that i underestimated your EA, but lets wait a little bit more, it think its too early to celebrate just yet.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Here is one of my EAs being tested by another member. This one is completely without indicators, it follows price. EA name, FTL -&gt;follow the leader. The logic is available. Something to look at and learn from if you are interested in momentum or price triggering. As per our previous discussions on triggering, this one works with the Bid and Ask in relation to the previous candle for triggering. In its original version, it was dynamic, the re-released version is static, user defined. Something to watch and learn from. From here, implement your own strategies. I know how I would modify it to restrict trading...but will leave you to study, in case you want to play around.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Good job, i will follow this thread , but at the moment i`m very busy, keep posting good stuff. I will check my new system soon, and find out where to go next.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Only 48 pips closed into the Weekend, holding an 8 pip loss. I figured it would do alright, given that these last 2 weeks are statistically the best 2 weeks to work with a Grid Bot, but am pleasantly surprised at the overall performance. For a gamble to turn 84% net in 2 weeks...a worth while gamble, I would say. But as you have mentioned, it is still early. It will be the true test moving into the next 2. $100 Dynamic...DYNAMIC!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yeah i made many EA's which stood up for the test for short period then failed.Once i had an EA which made 18%/day for 1 week straight then second week it made -40% /day for the next week So we need more test, however i`m confident in your EA ,and open minded about anything you would like to discuss.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
does the EA works on backtest? been getting error code 4054. which version MT4 it should be used? thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
It was built on the older version of MT4 so it might not work now.But i dont use this system anymore, sorry

--- 帖子 #247 ---
My backtest is doesn't work.
