I said in my previous thread," Simple and profitable Trading Style" that I will separate stochastic trade setups from the thread. I will be here as much as in the other thread sharing stochastic related setups.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
There have been misconceptions on method of using stochastic oscillator. Don't get me wrong. If you're profitable with it good luck friends.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Stochastic oscillator is powerful indicator to follow trending market. It's also a great indicator to get into new position when we're not already in- continuation trade setup. We cannot use stochastic to fight trending market.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
How do we use it profitably? When price is moving between 20 and 80 we just have to stay away. This is because no one can determine the direction of the movement. For bullish trade, when price gets to overbought region, above 80, if a visible resistance is broken while stochastic is still on overbought then we have a great bullish trade. Then for bearish trade when stochastic gets to oversold region and any visible support is broken while stochastic is still on oversold region, then we have a great bearish trade setup. I have already shared some stochastic-based setups on my previous thread.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
It doesn't need too much explanation. I will be sharing all here

--- 帖子 #6 ---
The misconceptions were that we should take position when the main and the signal converge/diverge, above 80 or below 20. If you have been focusing on this practice you would observe that stochastic sucks accounts

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Those who are following my previous thread, EURNZD long was the last I shared. I missed the first entry point with the strategy i share on that thread. I got in with stochastic

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I wish to bring them here again some of the pairs worth waiting for with stochastic: AUDCAD, weekly; USDCAD, daily; GBPUSD, daily; NZDUSD, daily; NZDCHF, daily, EURCAD, daily. I have posted some on the previous thread

--- 帖子 #9 ---
EURCAD long breakout is slow and deceptive for me. No clear breakout

--- 帖子 #10 ---
No matter how watchful we are some trade setups would slowly escape us by not forming strong signal

--- 帖子 #11 ---
It doesn't need much for sure but we will require the settings that you use mainly, I expect Default of MT4 or did I see 8,3,3, in the other thread? Also, a few charts to keep interest going, but I have to ask, are you color blind? Just curious why those horrible green background charts, very unusual to see, especially for sharing and demonstrating. Trade Responsibly

--- 帖子 #12 ---
It's MT4 default, it's 8,3,3. I never changed anything on bollinger bands. Am not colour blind . I was just testing the colours that could fit Fibonacci. Fibonacci is too dull on white background.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
On what time frame do you use stochastics?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
It can be used on all time frames. But I trade the daily, weekly and the monthly timeframes

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I think everyone following the thread will turn color blind by the end of it

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I have changed it to default mt4. About four FF friends have been so curious about the colour. Take the new chart on my EURUSD long position

--- 帖子 #17 ---
The colour also good for Fibonacci and stochastic. Enjoy following me

--- 帖子 #18 ---
sub

--- 帖子 #19 ---
EURCAD I have been waiting for is cunningly taking shape; It seems prepared to ambush me

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Just curious why all the daily trades always respond to weekly psychological support/resistance and make U-turn. I wish to always get out with weekly support/resistance. Am still checking

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I wish to say here what I have said in the other thread that I could be both bullish and bearish in one currency. For example AUDNZD long; AUDUSD short. Am using eleven platforms for my backtesting. I don't want to skip some that meet my entry point

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Also am avoiding taking correlated pairs. This is because a strong retracement on the correlated pairs could easily wipe account even when our positions and analyses are correct. For example am already bullish in the following GBP pairs: EURGBP, using lower band rejection strategy, EURNZD, EURUSD and today I have entered EURCAD long. They are all in different platforms.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hello 9jatrader, if I understand well, this strategy is to wait until we have the stocastic above 80 and to wait until a resistance is broken, then we enter long, or to wait until we have the stocastico below 20 and to wait until a support is broken, then we enter short, right? I see you use also BB, what is the purpose of them? Which TF do you use? Do you use SL, TP? What is usually your target in term of RR? Can you please post some charts with clear entry, sl, exit? Thanks, subscribed! Okrim

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hello 9jatrader, Thanks for the input. Could you kindly elaborate on the reasoning for your statement if possible with an example. I want to understand why it is so...: "Also am avoiding taking correlated pairs. This is because a strong retracement on the correlated pairs could easily wipe account even when our positions and analyses are correct." Thanks

--- 帖子 #25 ---
would your suggestion be to enter long at 30 or short at 70 then?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Please I will answer yours questions here soon I have shared so many charts in one of my threads, even stochastic-based setup in "Simple and Profitable Trading Style". I have the current EURNZD long position

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Okrim, You got it right when to enter. I use SL, my TP is the last weekly high ( resistance ) for long position; the last weekly low price ( support ) for short position. rYour stop loss should be below the broken resistance- for long position; and above the broken support- for short position. I hope am able to answer all your questions. If there are still other questions send them and let us all learn from your questions.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
We don't have to be too picky with SL. Having too tight SL is like having no SL. The SL could be triggered easily even when your analyses are right. Some try to have fixed amount of pips for SL. It's wrong.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
No. I was not taught that way. My using since I was taught proved that we cannot use enter at long 30 and short at 70

--- 帖子 #30 ---
You could see now that it's time for EURO. It's dominating for now. If you take all in one platform as they form, by the time they start retracement or even reversal, account may not be able to stand it. All your profits would disappear. And secondly you may be emotionally ready to leave all your positions open even when your analyses tell you that it's just a retracement/adjustment

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Here is the GBPUSD I said am waiting for. Stochastic is resting and sleeping on oversold area, and there is nearby support.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
If GBPUSD shows up with bullish body, we might have bullish trade. We're approaching a very strong support- daily, weekly and monthly. I will jump in when it has gradually left oversold

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Setting previous high for TP would be over 500 pips. I hope I don't miss the bullish move

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Here is another chart on NZDUSD, daily. I believe we know what I mean now.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
One of the interesting things about using stochastic on overbought and oversold region is that which ever the direction we follow. That means if it breaks the support while stochastic is oversold we go short. Then failure to break it we have long trade. We should never ignore SL, in case middle band pose as a resistance and send it back to the support area

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I would say that one is like a sniper when stochastic gets overbought/oversold and there is a resistance/support,respectively, to be broken

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks 9jatrader for the explanation...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thank you too for joining us here.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Am just wondering once again why some NZD pairs small movement amount to great pips on the platform. If You would measure GBPNZD, NZDJPY, EURNZD you would see what I mean. See small movement on my EURNZD is over 200 pips

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Maybe senior guys can provide us with some answers. Am just curious.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I must say here that in using stochastic oscillator patience is need just like any other strategy/indicator. We cannot get in just because stochastic is on oversold/overbought region and there is a support/resistance respectively. Be patient enough and allow it to be broken. "Don't drive your car even in an expressway with your eyes close" . We trade what we see and not what we hope

--- 帖子 #42 ---
As you continue to take more stochastic-based trade setups, you would know more. Happy weekend

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Okrim I thought I have answered all your questions. I just saw that some of the questions have not been answered. About time frames I trade- I trade the daily, weekly and month time frames. You also asked about the use of bollinger bands. Bollinger bands is a powerful indicator. It helps to know the liquidity in each pair. We use upper band to follow trending bullish market, while we use the lower band to follow down trend.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Bollinger Bands also helps to know when trending pair is loosing strength- exhaustion. When market trends strongly it hardly cross middle band.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I hope the little explanation helps

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Good night everyone here

--- 帖子 #47 ---
MT4 default, it's 5 ,3,3

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Mr. Brown, Maybe we learn from each other here. I have broker-connected MT4 Bollinger Bands. It's 8,3,3. I don't know why yours is 5,3,3. Perhaps you trade direct from MT4 platforms and not broker-connected MT4.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I agree with Mr Brown, if you press the Reset button in the Parameters tab, the default is 5,3,3 Personally, I use 8,3,5 - it's 3 Fibonacci numbers and looks smoother Anyone ready for Gold selling this coming week? Cheers, John Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Although I don't trade Gold am already bearish on AUDUSD. Also Gold bearish move is around support. Good luck if it's broken

--- 帖子 #51 ---
If correlation is anything to go by, EURUSD already bullish and may affect Gold bears. I hope to get out of EURUSD spike,because it's not trending now. trending pair is easy to trade

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Could be good luck or good analysis, call in the professionals https://goldstocksforex.com/2017/03/...-at-rate-hike/ Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi, yes, you answered my question, thanks! So, here you say that the failure to break the support gives us the chance to go long. If the price bounce to support, when you open a long trade? Once the stocastic is above 20? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
The stochastic main and the signal must have crossed each other and move little above 20

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Okrim, We must know that no matter how strong and good strategy we have no system/indicator is fool-proof. Always remember your SL. The strategy failed me when I used it- the failure to break below to go bullish ones in USDCAD. It was returned by middle band and later went bullish still from the support. I decided not to get in again.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I will be joining EURJPY bulls tonight

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Yes sure, SL always!

--- 帖子 #58 ---
EURJPY seems nice! Both 4hr TF and daily TF shows stocastic in overbought area. So, if the price breaks above the trendline it would be a LONG signal, right? Do you wait for the candle to close before to decide to enter the trade? Will you enter based on 4hr or daily TF? And if the price fails to break and turns down, once the stocastic is below 80 we can enter short, right? Again, will you enter short based on 4hr or daily tf? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i will not go short, on the longer tf bulls consolidated

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i shared the chart in my other thread,"Simple and profitable trading style"

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Sorry, i don't understand well what you mean with "on the longer tf bulls consolidated". If the price breaks the trendline, you are going to go long, on which TF? 4hr or daily? At the close of the candle? I go to check the other thread, thanks

--- 帖子 #62 ---
bollinger upper and lower bands are separated on 4hr; it may move sideways or retrace before bullish again

--- 帖子 #63 ---
At the beginning of this thread I said stochastic is used to follow trend. We cannot use any system to fight trend. I cannot use it to fight EURJPY either. It has been trending so strongly. Those who have been following the other thread have the setup on this pair.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Daily; am not focusing on the trend line

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Ok. Look at this chart, i am focusing only on Stocastic for this example. If the actual candle closes like this, we have the stocastic showing to be in overbought condition, but until the last candle it was below 80. My question is: if the actual candle closed like this, with che stocastic above 80 is a good setup to go long? Or maybe is not good because until the last candle it was below 80? THANKS

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I think we should always indicate the time frames we refer to each time we post our chart. From your chart I will say that the stochastic is not clearly on overbought region. The support/resistance should be visible enough.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
TF is 4hr, is written on the chart. So now the candle closed with socastic above 80. Is this a setup for long trade? THANKS!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Okrim, We have to avoid getting into position after a very long movement. Over 500 pips on 4hr. It has moved for too long. Retracement may trigger SL before going bullish again. Then you may not have the courage to get in again. If I were the one I can't join now. I might be wrong, market is always right

--- 帖子 #69 ---
GBPUSD may gradually escape. But stochastic has left oversold region and failed to break the support I pointed out ealier

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Those who have been following know what I mean now

--- 帖子 #71 ---
The trade setup finally showed up - failure to break support while stochastic was on oversold region.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I decided to avoid this pair and focus on NZDUSD long. They formed the same setup- failure to break support while stochastic was on oversold region. Funny enough the GBPUSD long I skipped is moving ahead of NZDUSD long

--- 帖子 #73 ---
AUDCAD weekly is another pair worth waiting for. It's currently retesting 1.031 resistance while stochastic is around overbought region. No one knows the direction yet. The resistance had been holding since April 2014. Do we expect another short trade here?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
It's interesting to do most of the analyses with combination of the weekly chart

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It's helps to exit well and helps to maximize profit. The funny thing about it is that it needs a lot of patience to allow TP to trigger.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Why do you use for this chart 5,3,3 and for the other charts of this same page 8,3,3 I am lost! PLEASE, tell us the parameters that you use and your key time frame. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Maybe it's the brokers who do some changes, I don't know. All I do is that install the indicator and nothing more. I do not alter anything and they all work accordingly. I believe we don.t need to bother much about the settings. I don't even try to see the settings when I install. I only check when other traders draw my attention to the settings. I feel that no matter the settings they work same way Jim, I trade the longer TF, daily,weekly and monthly. I take positions on the daily, while monitoring with the other TFs

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Jim, if you follow me from the other thread "Simple and Profitable Trading Style", you would have known that I take positions on the daily.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Please try and go through the other thread I just mentioned. There are some information I have shared that may be absent on this thread. In many occasions I repeat some information I have shared on the other thread. I call the two threads " Twin Thread ". This is because they are all about setups, but base on different strategy. Happy weekend to you all

--- 帖子 #80 ---
If I have not mentioned it here, though I take positions on the daily, I set my TP on the last or visible support/resistance on the weekly. That's if am long on the daily, my target would be last/recent and visible weekly resistance. Opposite is the case when am short

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Please if you have been following from the other thread, don't be bored when I repeat some of the things I have said there. The reason I now use the weekly as my target was the big lesson I learned from my last NZDJPY long ( The charts are in the other thread ). I said I ignored the strong weekly resistance and it cost me- giving back some of the profits I earned in the position. It was a great move. Funny enough I added new positions near the strong weekly resistance during bollinger band squeeze breakout, only to be trapped around the zone. Another mistake was that as at the time of adding it has made great movement- over 900 pips, enjoying swap also

--- 帖子 #82 ---
How do you find the exact S/R? Those arrows are also supports that are broken if im not mistaken.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
To find exact S/R you zoom out your chart. They would be visible. The ones you pointed are minor support. Whether minor or major S/R when they are broken, there is tendency for retesting. One of the arrows - you would see that during retesting it broke above the broken support ( then resistance ) and become bullish

--- 帖子 #84 ---
We have to accept the fact that S/R are not concrete walls

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I decided to check my chart to find more information from the arrow you pointed. You would see from my chart that when the support was broken the stochastic was not even on the oversold region. This is where market ambushes our position. At the beginning of the thread I said that stochastic helps to filter fake breakout/fakeout.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The stochastic-supported breakout are more reliable.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
AUDCAD is the pair I will be monitoring next week

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The daily candle has closed and so near the weekly strong resistance. Since this line was broken in 5th May, 2013, no candle has been able to break the resistance, then acting as support before it was broken

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Waiting for the weekly candle to close before the bears take position on the daily might be late. And so any strong bearish candle right below the weekly resistance will be monitored with stochastic

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Two conditions I would use to track early entry. When the daily shows up with bearish candle,the weekly stochastic should be leaving/left the overbought region for bearish trade. Stochastic is still right on the overbought region on the weekly

--- 帖子 #91 ---
If traders who love trading breakout can really incorporate stochastic into their trading, I believe that market ambush would be limited. I shared one chart yesterday on GBPUSD support breakout. In using the stochastic, you would know that the breakout is really a fake breakout, because stochastic has not even entered the oversold region. Stochastic, like the other indicators needs "Patience".

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Happy weekend.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
GREAT thread.... thanks bro... subscribe

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Useful Information 9jatrader. Great Going...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hye John, i love your indicator. would you mind share with me and rest of us, your support resistance indicator? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thanks for joining us.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Those who are worried about the settings should backtest the different settings and you would know that they're probably the same

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Those who are worried about the time frames that it can be used should also backtest it also. I believe it works on lower TFs

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Here is the weekly chart and stochastic is already on overbought region

--- 帖子 #100 ---
One of the great interesting things about the stochastic on oversold/overbought region when there is strong support/resistance is that in whatever the direction of the stochastic it makes setup

--- 帖子 #101 ---
If the weekly fails to break it and is leaving overbought, it makes short trade. If it breaks the strong resistance, then long trade- continuation trade setup

--- 帖子 #102 ---
As I have said about two days ago, I wish to repeat. Waiting for the weekly to close might be late and difficult for me to find good entry point on the daily. How do I intend to trade it? I have said it before. If while the daily shows up with bearish candle that's strong and the weekly stochastic is leaving overbought, I will jump in

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Don't mind me if find that am both bullish and bearish in a particular currency, especially if you're new to the thread. They are not on the same platform. I have been in long trade in AUDNZD. I might have AUDCAD short. Having both on the same platform is a counterproductive trading. Happy Sunday.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
It might be about 600 pips down.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Still waiting for AUDCAD. It's right around strong resistance. Who knows what maybe happen this week. Maybe bearish engulfing around the zone

--- 帖子 #106 ---
inspiration by this thread.....

--- 帖子 #107 ---
i try first, but still to control this final day chart looking good for divergent stocastik, so maybe best entry

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Great job. Am already bearish.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Bearish engulfing did finally show up yesterday. It's all about setup and not profit/loss

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So funny now- am in positions where am paying swap in most positions

--- 帖子 #111 ---
What entry- bearish or bullish

--- 帖子 #112 ---
i think today still bearish, next week we see agaian, reatest again and come to reversal bearish maybe... stocastick looking bearish divergent

--- 帖子 #113 ---
The GBPUSD I skipped is moving faster than the NZDUSD I took. They were based on the same setup and on the same day- that's refusal to break below support while stochastic was on oversold region

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Not too bad. I still have it in my trade journal as if I took the trade.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Use atr to filter volatility, trade with most volatile market if you use oscillator. Just my teo cent. cheers, D

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Please if you can give us more lesson on ATR, it would be appreciated. No strategy is bad. Great thanks

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I did it. I am very good; Almost a true master of my stochastics.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
check at london and NY market today...

--- 帖子 #119 ---
. Trade safe and good luck.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Try and have many platforms for the back test. Don't trade correlation. This is because when one fails the others fail also. It might be a retracement. Then you would not be able to conclude the percentage success rate. If GBPUSD fails to break the resistance and stochastic gradually left overbought, then we have bearish trade, about 400 pips before the support

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Upper band rejection will add more confidence in getting into bearish trade.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Trade safe and do not ignore SL. Having the opportunity to trade another day is a priority.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
AUDNZD so scary now on the weekly- strong Dark Cloud Cover. I will be closing first thing when market opens tomorrow Sunday

--- 帖子 #124 ---
It's was formed around resistance. Leaving with little above 200 pips, loosing little over 100 pips

--- 帖子 #125 ---
weekly resistance failed to be broken while stochastic is still on overbought region. Quick take profit of over 200 pips using the support would recover some pips I lost

--- 帖子 #126 ---
My bias next week- Red mark to Red mark and then run. From the chart the previous resistance took it down to that level

--- 帖子 #127 ---
nice one bro....

--- 帖子 #128 ---
this is so good to use. initially i used with good setting of this stocastic but i forgotten

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Ok, thanks

--- 帖子 #130 ---
You need to remember again. It's a powerful tool

--- 帖子 #131 ---
For those who trade GBPUSD, wait for trade setup. I have posted the chart. Stochastic is already on overbought- I said it before. If the stochastic can move from overbought below, then we might have bearish trade. Check the chart I sent before.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
As I said before, GBPUSD and NZDUSD had the same bullish trade setup based on stochastic. But GBPUSD moved faster before it got to a resistance, while NZDUSD is trapped around middle band

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Middle band is a potential support/resistance as I have always stressed. No problem with NZDUSD bullish bias.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Happy Sunday and trade safe. Always remember your stop loss

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I closed my AUDNZD long. Am already short

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Do you consider the economic related news when taking positions?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
No. I don't trade news, though I check news to know what was responsible for strong movement- bearish/bullish

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Market now opens at 4.00pm EST

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Bad day for Euro. No changes in trading bias in all the pairs I have shared. Still holding to my positions.

yes i must recollect that .... when i seen your this thread i am much impressed

Ok, thanks

Am bearish AUD pairs and bullish in Euro pairs. I have shared many of the charts here including in the twin thread-" Simple and Profitable Trading Style"

Second bad week for me

--- 帖子 #160 ---
AUDCAD short, NZDUSD long AUDNZD short already showing some positive signs.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I hope to come with the charts which keep my confidence to still hold on to the positions

Am in a position where hedging helps to quickly recover

--- 帖子 #164 ---
The method is simple

--- 帖子 #165 ---
yes day light saving from march 13th onwards to nov 7th

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Now you got what I mean. I like this period; I can sleep early

--- 帖子 #167 ---
The position is trapped around the daily middle band. It's because of the weekly middle band. The weekly middle band is acting as a strong resistance. I have said it over and over that middle band acts as a potential s/r

--- 帖子 #168 ---
even i like too this early sleep..

--- 帖子 #169 ---
AUDCAD and AUDUSD have finally closed below bollinger lower band on the daily. Only time will tell how the bulls will have counter-attack. So far so good.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I made the mistake of bringing AUDUSD on the other thread. It was not based on that strategy, but on weekly stochastic- that's failure to break the weekly resistance while stochastic was on overbought region

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Though AUDNZD was not based on stochastic, the movement fairly good. But rejecting lower band. The setup was was based on strong Dark Cloud Cover below resistance. I shared when it was formed

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The chart

--- 帖子 #173 ---
The interesting thing is that strategy on the other thread is formed- using the weekly middle band and the daily lower/upper band. The weekly candle on AUDUSD closed below the middle band while the daily closed below lower band. Am not adding more position

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Good night

--- 帖子 #175 ---
EURUSD and USDCHF failed to break visible support and resistance respectively. How will next counter-attack be

--- 帖子 #176 ---
AUDCAD short trade setup was not based on either of the strategies on my two threads. It was based on strong Dark Cloud Cover below resistance. They say professional traders trade with more than one strategy

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I will be bringing each as they move

--- 帖子 #178 ---
AUDUSD short was based on the strategy here, stochastic trading. The weekly failed to break resistance while stochastic was on overbought region. As I always say when it gets to oversold/overbought region, whichever direction we follow. When I got in middle band caused a very strong retracement.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I mean the weekly middle band. Weekly has successfully closed below middle band, though weakly/not too strong.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Good night everyone. I got the time at this hour and so I decided to share on the thread, which is like a trade journal for me.

AUDCAD still performing accordingly. Over 200 pips, still left with over 300 pips down the road.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
AUDNZD short so slow to perform

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I continue to learned how market reacts to psychological support/resistance. My AUDCAD short will be closed on the recent weekly support. NZDJPY long taught me lesson. I ignored the weekly strong resistance, forming double tops and Dark Cloud Cover.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Almost half-way to TP. I will adjust when there is great setup around support.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Just as I said earlier I will be bringing all the charts I have shared/entered as they move

--- 帖子 #186 ---
The setup was not based on stochastic, but strong Dark Cloud Cover right below resistance on the weekly chart. This resistance earlier formed Tweezer Tops which took it down to over 200 pips.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Strong bullish retracement again on AUDNZD. So scary again

--- 帖子 #188 ---
It would be good for few pips scalping

--- 帖子 #189 ---
The daily bullish move is caused by the weekly middle band. Middle band acts as a potential s/r

--- 帖子 #190 ---
In this case it's acting as a support. The weekly not too bad. Just the daily is scary.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
GBPCAD gradually going toward stochastic-based trade setup.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
If the resistance, 1.75 can be broken while stochastic is already on overbought region, we may have bullish continuation

--- 帖子 #193 ---
All the stochastic-based trade setups I have shared will be coming your way- NZDUSD, long; AUDUSD, short. The week was good for NZDUSD. Am enjoying the swap , same with EURGBP short, though based on another strategy. It's all about strategy

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Stochastic Oscillator /USDCAD traders. Stochastic already on overbought region, just waiting for breakout

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Any breakout would be a continuation trade setup for those who missed the 13th April setup, strong Piercing Line supported by lower band breakout.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I skipped the 13th April because of the EURUSD long I was in. I have closed the EURUSD long when French election result rain in enough pips with gap. Am our EURUSD long trade.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Good night, am not taking any position tonight.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Scalping little above 200 pips moving so far. Am both long and short in this pair in different platforms- all about setup and not profit/loss. My long position was based on strong bearish/Dark cloud Cover right below resistance, supported by upper ban breakout. Then few weeks latter a counter trade setup was formed on the daily- Strong Hammer with bullish body-for long trade setup. the bullish movement so far

--- 帖子 #199 ---
This pair has so much to teach. It's going up to test the resistance around which tweezer tops were formed on 28th and 29th January, 2016. Am using the resistance to get out the bullish trade, while the bearish still be open. Wants to learn tweezer tops and tweezer bottoms and what they can do check babypips

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I will also monitor the upper band rejection, even before TP is triggered. Failure to pierce the upper band, I will be out before TP is triggered

--- 帖子 #201 ---
USDCAD continues retesting the said resistance. Breakout would be an explosive trade. Hope it finally breaks out

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Stochastic still lying around the overbought region

--- 帖子 #203 ---
There is already a breakout at this session. Hope at the end of the day candle closes still above the resistance. Stochastic still on overbought

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Resistance breakout, after gap. Can this be trusted? I will be bullish. I ran away when I was highly favoured by gap up on this pair

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Please for the purpose of those just reading the thread for the first time I can be bullish on EURUSD and be bullish on USDCAD. It may mean a counterproductive trade since am both buying and at the same time selling USD. I do not place the two like this in one platform. Just searching for strategy- profitable one

--- 帖子 #206 ---
USDCAD really scary now that market has closed. This is because of the long upper shadow. Am out, taking EURUSD again

--- 帖子 #207 ---
We still have about 400 pips on EURUSD

--- 帖子 #208 ---
If strong bearish candle shows up tomorrow on USDCAD I will go short, especially when stochastic gradually left overbought region

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Good night

--- 帖子 #210 ---
USDCAD may gradually escape me. Still breaking the resistance while stochastic is still on overbought. GBPCAD also forming same trade setup It's currently retesting resistance while stochastic remains on overbought.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Still tracking USDCAD, gradually forming a strong bearish movement on the daily, around the resistance in focus

--- 帖子 #212 ---
USDCAD and GBPCAD have formed stochastic-based trade setup. I have much about USDCAD

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Am holding u long and took long today in gbpcad. Will see

--- 帖子 #214 ---
*Holding long in EU

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I wish you good luck. Another pair still forming stochastic-based trade setup- EURCAD. This would be the second stochastic trade setup on EURCAD. I have shared the previous one. Very important resistance

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Am still holding mine position after running away when I was highly favoured by gap up. I later joined on resistance breakout. I think I have also shared it. Good luck friend

--- 帖子 #217 ---
When setup are formed on correlated pairs take only one

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I made not so funny mistake- entry GBPAUD instead of GBPCAD. Checking the charts again to find the mistake and that GBPAUD already in profit. I decided to still enter GBPCAD. Now having one position in each pair. This could be compared to "Fat Finger" entry- adding "0" to your entry.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
EURCAD is also making a strong move base on stochastic. Hope the breakout would be nice and tantalizing

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Charts would henceforth be shared when setup finally formed. Watch out for EURCAD. But the watch list would posted here before it finally formed. I wish you happy trading

--- 帖子 #221 ---
EURCAD not so strong for except it closes better than the current movement

--- 帖子 #222 ---
AUDNZD is of great interest to me. Am both bullish and bearish in different platforms

--- 帖子 #223 ---
There was bearish engulfing on the weekly and I closed my long position. Few days a strong hammer with bullish body formed on the daily and have to go and see what would happen. It's performing so well

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I hope to use a buy stop order on the short SL to recover

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I hope to use a buy stop order on the short SL price to recover

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I hope to share how to average up. I believe you have heard

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Maybe tomorrow. Good night

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hi 9jatrader. #Post1 "I said in my previous thread," Simple and profitable Trading Style" that I will separate stochastic trade setups from the thread. I will be here as much as in the other thread sharing stochastic related setups." I have to agree that it's simple as you say. But now being profitable no longer seems to me, according to your various trade explorers. But good luck.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Do you need any reply from me? Indicate and let me reply your silly comment. Have you been following from that thread and read the mistake I posted in NZDJPY? When traders loose they enter FF thread to share their anger. They justify using live account to learn what is Forex. I never though I would have such "MUMU" like you here. Do you know my initial account? All my account are micro

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I wish to point out here that all my account are $200 and $500, for the purpose of those keeping track of explorer instead of the movement of price after my analyses.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Am not angree . Learn from mistakes. Anyway wait for EURCAD setup based on stochastic

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Have you heard that average up is a wrong trading method? That's when your TP is about to be triggered and you move it for more profit

--- 帖子 #233 ---
When you have more than one strategy. If the first entry was based on one strategy and then a continuation trade forms with another strategy, should you run with your profits, instead of taking the continuation trade setup

--- 帖子 #234 ---
AUDNZD long was based on strong hammer with bullish body. I was set to get out using the resistance. Now another may formed around the resistance, based on stochastic. My intention is to average up and take another position

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Stochastic already on overbought region. I will loose in my bearish on the, use buy stop to recover

--- 帖子 #236 ---
You must be making some confusion. I´m not following you or your thread. I´m not asking you to show a real account. I´m saying that according to your TE .... I dont see nothing " profitable ". My comment is just a comment and its not silly ... now insisting that´s profitable and its not, for me that´s " silly ". Do not fool yourself ... and the others around. Keep going.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I do not need you to follow me. If you have the brain to understand me, let me paraphrase here, after loosing traders get into FF thread to post nonsense. They can't contribute positively and let others share from them. When traders have lost their hard earned money, using live account to learn what is Forex and later found a thread, saying "I made pips and all that with the positions they entered how do you expect them to believe?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
If only you can be bold to share your trade explore also. While setting invisible on your profile. It really shows how troublesome you're. You can't distract me. The two thread are "My Trade Journal". When I was being mentored, while some of us were really appreciating this man and his team, There were also like you on the website.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I would repeat "wait for EURCAD" continuation/reversal trade setup

--- 帖子 #240 ---
AUDNZD is also part of my focus- putting distractions behind me

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Whatever you can share with your fellow traders, please do. Not criticism.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Regular divergence on H4 and D1 and 2 pinbars on H4 portruding BB squeeze, so the tendency is for the price action to go down this week.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi Fxenthusiast, You're very correct, possibly for continues retesting on the daily. The month closing strongly above the middle band, while the weekly closed above the upper band after a long time.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
But on the daily, no signal

--- 帖子 #245 ---
em with us, really appreciate your time and effort, grate job please continue with mentoring us, one question , Do you draw your support &amp; Resistance line in daily? Weekly ? Or Montly chart ? I understood that you mostly operate in daily chart but its very imporant to know in wich time frame you draw your S/R lines. Thanks in advance, greeting from Europe/ The Netherland. ps- i also repleyd on your previeus thread, still waiting your answere. Thanks

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi 9jatrader are there any trade setups today

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Thanks for your appreciation. Glad to have great people like you here. We would continue to share and learn from each other. When mistakes are made we can also learn from them and be sympathetic to one another instead of bully each other here. I draw my support/resistance line on both daily and the weekly most of the time. I wait for price reaction and setup around the zone. On the monthly when price has reached the lowest/highest ever on the monthly I monitor the movement and look for a possible entry point on the daily. Greetings from Africa/Nigeria

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Market has not closed on the daily. I only take position on the daily

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Doji candalestick was formed on the resistance on the awaited EURCAD

--- 帖子 #250 ---
it's interesting that stochastic is still on overbought region, refusing to leave

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I decided to join the bulls on EURCAD. GBPCAD and USDCAD already working- all based on stochastic

--- 帖子 #252 ---
can someone tell me the bb settings plz

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Period: 20; Deviations: 2 Leave it the way you met it in MT4. The MT4 already has it's own settings

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Not based on stochastic, but forming strong bearish engulfing again

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Please am sincerely sorry. It's AUDCAD short.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
To make it up, am sending the chart I got in in the first setup, 21st, March

--- 帖子 #257 ---
It retraced strongly not near my TP, after about 300 pips down. Some traders are used to moving their SL to BE as soon as possible. I don't do it. Because I was taught not to. I would have been out by now at BE

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Trust your system when price retraces. My TP is still down the road, about 600 pips

--- 帖子 #259 ---
If market closes so well like the current movement, today's setup would even be stronger than the previous setup

--- 帖子 #260 ---
The previous daily movement was obstructed by the middle band and formed strong hammer, having bullish body on the middle band

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I will be monitoring the middle band again on the weekly and see how price reacts. Hope it crashes below the middle band

--- 帖子 #262 ---
It's all about trade setup and not profit/loss

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Wish you happy trading

--- 帖子 #264 ---
ok thanks

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi 9jatrader Price rejection at overbought, and resistance level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
This one broke resistance and looks to be a continuation trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ezzy

--- 帖子 #267 ---
And last one, another continuation trade. Lets see how all three progress. Any constructive feedback is always appreciated. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ezzy

--- 帖子 #268 ---
You got the strategy right

--- 帖子 #269 ---
How and why I did not share AUDCHF is so unclear to me. But I have it in my journal- really crashing down now. All about strategy and not profit/loss

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Am out of all JPY pairs for now. USDJPY has so many small resistance. This is termed "Choppy"

--- 帖子 #271 ---
This one is really better than USDJPY. Monitor 148.163 resistance. The interesting is that stochastic remains on overbought. Nice to have you

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi Ezzi, Is like you're using the 148.163 resistance as your take profit

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi 9jatrader Yes, using next significant resistance for TP, using 1:1 RR at this stage, but may close it before end of week, dont like to hold trades during weekends. What would your suggestions for TP and SL be. Thanks Ezzy

--- 帖子 #274 ---
You may stick to the plan. Sometime another trade setup is made around that TP, when stochastic is still on overbought

--- 帖子 #275 ---
EURJPY traders wait for trade- who would be in charge, bears or bulls. But stochastic is on overbought

--- 帖子 #276 ---
USDJPY is cared of weekly middle band

--- 帖子 #277 ---
If price continues like this in EURJPY I hope to be bullish before market close. Last weekly candle was even strong, strong hammer with bullish body above the middle band

--- 帖子 #278 ---
The daily closing, having long lower shadow. But how the market will finally close, time will tell

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Stochs still remain on the overbought region, inviting every bull

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hehehehe....

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I hope to share the method of maximizing you target even if you have already set your target, using the twin strategy and other strategy, possibly with charts. Am using it in my EURUSD long

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Interesting now that stochastic produces more trades than the other strategy, possibly because of breakout every now and then

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Yes, agree. More breakout than we expected

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Any breakout not supported by stochastic could be fakeout

--- 帖子 #285 ---
A point of note here. I could be bullish and bearish in one currency. Example am bullish in EURUSD, bearish EURGBP, bearish in USDCAD, bearish AUDUSD. I don't buy and sell one currency in one platform. I have more than twelve platforms for my backtest. And so, am not bullish in EURUSD and EURGBP in one platform.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
For those who already known how to follow/join trending or price movement with stochastic. Assuming you have been in a long position and set your target around/on resistance. Would you still leave the target when stochastic is already on/around that resistance? You can monitor the breakout with stochastic and move you TP further. It's all about maximizing profits

--- 帖子 #287 ---
When trading any breakout don't be too picky with SL. Some traders have a set of pips they have as SL. That's is not proper. For example don't set your SL right on the resistance when you trade resistance breakout. It should be below the broken resistance. This because sometime retesting the broken resistance can be very strong and made you feel it's not going to work. If you're too picky and have too tight SL, it could be triggered and then go to your again. You can see it in NZDUSD long I shared before now. Later I will bring the chart. Every position offers platform for learning.

Update on the GBPJPY trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Ezzi, You're really doing great. I joined the bulls on EURJPY before market closed yesterday. The setup still strong- having long lower shadow with bullish body. Already in profit

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I mean long lower shadow. I already edited it

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks 9jatrader That one looks like a good trade, it also looks like it has reached a level of resistance, it may slow that pair down or turn back. Hopefully it will pus through that level whilst still overbought. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #294 ---
It has broken a five-month high, around the zone where bollinger bands squeeze was formed

--- 帖子 #295 ---
There is possibility of a strong retesting of the broken resistance, now a support. That's the reason we need not set SL on broken resistance/support. But the bulls are too strong

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Special note: EURUSD has been rejecting upper band since 20th October, 2013 until the last weekly candle. EU Bulls, celebrate We might see 1.14 breakout, who knows

--- 帖子 #297 ---
What I now work on is how to widen target, using stochastic.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
AUDCHF strong hammer and forming good confirmation

--- 帖子 #299 ---
It's sometime surprising to see how market reacts and formed strong setup on/around weekly S/R

--- 帖子 #300 ---
This may be a great threat to EURAUD long trade holders, being that they're strongly correlated with AUDCHF

--- 帖子 #306 ---
You're doing great. Am about 250 pips in this pair. Target still far- the previous recent weekly support. Keep it up. As time goes on Ezzy you would maximize your profit.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I was able to catch this also. When strong hammer with lower band breakout is formed, it moves accordingly, especially around support

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Similarly, when strong shooting star is formed below/around strong resistance, we don't need too much analyses before getting in

--- 帖子 #309 ---
About 170 pips before target on AUDUSD. My AUDNZD short still going deep

--- 帖子 #310 ---
It's all about setup and strategy- not profit/loss

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Your right! Couldn't finde your settings on the Bollinger Band and exact settings on stoch. Can you upload a picture? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
You don't need to change any settings. Just leave them the way you met, except you wish to change colour. Just my tip. I have one chart here. I wanted to reserve the chart until there is another trade setup. Stochastic is already going overbought and there is a nearby support to be broken. When broken I will not take more position, but gives my the gut to hold on to the position

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hope price breaks that support zone, it may also be a supply zone. It it doesn't, we may get a reversal trading opportunity. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Not the same timezone = not the same chart = unable to setup the right indicator parameters. :-(

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Time zone has nothing to do with MT4. Is Switzerland not using the same time with UK? if it does Nigeria and your tie zone are the same because Nigeria and UK have the same time zone

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi kofix Perhaps I may be able to help you. Setting up this chart is one of the easiest you will ever do. So, add the bollinger bands to the chart. The settings should be (period 20, shift 0, deviation 2). In most cases this is a standard setting. Do the same for the stochasc indicator. The settings should be (k 5, slow 3, D 3) My settings are slightly different, but I think you should start with the settings suggested by 9jatrader. And thats it! For the purposes of the strategy presented in this thread, this is all you need, nothing else. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I have K 5, slowing 3. period 3 on Stochastic. Bollinger bands- period 20, shift 0 and deviations 2. Do we really neead to know all these. I never bothered knowing all these until I was asked about my settings. I just install indicators and start using them, except I need to change the colour

--- 帖子 #318 ---
9jatrader I just wanted to say that I am really enjoying this style of trading, very simple, accessible via mobile phone, and longer time frames. It suits the way I trade. Thanks for sharing your system. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thanks. We're moving together to success.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
GBPJPY in focus, retesting five months resistance 147.029 while stochastic still remains on overbought region

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Thanks Ezzy and 9jatrader. Nevertheless my chart and indicators looks different. Do you always calculate on "close" or perhaps "weighed close" or something else?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
AUDNZD making another, second trade setup- stochastic on overbought region; also the weekly already closing below the middle band while the daily is closing below the lower band. The weekly middle band and daily upper/lower band strategy is based on the first strategy I have in one of my threads. I bring the strategy here because is in combination of stochastic here

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I was able to catch the movement with better lot size, 0.04 in $500 account. Same with EURGBP short, 0.05 in $500, having two positions in the two pairs

--- 帖子 #324 ---
There is something I have always wanted to share here. If you do not give your position enough breathing space, you may have some problem with this strategy here. The reason is that when there is a breakout there is possibility of a strong retesting of the broken S/R. Therefore during resistance breakout your stop loss should not just be on the broken resistance, now acting as support. It should be below the broken resistance

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Trade update Missed my TP by 10 pips Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Trade update This one came close to my TP.....but I decided to close it 30 pips early Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Am still long

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I mean my position still open on AUDCHF

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Yeah, me too

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Ok. Am monitoring 0.76451, though TP is further than that level

--- 帖子 #331 ---
The 0.76451 is the level the previous support from that hammer took it to

--- 帖子 #332 ---
So many potential set ups!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Yea, stochastic has given me more trade now. The strategy on the other thread still working- EURGBP short.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
GBPJYP is looking promising, I'll post my chart when I get home tonight. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #335 ---
GBPJPY out of my radar. The resistance breakout not impressive and stochs already leaving overbought. If any strong bearish setup comes under the resistance that may be a bearish trade, and not buying JPY because of it's interest rate

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi 9jatrader What's your opinion on USDJPY?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Am already long USDCAD. About USDJPY, while the weekly closing above the middle band the daily has consistently been rejecting upper band- the first strategy I have here

--- 帖子 #338 ---
USDJPY not making any strong setup base on any strategy. It can be choppy. No resistance breakout while stochastic remains on overbought. If it can break the last high 118.119 while stochastic is on overbought it may be great setup

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks. Does it mean you also waiting for a confirmation on the weekly?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Whether setup would work or fail, we should have the reason(s) for entry.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
The weekly showed bullish movement, but the daily refused to close above the upper band. It's not on my focus as far as am concerned

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I see. Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Ok

--- 帖子 #344 ---
EURUSD bulls let's celebrate

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Still confident with EURGBP short

--- 帖子 #346 ---
9jatrader, I'm long on EURGBP as off this morning based on your other method, this pair is meeting that criteria nicely. All the best. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #347 ---

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Trade update TP hit TP may have been too early and this pair may go down a lot further, but I cant complaint with 240 pips Ezzy

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Good luck Ezzy

--- 帖子 #351 ---
AUDCHF long position triggered my SL. Continuation trade setup making it's way. Stochastic going oversold and price is already on a strong support zone. Any one that triggers SL I use it recover.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
With about 90 pips to TP of about 380 pips on EURUSD I hope to move my take profit further- not greed but following weekly stochastic

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I will be keeping my eagle eyes on 1.14472 strong weekly resistance

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Happy Sunday to you all.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Am yet to see the stochastic-based breakout trade that triggered SL. The great problem is that of keeping emotion while retesting strongly the broken S/R. Anyone that triggers I will report it here and share the lesson I have learned so far. Here are some of the positions: EURJPY long; EURCAD long; GBPCAD long; USDCAD long

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Using stochs requires good SL. I have shared how to use the SL. Don't be too tight with SL

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Trade update EURGBP doing well, based on 9jatrader's other strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Good luck Ezzy. I got into bearish position with the strategy also, but the pair refused to trend down- so funny. Though SL not triggered yet because I always use the weekly candle that combined to make the setup. AUDCHF showing some bullish move, maybe signal the bearish move on EG

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thanks 9jatrader A question about your system. Do you have any rules about closing trades in cases where you get an opposite signal for that pair. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Ezzy, you may be a wiser man here with your TP. The strategy made over 200 pips movement before retracement. Am still short in EG

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Yea I monitor or get out with the recent weekly S/R. That's for bullish position I use the most recent weekly resistance either to get out or wait and see how it reacts to it. Opposite is the case with bearish position. I use the recent weekly support to either get out or wait and see

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Problem with Stochs- GBPAUD and GBPCAD coming strongly to retest the broken resistance

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Am out USDCHF short, only 242 pips- at least not loss. i closed because stochastic already leaving overbought and price could not break any support while on daily. Besides it's a great support on weekly

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Closing my EU bulls; hope to return. The last bearish engulfing with upper band breakout is scary for me. Also am scared of 1.12521 resistance, not broken since September 2016. Bye EURUSD for now. Am already bearish. The trade setup was really tantalizing. I can't miss this . I might be wrong, Mother Market is always right

--- 帖子 #365 ---
So many information gave me the gut filling to be bearish on EU. The USDCHF, its correlated pair failed to break support and the main and signal already converged and are leaving the oversold. The level I pointed out earlier on EU even acted as a resistance during the US presidential election. It was also a resistance on the bollinger bands squeeze before the election

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Yesterday's shooting star may possibly help my EG short

--- 帖子 #367 ---
USDCAD triggered my SL during retracement and forming consolidation on Fibonacci 50.0%. Am already in again. Retracement is a problem with any strategy

--- 帖子 #368 ---
The chart

--- 帖子 #369 ---
No TP for now

--- 帖子 #370 ---
CHFJPY is another pair on the radar. It's currently retesting five month resistance while stochs going overbought

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Good night.

Trade update After sustaining a retrace, the pair is now moving higher. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trade is based on 9jatrader's other strategy. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I might close this trade tonight, as I get a bit edgy at times when I leave trades open over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I am short on this pair, currently in the red, but I am optimistic about it Attached Image (click to enlarge) Time will tell. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I wish you good luck. I hope the bulls take control from Fibo 50%

--- 帖子 #376 ---
It's very important we have confidence in whatever system we use

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I ran away with my profits on AUDNZD short. It's currently breaking support while stochs is on oversold region. I was scared yesterday and have to close the positions

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I adjusted my stop loss as we approach the weekend, and got stopped out......shame, as its still on its way to my initial TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ezzy

--- 帖子 #379 ---
AUDNZD continues making a continuation short trade setup. If it closes well it would form short trade setup based on the two strategy I have- stochastic; the weekly closing below the middle band and the daily closing below lower band. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #380 ---
if possible I will be in again before market close. I got out yesterday, though with profit, I never knew it would break the support-though hours before market close

--- 帖子 #381 ---
EU continues to retest the resistance under which the bearish setup was made before crashing down .

--- 帖子 #382 ---
That's great

--- 帖子 #383 ---
AUDNZD short on two strategies.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
NZDUSD picking up now.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
NZDUSD closing above the upper band on daily while the weekly closing above the middle band- first strategy I have. but am not taking more position. It gives the guts to hold on to my long position that was based on stochastic

--- 帖子 #386 ---
EU ready to retest the strong resistance on the daily- hammer with bullish body being formed

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I remain bearish on EU. I do not see game changer for now, until otherwise

--- 帖子 #388 ---
The resistance breakout will not be supported by stochastic on EU. Waiting patiently like patient dog

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I believe that patience will pay dividens with this pair, it hate making predictions, but I am almost expecting a fake out to the top side before plumetting south. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I currently have four trades open, I'll post them when I get home later tonight. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #391 ---
That's what am also expecting- fakeout and will draw traders into bullish before ambush.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I finally decided to press the trade by taking one additional long position. This was because of the additional information on the chart- stochastic was still on the overbought region while price broke the local resistance 0.70509. I had to join with better lot. I might be wrong, but market is always right

--- 帖子 #393 ---
My four trades open at the moment. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Lets see how they perform.....of interest, all four are continuation trades. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hi Ezzy, we're both on the same boat on AUDNDZ and NZDUSD. I remain bullish on USDCAD

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Tweezer Tops are being formed on EURGBP right below 0.87708. I still remain bearish

--- 帖子 #396 ---
AUDNZD stochastic remains on the oversold region. I will be closing with the support and hope to re-enter if the support is broken while stochastic remains on the oversold

--- 帖子 #397 ---
AUDNZD trending strongly, and so I decided to remove my TP from the support. This is because stochastic is right on the oversold region. I want to see how it reacts- breaking it or not

--- 帖子 #398 ---
To double account can really be challenging, I must confess. I hope I do it soon in some of the accounts, though not taking unnecessary risk with my micro accounts- $500, $200 and $100

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I will repeat here again and will that stochastic has been making more setups than the other strategy possibly because there are breakouts here and there. I may not have taken all because of the running positions. Am scared of retracement. And so scared of overtrading

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I have finally closed my AUDNZD short. It was very great movement. It's around seven month support and stochastic is still right on the oversold region. Hope to get in which ever the direction as long as stochs is involved

--- 帖子 #401 ---
please could you show us your bullish bias on USDCAD with chart? Thank you

--- 帖子 #402 ---
My audnzd reached TP Attached Image (click to enlarge) this is the reason why Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Trade updates Dealing with some retracements, but patience will hopefully reward me, or stop me I have a stop loss set for this one......as I am not as confident Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here are the other two Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hope your trading is going well 9jatrader Good luck everyone Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I close for the same reason, though on daily. I will be waiting for setup on the support, either bullish or bearish. Overall movement was impressive.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
About AUDNZD, the daily stochs remained on oversold while the weekly is going to the oversold region. We might be waiting for anther explosive move- up or down

--- 帖子 #406 ---
My trading is doing good, though still continues to learn from the unforgiving market

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Yousername, here is the analyses when and why I entered.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
From the analyses you would see that I said my earlier long position was failure to break support while stochs was on oversold. During retracement, my SL was triggered and formed bullish movement on Fibonacci 50% and I had to join again

--- 帖子 #409 ---
On NZDUSD long I will be closing around the recent resistance

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Thank you. This is interesting. Here's how I see it mate I'd long if the price is able to break above those S/R colored in white. Or alternatively long when the price is able to close above the 4th leg/wave of the 5 waves move down colored in yellow. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #411 ---
That white colour was the support it failed to break when I got in. That resistance is a great focus now, and it's really reacting to it. Am still expecting retracement because of the resistance

--- 帖子 #412 ---
looking forward to next week with the USDCAD pair.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Yes, me too

--- 帖子 #414 ---
CHFJPY still in focus

--- 帖子 #415 ---
The weekly chart will give us a better direction. The weekly and the daily testing the six month resistance, while the weekly stochastic remains on the overbought region.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Another pair in focus is AUDCHF- already made a short trade setup on the weekly chart. After last weekly Doji on ten months support, it broke it while stochs remain on the oversold region and still relaxing

--- 帖子 #417 ---
This ( AUDCHF ) is negatively correlated with EURAUD. When one goes up the other goes down. Hope this helps my EURCAD long also. I will be joining the bears on AUDCHF when market opens

--- 帖子 #418 ---
what about eurusd.?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Just wondering- the weekly stochastic on the daily makes more and reliable movement. Since the 26th February failed to break strong resistance while stochs was on overbought, it has made 485 pips down so far. Am using the same on GBPUSD short

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I remain bearish until my SL is triggered. The bulls are giving the bears a good fight. There is no fresh setup, bullish or bearish now on EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
If the EURUSD SL is triggered, no problem. I will use the weekly stochastic to get in and recover. The weekly stochastic is already on the overbought region right now.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
AUDNZD climbing again above 1.03596 support. This support previously took the movement to over 600 pips

--- 帖子 #423 ---
AUDNZD bulls, you're welcome. I might be wrong sometimes and my SL gets triggered, but market is always right

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Though it's scared of closing above the upper band it's still performing so well.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
It's easier to catch up movement if we followed it down when it was coming down. We remain more focus on it when the setup is made. When I close the NZDUSD long I will be expecting bearish movement on the weekly and the daily strong resistance. Also stochs and the weekly is strongly moving upward. I hope to track it.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Trade updates Fortunately for me, this one is moving in the direction of the daily stochs....took a bit of retracement pain, but hopefully it will continue on its move south. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Next two are going nicely, I have set my take profit already Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any one trading GBP pairs, be aware of the upcoming UK elections. Good luck everyone. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Whoever wins the GBP setup will follow the direction of the trade that had already been formed. US election has taught me that.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
EG making bearish movement from five psychological resistance. No SL triggered yet- I remain bearish

--- 帖子 #429 ---
NZDUSD getting so close to my exit. Am expecting a short trade around 0.73166

--- 帖子 #430 ---
That resistance is one year strong weekly resistance. I will not hesitate to join the bears there.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
While the daily stochastic is already on overbought region the weekly stochs is going overbought. Explosive trade being expected

--- 帖子 #432 ---
EG just triggered my sl

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Any pair that triggers my sl I use it to recover also

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Weekly stochs is already on overbought region and hope to use it to get in

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi 9jatrader Yeah, I saw the move on EG, I wasnt on that trade. But the GBP move helped my GBPYPY hit my TP. Im still dancing with USDCAD, its not too far from my SL. NZDUSD still going well. I'll post some charts on the weekend. Have a good day 9jatrader, happy trading everyone. Ezzy

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Congrats on your GBPJPY. I remain bullish on USDCAD. NZDUSD may move sideways soon. If it does I will close manually and run with my profits

--- 帖子 #437 ---
AUDCHF so funny. Last weekly broke support while stochastic was on oversold, the current weekly is forming a strong counter setup- strong Piercing Line, supported by lower band breakout.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Here is the chart; this could pose a threat on EURAUD bulls. The weekly bearish setup could be on the move

--- 帖子 #439 ---
EURAUD also formed setup around a resistance level 1.51002 - 1.53256. On this level was formed a strong Shooting Star on 7th December, 2014. I hope to join. It's all about strategy and not profit/loss. I might be wrong/right sometimes, but market is always right

--- 帖子 #440 ---
This is where our information and knowledge about correlation can be rewarding. When one forms strong setup the other one also forms

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I do not trade correlated pairs at the same time, except in different platform, for backtesting. This is because when one goes against you the other one would do the same.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Who benefited from GBP pairs following the Parliamentary Election? I lost out in my EURGBP short. But GBPUSD is making it's way following the election. GBPUSD short was based on stochastic- failure to break the weekly resistance while stochs was on overbought region. It' also working so well on my NZDUSD until target is triggered.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I will jump into EURGBP short position again sooner than later. The weekly rejected the upper band and the daily is on strong psychological level.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I will be taking both EURAUD short and AUDCHF long in two different platforms. Happy Sunday to you

--- 帖子 #445 ---
The other thread/strategy is almost abandoned . It produces less trades

--- 帖子 #446 ---
This week could be very bad for EURO bulls

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I lost out of GBPAUD and GBPCAD. no one is safe during elections, referendum and any strong volatility. So bad

--- 帖子 #448 ---
But GBPUSD short is doing well. I have added two sell stop orders to the already running one position

--- 帖子 #449 ---
It's all about strategy and not profit/loss. What works so well today could fail tomorrow. They were based on stochastic. I was ambushed by elections and GBPUSD, short, NZDUSD long are based on stochs

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Trust your system even when they fail during volatility. Great lesson for me

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Trade updates GBPYJP reached TP last week Attached Image (click to enlarge) I closed this one manually as it was stalling before my TP Attached Image (click to enlarge) This next one is looking sexy! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Happy trading everyone. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Good luck Ezzy. It's about 94 pips to TP in my NZDUSD bullish positions. When I see any bear below the resistance I will run with my profit

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I will be waiting for bearish position soon on NZDUSD.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hope it keeps moving up for you

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Finally am out of NZDUSD long. Great movement with better lot size. Am afraid of 0.72273

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Heavy bullet from USDCAD long; so bad

--- 帖子 #457 ---
I decided to join the bears on EG. Hope it works out well

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Trade update I decided to manually close my UCAD shorts, given the current support level.....however I have a sneaky suspicion is going to drop lower, nontheless Im happy with what I have. I will post on update on my journey so far with the strategy that 9jatrader has shown us here. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Ezzy we're waiting. Focusing Mr Stochastic made USDCAD short trade to escape me. It was based on the other strategy. The weekly was closing below the middle band while the daily closed below the lower band two days ago. It's already over 120 pips and too late for me. I will be waiting around the strong support.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
We should not beat ourselves when we miss good trade based on the strategy we use. Another trade we surely come

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Its a great system 9jatrader. I for one, am very grateful that you shared it with us. Attached Image (click to enlarge) cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Time for me to move on. Good luck everyone. Thanks for sharing 9jatrader. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I learned everything about Forex trading free of charge and am glad to share my backtesting with anyone. Ezzy you're really great in your trading. Am glad to have you here. You rain in enough pips with GBPJPY positions.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Thank you too.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
We should be expecting setup soon on NZDUSD. Either a continuation trade setup or a reversal. Why? Stochastic is already on overbought region. Whichever direction we follow. Am already out on my bullish position-fear. It was a great move

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I was lucky to catch the move on NZDUSD with the combination of the two strategies

--- 帖子 #467 ---
AUDCAD is ranging and it's risky having wider target. I have adjusted my TP to the recent support, 293 pips. I hope to get soon.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Strong Pinbar on USDCAD. How far will it go? Additional information on this pair is that it was formed on/around support, 1.32176. Am already in. Market will finally decide if am wrong on right.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I have often asked why the some Pinbar setup failed me in the past. And so have been backchecking some of them. My conclusion is the ones that have high success rate were the ones that were formed on support. Opposite is the shooting star setup- for bearish movement

--- 帖子 #470 ---
The recent date where it was support was 11th and 12 April, 2017. It took it to over 500 pips before the recent bearish movement. I hope to get out with the resistance.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
EURAUD short, AUDCHF long, AUDNZD long just picking up. As I always say, they are not on the same platform. It's all about strategy and setup

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Let me repeat here that I could be short and long in one currency. I have said it in the past and am saying again. For example I have been in a short position in EURUSD; yesterday I enter long on USDCAD. It means that am both bullish and bearish USD. I don't place them on one platform. It's just backtesting

--- 帖子 #473 ---
EURUSD forming bollinger bands squeeze around the resistance it has formed before the US Presidential election. I hope it finally crashes down as it did after the result was released.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Am working on maximizing profit using Pending Orders. That's by taking from the profits in a running position and increase a bit the lot size in a new position.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
It worked so well in my last NZDUSD long before I closed them. Am using it again in the USDCAD long position. I already have additional positions waiting, using Buy Stop Order and increased lot size. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Grave stone Doji candle on AUDUSD. I have been in this pair for such a long time now- since 3rd of March. So bad. We may see NZDUSD crashing soon. They are correlated.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Strong Bearish Engulfing around resistance 1.72268 on NZDUSD. Stochastic has failed to break any resistance while it was on overbought region. The main and the signal had crossed each other and left overbought region.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Not too long ago I said CHFJPY is on my radar. There was a Piercing Line Pathern formed by yesterday and a day before candles.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
But am scared of 114.952 that has been a stiff resistance. Maybe I will trade the breakout

--- 帖子 #480 ---
@ 9jatrader could you please clarify how many currency pairs are you using for these strategy? Some particular or it doesn't matter?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hope to get out of EJ long. Maybe only 153 pips. it's ranging after stochs supported breakout

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Stochastic is used for joining trending market

--- 帖子 #483 ---
The big Boys are out of EURUSD. Strong Bollinger Bands Squeeze is being formed on the daily.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
So funny, of all the platforms I use only Alpari has NZDCAD. NZDCAD has reached the highest price on the weekly chart since 2010. I can't check the price that year. Strong shooting Star was formed on the zone on 6th November, 2016 which brought it down to over 400 pips

--- 帖子 #485 ---
EA for this system

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Good luck. MT4 already has everything for profitable trading

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi what is the advised time frame for EA? Regards Andy

--- 帖子 #488 ---
This pair was patience demanding. It's making a second trade setup based on the other strategy- using the weekly middle band and the daily lower band.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
It's great to be tracking the two pairs. They were formed same day, but GBPUSD went bullish ahead of NZDUSD. GBPUSD crashing ahead of NZDUSD. NZDUSD is currently retesting the weekly strong resistance and it fails to break it. Weekly stochastic already crossing each other and are about to leave the overbought region

--- 帖子 #490 ---
NZDUSD traders wait for short trade setup at the best price on the weekly

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Possibly it's time for AUDUSD crash also.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Am out EURJPY long; it's ranging

--- 帖子 #493 ---
CHFJPY remains in my radar. Stochastic is already on the overbought region

--- 帖子 #494 ---
AUDCAD has made another about 300 pips, retesting strong support. My TP is still far off, half way down. It may return to ranging again. It's still open. The bearish setup remains strong

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Am finally out AUDCAD. The weekly is forming Bollinger Bands Squeeze. Swap was eating deep into the profit, and what would happen when it finally ends into BB Squeeze. I will be waiting to short it on the weekly

--- 帖子 #496 ---
CHFJPY continues retesting; the more frequent support/resistance are retested the stronger they are. I hope it will provide few pips for scalping( short position ) soon.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Just checking what the weekly was doing. Price failed to break resistance 115.491 while stochastic was on overbought region and it has already left the overbought. I hope to scalp 190 pips on the daily.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Though EURUSD is ranging and forming Bollinger Bands Squeeze it has failed to break either 1.13454 or 1.14556 on the weekly chart while stochs is still on the overbought region. The main and the signal had crossed each, though still on the overbought. I still remain bearish.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Just check what the EG weekly is doing. For three consecutive weeks candles retested the strong resistance, 0.88488. The good point now for me is that price failed to break the resistance while stochs still on overbought. the main and the signal had crossed. Will this bring it down. I remain bearish on the daily strong setup below resistance

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Wow, great breakout on CHFJPY daily. So many positive points so lined up if the candle finally closed like this on the daily.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Same with EURJPY, not supported by stochastic. They're both great. This is because of positive correlation of EURO and CHF

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I mean positive correlation of EURO and CHF. I have corrected it

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Avoid recency bias in EURO, except it's a strong etup. Super Mario remains super Mario. Funny ECB man

--- 帖子 #504 ---
In spite of the madness, EU, EG had failed to close above strong resistance. I remain bearish in both, until my SL is triggered

--- 帖子 #505 ---
CHFJPY candle just too big. This makes the market overbought on the shorter TF. And so bearish candles would most probably be formed for two reasons. Because of the overbough and possibly to strongly retest the broken resistance. I skipped, hoping to trade after retracement. The setup still valid for me

--- 帖子 #506 ---
NZDJPY weekly already on overbought region and the daily little bit on the zone. The weekly is better to trap the movement

--- 帖子 #507 ---
GBPJPY stochastic is already on overbought region. We wait and see how market reacts to the resistance. Here is the chart. Am already in, maximizing the profit by removing my initial TP

--- 帖子 #508 ---
As I have said in my earlier post on this thread when it gets to this level, whichever the direction would make setup- bearish or bullish. But I see more bullish bias, since EURJPY broke it's own and CHFJPY also did while stochastic was on overbought region- correlation, correlation.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Good move today

--- 帖子 #510 ---
CADJPY, GBPJPY,CHFJPY are moving almost the same direction on the weekly

--- 帖子 #511 ---
USDCAD traders weekly stochastic is already on the oversold and price on a critical level

--- 帖子 #512 ---
How far with GBPCHF short move go?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
The main and the signal had crossed each other and are leaving he overbought region. The bullish movement was great.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Am already out of bullish positions and have been bearish

--- 帖子 #515 ---
This informed my exit from long position as soon as possible.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
We must admit that every day, every trade- entry and exit market has so much to teach us. What informed my good exit was the fact that while the Bearish Engulfing was formed on the daily, Stochastic main and the signal crossed each other and was leaving the overbought

--- 帖子 #517 ---
The next position am monitoring is EURNZD 4hr. The main and signal had crossed each other. If bear can show up on the daily then I will be in. Last candle was doji, though had bearish body

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I decided to find this post about how stochastic always adds to helping me exit. I have been asked how I exit.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
USDJPY made strong retracement and formed hammer, having bearish body. I have been bullish, SL not triggered below the pinbar and support, 108.338

--- 帖子 #520 ---
My attention now is on the weekly stochastic which is already on overbought. The weekly candle closed with gravestone doji on the support. How will the weekly reacts? Time will tell

--- 帖子 #521 ---
EURNZD is failing right now. The resistance in focus is being broken. I decided to have pending order on the spot of SL, "Buy Stop" so that as soon as the sl is triggered the bullish position takes up from there.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Successful trading cannot avoid adjustment. Staying with our bias when we're wrong can be devastating. I have to adjust my EURNZD expectation

--- 帖子 #523 ---
What keep I monitoring and backtesting is when this is being formed what is the 4hr doing. I just found that 4hr already trading above the upper band. Whichever the direction am ready

--- 帖子 #524 ---
AUDNZD has come to decision moment. Stochastic has found its way to overbought region and there is resistance to either to be broken or not. Already 489 pips for now.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
It may cause strong reversal. Any breakout could be valid, though market can prove it otherwise again after breakout- funny market

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Am finally out of AUDNZD long, enough pips . It's reacting to strong resistance and stochastic already crossing. If it leaves overbought I would join the bears. The would form double top

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Strong breakout in the making on AUDNZD

--- 帖子 #528 ---
wow 9jatrader, I have gone through this whole thread and is very instructive. I will now try this strategy also keeping tabs on your other thread. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
You're welcome. Backtesting it over and over you would be able to see clearly the strength and weakness of the indicator

--- 帖子 #530 ---
EURO seems set for bearish next week. Getting out of this bullish

--- 帖子 #531 ---
GBPCHF stochastic is on overbought region and there is resistance at hand. There is high probability of breaking the resistance

--- 帖子 #532 ---
GBPCHF latest move showed how Dragonfly/Pin Bar could move price strongly when formed on strong support. It had no difficulty making 680 pips in less than two weeks. The analyses and the chart are in the other thread. I decided now to bring the pair to this particular thread because am waiting for stochastic-based setup

--- 帖子 #533 ---
EURUSD 4hr : Stochastic is currently on the overbought. The main and signal had crossed each other.No one knows the direction now. If it can successfully leave the overbought region we may have short trade setup. I see more bearish bias because the signals had crossed each other

--- 帖子 #534 ---
It finally gave a sell signal, though little bit late. Stochastic is leaving the overbought and price failed to break the resistance in focus. It was able to form shooting star, 4hr

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Since EURUSD refused to move on the daily I have to find a way to collect few pips, though I remain bearish in the long-term on the pair on daily. I hope to remain bullish and bearish on 4hr

--- 帖子 #536 ---
NZDUSD stochastic setup making it's way. Stochastic is already on the oversold region and there is already support level at hand. Any breakout could be valid. I see the high probability of breaking it. This is because it's correlated pair, AUDUSD has not done its job completely. Watch out !!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #537 ---
The level had failed to be broken since June, 2016. It has been a potential support since the. The zone had been retested on three occasions and the attempt to break it was unsuccessful. I see it breaking this time. It may move sideways for a while or will just break it without difficulty.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
80 pips just got triggered

--- 帖子 #539 ---
More bearish pressure on the level, 0.68425 on NZDUSD- interesting. Mr Stochastic still resting on the oversold

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Stochastic is currently on the oversold region on EURUSD on 4hr , and there is support at hand. If bullish candle can show up and stochastic successfully left the oversold we may have bullish trade. Only on the 4hr

--- 帖子 #541 ---
NZDUSD ( DAILY ) AND EURUSD ( 4HR ) being waited for on stochastic

--- 帖子 #542 ---
4hr has broken the support in focus while stochastic still remains on the oversold. The end to EU bulls

--- 帖子 #543 ---
NZDUSD breakout not too impressive yet on daily

--- 帖子 #544 ---
NZDUSD failed to break the weekly support, though I have been in long position before now. Stochastic still remains on the oversold region.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Going back and reviewing our past trades is as important as planning the trades. Sometimes we find that we have exited either too early without allowing the trades to hit our target or we failed to exit when necessary. I often use the recent resistance on the weekly to exit my long on the daily. This has come to be working after ignoring the resistance for greed

--- 帖子 #546 ---
But how many traders keep trade journals??? Big question. It's your additional mentor. It can be really stressful at the beginning, but rewarding

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Market opens one late from today

--- 帖子 #548 ---
For two weeks AUDUSD formed strong support. Both bullish and bearish candles lined up along the support. There is higher probability of bullish bias now. This is the fact that the more frequent support and resistance are retested the stronger they're.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I decided to join the EURAUD bulls. It's all about strategy, not profit and loss

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Good night

--- 帖子 #551 ---
AUDCAD on minor support on the daily while Stochastic is still on oversold. It's correlated pair NZDCAD continue retesting support following the strong hammer formed on 20th October The hammer on AUDCAD was great. Also talking about hammer , the hammer formed on the weekly on EURUSD is going well today

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I have found so funny about movement of currency pairs. Sometimes all the currencies of lower interest rate become bearish and some other times all become bullish, while the ones with higher interest rate act same. Just looking for the ones to earn interest rate, but cannot find them

Hi Erebus...do you also use Low/High or did you change that to "Close"? Attached Image

AUDCAD crossing the support while stochastic still remains on the oversold. Any good breakout may possibly invalidate Hammer formed on NZDCAD

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I will be sharing charts more when exiting my the positions I took

--- 帖子 #556 ---
AUDCAD forming strong Pin bar on support. If today closes well that would validate the NZDCAD strong hammer already formed

--- 帖子 #557 ---
NZDCAD and AUDCAD no longer reliable the support broken. No direction for now

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Three losses in AUDCAD . AUDCAD had not been good to me in recent time

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Awaited setup on the weekly- AUDCHF . Stochastic already left the oversold region. Hope to use the combination of the other strategy to get in. For now no entry point

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Fulfilling the entry point using the twin strategies on the twin threads I believe it would reduce risk. I hope to use the twin threads to share the analyses. I would also give clear signal on EURAUD continuation- am not already in yet

--- 帖子 #561 ---
The pair remains unique for me now as it's very rare to use the twin strategies to get in

--- 帖子 #562 ---
In case the AUDCHF and EURAUD makes strong bullish and bearish setup, I would prefer AUDCHF short as this had not closed above the upper band. Except EURAUD makes "very" great bearish continuation

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Middle band still obstructing the AUDCHF bullish move on the weekly. How long will this continues?? Time will tell That's the reason the daily also still rejecting the upper band. Maybe after Christmas when traders are fully back again

--- 帖子 #564 ---
The same middle band on the weekly is also responsible for the bullish retracement ( daily ) on USDJPY short.

Stochastic-based GBPUSD short in the making. How far will the movement go?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Price has failed to break resistance 1.35855 ; this is a great setup as this could form double tops with Bearish Engulfing Pattern. Trade safe as no setup is perfect

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Price has broken that resistance level, Weekly in clear overbought Daily not quite there strongly yet what you think mate? Cheers

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I believe you're subscribed to me. I have said something about the pair and EURUSD . Check the other thread- Page 112 #2238 . Try and follow up as I adjust my expectation and bias

Am already bullish on GBPUSD and EURUSD ,check the other thread and see the lesson i have learned and have shared there

Hi 9ja what do you think of eurgbp at a support?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
very very sorry for having been away from the thread for long time now. I have been out of the thread since I have not found setup on stochastic. You should have shared the chart in the other thread. So sorry

--- 帖子 #575 ---
There is stochastic based setup in the making- EURAUD weekly.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Stochastic is already going overbought. This level remains a decisive point as Double Tops setup was formed at the level before now. Either break or reversal

--- 帖子 #577 ---
If reversal is formed I feel it would be better than trading the breakout as the pair had, for long time now, been trending

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Resistance breakout on EURAUD means Support breakout on AUDCHF

--- 帖子 #579 ---
If SMA on AUDCHF crosses the middle band and the pair is able to break the support it would be great

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Good night

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Good day 9jtrader. I want to express to you my immense gratitude for the selfless efforts you have put into making available to us all your trading strategy. I have used this week to go through every post here in this forum from the beginning to the end. I have some concerns I would like to bring to your attention, and as usual I hope you find time to do something about them. They are as follows:- (i) - The title of the forum " Method of using Stochastic Oscillator Profitably " attracted me because I have recently incorporated Stochastic into my trading strategy ans was studying all I can come across on. While all you have done here is quite inspiring I however observed that in most cases when you make post you make reference to stochastic but the chats reflect more of Bollinger Bands as more often than not you have the Stochastic diminished. Please do let the stochastic show as well so that one can clearly see your reasoning and follow (ii_ - Seccondly I do realized that you have another thread/forum (which I have not fully gone through yet but will) and you seem to have given more time to that at the expense of this, although you recently started posting here. Please do try and post here regularly as well. From the few I have seen in the other thread/forum " Simple and profitable trading style " you are basically doing the same thing in two places under different headigs,; if so may be you should closing one and focus on the other so that your infos are in one place. (iii) - I have not seen anywhere in this thread where you have clearly explained the details of the strategy. The thread would be richer and more rewarding with that done if possible at the beginning. Once again I really appreciate your efforts and all I have learnt. I hope to possibly start posting here soon, although I am an intra-day trader executing my trades on H4 &amp; H1 Tfs. I don't know if that will in any way contravene the intents of this forum, please let know so that I don't offend you. Thank you so so much !!!

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I have read everything you said. The strategy doesn't need any complexity. You talked about not explaining in detail. Very simple. When market is on/around strong resistance and stochastic is on the overbought, wait for the break or make. Either breakout- the we join the bulls. If there is a great setup for bearish, then we join the bears. Opposite is the case for oversold region- we use support breakout You said am not as regular here as in the other thread. You're correct. Sometimes I apologize when I have to reply friend's post on this thread so late. I say apology to you also. Please next, "Quote" my post in this thread or shout on my profile. I would see it in my Profile even if I have not seen setup based on Stochastic. One of the reasons am not as frequent as in the other thread is that I have to see convincingly that both stochastic and overbought matched. Ordinary breakout without stochastic, I don't post it here, but in the other thread. Bollinger Bands is a different case. Any concern let me know. Now I have EURNZD on the overbought. That was what drew my attention to the thread

--- 帖子 #583 ---
EURNZD around resistance area and stochastic on the over

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Learn to shout on my profile when I failed to reply your post, specially on this thread. Maybe am distracted by the other thread because there are many other strategies incorporated into that thread and I have mentioned the reasons to join them into it. The reason is that I don't wish to have more than the threads I already have. Whenever other strategies present setup other than the main strategy there, I always indicate I can't stay away from the other thread- Bollinger Bands

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Thank so much bro

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thanks for joining us

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Just found that there had been consolidation support breakout while stochastic remains on the oversold region on NZDUSD . It's also supported by the weekly middle band and daily lower band closed candle. I hope it hits 254 pips

--- 帖子 #588 ---
So this could have been a missed set up? Which should have been your entry candle - the one preceding the vertical blue line marked candle or the the candle which my vertical blue line is on. I asked because the preceding candle broke the resistance but by then Stochastic was not at the overbought region completely yet.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I don't understand what you meant by the " ... If there is a great setup for bearish, then we join the bears".

--- 帖子 #590 ---
And another ?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
...................Which should have been your entry candle - the one preceding the vertical blue line marked candle or the the candle which my vertical blue line is on. I asked because the preceding candle broke the resistance but by then Stochastic was not at the overbought region completely yet......... I think per system's rule, the entry of BUY should be at the close of the breakout candle coz the stocs is on or above the 80 level and the price has broken a major resistance. So the tendency of price direction is up.....

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Thanks Fxenthusiast. But by breakout candle do you mean the candle that broke through the resistance (in this case) or the candle that breaks out of Bollinger Band? Like as in the case of the EURUSD below, is candle "A" the entry (it breaks out of BB and a minor support) or candle 'B" (which breaks out of BB at the major support? Both occurred while Stochastic is below the 20 level.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Am I getting this correctly? I mean is this trade correct based on the system?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Sometimes great bearish setups, like Shooting Star, Bearish Engulfing Patterns, Gravestone Doji form below strong resistance. Then we join the bears

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Missed. You get what I mean

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Mind you. Some S/R are choppy and are created by small fish in the market, not the big boys. Not clear about this your support. How did you draw it??

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Great thanks. I appreciate

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Not all S/R are S/R. I mean it. I mean "I visible" S/R when I say visible S/R.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Where and when posts seem confusing we can re-read the posts and the charts again and again.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
The flips:- A =&gt; It acted as Resistance B =&gt; It acted as Support C = It acted as Suppoer and D =&gt; it is actually a Round Number Again I am still learning if you have any insight wrt the kinds of SR created by Big Boys in the market it will be helpful to provide a little guide. Sorry of bordering too much

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I think I get your point wrt this; B should have been more preferable to A. It is more obvious. Thanks for your kind guidance

--- 帖子 #602 ---
There was even a support between B and C. There were many S/R too close to each other and never knew which one market would respond to. That is the reason I said some are choppy.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Ok. When we go through our charts we would notice that some S/R levels are so clear and I feel more comfortable with them.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Nobody is bordering me because he/she asks questions. We are all learning together. I have seen many occasions when readers here and the other thread helped to answer some questions even before I came online.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
NZDUSD - stochastic supported breakout seems valid now as it goes down.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
How will the resistance level, 1.00393 respond to the strong bullish movement. Stochastic already on the overbought region. Would the be breakout while Mr Stochs remains on the zone? On my side am running away first with the 365 pips and see the outcome of the breakout It has high probability of breakout because the correlated pair, EURUSD just started its strong trend by breaking out of ranging

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Been squeezing it out of Gold for a few days now. Watching to see what happens at the next support to decide to either add or pack up the trade (probably taking a reversal trade). The current inverted pin bar does not deter me much due to the fact that it was largely as a result of the news from US today, so I am holding my position especially given the weekly tf encouraging PA (and BB is squeezing there as well)

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Gold is going down. It is positively correlated with EURUSD , AUDUSD and negatively correlated with USDCHF

--- 帖子 #609 ---
EURUSD and Gold forms same setup sometimes. They formed same Bollinger Bands Squeeze and have broken out of the same period. EURUSD gown 260 pips now

--- 帖子 #610 ---
CHFJPY is a near perfect beauty !!!

--- 帖子 #611 ---
You caught this move . Good luck

--- 帖子 #612 ---
USDCH F continues resting on the overbought region , weekly and daily. How will the resistance breakout be? But the correlated pair, EURUSD still crashing. Any bullish move on EURUSD could be fake- nothing but fake bullish move

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Mr stochs still remains on the overbought on USDCHF

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Stochastic traders I have this- AUDJPY

Bearish Engulfing was formed below it and have to close the long position and scalp 137 pips ranging movement I have to close my NZDJPY l ong also because of correlation

I have to close the position. There is possibility of strong retracement Here was the beginning

--- 帖子 #643 ---
This pair ( AUDNZD ) was greatly helped by RBNZ interest rate spike.

Stochastic remains on the overbought region. The breakout was great, but am already out

--- 帖子 #645 ---
I received shut on GBPAUD short on Stochastic-based breakout . Though the breakout was more than impressive, it retraced strongly. Waiting on the SMA/Middle band and see how market reacts. Still keeping my bearish bias.

The SMA-based bearish ( GBPAUD )setup on the weekly still strong and not yet violated yet

EURJPY on the oversold. Am already out: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post11361130 . GBPJPY down 251 pips since the formation

--- 帖子 #650 ---
My intention this morning was to move the EURJPY TP lower and wait to see how market reacts at the oversold. Only to find before doing that my TP already triggered- not bad

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Am back again on GBPAUD short. SMA on the daily informed me to come back

--- 帖子 #652 ---
AUDCHF is failing to break the strong support level, 0.71539 while Mr Stochastic is on the oversold region. This support had failed to be broken since 5th June, 2017. I decided to join the bulls, live and demo. The weekly is much more stronger, though we still have 23 hrs before weekly candle finally closes. The weekly is currently forming Hammer with bullish body , supported by strong Bollinger Lower Band breakout.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Trade safe. Am just analyzing

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Good night

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I may share the weekly chart if it finally closed well as it's currently too strong.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
4hr is already doing great around the bollinger upper band, though I got on the daily

--- 帖子 #657 ---
What is your view on eurgbp?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Bullish on the daily above SMA, but may not go far. There is already strong resistance, 0.90331 that it's finding it difficult to break. Maybe for scalping purpose

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Here is the resistance obstructing it now. The high price of the Shooting star https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post10385020

--- 帖子 #660 ---
The weekly becoming stronger before market close. I hope continues, though I will not add to the position I have taken on it ( AUDCHF long )

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Here is the weekly chart

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Already shared the chart as I promised. The setup is just too strong on the weekly. The reasons are that it was able to close while on the strong support, it has Bollinger lower Band breakout and above all it was able to close with Bullish body. Trade safe . DON'T BE OVER CONFIDENCE AND KEEP TO YOU RISK APPETITE

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Dear 9j, Could you please llok at this chart, the bar marked by a red vertical line. Mr.Stochastic run outside from the oversold area AND (or but) the price bounced up from the low b-band. Can we read it as a signal to buy with TP at the MA? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I do not see anything about stochastic signal. The breakout that was formed became " Fakeout " and went bullish again

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thank you. Let me ask more: 1. So, you look for breakouts only , not for bounces from supports, bands or MAs? 2. Stochastic's coming out from oversold - is it not a buy signal? 3. How do you filter fakeouts like this one? With higher TFs only or something else?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
1. Breakout only- read the thread again 2. Go through the thread at the beginning 3. No one can determine fakeout. Sometimes breakout moves accordingly and move straight to the direction; sometimes a fakeout

--- 帖子 #403 ---
When you join new thread it's wise to read some posts and study the chart from the beginning. We may not be able to read all, but read few from the beginning.

1hr trading - stochastic supported resistance (0.71292) breakout on AUDUSD
