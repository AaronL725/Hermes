Here are the indicators for a manual system. Explanations, rules and trading ideas are coming... . (2009.05.13) Attached are the current indicators, templates and documentation. (DashBoard v2.5) . Remark: - The DashBoard refresh the informations each minute, consume many CPU resources and disturb the active charts. The solution is to start Metatrader two times: On one platform set only the DashBoard, and on the other platform can you trade. - Or, an other solution is to run the DashBoard on a second computer. =================================================== Version 5.1 Dash Board and indicators (2009.06.14) Files: BasketTrade DBEAv5.1, BasketTrade DBIndiv5.1 BTrOsc, BTrATR, BasketTrader HiloLines, smHull Mavg, smEmptyWindow . 27.09.2017 =========== Here a source codes.

The System DashBoard with two options for the signals. .

--- 帖子 #3 ---
The DashBoard has a little bug. Please replace.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
This looks like the SLOT MACHINE I saw on another forum. Do you wait for the colors to match on all 3 chart periods to enter a trade?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Version 1 - with highlited trade confirmations, only if the upper time frame has the same trade direction. Version 2 - ranking of the absolut values of the trend slope, calculated for the last 4 bars. 1000*(Hull[0] - Hull[4]) / Hull[4]

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Can you briefly explain the indicators u used and how to read the dashboard?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks, Swing Man. Can you give an example of how to trade it?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Swing Man, So how we use this dashboard to enter trade, if use 5 min timeframe?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thank you SwingMan...looking forward to your directions, and insights. RR

--- 帖子 #10 ---
- The DashBoard with the H4 Timeframe attached. - Please download the last version 2 (I haven't add v2.1). Because I developed the DashBoard on this weekend, is possible that some bugs appear for live prices. Also I haven't the possibility to check the alerts. A short description of the system is attached.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
H1, D1 charts and templates. .

--- 帖子 #12 ---
DashBoard version 2.1: - some bugs on drawing arrows and figures are fixed. .

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Swingman...Just read through your explaination sheet...Looks interesting...looking forward to giving your method a run. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Swingman.. could you please post an MT4 version of V1 &amp; V2 Dashboards ...EX Versions cannot be loaded into Metatrader. Thanks and regards

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I have no difficulty loading the .ex version of any dashboard into metatrader. Insert in indicator folder, and restart the platform.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks ...it is working correctly now

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Looks good.. but how we trade with this...?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi swingman ...When you have a strong uptrend number but the arrows start to disappear do you wait for a change of arrow direction or change of trend number to bail out. Thanks for all the wonderful work you've done so far.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Swingman ...I have another question relating to the Trend Ranking ...does the minus sign mean anything preseeding the number and does the Dashboard sort in a preferred order automatically. Thanks once again for presenting such an interesting method.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Swingman , is seems that this your system isnt compatible with MT4, because its light in MT4 is off. please post a version of this system that is fit to my MT4 best regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
In post#5 I wrote: ...ranking of the absolut values of the trend slope, calculated for the last 4 bars. 1000*(Hull[0] - Hull[4]) / Hull[4]

--- 帖子 #22 ---
So i guess that if its a ranking the strongest trend ranking is the one shown at the top and the weakest trend rank at the bottom?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Please read short explanation WORD document again. IT is all explained there.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Please re-read short explanation WORD document again. Refer to this as your answers are there already. DAILY TREND COLUMN.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Pleeeeeeease Cosmo! For such questions is not place in a professional forum like FF.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
DashBoard version 2.2: - some bugs on drawing arrows and figures are fixed.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Nice job, SM. Why are my trend rankings so far to the right?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
This is a problem of programming. You must move the right border until the D1Trend values comes under the title. This is the only possibility to have right adjusted figures in the column. If I find another solution, I fixed the problem.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
For the lower time frames (M1, M5, M15) are shown hourly period separators. .

--- 帖子 #30 ---
It is a previledge and honour to have helped put this document together for Swingman. Thank you Swingman.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
don't u think it's too much of a distraction by looking at so many pairs at the same time?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Surely are you right ! I am very older one, and the only distraction in my age are slot machines like the DashBoard. I know, you are a young man, and you know without seeing any chart - which pair is the best to trade and has the best trend - if we have chosed a pair to trade, if the time to enter is now, in one hour, or in two hours. - if the trends on upper time frames supports our trade decision in the current time frame or not (like Dr. Elder with his triple time frames, or other autors) The system IS a triple screen system: trading on H1, entrys on M5, confirmation on D1. - At the time I'm not a rich man, and with my money management can I set only $10,000 on the best 3-5 best placed pairs and wait what happened. The rest of 15 pairs are ignored.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thank you swing man , I love it ! Very well thought out . Respectfully , Tom

--- 帖子 #34 ---
hi swingman, thanks 4 your reply. if u trade this way n r comfortable with it n it works 4 u. then carry on, if the results that u get r good, then it's icing on the cake. every1 who knows u will b happy 4 u looking 2 learn more about the way u trade. trade well

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I agree with your method 100%. 1. Every trader knows TREND IS YOUR FRIEND TILL IT BENDS. You have thought and chosen very good trending indicators, researched the settings and combined these into one system. 2. Every trader knows trading with the HIGHER TF PARTICIPATION is the way to profitable trading. You have provided this MTF system with the dashboard all at one glance. 3. Every trader knows and prefers SMALLEST POSSIBLE DRAWDOWN as possible. This is achieved by TIMING ones entry on the smaller TF. The dashboard enables traders to do this at a glance. 4. Every trader knows that one cannot TRADE EVERY SIGNAL that presents themselves. Your dashboard with the DAILY STRENGTH COLUMN helps determine and choose the best pairs to trade at a glance. Even though the dashboard looks overwhelming at first, its flexibility in the inputs parameters is customable to each trader's comfort style. To have email alerts which these days can be converted to SMS on mobile phones as well as popup alerts means one is not glued to the PC, encourages mobile trading so one can trade anytime anywhere even when shopping etc. The dashboard has clocks showing the amount of time left for each timeframe. Even an input feature to alert you xx mins before the close of candle. This gives time to check your chart when and if many signals appear at the same time. A further icing on the dashboard which in ingeniously added by master programmer Swingman is the little arrow in front of the row indicating when that TF is in agreement with its corresponding higher TF, ready to trade all at a glance. I am looking forward to demo trading this lovely MTF system, made easy with the dashboard. Swingman's generosity to share all this FREE for the community is noted and appreciated. Thank you are two little words with big meaning.

Very well put lrathi, and a BIG THANK YOU to you SWINGMAN. Freddi

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hello, I have problems to add the dashboard properly to the chart. If I add the indicators v2 or v2.2 manually, it is not showing any numbers or arrows. If I load the template supplied with v2, it loads, but I think it is not correct, since the list is perfectly sorted alphabetical. And the D1 Trend numbers perfectly match with the screenshots from the pdf file. I will attach a screenshot of what it looks like. Can somebody post a working template with dashboard v2.2 please?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Oh, looks like all the template is doing for me is loading the objects.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Try this: .

--- 帖子 #40 ---
No idea what I am doing wrong, but it is completely static also. I am going offline now, so I wont reply for 8hrs now. Thx for your support

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks to Swingman for this wonderful toy! Well done! And thanks to lrathi for the precise description - just as precise as the manual of a lovely fighter-jet. Bit technical for chaps like me. Questions from my side: Which TF should the dashboard be attached to? And which tpl should be used (Hourly, daily, or each for its special TF)? Within the chart, the lower right corner trade position word (short or long or L1, L2....) is the valid value for the timeframe of this chart. Would it be a good idea to show there the trade direction of the other timeframes as well? Just by saying in red or green H1 H4 D1? And only the actual timeframe has the extensive grading (Short, S1, S2 .....)? Thanks Forex37

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi SwingMan, fantastic job! I just wanted t ask what asctually signals S1, S2,, L1, L2 mean? and how do u determine TP and SL? thanks, Sergey

--- 帖子 #43 ---
1. - Please read the documentation 2. - No TP, because we trade the trend: M5 -&gt; H1 -&gt; D1 -&gt; M1 -&gt; Y1 http://forexmoments.com/forums/image...es/biggrin.gif or the counter trend: M5 -&gt; H1. - As SL I would take the Hilo moving averages, with setting a break even if the trend is favorable.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I cant make this work which is very frustrating as it looks brilliant. I have attached a screen showing what I get, can someone tell me what I am doing wrong? Thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I think you have not installed each and every file. With SINGMAN`s creations often a latter file is NOT a replacement but an update that requires the previous file to work properly. SO you better start with the files from post 1 and just procede and install all of them. Regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks Forex37, you were right all working now.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Swingman: Thank you for sharing with us. Someone told me about your new method. I'm going to try it. Steve

--- 帖子 #48 ---
A possibility to scalp on the M1 time frame: - We have the long conditions (signals) on H1, M5 and M1 full or partly fulfilled. - Entry 1 point above the High of the previous candle, with initial SL on the red MAvg. - If the blue line cross the entry level, set SL 1 on the red line - If the red line cross the entry level, set SL 2 on the entry level (break even) - Exit on open if the close of the previous bar is below the red line. Result (3 digits broker): 149.505 - 149.365 = 140 points 140 - Spread 73 = 67 points (or 6.7 points for 2 digits broker)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Very nice, SM. I have to review the thread again. I think I have an old dashboard.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Here an other example, with 4 TF conditions and scalping on M1. I do not recomand M1, and think is better to take as trading time frame M5. BUT, the entrys must be taken from M1 , and the stop loss levels (red/blue line) from the M5 time frame. I post here the last indicator versions. (Please take from posting #1 the other indicators, if you haven't do this). - Here an other M1 scalping example with a counter on the first TF, if the signals on all time frames are convergent (column after current price). Also is possible (see input parameters) to become the signal counter for M5, although the first column is M1. (Please test...) - Alerts are fired if the signal counter is [1]. It gives little differences between the histograms in OscD1 and DashBoard signals, but this is not important. .

--- 帖子 #51 ---
SM, in the post above, why in the dashboard is the M30 column not magenta like the others for usdcad? Seems all the rules are met for magenta. Please correct me if I am mistaken.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
This is my experimental trade using D1 H4 H1 Timeframes on a demo account. I could and should have got in earlier at the H1 signal which in this case I did not. I have not decided what SL and TP criteria I will be using at this stage. This was using the dashboard 2.1 version, signals set 1 bar ago. Apologise for the Dashdash data is not ideal as I tried to reset the dashboard after market close. The intention of this example to show that 1. it is easy to decide the currency pair using the DAILY trend column 2. Flexible to use H1 entry 3. How profitable forex trading has been made with Swingman's new strategy and dashboard. I will install the latest dashboard version 2.3 and continue this coming week.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
The problem appears only on weekend, because we do not have refreshed prices. In this case you must restart the indicator.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
In the new version 2.4, beside the arrows is writen the value of the recommended entries: Long = High prev.Bar + Spread + 1P Short = Low prev.Bar - 1P - An other scalping example: .

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thank you for posting your system. I am trying to setup the DashBoard v2.4 indicator.if can i only use it to decide strength?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The daily trend column will help with trend strength. You are in the right place. Version 2.4 has more brilliant features programmed. Watch this space for the explanations. Coming soon!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
SM, I've finally had a chance to closely read the thread and I have to agree -- brilliant work. Very well put together. I particularly like the crossover entry. And the dashboard brings it all togeher with adjustable TFs. I'm not seeing the buy/sell levels with the latest dashboard, but maybe that's because the market is closed. And there's still a few things on the dashboard I'm not clear about -- like the light blue or magenta "1" -- but I'll work with it next week. I've seen other dashboards you've done, and always very good work. And thank you too, Irathi, for all your examples and explanations.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You are right, with market closed the dashboard's full brillance cannot be seen. However, I am seeing buy and sell levels on my platform. Perhaps wait for market to open. The [1] column is one of the new features of version 2.4. This is hot off the press and am working on an explanation file to explain. I have to agree the Swingman's dashboards in the past have been nothing less than fanstastic. This one is even more than fantastic, JUST brilliant! Watch this space, explanations coming soon!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Can you show me an example of a buy and sell level you're seeing rigth now? It's not on the dashboard, but on the individual pair chart, is that right?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Maybe at the time is not possible to see current signals, because the signals are not dynamic. lRathi will explain better, I try to explain the signals from the USDJPY charts in my post #54. - We have the last TF = H4, and the first is M1 - At 20:00 on the H4 we have a L2 signal, and in the TFs M1, M5, M30 Long signals. We can see that at the times after 20:00, we have on M1 an entry at 20:36. I have drawn vertikal lines in the TFs M5 and M30 which correspond the time of the entry. Because I will to trade the M5 TF, I set the initial SL, further the SL 1 and the breakout, and wait until the first close cross the red line. Surely is possible to exit earlier.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi swingman , Im wondering if the 1m tf shows up on the new dashbourd or do I need to change one of the settings , Thanks in advance.......Tom

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I don't change the version number. To better see for which timeframe comes the signals, I write in the second upper left row the signal time frame: ( M1 signals, refresh 1 min ) - chart1 or ( M5 signals, refresh 1 min ) - chart2 .

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I don't know if I understand your question... Wait on the explanations of lRathi, and until monday to see the DB working live... The parameter for drawing and/or sending alerts is "TimeFrame_Alert". For "TimeFrame_Alert = 0" we become signals for the first TF. For "TimeFrame_Alert = 5" we become signals for the M5 TF, if this TF is in our time frame list.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
M1 Tf shows up as the default setting in version 2.4. If it does not then in the TIMEFRAMELIST INPUT line add 1 followed by a 'comma'

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Swingman has explained, If you are still finding difficulty, I suggest to wait for market to open. Send your chart and see the solution from there.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Yes, I'll have to wait until market opens. I know what the signals are, but his post said the levels are printed on the chart -- and that's what I do not see.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thanks for your explanation

--- 帖子 #68 ---
look forward to Monday to see this in action. Thank you for showing the value of using 1m entries based on 1h, 5m signals. I'll be trying that. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!! STEVE

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Swingman,Thank you for all the work and time you have put into this system. Iam trying to understand how to know which pair is best to trade as in your ranking. I see some - signs to the left of the trend ranking do they mean abnything ? Also it seems the pairs are ranked most likely trades, ranked best to trade from pair being most likely to be a winner on top and in decending order. Is that right ? Thanks (I did see in one of the pdf files the minus means nothing) It is just confusing me . Thanks for your help

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Have you read me postings? I wrote two times: " ranking of the absolut values of the trend slope , calculated for the last 4 bars. 1000*(Hull[0] - Hull[4]) / Hull[4] " - Still another additional reference : one does not have to trade at any time the pair with the highest trend slope. If the trend turns from short to long, the trend slope values are small. For example the trend is long (+0.30), and the signal still short (arrow in the last column is red). The signals arrows remain perhaps 1-2 bars short, then we see long signals (green arrrows) and the trend is upward turning with higher values (+1.3, +2.4 ...) That is the best occasion to made tourn around trades.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hello Swingman, This is very big and great job you are doing. I really love the visual displays of information. I will appreciate it if you can include an email signal alert to go along with it. TIA. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Thanks, but am I in the wrong film? I work many hours to the program, and you do not even have it started and looked at the parameters .

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Yes, yes, this functionality was made for you!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
With all due respect, if you re-read the pdf document "Full Explanations" and work through the examples you will have your questions answered. I have not only explained the DAILY TREND COLUMN and spent extra time with the examples so Swingman will be spared questions like these. Swingman is a very busy person. Despite this he has provided an excellent strategy with dashboard and a detailed explanation document to help the community. Thanks for your consideration.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
This document Trading Ideas is in addition to the first one called FULL Explanations in Post #30. In this there is an explanation of three new features added to the dashboard version 2.3 and 2.4. Further there are some scalping trade examples. On the last page is the choice of TF to enter your trade based on a harmonic theory of numbers. Again, please re-read a few times as there is alot of detailed information.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This is an update of Full Explanation 1 in Post# 30. More detailed explanation of Daily Trend Column has been added. An update of dashboard version 2.3 and 2.4 explanation has been added. Please read and re-read this document as there is alot of information to understand. There will be further updates if necessary .

--- 帖子 #77 ---
thanks a lot to Swingman for the perfect trading system may i wander if it possible to post the source mq4 files to customize some features and integrate into mts? what is the role for BBands Stop and ArenDI ATR? for trailing stop is used MA so what is the use for BBands Stop, can you write elaborately about ArenDI ATR in taking decision for traing in and out, please, should it not so important then i'd remove it from the graph to save some window space... any ideas?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
could you add some additional params to flexibly customize the Dashboard 1) To make closer two first collumns, to set the distance 2) to make all the columns closer and thus the Dashboard to be more compact by adding a param to do not display BBands Stop value

--- 帖子 #79 ---
@jaya - Abot the role of BBand Lines and explanations about ArenDi_ATR, please take 10 minutes from your time, and read the first page from the explanation file (last version on last post #76 of lRathi). - Surely you can remove the ATR, because this is only for me a visual help for decisions when we have big bars (reversal or pin bar). - At the time I don't post .mq4 files. The system is unfinished. - I will try in the next version to make closer the columns, you are right. Maybe is better to give the width in the input parameters. OK. - I did not understand what is with BBand values? The figures in the DashBoard are possible entrys, I wrote about. If you will to not see this figures, is possible to give this as input parameter.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
With all due respect, you seem to be trying to cosmetically pay more attention to the shell rather than the pearl inside. You have not even tried this brilliant system ( the pearl) and dashboard yet! Use it for what it is designed for first, Financial freedom Made easy. I have never met such a talented gentleman who gives away his talent to help the community FREE . I am personally embrassed to read your post.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
With all due respect to you Jaya, To ask for intellectual property of mq4 version from this generous gentleman master programmer ,I am lost for words! and in shock!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Has anyone actually started to use this yet live and if so any results?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
- At the time I don't post .mq4 files. The system is unfinished. -usually other participants of the thread can suggest some solutions to the bugs and more prompt and sound modifiactions to the code, it'd in many cases require some custom modifiactions to the code to siute some particular purporses, so sources are very wellcome even being unfinished yet - I will try in the next version to make closer the columns, you are right. Maybe is better to give the width in the input parameters. OK. -thanx - I did not understand what is with BBand values? The figures in the DashBoard are possible entrys, I wrote about. If you will to not see this figures, is possible to give this as input parameter. -i mean that after arrows on almost each TF collumn there are numbers (like 1.14933 - i suggest these are BBands values according to the manual) which enlarge the collumns and may nor require to be shown up

--- 帖子 #84 ---
The system was born on FF a week ago(see first post). Perhaps after a week you can be our first contributor on this thread to wave the green flag that you have started trading LIVE . Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
lrathi, let Swingman decide what to do with own property, this is a public thread so this is a public inquery, personally, i'm very interested to support this thread too and take my time to polish the code and modify it without unnecessarily disturbing our grand master programmer

--- 帖子 #86 ---
You are trying to compare a GURU to an avarage programmer. Please read the FF forums and other forums to realise Swingman's work and respect he has earned in the community. The promptness and sound modifications to code is insulting to read. The flexibility of the dashboard is more than enough for majority of traders. - I will try in the next version to make closer the columns, you are right. Maybe is better to give the width in the input parameters. OK. -thanx - [/quote]I did not understand what is with BBand values? The figures in the DashBoard are possible entrys, I wrote about. If you will to not see this figures, is possible to give this as input parameter. -i mean that after arrows on almost each TF collumn there are numbers (like 1.14933 - i suggest these are BBands values according to the manual) which enlarge the collumns and may nor require to be shown up[/quote] Please re-read manual to understand what you assume are BB values are infact Entry prices after the full arrow.No where in the manual it says these are BB stop values. (I should know, as I am the author of the manual). After several dashboards on the forums, your post is the first misunderstood about these entry values. As the author of the manual, I may have to spell out what these values represent. There is an input option to turn off the intermediate signals on the dashboard. Please re-read the manual agian to find this information. I see you have posted only 10 posts on FF. I would love to know where I can learn about your contributions. Please contribute more before you demand more. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
What are your credentials and proof of your skills to help POLISH the code and modify SWINGMAN"S work.? Please JAYA.....

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I have to agree with lrathi. It is too early to ask for code. Swingman has produced an excellant piece of work that is very flexible. He has every right to protect his work from someone wanting to play with it. I'm sure the last thing he wants is for this thread to be filled with different, unauthorized versions of his work -- or worse yet, ending up on ebay.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
You are right, because into a software package for $45 you can find some of my indicators which I developed for free.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
As I promised jaya, here a version who you can change some of the display parameters, so that one gets more compact charts. .

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Just checked Jaya 11 posts on FF( 5 from today on this thread). Press is name and find his posts and make your own opinion.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
thanx a lot Swingman, excellent compact Dashboard, i love it really! in many trading system threads posted on this forum i was easily able to download the source code and customize it, the accusation that these sources would be published at ebay are merely childish in my opinion, we are currency traders not an ebay merchants. Better to reply like that "I want to be a Guru" of this system and deny the desire of anyone else to customize the system to suite own trading plan that may slightly but importantly differ from the original one. This explanation seems to be more fair and correct, imho.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Irathi dont create a panic on this thread please, the question to post the sources was directed to Swingman, if you have created a PDF doc doesn't make you the author of the source code and find the answer on my question on his behalf. It is very silly to judge people merely by posts on this forum... please dont play in this game, i've programmed many mt-systems privately, and consider to spend some time with this system.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Swingman, can you make a periodic sound alerting of the new enrty signal (like every 30 secs or so) untill one will hear it and stop this audible alert, i suggest to make it via global variable.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Yes you are right, the readers of these boards never are anything else than curency traders, it has also never been known any case of a public EA showing up on ebay or a private website for sale. And naturally nobody ever bothered giving away his code. WHo are you, where do you live??? If you have read more than 1 day these boards, you know 1. it is a problem 2. great coders, traders and teachers have left these boards because of their code was showing up at strange places 3. naming Swingmans restrictions and reasoning "childish" is either insulting or fraudulent behaviour. I know I risk a lot from the mod for my comments, but it`s got to be said. Kind regards Forex37

--- 帖子 #96 ---
1. please explain when and where this was a problem, i very rarely heard of that 2. write their names please if you are familiar with the cases (including links to threads where this problem was very sound and horrible), please 3. this was my opinion, if Swingman will feel really serious regarding the threat that some one will publish the code on ebay, as i thought this was a mere joke, then i'm ready to appologize for that. I didn't intend to abuse anyone here.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Folks, Let us stop the argue, Swingman didn't claim that he wouldn't post the sources in anyway, let me hope that he will post mq4 files when the system will be at some stage of completion. Its up to his sweet will what to do in this case, especially after our debates over this issue.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi guys, please do not argue longer about my person. I never said “I want to be a Guru of this system ". That is a large secret that only insidern admits is, and is do not become public. Every programmer can develope a DashBoard without my source code. For a similar DB I posted the SC (PipNailer DB).

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Swingman, i've tried Dashboard version 2.5 but i cant see the currencies - only the titles of the columns without any data (now market is closed), but in version 2.4 was displayed all the data when the market is closed, what is the problem?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
A small program exercise for you: - please program a small code, only with what you will to have, and post the result... We have only few .wav files in the sounds directory. After Start() write 1-2 sound alerts, and tell me whether one hears something...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I don't know. You can try to restart the indicator, the program, or the computer...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Swingman, In an effort to give energy instead of taking it from this thread i have a very small possible contribution for consideraton. I've added a color changing moving average 21 high and low to double remind me not to trade against them. Notice I overlayed my new ma's over yours so you can see that mine do not extend one candle beyond the current one for the "shift" like yours does. Anywho, thank you for amazing programming skill for a system similar to one I have been trading. Hoping to learn more.... The indicators came from FxSniper but I added the MetaQuotes legend at the top so I know how to set each variable. I know almost nothing about programming but have made minor changes as needed on a hit or miss basis. Steve

Thanks Steve for your contribution. "Double remind" is very good! OK, we have the histogram bars, and can't trade if the colour is false. I saw you don't use the indicator OscD1_v2 who I posted. The indicator draws every hour vertical lines, maybe is this good to check visualy the charts. - Your indicators are very good, because you can try if the SMA, or the EMA, or the LWMA gives "better" signals. For the begin I used for the oscillator and for the DashBoard intentionally the SMA as default moving average. If we can say that the system and the signals works satisfyingly, then I program parameters for the moving averages.

I say things the way they are in my opinion,I do not call my post you refer to as panic,but CAUTION. I am free to form my opinions and so is everyone else from posts on this or any other forum. Your posts on this thread have been derogative and insulting and putting doubts about your true intention for asking so early in the piece for source codes. I have read your other few posts on FF, you have shown very little if any currency trading contribution of any strategy to show you are a trader more trying to ask for source codes from others. Your private MT systems is no proof to any of us to your credibility. I for one along with others have been in the forex community for a while, and we can smell when something does not sound right. My posts are read by many, respected and this post no different. Swingman has earned the respect of many of us, and we all have the public right to show our disapproval of asking for his source code from a new boy on the block, even when you asked directly to him. We older traders have proved our intergrity and support each other now and will remain in the future. If you claim you are top-notch experienced programmer, write your own indicators and start your own new thread. See how many will follow you with the example of posts you have posted so far!

Thanks for the 2.5 dashboard SwingMan, and for a system that looks promising. Is it possible to post a new template for the m1 m5 m30 and 4hr charts with the dashboard like you posted on the previous page? For some reason the 2.4 dashboard with the 2.4 template only loads the dashboard and not any other windows. Thanks

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Here a v2.5 template:

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Fanx a lot Swingman, very neat Dashboard, now with this tempalte the Dashboard 2.5 works fine, but with previous one it didn't show anything except the titles of the columns.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
well i'll code the alerting system, whci will periodically sound untill it'll be stoped with execution of other script/// and you'll integrate it into the Dashboard the email is bulky i tihnk to asve mobile traffic better to display info in the title of the letter like: BUY EURUSD 1.36026 SL 1.35600 where SL is the value of BBands STOP taken from M5 TF it'll be also very helpfull to send additional email (plus visual/audible alert) to set SL at break even according to the system's rules on the open positions. can you add in the display params the option to remove the Current Price column, for me that column makes no sense, but leave the n-bars signal info like [1] can you also make an order of the symbols not only by the caluclated strength of the trend, but also by the matching combination of arrows on all TFs like display the symbols with mathcing thick arrows first (order them by matching a thickness of the arrows for all active TFs), i think it is more important than the strength of the trend and it takes time to find these matches out of 20 symbols to monitor them, so better to have all of them ordered and display them preceding the others. another major feature i'd suggest to code is to evaluate about 50 symbols (as will be inputed in the params) and show result of specified number of rows like to show 10 best symbols out of 50 in the Dashboard

--- 帖子 #111 ---
i didn't understand from the document what mean L2, L1, and S2,S1 words on the histogram. can anybody explain it?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
This is the only official explanation: Please reread the document, and check the position of lines and prices.

thank you, it is clear now

the preavious such post was edited several times, so i'm pasting it here in completed idea: well i'll code the alerting system, whci will periodically sound untill it'll be stoped with execution of other script/// and you'll integrate it into the Dashboard the email is bulky i tihnk to asve mobile traffic better to display info in the title of the letter like: BUY EURUSD 1.36026 SL 1.35600 where SL is the value of BBands STOP taken from M5 TF it'll be also very helpfull to send additional email (plus visual/audible alert) to set SL at break even according to the system's rules on the open positions. can you add in the display params the option to remove the Current Price column, for me that column makes no sense, but leave the n-bars signal info like [1] can you also make an order of the symbols not only by the caluclated strength of the trend, but also by the matching combination of arrows on all TFs like display the symbols with mathcing thick arrows first (order them by matching a thickness of the arrows for all active TFs), i think it is more important than the strength of the trend and it takes time to find these matches out of 20 symbols to monitor them, so better to have all of them ordered and display them preceding the others. another major feature i'd suggest to code is to evaluate about 50 symbols (as will be inputed in the params) and show result of specified number of rows like to show 10 best symbols out of 50 in the Dashboard

@jaya The system is complicated enough, to add more functionality. Also you have difficulties to understand the documentation. (SL is NOT the value of BBands STOP taken from M5 TF) - With the SoundAlert I wish you much fun. Please write only one row with the SoundAlert, and tell me if you hear any sound... - To remove the CurrentPrice column is OK - Trend strength column remains. For signal combinations we have arrows. - The calculation of the signals is also for 20 pairs long, and for 50 would be too much (calculation + sorting).

--- 帖子 #116 ---
i didn't say that as per documentation SL is BBands Stop there is no such command as SoundAlert, you are kidding me, right? thats why i'm asking for your code to extend and add more functionality that will meet my reasonings without bothering you and others, but note, i dont demand it from you

Had a low 4h trend value but took it when 1m signaled for 13 pips; also sold Eu/chf today for a small win. Still short in Gu/chf slightly in profit. It had a 6.8 4h trend absolute value so looking for it to do better than the other trades. But in forex "Anything can happen" so will take profit when I can get it too. All trades using the 2.5 version dashboard template Swingman was so kind to post that uses 4h, 30m, 5m and 1m signals. I removed the 1m signal for now to give me more time to examine the chart before the 1m signals. Hey, I'm just learning and am slow. I'm pleased with this method so far. In regards to whether this works, of course it does. Classic moving average trades are already proven beyond doubt to work in the hands of a good technical trader. I am a technical trader wannabe...working on it... Steve chart attached...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Took first profit; I don't know how to stay in a win for a killing; price was testing some 4h previous lows and seemed right to take profit. This stuff works. Steve

--- 帖子 #119 ---
look what I did. got out at 1.67039 leaving 25 pips on the table I could have had in next 10 minutes. But still pleased with the pips I got...still learning what the power of this method is. S

--- 帖子 #120 ---
- Surely works the method. As example, if we make a short statistik of the bars when the Hull average is blue, we have 70-80% green bars. If we have 70% on H4, 70% on M30 and 70% on M5, the win probability Open/Close is 0.7x0.7x0.7=0.343. The loss probability is 0.3x0.3x0.3=0.027. This mean that if we entry long, the chances to win are 0.34/0.027=12.7 higher to win as to loss! - To become signals from M5, you can give the parameter 5 in inputs for "TimeFrame_Alert". In the M1 column you check only if you have a thick arrow, and try to entry below the low of the previous bar.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I didn't realize that. Thank you so much. I added 1m column back and get 5m signals...exactly what I wanted. You have the dashboard very user friendly. Steve

--- 帖子 #122 ---
This is my first trade (demo) using the dashboard v2.5 I am using the TF D1,H4,H1,M15. Attached is the H1 and M15 charts. These have yellow vertical lines shown. On the H1 TF the Yellow line represents when I received a [1] signal. I have set my signal to come on the H1 TF. The yellow line on the M15(entry TF) was giving a thick magenta arrow on dashboard and SHORT on indicator on M15 chart. This represent to trigger the trade. So far I am only watching to see how all the arrows and numbers work on the dashboard and coressponding charts. So far the trade is in progress and the [1] has turns to [4]. Still working on my own STOP and EXIT strategy. My dashboard setting is ShiftSignal=0 (current candle, realtime) Some clarification please swingman. Q1. Does the [1] come on at close of H1 candle when H4 and D1 are all in the same direction? Q2. I enter on close of M15 candle?Yes? I watch the chart. Q3. On dashboard this was the only signal. Even though is is the last on the Daily trend column indicating the weakest trend, I still am following it.This low number of -0.1 indicates a possible turn of daily trend? Yes? Q4. This latest version has a new INPut called Show-RestTimeUnit Close. Please what does this represent? Thanks again swingman.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
can somebody explain whats the difference between Hull average and SMA or EMA?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
@stevewide Try to enter on 5min ONLY if you have the BIG red or green HISTOGRAMS in the oscD1 indicator. My guarantee for the system is only in this case guilty!

--- 帖子 #125 ---
makes sense to me; thanks once again my friend

--- 帖子 #126 ---
what mean curved green/red arrows next to Current price column?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Pleeeeease! Instead of asking, draw the averages and see the differences.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
No, no. You don't receive any other answers from me. Read the documentation and try to understand it. It seems you are to young and haven't patience to read few pages.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Swingman, this question wasn't directed to you only, there are other participants on the forum, who may be kindly enough to answer on it.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
- The numbers between brackets come on Open of the bars, and remains unchanged until the next Open. - Enter on M15 chart, 1P below the Low of the previous bar. Many times we have a short rally in the opposite direction. - We can have a trend tourn for small absolute values. Example: Trend=-0.10, and the first D1 arrow is blue (Hull avg. is positiv) Maybe after 2-3 bars we see a Trend=+0.20, and the trend turns from short on long. But, I think that the pairs EURCHF, EURGBP remain for long time with small values, and don't advance on first places. - With "Show_RestTimeUntilClose" you can see or not the rest time until the close of the bar in a time frame. If we will to have a compact window for the DashBoard, this rest time information take place, and we can tourn it off.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
This is unimportant. It is complicated enough to explain the system features, and I would like to not see newbies asks. For such asks there are many other threads and forums. Please take time for such problems.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
SwingMan, I have read your documentation the first and the 2 supplemental docs, and the entire thread and all the improvements and I am impressed. Thanks for posting a very interesting approach to trading. Regards, Scott

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Swinman, dont call me too young, newbie etc -- keep respectufull distance away from such estimations, if you want to be a brilliant Guru then be it, dont offend me anymore, please.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks Scott! To read this from you, is like to become the Sir title from Qeen Elisabeth...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
- I'm very, very old, and you are young - this isn't an offence, this is the reality. - That you are a newbie, is not a problem. But to ask here about differences between EMA, SMA and Hull, is not the right place. Please. - I don't want to be a guru, and I'm not a trader. This is me first started thread, the system and the indicators maybe still in development for 2 weeks. The readers of the thread are to concentrate on the system and are to bring new suggestions, so that we improve the system.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
enough arguing and taking things too personal for today. Thanks Swingman for posting your system...eyeballing over it it looks very user friendly and promising. GOOD Work! THX Traditeasy

--- 帖子 #137 ---
when 4h, 30m and 5m lined up and I got a 5m signal, I went to 1m and entered when it triggered an entry; had initial drawdown and then steady pip pumping. Reread the pfd files and this thread...realized how much I had forgotten. All my questions are answered when I become familiar with the information...one reading isn't enough. Steve

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Steve, when you say M1 triggered the trade. All you did was confirm that the M1 chart was in the same direction, correct?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
no; I waited till the closed 1m candle crossed the hull as it crossed the 21sma

--- 帖子 #140 ---
oh, that's right, thanks. And then you manage it on the m5, right? If you're entry is on the yellow vertical line, that's one green shade less than the full signal. You're not waiting for the full signal?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Very good anlysed and traded! The system has an mathematically advantage, I hopes that also into the practice well runs.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
You are right! Steve did not wait the full signal on M5! Ai, ai, ai... With the correct entry one hour later, there are also none drowdawn at the trade beginning.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I thought so. If he waited just a little longer, he would not have gotten any drawown. But still worked out good. Steve, are you managing the trade on the M5 with an sl at the red line like in the pdf's?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have a separate platform loaded with another dashboard looking for higher TF signals. I prefer trading the H4. No signals triggered so far today, but I can see that several are shaping up.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Ben: yes; I manage on the 5m and place a sl behind the ema 21 using the pfd rules Swingman posted. I see my early entry causing the drawdown...whoops.....?....

--- 帖子 #146 ---
My dashboard is very slow when it refreshes so I place it on a separate platform all by itself. In the last picture I display you can see how its setup. seems to work well. Steve

--- 帖子 #147 ---
With the DashBoard you can take the time frames: H1, H4, D1, W1 and compare the signals.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
for dashboard upper TF's I use 60,240,1440 and what number for the week? Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I have serious issue with your template containing DashBoard v2.5 - it doesn't refreshes itself at all. Maybe i'm doing something wrong, but dunno what... I also tried version 2.4 but this one halted my MT with critical error and i had to remove this indicator. Any help with DashBoard v2.5 will be deeply appreciated.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
That's exactly what I use, but I also have an m15 to fine tune entries -- just like you used the M1 for the M5.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Separate platform is a good idea. I also got rid of the high spread pairs that I don't trade. Can't tell yet if that made refreshes any faster, but figured it couldnt hurt.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
so you don't use the week? I can't get the weekly column to come up with the others. S

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Weekly 10080 Monthly 43200

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thanks when I add those 2 numbers I get an empty dashboard so still working on this. nothing displayed unless I stop at 1440=D1

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Maybe after waiting few seconds, is all OK: .

--- 帖子 #156 ---
didn't work on another broker's charts either; don't have to use the upper time frames; I like shorter trades; ran out of ideas for now to get it to work anyway. It works great on 4h, 30m, 5m, 1m;

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hey everyone, I've spent the last couple of hours reading the thread and the pdfs and the method seems really interesting. I'm having problems getting the templates to load properly and keep getting critical errors. Is there any chance that someone with a successful template could post a zip file with all the current indicators and a template that loads them properly? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thank you I understand now.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am a higher TF trader. I like trading h4 and daily TF. Have set up dashboard 2.5 H1,H4,D1, W1 without any diffuculty.(demo account) The [1] have appeared on NZDUSD,AUDCAD,EURUSD and [1] on USDCHF, Decided to enter on H1 one pip above previous bar. for NZDUSD and AUDCAD as these are further up the W1 trend. I have left the other two possibilities for now. SL on H4 SMA21 Low. TP is fibonacci based Extention based on H4 which is my trading TF. Due to my lifesytle commitments I am hoping to SET and FORGET after entry and watch only a few times during my wakeful hours. Drawdowns are expected, but with good MM my account should survive. These higher TF ,a trader expects some DD. ENTRY on H1 not M15 (harmonic TF preferred) Re-read trading Ideas document if needed. This is in reply to your post #150. My Posts are expected to looked delayed on the forum due to timezones differences.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks steve for the coloured MA indicators. Have now replaced on my template. NICE to visually confirm trend change!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
This is correct, but ONLY if we have a large green histogram bar (signal = LONG). An other possibility is to find the entry point on the M15 time frame (H1 / 4 = M15). In this case we must have also a large green histogram bar on M15. But the condition on H1 is not so strong any longer, and we can wait until we have a signal L1, L2 or LONG on H1.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Thanks for showing this option of using the Long on M15 with weaker signal on H1. I was thiinking of the Harmonic Number 240/15=/16vs 240/60=4 ,so I concluded entry H1 only. I do not like to enter on such long candle as retracement usually takes place. In this trade I entered after using some previous experienced methods. At present my first TP for AUDCAD has closed for 31 pip profit, the second half still running. $26.65 profit I entered the EURUSD and USDCHF trades by above entry rules and all in profit as I write. Account up to $111.00ish . Not bad for one day. I am excited to keep going!!!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
have an idea; would someone post their template for a upper timeframe dashboard? will try that next since I can't make it work. Thanks

--- 帖子 #164 ---
lrathi, I considered the m15 to be in harmony M15x4 = H1x4=H4, etc. But I haven't gotten any signals at all on the dashboard in a couple days. I just noticed my dashboard is still v2.4. I'l upgrade and see if that makes a difference.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks BenQ, for this explanation. I think I am realising that I did not comprehend the harmonic number theory as well as I thought even though I wrote it in the Trading Idea file. I like forums like this to iron out any new concepts with realtime examples.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I used the dashboard 2.5 template supplied by Swingman on the forum and just changed the timeframes in the INPUT tab "TimeFrameList' to 60,240,1440,10080 My platform does slow down and I am closing and re-opening to get the up to date prices. I am in the process of starting another demo account to only place the dashboard there and trade off the current platform. If you still having problems I will try after the new setup demo and send the template. Let me know.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
please send template at your convenience; no hurry; I am using 2.5 dashboard; its worth a try; Thank you Steve

--- 帖子 #168 ---
@Steve DashBoard isn't working, and I have maybe an explanation... - On my or other platforms is working, OK. - The template has nothing with working to do, because not the template works, this is the DashBoard. This meen that with or without my DB, the problem remain. - But, the DB need historical prices to calculate the indicators, and MAYBE he hasn't any data for some pairs... Try following: - for all pairs, draw in a neutral M1 chart (without indicators) the prices, and make a change to H1 With this action we force MT4 to download price data from server, and later to use this data for higher time frames. I don't know if this help, but for backtests with the Strategy Tester was this a help for me.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I was just going to suggest this. I wrote a strength index a while back that uses several pairs to calculate. I had to load a M1 chart and then use Marketwatch to just change the pairs for every pair the broker offered. That filled all of my history files and it worked fine. I then simply deleted the M1 chart as it was no longer needed. Also, don't forget to right click on the MarketWatch window and select Show All

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Very nice system, thanks for sharing Swingman. I read through the 3 documents yesterday and put on 3 trades this morning. 3 for 3 with low stress using the 1 minute chart to enter the 5 minute signal as long as the higher timeframes is supporting the move.

--- 帖子 #171 ---

Remark: - The DashBoard refresh the informations each minute, consume many CPU resourses and disturb the active charts. The solution is to start Metatrader two times: On one platform set only the DashBoard, and on the other platform can you trade.

Has anyone found that if this method has worked during particular time frames? I normally prefer trading the London and US sessions but was just curious if anyone had any results.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I dont quite understand your question about this method in relation to TFs and trading sessions. My understanding is that it is a MTF method with flexibility of choosing all MT4 timeframes . It is up to the trader to decide what is his/her preferred style of trading,scalping ,short term trader, medium time trader, or long time trader. So far there are examples of sucessful scalping and medium term trading styles on the thread. No reason why it will not be successful for any type of trading style. In regards to trading sessions, this depends on your style, short term ,medium term or longer term. Certainly the EUR and Eur pairs have more movement in the US session and GBP and its pairs during London session. Yen and its pairs during Asian session. Trading session do not matter for the longer term trader, but certainly it does for the intraday trader. This method is independant of trading sessions or any particular TF. What type of trader are you,short, medium or long term? YOu prefer the two sessions you mention, trade those currencies which move most in those sessions. Nothing to do with the method.

I've installed the files into MT4 and have the DB open. However, I get a date and time at the top left which is 2009.05.11 04:35, whereas its now 2009.05.13 It also doesnt appear to be refreshing. Everything else in MT4 is working normally. I have build 223. Any ideas what I may be doing wrong ?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I have downloaded two FXDD Demo platforms . One was originally used for a while. "CALLED" original demo . The second DEMO on the same PC was downloaded yesterday evening (local time) for dashboard only. Called "Second Demo_ Dashboard only". Before removing the dashboard from the original DEMO, I wanted to compare the two. Both Dashboard INput settings are the same except the second has the added M15 TF. Signals come from H4. Not sure what is happening. Will the dashboards synchronise in another day or so? Images attached.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Try the recomandation of smjones in post #169, and click "Show All" in Market Watch. .

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thanks. I've given that a try but nothing changes. I've opened the template on a different chart and I just seem to get the same data almost as though its just picking something up thats preset rather than whats actually happening now. Very strange....Any other ideas ?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I have found the reason for my problem. When I unzipped the files and extracted them into my MT4 folders, they created new subfolders within MT4 and the template couldn't find the relevant indicators. I've now restored them to where they should be and it seems to be working, although taking a long time and taking a huge amount of memory. I shall reduce the number of pairs it follows which should help

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I have on both Demo Platforms followed smjones recommendations. 1. Show All in Market Watch. 2. Primed each available currency including silver and gold from M1 to MN 1 3. Then refreshed both dashboards. Still no difference. 4. Eve in Tools&gt;Options&gt;Charts&gt; Max bars in History&amp; Chart=2147483647

--- 帖子 #188 ---
For different startings we see different signals, because old signals are not taken in consideration. I will this programm in one of the next versions. But in this case, on starting the DashBoard we will have a longer waiting period.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thanks Swingman. May I ask a computer question. Since there this alot of CPU being used for the dashboard, what component on the PC does one need to increase to increase this CPU.? Maybe I can add this to my PC in the computer shop.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I don't know. An other solution is to run the DashBoard on a second computer.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Ok. I have two solutions. Second computer or when I update my PC, ask the computer shop person. I think the RAM and GHZ specification needs to be higher. I have DUO core with 1.86GHz and 2.5GB RAM currently. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Dear Swingman, i'm using Dashboard on the monitor with low resolution, can you add display param to remove Current price collumn, please, i need as compact Dashboard as possible, but dont remove "[1]" signal column (after current price column) thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yes, it comes in the version 2.6, but I think only at the weekend, with other little changes.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi swingman, Wouldn't take less system resources if you were to write the Dashboard as an EA? That way you could only deal with the most current data at any given time. Of course I am assuming you have a while or a for loop to load some index arrays in your dashboard indicator. If this is not the case then an EA conversion might not help the resource situation. Have you thought about limiting the number of bars it looks back to determine it's calculations? just another though on it. Having not seen the code, I am only making some educated assumptions. Regards, Scott Ps, Not needed on my account, as I have a quad core system and it runs fine on it. Just some thoughts I had on it, is all.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Thanks Scott, yes, I thought also to move all in an EA, that can be done fast. For calculations is used in priciple only the last bar, and this is typical for EAs. Sure gives a loop for symbols and a second loop for the time frames. At the time I work with iCustom() for the BB and Hull indicators. I can implement it direct in the source code, this is an other good solution.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi lrathi - your PC sounds like it has plenty of power. Definitely 2.5Gb is plenty of RAM, but I do agree that the DB is very CPU intensive (it uses up 99% at times). I found that MT4 froze every now and then (I am guessing it is every minute when it refreshes). This meant that I often had to wait 10 seconds or more when I click a chart, news item, etc. I copied the entire MT4 directory structure (e.g. "FXDD - MetaTrader4" to "FXDD2 - MetaTrader4" so I then had two instances of MT4. I run just the DB and a couple of charts on the second instance, and the first is where I have the rest of my charts. I've changed terminal.ico on one so I can easily see which is which on my task bar. I use the same account on both - no need to get two accounts. The only problem now is that I have to switch between two windows now to see both the DB and the charts. And of course double the disk space for all the HST files. Some others have suggested that removing some of the pairs that you don't use might help with the performance.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thanks for thumbs up about the power of my PC. I am confident that Swingman will resolve this issue on the programming end of it. I see you are also in Aussie land. Where? I am in Perth WA.

Got it all up and running fine and got a good entry to USD//JPY today. How about exits ? Do you have any strategy for exits ?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
For begin, try to use the SL ideas from "TRADING IDEAS explanations 1.pdf" page 5.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks. At this time I'm only using the DB but I'll look into opening the charts too.

Nice 52pt profit on the USD/JPY but it could have been greater...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
made 42 pips on GBPJYP=$43.95 made 50 pips on eurjpy=$ 52.32 Total: $106.27 This is just 2xTF in synch I am only experimenting with how to master the dashboard signals. Always confirming on charts. With 3xTF in synch, more likely to catch longer trends.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
As @smjones recommended, I rewrite the indicator as EA, and it seems to work better (faster). Please test. The functionalities are the same. .

--- 帖子 #205 ---
1. First placed EA version on second platform "dashboard only". I left the Non-EA version on for comparsion. Both seems to be doing identical things so far. 2. Second, Placed EA version on original platform within a 5-10 min period. Comparing the two EA versions on two platforms, There is a"SPecial Arrow" on AUDCAD did not come on in the original platform. ( THis could be as before the old signal not being picked up, and within the 5-10 min difference, data is fluctuating in realtime) Q1. The 'special arrow' comes on based on H4 TF as i have this setting for alerts on all dashboards. So, once this comes on, it stays on till end of H4 candle despite fluctuations of price in realtime? It does not come on and OFF with price till candle close? Q2. Will it change to [1] when/if conditions are met during the H4 in realtime? ( I think it should)

Your EA in the screen shot is not active. See the frown face? Make sure the tab at the top of metatrader is green and that you have a smiley face on the EA

--- 帖子 #207 ---
On the change of H4 candle (see clocks) the "special arrow" came on the original platform which was started 5-10 mins later. At this stage the EA was inactive on both platforms. My next post will show both Platforms with EA active.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Here is the dashboard turned on on both platforms

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Approx one hour later..... Same H4 candle.... EA active......"Special arrow" does not appear on either platform, However the Non-EA vwrsion still has the special arrow ON/showing.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
@lRathi Please check off the OHLC in chart properties: .

--- 帖子 #211 ---
OHLC was checked on EA version. Now unchecked, refreshed dashboard.... Non-EA version..... refreshed, OHLC..... WAS unchecked. "Special arrow" remains on Non-Ea version. See image. 42 mins left on H4 candle will watch at change of candle.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I know that we have a little problem with the signal arrows... In your DB, the condition for special arrows are following: - First condition: in the TFs H4, D1 and W1 we have an arrow (thin, double or thick) Because in your chart we haven't an arrow for the H4 TF, means that at begin of the period was this arrow - Second condition: if in the FIRST TF (M15) we haven't a thick arrow, we are waiting, and this is an "Early Signal". The problem is that at the time the signals are updated only on new bars in the H4 TF (your signal TF), and remain unchanged. - I will try to improve the algorithm.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
thanks swingman

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Special arrow disappeared on change of H4 candle on Non-EA version. All the same now.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
@lRathi Can you say whether the EA version is more faster?

Yes, and this is to late as information...

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I updated the DashBoard and the Indicators, because the Hilo conditions was not identical... We have now for a first signal in DB or a first histogram in oscillator, the condition (for long): (High[1] &gt; HighAvg[1]) and (Close[0] &gt; HighAvg[0]) .

Dashboard Inputs: Trading TF=240, and Column_SignalEvaluation_MTF=1. Q1. What is the SL value based on? LOW 21 MA on H1 chart? Q2. How is the entry price determined? on H1 chart but how many pips above current price? Q3.There seems to be many repeats od signal within the hour as realtime. Can we have the feature to come at close of candle or better still xxxmins before close of candle as in previous versions? (The reason, with email alerts ON too many emails coming for same alert) Q4. What does[12] refer to on alert near SL value? Thanks Swingman once again for this system and dashboard.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Q1. What is the SL value based on? LOW 21 MA on H1 chart? Yes, the Low of 21 MA from the previous bar. Q2. How is the entry price determined? on H1 chart but how many pips above current price? At the time are 0 pips, to better check the figures. If you will, I can add or substract 1 pip. Q3.There seems to be many repeats od signal within the hour as realtime. Can we have the feature to come at close of candle or better still xxxmins before close of candle as in previous versions? (The reason, with email alerts ON too many emails coming for same alert) I tried to fix this repeated alerts. Now we have live prices and can better observe the alerts. Q4. What does[12] refer to on alert near SL value? In the alert window, the numbers between brackets are the ranking numbers!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
UP 85 pips already. Wow!

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Q2. plus 1 pip I think better. Am not sure about others views. Q3. Look forward to this with LIVE data now. Q4. Wonderful information too! Q1. Makes sense now. Thanks again. My observation on this trade. Many times [1] appeared and disappeared even after H1 closed candle. Even 2 appeared and stay for some time and disappeared. Few hours later, European open again [1] and now 2 has come again. The trade I opened on first [1] and now up to 85pips (fluctuating on present candle)

--- 帖子 #228 ---
UPDATE DashBoard version 3.3 - The bug with repeated signals is fixed - We have now an input parameter: Offset_EntryPoints = 1 For long e.g., the entry in the alert window is then the high of the previous bar + 1 pip . .

--- 帖子 #229 ---
The fluctuation of the numbers in the signal column is normal, because in the period of this hour the conditions changed mybe on H1, or on H4, ... I calculate the current number from the number of the previous closed candle + new fulfilled conditions.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
From yesterday and today trading. Current drawdown with three trades open is Approx $30.00 Still experimenting with exit strategy.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Looks good, lrathi. I don't have anything decent for exits yet either.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
@lRathi Very good trades, and better than my! At present I am thereby for the next version to get earlier entry signals.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Dashboard still set at H4 trading but changed signals to H4 this time. Q1. What does the green [1] AUDNZD represent? So far after [1] or [1] the next number changes to red or green 2 not 1? Thanks

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hi every one,please i need some help, when i try to attache the h1scalperdb_EA_V3.3 to the chart all i have is a black screen, can some one help me with that please..

--- 帖子 #235 ---
- Everywhere appear a [1] we have all conditions for the signal column fulfilled, and we have an arrow in the first column. (Your signal column is 2 = H4) - When the 1 appear without brackets, the first column has not an arrow like AUDNZD in the DashBoard.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Have you saved the file in .../experts, not in .../experts/indicators? This is an EA.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I understand better now. Thaks Swingman. I was observing the H1 signals on H4 trading. This morning I re-started my PC and see this image. H4 trading TF and signals from H4. Q1. So the sequence will be [1] or [1] when H1,H4,D1,W1 all have thick arrows for the first time..... then when there is a retracement on H1 ...the dashboard will give the green or red 1 or 1. What will be next sequence green and red 2 or 2 ? I will have to observe.? Q2. Is the old memory of sequence remembered? Or everytime we re-start computer or change settings we start memory again?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Asking others for ideas on their exit strategy? While the entry and SL values are automatically /mechanically generated... there is a search for a mechanical EXIT strategy. Possible ones which come to mind are a) Fib extention/expansion levels or any other valid S&amp;R levels b) ATR level after trade entered c) Another HMA level. d) set number of pips for PT after entry, depending on TF traded. PRO &amp; CONS: a) Not always find ideal swing Highs and Lows for fibs b) Not get the maximum pips from trend for the trade. c) I favour this one as it is closest to price change with trend. d) Not get the maximum number of pips from trend for the trade. Suggestion: Use the HMA indicator set at an optimised setting for the timeframe traded. Swingman, is it possible to add EXIT @ $xxxx when the colour changes at close of candle to the alert?

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Yes i add it on my expert folder THAT S WHAT I HAVE..

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I suppose you haven't copied the indicators from the .zip file in the indicators directory.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
See image. .....2 has appeared after the 1. I did not remember seeing this when I was observing H1 signal. From [1] or [1] it went to green 2 or red 2 . I think in retrospect because I did not have M15 (next Lower TF from H1) on the dashboard. All good now. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #242 ---

- Yes. The program knows that the previous bar a 1 had, and add a 1 if the conditions are fulfilled. - On restart of the computer the old sequence is forgotten. But the idea is good, and is possible to write the last sequence in a file!

- Yes. The program knows that the previous bar a 1 had, and add a 1 if the conditions are fulfilled. - On restart of the computer the old sequence is forgotten. But the idea is good, and is possible to write the last sequence in a file! Please test: UPDATE DashBoard version 3.4 T he last signal sequence is saved in a file. The solution is not perfect...! As example: You trade H1 until 12:00 hour, and than H4 until 18:00 hour. If you come back to trade H1, the program read the saved signals at 12:00 hour, and this are false at 18:00 hour! With the new input parameter Read_OldSignalSequence , you can enable or disable this feature. The feature is good if you don't change frequently the time frames. Also, on monday you have the last signals from friday, if you tourned off the computer on weekend.

Started with $3000.00 mini account on 18.5.2009 Still lost alot with poor exit strategy. Hope to improve profits with better exit strategy. Ideas/suggestions/solutions are welcome! Some of my ideas are on post# 238. Maximum drawndown was 13-14% of account balance.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
OK, I'm waiting... Until then has I improves the indicator. - In the chart we have a suplimentary Hull Average with period 8 as signal line and for identification of retracements. The indicator has two treshold lines +1/-1, and we can take trades only if the histogram is above/below this lines. If we compare the histograms from version 3 and 4, we can see that with the version 4 we have safer signals.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
In the new version there are still two additional conditions: - the slope of the Hull(8) moving average, and - the bar colour For long trades e.g., we have a signal with default conditions, plus the additional conditions -&gt; if the slope of Hull(8) is positiv and the signal candle is green. With this new conditions is very easy to identify good retracement entrys in trend direction! For a time frame, the new inclined thin arrows indicate that the basic conditions for a trade are fulfilled, but we are waiting on a slope change or on the change of the bar colour. - Please replace also the H1Scalper OscD1_v4 indicator, because I made few changes. .

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thank you swingman, each version just gets better. I have loaded the new versions on the charts and testing

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Yes, agreed and definetely so. Just, coming back to a computer which was returned from service, I really have trouble to install this. Could someone just state, which are the LATEST file sets, and which would be the proper sequence to install them on a fresh chart of a fresh MT4 installation. Thanks Forex37

--- 帖子 #255 ---
As I understand - the latest version for the Dashboard is now the EA 4.1 (beter use the EA only - this is much more faster !) - thre indi has now an actual version 4 too. You can read it in the post above on this site !

--- 帖子 #256 ---
@ swingman - thanks for your system !!! Could you please actualize and post here the word documents wtih actual rules ? And the actual files too - as you did it already earlier in similar posts. Something was remarkable changed - it would be better to fix the rules again more exactly.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
For instance - I like the document "Trading ideas" (good concrete strategies and examples - I think it was for v2.3 and v2.4 ?). Following the proposals and examples from these docs it is much easier to trade !

--- 帖子 #258 ---
My time is very, very limited. If you are interested to use the system, you can contact me (PN, Skype), and I give you the explanations in german...

--- 帖子 #259 ---
This document is being written by myself. There are some delays from time to time. Sorry for the inconvience. I think if you read and re-read all the earlier documents and the posts of the recent changes for each update, which is very clearly explained , one can use the present version EA v4.1 with indicator v 4.0 without too much difficulty. Version 4 has just added two more features to make ENTRY more precise. THe rest is the same. Candle colour and another HMA setting. Please practice a little and experiment with the inputs yourself and see the excellent flexibility the dashboard has to offer all kinds of tradersfrom long term investors to scalping traders. Thanks

-- Great system swingman---i think there's one good way users of the system can avoid whipsaws---currencies move in baskets and if you trade with the strongest(just like your trend strenght) moving currencies at the moment/timeframe, you are more than likely to succeed ---- I think you should consider making a BASKET version(seperate version-i suspect most will switch--lol) of the EA--(basket of currencies with very Good hedge RED/GREEN)=don't know if you have ever been here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=132105 -- that way if you wanna trade single currenncy--just match the trend strenght with the current basket( RED or GREEN ) with the momentum---i think it could be powerful

--- 帖子 #261 ---
- Thanks thaomql4, yes I know the Basket thread, is a very interesting idea. Do you use this system? I have only seen that after the large trend in the autumn, the results was not more so good. - I checked this ideea, and found that the first ten pairs remain everytime on the first 10 positions. Surely, like in the Basket system is better to trade the pairs in the middle of the ranking, to become early trend entrys in a rally. .

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hello Swingman, I really want to say a very big THANK YOU . I started forward testing your system last week, I must confess, it's one powerful system. But what I noticed is that it gives you an Entry signal from a lower TF, which is very good,but no exit signal unless you stick to the screen to monitor the arrows (which might not be too helpful if you are not always around to monitor your screen). So I was thinking about an exit strategy i could use, since the system is a MTF system, entring at a lower time and exiting at higher TF will be very helpful. Like me, I set my chartTF to 15,60,240,1440 with 240 as the entry chart, so I get entry signals from H1(which I believe occurs only if the higher TFs are in the same direction with the lower signal chart, I hope I'm right), i take this as my Entry signal irregardless of the whipsaws that occur, as long as the signal support the Higher TFs, i guess it will be very helpful, if there could be an alert signal(email also) when a higher TF reverses its direction, depending on the one I want to use as my exit TF. For example; If my Entry ChartTF is H1 (just like the ext variable in the EA properties), I could set my Exit chartTF to be H4 or Daily or weekly depending on how long/short I want to trade. I'm more of a medium term trader and I like to take my trades on daily chart. Also I had pretty good success last week trading this way, and i also have positive trades running now from the signals I got on the H1 - Weekly (Demo trade). I will exit my trade on Daily reverse signal (which I devise myself, not too convinient) or end of the week (whichever comes first). I will appreciate it if you can add this feature to the EA. TIA. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
@ayoneeyee - Thank you for the nice idea, because I haven't considered exit signals for this DashBoard. To have exits mean that we must have guilty entrys, and this is more a TradeSimulator! I must think of it. Please post possible trades as you having would like. - Just a remark for your example with the TFs 15,60,240,1440 and 240 as signal TF (parameter: TradingTF = 60, Column_Signal = 3): the signal convergence is calculated for 240+1440 plus the first TF column =15 in this case, and not H1. If you will to have H1 for entry signals, you must take the TradingTF = 240 (default serie H1,H4,D1,W1), Column_Signal=1. --------------- I think that a first possibility for exit signals is for example: - Timeframes H1, H4, D1, W1 - Entry Timeframe = H4: convergence for H4, D1, W1 (upper TFs) and entry signal from H1 - Exit Timeframe = H4: convergence for H4 and H1 (lower TFs), with exit signal also from H1! I think that to wait until signals comes from the upper time frames can be to late. We need chart examples!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Yes it Works-- Patience --thats what most traders don't have and its required by this basket trading sysytem.I prefer to trade single currencies and not baskets, when the alarm goes off and there's a strong trend across the board in the market(say--4hr-1hr-30min-15min--just like your board).Its sometimes difficult to pin-point which currency will have the MOST runs in pips. Although, the systems says the TOP 4 or BOTTOM 4 will have the most runs,but its hard to say in the early stages because even the top/bottom 4 currencies switch places in amount of pips, so it becomes a guessing game---its kind of like that game where you are placed in a phone booth and the fan comes in and you are asked to catch has much money as you can..lol This is where your dashBOARD comes in---if the REDs or GREENs are in control on the T101 dashboard --i will just pick the currency that hasn't fully matured yet- out of the bunch( light arrows or HALLOW arrows i.e early stages) on the H1Scalperdashboard--knowing fully well that it will mostly likely get to the FULL ARROW STAGE. These are two simulated trades for longs and shorts--it was just something i thought of when i saw your system-- PS---i now trade using VSA exclusively--

--- 帖子 #265 ---
SHORTS---i just think with the FULL STRENGHT AND MOMEMTUM-- i think the currency will reach the FULL arrow--

--- 帖子 #266 ---
So having just one DASHBOARD that says it all-- Was my thinking-- BEST.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
- Just a remark for your example with the TFs 15,60,240,1440 and 240 as signal TF (parameter: TradingTF = 60, Column_Signal = 3): the signal convergence is calculated for 240+1440 plus the first TF column =15 in this case, and not H1. This is the part I don't fully understand, Thank you Swingman for throwing more light on it. If you will to have H1 for entry signals, you must take the TradingTF = 240 (default serie H1,H4,D1,W1), Column_Signal=1. Noted, I will change my settings. What about if i want my Entry signal from H4 instead of H1, how do I set that?. --------------- I think that a first possibility for exit signals is for example: - Timeframes H1, H4, D1, W1 - Entry Timeframe = H4: convergence for H4, D1, W1 (upper TFs) and entry signal from H1 - Exit Timeframe = H4: convergence for H4 and H1 (lower TFs), with exit signal also from H1! I think that to wait until signals comes from the upper time frames can be to late. We need chart examples! This sounds like a very good idea also, but don't you think taking both Entry and Exit signals on the same TF might result in taking too many trades? (maybe the convergence will make a little difference though), I believe that the less you expose yourself to trading the less your chances of loosing. I think you should look into making the convergence TFs for the Exit TF an external variable so we can play with different settings and see what we can come up with. I also love the idea of the BASKET Trading system, I only trade the pairs in the basket system, infact thats what I have listed in the H1scalper TFList. Here are examples of trades I have this week, using signals from the H1Scalper EA (I'm always on the road, so I can only trade using a web platform for now, i have the dashboard on my computer at home), I will exit trade on Friday or when H4 or Daily changes; Thanks Swingman and all, Ayo.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
@ayoneeyee Thank you for the explanations. For me was importantly to know how you interpretate the signals. Your charts was very helpfull. Just a remark: for Basket Trading, you must take different lot sizes to maintain the equilibrium of pair movings in the depot! -------------------- Tell me please of the following idea is helpfull for you (or other traders... ). For Basket Trading we need an own DashBoard: - Column 1 - only ranking numbers 1, 2, 3, ... - Columns H1, H4, D1, W1, Entry, Exit - In every TF columns calculate and rank the Basket values like my method in the Excel sheet from the post #261 1. - For every pair add the values for the TFs H4, D1, W1 . Rank this values and write the pairs in the Entry column. 2. - For every pair add the values for the TFs H1, H4, D1 . Rank this values and write the pairs in the Exit column. - Trade long or short as Basket System the first 10 pairs in the Entry column - When a traded pair comes in the first 10 places of the Exit column and has a negative profit, sell this pair.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Thank you again Swingman for your relentless effort. I think this is a very good concept you are proposing. It wil be very helpful in determing the major direction of the currency pairs. If you add email signals for the Entry and Exit it will be great, also, possible Exit strategies could be, if a LONG trade moves 2 or 3 steps below the rank - you either place a SL or take half of the profit and set the rest to breakeven or as you mention, if it turns negative, then you can exit the trade. But, I will suggest that you do not completely put aside this current DB, it's powerful also if you can add exit signals, because this one you are proposing might change the face of this current one. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I tried yesterday a basket with entrys from the first 10 pairs, and the results for today are not bad... I think that a neutral buffer between rank 7-10 is good to take decisions when from this buffer zone a pair go up to 7, or go down to 11.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Great work. I think the neutral buffer will depend on how many pairs you want to have in your list. Also, you don't want to get into a trade late or too early to avoid whipsaw, assuming you have 10 currency pairs in your list, you think a good entry strategy will be the first 5 pairs or the first four, and i was also wondering what the exit strategy will be?, will it be based on if a BUY trade moves below the neutral line or signals from the convergence of TFs?. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I don't know ! At the time I think about a new concept to use our signals in basket trading. Because I haven't experience with multiple pair trading, maybe can you or other members make suggestions. I read again the T101 thread, but I will use an other entry modell (post #261). I suppose that the exit will be a combination from which you wrote above. I know also one or two special proceed for basket trading, and perhaps they come in one of the future versions.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Please find attached the documentation for the next update v 4.1.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I decided to use H4,D1, W1 TF's Signals from H4. Enter in realtime when I saw [1] or [1] against the currency pair. Started the demo on friday the 29.5.2009. Exits are fib extensions/Monthly pivots/S&amp;R. Here is my balance.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Greak work lrathi. You are very lucky you could monitor the numbers, I completely depend on the email signals. I must confess Swingman has done a great job here. The best way to trade with this DB is to define a consistent and reliable Exit strategy. For me,I have my DB set up the same way like you, since i undserstand the concept behind the DB's signals now. I take my Entry from 240 and run with it until I get a close signal form my MA signal alert. So far this is my trade since sunday night; PS: How do I upload my chart like your's, instead of using an attachment.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I am not always able to monitor the numbers, and I am hoping to to able to depend on my email signals which can be converted to SMS on mobile phones in the longer term.This service is only with particular carriers. In Australia it is only 'optus' with certain plans. However, there are companies that do provide services to convert emails to SMS for a small fee. I do agree, the dashboard is giving 100% WIN entry signals and is mechanical along with Stoploss values. The next stage is finding a suitable mechanical EXIT strategy. Please read my post # 238 (on this thread)which I have thrown open a few EXIT strategy ideas. I have discussed PRO's &amp; CON's of each. a) Fib extention/expansion levels or any other valid S&amp;R levels b) ATR level after trade entered c) Another HMA level. d) set number of pips for PT after entry, depending on TF traded. To this list I am adding e) PSAR trailing stop f) trailing stops by xxx pips Please could you elaborate on your MA EXit with alert. What MA are you using? Is it possible to post the indicator on this thread. I would like to test/compare with the exit strategy I am using. Finding an EXIT strategy which can be programmed is the goal. It will complete this wonderful strategy. Your results are also very good. I am not familar with the FX Solution platform, so please tell me what are the trades in RED? In regard to uploading charts like mine... In metatrader platform... I go to file...Save As.... there is a choice.... I save as active workspace or active chart. I save on my desktop and then UPLOAD this file as an attachment. On the FX solutions platform there maybe something similar too. I do not know. Any other traders on this thread.... PLEASE post your exit strategies you routinely use... This will greatly help us all to come up with the most suitable one.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I receive my signals directly on my mobile phone, so i can take my trade anywhere, I just want to see how this works for me this month, if its encouraging, i will move to my live account next month. Anyway, the MA signal alert is an indicator I found somewhere on this forum, i'm sorry i can't upload it now because I don't have that priviledge to downlaod or upload such files on my work computer, maybe you can do a search for it - my setting is just FastMA-1EMA and SlowMA-14EMA. I don't actaully wait for the cross, I close my trade at the end of the week. For me, if its below 14- its a a downtrend and if above -its an uptrend. What I notice is that the ScalperH1 EA has a way of giving signal at the begining of the trend, so i use it for Entry and the MA for Exit. But, I believe that a perfect exit strategy will still be the option proposed by Swingman ... (convergence for H4 and H1 (lower TFs), with exit signal from H1 or convergence for Daily and H4 (lower TFs), with exit signal from H4). I know he is busy now on the new DB he is working on, so i won't want to bug him with this for now. Since the new one looks like it will give easier Entry and Exit signals.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thanks for sharing the details of the EMA exit strategy. Yes, these indicators are easily available. I agree that the EXIT strategy proposed by Swingman is GOLD. I am sure we just have to wait to see the Swingman's Magic unfold in the next version.

Very impressive! $1243.66 Profit in 4 trading days. 1243.66/3000x100=41.42% 2x trades still open EURGBP missed TP by 3 pips. I was not around to close the trade. Approx 2% DD currently. AUDCAD is looking good for profit.(Early warning arrow) Still 100% trades entered went into profit.(EXIT strategy was the problem with EURGBP). Still hopeful will go into profit, but will experience a massive drawdown.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Impressive!!!. I raked in a lot of pips with this DB too. But i'm out of all trades now. Closed out all my trdes this morning around 6am Eastern time. I'm waiting for signals now when there is a defined trend. This DB is awesome if you know how to take your profit. I think with the outcome from last week, I might be going live soon. Thanks Swingman.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Helo Swingman, Very impressive thread. For those of you looking for different exit type strategies and especially basket exit strategies take a look at this trade manager made by Steve Hopwood http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371 He has a section of code in it specifically for basket trading. His usermanual posted in the first post of that thread goes over all the options. If you have any questions please post them in his thread and he will review them. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Thank you for this link. I will have a read of it. In my recent search for trade management I have seen but not used this other trade management EA. http://www.forex-tsd.com/expert-advi...anagement.html I have no doubt that Swingman has his own magic he is working on while we seed these Exit EA links and ideas.

Hello, friend I'm looking for a mulit-time FF method, so I read through this thread,and I found here are a few indicators&amp;tpls. I want to konw which indicator&amp;tpl should I load if I use 1d-4h-5m time frame? Thank you~

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thanks azjeff. I'm using the Trade Manager EA to jump my stops. Its really a good EA.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Here is a new version of the old program... In post #261 you can find the algorithm to calculate the Trend Power of Single Currencies. The native Main Trends of the pairs are calculated with weighting the TF trends. In the next version I programe the automatic trading from the DashBoard on demo accounts, to better analyse the performance of the signals. .

--- 帖子 #286 ---
It looks very interesting. I downloaded and read all the material. The only problem I have is that the dashboard v2.5 seems not updating the prices. I tried all version but prices do not reflect the actual market prices. Does the system require a particular setup in Metatrader? Thanks

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi There, I searched the sites but I was not able to find the above mentioned indicator: Multi Basket Movement indicator. It would be possible to know where to download? Thanks

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Have you read all the manuals and updates? Please re-read them as there is alot of information there. YOu will see you have clearer answers to your questions. Read HARMONIC numbers and trading Timeframes in the manual. Thanks

--- 帖子 #289 ---
What settings are you using to jump stops ? Which TF do you trade? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I'm trading the 240-1440-10080 TFs and alert tf is 240, signal coloumn 1. I don't know if you're using the Trade manager ea, but I prefer the JumpStop feature than the trail stop. Anyway i'm using 50 pips for jumpstop, 50 pips for Breakeven and 10 pips for breakeven profit.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Great work swingman. Quick question - Is the Entry base on the top-half of your basket like in your previous analysis or just the signal from the convergence of TFs?. I think incorporating auto-trading feature will be a great idea also, but it will be nice if you can make the auto-trading a conditional feature like if you want the DB to trade automatically, then you can selelct TRUE in the properties if not selelct NO. Thanks again. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Please update the BasketTrader v3.1 ! A little bug is fixed: the [1] signals in the signal column are correct, but was drawn in the false row, now is all OK. .

--- 帖子 #293 ---
OK, I do this for you... - The little problem what we have is that in a hour candle you can receive multiple signals if the trade conditions are changed. If the program take automatically an entry, then you don't become other entry signals. Without automatic trading is not easy to avoid this. - The signals comes from the convergence of TFs in the top-half of the basket (the first 14 pairs), and this is good so. - Remains an other problem, with the entry signal column: I prefer to take the main trend from the last three TFs, with confirmation from the first TF. Working with convergence of three TFs and entry signal from the first TF is not efficient enough. But I think that you and lRathi prefere to use this setting, is this true?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Q1. Why are you using version 2.5? The lateast is version 4.1 Possible solution : the history data needs to be forced to come ito the platform when you first start up a demo. Read previous posts on this thread how to do it.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Swingman, Q1. Combi Trend: represents average from H1+H4+D1+W1 as shown ? Correct Q2. Main trend represents? W1? Q3. In MAin trend what does (1/3 etc represent)? Q4. Trendpower for Single currencies ? Trend strength? When working dashboard operating automatically your are correct 'I prefer to take the main trend from the last three TFs, with confirmation from the first TF.' When working manually for practical reasons: Working with convergence of three TFs and entry signal from the first TF is not efficient enough. But I think that you and lRathi prefere to use this setting, is this true? This is true. I think the idea from Ayoneeyee to have option to use as EA (AUTO trading) TRUE/false is a good idea. Will need to demo trade both TRUE and FALSE mode to see the performance and practical stuff. In regards to auto trading mode. ENTRY IS auto trading based on H1 with convergence of H4,D1,W1 trend. Will there be an Auto EXIT too built into this version? Is it too early to ask the strategy for EXIT you are programming?? Thanks for all this swingman magic.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
@lRathi in post #285 I give all the necessary explanations... Q2: The Main Trend is a weighted value of the individualy H4,D1,W1 trends. Q1: Combi Trend is a combined trend from the single currencies. Example from the above picture: - for CAD we have a trend power (or a trend strength) = 24.1 - for JPY we have the trend power = -34.9 - CAD hase the position 1, JPY 2, and the combination gives a CADJPY CombiTrend = 24.1 - (-34.9) = 59.0 Q3: value = calculated MainTrend value. - in brackets: first number is the rank of the CombiTrend value; the second number is the rank of the MainTrend value. - This column is only for informativ purposis. The exit strategy is finished to 90%. I have a generally problem to give here detailed information about the algorithms. I see that from hundred of downloads of our files, only you and other 2-3 members give me inputs for further developements.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hello swingman Thank you very much for your brilliant work as Irathi mentiomed that several times. I installed the new version of dashboard , but I do not get all the screen the way you have it

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Looking at your image, you need to read the manuals/documents provided to see what each input represents. Change to true or false to the information you wish to see on the dashboard. Lots of options to cater for all kinds of traders. There will be a couple or so new columns in the last basket version 3.1 which has been posted yesterday/today. Swingman has explained what they represent clear in his last few post answering the questions I asked. I will be writing an update document in the next few days. I feel the information provided is self explanatory, but I do write updates to bring all the information into one document from time to time. Hope this helps, I find this S t a t e - o f -t h e - a r t -D a s h b o a r d needs more than one reading of manuals and the trader needs to experiment with each INPUT variable and see what happens when default settings are changed. This is my best suggestion to learn all the dashboard features.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thanks for sharing this information. Yes , it seems we both trade the same TF's. Also good to have the thumbs UP on the EA etc. Also, Swingman has mentioned what the next versions are bringing AUTOtrading options and EXITS too. Will be demo trading this new basket version and wait for the next lot of magic too!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
The explanation is very simple: your broker hasn't all 28 pairs, with 7 appearances for each single currencie! Also is possible that a broker have not e.g. the pair AUDCHF, but have the pair CHFAUD. Here the DashBoard from my Interbank FX trading platform, with 24 pairs: .

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Please update the BasketTrader v3.1 ! A little improvement, to check the number of appearances of the single currencies in the pair list. See the picture in the post above.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Update version 3.1, please replace. Remark: I don't change the version numbers in 3.2, 3.3 etc. because today or tomorrow gives the version 4.1. - For @lRathi and @ayoneeyee I reactivate the input parameter " Column_SignalEvaluation_MTF = 1 " to can set the signal column on 2, if you don't will to use the default value = 1. .

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thank you for this personal trading consideration.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
@SwingMan Thank you Swingman, for taking the time to answer questions, I know you are a very busy man, i wish i could contribute in the programming part. Also, I'm sorry I don't respond on time to comments. Irathi is doing a very good job at answering questions out there. Thanks man. OK, I do this for you... Thanks for choosing to add the Auto-trade option with condition - The little problem what we have is that in a hour candle you can receive multiple signals if the trade conditions are changed. If the program take automatically an entry, then you don't become other entry signals. Without automatic trading is not easy to avoid this. I agree with you,I don't think 1 hour chart will be good for auto-trading, because of multiple signals coming from it. I think the option could work with something like convergence of 240-1440-10080-for Entry and 240-1440- for Exit. What do you think?. - The signals comes from the convergence of TFs in the top-half of the basket (the first 14 pairs), and this is good so. This is a brilliant idea. Also, I'm thinking of an idea, but i don't know how easy or difficult its going to be for you, the idea is that, if possible, you can incorporate a TRADE/Non-TRADE Zone into it. For example, if I have 14 pairs in my Currency pair list, then the first five pairs, based on the Combined Trend/Main trend will be in the (TRADE ZONE), those will be the tradeable pairs, then numbers 6-9 pairs will be (NEUTRAL ZONE), those are high risk trades, while numbers 10-14 pairs are in (NON-TRADE ZONE). I think this might also give easy exit strategy., so if a pair moves into the trade pair from Neutral zone, then, its tradeable, if a pair moves from Trade zone to Neutral Zone, I could close it or set SL or if it moves from #1 to #3(that could be a retracement), so I could add SL or decide to close, depending on risk levels. Look at it from a programmer's point of view and see if its possible. Thanks. - Remains an other problem, with the entry signal column: I prefer to take the main trend from the last three TFs, with confirmation from the first TF. Working with convergence of three TFs and entry signal from the first TF is not efficient enough. But I think that you and lRathi prefere to use this setting, is this true? Yes,it's true because I don't have the priviledge to monitor my chart, I rely basically on the email signal, so taking confirmation from H1 will be too much signals coming in, and that overwhelms me. So taking trade based on convergence of three TFs and entry signal from the first TF, is a choice I think i'm getting used to now. PS: I started the BasketTrade ea yesterday, loaded it with the same currency pairs I have on the H1Scalper. I noticed signals come faster from the BasketTrader than the H1Scalper. Did you change the Entry signal conditions on the Basket or they are the same? - just a one-night observation though, i may be wrong.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Will do. Thanks

--- 帖子 #306 ---
@ayoneeyee I try to answer short to your answers: - We must wait how function the EA with trades on H1. This is a good TF to take long trends. I hope with my exits to cut the losses and to preserve the wins. - The idea with trading zones is good for manually trading. I tried to compare my exits with zones exits, and haven't found that this is better. The problem is also that we have not fix values for stop losses. Remains to clear this in further versions. - An other problem is how the trends and the rankings are calculated. You are right to notice that in the last version the signals comes faster as in H1Scalper. I mean they are also better because I use weighted trend values from the three TFs, and not only the W1. Is possible that I change this algorithm in the future, but for the begin is OK.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Ok. I will continue to monitor both and see which is more effective. Thank you and have a wonderful weekend.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks Irathi. I downloaded 3 templates that make reference to the dashboard version 2.3, 2.4, 2.5. WHen you say version 4.1 are you talking of the EA version? I have found the thread regarding the history data and I will give a go. Thanks a lot and good job.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
At weekends the EAs don't works, and here is the indicator version. You can test the TFs parameters and the broker pairs. .

--- 帖子 #310 ---
There seems to be a gap in documentation in regards to the difficulty of installing the later versions of the dashboard. As the dashboard has progressed in its development teething problems have been addressed and I agree not clear to all levels of traders. Original versions of the dashboard were programmed as an indicator NOT as an Expert Advisor(EA). Indicators are installed in the indicator folder while the EA version of the dashboard is placed in the Experts folder. The reason for this basic change was the massive CPU the indicator was using. This problem is overcome by programming the EA version of the dashboard. The EA version does not show up when the market is closed which is on Weekends. The Indicator version does allow data. For the solution of your problem. There are a number of ways to address this: 1. Copy/Paste HiScalper System EA version 4.1 dashboard and /or Basket trader EAv3.1 into Experts Folder. 2. Install H1 Scalper OscD1_v4 into indicator folder. 3 Install v2.5 template into template folder. Close and restart platform. Use the v2.5 template .....Remove the indicator dashboard.....Install dashboard (whichever version) from the Expert Advisor menu in the platform. There should be a smiley face on the top right of the chart. If not...go to tools... options....Expert Advisors....tick Allow live trading.... I have just seen that Swingman has uploaded the indicator verion of basket trader 3.1... This is placed in the indicator folder. RE-Place as indicator (from custom indicator menu within platform)within the v2.5 template. The other way: Open up a chart. Right click on chart... go to properties at the end of menu. Go to colours. Place Black on all options except FOREGROUND.(white) THIS WILL BLACKOUT THE CHART... PLACE either verion of dashboard as INDICATOR (custom indicator menu from platform) or dashboard as EA from ExpertAdvisor Menu from within the platform. Hope this helps! I feel this POST will help traders not fully competent to the use of the METATRADER Platform . I have in a PREVIOUS POST on the thread giving links to learn how to use the MT4 platform. Please refer to this post and hope you and other newbies will find it useful. Happy trading! Thanks for your questions, as this has shown where the gap on documentation lies from the prespective of a newcomer. I will document installation better in the next final UPDATE manual. Also, thanks to another experienced trader who has emailed me privately to indicate where the gap is in regards to installation of dashboard and indicator. I think the expectation is that traders with basic knowledge of MT4 and forex 101 level will be attracted to this strategy. It is difficult for complete beginers to use this dashboard straight away.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
@lRathi and @ayoneeyee Just a question: if you trade the H4,D1,W1 Timeframes, will you have the column with H1 arrows visible or not?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Swingman for me YES will have H1 arrows visible. It help with timing in the H4 period when signal comes in realtime. Also, when autotrading feature =true .... I would like to see the H1 arrow column and compare to manual trading. Thanks

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Aha, this is OK.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
The BasketTrader DB_EAv4.1 is in the first version ready to trade... I hope they are not too many bugs at this time, but I can fix bugs only with live prices. Please test the functionality, and wait on the next versions. .

--- 帖子 #315 ---
For me, H1 is not visible, I have H4,D1,W1 Timeframes in my timmeframe list with columnsignal=1.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Use the default inputs and columnsignal=2! .

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thanks Irathi for the excellent explanation and I have been able to install both version. As feedback on the new EA seems is not keeping a record of the win or loss: around 6am GMT advised to buy AUDNZD at 1.27255...the stop was hitten but no record of it. It looks good though...good trading!! Rob

--- 帖子 #318 ---
This is OK! (We haven't still a new 4.1 explanations file...) - We have the input parameter "MaxEntryRanking = 0". For -1 -&gt; the program trade automaticaly all pairs For 0 -&gt; the program trade automaticaly the first half of the ranked pairs For n -&gt; the program trade the first n ranked pairs Alerts are fired for all signals, but trading is only for MaxEntryRange pairs. AUDNZD is at the time in the second half of the ranked pairs.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
BasketTrader DB_EAv4.2 update. I fixed several bugs in the exit modul. Now we have more wins as losses... .

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Dear SwingMan, How can I contact you by email? Thanking you in advance dohemi

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Thank you swingman for another brilliant ea. I am going to buy a new powerful computer especially for your system. I have a request for you: Is it possible when using the basket ea to have the choice not to implement the stop loss for each currency but to have a global one for stoploss and take profit . Regards

--- 帖子 #322 ---
We don't know if the programed system with the ranked pairs profitable is. If we in 2-3 weeks can say that the program hasn't bugs and you win on a demo account the money for your new computer, then is no problem to set global exit conditions. I do not will that someone loss money with my automatic EA. I test and will use the Dashboard only on a demo account, for manual trading on my live account.

--- 帖子 #323 ---

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Dear Swingman, Thank you for your system. What is the latest version of the dashboard indicator? How about the EA? Can I use the EA instead so I can trade manually based on the EA (same as indicator shown but less CPU consumption?) Happy trading

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi Swingman, What is the setting if I want to trade M5/M1 signal using Harmonic theory? Trading TF = 5? Time Frame list = 1,5,30,240 ?? Please advise. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Please spend time re-reading all manuals if needed on this thread. You will find your answers there.( this question and your next one in the following post) . Swingman has made the dashboard as user friendly and still such questions. He is a very talented and busy person and still found time to contribute this brilliant dashboard FREE to the community. I have spent alot of time doctumenting to make this information readily available to the community. I am willing to continue with future updates but would be directing newcomers to use the resources already provided rather than having to repeat such information individually, The expectation is for traders to spend more time to find these and read /re-read to find such answers Thank you for your consideration.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I tried the basket ea with different time frames but the results were not as good as the manual one. The stop loss was hit most of the time and the locked profit was very little. Anybody having better results

--- 帖子 #328 ---
This IS a tool for manual trading, and I will not develope an automatic EA, because the responsibility for your losses would be too large for me. The current automatic trading modul displays only a "which would if be" trading strategy and unfortunately this modul has at the time still many errors for exits. The problem is complex because I must administrate e.g. for the same pair signals for the manual and for the automatic trading. Please wait on the next version.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Gute Frage!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hello Swingman, In your decision weather to reaming a manual trading aid or to go to an EA, simply go with your heart. You have done an excellent and selfless job so far. Maybe someone else can take the idea and automate it. That is what a community is about after all, isn't it. Each one assisting in the way they can. God Speed Swingman, may the swing continue, long... in you favour.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Would it be possible to put a copy of all the current indicators and EA's along with the documentation into the first post of this thread and then to refer back to that? That way the current verions would always be in one place and it woudl be much clearer to newcomers (and to me). I have to reinstall mine due to a disk fail and things seem to have changed since i first installed it a few weeks ago. Thanks Swingman for putting the system together and to lrathi for your documentation.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I'll second that request, as I have just gotten a new PC and would like to start with a fresh install of the current indicators. Thanks, Swingman, from one old guy to another! (smile) Ed in Columbus, OH

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Yes I do this for the new 4.2 version, because they are also other indicators for the single charts. Maybe tomorrow. If you are in the Photo from your member profile, then you are a young fellow opposite me!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hello Swingman, Thanks, I'm using this setting now - 60,240,1440,10080 -columnsignal-2. Also, I'm still testing the BasketTrader ver4.1 automatic trading EA, though you already updated it to Ver4.2, I just want to observe it for 2 days at least in order to give my opinion. These are my observations; 1) Like you confirmed earlier, this EA gives signals faster than the H1Scalper. 2) I noticed it opened 2 trades - both wining trades, both closed them out on a profit of $2.40, this is on a Standard account with a 5 digit broker. The question are - how is the TS, SL and TP determined, also is this EA designed for a 5 digit broker or is there something a 5 Digit platform users need to do? 3) I noticed that the EA sends me Entry signal alerts for various currency pairs but does not open trade for all the alerts sent. For example - I got alerts to buy GBPJPY, GBPCHF and EURCHF (all profitable in manual trading), but the EA only opened trade for GBPJPY and GBPCHF. Is there a condition the EA monitors to open a trade or its just some bugs. Well, i'm going to wait for you to respond to these observations, at your convinience,then load the current version tonite. Also, I dont know if this is possible, if the EA can send an alert when a trade is closed. TIA. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
What does that mean?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
2) - The EA works with 4 and 5 digit brokers. My broker has on my live account 5 digits, and on the demo account 4 digits. Until now I haven't test with 5 digits, because the EA works only on demo accounts. - The trading modul must be interpreted as "benchmark" for manual trading. If you have better results as the EA, than are you good! I don't use TPs. About StopLosses. When I finished the system, I will try to explain the rules lRathi, lRathi will try to understand my english and will write the documentation. 3) - The system is something complicated to explain and to understand... In principle there are two systems those runs parallel. The one is the system for manual trading. The signals and alerts are fired and sended like in the old versions. The other is my benchmark trading system, which I must finished in the next time. This system don't send any alerts! This system trade automatic only the first half of pairs in the ranking column. Please tell me (also @lRathi) if for the manual system you will also have alerts only from the first pairs. 4) - For the manual system I can not send alerts for trade closing. This modul don't trade, make only recomandations. - For the benchmark system I can not sent alerts for trade closing. This modul trade alone with rules from me which lRathi will explain in the next time. The rules are very simple, without Fibo-Levels, Pivot-Levels, Fractals etc., like a manual trader use in his trading.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
OK. I got your explanation, at least that answered my questions perfectly. Thank you. Also, quick question, is it possible to disable the SL and TP option form the trading system, I just want to run 2 paltforms, one with default settings with TP and SL and another without TP and SL, just to see the outcome at the end of the week or so (all on a demo account). So far its trading good, though its too early to say, until its tested for few weeks. I'm gonig to run the ver4.2 in parallel also, to monitor the difference. TIA.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Also for me is not easy to understand and to explain what I programed... lRathi proposed me to split the EA in a system with only Signals and Alerts, and a system with Simulated Trading. In this case, the first system for example don't need the Win column. But, the second system must have also after an entry the intermediate signals from the first system, because you can add position in a trend and use the retracements. Just for this possibility I decided few days ago to have two systems in one...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
These are the trades opened so far by the BasketTrader EA V4.1. Not too bad though. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #340 ---
" Please tell me (also @lRathi) if for the manual system you will also have alerts only from the first pairs." If possible have TRUE or FALSE option. If not possible.... Alerts from all pairs as it has the rank in brackets when the alert comes(pop-Up and email). I assume the rank will be from the Combi trend. Just to comfirm... Manual alerts will have same Entry price as auto trading, but SL will be 21SMA HiLo with rank in brackets somewhere in the alert. Manual Profit target and MM will be up to individual trader.Correct? Arrow near entry price is different to look at in Basket trader v4.1 and v4.2. Correct? Thanks again Swingman.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Also this time your results are better than my! Please use the "correct" properties for the DashBoard window! .

--- 帖子 #342 ---
@lRathi - Surely come the rank number from the Combi Trend column. - The first displayed Entry and Exit Price comes from manual trading recomandations. But after a trade is taked automatic, the program must write the real Order Entry. Also every trader has manual different entrys to different brokers... If an Order is fired, the StopLoss remain unchanged until the program calculate a break even or other StopLoss values (see description...). - I don't calculate TPs.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you. Correction noted. Well the results are from the auto-trade function of the V4.1. Also, if you look at the SL column, you will notice that there is only 2 pips difference between the open price and the SL, I don't know if this is so with 4 digit broker platform though. Also from your previous question, I like the way the signal alerts are coming from all currency pairs for the manual trade, but, if possible you can add the same funtion you added to the auto-trade, where you select if you want signals from the first-half (by using 0) or all allerts (by choosing -1). I think that's a great function and i'm testing that on the V4.2. Swingman, you are doing a terrific job and I must tell you that I'm using the manual signal alerts now on my live trading account, the result is been good so far. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
First I would like to thank and compliment Swingman for the system, dashboard and EA, Excellent work! Thanks to IRathi also for the documentation. I am still using the Dashboard for the ASHE Daily System you created SM! I have an idea for the EA, make it responsible for the entry only, no TP or SL. Then we could use the trademanager ea, or similar, to take over the trade from there. Or let me know how to change the Trading_Parameters to achieve the same thing. Thanks, Mike.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
That is what I like to have, if it is possible Thanks and regards

--- 帖子 #346 ---
No, is not possible! - On the first view your desire is logical. - But on the second view... Please don't forget that we become from the DashBoard possible entry trend signals [1]. OK. The EA modul send an automatic Buy order and you will manage this order. OK. And now: - After 10 minutes the Combi Trend conditions on the DashBoard are changed, and the initial signal is deleted. - After other 10 minutes we become a new trend signal [1]. The EA modul send a new automatic Buy order for the same pair, because it gives none management of the first trade! What will you do in this case?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Ok, looks like that won't work. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Please test the new version 4.2 of the DashBoard, and in the pair charts replace the indicators. I think that in the trading modul there are still few errors... .

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Last night I used your updated automatic ea and the results were great, Equity is up by 12%.I wish it was on real account. Thank you SwingMan

I noticed at some time Eur/Gbp was in trouble and the dash board froze with an alert( error invalid stop loss) . the history showed multiple entries.Snapshot attached.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Yes, maybe because this version has few bugs in the exit rules. Wait on the correct version...

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Yes, the bug with frozens is fixed today. Sory. The multiple entrys are a bigger bug. I programed to avoid reentries after an exit in a trend, but it seems that don't function correct. Also for next versions please check this.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Cannot wait for the new version to try . Thanks

I see OVER FLOW ERROR when EA try to change SL: Alarm wind remains open until SL is placed...this takes so much resource of CPU....

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hey ayoneeyee, can you kindly refer me to the post where the manual signal alerts that you are using on your live account have been posted in this thread??? Many thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Yes, this is the error with which I straight fights now...

Performance continues to be excellent. 29% profit if I combine closed and open trades Started this new demo on Monday 8th June . Today 11th June. 4 days of trading.(17 trades). Entry from H1 charts. Trading H4 charts so... Exits using Fibonacci extentions H4 TF SL: HILO indicator H4 TF The profits would be greater if I took all trades. Entry signals many,many more opportunities. With 2x USDCAD trades, I see a H&amp;S on H4 TF and with Fib studies see fib clusters in three Exits, but only entered twice. Shall move SL manually and manage trades. Lots of pips. Great entries using the Dashboard. The combi trend column is fantastic to decide which currencies to trade when you are given such a choice of opportumities.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I can only agree. This is the best way to use the DashBoard. The EA can be only a benchmark to strike.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I can't get the combi Trend numbers to display, all zeros. Any ideas why?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
For such questions please post the DashBoard.

UPDATE BasketTrader v4.3 I tryed to fix the old errors, and I hope to have not inserted too many other errors... - A little problem: if you replace an old version with a new version, is possible that you become new orders in the EA, which would not have made from the old version... The same if you change properties. - A little remark about order closing: if a title which was traded in the first half of the ranked pairs, if it comes in the second half is automatically closed. .

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Remark: if in the Terminal window you activate the "Comment" column, you can see the rank position of the pairs at the order open time. If later when the pairs change the rank positions, is easy to see the differences. .

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I noticed the error messages on modifying the SL too. It's good some people already reported the problem. I hope this version will correct the bug. Also, from my observations, I found out the exit strategy is not really performing well, I had the EA on 2 charts, one contains just the DB and the other had the DB and TradeManager EA (for SL mangement). The chart with the SL management performed execellently than the other. Thus,I think the best way to use the DB for now is take the Entry signals from the DB , then manage the trade with some other tools you feel comfortable with, just like irathi is doing now. The DB gives excellent Entry signals, no doubt about that, I have really come to trust the signals I receive. Another observation, I noticed that the currency pairs in the top-half of the DB performed excellently than those below. I delibrately set the trade function to -1 on one of my DB just to confirm if the ranking actually have effect on the performance of the trading. I think the ranking feature is really a good function in determining low risk, high reward trades.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
The alerts are from the DB, I only enable the emailAlert feature of the DB, it's set to false by default. I hope this helps.

If it is of any help.... I do know the answer to why Combi Trend is showing 0.0 values. I do not seem to have this problem. However, looking at your image..... May I ask..... 1.Have you read through this thread? 2. Have you read any of the manuals? I maybe be incorrect in assuming you may need to spend some initial time re-reading all posts and manuals. I refer you to specially post #310 and #342 . Your dashboard image will start looking like all the rest of ours. Have you seen the inputs tabs of the dashboard and experimented with the various options?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Please re-read manual update dashboard v3.1. Understand what each input means. All INPUTS parameters are explained there.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
thanks,and this Baskettrader_DB_EA is not EA?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks thor. Now is easy to see that your broker has sufixes for the symbols, and I have forgoten to check this. One makes. Please use the "correct" window properties! (post #342, page 23)

--- 帖子 #372 ---
The performance figures using the trade management EA look great. I agree entry using the dashboard is one to trust. I am watching your performance with the trade management EA. I have noted the parameters you are using from your earlier post. In this post all trades are still open with good pips. Some thoughts though is some finer tuning to EA settings for different pairs as the daily range/volatity can differ quiet a bit between gbpjpy at one end and eurgbp at the other. I have used fibs for many years and trust it so much, it will take some demo trading for me to trust another system. I am watching your results closely . Thanks for this sharing too!

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Please read all manuals and posts again you will find your answers.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I have not any explanation for the zero values in your DB...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
What's wrong with this?

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Sory, but the suffix is not the cause for the zero values!? For the next version 4.4 I changed only the spaces between columns for 5 digits brokers. .

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I don't know, and I try to find the error source. But, because MT4 has not a debugger, is not easy to find the bug.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I will explain this in the documentation, maybe in the next days. But this is not important. For Long Initial StopLoss - Low Min from the last two bars or - Entry minus ATR*Factor_initialStopLoss The Initial StopLoss is a "soft" SL, this means that only if the close of the bar cross this SL we close the position. BreakEven - After an excurs of the price &gt; Entry + ATR*Fator_Breakeven, set 2 points above entry price as break even stop Trailing stop - After an excurs of the price &gt; Highs Avg Line + ATR*Factor_Hilo Trail, set the Highs Avg Line as StopLoss. - Priority has the direction change off Hull(8)

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Please install urgently the new version 5.1 ! - The name is shorter, to see better the version number in the attachments window. @chemfly signaled an error alert in post #376. - I found the cause for this error, and I was shaked that all the Hull average calculations and trends in the old versions was false! Now I hope that all is OK, and the new signals are better as the older. .

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi Swingman, I have the same error but I put the EA into EU H1 chart. Please advise. Have a nice weekend Happy trading

--- 帖子 #381 ---
first, this is a great system. vielen dank, swingman. the speed of my laptop is decreasing rapidly using the template. is there any way to get rid of this problem. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Not at this time. The problem is that the program starts every minute an extern Hull Avg calculation, you can see that in the experts page. TRy to change the refresh period to 5min. I tryed to integrate the Hull calculation in the current script, but was not OK. I will try again.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
M. SwingMan you have make a really good job !!! wow But a little question, why you don't allow to use BasketTrader with a real account ? so... i follow this thread with much interest.... krys

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Have you read my post #380? - The program has bugs, big bugs and very big bugs. This was one of the very, very, very, big, big bugs. It gives still further 3-4 bugs that I know and try to fixed. - In the first row of the first post on the first page I wrote: Here are the indicators for a manual system. The trading modul is only an auxiliary module. You find many systems and EAs in forum that are much better as my trading modul... OK, they are not integrated in a DashBoard, but this is possible and the autors can do this.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Ok Swing man... now i read the post #380.... Sorry sorry..... But so good work !!! to be continued !

--- 帖子 #386 ---
If I can be of some help to those who are having problems with your installation. Most of your problems have been caused by missing details in this thread and the invaluable documentation of lrathi. 1. The EA (currently Basket TradeDbEA v5.1) will not work on a live account. Mr. Swingman will not release a live version at this stage for obvious reasons. 2. The EA will not display figures when the market is inactive. 3. The initial installation is from Post #1. 4. Various updates have occured along the development process and some of the installation files have been superceded. Click on the box to the right of the page navigation box at the top of each page to check for updates. 5. Some of the initial files have become redundant but do not try to second guess which ones have. Always install the latest updates. 6. Understand that the original H1 scalper dashboard V2.5 template used a custom indicator which must be removed and replaced by the current Basket Trader EA. Post #310 refers. 7. There are 2 templates in the original files for viewing charts. Make sure you replace the original custom indicators in each template with any updated custom indicators. 8. Always read any updated documentation from lrathi. Hope this helps and will avoid too many unnecessary posts on this thread. Keep up the GREAT work Mr. Swingman !!!

Tuesday,Wednesday and thursdays are the busy days if we get the right signals. Made a few pips on EURGBP and GBPCHF today usng the dashboard. They have moved up the combi trend rank ladder to first and second place at present.(FXDD broker). EURUSD is moving south well, but no signal on H4 from Basket trader yet.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi guys, for all dashboard fans, here an alternativ tool: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...90#post2803890 A few members wrote me to give attention to the TrendMagic thread, and if you will use this system you have a similar program.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
can anyone point out why my trend numbers show out of whack? the EA is set to default. it shows up fine on my IBFX demo but, not here ( FXCM +Boston bridge). I started this demo up yesterday shortly after market open and it has stayed messed up the whole time. It has traded positively though so far. thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
You must have patience. After 2-4 minutes you receive normal values. I don't know why is so... Here also a broker with 5 digits. After starting I receive also big values, and after the third refresh remain stable. .

--- 帖子 #394 ---
i think i have seen that happen but, this client has been running since last night for at least 8-10 hours now since way before i went to bed. i will install a fresh version of the files into a fresh install of MT4 and see if it does the same thing with this broker.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
i reinstalled to a fresh mt4 and i seem to get the same thing with the combined trend though strangely a little better. the attached pic is after about 30 minutes of the new client install being open. here is the FXCM/Boston ecn client http://bostontechnologies.com/downlo...m_lc4setup.exe i know its a lot to ask but, if someone else would try it to confirm its not just me that would be great.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Yes, I have the same problem, The Combi trend figures range up to 5 digits plus the "." and the decimal value and when the value is negative, causes alignment problems. Also the trend strength figures at the bottom overlap. Removing the spread will make the figures more readable.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
I see. But my problem is that if I I don't have this "phenomenon" on my computer, is not easy to find a bug. I will change a little bit the calculation, maybe help.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
if you are interested in trying to swat the bug i suggest you download the fxcm client from the link i shared above and check it out. it only takes a few minutes to install a new client and drop the files in place. then you shall easily see it would think. thanks for even considering looking into it

--- 帖子 #400 ---
OK, the explanation is simple! Your broker has not enough historical data for some of the pairs, and the calculation of weekly trends is false... You must take lowerer time frames, or change the broker... I post a weekly chart, and the dashboard with daily as last time frame, and you can see thet the figures are ok. .

--- 帖子 #401 ---
ok that explains it. these servers are new i think. i guess they didn't load all of the histories. thanks i will ask broker why some missing. i will run it on another broker for now

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Yes. That fixed the problem. Thanks Mr Swingman.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Would it be possible to run the EA on a live account but with EA trading not available? Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
You have an option in the parameters for active EA, but I think I have programmed an automatic switch to not trade on live accounts - is dangerous at the time!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi I am trying to find out which timeframes combination work best. I noticed that 1 hour and below combinations give many signals but weak ones. The higher combinations give few signals but maybe more reliable ones. So who ever is trying the system what do you sugest? Regards

--- 帖子 #406 ---
It depends what kind of trader you are.... Intraday for swing trader? Some on this thread I hear are doing well on smaller TF(15 min ) while from my experience I am finding entry (H1 and H4) are extremely profitable. My Exits manually is this being finely tuned.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
SwingMan, can i ask u why dashboard write a .dat file into expertfiles directory?? it's blank???

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi Swing man, I took this free time that nothing is really happening to read through your MagicGirl dashboard thread. That's one great work you've done there. I'm going to download and follow that thread as well. One question though and this is only out of curiousity. Since you are the developer of both systems, which do you consider more effective trading tool, based on the indicators used to determine the condition for trade entries?. PS: One great thing this system, BasketTrader DB is doing for now, it's keeping me out of bad trades, unlike before, i will have been jumping in and out of bad trades. Now, all i do is keep my cool and wait for the signals... isn't that awesome. Thanks Swingman. TIA Ayo.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Do you mind sharing your timeframe combination and your exit strategy Thanks

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Very interesting question, but I don't know the answer! The best way is to start both dashboards with the same time frames, compare the signals and tell us the conclusions! (you or other members.) The Magic system was started as scalping system. The BasketTrader also, but you use it for longer time frames.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
@swingman Yes, i'm going to run both in parallel and report back to you. @harar - I mainly set my chart to; TFlist - 60,240,1440,10080. Chart TF - 240 Signalcolumn - 2 Well, for the exit, I personally use 2 indicators now - MA_cross Alert and BBand with email alert (i'm not recommending for anybody) - this is because I have my live accounts on a non-mt4 platform and i'm not always around to monitor my charts and I have been using it before I found this system. But, I'm trying to use a Trade manaagement EA on my demo account which is working well for now. The issue about exit is, you have to look for a system that is convinient with you and trust the system - just like irathi, he uses FIB, S&amp;R and other tools, for now there is no standard way to exit your trade with this DB-try different strategies, you will find your rhythm.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Tell me what the settings for this screen (for BasketTrader v5.1) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Well, my first observation of the two DBs (BasketTrade and MagicGirl), both running on a Demo account from the same broker; I got a faked-out buy signal on GBPUSD from Basket Trade EA this morning around 3:09am EST, but nothing from MagicGirl DB.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
If you heve the same time frames: H1,H4,D1,W1 on both systems, surely you receive different signals because they have different indicators.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I gather you are looking at comparing the number and accuracy of entry signals from Magicgirl dashboard 2.2 and Baskrt Trader v5.1 for H4 TF for the signal . I am doing the same. To note: 1. Magicgirl v2.2 has an option to use the single TF HG0001 or the MTF HG 0001 indicator. 2. This version needs to have H4,D1,W1 to be added added manually if you want signals coming from H4 TF. So, I have three dashboards set up, a) Basket Trader v5.1 H1,H4,D1,W1 but signals coming from H4. ( I have noted a Basket Trader v5.2 in an image of Swingman later posts but not yet uploaded on the forum) b) Magicgirl v 2.2 with HG0001 indicator (Single TF indicator) c) Magicgirl v2.2 with HG 0001 indicator (MTF indicator) Even though there are different trend indicators used in Basket trader compared to MagicalGirl....and different signals are EXPECTED. The question at this stage is : Which strategy is giving more accurate signals for the timeframe one is trading? Also to be noted: The trend magic indicator comprises of CCI and ATR indicators. So far these settings are optimised for scalping TF not higher TFs. I personally know that CCI=10 and ATR=5 are better for higher TFs generally speaking. ATR(optimal) may differ for indivdual currency pairs. I am still reading through the long original Trend Magic Thread which was set up to scalp the EURGBP currency. There has been alot of anmendments added in terms of rules and indicators by other traders and still have a long way to make up by own opinion if the adaptation to higher TF trading is Ok with the scalping settings. My early observation of comparing the three above dashboards are as follows: Magicgirl v2.2 with MTF HG0001 gives more signals than Magicgirlv2.2 with SingleTF HG0001 indicator which gives more signals than Basket Trader v5.1 for the H4 signals. Put another way, Basket trader v5.1 is more conservative and I feel from early observations more accurate in Entry signals than Magicgirl for H4 signals. Having made this statement, I think Changing the Magic Trend settings of CCI and ATR for higher TF trading needs to be tested. I Think HG0001 is a combination of Trend Magic indicator and MACD+BB indicator. However only the ex version of the indicator is given. The TG Vorticity indicator is the same as Fisher Transform 3 indicator which MAYBE thesame as another indicator which repaints.(All very confusing for me at this stage. I need more time to sort it all in my mind). In summary: The scalping TF settings of indicators for Magicgirl maybe accurate for lower TFs. To compare for Higher TFs there is still more testing to be done.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Irathi, I think you have done a great analysis of the DBs. I was only testing the MTF version of the MagicGirl versus the BasketTrade DB, i think its proper to test the single TF version as well. If you consider the statement by TudorGirl from the Trend magic thread, she said the default settings for CCI and ATR are the best setting they have now(i think she tried different settings on this 2 indicators), she also reccommend that those settings are good for TFs from H1-Daily. So i think leaving it at the default setting and testing it for a period of time will really determine which of the DBs give accurate signals -it's too early to call for now. Next week is another week, but for now, I'm still going to be taking my live trades from BasketTrade DB until I can trust the other one. Also, one advantage i like about the MagicGirl DB is that it has those two indicators parameters external, which gives more room to test with different values,also, my assumption is that it might be easier to program exit strategy with MagicGirl than BasketTrader DB. Above all, these 2 DBs are doing great jobs keeping one out of bad trades, especially in a ranging week like this.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Yeah, I know, i'm just trying to check the effectiveness of both - you know, the success rate of each DBs.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
And I thought the success rate is dependent on you...

--- 帖子 #419 ---
From Monday I will be dropping the dashboard option c) Magicgirl v2.2 with HG 0001 indicator (MTF indicator) from my testing. Refer post #416 as it repaints. Option b) STF HG 0001indicator does not repaint and is in practical terms a combination of MACD and CCI only.Both these are good trend indicators all rolled into one indicator. The settings covers M5 to D1 TF. I have been reading the TrendMAgic Thread. (Still another 40+ pages to go) I found many answers I was looking for. I commend the main players of the wonderful work going on and the scientific approach to test each stage. From my prespective, there is enough interest to cater for scalpers and higher TF traders too with the same indicators. Since my initial interest in Magicgirl dashboard and Basket Trader Dashboard comparsion... both have the same structure basically thanks to Swingman.Thank you. There are two things which for me remain difficult . Firstly, the memory of signal bars from which the initial signal bars come from once the computer is turned off and put one. Eg. From the H4 signal TF generated....From the first [1]/ [1] signal to when that trend finishes on the trading TF. I do not know the answer? (This is a difficult one and some attempt from the H1 signals was made) Secondly, because of the lack of a unified EXIT manual strategy. From my years of trading I know that the ENTRY signal and EXIT signal are best from different strategies/use of indicator. As a suggestion to this exit strategy.... The use of BTr Osc or the smHull MAv indicator(LOWER THAN 27) may be a Possible solution. However, BTrOsc is lagging and get out too late. The Hull MA (12) is a good setting for H4 TF. (THIS IS MY FIRST CHOICE) Even the Vorticity written as an EXIT for Magic girl seems good but does repaint. The extra feature in all these indicators is a lack of email alert at CLOSE of candle when there is a change of colour.( Magic Girl is not doing so, as she is developing a non-lag version of indicators) The MAGICGIRL dashboard has the TM and Vorticity programmed as separate columns but both indicators repaint. These are used as exit indicators by the original creators of the stragegy. I have the SSL indicator aka as TFT or ###Gann_HiLo_Activator attached on this post. This has all the options for MTF bars and email alert at CLOSE of candle etc . However, it is lagging compared to Hull MA. So left with the no email alert at CLOSE of candle with some good exit indicators coupled with the memory issue of signal TF leaves the trader in LIMBO. Another possibilitity for the higher TF traders is a version of MTF Scalper dashboard without the retracements features to be made into the EA version and tested for the memory issue with HULL MA (12) with email alert at close of candle as the exit. Retracement features are more important sensitive and important in scalpers(Lower TF) than swing traders as entry. I feel with so many TFs to synchronise with retracements leads to more realtime fluctuations in signals. Another possibility MAYBE is to add an extra column of the BASKET TRADER dashboard with the HULL MA(12) added to show coupled with email alert on indicator. This to me will complete the entry and exit strategy for basket trader with all alerts and on the dashboard for manual trading. Email alerts at CLOSE of candle for BTr OSC will be a backup for ENTRY on first signal of synch trend with higher TF and email alert at close of candle on HULL MA as a backup for EXIT from that trend. Ofcourse always confirming by looking at the chart. I hope my suggestions will not offend anyone and will be seen from the trader's prespective for ease of trading. Any feedback on my suggestions are welcome. Also attached is a PDF cheat sheet. Very good information. Also attached is a charts with indicators mentioned above are shown. Please note that 1.the HG 0001 STF indicator is the same as MACD CCI indicator 2. Hull MA (12) and Vorticity change colour are very close. HULL does not repaint while Vorticity does. 3. SSL is more lagging than HG 0001 MTF indicator. 4. Trend Magic is incorparated into HG 0001 STF. I have agreed to write a manual for the MagicGirl dashboard to be posted there. Due to lack of my time... there is a slight delay.( I need 27h in my day to cope with my responsibilities) I hope soon and anticipate some interest from there too to compare both dashboards. Also, I have changed ISP this week.... Please send all emails to my old email address I am able to still receive them while I sort out my mail boxes with my new ISP.

Hi lrathi, Thank you for taking time and writing explanations for newbies to understand.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Great job Irathi. You've really done an extensive reading on the Magic Trend system, I'm still way behind- trying to absorb the concept of the great contributors on that thread, TudorGirl especially. There are two things which for me remain difficult . Firstly, the memory of signal bars from which the initial signal bars come from once the computer is turned off and put one. Eg. From the H4 signal TF generated....From the first [1]/ [1] signal to when that trend finishes on the trading TF. I do not know the answer? (This is a difficult one and some attempt from the H1 signals was made) Sincerely, i'm not having problem with the memory of signal bars from the first signals because I don't actually take a trade on the first signal bar. What I do is turn my computer on 12pm eastern time (ET) on Sunday, but i don't actually take any trade until the open of the European session starting from when the German market opens 2am ET, with that I have almost eliminated any erratic signals and at the same time allow the DB memory to be refreshed several times. I started this because I noticed I was getting into many false trades while the Asian market is just opening and recovering from the previous week's trade. I will suggest you allow sometime for the DB to refresh before taking any trade on it, until maybe there can be some other programming solution to that. Secondly, because of the lack of a unified EXIT manual strategy. From my years of trading I know that the ENTRY signal and EXIT signal are best from different strategies/use of indicator. I agree completely with you on this. With a standard exit strategy on this system, it will make the DB a complete system, even if the exit strategy is based on one or 2 indicators - i was also thinking in line with using the HULL indicator as my exit indicator, I'm currently testing the HMA alert (though it repaints) to see how it works. i will download and test the attached indicator. For, the MagicGirl, i have the STF version only running now along with my BasketTrader DB - since i read on the thread that the MTF version repaints, i don't want to spend time testing it. All in all, Thanks irathi for your observations and thanks to Swingman for these 2 great systems.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Attached is a chart showing that MG indicators are turning out to be the same as other indicators which do not repaint. There is mention that a series of non_lag versions are being written, but will these be the same sensitivity of OUR GOOD HULL MA?? Basket trader is using the NON_lagging HULL passing through the well tried SMA21 to give signals. The MAIN FULL BTrOsc first signal will always be on the change of colour of HULL 27. So once the first signal comes on convergence of higher TF... Then just wait for HULL 8-12 to send an email alert to EXIT the already entered trade. The first signal on the trading TF(H4 for our style of trading) is not necessarily the first change of BtrOSc. Then with the memory issue, the numbers return to the first[1] signal several times. So looking at the dashboard for re-entry or not, is not applicable anymore. THus the email alerts as I suggested. Both dashboard are trending market MTF strategies. MACD is lagging which is part of HG-0001 indicator. The best bet at this stage is to compare both Dashboards for when they give a signals for the same currency PAIR. Some pairs are confirming at the same time while others will follow. Exits I think HULL 8 to 12 depending on TF is the best NON-Lagging EXIT. HULL 8-12 changes colour close to Vorticity/solarwind. So my early suggestion of email alerts at close of candle on indicators will help the trader to confirm signals from dashboard for ENTRY and EXIT. The long term goal is to help the trader stay away from the PC and trade from anywhere Either Basket trader or MG are working on the same philosophy for swingtraders. No doubt scalpers will be glued to the PC more. I am not a fan of EA's. So the EA developed by whoever will not be what I will use for swingtrading. The markets change all the time. These two dashboards are for trending market conditions NOT ranging markets. The EA does not have the discretion of the human mind . It is only a tool to help trading(IMHO).

Sorry, Got it was jumping ahead of myself. One only has to change the TradingTF and nothing else. Just keeping the post so that if others have similar doubts can check it out Hi lrathi, I was going through the PDF explanation If i choose 15M Time Frame for Basket Trader V5.1 Other than Changing TradingTF_5_15_30_60_240 = 240 (Default) To 15 =================================== Do I have to change any other settings? I was confused by the TimeframeList: 60,240,1440,10080, Do i have to add 5,15,30 to the list or keep it as it for 15M also. TrendTFs_234_1234 : 234 &gt;&gt;&gt;Shall i keep it as it is. Column_SignalEvaluation_MTF=1, here it shows by default 2 not 1 as explained in the pdf file ?? and in the dashboard it shows M5, (M15), H1,H4. Thank you

The reason for my investment of my time and effort in writing this detailed manual for the trader to read and re-read the manual and work independantly. We all like to help the community but not when information is already provided. I might sound horrible but the expectation is that newcomers are welcome but considerate too. With the generosity of people like Swingman and TudorGirl as both excellent programmers and many experienced Traders the Forex community is blessed to have the two talented groups(Programmers and traders) working together for the higher interest of the community. TG is not a trader but her talent lies in programming, Swingman is very humble, but is a very good scalper not longer TF trader as well as a genius programmer. I have mentioned before and repeat, there are two pre-requesite to use these systems/dashboards which are very simlar. (Both MTF Trending strategies). 1. Forex 101 level or higher 2. A good working knowledge of the MT4 platform. Please equip yourself with these to help yourself and others on the forum. This POST is directed for all newcomers to the forum. YOU ARE WELCOME but READ and RE-READ manual for answers. THANKS

I agree, I got my doubts cleared by re-reading the PDF and watching the dashboards for hours. Thanks again

Is the Hull Moving average used as one of the indicators for the DB the same as the HMA_Alerts indicator? because I know the HMA_Alert repaints, i have not really paid much attention to the Hull MA used for the DB, so I don't know if it repaints or not. If it's different, does anybody know of a non-repainting Hull MA with email alert, if you do, please help me and post it on the thread. i will like to use it as an alternative tool for my exit strategy. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yes the smHULL Moavg (27) is used as one of the main indicators in this strategy. smHULL Moavg (8) is used in the retracements. (See chart attached).Also re-read manual in the beginning it gives all the settings of all indicators used. The version used in this strategy has a HULL_periodDivisor=1.5 which the other versions of HULL MA aka Slope Direction Indicator and Mega Trend indicator do not have included. There is a HMA_Alert indicator freely available on forums which has email alerts added. HOwever, during an open candle it will send several emails alerts every time the colour changes during the H4 candle. ARE YOU CALLING THIS REPAINTING.? The email alert has to be programmed like the SSL one I posted to come only at CLOSE of candle . This is what I have seen talking about in my previous posts. ENTER on smHULL(27)/BTrOsc and EXIT on smHULL (8). THUS my Suggestion of adding an email alert on CLOSE of candle on both these wonderful indicators in my recent posts. Can you see the benefits to our longer timeframe trading? 1.BTrOSC 2. smHull Mavg It is up to Swingman whether he wants to add the email alert at CLOSE of candle or even xxx mins before close of candle to these two indicators for this strategy. He may have some other reasons why he does not think so, but I see the advantages. If you study the BtrOsc closely , the full signal will reappear when the hull(8) in again in synch with HUll(27) again. When there is convergence of two/three higher TF with all these retracements, using the numbers on the dashboard after the first signal[1] is the difficulty. For me KISS principle says enter on one full signal HULL(27) and exit on another HULL(8) Then re-enter again on another full signal etc. However, with this fantASTIC MTF dashboard IT is showing some difficulties. In comprsion: Magic Girl has one main indicator for various TFs and 2x external columns for confirmation/exits indicators. (Unfortunately, both the externals indicators are know to re-paint). What is the answer NOW??? I do not know? Any suggestions? Swingman has a fantastic strategy but the finer tuning still remains in practical terms for the trader.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi I agree with Irathi . Having an alert on Hull 8 is a very good idea for early exit of the trade without having to be glued to the computer to watch the trend.But that will be only useful for high time frame combination(1h,4h,d,w) or else lots of in and out ( I think) Regards

--- 帖子 #429 ---
There is a HMA_Alert indicator freely available on forums which has email alerts added. HOwever, during an open candle it will send several emails alerts every time the colour changes during the H4 candle. ARE YOU CALLING THIS REPAINTING.? Yeah. it's because it repaints that's why it gives multiple signals. But if the Hull MA can be coded to give signal at the close of a candle, it will be fine. I guess, for the main time i'm just going to folllow the Hull MA for my exit, but instead of using Hull (8), im gonig to use Hull (10) on a daily chart, so i can still allow the Hull (8) perform it's function as a retracement tool. this is a function that will work well for people trading on a higher TF. I will begin testing the indicator now. one quick question though, is the SSL indicator a lagging indicator? i've not really pay attention to how it works on a chart.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Looking for a profitable interday or intraday EA Hey, Do you have a good profitable EA that you can give me please- Im new to Forex and I would love to have an profitable EA.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Two Points: 1. My understanding of REPAINTING indicator is that after CLOSE of the candle the back candles change colour/indicator. Like the vorticity repaints 2-3 candles back after CLOSE of current candle. In realtime when the price fluctuates and therefore the colour of HMA changes... it reacts to price change in realtime..... not repaints the closed back candles after it closes. 2. SSL is a trend following indicator used my many traders. However,when you ask is it lagging? It is lagging relative to HULL MA. Please place both indicators on a chart and see what they do. I originally placed the SSL indicator on this thread as a possible EXIT indicator for this wonderful strategy for others to consider in a search for a unified EXIT indicator for Basket Trader.(like vorticity) We need to keep it in that context, and other uses of HULL MA/SSL in our own strategies is moving away from Swingman's strategy and the context of this thread. I see this happens easily in other threads and newcomers/and other members get confused to the content of the original strategy. Please feel free to PM if you would like to discuss any variations of the use of HULL MA as I have a similar interest. Discussion of ideas to improve this Basket Trader Dashboard in any way whether it be for scalpers or longer term traders would be the aim for this thread. Any successful performance figures of any TF trader and the use of the dashboard will be encouraging.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
i was following Dashboard for 15M TimeFrame since yesterday and it seems to give pretty good signals.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
It is a great MTF dashboard using the non-lagging smHullMavg as one of the key indicators for all traders (Scalper to swingtraders) Since Swingman has also written a similar dashboard for Magic girl, It would be great to compare both in the TF you trade and receive some feedback too in the comparision study. Both similar strategies are in their development stages and both have traders testing and trying to finely tune each strategy.

Hello Swingman, I know you are a very busy man, and as the programmer of this great system, you probably know more about it than anyone else, but I have some suggestions which are based on my observation of the DB, especially the auto-trading function and manual exit strategy: Observation-1: Though I had some losses in my trades this week, overall, the DB still performs effectively, manually. But i noticed that most of my winning trades were lost by the DB auto-trade function - not because it did not enter the trade the same time as my manual trade or its not as effective, but I found out most of the trades were lost because the SL or Breakeven function takes you out of a trade prematuredly either during a retracement or the breakeven price is too close to the current price. Request-1: Is it possible to make the SL, TP,Trailing and Breakeven functions, conditional functions (like if True - they are active, False =not active), then maybe you can add a Fixed SL,TP and trailing stop options to the parameters - this will give one the option of setting a fixed pip for SL and TP. Observation-2: The functionality of this DB goes beyond trading forex, it's as good for other securities out there like Metals-Gold, silver, Indices etc. I currently started taking trades on Gold and Silver and i realized that not all securities react the same to a particular set signal values. While the current signals from the DB might be good for some securities, its at times too early or too late for others. Request-2: I don't know if it's possible for you to make the parameters for the indicators used for the DB external - like the smHullMAvg(27), smHullMAvg(8), BTROSC, just like you did for CCI on the MagicGirl DB. I will like to test different values for different securities, then setup multiple DBs for groups of securities that react the same way - diversification, ehn!. I just want to see how this works. Observation-3: there's been so much talk or request for standard exit strategy for this great DB, I'm going to make the request one more time. Ok, I was browsing through the forum yesterday and i started reading this thread on Supernova Trend catcher EA. I like the idea incorporated in the EA for trailing stops and i feel i should bring it to your notice. - There's the idea of using ATR for trailing your stop, which to me make sense since we already have a column for ATR per currency pair on the DB. -Also there's the idea of using PSAR for trailing stop. Request-3: For ATR as a stop, I don't know if its possible to incorporate the ATR column as trailing stop ATR. Here's what i mean; Exit signal (Trailing Stop ATR) is calculated based on; - ATR period, ATR percentage and the ATR TF. For example, 50% or 80% of 5 days ATR based on entry TF. (maybe others can add more to the idea if they like it) OR If you want you could add an alert to when the smHullMAvg(8) or (values between 8-12) retraced from the main trend or changed color from smHullMAvg. I know my requests are large, but your DB is doing something great for me in my trading career and I very much appreciate your effort. I want it to be your personal decision if you choose to honor my requests, I don't want to inconvinient you in anyway and if you decide to do this, I am very sorry for any inconviniences. Thank you for your great and selfless service to this community. TIA ayo.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
@ayoneeyee I printed out your observations and requests, because they are verry good! My first problem to realize this all is in fact the time, and the second problem is whether I have confidence in the outcome. I have programmed a separate EA, but the results were not as good as required. An other variant what I tested was with the slope of the Hull average. This is an indicator similar with the Vorticity or with the FisherTransform, but without repainting! The results are better, and maybe this is an other signal system. BUT, yesterday and today I traded succesefully live a variant from before yesterday of this idea...! (I believe that TudorGirl use a similar strategy on H1, with using of the Vorticity) Short explanation (H1 Timeframe): - after 0:00 we identify the first colour change from the HullSlope indicator. For the candle we draw in the middle (HL/2) a rectangle with the height = 1 ATR. - breakout trading of this rectangle. The rule is to trade only after the prices remains 15min outside of the rectangle, and the open is within the rectangle (to avoid gaps and long bars). With a SL and TP = 1ATR, I tested many pairs and the results are verry good. Is possible to add other rules, but my impression is that the use of the HullSlope gives secure signals. Good for this system (and a possible dashboard) is that we have a warning signal when the colour change, and an action signal when the breakout is confirmed. In the charts USDJPY, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, EURJPY are winners. EURUSD and USDCHF - I don't know, but EURUSD is after an second entry a winner. I traded today the USDCHF and USDJPY earlier as the signals in the charts, but because the HullSlope so good is, with wins. .

--- 帖子 #436 ---
If you will test the signals, here an indicator: .

--- 帖子 #437 ---
The signals from the H1 charts are looking good. Thank you SwingMan, you are the best. I'm going to test the signals this weekend on my simulator and when the market opens on sunday. Meanwhile, I hope you will still consider my requests. Thanks for your consideration. Ayo.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Yes, the signals are verry good, but the indicator isn't. I try to become the right signals and areas in real time, but it gives problems. But, if you check the historicaly signals you can see that the signals are reliable.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
HullSlope and TrendReverse signals looks very good. This could be the next big thing. wow. Will test it next week. Thank you SwingMan for giving us great indicators.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
In the "4H Box Breakout" thread I just posted an indicator to test the potential of the Box Breakouts. (I don't know how the indicator works with real prices.) The indicator take automatic the upper time frame: - lower or equal H1 -&gt; daily - equal H4 -&gt; weekly - equal D1 -&gt; monthly - In the middle of the start bar is drawn an area with the height = 1 ATR, and three lines with the distance 1 ATR. - Signal arrows are drawn only if the open is located between the high and low of the area, and the close crosses one of this lines. .

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Was testing the Hullslope indicator for all pairs and it seems 4H Time Frame also seems to do well but with lesser signals and greater accuracy to save spread pips while trading frequently on a ranging market in lower time frames.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
hi swingman, the trend reversal looks great!!!!! is there any way to have this coded for 5min. too many arrows for this time frame. thanks

--- 帖子 #443 ---
In the BoxBreakout version 2 is possible to give different parameters for the ATR factors (distances) of the lines. .

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi SwingMan, I was testing the hullSlope Indicator with signals since morning live and after one signal, there seems to be no more signals. I was waiting for the whole day with no signals and just shifted the timeframe back and forth and i got the signal. But not every time. The signals dont refresh, I also tested it on 1M for quick check and same results. Thanks

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Does exist an indicateur to signal the crossing of two or more hull averages? Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Use google to search. If one exists you will find it.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Is anyone else testing hullslope and trend reversals indicators ?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I had a brief look but not a full testing due to time. What are you finding?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Yeah. I'm testing them. I love the hullslope indicator, I which there could be an email alert with it. Also, another powerful indicator is the BoxBreakout (testing the V1) indicator, the only problem is, the indicator need some kind of signal to alert you when there is change in direction/reversal or when to get out of the trade - the trend reversal signal indicator was able to perform this function. I'm still going to test for some time more.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I was testing this indicator yesterday and I saw it has a lot of potential. One thing i'm not too clear about is, in your statement: The indicator take automatic the upper time frame: - lower or equal H1 -&gt; daily - equal H4 -&gt; weekly - equal D1 -&gt; monthly Does it mean the indicator checks the upper TF for signals - i mean if placed on a H4 TF, it confirms signals from Daily and weekly? right?.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi, Is the trend reverse signal working for you, i tested them on all timeframe and they dont seem to generate any signals live. HullSlope is very good indicator, but without a signal, missing even one bar is going to cost a lot of PIPS in real time. I had much success with HullSlope in 15 and 30M timeframe but with very strict Take profit of around 15 PIPS Thanks

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Trendreverse signal has an email alert box in properties, you could try that if it works..cos the live signals alert are not working thanks

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Thanks spiderforex, I'm using the email alert and its working.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
SwingMan, please disregard my last question, I got my answer to it. I took the time to read the 4H Box Breakout thread. That's one powerful system. The only way to know the efficacy of this indicator is to read that thread - this is one indicator that gives you very good signal if you set your variables well and the opportunity to re-enter. Initially, I thought one might need a trailing stop indicator in order to use this indicator, but after reading the thread, I felt it's not really necessary, as the breakout can run for the rest of the week as specified by Ace284. After manually back-testing the strategy without indicator and also with this indicator, I observed that the indicator can perform more, but needs some improvements; 1) Adding the buffer parameter as an external parameter just like the ATR - I realized 10 pips buffer will most likely trigger false signals, if you take a look at the chart you posted - for the week begining at June 7, a Sell signal was triggered, which resulted in a loss trade. Any value from 20+ will be better. 2) If an alert can be added to the TP points - like when the TP1 is hit, there is an alert, also for TP2 and TP3. This is necessary because when a false signal is triggered, most times, from my backtest, it touches the TP1 before reversing. This is a personal favor: With most US brokers enforcing the hedging rule, its going to be difficult for us to trade this kind of system, as I just opened a new account with IBFX. I don't know if its possible you can write an EA that will be able to set a hidden SELL Stop order and BUY stop order (prices wil be inputed manually or horizaontal lines placedd at both edge of the box), then the EA will place either of the trade in the direction of the triggered signal, with the TP settings attached with the trade. I know i saw something like this where two horizontal lines are placed above and below the high and low of a candle stick, and if price crosses any of the line, a trade is triggered and the other line is deleted.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
@ayoneeyee In the next period I will have very little time for forex programming. I have been working on a completely different program, and now I have to respect deadlines... The BoxBreakout system seems to me to be successful, and I want to write slowely an EA. - My broker don't accept on live accounts stop orders, and therefore I must send market orders (your hidden orders). Few observations and system ideas: - It is indifferent if you take the Hilo form the first bar, or the ATR. It is better to take the ATR, because you haven't problems with verry long or verry short bars. - Not the buffer above/below the breakout zone is important to avoid false signals. (You must read the ACD System from Mark Fisher to understand this.) The solution is to wait until the prices remains a fixed period above/below the Box. Fisher recomand 1/2 of the first bar period, e.g. for 4 hour bars, wait 2 hours. But I think that 1 hour is enough. - As an additional filter is good to use the HullSlope indicator. OK, this are not rules for set and forget, but for an EA is not a problem. - Take maximum two trades in the upper period (for H4 bars, two trades per week). - Entry with 4 lot units. On TP1, TP2, TP3 sell 1 lot, and the last lot at the end of the week or at a SL. Fo all lots: - After reaching TP1, set break even 2 points. - After reaching TP3, set SL on TP1 - After reaching TP4 (entry + 4*ATR), set SL on TP2, etc. like a trailing stop. (With this rules I calculated for GBPJPY in the last two months approximately 600 points per week.) - Ashe's rule to take profits on the 3-th level is for me to static.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Great concept for an EA, Swingman, I support this idea. One more observation - the email alert in 4H Box Breakout v2 is not working, I missed the breakout of GY,EJ,and AJ on the H1 chart for daily trading because I didn't get email alert from the indicator - that was one bloody breakout to the downside and it happened while i was sleeping - PLEEEAAAASEEEE!!!! can you fix this email alert and the other alert on this indicator. Thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Here the new version : BoxBreakout Signals_v3 with alerts. Please test the alerts, because at this time all my trades make big pips, and they aren't new signals...

Thanks SwingMan. You are a life-saver. I will test it tonight.

I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but the alerts (both email and visual) seems not to be working. Is there something I need to do, because alert works on my other indicators. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
hi SwingMan, appreciate your work. this seems interesting. could u explain a bit more of the above b/c I don't understand the "- lower or equal H1 -&gt; daily - equal H4 -&gt; weekly - equal D1 -&gt; monthly" part of what it is doing. though, this is what I think it is doing.. the first part it is determing the true range: The difference between the current bar high and the current bar low The difference between the current bar high and the previous bar close The difference between the current bar low and the previous bar close so then, atr is then calculated by taking an average of the true ranges over a set number of previous periods. is this correct? and may I ask what is the periods you use for atr? any chance if u can upload the .mq4 source file for this indicator? : -) in any case, thanks again. cheers, gfsr

Hello SwingMan, I just want to say Thanks for the 4hr Boxbreakout indicator, its fantastic.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hello Fellow Member. checked out the Lite Forex, the provide 500:1 leverage however they only offer standard accounts/charts. I am trying out IBFX, they offer the mini charts however I need to have another broker that offers these charts as aback-up. I need the flexibilty it offers, since Demo accounts are limited in the tradeable sizes and only when you go live is that flexibility given. Leverages up to 200:1 is fine and the minicharts are equally critcal, so any one knowing a broker that offers these, outside of IBFX, thanks for sharing same info.

Hi ! I have thought to a function that should improve the indicator: "H1 Scalper DashBoard." A function that should display the strongest currencies (more bought), and the weakest (more sold). I have inserted a link as example: http://www.forexfactory.com/t/121839...h-meter-1.html (CURRENCY METER V5) Is it possible to create or to improve an indicator of this type? Tank you Best regards

Excuse me, i forgot to mention, for SwingMan. Thank you

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Swingman, I was looking to train my 12-year-old grand child in forex trading and in my search for appropriate indicators, I found your indicators. After seeing your post and indicators I was quite interested in you as a programmer and trader. With my limited abilities, I was training him to look for small but sudden retracement at high/low point of the chart. He has to wait for Semfor 3 to hit high/low in and then watch second bar in 1 minute chart and if the second bar go lower, see Stochastic arrow up/down and immediately press the trade button with 5 pips stop loss and 10 pips profit limit. He was enjoying this and also making profit but it was a long wait for for the semfor 3 to act. He got bored and I wanted to give him something more to keep him interested. That's why I searched the forum for indicators suitable for that age group. After finding those indicators I read through each of your posts and indicators and can make a picture of you as a programmer who has (a) exceptional abilities (b) works with precision and clear focus , (c) understands trading concepts very well and (d) works with a passion. Now I find this excellent analytical tool of breakout signals 3. If you have time please incorporate more switches in breakout signals 3 to increase the analysis span from daily to weekly, monthly, quarterly, six monthly and yearly it will be very helpful , particularly for a retail trader who wants to only make small profit with a conservative approach. I am attaching a chart and explanation. and this analysis tool will be for such a kind of trader or investor. If you can put a switch to point out maximum drawdown in pips on the ATR zones it will be further helpful. Why have you chosen ATR? Many people chose Average Daily Range (ADR). If you can kindly explain it will be good. Thank you again for this indicator as well as the indicators for school children. I wish you read Sniper trading workbook by George Angell and come out with stastical indicators it will be good. PJ

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Good Swingman, Ayonee, other participants here: would it be possible for somone who is utilizing this system, (developed or improved here) to display at the start of the each week , a report based on the past week's activities? This will be just a Graph from the detailed report in MT4 (Demo or live) to show how they have been using this method. This would be most beneficial I think and would most apreciate if this was done. Bless you all.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I'm sory @vasi, but in this period i have not the time for further developements or changes of indicator.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
- For ATR gives in MT4 the internal function iATR() and for me is easier to use it. They are not big differences between ATR and ADR values. If you will have "better" bar range values, then you can think to use the median of the bar ranges, or to use the middle value +- std. deviation etc. I know all possibilities... - I have an older book from G.Angell: "Winning in the futures market" who he describes the LSS method. I have also the original Taylor book. For such projects, to check the results of LSS I have not the time. I know that Angels published results for stocks are false, and I don't know if the three days cycles works in our forex market. On the web site of Linda Raschke you can also find an article about the Taylor method.

Hi Mr. SwingMan, I have see your trde system Basket, and is a good System, but he run only in demo mode. I want to use is in real and semi automatic mode, it is possible? Tanks

--- 帖子 #487 ---
PM me your email adress, but I do not recomand to use the system on live accounts, because it is not tested.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
I bought the book at amazon and I get it in the next days! In your charts you have some indicators - are they programed for LSS trading? If you open a thread for "LSS System for Forex" and you will use the system, then I can try to develop the necessary indicators and you can describe what I'm doing...

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Swingman, Thank you. Yes, I will open a thread for LSS system. The emphasis will be on manual trading and relying on statistical indicators developed by you. The focus will be on finding out what is happening in the market. And based on our statistics how can we estimate where the market will go: up, down or stall. We will not predict any levels. The idea is for the traders to get rid of fear and trade calmly and all the time focus on big picture. Not on indicators but on the intentions of the market makers and how to deal with them with our money management technique. Just like you I believe in sharing my real-life experience and knowledge acquired from experienced people and with no motive at all. You have already developed box breakout 3 indicator which we can use it for the system and improve upon it further. This weekend I will make the introduction. PJ

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Thank you, I think you did a very good idea. LSS has interested me earlier and it may be very useful for calm trading!

The ideas are maybe an extension of the BOS rhytmus in "The Reaction Trend System" from Welles Wilder (New Concepts...). https://www.lbrgroup.com/index.asp?page=ArticlesSwing2 Other links: see post #1955 http://forums.babypips.com/free-fore...ilder-196.html .

OK thanks. It's explained well. Now I am charged up.

Hi, SwingMan . I would like to check out your (promising) idea for your latest H1 Breakout strategy indicators. I know that you are very busy , so please excuse the following questions in my post .... I think you can answer very quickly (if not, no problem) : (1) Your screenshots show an ATR Indicator 'ArenDI ATR' set to 34. Is this indicator essential, or do you use it simply to determine TP and SL values (1 x ATR)? If I use another indicator for 1 x ATR TP and SL, is a period set to 34 OK? If not what value do you recommend? (2) I use the latest smHullSlope (v.5) and smHullMavg indicators - should they use default settings (period 27, etc.). If not what settings do you recommend? Best wishes, and thank you, in anticipation.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi DM (DeutscheMark...?), - For ATR I mean the 34 period is very good to smooth the ranges, and to react to volatility changes. - For the Hull average I take the period 27, because with this value you have a similar line with a more complex indicator who need more CPU resources (i_Sadukey_v1).

Excellent. Thank you for your fast reply.

Greetings Swingman, I have been reading this thread for 2 days straight now. I have also been testing version 5.1 of the BasketTrade EA all week. I am ECSTATIC about it. I have Live traded some of the auto trades generated by the EA from my demo and managed the exits manually with much success. I used the ATR of the pair at the time as my TP on every trade and it was hit EVERY time. I think the ATR is a consistent, steady method of exiting every position, IMHO. Thanks you for your contributions to this community and congratulations for creating an EA that actually can filter out many bad entries and provide good entries that have excellent risk/reward potential. Any system that is capable of achieving this in non trending markets is priceless. This week was pretty choppy and the EA managed to squeeze out more than 30 winning trades with minimal risk using the default settings. That does not include the other alerts given that also produced consecutive profitable trades for me. If it's possible, I would like to have the EA for trade in a Live account so I can run it on a small micro account I have. My demo results were very good using the default settings. BTW, a money management feature that can be built into the EA would definitely provide us with the opportunity to compound accounts quickly with so many quality low risk trades filtered out by the EA. I am eternally grateful to you and everyone who has contributed to the making of such a powerful trading tool. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Here is a version valid for live accounts. Please be careful! I post the version 5.1 and 5.2, but I forget which are the differences... Please test.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi SwingMan, I won't give up to remember you - although I know you have less time. I will stay patient and while waiting I will develop my trading-idea a little bit. Could it be possible to make this 4col version even MTF? I would really like it. Sorry to be a "Klotz am Bein" (I don't know in Engish ). Could you please PM me when it is ready and where I can find it? Indrek's thread is increasing very quick with the new MTF-idea. Thank you for your great help

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi Yass, perhaps you know already how it works. If not - 1. Choose an indicator and open an indicator-window 2. Choose a second indicator and click once with the left mouse button. Now the name of the indicator is marked. 3. Click with your right mouse button on the marked indicator and drag it into your indicator-window where you have your first indicator. That's all. Lycka till!

I know you are super busy, but could you or some nice coder here take your smhull slope v5 and just add a feature of putting on the right hand side of the indicator 1. the current bar slope reading 2. the previous closed bar slope reading. So I can quickly and easily see the slope of the last closed bar and the open bar working what the slope is? Please! OR if there were not enough buffers, you could create a tiny bar indicator that can go under it and tell the same info reading from the settings entered the last closed bar and current open bar slope. Thanks! Brian

hi Swingman, Can you please add a function to change colors of the box and numbers/words for the BoxBreakout Signal indicator? I tried to change the salmon color to dark grey , it didn't work, obviously I had something missing in changing of the code. If you can add the ability to change color, that would be greatly greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot. Garfield, you can find source code of v2, just see the attachments of this thread.

Hello Swingman, Irathi, and the rest of you, It has been about three weeks since the last post to this thread, so I guess the major discussions and refinements are now over. I spent the last couple of days reading the entire thread, and last night I loaded the dashboard, as a demo. I was delighted to see that it rapidly bought three pairs and with in an hour the account was up a hundred pips or so. I let it run all night and I see that I am now down 25 pips and two of the issues have stopped out. So, yes as always, the exits are the key. If it was real money, I probably would (should) have exited when I was 100 pips up. So now my trading friends across the globe, are any of you regularly using this tool? Are you successful? Have you blown out your account? Have you found a thread that gave you better results, causing you to move on? Please speak up and talk about the merits of this Basket Trade EA. I am amazed at the amount of time and effort that goes into developing an EA like this. I am a firm believer in teamwork, and Swingman and Irathi are great leaders in that. I have read through thousands of posts on many threads, looking for my best method, DIBS, Renko, Trader101, C4, etc. It seems like I try one, have a couple of failures, then look for something better, but the problem is inward. Enough of that introspection. The question remains, how is Swingman's Basket Dashboard proving itself in the Forex market? Best Regards, MurphyMan

Going to have to go with Murphyman on this...speak up Swingman! Madness

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I don't know... Is possible that the system is functioning, but I'm not a trader. Because I have read just today the posts in this thread, and you have not other answers, is possible that nobody use the system. On the other side, nobody (and I do not until few days) has noted the importance of the dashboard. In the dashboard we have the "CombiTrend" column. (Fore more explanations please read the .pdf file). If you ignore the signals and the system trades, you can see how a pair changes its position and moves from bottom to top, or vice versa. I have followed these movements only the last two weeks, and I believe that this can be very useful for trading. -------------------------------------------------- A possible simple BUT powerfull system, without indicators: - Positions above #20 - When a pair rises to the top three positions (from 23-&gt;20, or 18-&gt;15), go long if the CombiTrend is positive, or short if negative. - Track the trade in the H1 time frame. Exit: - If the pair falls two positions down If not: - Initial stop loss = 4 ATR(34) - Above 1 ATR from entry, set break even. - Above 2 ATR from entry, set trailing stop 2 ATR (or 3 ATR...). -------------------------------------------------- To time is my time for programming very limited. If someone takes this idea as interesting, follows the movements of the pairs, makes evaluations and post your comments. In the next dashboard version I will track the range changes. Please ignore the trading signals. Or, combine the signals with the range switch. The EA saves every 15 minutes the dashboard, and you can check historicaly the range changes. Save the posted "Basket_Files.zip" files in the "../experts/files" folder. .

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thank you SwingMan. To tell you the truth, I set this up on my machine, then have not looked at it until recently. I have been busy using your Ultra TRIX on the Renko charts. Thank you for that, also. I will keep your dashboard up and should try some demo trades and see what happens. I may not report back for a while. Thanks again. MurphyMan

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Just back to this thread to check it out again. I have a really good 15 min setup but this seems to me it could make that incredible. How can the dashboard/components be adjusted for 15 min trades? The 15 min is just as good as the 4 hr and better sized for most traders.. how can I adjust this setup or with your help do so Swingman so that we have H4 H1 and M15, taking trades on the 15 when it agrees with the H1 and H4, preferably actually entering when the M5 agrees... but that is optional. Brian

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Please read the .pdf documentation. Then change the inputs in the "TradingTF_5_15..." or " "TimeFrameList", and "TrendTFs_234_1234" and wait what happens. Because I'm working to the new idea and version, is better to ignore the signals. The idea is to trade only the pairs who advance 3 places, and not like in the old version the pairs on the first places. Perhaps we can better benefit from the dynamic of motions...

--- 帖子 #525 ---
SwingMan, I've read through some of your posts and you have done a great job here. I have a request to make. If you can make this Zerolag MACD print the divergence lines on the chart like this tradition MACD does. I'd appreciate it.

In case you are doubting the occurances.... Which equity/debt-instrument/commodity would you like and on which TF?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Swingman, So what you are saying is tracking a pairs position in the Combi Trend column on the dashboard could be a good signal.How do you access the zip files for 17 &amp; 18 November?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Swingman, Found files for 17 &amp; 18 Nov.To analyse data one really needs another indicator showing Combi Trend values, you could then visually compare the relative movements of the pairs.(Might get cluttered though with 28 pairs!) If i get time i might plot manually just to see movements.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
It's not necessary, and the dash board is not finished. Because I need live prices to find the buggs, is possible only from monday to friday to develop further the program. If possible, I post today a version to use in the next days. The only thing you have to follow is to check if after a movement of more than 3 ranges, an entry in trend direction is good or not. Here is one of the first trackings of range changes: .

Swingman, what metatrader broker are you using, because my dashboard on FXCM is missing a lot of ATR numbers, most of them just say 0???

--- 帖子 #539 ---
The broker is ActivTrades . If after several minutes the ATR remains zero or you have big trend values, you can try to restart the EA, the computer, or the car motor and eventually it will work...

Hi thanks for a very powerful and supportive DASHBOARD. However, I could not find and download the required indicators with it for a VISUAL. Can you please post the latest DASHBOARD AGAIN with ALL the INDICATORS as mentioned beloe? thanks mubashir =================================================== Version 5.1 Dash Board and indicators (2009.06.14) Files: BasketTrade DBEAv5.1, BasketTrade DBIndiv5.1 BTrOsc, BTrATR, BasketTrader HiloLines, smHull Mavg, smEmptyWindow

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hello Swingman, God bless you for your selfless contributions to FF. I lurked on this tread for a long time. Eventually I tested the Basket Trader 5.2 for several timeframes. My results completely mirror the observation above. While the entry signals are excellent, the auto ea frequently closes entries with small losses at retracements. It would be very helpful if you could add the feature to turn off the trade management feature of the ea, so those who want to use Trade Management eas to manage the trade can do so. The results will improve dramatically. I hope to go live with it if this option is added eventually as the entry is really good but I will not like the ea to manage the trade based on the results of my testing. Thanks

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I think you find all the indicators in the .zip files on the post #1.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
The dash boards has an input "EATrading_Activ" and you must only set it on "false". I hope to open in the next days a new thread with the new (and better...) dash board. In post#534 you have a first version. The idea with range changes is very interesting! Please to contribute with comments and analyses.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I post (without explanations...) the last versions of the dash board and few indicators. The TrioAvg is a moving average like the Trix (and a little better). - In the single charts, please refresh from time to time the MA and the signals. I need time to improve the bad programed refreshing... The MA is the only correct colored MA from all you know... - If the dash board does not draw the table, you must restart the EA, the Platform, the computer, or the engine of your car... - In the MTF Meter and Signal indicators you can switch between TrioAvg and Trix moving averages. I hope to open in the next days a new thread for this new indicators, and I'm waiting for comments and analysis. .

Thanks. Downloaded. Kindly add the "EATrading_Activ" to the Basket Switch. I only auto test. No manual testing for me. Also if possible give user choice to add TP and SL (to both BasketTrade ea and BasketSwitch ea) like you have in the Magic Girl SAR ea. Your master pieces will be much more robust if you give users more flexible options. Respectfully

hi Many thanks to swingman for his selfless wonderful contributions. Truely this forum is full of people who share their work and knowledge without expecting anything in return (e.g. swingman, cobra, scooby, steve, etc.). I was wondering if we have any data on the success rate of this system and performance (which pairs work the best and does it work better in ranging or trending conditions). Any feedback is most welcome. thanks

--- 帖子 #554 ---
The new BasketSwitch DBEA version 3.2, with a better layout... The indicators are drawn are very bad terrible, even if they are correct... One must often manually refreshes and I don't know whether I will find a solution in the near future. - You can save the dashboards e.g. every 15 minutes (in the ../files folder) and analyse later the signals and the range changes. The input options are "Save_Charts = true" and "SaveChart_Period = 15" - The alerts are not finished, please don't use this option. - The remark of @astral77: "which pairs work the best and does it work better in ranging or trending conditions", is not quite right. It gives not the question about certain pairs or ranging. My " Extended Currency-Indices-Ranking- And Switching " theory is a " Best Trending- Pair Selection " method, and is designed for manual trading. Is clearer now...? .

Hi SwingMan, Master of Swings, first of all thanks for your ongoing dedication to supply AND support breathtaking new tools to the community for free. Thank you, Sir! To avoid this "ol thread about ol`tool´of an ol`System" of getting cluttered with a much different system, please open a new thread! Especially as I thinkl that your new tool is NOT a SCALPERS tool. Please also include in your first posting: 1. Which Broker will it work on. 2. Which files must be included in an "fresh" broker install. 3. Sequence of installation steps. Kind regards Forex37

Great Swingmaster, is my understanding of the new index construct correct? After Bretton Woods everybody wondered how to find out the true value of the US$. So they designed the US$Index: The value of the dollar compared to 6 other currencies. This value is the US$index and can be traded. It shows if the USD is not only weakening against the EUro, but its weakinging or strenghting in general. Google wikipedia for US$index! If you extend the comparison beyond the 6 currencies of the US$index to ALL pairs the usd is part of, this would be the EXTENDED US$Index!!! If you construct a similar EXtended index for the GBP, this would be the EXTENDED GBP Index. So now you could compare the "general" streanght/weakness of the GBP to the USD - not just of one pair. Last step: Create such EXTENDED Currency Indices for each of the currencies. This would show you the currencies, the specific "inner" strenght of each - and how it compares to the others. Did I understand everything correct? Thanks Forex37

--- 帖子 #557 ---
SwingMaster, please apologize for this outburst of nonsense I`m publishing here: As I said, to my understanding your tool shows at a POINT in time a basket consisting of currencies with different (currency specific) relative strenghts which could be ranked according to this inner strenght. Now over time the specific strenght will change - one currency will get weaker against most others, another one will get stronger. The ranking position will change - just like horse racing. Anybody out there remembering "Ponyexpress"? SO I switch horses!! So - when and to which horse to switch --- how often in a race--- thats the special and mostly secret receipe on the track, the Holy-Grail-Algo. So your new system is a relative strenght/momentum-centric ranking and switching system? This would be nice (for me) as I trade such systems for equities (etfs) via cfds since many years with good success: between 2 and 4 % p month BEFORE gearing ( 20 % p.m. with 5xgearing) - 4 trades (1 decision) per MONTH!!!! So, anything I missunderstood?? Thanks Forex37

I have attached a snapshot of DBv3.2 Q1.Even though the two trend indicates are very similar....Trio Av and trix...and the indicators there is an option to switch to either one.... In the DB v3.2 which indicator is programmed to show the trends in the M5-M15-H1-H4 block and the H1-H4-D1-W1 block? Q2. Looking at the two blocks mentioned in Q1... H1 and H4 trend(UP or Down) are shown in both. However, looking at GBPCHF,GBPUSD, EURGBP,AUDJPY, AUSUSD and a few more.... the trend UP/Down is not the same. Q3. In the snapshot attached.... looking at the M5-M15_H1_H4 block ...both GBPJPY and USD JPY are all green.... the GBPJPY is rank 1 and USDJPY ranK 12.... BUT there is a yellow 4 on USDJPY and a dot for GBPJPY.... Which is the better trade to enter? Q4. Is it possible to programme an INPUT OPTION for trader to decide which MTF TF they want to watch/ For the MTF TRIX there are three strategies: a) 30-5, b) 60-15-5 ( Most popular) c) 240-60-15-5 Thanks Swingman

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I have 4x green diamonds against the aususd on the dbv3.2 with an UP arrow.M5-M15-H1-H4 On the chart..... looking at the trix meter.... H4 is still red. Again please clarify which indicator is used in the DBv3.2 for trend identification? Thanks

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Attached is the Dbv3.2 There are blue UP arrows against GBPUSD and AUDUSD . There are no such arrows for GBPJPY,GBPCHF,AUDJPY,NZDJPY,NZDUSD,EURJPY,USDJPY.(All these pairs also have 4x green diamonds) Q1. Are M5 to W1 linked to give the arrow? Or are the two blocks of TF's lower and higher independant to when signals show on the dashboard?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
@lrathi Thanks for your comments. I try today to fix some bugs in drawing the colours. Post #708 Q1. The DashBoard is programmed at the time only with the TrioAvg indicator. If you superpose both averages, you see that in 80-90% of cases the TrioAvg turn with 1-2 bars earlier as the Trix. Q3. The yellow (or green/red) colored figures after the Ranges column are “Range Changes”. Changes above 3 are yellow colored. Please read my first posting about this DashBoard. In the first column after the pair names, we must see a hand arrow only if the range change is above 3, and all arrow colors in the two blocks are identical. If the range change is not &gt;= 3, in this case we must see only a simple arrow. You are right that sometimes arrows are not drawn. I try to fix this, because this is a problem in the corresponding algorithm. Q4. Yes, we will have an option for time frames for the first block.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
@lrathi Please check the arrows in this versions. I fixed some bugs... .

GBPUSD and USD CAD

--- 帖子 #566 ---
@lrathi I don’t see any discrepancy !? GBPUSD In the first block we have red - red - red - green arrows in the Meter indicator and in the DashBoard. USDCAD In the first block we have green - green - red - red arrows in the Meter indicator and in the DashBoard.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
My comments in Blue below.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Just got up and checking the new posts. The discrepancy is between the the H1 and H4 of lower TF block and Higher TF block.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
OK guys, I see, well observed! But, the shifts and the signal interpretation in the two blocks are different... Input parameters: ShiftSignals_Block1 = 1 ShiftSignals_Block2 = 0 - The signal shift in block 1 is setted per default on 1 because the users of @gleaneagle's method use it, and maybe is good so for the lower time frames. The arrows indicates the local trend direction from bar to bar. - The signal shift in block 2 is setted per default on 0 . The arrows indicates the trend direction as momentum of more bars, combined with the location of the Close to the two HiLo averages (SMA 21 of High/Low). This momentum values are used to calculate the CombiTrend and the Range Changes. I am of the opinion that for the general currencies trend and for the range calculation on the upper Time Frames H1-W1, is better to have signals from the current and not from the shifted trend. - Please read Forex37's brillant interpretation of my " relative strenght/momentum-centric ranking and switching swing theory " as Ponyexpress (posts #556, #557)! He suddenly realized what is at stake... For tests at the weekend I attach the DashBoard as indicator. .

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hello SwingMan, I just came by to say big thanks and congratulations for a wonderful indicator - smMTFTrioAvg_Signals_v3. I hope you do not mind if I show one possible way to use it for trading MTF Trix. See attachment: my favourite filters BBStop and VoltyChannel are combined with TrioAvgSignals. (I attached the signals indicator twice - one for 5,30 and the other one for 5,15,60.) No blocks needed any more! Nice! Thank you, SwingMan, and I will stay in my own thread from now on Regards, Indrek

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Please don't do this! By random I have read today your last posts in your thread. Is good that such indicators as the TrioAvg are used, because that is my own development three weeks ago and no one except me knows how good he is... The BBStop is also one of my favourites, the VoltyChanel is unknown to me. I'm very interested to learn whether the dashboard is useful in trading. At times I can not trade and I need input from traders whether this nice range changes idea works in the practice. .

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Unfortunately, I am not a dashboard user, so I cannot help with that. But the idea of arrows showing MTF signals is very good. One remark: the settings of the size of the arrows cannot be fixed for some reason... I would like to have 5,15,60 arrows bigger and different colour than 5,30. But after I make the adjustments and switch between timeframes or reopen my MT4, the changes in size get annulled...

--- 帖子 #573 ---
- OK, but you can be one ... - I introduced few parameters in the new version for you. Please try if they works. iArrowUP = 233 iArrowDN = 234 iArrowHeight = 1 factor_SignalOffset = 0.6 .

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Perfect! It worked and I am happy now Thanks again! Here is how it looks now - big arrows for 5,15,60 and small ones for 5,30. When these match, we have a very solid signal.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi Indrek, do you find arrows a better visual representation than the first alignment after a long row of blocks? Not sure myself, i will test it. Hello Swingman, using the MTFTrioAvg, if i have 5,15,60 in the TimeFrameList, this should effectively give an arrow when all 3 blocks align for the first time since last change. Because that's not happening on my 5min EJ chart. Am i doing this correctly? thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi, SM and thanks for sharing your great job and time to FF comunity, i using your BreakoutBox Signal indicator for the last mont and i have very good results in 1H TF, i just want to know what other indicator or tool you use to filter de false breakouts? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I do not sit and watch my charts during a day. With alert+arrows I can switch quickly to MT4 when doing something else in the computer without any need to read the blocks. This is just an idea because I found the SwingMan's indicator couple of days ago and have not traded with it yet. Sorry to answer your question that was addressed to SwingMan but it seems to me that you have MTF Trix at the bottom of your chart. If so, then how could it match with Trio Signals? Trio and Trix are different. I compared Trio Signals and MTF Trio Meter and they match perfectly.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
You are right. The Signal- and Meter-indicator have an option to switch the TrioAvg/Trix averages. At the time please don't use this option in the Meter-indicator because I just found a bug and try to fix it.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
yes i see the trix option, so this should allow synch with block alignment? actually when i try to switch to trix, MT4 freezes

[quote=SwingMan;3284499]You are right. The Signal- and Meter-indicator have an option to switch the TrioAvg/Trix averages. Hi, SM and thanks for sharing your great job and time to FF comunity, i using your BreakoutBox Signal indicator for the last mont and i have very good results in 1H TF, i just want to know what other indicator or tool you use to filter de false breakouts? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I fixed the bug who freezed the chart for the Trix option. Please download the new version 4 for the Meter- and Signal indicator and try they with your input parameters. I attach also: - my indicator to draw the High/Low averages (period 21, shift 1). - the colored MovingAverages (TrioAvg and Trix). .

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Good work Swingman the Trix signals(arrows) seem to be working and MT4 is not freezing. btw, are trio and trix comparable? if yes, do you find one more useful than the other? thanks Peter

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Your answer is already answered in a previous post. See below for link. Q1 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=563

--- 帖子 #584 ---
thanks Larthi i thought this was the consensus; eyeballing 2 or 3 pairs i wasnt getting much difference, but shall take another look

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Here is a new version for the smTrioAvg_Signals_v5 indicator. In the previous version were the signal-alerts not activated. .

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi Swingman, many thanks for your time and help with these indicators - as ever, very much appreciated. A question if I may, hope it is not too lame!! When I put up your Trioavg meter on a 5min chart everything is perfect, but if i change the time frame to a 15 min chart the meter is no longer visible. Is it somehow possible to have the meter showing regardless of which time frame I change too? Many thanks and all the best. Nick

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Aloha Swingman, Very nice work again. I will use your trio as an impulse indication. For the trio indicator can you try adjusting your trix internals for to the following settings. momentum/emaperiod1=1(emaperiod2=8)(ema period3=5) Regards,

--- 帖子 #588 ---
My answer for the same question in the MTF-Trix thread: Sure can you get the Meter arrows in a M15 chart if you set manually the time frames e.g. on 15,60,240,1440. To set this automatically is also possible, but you have seen that as example @Indrek use two different settings with three and two time frames, and it has no sense to automate such a thing.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Maybe later, please remember me. Just a remark: for an emaperiod1=1 you get the close-to-close line, not an average.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Thank you and yes emaperiod1=1. I am looking for the zero-lag/latency effect. As long as it does not recalculate the results should be okay. Schweinefleisch=Schweinefleisch All depends on the chef.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
New version of the BasketSwitch DBEAv4.1 - The EA became an important improvement: at the start of the ExpertAdvisors the rankings for the last 4 hours will be calculated, so you start everytime with already present range changes. - The ATRs are calculated for the current time frame of the DashBoard chart. - The number and periods for the Signal-Block-1 can be changed. - Please don't activate the alert options, they are not finished. .

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Swingman, first thanks for the indicators you have made. If possible could you put and idenitifer on the alerts so it would be possible to tell which pair the alert came from and that the alert only sound once per bar.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Sure, but only in the next days.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I have the DBEA V4.1 on my chart now. I have set the first block to M60-M15-M5 TF ( most popular for @gleneagles traders) You are working very hard to improve options. Thank YOU! Q1. For the MTF TRIX traders (Gleneagles method). Is it possible to put an option to use Trio Av OR TRIX indicator into dashboard for signals? Q2. Put an option to turn on/off trend strength of single currencies? Q3. I understand the benefit of the change in RANGE of &gt;=3(yellow) is the better security to trade on the dashboard. HOWEVER, the Entry Range on my dashboard says"&lt;=9". a)This is because I have less pairs entered compared to your snapshot? b) IS IT CORRECT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND THEN, IF THE RANGE&gt;=3(Yellow), and &lt;=9 Entry Range on my dashboard says"&lt;=9". I trade that pair ? c) if range is above 9 Entry Range on my dashboard says"&lt;=9". .... Do not trade Eg Slv,DJ30,FT100? d) does the ranking come into the decision to trade or not? In the image attached eg. do I trade NZDJPY and AUDJPY as the RANGE is YELLOW 5 &amp; 3 even though the RANK is 12 &amp; 13? Thanks

--- 帖子 #596 ---
@lrathi Q1. Yes, in one of the next versions. But who make comparative studies? I think that from the single charts is easy to see that the TrioAvg is a little bit better as the Trix. The Trix is the ema of ema of ema. The TrioAvg is a linear combination of LWMAs, and therefore has a smaller lag. Q2. I post for you the version with activated options to show or not some informations. I have not tested if all are OK. Q3. Entry Range &lt;= XX is only my recomandation for the ranges in the first column. The figures in the last column are "Range Changes". The arrow signals in the first signal column you see as hand if Block1 and 2 have identical colors, and the RangeChange is yellow. (I explained this in an other post). If the RangeChange is &lt; 3 you see a simple arrow. Sure can you trade what you will: pairs without yellow RangeChanges, or pairs above the recomanded EntryRange. Who wants to ride lame horses is his problem... This is a decision in practice, and I'm not a practician. - Only one remark. The dashboard is designed to select the best trending pairs. I do not know whether it is right to mix currencies with indexes or mining. In this case the idea of RangeChanging is lost, and you have only a review table. For this case we want an option to disable the RangeChanges column and show the titles only in alphabetical sequence.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
G'day Swingman Thanks for your work on the new indys. Do the trix blocks still work off the same signal as swingman pv2 indy? If so there appears to be an error. I have set v4 meter to 1 for trix. This error shows on the 5 min TF but I have seen it on 1hr as well. Mind you I have seen similiar errors on the Roy 05 indy(but not on this ocassion) Cheers

--- 帖子 #598 ---
No, and you are right, they are little differences. The "correct" algorithm is in the Meter indicator and I have found this during the developement. The "bug" is in the old Trix indicators(!) and only after a horizontal line where avg[0] = avg[1]. Maybe latter make I a revision of all Trix indicators.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
OK --great. Thats been bothering me for some time.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi SwingMan, Unfortunately I was not able to test the TrioAvg Signals indicator because the alert function went crazy at the first signal that occurred. The alert was repeated every 0.001 seconds and could be stopped only by switching it totally off. There must be a bug. Besides, the alert message did not include the name of the pair that makes it useless even if working properly.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Thank you for all your amazing contributions, SwingMan! Would a combination of Hull MA's reduce lag even better than LWMA?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
swingman does this mean your version of the trix meter (using smMTFTrioAvg) is without bugs but the original MTF Trix meter has at least some inaccuracies?? thanks

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thanks Swingman, Your explanation helps me understand better every time. When all bugs are sorted out and explanations for each fantastic feature on the dashboard we will all thank you 1000's of times more than even now. I am still learning .

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Yes, I warned about it. I try to fix the bug, and it takes one to two day. The currencie name is now included.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
We are all learning. All the time. Swingman is truely wonderful gentleman. He is very calm and cool and we are all very grateful to him for his thread and contributions.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
No, because the Hull MA has a greater lag. You can test visual this on drawing the three averages on the same chart.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
What is "the original MTF Trix meter"...? If this is the Meter of other autors like I have seen in the MTFTrix threads, then the answer is yes. @Iamfx has very good observed and posted a chart with the differencies. The problem that I have fixed is following (two color averages): If you have e.g. a sequence of three bars and the average line is horizontal, you must go four bars back and identify the trend for this fourth bar. If as example the trend is positiv (color blue), then the horizontal sequence must be blue, and the trend remain positiv. This approach was not used in the old versions of the SuperTrix indicators and not even Tudor Girl has discovered this... For three color averages, a horizontal sequence has an other color as the basic green/red colors, but in the Meter indicators we use only two colors.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Do any of these "machines" really work?

--- 帖子 #609 ---
ok thanks, yes i meant the MTF Trix indicator attached to thread of same name.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I fixed few bugs in the previous version. Please download the new smTrioAvg_Signals_v6 version , and test whether they work properly. In the new Meter version 4, like in the Signal indicator is possible to set in the chart a shorter indicator name or none. - It seems to me that the BBTrend (@Indrek's idea) as a filter for the Meter signals is very good. Please test this. .

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Sure, here is one that I have in the final test phase: .

--- 帖子 #612 ---
You have to backtest it at least for 12 months and then try it on demo for another 12 months

--- 帖子 #613 ---
You're right I have to test it yet. We see that not all candles are vertically!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Yes, it seems too choppy

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi Swingman Good work and thanks for sharing. I like the dashboard (trend ranking). Putting that alongside any trading method I would think would be a great asset. Just look for possibilties on the pairs that line up with all the signals that have the highest trend value.....simple... Is V2.5 the latest version of that one please. Anyway thanks again Im looking at it right now mixing your templates and the dashboard with my normal trend following method...its beautiful. cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Pleeease, you or another member to first check my last posts. Perhaps you have seen that there are bugs in some indicators, then I fix them, then post new versions, and I know no more what was the last version. I think in post #596 is posted the BasketSwitch 4.1 version. If you have a 2.5 version, than you have not read every day carefully my posts. Sometimes I even write interesting matters...

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Thanks Didnt realise it had been made into a robot and changed its name, so in my eagerness to look at it , I missed some of the posts. cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Please download and test the new version BasketSwitch DBEAv4.2 with alerts for the main trend signals (trends in Block1 and Block2 match, and the RangeChange is greater than or equal to 3). .

--- 帖子 #619 ---
smTrioAvg_Signals_v6 version , and meter v4 are working well so far during EUR/London session. Alert are working well. I have set initially for trix and 60-15-5 strategy @gleneagles. Many traders will benefit from this Swingman. I found my trading this session much easier sofar.. THANKS .

--- 帖子 #620 ---
smTrioAvg_Signals_v6 version set to Trio and h4,h1,m15,m1 working well during London/NY overlap. Alerts working well. Great indicator, SwingMan!

--- 帖子 #621 ---
There appears to be a problem with the Arrow Signal. See the attached charts.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Indeed, both the meter and the signal are a work of art! Thanks Swingman for your generosity. Regards Pardy

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Sorry to say, but you haven't 1 minute time to read my post #607. Fur such questions is better to find self a proof whether the Signal-indicator or the Meter-indicator is wrong! I took me several hours to find an explanation and then doing the programming to. If you don't use my patented indicators Signal AND Meter, that is on your responsibility... You can draw the Trix average I have posted, and see what Meter is OK. Perhaps I do have a bug!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
First, both the signal &amp; meter indicators on the charts are yours. I was only pointing out that the signal (arrow) can &amp; did change positions after the candle has closed, with a time frame change. I never stated anything about the meter indicator. As for post #607, I have read it &amp; re-read it. I do not need to engineer a car, I only need to know how operate it &amp; when something is wrong with it. With that said, I’m not sure what you are trying to say. Either way, good luck to you &amp; your patented indicators. I'm done with the arrow.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
It's OK.

Hi Swingman and folks! Been reading this thread as a non-member yesterday. Joined up FF today to learn more about trading. Been trading forex for the last 5 months with damaging results So hope to improve my skills via this forum! Anyway, some queries. 1. Is the post #1 still the one which contains the latest set of files and documentation required for the BasketTrader system? 2. Have seen a few other systems being presented in this thread for eg: BoxBreakout and Trio. Are these completely separate systems (from Basket?) or are there any things which complement/needed/common to all these systems? Sorry.. slightly confused because there are a lot of files which I downloaded from the thread and not quite sure which ones are needed for what. I do remember seeing a post which mentioned that the post #1 contains the latest and the greatest set of files which are needed for the Basket system to work(?) 3. I do not lately see many posts referring to the Basket system. Irath are you there? (very impressed with the success you have acheived with the system, so just a bit curious to know how things are going with you currently?) Hope my queries do not sound too probing, as this is my first post and not quite sure about the "netiquettes" of this forum ! Regards

--- 帖子 #630 ---
You're right that this thread is confusing. The recent indicators have nothing to do with the first. I just wanted to open any new thread until the bugs are not resolved. But because nobody has interest to analyze the idea of Range Changes, the thread remain just a collection of indicators.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Sir, I love your indy's...but I cannot get any email alerts sent when a signal is given. I am refering to v6 of the Trio Avg and both the MTF TRix PV 4 Col and 2 Col indy's... I use email alerted indys daily and they all work fine...but for some reason I cannot get an email from yours.? Could you provide me the source code for v6? or the MTF Trix PV 4 Col? Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #632 ---
But because nobody has interest to analyze the idea of Range Changes, the thread remain just a collection of indicators.[/quote] Hello Mr Swingman, There is a lot more interest in this idea than you think. Everybody respects your create genius. I just think that there is a lot more interest in auto trading than manual trading. If you allow full ea auto testing there may be a lot more interest (IMHO).

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I believe you that many, as mentioned @Vanhook want to have a car without knowing where the motor is situated, and without to have a driving license. If no one can do analysis, and is only waiting for final results, then you have to wait a bit. Of course I'll post here in the next few days the EA with 20% profit per week...

Dear Swingman Despite what some people say, your hard work is much appreciated. There are numerous threads on this site and people are free to go elsewhere if they do not like it here. If some people go and read what the other popular threads such as THV, Scoobydoo, etc. say about you and your valuable contributions they would more cautious in typing such nonsense. I would like to remind you that this is your thread and you can BAN anyone you wish from posting here. Maybe you should exercise your right in order to avoid nonsense and irrelevant postings. We are here to be educated, however, some people look for a quick magic bullet solution rather than many hours of reading and more trial and error. Keep up the good work.

Ok, I guess my mail server was down...because I recieved @ 35 text messages this AM!! LOL. My wife almost kicked me out of the house for waking up the baby! Thanks for the help all!! One question: Once an alert/arrow is posted on the chart...it is not "for sure" until that candle closes correct? Other than that though, these signal do not repaint? Correct? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hello Swingman, I have an interest in range changes. I can even help with something interesting. Transcendental/ Non-Linear Momentum maybe?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Thanks @jacson. It is important to determine whether the range is helpful in your trading or not. The BasketSwitch EA is intended as tools for manual trading, and every other indicator can be helpful. As well as some member wish to make an EA, it would perhaps be too dangerous without manual practice.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hello Swingman, From my experience an index is weighed and constantly re-balanced. Not intra-day, but after close for example. If opening session momentum is positive, for example. Direction is known and automatic. All one would need is an early warning (impulse) detection that momentum has changed and has also confirmed a change. Very similar to front-running. A bank trading technique This would be fun. Happy Holiday's, thank you for the inspiration! I will report back...

Hi All credit goes to SwingMan. Simply amazing piece of work. The ROC thing is just too good and keeps u in with the running/trending pairs. Just a simple suggestion. Once the TREND in 4H has been identified by the system-FOR UPTREND--it should place the BUY STOP at the HIGH of -VE CANDLE RED CANDLE--FOR DOWNTREND--SELL STOP at the LOW of BLUE CANDLE. This will be a classic reversal and high probability confirmed trend resumption thing. I have been riding a trend with this method now for a good period of time and it has proved to be just as profitable as one can think of. The other request is that if you can kindly allow for a LIVE TRADING ACTIVITY with this 5.1 version with a reasonable 100 pips or less stop loss (or Anything based on ATR) Currently, When the entry is taken as the system recommends, some PAIRS start to correct themselves showing a -ve pip movement in the account. I understand that its a 4H chart based entry so wait and see is the best policy but we all like to see +ve pips rather than -ve ones. Hope to hear from you on this soon. thanks mubashir ;2798482] Please install urgently the new version 5.1 ! - The name is shorter, to see better the version number in the attachments window. @chemfly signaled an error alert in post #376. - I found the cause for this error, and I was shaked that all the Hull average calculations and trends in the old versions was false! Now I hope that all is OK, and the new signals are better as the older. .[/quote]

--- 帖子 #649 ---
From the post 520 to now, there are some explanations and versions of the last dashboards. It is not a system. It is only a tool which one needs to test whether it can be helpful for their own trading strategies.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Intresting thing... I'll try it in trading... It is good that the trend defined simulteneously with temporary rebounces... I'll try it.

SwingMan , can you please check out Andrews system and write a dashboard for it. PLEASE. Here's the link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=214635 Thank you.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Swingman, First of all, great job in developing the Dash board and other indicators . I read the thread over the weekends, and I find your system really amazing. I am going to try it out this trading week. I have a few questions regarding the Dash Boad EA BasketSwitch v.4.2. I don't understarnd what they mean especially the Combi Trend, Ranges, and RC. Also, the hand, arrow, flipping arrow and number signal. And the colored RC numbers. There is really no documentation to explain what they are. Plus, what is a good number for the ATR H1 to enter? And the Combi Trend, is based on which Time Frame? Also, what time do you usually do your trades (Asian, European or US markets)? Are you trading on 5M chart or Hourly chart? Thanks for all the information and system. Hope we can all make money this year.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
For such requests, I am willing to write a DashBoard, but so far I have hardly seen posts with the original system, except what Andrew has posted. If you use the system in practice, is better for me to see some of your trades to assess whether it is worthwhile to invest time...

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Beginning with the post 520 I gave some explanations. Unfortunately I am not a system developer and usually I develope tools only, no trading systems. If the tools are not used or only from few individual members, I did not take the time to write extended explanations... The Dashboard I recomand to use with/for the MTF-Trix Trading System.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I hope what I suggest will be helpful:My understanding...... Combi trend calculates the currency pair strength against each other using the higherTF's data(H1,H4,D1,W1) and averages this information. In forex the goal is to find in any given time the strongest currency and the weakest currency and trade that pair for the highest results.As forex we trade pairs not like stocks a single security...... the TOP GUNS look for this opportunity. What the combi trend does further also ranks the pairs in order from strongest to the weakest PAIRS. Further Swingman has incorporated the RC column which is rate of change from this ranking as it happens. The value of 3 and above showns which currency is changing strength fast. I use this great information tool to decide which pair to trade and use the MTF Trix for entry and exit strategy. Please google the subject and there is plenty of information out there. This is what I have done over the break and am even more thankful to Swingman to provide this to the forex community. I hope many traders will wake up to this tool and use it to their benefit. The dashboard is a visual presentation of all this at a glance. Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I think the only best indicator from the Dashboard is the Trend Strenght of Single Currencies. I am still new with this, so I need to investigate. So far that is the one that give me an idea which currencies to pick.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
The individual currencies strenght and spread on the pairs give me info on which currencies pairs I should be entering using the Trix Meter. But the Rank system is even better, especially Top 10 currencies, although so far I find it lagging, but it's still good. I still need to learn more... Keep you guys updated.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I agree the ranking is the added benefit as I know at a glance which pair to trade. Further the RC gives the information of which pair is moving &gt;3. It might appear lagging because it is average values of the higher 4xTF. MTF trix is the lower 4xTF. The MTF TRIX used for entry and exit based on direction of trend. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I still do not understand the negative number in the individual trend strenght of each currency. Should I ignore it and focus only on the positive number?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hi all, i'm following this thread from some weeks, so if i understand well a high RC number isn't a bad thing if we are in the first 10 positions, is that correct?

--- 帖子 #665 ---
My understanding: The more negative the number the weaker it is. Do not ignore. The ranking shows the stongest vs weakest currency. I am still confused about 2x negative numbers like eurgbp today..... It ranked first for sometime today???

--- 帖子 #666 ---
My observation: RC= &gt;3 is good. However, if too high shows an exhaustion of trend. I have to observe more????

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I find the RC numbers aren't accurate. So far the only thing that makes sense is the individual currency strenght. I only enter on the currency pairs I am familiar with. And of course using the Trix Meter strategy.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
- I think I have explained that the ranking in the CombinedTrend column is the sorting of absolute values. - Positive values shows a long CombinedTrend, and negative values shows a short CombinedTrend. - As axample, we have the currencies: aaa: individual strength = 40 bbb: individual strength = -50 ccc: individual strength = 30 The combined pair aaa/bbb has a CombinedTrend +40 - (-50) = 90 The combined pair aaa/ccc has a CombinedTrend +40 - (30) = 10 The combined pair bbb/ccc has a CombinedTrend -50 - (30) = -80 The ranking of the absolute values is: 1. aaa/bbb = 90 2. bbb/ccc =-80 3. aaa/ccc = 10 - The ranges changes, and the calculation is made every minute. If a pair change as example from range 8 to 6, than to 5 or 4 without falling back, this is good for the trend. If the range of a pair change from 8 to 10, 12, this is not good for the trend, and you must think to close positions in this pair. The RangeChange numbers (RC column) are accurate. You must only understand the logic of number changes... Because all single pairs of the default pairs are taken in the calculation, the ranges shows like a radiogram how moves the pairs each other in the comparative. This is the best way to set on winning horses, and to avoid lame ducks.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Another question, what's the finger/arrow pointing up or down next to the currency pairs mean? And also what do the number [1] 2 or turning arrow mean? Thanks for your explaination but I am trying to figure things out right now. First day trying out this amazing dashboard. Great Job

HI Swingman Thanks for all hard work. I was wondering if you had any indicators for MTF Overbought and Oversold in a range of currencies. I do not know if you are following Stevehopwood`s thread below. There is a regular contributor by name of SCOOBYDOO who is a professional trader and he has put forward a number of strategies based on OB/OS as alternative to Support/Resistance and steve has designed EAs for them. I would be grateful if you could point me to the right direction. Regards P.S. below is STeve`s thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=204646

- The dashboard is amazing, I know this! - But please believe me that I have not the time to explain a lot. Right now I'm working on two indicators, and read two books. When I was young I could do six matters at a time, now only four ... The answer to your finger/arrow question find you in my post #563. The numbers and the other arrows are similar with the description in lrathi's documentation (.pdf file) in the first post. Perhaps one of the interested user can summarize in a .doc file the postings with technical questions and answers and send me the file. I can revise them in a first step, and when lrathi have more time she can help further with a new documentation.

finger arrow when both blocks of TF's (lower block and higher block TF's) all show the same direction of PA. The other simple arrow when lower block TF are all showing the same direction but NOT with higher TF block. NUmber [1] 2 etc. please read the pdf manual from post 1 which I wrote. The meaning is all explained there. Thanks,

- I think your question does not fully understand, because from what I have read, the EA use the RSI. Sure can you use other indicators (Stochastic, MoneyFlow or ROC). But in the over 4000 postings I think there are some suggestions. - Maybe in the next time I develope few DeMark indicators who identify OB/OS zones, and maybe can help you this. - But until then I post for you(...) a nice indicator, to identify on which level the money is stagnant and then continues to move ! You can see that my indicator works verry well with all the other indicators or oscillators. .

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Thanks very much, you are always very kind and accomodating. For sake of clarity th EA is based on th following principals Go Long - if currency &gt; 200 4H SMA and OS in 15M, 1H and 4H. Go Short - if currency &lt; 200 4H SMA and OB in 15M, 1H and 4H. Thanks once again.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
This is OK, but the OS/OB are calculated with the RSI or not?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Yes of course they are. As stated average of 15m, 1H and 4H RSI`s are taken in order to indicate OS/OB (Which is then user defined i.e. 30/70, 20/80 or 10/90). thanks

"If a pair change as example from range 8 to 6, than to 5 or 4 without falling back, this is good for the trend. If the range of a pair change from 8 to 10, 12, this is not good for the trend, and you must think to close positions in this pair." what do you means by this sentence ?? i should saw the ranges column or the RC column ?? in the ranges column it shows 2/1 , 9/7 and the Rc column shows 3 .......

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Swingman,which time frame should i installed in?? because the EA shows different ranking in the different time frame . and what is the meaning in the column ranges number??

--- 帖子 #682 ---
swingman great indicator are they the latest version i have of have i missed v3 somewhere on the thread,keep up the good work, Is there another indicator i could use with the box breakout indi. Regards

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I hope this is the indicator you need. .

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Generaly I use H1, but the time frame of a chart is equal for an EA indicator.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Please think an analyse such indicators what they do... - In the range column 2/1 means the old range was 2, and the new is 1. This is a range change of 1 between 2 and 1. (The pair advanced at top). For changes above 3, without back movements grether as 2, the range change colour remain yellow. I think the rule is "three steps forward and two steps back" to show coloured changes in the RC column.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hi Swingman Thanks for the above signal i will put it to work right away,also may i ask do you have a signal in your signals toolbox that i could place on lets say a 15min chart that would tell me what the trend is in other timeframes. I,m using your breakout system and also andrews system and i,m making lots of green pips on both,so thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi Swingman With regards to the above post i have downloaded the scalper dashboard v3.3 along with the template v2.5 however the h4 trend is not available,when downloaded,is this the last version. Also is the full version of basket trader the zip file on page 1 still current. Regards

--- 帖子 #688 ---
HI Swingman Have you come across Schaff trend cycle indicator and if you have what do you think of it. In reviews in places such as investopedia it is rated quite highly and it is claimed that it is more accurate than MACD. I want to know what your opinion is. Attached below is MTF RSI indicator. I wonder if you have a dashboard version with multiple pairs. kind regards

--- 帖子 #689 ---
- I have not used the Schaff indicator, but I also know that he should be very good. - For the RSI I have no dashboard. But I think I have seen in forum in the last time a new EA with MTF RSI...

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Believe me, I can not remember what it was at that time...!

--- 帖子 #691 ---
thanks very much I will search for the EA you mentioned. regards

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I am an admirer of your work &amp; have an idea for a strategy using trix/trio - as I cannot PM you i wonder if you would send me your contact details so i can outline the strategy to you for your comments. thanks pipsta1

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi Swingman I put on the Dashboard BasketSwitch DBEA v.4.2 on Interbank and FXCM . Both give different output. Take a look and please give me advice on how I can fix the Dashboard differences. Thanks

--- 帖子 #694 ---
- Check first if you have on every platform all pairs (28) from the input window - In the first picture, for the pairs with large range numbers, gives not enough data! You must download with the menu ".../tools/HistoryCenter" m1 data. Please do this twice, then download the platform automaticaly data for upper time frames (for the weekly calculations as example). The problem is that in charts, the platform can download needed data from server, but indicators works with existing data. Is also good to restart the platform, sometimes help this when you see that not all pairs are in the table.

Have you guys tried USDBot? It's the newest EA Robot that is being sold for $149. I bought it and it doesn't work. Whatever they say on the website are lies...I regret buying it. I am trying to get my money back, but no response so far. Don't ever buy USDBot...My instict at first was right. Manual trading is still better. I was just curious and attracted to the money back guarantee... The trading strategy is really interesting but doesn't work. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/smilies/yim/sad.gif

Have you not been reading the posts in FF. All commercial EAs are scams. you can get good free EAs here in FF. try Stevehopwood`s Scooby BOJ thread for good robat. Anyhow you are lucky since you bought via CLICKBANK, they have a 60 day money back policy. contact them and get your money back. NEVER buy another EA, if its that good they do not need to sell it at $149 or even $1000.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
There is no need to buy any EAs nor systems nor indicators. Everything that is needed for successful trading is available for free in cyberspace.

USDBOT is stolen from FF. It is a free bot on FF renamed. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=210023

Hi Swingman and Followers, downloaded and implemented V.5 successfully. Does anybody have some statistics yet on the signals the dashboard generates? Where do I find more infos on the pairs-ratings from 1-28 ? This rating seems to be the most interesting/ important part of the board ... ... now I want to get into coding myself ... where is the best place to start learning ? Cheers Hannes

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hi Swingman Please forgive our intrusion. We need you help. At present we are using one of stevehopwood`s EAs and we are using his mptm to manage trades. Problem is the sleep function does not seem to be working and we were wondering if there was an EA which would do the sleep function. I would be most grateful if you could point us to the right direction. Furtheremore, which one of your TRIX (Triple Exponential Average) indicators is your favourite one. Kindest regards

Hello S/M. The indicator attached to post 506 repaints. Is there a later version which does not? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
SwingMan I found your indicator and really love it... Was woundering if you could make a change for it where I can change the color of the box??? If you could that would be great because this is an indicator I use everyday..... Thanks Derrick

--- 帖子 #705 ---
I post for you the source code of the "BoxBreakout Signals" indicator version 2, 3, 4 and 5. Now you can change the colours.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I hope that Steve can fix this sleep problem, I dont know what is the matter. I don't use repainting indicators in EAs, because the signals may be false after few bars. Manually (discretional) is possible to use with care such indicators...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Dear Swingman, Thank you for the system. Just finished the reading thread from the beginning. Hope to practice from today. Thank you! QP

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Your kindness is very much appreciated. You are the best!!!!! From what I am reading you are not using it as a indicator anymore???? If so is there some particulare reason?

I have not the time to trade...

Hi SwingMan I wanted to test your indicator TrendRevers Signals_v1.ex4 (Post#436) in M1 (alpari-uk) but when I put it on the chart then I can only see the boxes for a second and afterwards i can only see the arrows, and the arrows will not be updated anymore. What am I doing wrong? Can you help me please? Thanks in advance. Have a nice trade. Marvin P.S.:English is not my native language.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Keine Ahnung... Müsste testen I don't know... but can try in the next days to test live. Her the source code for some of the indicators, maybe help you. .

Thanks for the quick response. I'll check the v.2 on Monday. Have a nice weekend. Best regards. Marvin

Hi Swingman and Lrathi, Sure both of you are well and enjoying trading. What an amazing thread you guys have created.I wonder why it is inactive for so long! I read it all this weekend and familiarize myself with the basic principles and indicators. I am learning to use BasketSwitch DBEA V 4.2. Swingman here is request for a modification: As I need to see MTF trend of all individual currencies, so can you please 1. Modify it to display ONLY individual currencies instead of currency pairs in the 1st (Pairs) column? 2. If possible, please programme it to "MARK" the signal timeframe like the Basket trader.In this version shift number is displayed but no BRACKETS to mark/show the the time frame. I do not know whether you are still on the thread so I,ll send you this request via PM and email as well. Thanks in advance

He Swingman. Thanks for your expertise. Are you still trading these strategies, using BasketTrade DBEAv5.1 and BasketTrade DBIndiv5.1.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
No, I do not trade this now, it's also ten years old ... Maybe it's okay if you use it.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Thank you Sir. I am trying to find an indicator that analyzes all 28 pairs and suggest which pair to trade. Do you know of any that I could test?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Could the member in this group tell me if this DB tools is still in use? I can see that this tool perform some comparision and classify currency pairs from strong to weak using a result counter RC . But There are few small odd thing I dont understand and like to have clarification like the pairs group 1/2/3. It seem they are not just random i I switch list 1 and 2 (pls see result attached), or if I take some members out of list 1 or/and 2, put then these members in list 3, I expected the result should not change as the total amount of pairs has not changed, but the result of RC appears perpexly totally different are some experts still around or do you know Is there a manual available?
