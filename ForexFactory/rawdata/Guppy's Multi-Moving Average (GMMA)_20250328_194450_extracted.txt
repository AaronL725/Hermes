GMMA for VT. Screen Shot included. If you don't know what that is, don't ask me, ask google please.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Who's Guppy? That's a silly name. Google didn't help.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Google Daryl Guppy... Just one of the finest traders from Australia that has ever walked the Earth

Hi all, From my own, pencil chewing, observations it seems that when the shorter (blue) Guppy ma's are concentrated, either on the UP SPIKE of a BULLISH c/stick, or their ALL INSIDE the body of a similar c/stick. Then this seems to be a strong indication of a possible up trend. I use a 4hr chart, and on the USA/JAP, 800 - 1200 GMT c/stick,all the blue Guppies were in the top half of this stick. I went Long @114.96 Hi again, I closed trade (Demo Accnt) @ 20.33pm GMT @115.14. Only 18 pips - but for a late Friday afternoon trade i'm not complaining. The weekend starts now!!!!!!!!! P.s - many thanks Scott, i'll check out Amazon.

Hi, diminuendo, There is an excellent book by Daryl Guppy "Trend Trading" that explains his approach well... I would hold off trading his avgs until you have read this.. thanks much, Scott

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I found some stuff on the web explaining the thought process for the GMMA and it makes quite a bit of sense.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Finally, you guys have discovered Guppy... Guppy and Hulls Multiple Moving Averages work all the time; in all time frames... I am using a fine tuned version for several years... Do a search on Linuxtroll in Oanda and TSD for different screen shots... I also created a rainbow stuff based on this idea... Try this in M1 or M5 timeframe for scalping: EMA (weighted close): 25,30,35,40,45,50,55 (Yellow) EMA (weighted close): 89,99,109,119,129,139,149 (Green) Works well on other time frames too... http://img75.imageshack.us/img75/1909/guppy5ak.png Cheers,

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Actually, I knew about Guppy and Hull's Moving Average a long time ago.. I just was surprise that most didn't, and so I threw all the indicators up for people to download and use.. There's a guy on one of the forums, that has the prettiest Guppy MMA that I've ever seen. It's very very rainbow..

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Linuxtroll, How exactly do you use those MAs to trade? Like, do you only trade in the direction of the MAs, or do you trade when price bounces off the MAs? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
dolphin, I highly suggest you use google. There's about a bazillion articles on the Guppy indicator.. The articles go into great details on how to use it. try something like "GMMA Guppy" in any search engine, you'll get more than you can read..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Who is that guy... Can you provide a link... LoL

--- 帖子 #12 ---
When the Yellow MMA converges -- That is the point where all traders are agreeing on th price... Ideal place to enter -- You need a lot of screen time to identify the ideal entry points... When two groups separate - You have some good entries too... You can go counter trend using bubble area trading... Just trade my setup in M1 or M5 for a month and you will know the entry points clearly... Best tool for scalping as well as swing; and you do not need candles or price -- and use only one timeframe according to your money management (like woodies CCI system)... LoL Money management is the Key... Cheers,

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Linuxtroll, Thanks for your clarification. But what do you mean by "bubble area trading"? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hope this is the right bubble. Matsu

--- 帖子 #15 ---
When a rally ends; the yellow group always creates a bubble; where you can trade against the trend (take profit area) or it can be also a new trend developing area... Yellow is short term traders; Green is long term traders... for high probability trades -- always go with the green group... Cheers, --

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Here is the basics...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
please elaborate a bit more on this bubble formation....likw somw images, thanks

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Read the doc Matsu posted... images for all bubble examples are there...

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Matsu: Thanks for the great document; this is really going to help. I noticed that it began: "This is the last in the series of notes on GMMA applications..." And, from reading some of Guppy's work, I know he's got about 6 or 7 applications where he uses the MMAs. Do you have any other docs with the details on those? I've found bits and pieces on the web, but only a few are from the source. Many, many thanks to you and LinuxTroll - Ed

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Ed, I don't know which are in the series, but the attached files might be. Regards, Matsu

I have spoken with Daryl previously on his GMMA techniques, he was most interested to hear they were being used in the FX markets successfully (I will get around to that article one day Daryl). The most important thing to come out of my conversations with him in relation to GMMA were compression, expansion and distance between the short term and long term averages. This is explained to some degree in his Trend Trading book which I have read several times and recommend highly to others (although I may be biased to fellow Aussie authors ). In a nutshell, the very basics of it are quick expansion shows excitement, compression shows agreement on value and price which could signal a trend change and does show the lack of an underlying trend, while if the distance between the short and long term GMMA's remain relatively consistant, then you know the trend is well established and well supported, and can feel a little more confident in jumping on a trend late. Below is today's EUR chart as a demonstration: http://img50.imageshack.us/img50/3076/chart59zt.gif It is not of course the Holy Grail, you do get the same formations with two different outcomes, and it takes some interpretation so it is not something that can be programmed in a hard and fast way, but the method does give a nice easy visual way of determining trend status. Hope some of that helps.

This may be way off base to post in this thread. Delete as desired. A Wild Variation on a Popular Tropical Fish Theme Readers Digest Version in Bold @ Bottom. Recently I have been working a little with GMMA [Guppy] and found it quite interesting. {google Daryl Guppy for more info} But, as always, after taking it apart I had a difference of opinion in how it was actually being calculated. I wanted to plot it on a 30 min Chart and so that's where I started. This is a quote from one of the many sites that google turned up. {google chart finder for the rest of the quote} [quote] The inferred activity of traders is tracked by using a group of short term moving averages. The traders always lead the change in trend. Their buying pushes up prices in anticipation of a trend change. Their activity is shown by a 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 15 day group of exponentially calculated moving averages. The trend survives only if other buyers also come into the market. Strong trends are supported by long term investors. The investor takes more time to recognize the change in a trend but he always follows the lead set by traders. We track the investors' inferred activity by using a group of long term moving averages. This group is 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 day exponentially calculated moving averages. The GMMA is used in six trading situations [End Quote] Cool, but what does 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 or 15 bar EMA tell me on a 30 min chart? They equate to a 1 1/2 Hour, 2 1/2 Hour, 4 Hour , 5 Hour 6 Hour &amp; 7 1/2 Hour EMA's So I changed it to 4, 8, 12, 16 &amp; 24 Hours. The second set I treated with a similar progression. Then I added 6 more sets based in the same format. It looked pretty good but I realized I prefer Variable MA's to any of the others. So... I changed it again.This time I went with a Variable MA &amp; hung on a 4 bar EMA with an 8 bar ADX Period as the BASE MA. Then I took a 2, 4, 6, 8... up to 100 period EMA of that Original Var MA. WHY? No matter what timeframe you hang it on [ above 10 min &amp; below daily] , it will {I believe} be comparing relevent periods in time. I've identified what I think are 3 important MA's by making them thicker than the rest. This is what you get.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
The indicator.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Well it looks pretty, but does it effect the basic principals of the GMMA at all? I actually don't think the EMA periods are too important, as long as they are in the ballpark, do you interpret your indicator any different?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I was doing some reading and i'm interested in buying Daryl's book, but also was wondering if anyone has seen the DVD he sell's by the tittle of " Better Trading With The Guppy Multiple Moving Average "? The reason i ask is my trading-parter-wife is a visual learner and i was thinking this might be of great worth in understanding the GMMAs as a possible tool in our arsenal. Thanks for any comments. : ) Thom

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Yes, I have a copy of this DVD and it is very good. It is about an hour long and packed with concentrated info from Daryl himself. and lots of charts and examples.. I am hold the DVD in my hand right now... Thanks Scott Ps, I paid $14.95 on ebay for mine. brand new.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I also Googled Daryl Guppy and there was a shed of useful stuff. I would like to buy his latest book -- Trend Trading ----- Seven Step Approach to Success but I can't find it on Amazon or any major book site I know. I saw it on guppytraders.com but I was unsure about the purchase security for internet transactions . Any ideas where I can find this book ? Keven (Bramhall17)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I bought my copy through a book store that advertized it on ebay.. It actually worked out to be cheaper to get it to me from Australia. It is worth the effort.. Thanks scott

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Matsu: Absolutely great. Much appreciation for your quick posting - that's exactly what I needed/wanted. Best trading to you, Ed

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I just found the motherlode of Guppy materials: http://www.remisiers.org/guppyspeaks.html Perhaps you already knew about it, but I've got weeks of study ahead of me here... Enjoy, Ed

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Does anyone have this for MetaTrader?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Here you go.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
THX for the reply on my prior Q on materials...i'm going to order this week and dig into this facinating concept. While doing some google-links-research i happened upon this article . I am interested in knowing if those using the GMMAs for forex have found that FX (or particular currency pairs) are better suited to different emas, and one might come away with the idea after reading Hull's article linked above, that part of one's homework is finding the proper longest-ema-of-the-shorter-group and then add emas accordingly from that initial study. ?? : ) Thom a post script note...just won the ebay auction on the Guppy MMA. Yippie, will devour the info once it arrives. Also toying with the idea of ordering the Trend Trading book but will wait to view/study the video.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
As self-indulgent as it is to quote myself, I should let you know that what I thought was the motherlode, is not quite. Some of these are written by Daryl Guppy, but most I think are not. Still, good info here, but not much on GMMA. My bad... Ed

--- 帖子 #35 ---
You do not need a motherload... Just read and understand this... Cheers,

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Using 2 indicators - Overkill... We can simply use a template... Here is my fine tuned version... It is saved in weekly chart, but you can load it and save it in any time frame you like... Simple trading tip: -Check the weekly chart for the trend... -Enter and exit using daily chart... -Take it easy and you will capture lot of pips... To use as a default -- name the file to default.tpl Cheers,

Linux: This document is great - there's some nuance in there that really made things clear for me. In fact, I've already used some of what I learned in there to find three fine trades on daily charts that are already in profit (all in my demo account, of course). What's more telling about the usefulness of the GMMA is the fact that, from seeing your postings in different forums over the past 3 years, you've continued to use the MMAs and haven't abandoned them. That's a track record that most indicators would be jealous of - if, by chance, indicators had feelings, too. (My 34EMA thinks my ADX is a pompous a**, and my Bollinger Bands have self-esteem issues and bad credit) Thanks for the help! Ed

--- 帖子 #38 ---
If your 34EMA is doing all that.. Then open it up with the H-L-C and make it into "The Wave". That'll show tha ADX what it means to be an ahole.. ;-)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks Boiseboy... Yes, I am using it for years, because MMA works -- more you use more solid results... Let the two groups (Yellow and Green) feel each other... LoL Cheers,

Hi all, Eur/Usa, 4hr chart, 1200-1600 stick is a bullish (up stick) with all the Blue Guppies concentrated on the Upper Spike. Result - a 100+ point trade. I LOVE BLUE GUPPIES

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Heck I couldn't live without them Blue Guppies!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Me, too.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Looking at GMMA short in MT4 in the 1hr chart a buy (reversal) shows up in the 1 pm bar, and in the 4hr chart a buy is in the 9 am bar, much before the news announcement at 2:15 pm. The T3 also showed buys in these charts much earlier than the news. Is it psychic?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Pyschic fishes.. On this forum, now I've seen everything!! Seriously though, I do love the Guppies..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Follow the trend but beware of major news reversals

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Really? This is what my illegitimate son of a guppy [fantail] looked like. At least shortly thereafter. btw. you may notice i flipped at what I think will be a top based on another indicator. Right PipR?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
very interesting

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Guppy's multiple moving average numbers vs Alan Hulls: Guppy's numbers and Hull's number differ.. Guppy uses: 3,5,8,10,12,15 short, 30,35,40,45,50,60 long Hull uses: 3,5,7,9,11,13 short, 21,24,27,30,33,36 long So I've attached Hull's numbers here..

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hull also uses: 2,4,6,8,10,12 short; 19,22,25,28,31,34 long (better results); I have created a rainbow chart using ema 2-34... works well for me...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
i read some of the GMMA docs and im confused. you look for the short term MMAs to start to converge and cross the long term, but it can just as well bounce off the long term so how is this different than a regular crossover?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
here is the chart for EURUSD. can someone expand on what the GMMA is telling us?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
here is the pic and an exerpt from the article. look at decision point A and B. Both buy signals are created by the convergence of the MAs. A fails and B is good. Just like any other indicator, not perfect. However how is this different than a regular crossover technique, except for the fact that you are using a lot of MAs instead of two or three? He talks about ignoring a classic buy signal on March 10 in later articles using GMMA. Anyone have more info on this or the article?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi there clam61. When i viewed the DVD by Guppy on his GMMA model i came away with a much better understanding of the MMAs. ( Someone please correct me on this next statement if i preceived it wrongly ) Guppy does not use the GMMAs in a standard crossover model, rather he typicaly waits for all lines to cross and confirm the new trend and wait for a convergence of the lines and bounce away from the LTmas in the direction of the new trend for confirmation...such as what happened in late April on the chart you posted on CSL Daily as the blue STmas bounced off the LTmas confirming the new trend that began when all STmas crossed down through all LTmas in mid January. This aligns with how i've used them, and i would have seen the reaction of the STmas away, and down, from the LTmas at decision point A as another opportunity to go short in the direction of the new trend which began in late January. I would have also run the fibos out and seen if this area coincided with logical retracement areas and if it made sence that what i was seeing might be a stall/rest of price before resuming current trend. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Accrete, Thank you for sharing your views with us. If I understand it correctly, the way you described to use GMMA is a trend follower, and usually profitable for long term trend (because you usually have to wait for days if not weeks to confirm a new trend), right? A problem I have about the indicators/systems based on MAs is, I can't pinpoint when I should join the trend -- yes sometimes I jump in and can be right by luck, but that's just not good enough. When the market is ranging, all these indicators/systems seem to have a high probability to fail. And when the market is turning into trending, you usually have been burnt badly so you will always be waiting for some means of confirmation, and that sometimes will cost you a trend if it doesn't last long. So again, it seems still depending on luck -- how long the trend you just jumped in will last? I understand that these indicators/systems can tell us the direction of the trend pretty well in a trending market. But is there a way to find out when the trend begins and lasts? Or eveybody just jump in and pray it's going to last (sounds like gambling to me). Or there are some statistics shown that majority of the trends will last for days in this pair and in weeks in that pair so you guys just have the experience/feel to know when to trade. Just some confusions from a newbie, any lights shed on this will be very much appreciated! aha

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi again : ) In general my take on Guppy's model from what i've seen/read is that in a situation like the above CSL Daily from the later part of March through the first week in May when the ST in blue had gone up in to the LT red one would wait for a decision...either a clear bounce back down (as it eventualy did a couple weeks later) or break through and above as a change in trend. Once the two groups representing short term vs investors is all jumbled up this would raise a yellow caution flag that the market is range bound. And to switch over to some sort of range trading model such as a box-trade or classic breakout trade. ~Thom

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I came back to "edit" my above post but see that options is not and option at this point so here goes. Thought you might be interested in my set up on the GMMAs. This screen shot i took yesterday gives a good view of what is going on: Take care, Thom http://accrete.com/fx-posts/FiboGMMAsOnEurUsd.gif

--- 帖子 #58 ---
but simply put, how can oyu differentiate between A and B?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
If I understand this correctly it seems to me that both A and B are sell signals, not buy. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the general priciple is to trade in the direction of the longer term MMA group, but to wait for the shorter term MMA group to converge/bunch-up before entering. In this case, selling short at point A would have been profitable, but at point B it would probably be a small loss (depending on money management). Then in late April or early May as the shorter group peels away and separates from the longer group, this would be another short entry signal (which would have been profitable there). I think that the rules are roughly: 1. [Trend] Wait for the LT group to fan-out and start moving smothly up or down: This determined the trend and the direction we will trade. 2. [Early Signal] Once the LT group is fanned-out, wait for the ST group to bunch up. The ST group could squeeze in either away from the LT group (still separated)...or it might squeeze in near the LT group (maybe even touching the LT group). What to do next requires a final confirmation signal. 3. [Confirmation] (A) If the early signal (ST group squeezing in on itself) occurs away from the LT group, i.e. still separated from it, then we are looking for a confirmation signal that price will continue in the direction of the LT group. This signal could be the ST group starting to fan-out again...or maybe the signal could be by price itself, like a candlestick/bar moving in the direction of the LT group. If no such confirmation comes I suppose it's better not to trade; wait for another ST squeeze. (B) If the early signal (ST squeeze) occurs near or even touchin the LT group then we are looking for one of two confirmation signals. Either the ST group fans out again in the direction of the LT group (this would probably look like the ST group is bouncing off the LT group)...or we could be seeing the beginning of a new trend in the opposite direction, in which case we are looking for the ST group to cross over the LT group and then for both groups to start fanning out in the new direction. Can any experts confirm or correct these rules?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
In assessing the GMMA relationships in breakout trades four relationships are considered. The first two apply to the longer term group of averages, and the second group to the short-term group of averages. 1.Compression: Early in the breakout the long-tem group compresses. 2.Direction:Compression indicates agreement. The direction of the compression provides clues to the future development of the trend. 3.Collapse:It takes a lot of effort to break out of an existing trend. The rallies in a downtrend and the dips in an uptrend are short lived, and are expected to collapse or bounce. The nature of the collapse or bounce in the short-term group provides clues to the strength of the trader activity. 4.Rapid bounce or collapse:A fast bounce/collapse and recovery in the short-term group confirms increased trading activity. Also Guppy suggests to use a straight edge trend line to confirm the trend change. Thx DL

Just MA's (no different from GMMA's) that make it possible to spot and ride price waves. I just started practicing. It's getting easier by degrees. Here's a chart as of a minute or so ago. Happens all day long. Ebbing and flowing of price. All day long. FXS

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I entered on the green arrow (Red Bar) and closed at the yellow line. Locked in 25pips. The reason I closed the trade is that its friday and at the time 1.3500 was being blocked. Now that I am typing, I should have replaced my stop with a trailing stop.... PH

--- 帖子 #77 ---
What time frames do you fellas trade this on? its difficult for myself i can look at the 5 minute chart and trend is one way and then 15 and its going right back into the longer investor wave.. same for larger time frames, how do you fellas trade this?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I like the 15 and on spreads 3 or less. I am not a fan of the 5. From what I have seen it can be used on all timeframes. I just don't like all the MA's over the place. I am not a fan of noisy charts. That is why I only use it on the 15m. I have been thinking about opening an Oanda account to add to the pairs I look at with this method. I currently look at the usd.chf, eur.usd, usd.jpy and eur.jpy with this method.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I have an account with Oanda and I'm using GMMA's to trade the low spread pairs like AUDUSD,EURCHF,EURJPY,EURUSD,GBPUSD,USDCAD,USDCHF, and USDJPY. I trade on 1H time frame.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
excellent - In my opinion though using the hour time frames, you can trade ones with a higher spread because the hour time frames are usually used for longer term movements and not for scalping. But then again I am using the GMMA's for scalps and early entries. I don't rely on them for exits. PH

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I'm very interested in the guppy MMAs after reading lots of information on the concept. My question is, as someone asked a while back earlier in this thread, are the MA periods good for forex, or are there more optimized numbers which more accurately reflect the motion of most currency pairs on forex? Or for that matter, are GMMAs useful in the long term with fx?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi JoshDance, I use it as out of the box but, I have added a 200 (Thank you Lever70) and a 62ema. The reason for the 62 is that in every one of my back tests with different systems, this one it truly dynamic in all time frames. I personally only use it in 15 minute timeframe with only the majors + eur.jpy. I am in and out usually in less than 3 bars, but I will wait for the perfect set up and if a back it out and it looks good on higher time frames I will stay with the trade. I use the 15 to enhance my trading (entertainment value ) as a majority of my trades are based on the 4hr and entry on the 1hr. So I am not in a hurry and don't feel I need to trade this daily. It looks pretty, but to noisy for all my charts. PH Edit: Look at post 76 and my marked exit with the yellow line. I got out early. I would have earned another 50pips or so before a system exit. I was nervous about the rapid expansion and felt that it would come back down fast. My Error(s): Keyword "Felt" that equals an emotion Plus I discounted how good of a set up that really was. Both long term and short term averages agreed that 1.3440-50ish was a good buy. If you have New Market Wizards, read the Tom Basso interview p.278 his mentality for trading is a good example. Using self observation and trust in the system, you will collect more pips. The lessons learned after I closed and booked the trade are the errors I just stated. I know that I won't make the same error again. In fact, I stayed in a trade yesterday (eur.chf) when the short term was going against my longer term setups, but I took what I learned from the eur.usd trade here and applied it. PH

I use Fiboretracement along with GMMA which gives an idea where the TPs to be taken.

hey for all of you that use GMMA I am setting up a chat room on paltalk/ and tradingrooms so if interested we can learn the gmma better. I have been working with it, but still need some assistance. if any of you are in a room already id like to talk more about the guppy Jeremy

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I am using GMMA. A variation of it anyway. It, when followed and understood produces very good results. It takes awhile to get the "feel" for it, but it is rather predictive, sometimes uncanningly so.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
All, How about posting the charts of anticipating entries and discuss? Thx DL

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I'll post tonight when I get home from work. I just exited my gbp.usd position. I bought at I think the 8:30 GMT Bar @ 2.0173 and wanted to lock in some of the move and moved my stop up to 2.0240 wich was just hit. I really couldn't analyze the trade to well since I am not in front of my charts. PH

Yes 3/4 way up on first spike. I violated my own rule of not trading the news bar. I could have gotten in at a better price. Anyway, I just get back from lunch and see that market bounced for perfect re-entry/position adding. I was tempted to re-enter in my live account, but being that it's late in Afternoon in N.Y I was hoping it would flatten out for re-entry for UK open. I did re-enter on that bounce in my demo-account to test the late NY entry. the trade earlier was from my live account. currently demo account is +24.5 pips.

Waiting to go SHORT, if slow MMAs rolls-over and start spreading or if 3,5,8 of fast MMAs turns up and crosses each other then will go LONG.

I have marked my exit and entry. The yellow line at the bottom is my stop loss that I used. It came within 2 pips of stopping me out. Since I didn't have my charts at work and the rapid expansion of the move I placed my stop at 2.0440. Looking at this chart I need to close it only price closed below the short term. As you can see it didn't and continued to move. Sorry about the image. I forgot to click on landscape.

Hey Fxsigma, can you possibly post that indicator you are using which displays the market data on the right hand side of your chart. That looks a little more robust than the daily range calculator indicator I'm currently using. I've been utilizing Guppy for a while now, so I'm looking forward to checking out the trading chat room. What hours are the most active for the room. I actively trade the U.S. morning session, and look for swing or position trades off the daily charts in the evenings. Anjin

--- 帖子 #108 ---
As per Guppy: Pay attention, If the 3,5,8 crosses each other and the slow MMA starts compressing and the gap between both the MMA groups narrows, I would look for these conditions, if your entry is in 4H then in the 1H or if your entry is in 1H then in 15M for an exit. Thx DL

I've got the Guppy computer video CD that he published. It was very helpful in my understanding of different ways to interpret and use GMMAs (also, I'm using hull MA periods of 3,5,7,9,11,13 / 21,24,27,30,33,36). If anyone's interested, just PM me, as I've gotten what I need to learn from it. Mods, hopefully this is allowed for me to post this here. If it's not, please let me know! EDIT: hopefully no one infers from the above that I'm giving away the CD, or copying it and sending it to them--that would be against the law and quite disrespectful to Mr. Guppy, as it would in effect be stealing from him. The CD is for sale. I've gotten what I need from it, time to pass it on to another.

Wow, how do you see anything with all that? :-) On a slightly unrelated note, the "super signals" indicator as well as SHI you refer to are absolutely worthless in real time as they repaint (notice how all the arrows in the past appear at exactly the right times?). It's the equivalent of you asking what the weather was like yesterday--you'll always get an accurate answer! Might as well take your money to Vegas as use those worthless "indicators." As a general rule (there are always exceptions), if an indicator just prints an arrow, then you're wasting your time. If it were as simple as "click sell when you see the down arrow," then everyone would do it--if it sounds too good to be true, it is. :-) Very different from Guppy and MMAs in general--I like these because I understand the concept and how they are supposed to work--something very important for a trader, to understand why something works.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I trade the Guppy just fine on the 5 minute chart. I think some traders may get into trouble when the 5 minute goes sideways and try and force trades. I use it with the MACD and trade with the trend. If I counter trade the trend I am only looking for a few pips. If there is a divergence on the MACD or rounded bottom I will stay in the trade and may scale in. Scaling in is used only on a clear divergence of the MACD and not recommended until experience is acquired. I tried the Rainbow and thought it was the most beautiful chart I had ever seen, unfortunely I could not see the candles. For me the Guppy system gives me more indications and confirms the trend just as well as the rainbow. And I can see the candles as well.

Blue bands show the strength of the trend. The wider they are, the stronger the trend. The yellow line indicates the trend’s direction change, so when it bounces off the 32 level, trend goes bullish. When it bounces down from 68 level, the trend goes bearish. The green and red lines signal for entry and direction. If the green one intersects the red one from below go long. If the red one crosses the green line from below go short. Hope this helps.

Hi All, Don't know if anyone will read this as this thread died a few years ago. I came across a YouTube video of Daryl Guppy's seminar. Am sharing. Inserted Video I'm just starting to use GMMA. This thread was very interesting to read. Thanks to all who posted. Sharon

Hi, Sharon. Thanks for the video. Have to do some other things now, and will finish it later today. I've been using Guppy's along with TDI for several weeks. This is going to help a lot.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi Mary, Thanks for replying. Pretty neat we're both new at using GMMA. Strangely enough, I came upon an old note that I had written down the names of the threads here, so obviously at some point I was interested in finding out more but didn't follow through for some reason or another. Could have been the software I was using at the time. So I googled for info and came across this video which really interested me again. I haven't had much success at other templates I've made. One difference though between the long term ma numbers Daryl gives in this video is different than what he's mentioned in another article I read. He gives 35, 40, 45, 50, 55. But in the article he gives 30, 40, 45, 50, 60. I changed to the second set of numbers which I like better. What is TDI? I trade the Range 5 charts, but have up the Range 3,10,15 plus a thirty minute. I also use BB bands and a fast MACD as I'm simply used to them. I'll try posting my chart, but it might be too big.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sorry the video disappeared. Maybe I wasn't suppose to post videos. However, you can do a YouTube search: Taking Profits in Today's Market by Daryl Guppy, CEO Guppytraders. The first 18 minutes are about chart patterns so skip ahead if you already know those. I've made some changes to my charts as the fast MACD didn't work as expected so am just using regular settings, but added the CCI. Haven't done too hot this week as still getting used to the strategy and lack of discipline here. Posted my most recent chart. Also check out the great Thread GMMA Guppy 5m and 1m. Read and save the documents: GMMA Relationships.doc, The GMMA-Bubble Trading.doc, The GMMA-Trading The Breakout.doc. There are several Pdf files too. Lots of info there and worth the time to go through the thread. In one of the articles, Daryl Guppy states that the GMMAs aren't a stand-a-lone system, but is to be used with indicators of your choice. Hope folks check it out as Daryl's philosophy is solid. I use Range rather than minute as it's what I'm used to and my preference. Good luck and happy trading.

Just saw your posts, MAC712. Don't know why it didn't show up on my page. Checked thread because someone else's 'Like' showed up. LOL I found it interesting your using the RSI indicator since I've just began looking into that indicator myself. Don't know anyone who uses it so am watching some YouTube videos to gain some knowledge. I think there is a little more than buying from low and selling from high. I've changed my trading somewhat since I last posted. I basically follow PATs (Price Action Targets) with the 2000Tick and the Range 10 and of course using GMMA. :-) When I say 'basically follow', that means I don't take all the trades Mack teaches, only pullbacks and lower highs/lower lows trending or beginning of trend. Is your chart a Daily?

--- 帖子 #136 ---
------------------------- Yes I'm using RSI on my charts- A lot of people use RSI 14 and I look at RSI 12 as a momentum indicator as in 70 / 30 line being strength of the momentum and not over brought or over sold areas. The RSI 50 or even the 45 can even be support areas in a Bullish trend. Also on post 50 of the thread - Guppy uses: 3,5,8,10,12,15 short, 30,35,40,45,50,60 long Hull uses: 3,5,7,9,11,13 short, 21,24,27,30,33,36 long So I've attached Hull's numbers here.. Hull also uses: 2,4,6,8,10,12 short; 19,22,25,28,31,34 long (better results) I have filters using the Guppy and the short version of EMA 2 to EMA 34 using the cross of the two groups and the the expansion of the longer term groups. Here's a chart of AXDX using Hull's EMA 2 to EMA 34 short version. AXDX is very near to breakout point. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Has anyone thought about using instead of 12 EMAs 12 HULL or Zero Lag MAs? Could it make the Guppy indicator even better when using the HULL or Zero Lag MAs? Does anyone knows whether it exists an indicator with 12 Hull or Zero Lag MAs?

Averages GMMA has various settings including the ones you’re looking for. https://forex-station.com/viewtopic....14#p1295349814

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Hi All, I've been using various forms of an MA crossover strategy to trade pullbacks for a couple of years now, often successfully, not always. So when I saw the GMMA system it was very interesting because it's familiar to me (being a kind of MA crossover system) but it's much more than that too. The question always with MA crossover strategies, and also GMMA, is how to get in on a trend and how to avoid ranging or 'jumpy' markets. It's so easy when reviewing historical data, but not easy when doing it live. So with that challenge in mind I have been looking at ways of identifying trends using the GMMA and getting in on them safely. So far, this is where I am and I invite comment if anyone has other ways of doing this. 1. Use the standard GMMA EMAs (except in my case the fast ones are red and the slow ones are blue, because for all the time I've been using an MA crossover the faster ones are red (red = fire = energy = fast) and the slow ones have been green or blue (green/blue = cool = slow) 2. Add a 200 EMA to give overall trend - don't trade against this. (Thanks to lever70 for this - see Post #3 here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...g-averageigmma ). 3. (For a long trade) Wait for price to close above the 200 EMA AND for price to be mostly above fast EMAs, fast EMAs to be above slow EMAs, all of the slow EMAs to be above the slowest EMA (I have used a lighter blue colour for this so that it shows up clearly). Do not enter when only price has crossed above the 200 EMA - all 5 elements must be lined up (1. price above 200 EMA, 2. price above red, 3. red above blue, 4. all blue lines above the slowest (pale) blue line [edit: and also 5. the fast and slow EMAs have separated to show a clear gap between the two sets]. 4. Now look for a decent entry - the specific method you use is up to you. 5. Trail the stop up the 60 EMA (the light blue colour). I'm not saying this is the way to do it, it's just where I am at present. This example isn't even a "perfect" case - just what was on my screen when I needed an example.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Here's an EA that trails your stop up an MA. I have edited it so that it comes with my settings. I should have mentioned that when to exit is an issue for most traders. Using this trailing stop takes that away - just let it run and when you're out of the trade, you're out. But if it's a decent run, you will stay in for much longer than if you make a discretionary exit - we all are tempted to take a decent profit when we see it, but a mechanical system doesn't get excited when the dollars start flashing. It just keeps on going until the rules set for it close the trade. This approach means you might be stopped out early on those trades that don't go very far (this is a trend trading system after all), but when that nice trend comes along it's very lucrative.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Here's a real live example. The red line marks the first time all five conditions have been met, but it doesn't look like a dominant or powerful break. I'm hoping the current move is more decisive. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Here's another live trade using the GMMA strategy. When I noticed it today I saw we had a decent pullback and figured a trade was in order, even though it wasn't as soon after the signal point as I would like. I used a buy stop order. Hopefully it's got far enough to go to get me away from the danger zone and then I can just trail the stop until it's done. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I've been trying to figure out how to avoid entering a trade when price is going nowhere or price action is messy. What does price do before a long trend takes off? It's probably no surprise, but when there is a period of consolidation, when all the lines are close together seems to be the answer. Here are some examples. Please comment! The basic idea is if you could add together all the spaces between the lines, the smaller the total, the better. This is what it looks like. Right in the centre of that screenshot, everything is as close to everything else as it could possibly be. Attached Image And here is the full chart where that example came from. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So it seems it's a good idea to wait for price to go into a consolidation phase, when price is going sideways and then try to catch the explosive breakout. That seems to be how to get in on a high probability trade and avoid poor setups. In theory anyway! We all know how difficult it is when done live.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Here are some more examples of a period of sideways movement (in the first two it is mostly off-screen to the left because I wanted to show the size of the breakout trend!). Then there is the "pinch" when the lines are very tightly packed. After that comes the breakout. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) And here we have a long consolidation period - when will the breakout happen? So the next question I need to work on is how to catch the breakouts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #146 ---
So if I can be patient and simply wait for these elements, avoiding all others, I *should* make lots of high probability trades: 1. Sideways movement (easily shown by the tight lines of the GMMA plus 200 EMA); 2. A "pinch"; 3. A breakout. Next year. We need to stop trading now because nothing will be happening for a while. We can't sail our yacht when the wind isn't blowing. But I am excited to try this in the new year.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Like it, will check and come back with result.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
This trade did not use the "pinch" concept. It has been going back and forth for almost two days. The GMMA lines are still very much in my favour, so I'm sticking with it. But have a look at where a pinch did happen (very helpfully on the same chart as my current trade). All five conditions I mentioned previously were also met and once that had happened price dropped away fairly soon after. If you look closely at the sideways period before the pinch I don't think there was any time when a pinch was in place AND all five conditions for a trade were also in place. So in this case it was not difficult to identify the breakout. It would have been a great trade. A useful lesson. Wait for the A+ setups. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Greetings everyone, I wish you a great year of trading. It's not yet time to resume trading - probably Monday 10th is the day. In the meanwhile I have been looking at how the GMMA pinch works - the anatomy of it - and it really does seem to provide high probability trades. And if one adds in the five necessary conditions as listed on this image, it often protects us from entering when the breakout isn't ripe yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But it's always possible to find successful examples of almost any strategy, so I went looking for cases where the "perfect" anatomy exists [EDIT] and the trade would have failed . There are very few. On the idea of trailing the stop along the 60 EMA - this works only when the trade is trending well and the EMAs are fairly steep. If the trade isn't moving well then price will more easily touch or cross the 60 EMA. So use this with discretion. A volatility-linked stop like Guppy's Count-back line (CBL), or trailing it down the swing points of the lower time-frame might be better in this case. And at the beginning of a trade when one is living more in hope than with certainty, it's a challenge to know what to do with the stop - either move it to B/E as soon as possible (and probably get stopped out with no loss), or keep it well out of harm's way for a decent amount of time and only then start trailing it. Waiting for price to reach 2R seems like a good strategy. I'm certainly looking forward to getting to use this approach soon. Then this theorising might all come crashing down!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
i have been using this system for many years now with descent success. i dont trade currency. i trade nifty and bank nifty on hourly timeframe for swing trades. i trail my stoploss on ema 10 low for long trades and ema 10 high for short trades. i also use rsi 6 and 12 both should be above or below 50 for going long or short. always wait for candle to close for entry and exit. this way i am able to limit my losses to minimum and if the trend is good the profits are fairly good. also i ususlly trade 2 lots. my first target for one lot is equal to my initial stoploss. once my first target is acheived i move stoploss of second lot to entry price.

i dont use the short term MMAs. instead i use channelnel of 10 ema high/low. as long as all candles are outside the channel, the trend is very strong.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Very interesting, Rajesh, I had never thought of creating a channel by using the High and Low moving average options. In an earlier time I would be tempted to jump into this and use it, but changing systems when we find one isn't working for us is bad practice, a symptom of a poor trading mindset, so I won't! The truth is that trading success is inside our minds and the holy grail is between our ears. So any system will work if we have those right. I have been using an EMA crossover system for some time now and had some very successful times trading pullbacks to the EMAs with it. The GMMA approach is in the same territory, but is a richer visual guide to price behaviour, so I am keen to explore it more fully. There are two main GMMA options that I want to gain experience with. One is the "pinch" that I have been posting about recently and the other is trading pullbacks during an established trend. Both are well-supported by the GMMA system - all of that lies ahead, can't wait! Here's to an excellent 2022. A boring one for trading, hopefully. Anyone care to guess why that's important?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Aaah I have been reading throught the thread over the holidays and maybe interpreted it differently regarding the pinch points. I took it that the initial pinch expanding is the signal and a second pinch/expand is the confirmation of entry. I have popped it on a couple of your charts : Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have I been intepreting things incorrectly or is this just a slightly "safer" method?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Hi Snowdonred, the secondary pinch you identified is not my kind of pinch :-). I would call that a pullback to the MAs and it is a good place to enter a trade. My definition is based on calculating the total or aggregate value of the gaps between all of the EMAs including the 200 EMA AND current price, ideally. The lower the score, the tighter all those EMAs are to each other. I'm sure there's an app that can do that, but it's simple to eyeball it. After that we wait for the five conditions I listed to be fulfilled and then go for it. My research (noting that historical data is always much easier to trade) suggests that a setup consisting of a consolidation period where even the 200 EMA is horizontal and close to the other EMAs, followed by a pinch, followed by an expansion almost always leads to a strong breakout. Like this ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) You might identify other "pinches" in the sideways section prior to the breakout, but the five conditions I list mostly prevent an entry until the real breakout happens. Subsequent pullbacks (your secondary pinch) would be great places to add to the trade or re-enter after being stopped out.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Gotcha, I saw your earlier reference to adding the distance between the lines, I previously threw togetheran EA that tried to take signals from a similar idea but found it was getting a lot of false entry signals caused by a sudden spike/retrace in the price forcing the MA lines to contract, especially with the lower length MAs.

One more way i use GUPPY MMA is to create SIP of my own, create your own portfolio. i select only 3 stocks with good fundamentals ( debt free, divident paying company) and follow them on daily charts. the idea is to add small small quantities on every dip with exactly the same amount. to give an example i invested in HDFC BANK last year when the price was around 1000 rs. i bought worth 25000 rs on every dip. to identify entry is very simple. the long term moving averages should turn green and both rsi be sbove 50.( entries marked with white arrows) keep on adding till you hae a significant quantity. today hdfc bank is trading around 1500 rs. this way it is possible to crate significant wealth over a long period of time.

Here's an interesting chart - consolidation in place for a long period, EMAs tight, but 200 EMA still not part of the action. From the H4 chart I would assume that price will cross upwards and a bullish move will result, but the weekly is clearly bearish. However, there's something of a long-term support level holding price up, so a reversal is possible. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #167 ---
The trading year starts in earnest tomorrow. My focus will be on pinch trades and pullback trades. Pinch trades: I am watching a number of pairs (USDCAD, NZDCHF, NZDJPY, AUDUSD, AUDCHF and EURUSD). Some are still in the consolidation phase and the pinch is still to come (e.g. NZDCHF), while others (e.g AUDUSD) are already through the pinch phase, the required conditions seem to have been met so it's ready for a sell stop order. But on this one the breakout move was quite explosive so the pullback might continue upwards for a while longer. Also, on this one there was not much of a consolidation phase, so I'm not sure about it. Pullback trades: Once a decent trend is in place I will be looking out for pullbacks. EURJPY shows how this might work (easy in hindsight). Oscillators like Stochastics or CCI can help with this, but the best indicator is the eyes on the front of our heads and trusting the system that Daryl Guppy provided for us. I will enter using a stop order in case the pullback keeps heading away from the trend. I'm really looking forward to this! Good luck trading everyone. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's what my not-quite-perfect AUDUSD trade possibility looks like. None of the usual components of a good "pinch" trade setup are quite in place, or in the right place. Not much of a consolidation phase, the pinch isn't tight, price exploded down out of the pinch zone, leading to that big pullback. Nevertheless, there is a series of lower highs and lower lows, so the marked possible entry point *should* work. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Not so promising - closed manually with a small profit. This was never the ideal trade but at one stage it looked like it was ready to drop. It seems it's better to try to get in soon after a consolidation period has been breached and not later, as happened here, where there wasn't much consolidation in the first place. Once I saw a higher low develop I took that as a warning to get out but waited in hope ... Earlier chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) After closing Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I've been watching this pair for a while - long period of sideways consolidation. There has recently been a breakout shown by the GMMA so I waited for a pullback and entered at market. In all cases of long consolidation like this a S/R level is formed just above and below that, but in other breakout cases that doesn't seem to worry it. If it's going to break out it will do it. That's what I'm hoping for. And for a nice long trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #172 ---
This is another pair I've been expecting to break out from consolidation. In this case I decided to wait until it had breached the resistance at the top of the consolidation zone. It has done this in explosive style! Now I need to wait for it to settle down and provide a gentle pullback. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #173 ---
It didn't happen. There was a bit of a breakout but it collapsed back into the range. Eventually the consolidation period has to end. The trick, I guess, is to be there to catch the breakout when it happens.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
A trade opportunity is opening up on this pair (GBPCAD) now that price has dropped below support. I will wait for a pullback, perhaps to that H4 S/R level. The weekly shows a range with price dropping at present. There's about 200 pips to the lower boundary of the range. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Here's another opportunity (EURCHF), just not sure what's going to happen next All of the MAs and current price are packed into a very small area - a strong pinch, in other words. If my extensive backtesting over the end-of-year period is accurate, there should be a good breakout, but I'm hoping for a longer period of sideways movement, which seems to indicate a more powerful breakout. I hope it doesn't break downward because price is very low now - see monthly chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #176 ---
It did break down and too quickly to catch at the time, unless I had placed a speculative order below the consolidation area. I haven't ever traded consolidations in this way, but it seems like a good idea here because I have missed several good breakouts this year already. Now we have a pullback, so I could place a sell stop order as indicated on the H4 chart to catch a possible resumption of the downtrend. If price continues up I could trail the sell order behind it until it is clear price is not coming down. But price is low, so surely sellers are losing interest and buyers gaining interest? Still, there are about 560 pips down to the level I have marked, so it's not like this is a rock-bottom price yet. I confess that using GMMAs is not as easy as it looks, or I haven't found it so. I think it's because there aren't strict or clear rules. Daryl Guppy was clear that the GMMA is intended to be a guide to trend formation and continuation, not a specific trading strategy. I remain convinced that this is a good concept, just that I need to get my head around it. Any comments most welcome! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1) i look for fib retracements but dont use it to enter the trade as the author of the video does. a 50% retracement signifies a healthy trend formation. 2) i always wait for candle to close beyond 10 ema chanel. candles are closing inside the chanel signify consolidation. 3) it ia always better to enter on the first pullback continuation pattern. the risk reward ratio is very good. 4) after entry as long as the candles are closing outside the chanel also signify a strong and healthy trend. 5) i use fibo expansion for target and chanel to trail my stoplosss.

so many ways fibo can help to know how healthy the trend is. Attached Image (click to enlarge) look at the last but 4 bullish candle. exact retracement to 61.8 % mark. still the close is out of the 10 ema channel. the rsi are still below one another and below 50. the next bearish candle opened at 61.8% resistance and closed well outside the 10 ema channel. this confirms a healthy downtrend. if the retracement starts crossing the 50% mark and approaches the 38.2% mark i ususlly get out of the trade irrespective of the profit or loss. it means the trend is not healthy. find a better setup in another instrument rather than getting stuck in a choppy and uncertain trade. first fibo was to see continuation pattern and get a good entry point second fibo for target levels third to make decision to stay in the trade or quit. unlike the speaker in the video you posted Spudfun who is only looking at 50%, better to have a open mind and lateral thinking. "The truth is that trading success is inside our minds and the holy grail is between our ears."

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thank you for your comments here, Rajesh. I have never found the fibo very convincing - so many lines to choose from (23, 38, 50, etc), price has a high probability of reaching one of them. But the way you use it is just about ensuring the momentum of the trend is strong - you don't want a pullback to be the same size as the previous move down - that signals a weak trend. So that's why you want the pullback to stay at least below 50% and ideally below 38.2, and if it goes higher, you lose interest. And on top of that the 10 ema channel gives good confluence. That's very useful insight. I have a question about your entry. When do you decide that price is indeed continuing down again, and what kind of entry do you use and where?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Yellow rectangle is no trade zone as price action is moving above and below Guppy LT EMAs The start of down trend is when the Long term guppy cross . ie 30 ema crossses 60 ema down. (red ema 30 crossing below magenta ema 60) At my entry candle : 1) all LT emas are evenly spread . this is the first criteria. if this is not fulfilled there is no trade. 2) the first candle to close below 10 ema channel.( if this is not fulfilled i consider it as a consolidation hence no trade) 3) rsi 6 should cross below rsi 12 at the same candle and both below 50. 4) supportive criteria but not mandatory : trend line break, flag formation, fib retracement less than 50. identifying the first candle, ie first pullback continuation pattern after the start of the trend gives max profit in minimum time. During trade : remain in trade till all candle close outside 10 ema channel. rsi 6 should remain below rsi 12. if any of above fail, book partial profit and trail rest on ema 10 high. Targets as per fibo extension. T1 for 1 lot T2 book full priiofit. Either trade futures or sell options. i never buy options because the time value detoriates significantly. in selling options time is your second best friend , first being the trend itself.

Hello! How do you filter out assets? Do you go one by one or have some kind of screener?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
i have only 2 indices and 7/8 stocks on my MT4 platform ( active liquid instruments, low spread and low margin requirement). i scan through the charts 15 min before the end of H1 candle till i find a good setup. I keep H1 and D1charts open and take future trades on H1 on completion of the candle. I sell options mostly on D1 timeframe. if i see setup developing on D1 I sell options without waiting for candle to close. i trade only one instrument at a time. so no scanner and no alerts are required. none of brokers in india allow trading from mt4 so no question of EA.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
indian markets are open for 6 hrs a day. so rsi 6 and 12 are equivalent to rsi 1 and 2 on daily timeframe. so for me the daily candle price action is reflected on H1. For D1 charts i use rsi 5 and 10

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I have tried a worked example based on the rules you provided here. I kept my LT Guppy lines as I normally have them. I also looked at the fibo tool but removed it from this chart because it made it very cluttered. The retracement did not breach the 61.8 line and the signal candle closed on the 23.6 line on its way down again, so that also ticked the right boxes. I note that price stopped its strong descent right on the first fibo extension - I think I'm going to look more seriously at this tool in future! Thank you for that. Do you have any comments about my example? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Thank you! This is interesting, because I find my attention spread between too many assets. So if I got you right, you only have 9-10 assets, but try to check them every hour 15m before the 1H candle close while the market is open? How many trades a week or a month do you find this way?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
all my assets are from different sectors so i am in trade every day. in fact i miss a lot of them because i focus on only one trade at a time. trading is not my profession but i am learning as my retirement plan

--- 帖子 #197 ---
absolutely perfect Spudfan. 1) This is the first pullback continuation pattern after the start of the downtrend. also price has again retraced into the LT cluster. this is a second pullback. IF again the candle closes below the 10 ema chanel you can go short again. IMP. Wait for price to enter inside the LT cluster and after that the candle closing outside 10 ema chanel is your entry. dont trade all or any candle closing outside the chanel. nobody can anticipate how long this downtrend will last. but trades taken at the begining of the trend offer a good risk reward ratio. 2) also look at the candles before your entry candle. do they satisfy your pinch criteria ? i suggest you keep your original chart and add the 10 ema and rsi. hope you wont find your chart too cluttered after that 3) Fib retracement is a supporitng criteria but not mandatory for entering the trade. i use it always for setting targets.

--- 帖子 #198 ---

welcome cpfleger can you share your 2022 strategy in details? your inputs are very much appreciated

--- 帖子 #202 ---
After saying this I thought I should use the GMMAs as intended - as a guide to trends (but also looking out for when a "pinch" occurs) and then when a trend has been identified, to switch to my own MA crossover system that I am familiar with and has given me some good results at times. And when it didn't it was more my fault than the system. But then walvekarraje posted the specific steps he uses and that also became a possibility - his and mine both have clear rules to be followed, which is good for me. So I think I'll use both for a while, probably in parallel and see how that goes.

Following walvekarraje's method I placed a sell stop order at the base of the breakout candle. As far as I can see all the criteria have been met. A concern is that there is a support level not far below. This is where I have placed my target. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I usually dont look at support levels. if the trend is strong it will break the support and go further down. draw fibo extension and place your target orders. when price comes to support move stoploss to BE.

use of fib to check if trade is in your direction or not. to stay in trade and carry your position for tomorrow ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) fib applied from previous swing low to swing high. note that the bullish candle did not cross 50% mark. and the last candle was bearish. so the trend is intact. so will carry trade for tomorrow. now that todays close is fairly away fron my entry price, i will shift my stoploss to BE tomorrow at market open. this way even if market reverses tomorrow at least i will not loose money.

fib to set targets Attached Image (click to enlarge) now the fib is applied from the low of breakout/ entry candle (candle closing below ema chanel) to the previous swing high. note that target 1 is above the previous support and target 2 is below it. if the trend is strong the probablity of hitting targets is fairly high. finally tomorrow after market open if price retraces above 50% and/or my BE stoploss is hit.... i will be out of the trade. if not i will wait for my targets.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
what you say Spudfan is absolutely right. " price has a high probability of reaching one of them." if you can use the fib tool correctly the probablity of hitting targets is also very high Plan the trade and then Trade the plan.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
it looks that the price is significantly away from your entry. also the wick has crossed your previous support. so time to move stoploss to BE. Book profit 1) targets reached 2) the 6 rsi goes below 20 level . you can opt to remain in trade till rsi 6 is below rsi 12 or candles are closing outside ema chanels

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I wouldn't say that price is significantly away from the entry - it's about 16 pips away, not even 1R yet. Let me go back and look for your exit rules. That might help clarify. I found this below, my comments in blue During trade : remain in trade till all candle close outside 10 ema channel. So in a sell trade, if the entire candle, body, wicks, the lot closes BELOW the channel we close 100% of the trade, is that a correct understanding? That doesn't sound right. I think you mean all candles in a sell trade should CLOSE below the channel, so if they don't, we book partial profit. That sounds better! rsi 6 should remain below rsi 12. So if the 6 RSI closes above the 12 rsi, we exit 100% ? No, I'm wrong I think. We should take partial profit? if any of above fail, book partial profit and trail rest on ema 10 high. Targets as per fibo extension. T1 for 1 lot T2 book full profit. So the targets apply if none of the above things go wrong and the trade survives?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
"I wouldn't say that price is significantly away from the entry - it's about 16 pips away, not even 1R yet" - sorry, i was just trying to read your chart, i really didnt read the figures. in a sell trade as long as the candle closes below the 10 low ema . the trend is strong even if it is a bullish candle. so remain in the trade. in a sell trade if rsi 6 closes above rsi 12, but as long as both are below 50, you can still be in trade but you need to watch the price action and decide accordingly. but if rsi 6 closes above 50 . definately book profits, partial or total depends on you. i like to take fibo targets because if you are trailing, it takes a lot of time for the 10 high ema ( in a sell trade) to reach that level and you may get stopped in between. rules are guidelines ....... after all " the holy grail is between our ears."

Thank you that really helps - that holy grail between my ears doesn't always do as I want it to.

Hey Rajesh, you did say that price sometimes reacts precisely to fibo levels. Well, how's this? Even though it seems such a random thing, it reacted almost exactly. Like magic. I was out when price reached T1, and you can see what happened. Taking partial profits is a problem for me because I don't think one can set partial targets on MT4, so it has to be done manually.

Rajesh I have a question. In this chart of AUDJPY H4 we have a new trend, two pullbacks and breakouts shown with vertical grey lines. If price now drops from here we might get another breakout candle, but price will not have gone back into the LT GMMAs. In such a case would you trade the breakout candle or just walk away? How important is that revisiting into the LT GMMAs? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #228 ---
the best trades are when the price pulls back into the LT group and the first candle to close outside the 10 ema chanel. otherwise the pullback should be MORE than 50% from previons swing high and low. rest you dont trade. this is also the reason i prefer to book profits at T 2..... because usually after that there is either consolidation or pullback . a very strong trend is the one where all the candles are closing outside the 10 ema chanel. that is where you can decide to stay in the trend till price closes inside the chanel. but here you should trail stoploss .... first to BE... next to T 1 and then to T 2. as in my last post sometimes pullback is so strong that it can take away your profits and sometimes you end up in a loss.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Thank you, again! I've noticed that in most cases, the 50% level is very close to the LT GMMAs anyway, so we are covered either way. The chart below is one such example. Here's a potential trade coming up - EURGBP H4. A new uptrend has been formed. If price stops the current pullback where it is now and continues the uptrend then there will be a breakout, probably tomorrow, the RSIs will meet the requirements and the trade could be on. Are there any reasons anyone can see not to take it (assuming all the conditions are met)? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Only the fact that on higher TFs it is mostly a short. Could be tricky.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
if the trend is to change or reverse it has to do so in the lower timeframes first. here we are trading the time frame and not the instrument. it is good if trade is in direction of higher time frame, but if all conditions are met i dont hesitate to pull the trigger. after that it is only money management. keeping losses to minimum is more important after entering a trade. a strategy with well defined set of rules / guidelines for entry, stoploss, trail and profit targets is what is required. Plan the trade and then trade the plan

--- 帖子 #232 ---
i would like to add volume to my chart. that is a very important parameter in change of trend. unfortunately MT4 shows tick volume and not the actual volume. i sometimes refer to my broker data and chart. it helps

--- 帖子 #233 ---
That's what I noticed too, which is why I asked that question. And here's our answer ... There's still a way to go on that pair - first the pullback, then the breakout and a lot can change in that time. Wait and see. Trust the system.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Has anyone done a study on the success rate of the Dr Walvekar method? (I think it deserves a proper title). I suspect it has a pretty high probability of success, particularly if one counts just the first pullback and breakout after the trend change.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I have just done a rough-and-ready count of wins and losses on the four-hourly TF from 1 Jan last year to now across three pairs chosen randomly - AUDCAD, EURGBP and GBPJPY. The totals across these three (and very similar to each other) was 30 wins, 6 losses and 2 B/E. Average 10/2/1 per pair. Two observations from this are (1) the obvious, that this is a high probability system and (2) to maximise returns it would be necessary to find ways of letting trades run - there are some big wins to be had, we just need to let them happen.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
38 trades in 12+ months - that's 13 per pair a year. Once a month on average. What capital does one need to at least sustain a living from it? If you're away from PC when you need to place a trade, one needs to wait another month.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
True, but remember I was counting only the first pullback/breakout pattern in each new trend. Walvekarraje suggests two of them before the probabilities drop off. Also, how many pairs do you have open? If you pair off all the majors it's 28, but let's say we have 20. 20 x 13 = 260. Or more if you can pick up the second pullback/breakout (and a few more losses, I guess). In a normal trading year one will have about 200 to 230 trading days. So with those numbers it's more than 1 trade a day. All of that is wishful thinking, of course, because we are going to make mistakes and do stupid things. We'll also miss trades that go past while we are out or sleeping or at work. But it gives an idea of what is possible.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
And that's what happened. A whole host of potential trades came through during my sleeping time and this morning only a few of them are still suitable to trade. So we can add another reason to the above list of why we will miss trades - they might all come through in a rush and we can't take them all, even if we are awake. I placed this AUDJPY trade this morning. It's the second take at the pullback/breakthrough pattern since the new trend formed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

For learning purposes I would like to ask for comment on this potential trade. This is the first pullback after a new trend formed. For now without referring to other time-frames, just using what we see on the chart and based on the Walvekar method, would this be a good short trade when price closes below the lower 10MA (which would be somewhere near that blue line)?

thank you for your kind words sir. i am honoured especially coming form a senior person like you. also i want to thank you for giving life to a dead thread, at least i can express my thoughts, strategy and rules. " 30 wins, 6 losses and 2 B/E. Average 10/2/1 per pair." your analysis is very accurate. though i dont keep ajournal, i am trading a live account and i can guess my success rate from my available balance. guppy mma is a trend trading method. but the entry and exits are not very well defined by him in his published literature. i literally tried many indicators, candle patterns, divergences , flags and what not. looking back at charts and making a strategy is very easy..... in live charts it is not so.i found that the 10 ema chanel is the best way for me . " we are going to make mistakes and do stupid things." i have also done too many as every one of us. only i used to take one lot one trade at a time to concentrate on how the market works. all of us including me want to get is at the lowest and book profit at the highest... i realised it is not possible. thats the reason i posted my live trades and rules and the follow up also. oohoo asked " How many trades a week or a month do you find this way?" one profitable trade at a time is sufficient mate when you are confident, increase the number of lots or add to existing positions or trail stoploss so you get max profit. lastly ..... guppy gmma is a trend trading system. so rather than trying to get in at lowest and book profit at the highest....let the trend get established before you enter. hence we trade the first or second pullback. trail SL once the trade goes in your direction. any time you feel insecure about your entry (and always your inner sense is right), book loss and exit. use fibo extensions or any other method to book profits ( and run away with profit in your pocket ) "Plan the Trade and Trade the Plan" please ignore my spelling mistakes and grammer. english is not my native language

I'm also happy to have got this thread going again and especially for your willing contributions.

The above was "rough-and-ready". With more time available I went back and reviewed the AUDCAD pair from 1 January to 31 December last year using the F12 function key (on a PC) to give a candle-by-candle viewing, thereby keeping the future hidden off-screen. It's the closest to live trading I can get. I also used the following personal adaptations of the Walvekar method to suit my own style and experience: Trade only the first pullback and breakout pattern (this is more to do with the testing than my personal preferences. It would be interesting to repeat the exercise but trading the first and second pullback/breakouts). If price makes an explosive and large break beyond the 10 EMA channel (i.e. on the the entry candle) and becomes "stretched" (overbought/sold) I do not enter as price is very likely to bounce back or even swing onto the other side of the LT EMAs. If the EMAs are close together and going sideways I also avoid entering a trade. Move to B/E at 50 pips (this helps with backtesting to keep things consistent). Trail the stop using the next lower TF's swing points. In my case that's H1 and I trail on the second swing point back. One could also use Guppy's countback method - it ends up being similar to this. My results for those 12 months are: 8 wins (438 pips), 3 losses (50 pips), 1 B/E. Total gain was 388 pips. The largest trade was 102 pips, so for this pair setting a fixed target of around 150 pips might capture more of the gains than a trailing stop can, but on other pairs it might cut short an enormous trade.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Interesting. If I backtest the second pullback and breakout I get the following results: 3 wins (179 pips), 2 losses (92 pips), 2 B/E. With that 3/2/2 result the honours are almost even. Total gain was 87 pips. Not worth spending much energy and time on when there are another 27 major pair demanding attention. This is just AUDCAD, H4, of course. It doesn't mean other pairs are not going to work on the second pullback/breakout.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I have backtested 5 different currency pairs as described above. They experienced around 12-15 potentially usable trend changes in the year. Not all of those met the requirements and so the number of tradeable trends was around 8 per pair for the year of 2021, or if using 20 pairs, it's 160 tradeable new trends, with two pullback/breakout patterns on offer each time. The first pullback/breakout pattern performed better than the second one most of the time, but the second one did well enough to make it worth trading (the AUDCAD example above must be a low-performer). Most of the trades taken were successful, some, due to the trend-following technique I used, were monsters! The top three trades were 407 pips, 370 pips and 263 pips, respectively. So, having done all of that and assuming things continue this way in 2022, this seems to be a good strategy to follow. It works well for me because it is rules-based. I should mention that CADCHF went through 19 potentially usable trend changes (it was choppy a lot of the time), of which only 8 met the requirements. It was a frustrating pair to backtest - all over the place. If that's how it's going to be into the future I will ignore it.

Well done! You seem to pump out similar successful trades almost daily. I'm seeing that your approach is short-term (or even intra-day?), whereas what I did for my backtesting is a longer-term approach. Yours is based on H1 and has nearby targets set using the fibo tool in a particular way. Mine is based on H4 and attempts to exploit the trend-following nature of the GMMAs by trailing a stop as far as it will go. Have I understood this correctly? I like this variety (assuming the longer-term one works as well as the backtesting suggested it does) because traders are all different and some might prefer one while others might prefer the other. I'm now pursuing the longer-term approach live to see what I can do with it.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Here's a possible trade coming up on CADJPY H4. A new trend formed, then pulled back into a messy consolidation and now it might break out. It's following the familiar broad pattern so far but I don't feel comfortable with that messy bit. Comments anyone? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #254 ---
yes. you are partly right . GMMA helps me to identify the trend and my entry. i trade only one instrument at a time. but i use a combination of futures and options to trade it. for a long trade i will buy two lots of future and sell one put option. ( strike price is T 2 of fibo ). book future lots at T1 and T2 and let the option trade run till the end. when price reaches T2 my option becomes out of the money and all out of the money options expire worthless. though the profit in option selling is limited, it becomes a stress free trade. trend is your best friend and time is your second best also in post 163 ( https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...1#post13843131 ) i have also described how i use the same system to build portfolio. this is like a quiver full of arrows. decide yourself which arrow to use and when

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Do I get it right that your TP1 has a RR ratio below 1?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Finally, we have a breakout. I'm going to trail the stop down the H1 swing highs to see how far I can get (using the swing high that is one before the current one to avoid being stopped out too soon). It's not a system that collects maximum returns for each trade, but from my backtesting, when you get a big one it more than makes up for having a bunch of smaller ones along the way. The big thing is to avoid losses as much as possible. Part of that is to enter when there is a high probability of a successful trade (which the Walvekar method seems to do) and the other is to move to B/E after around 1R. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
a one line question requires a detailed answer. 1) we are trading a system with some basic fixed rules. rules can be followed, bent or broken....... but with some logic. 2) in any strong trend the entry candle low/high is NEVER broken. but we have been made to think that when we enter a trade the previous swing high or low is our stoploss. and then you calculate risk reward ratio according to your stoploss. just have a look at the post previous to the one you quoted. if price moves beyond 50% the trend is not strong , move your SL to ema 10 high. you may get stopped out with minimal loss. but you will always get better opportunites. 3) i use TP1 to move my SL to BE. T2 I always book profit for 1 lot. 4) after TP2, as long as candles are closing outside 10 ema chanel, remain in the trade.... when candle closes inside the chanel, move SL to high/ low of that candle. 5) lastly when candle closes and rsi 6 is below 20/above 80.... book profit and get out of the trade.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Another nugget. This will help me put together the section in walvekarraje's collected writings on managing the trade.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
trade is not RR. it is keeping losses to minimum and making max profits

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Right. Just wanted to understand if I got you right in terms of entry and TPs.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Do you think you could paste here what you've got so far? Dr's posts are scattered around, and I'm trying to get a TV template for this. Incidentally, I'm experimenting with a similar system. I use EMA-50 in a clear trend as a sensitive point waiting for a reaction there. I'm just not quite sure what the trigger should be (sometimes entering the 10-EMA hi/low works). Something along these lines.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Let me tidy it up a bit and I'll post it tomorrow. I was hoping to put in illustrations throughout, but that can come later I guess, all of us here will be able to find examples without too much trouble.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Update: I'm waiting for walvekarraje to comment and assist with the document. It's his work and I don't want to misrepresent him. He hasn't received my PM yet.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
i have sent you my email.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thank you. My work on that document has really helped clarify things for me. Here is a trade I am now in, USDCAD H4. The chart explains it all. Next will be to set targets and manage the trade - it's all described in the document I'm a bit concerned that the long-term EMAs have flattened out a bit, but walvekarraje has a plan to get out of a trade quickly if things do head south. I must just go and read up on that bit.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I placed this trade yesterday, a bit prematurely, perhaps, but it caught today's big move. I have just taken partial profits at T1 and moved to B/E. Will now hope to get to T2, but from here it's a free trade. This chart illustrates how walvekarraje recommends using the fibo tool to set targets, drawing it from the tip of the breakout candle down to the recent swing low. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #267 ---
going through your document sir. very very well summarised. few corrections, give me some time

--- 帖子 #268 ---
i always apply fibo in the direction of the trend. so your 0 level should be down and 100 level up. ( non conventional but thats how i do it ) as long as pullback is inside the LT group and subsequent continuation pattern, the fibo levels should not matter. also a higher high and higher low is clearly seen on your chart. so this should be a good entry.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
hi oohoo, in your chart, ema 50 crossing below ema 200 is start of your downtrend. after that the bearish candle closing below the ema channel is your entry candle ( 5 th candle after the 19 vertical line) after that the same rules apply what we are discussing here. but if you delete the ema channel, i cant guess how the rest of the indicators will help you to enter the trade.( off course there must be some rules) no offence intended , i am just trying to stress the importance of the channel.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Right, I was thinking that waiting for the EMA-50 touch is too long and the trend gets exhausted by then. In this case, how would you formalize the pullback - price closing above the EMA-channel? [I have more indicators than I need for I may notice sth interesting eventually - exploratory interest so to say.]

--- 帖子 #271 ---
all candles after 50/200 cross closing inside channel is consolidation/distribution . first candle to close below 10 ema low, small upper wick, zero lower wick... indicates a strong bearish candle.... continuation pattern. rest is to trail SL on 10 ema high etc etc....

--- 帖子 #272 ---

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Walvekarraje, I would be grateful if you could comment on this chart. We have a new trend and then a fairly deep pullback - it went beyond the LT EMAs is that a problem? - yet it didn't breach the 61.8 fibo level. What is your approach to this situation? What guidance can you give when we get a deep pullback? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #277 ---

--- 帖子 #278 ---
LT group too compressed. first criteria not satisfied. better to wait for next pullback and a good trend is established.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Analyse LT guppy 1) no compression 2) direction maintained this indicates strong strength in trend A in the image above : young breakouts are weak, with high probablity of trend collapse.( star in the image) The second arrow in image is LT compression......the line indicates direction and formation of a trend. the side arrow in the image is where the price action comes back to LT guppy, without causing compression and bounces back into the trend ( guppy calls this Rally Cap). THIS is our entry point. we identify this by the candle crossing our 10 ema channel. Guppy says " No trend can survive without the support from long term traders " i hope this answers your querry Spudfan . Analyse the LT guppy first.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Back to Guppy basics! Forgot about that. Perhaps we should put a comment along these lines in the document we are working on. Guppy also specifies that a clear gap must open up between the ST and LT groups. At present on this pair there's no gap at all. So a quick flip across to my "Guppy" template would have answered my question without having to ask you.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
If I had used basic Guppy theory here I would never have entered this trade. Where's that emoji for hitting my head on the desk? The remaining portion of this trade still survives, and it might even allow me to get out at B/E, but that's more down to luck than following the rules and remembering Guppy. Where's the gap?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
thank you very much sir for your time and efforts. i am truely grateful

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Thank you a lot guys for your work! So do you basically use Guppy's standard settings for identifying LT trend? Yesterday Dr Rajesh noticed that a cross of 50 and 200 EMA can work for that (my basic premise). I've also noticed that EMA-channel crossing EMA-50 can also show trend.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I have added the short-term EMAs to my chart in a dull colour so they don't clutter things up. If you look closely you'll see them on my chart. The chart shows we have a pullback that has become a longish period of consolidation. Now we potentially have a breakout candle (waiting for the close still) and the RSIs are all doing the right thing. I might have been tempted to go for this, if the breakout candle closes below the channel, because I know breakouts from consolidation are usually strong. But if you look closely, those dull red lines show the S/T EMAs are still mixed in with the L/T ones, so nothing like a strong trend, even though the technicals are positive. I'm going to keep those S/T lines on my charts so I don't forget. What I'm realising more clearly is that the method that walvekarraje has developed reacts strongly as soon as a trend shows weakness. To me it seems his rules for taking partial profit/loss or exiting 100% are strict. But there's a reason for that - we don't want to be messing with poorly performing trends. My tendency would be to wait, give the trade room to breathe as they say. Well maybe that's why I lose a lot of the time. Maybe I'm too much of an optimist. But now we are looking at small losses or B/Es early on in a trade, but if the trend shows it is strong, we stay in and potentially for a decent amount. Does that sound like a fair assessment?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
where is the breakout ? where is the pullback ? no place to draw fib..... if this is H4 chart, the price is chopping around the LT guppy for many days. there is no trend. i will never trade this chart on guppy rules. to trade this.... draw trendlines above and below. it will form a descending triangle. wait for break of trendlines, after that wait for pullback to its previous support area (which will become resistance after trendline break) and then trade the continuation.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Here you go ... But it was just an example showing that by including the ST group it is clearly not a trade, even though most of the other elements are in place. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Yesterday’s discussion made me stop and think that we could make better use of the Guppy MMA system. We said in the Walvekar document that All L/T EMAs must be evenly spread . This is the first criterion. if this is not fulfilled there is no trade. There should be a clear gap between the S/T and L/T groups of EMAs. How better to make sure those criteria are met than to use the GMMAs uncluttered and without any other distractions? Some while back I made a “GMMA plain” template but never used it. Now I think it might be useful. On the chart a long downtrend ends on the left. It doesn’t take much effort to see that we have a no go area after that and it’s only after the vertical line that we should start paying attention. That might be a good time to flip over to the standard Walvekar template. Probably flipping between the two would help keep focus. It's something to explore in the coming week. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
This is the plain GMMA version of the chart that walvekarraje was commenting on. Clearly, there's no trade for us here.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Sir, a request make the same template with MA IN COLOR indicator i have shared. it will help your analysis of guppy mma to a great extent.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thank you for your concern. I tend to get distracted by having too many things on the chart, as you saw with that CADJPY example I used. So for me it's useful to take a step back and look just at the big picture with nothing to distract from that. For that reason I specifically want nothing on the "plain Guppy" template but the Guppy lines, not even price bars, because the Guppy system is what lies at the heart of what we are doing and I think, or expect, that starting with the plain Guppy chart will help me see the formation of a proper trend more clearly. That is not to say that the Walvekar template (if I may call it that) is not useful. Far from it, and I will be using both templates to get the best value from each. Once I am satisfied that a decent trend is in place I can go to the more detailed chart and see what the RSIs are doing and where price is in relation to the channel and such like. I will follow this course during next week and see how it goes. I hope this helps explain and puts your mind at ease.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I've just been looking around and saw that the GBPCHF pair looks interesting on the plain chart. It shows a strong new trend, a sharp pullback to the HT EMAs and then a resumption of the trend. The LT lines have separated and there's a clear gap between the LT and ST groups. On the plain chart it is very clear. (Please scroll down). Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, the Walvekar chart shows a problem. Apart from the initial breakout candle, the rest have all closed inside the channel. That didn't show up on the plain chart. (For interest, note how the pullback extends so precisely to the 50% level). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Which would you say is the 1st pullback (that is the best one to trade)? EDIT: I think it's the 2nd pullback, because on the 1st there was no compression of LT EMAs. Pity.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
They are both pullbacks, no doubt, and both tradable, but the Walvekar method calls for pullbacks to the LT group or at least to the 50% fibo level, so not the first one, but the second one touches the top level of the LT group, so yes, it would be the second one. I think it's actually better not to have compression of the LT group, but I would prefer walvekarraje to make a call on this question you are asking as he has spent many years working this system out.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
hi oohoo, when your fast ema has crossed above slow ema , that is your change in treng. after that, one or few candles closing in the channel or preferably below the channel is first pullback ( you have correctly marked). after that the first candle closing above the channel is your entry candle. this candle should be close to the LT group. closer the better. also there is no compression of the LT group. so i will definately go long on the first pullback you have marked. a if you draw a fib i am sure you will find retracement between 38.2% - 50%. "on the 1st there was no compression of LT EMAs. Pity."...... no compression is our first criteria and a good sign. and same is true for second pullback.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thank you! You have confirmed what I thought. I'd be willing to try and take only first pullbacks for the time being.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
let me try to explain the logic. we are tought to consider previous highs and lows as support and resistance areas. but these are static areas or zones. but in a strong trend these are easily broken and it is unlikely that the price will never return to these zones in near future. the LT guppys are dynamic areas of support. a compression means the support is weakening, expansion means the support is getting stronger. similarly the 10 ema channel is our dynamic support and candle closing beyond the channel without guppy compression means that the existing trend is strong and will continue..... similarly rsi crossing 50, macd crossing zero, tdi cross, moving average cross over........all indicate areas of dynamic support. the reason for not using ST guppys is that they are so close to each other that it is difficult to interprete them. the 10 ema channel is far easier and clearer for analysis.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Do you have an idea why this entry would have failed? (I didn't take the trade, just researching). It's 1st pullback. 50% retrace is in place. RSI cross in place. I don't mean to say that all trades must be winners, maybe it's just one of those non-winners? Or was there something about the setup, which should have alerted me?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I'd be interested to see the standard Guppy chart for this instrument. Could you do that?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
sir, the use of color ma is th make reading the chart easier. just a change in color will tell you compression or expansion long before it is evident to naked eye otherwise. change in channel color will make entry or exit easier. take a note of the yellow color on the line this,is the only leading indicator i know . change from red to yellow to blue...... points to the exact single candle where uptrend is resuming. (and it is non repainting..... all our indicators are, except zigzag) Attached Image (click to enlarge) also note the rsi in color. one glance at the chart and you know what is happening

--- 帖子 #301 ---
lastly about rsi... 1) depends on what setting are used . rsi 6 will cross 50 much earlier than rsi 14 0r rsi 21.( same is true for all other oscillators like macd, stochastics, tdi, cci etc) indian markets are 6 hrs a day. so on hourly chart i use 6 and 12 rsi, means that i understand what is happening in the last 2 daily candles. i am not concerned what happeneg 14 or 21 days back. 2) rsi above 50 is uptrend and below 50 is downtrend. rsi between 60 to 80 is strong uptrend, when rsi goes beyond 80 you have to consider taking profits off the table. 3) rsi 6 crossing below 12 and/or both crossing 50 in opposite direction ..... get out of the trade irrespective of profit and loss. that is the logic behind the charts

--- 帖子 #302 ---
so for 4 hr/daily charts rsi setting should be according to weekly candles if this logic has to work.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Thank you! I don't think I have seen this explanation before. And without the price bars we can see the various lines very clearly. I can see how useful it would be. The only Walvekar rules I know are the ones we have already put into the document we posted. Perhaps we should add a bit to it and link the two?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
" it's just one of those non-winners?" yes. dont expect all trades to be winners. there is no holy grail. "Or was there something about the setup, which should have alerted me?" i see it is a hourly chart. so, how many hourly candles in your day?. if it is more than 6 hrs, you should change your rsi setting according to my previous post and probably you will find your answer.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
if we use one templete at least for discussion, it will be easier. and yes, we will upgrade the document as our understnding grows.

I have managed to put together most of the elements in your template. It took a bit of fiddling, but I've got it. My Guppy lines don't look exactly like yours. I used 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60. Also, what settings do you use for your Zigzag triad lines? The one you posted has 12, 5 and 3 but it is significantly different from what appears on your chart.

And ignore challenges such as the one just posted.

Nice trade, well done! I have used the settings you gave for the Zigzag indicator and it looks correct. Thank you. How do you use this indicator? I have seen it on your charts but don't recall you ever referring to it except to say that a strong trend usually breaks though such a level.

it is amazing how price reacts to fib levels.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1)after hitting T 3 to the pip, it retraced to T 2 to the pip. so if i would not have booked profit at T3, i would have lost a significant chunk of my profit if my trail was at T2 2) as anticipated by rsi 6 going below 20, see the pullback. though the trend is still intact, it is important to book profits at intervals. to re enter the trend again, i will be waiting for a flag formation.

US30 is in retracement consolidation. what you say is right. wait for candle to close above ema channel. still 2 hrs 50 min from my clock. does your chart look the same? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #331 ---
but the LT guppy is compressed. so if you trade , you will be trading the breakout and not the first pullback here. our first criteria is not satisfied. do you agree spudfan?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
You could try a TV filter to filter out possible pairs. Not many that I see, but I think those settings should be right to give a heads-up of a possible setup.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I agree - see my annotated chart. Most of the elements are in place but it's the LT group that counts against a trade at present. My plan is to wait and see how it develops. Something I'm noticing with the colour-changing MAs is that, once the lines have all changed to the same type of colour (either red/magenta or blue/green), you can almost close your eyes and press go. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Yes, it looks the same. Two observations 1) When EMA-channel contains LT EMAs, we are in consolidation with a chance of strong breakout (which way? any hints for us - divergences maybe?) 2) I would hate to confuse you bringing in more concepts into a working system, but when you see CCIs of high lengths (my lower screen, purple CCI is 200) trading inside the -100+100 zone, you're more likely to have a consolidation. Look at how well Guppy worked earlier, when CCIs showed downtrend.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
and the rsi too should agree with the color.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
And that, yes! I have a question on the colours of the RSIs - what causes the colours to change? It's not when they cross each other and it's not when they are above or below any particular level. What is it?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
as we had discussed the logic of rsi 6/12, cci 200 is too far setting to be in sync with our chart. the higher the setting, the more lagging the oscillator will be. honestly i have tried several other indicators and oscillators and different settings to compliment guppy. finally ema10 channel and rsi are the best.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
it is simple. if the value of current candle is less than the previous candle they are red and vise versa. if the value of current candle is more than previous candle but less than but less than the (-2) candle they become yellow.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
" young breakouts are weak, with high probablity of trend collapse" " No trend can survive without the support from long term traders " these are two very important sentences in guppy literature. thats why i avoid trading breakouts and trade pullbacks. in my notebook stands the word "Wait".... Spudfan you should add these two sentences in front of "Wait"

--- 帖子 #340 ---
This is one of the pairs I was watching yesterday. The ST group has pulled away from the LT group. The LT lines are now evenly spread. Also, all lines are now "blue/green". T1 is 60 pips away and T2 is 155 pips away - both decent targets. I will place a buy stop order at the tip of the breakout candle. With targets (ST group was removed from chart)

--- 帖子 #341 ---
The above GBPJPY trade going nicely now. This GBPCHF trade might break out at the next close. The only thing that I don't like is the period between the pullback and today's possible breakout candle. Not sure if that means something or it can be ignored? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Kunjani umnumzane yaseSwatini

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Looks like today is a good one. Here is a USDJPY trade. As the first target was not a long way from the entry I placed my entire TP at T2. I have already trailed my stop up the H1 swing lows, so there's less at risk now. Will move to B/E at around 50 pips and trail from there. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Not sure you can see 2H candles. This looks promising. EURCHF 2h

--- 帖子 #344 ---
You take the 2nd pullback?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It does look promising on H2, although I can't see that TF. On H4 it looks distinctly like a bubble (see attached document) so it would pay to be cautious. On this chart I simply clicked on line chart and set its colour to "None". Then to get the full Guppy picture I added the ST EMAs manually using a dull colour so as not to get a migraine! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I have had two very precise moves on my first target, but both missed by a whisker. Maybe it would be wise to place the TP a few pips below the fibo level in future. I have actually done that, which is why the first move up looks like it should have hit the TP. I have kept faith because the GMMAs are indicating a bullish bias, the candles have all closed above the channel, and all the line colours are blue-green. The one small concern is that the RSIs are looking a bit flat.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Seems like GBP is generally bullish. I entered this GBPUSD trade this morning. The LT EMAs look like they are too tight in this image, and they are a bit tight and flat, but in the plain Guppy chart they are nicely spread apart with a good gap between the ST and LT group.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
First target hit (finally!) on this GBPJPY trade, moved to B/E and will now trail the stop while aiming for T2. I have an EA that will trail the stop up an MA, in this case it is set to follow the lower line of the channel.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Have you accounted for spread? It is a trick with some brokers.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
What would you say to this entry?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
The technicals are in place (1st pullback/breakout, breakout candle in place, RSIs good, LT group spread). But it's difficult to say without seeing all of the Guppy lines, whether there is a clear gap between the ST and LT groups (yet). It would also be very helpful if you could get all four of your main lines (the LT outer lines as well as the channel lines) to change colour in the same way as the RSIs do. I am finding that when all four of those colours are (in this bullish case) blue-green, then it counts for a lot. I suspect it would be premature right now to enter this trade based on the Walvekar rules. Those flat and possibly even contracting LT outer lines, remind me of my GBPUSD trade today where those lines were close and flat - that trade didn't work out. Having said all that, I have never traded stocks, and their behaviour might not be the same as forex pairs?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Thank you for your thoughts! I'll try to work with colours. What do you mean when you say "whether there is a clear gap between the ST and LT groups (yet)"? As far as I understand, it's necessary to have that gap as trend establishes itself (and we've had this gap in my example).

--- 帖子 #353 ---
1 ) first pullback 2) no LT compression 3) channel break 4) rsi agree 5 ) looks like aarround 50 50% fib retracement Time to pull the trigger on close of candle

--- 帖子 #354 ---
when the price action is in or very near to LT group, the ST cluster is very difficult to analyse, that is the reason why i replaced them with 10ema channel. no LT compression means the trend is strong and investors are supporting the trend. adding color to mas helps us to identify trend change before it happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge) note : here in this pic i am using ST settings 3,4,5 6,7 8, 9, 10high, 10 low. so when all mas are on one side of the chanel, the trend is strong. in practice i only use 10 ema channel. change in color and price closing beyond ema channel is enough for me to evaluate strength of the trend.

On those colours, I'm not sure how walvekarraje has them in his setup but it took me a bit of fiddling to get all of those lines to display that auto-colour-changing property. I would really encourage you to get that sorted. As I posted a few days ago, I am coming around to thinking that that quality is a core feature: "Something I'm noticing with the colour-changing MAs is that, once the lines have all changed to the same type of colour (either red/magenta or blue/green), you can almost close your eyes and press go." Regarding the gap, rather go with walvekarraje's comment on this as I'm still trying to get my head around the subtleties.

great kd. trading news is extremly difficult. retail traders should not . always better to trade after the news impact. one more suggestion. on entry, place your stoploss at opp ema channel, if you are not monitoring the trade... if you are monitoring the trade, and price moves more than 50% of your entry candle, shift SL to entry candle high/low. at least your loss will be minimal. in a healthy ternd, the high/low of entry candle is never breached.

I hope this helps. I didn't annotate this, but the pullback very neatly reaches the LT EMAs (and the fibo 50% level almost exactly) before resuming in the direction of the trend. Now I am just waiting for a breakout from the channel and it's time to pull the trigger. But not on a Friday afternoon, unfortunately. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Stopped out by my trailing stop at the lower channel line. The previous candle had closed above the channel, so there was no candle close inside the channel yet to make me partially close anything or take other action. As the general bias is bullish, this trade *should* continue up. I'm in two minds about setting the stop on the channel boundary. The logic of this practice is clear though. We want to get out of any trade that does not display a strong trend as in all candles closing outside the channel, so closing soon or decisively like this is the right thing to do. On the other hand, if we are using the GMMAs as a trend following system shouldn't we trust it and give the trade more space, eg set the stop below the previous swing low? Having said all that - look at these pure Guppy lines. The answer is clear. I need to be more choosy.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
as suggested by walvekarraje we can adjust the Sl on entry candle Hi or low (If the trend is strong it'll never crossed the hi or low) or we can trail the sl but sometimes trail sl usually hit easily , imo managing the existing trade is still a tough battle this is where fear &amp; greed comes up and in return either we close in loss or left the pips on table

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Thanks kd1 for your comment. Yes, walvekarraje does say that, but I was following what appears in the Walvekar method document (see below) where it refers to the candle closing. Maybe if it is clear the trade is going wrong we can just close it anyway. But I was out at that time so my trailing SL had to do the job. It's just how things go, I suppose. The channel test : A trade is considered strong as long as the candles close beyond / outside the 10 EMA channel. This is true even if you get a bullish candle in a downtrend or a bearish candle in an uptrend. But, if a candle closes inside the channel, it signals weakness, so move the SL to break-even if in the early stages of the trade or to the inner end of that candle (the end closest to the L/T MAs) if in significant profit. Also consider taking partial profit The RSI test : Consider taking profit if RSI 6 does not remain below RSI 12 (for a sell). If RSI 6 closes above RSI 12, but both remain below 50% , you can stay in the trade, but you need to watch the price action and decide accordingly. If RSI 6 closes above 50%, definitely book profits, partial or total depends on you.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Agreed, both of his method are standard part of this System and if still sl is getting hit then there is no harm i guess , what i observed is generally 60 to 70% of the time my targets got hit and there are 30% of the time where my sl got hit ( when i put it on channel hi or low) so this is fine i guess , also what i usually do is i split my position size into two trades like i usually open 0.20 lot fixed so i split into 2 orders 0.1 each and i closed my my order when i get set target like 10 pips or so rest i keep it open at channel high or low.. just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #379 ---
It's worth more than 2 cents . It's very useful for newcomers to this system to be discussing it and trying to work it out properly. What you said about trailing on the channel is something I also thought about. If we are choosy and go for only the stronger trends where the candles close outside the channel, then trailing on the channel isn't a problem. The question is how to pick a stronger trend - it's easy to see it after it's happened, less so live.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
yeah things are looking very pretty and attractive on Left but the real battle is on Right Hand Side as far as stronger trend is concern i think we can predict it by checking the Gap or Compression between LT &amp; ST guppy, the more the gap or distance strong is the trend i guess, what Say ?

Patience Paid off, Hit TP and dropping like falling Knife

--- 帖子 #382 ---
hi guys, for me it is simple. 1) enter trade by identifying a single breakout candle as per rules with 2 lots. 2) always keep stoploss at opp 10 ema channel for both the lots. so my risk is defined. 3) book one lot at TP 1 or R:R= 1 4) shift SL of remaining lot to BE. and target to TP 2. try to catch the momentum of the trade to book profits. anytime durig the trade if the momentum is not strong exit trade with minimum profit/loss.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
It is simple but, for me at least, it isn't. The devil is in the detail. The problem sits between my ears I have reviewed my trades of last week and identified some of my mistakes. To help that process I replicated the daily EMA 30 and 60 lines onto the H4 chart. It's easy to do - there are 6 H4 periods in a day, so multiply EMA 30 by 6 (= EMA 180 on H4), likewise EMA 60 by 6 (= EMA 360 on H4) and you get replicas of the daily lines. Now I can view the daily trend without leaving the H4 chart. It's especially useful when the daily lines are mixed in with the H4 lines. Then things really are going sideways. Or if, for example, the daily lines are trending downwards, it's probably not helpful to buy an otherwise good bullish setup on H4. I made mostly basic mistakes like trading while the MAs were flat and too close to each other. I also realised that the changing colours, amazing as they are, misled me into ignoring basic price action. In one case I had a perfect new trend/pullback/breakout scenario. BUT, that entire "new trend" on H4 was just a pullback on the daily and it reversed at the daily LT EMAs not long after I entered. Onward and upward!

Nice one. I looked at this earlier today and was tempted, but gave it a miss because it is only about 90 pips away from a long-term support level. This might make no difference on H1, but all traders around the world can see the same thing, so it's possible that price might slow down. This is the monthly chart.

First, thank you, Spudfan, for heads up on CADJPY on Friday. I entered on the 2h, EMA colour change, right before the spike (there was dump later, but it didn't matter). Had I waited for 4h, I would have failed. Second, can you guys reiterate whether colour change entry is a method in itself? By the looks of it, it gives earlier entries, but not as reliable as EMA-channel exit method.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Is anyone monitoring any pairs, stocks, other assets? I'm keeping an eye on these eurchf - 2h eurgbp - 1h 2h eurusd - 3h gbpnzd (??) - 90m Is this one worthy of being watched or too messy?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
As long as you made some pips on it! In my opinion the colour change approach is an entry method in its own right, but, as you point out, it looks like it will give plenty of false signals. You want to get in early, you pay for it! But if you can support it with other price action filters, for example ensuring that you are trading with the higher time-frame trend then it might be a great strategy. The problem when so many pairs are going sideways is that we will get many more false colour-change signals. EDIT: I've been thinking about this - perhaps to overcome the persuasiveness of the colour-chaging MAs, we should set up a template with fixed-colour lines while we do our initial scanning and checking for potential trades. Once we have done that we could flip over to the colour-changing template as a further check that the colours are all lined up, in other words, a secondary, not a primary tool. Just a thought, but I know how visually I work and how those lovely colours are so seductive!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
GBPNZD only presented conditions for entry, although the setup didn't look perfect. I've been trying to get my head around what I didn't like about it, and I still can't say. Formally, conditions are OK (except the 'form' of the Guppy maybe). What would you say?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Yes it is perplexing! All the "technicals" are in place (new trend, pullback to the LT group, the pullback is held by the 50% fibo level, RSIs are correct, candle breaks out of channel. There are two price action features I can see. First is that zoomed out on H4 this pair has been trending up unbroken since 16 November last year. That is a very long trend and for that reason alone I have ignored this pair on the basis that all trends come to an end and this one's sell-by date has surely passed. Secondly, on H4 we have a lower high and lower low (now that I look for it in hindsight ). But otherwise, I think it would be helpful to us all if walvekarraje could comment.

GBPUSD has been (very) sideways for a while, with a slight bullish bias. The price action has been above the daily 30 and 60 EMAs. So I'm beginning to wonder when this pair will break out to the upside. Are we looking at it happening now? I don't think so, everything is still too sideways. Maybe when price breaks out of the daily channel. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nicely done! So if I'm reading your chart and text correctly, you took partial profit at T1 and then moved your stop to the opposite end of the green candle, which stopped you out almost immediately with most of that profit still intact?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
yes sir. whenever rsi 6 goes above 80 or below 20, it is extremly overbought or oversold instrument. most likely the price will pullback. it does not mean change of trend and trend might conrinue after some degree of pullback. but it is better to take profits and find another setup. if you see the chart , todays last candle also satisfies our criteria.also the next support is significantly low. but with present volatility, i will wait for tomorrow for market to open.

How does this possible trade look? Does it meet the criteria and not have any other issues anyone can see?

absolutely right. more than that there are few blue emas above 60 ema. so trend is not yet formed.

possibaly..... 1) the entry candle is not a bullish candle closing above the ema. 2) ideally both rsi should cross from below 50 above and eachother on the same candle to indicate a continuation pattern. i really dont know how the forex market works but before trading any instrument i check the index and the sector of the instrument. they should be in the same trend .

Hi walvekarraje, forex markets are open 24 hours per day for 5 days a week (less a few minutes at the daily close for admin purposes). Of course there are busy sessions and quiet sessions. We have three main sessions, usually named London, New York and Tokyo sessions. The busiest time is the London/New York overlap.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Interesting point, brought up by Rajesh for the second time already. I'm not sure that changing RSI to 24 and 48 on 1h to accommodate for 1d and 2 days would be right, because RSI gets very "heavy" this way. 6-8 for a short RSI and 12-16 for long could be OK on 1h, because 6-8 hours is how long a session lasts. But if you're trading, say at 12 a.m. European time, what would a 6 RSI show - 3 hours of the beginning of European session and 3 hours of the late Asian session - what exactly is it showing? So it's not that easy. But if you stick to 4h, than 6 and 12 RSIs perfectly coincide with 1 day and 2 days.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I Know there might be a pullback on this one too but thats fine

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Dear Rajesh! I have to move to mt5 with my new brocker. Have you the same set of your beautiful MAs in color for mt5? or May I ask you about parameters MAType and MAApliedPrice for getting the same in a set of standard MA in mt5? Thank you for your work!

--- 帖子 #417 ---
There are (relatively) easy ways of converting an MT4 indicator into an MT5 indicator. Google knows how. This might be your best way forward.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hello Rajesh! How do you treat this kind of situations? When LT EMAs started to shrink, but then expand again. Do you wait for a new expansion of LT EMAs and new space to emerge between LT and ST EMAs? Or do you treat it as a continuation of the previous trend, which makes it possible to enter on usual rules (EMA channel, RSIs, Fibo).

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Agreed but for H1 chart, i suggest to add rsi 24 to 6 and 12. checkout on your charts. it might save few loosing trades. this is just a suggestion as i cant check it in my system.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
sorry. i dont have these in mt5 the long term guppy set is 30,35,40,45,50,55,60.....EMA applied to close the channel is 10 EMA set to high and low

--- 帖子 #421 ---
oohoo, the price action and the ema channel is too far from the LT group. the chances are the price will return back to LT group. so this is not a good setup to trade. the best trades are when price wicks or small candles come into or near the LT group ( pullback ) and then the candle closes beyond the ema channel (continuation pattern).

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I probably failed to explain it. In order to validate a proper trend, we need the separation that I have marked on the picture. Then comes contraction. Then EMAs start to re-expand, and price exits the 10-EMA channel. This is the rightmost end of my chart - my question is about this (I've marked on a new picture). At this point where I marked, Do you wait for a new expansion of LT EMAs and new space to emerge between LT and ST EMAs? Or do you treat it as a continuation of the previous trend, which makes it possible to enter on usual rules (EMA channel, RSIs, Fibo).

EURGBP - I think the ST hasn't separated enough from LT. EURJPY - agree that it is setting up.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I missed something: Some systems I read the first pullback is more useful, some others say not the first pullback to be in use. Guppy's idea is to use the 3rd pullback only? Thank you guys

--- 帖子 #431 ---
It's up to you which system you want to follow, and probably all are valid, although I don't recall Daryl Guppy saying to take the third pullback. The walvekar method advises using both the first and the second pullback/breakout patterns after a new trend has formed, with the first being the better one. I quote from his document: Once a new trend has been established, we wait for a pullback to the L/T EMAs and enter when price resumes in the trend direction and breaks out of the 10 EMA channel. We enter at the close of that candle. This would be the first pullback/breakout pattern in the new trend. We can also trade the second pullback/breakout pattern but from there the odds diminish so we do not trade until a new trend has formed. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
You got that dead right! EURGBP is only now looking like it is breaking the 10 EMA channel. But just look at EURJPY! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

dont count pullbacks. look at the bigger picture in higher timeframes. look at the strength of trend in current time frame. let me try to explain one of the instruments i have been successfully trading since many months. look at its daily chart. it is falling from sept 2021 till date for reasons i dont know. Attached Image (click to enlarge) on hourly time frame it has given me excellent opportunities and given me many profitable trades. look at the hourly chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) i have taken almost every trade at break of 10 ema low now look at yesterdays entry..... Attached Image (click to enlarge) almost all criteria of technical analysis fullfilled..... support.. support tested once... support broken.... support becomes resistance..... and our entry candle closing below 10 ema low. all gyppies very well saperated. after entry all candles closing outside 10 ema channel suggesting very strong down trend. today the market was so weak that i just closed my 2 positions at the end of the day.( no fibo targets) guppy is a trend trading system. if you find a strong trend, dont let it go. our entry rules are well defined, sl and targets depend on your trading mentality. Plan the trade and trade the plan

Some years ago when I was learning to speak Swahili, I proudly told a friend in the village that I had bought 7 chapatis. A short while later he arrived with 7 chapatis. Turns out I had used the future tense, not the past tense and he worked out that I must be asking him to buy some for me. I refunded him and gave him the extra chapatis to take back home. When we are learning anything like a new language it's not possible to use complex sentence structure or idioms and so forth. We're just not advanced in our usage at that stage. It's the same here. As an advanced user, walvekarraje knows when and how to bend the rules, but for us scrubbers, we have to draw by numbers and follow the dots, which is why we produced the walvekarraje trading method document - those are our rules. So for now you will need to keep an eye on what the rules say about pullbacks, but one day we will be able to do the advanced things that he described above with ease. And with the example walvekarraje has kindly provided, maybe give it a go and see what happens?

very well said Spudfan sir. i will suggest using strategy tester tool in MT4 to simulate charts and practice virtual trades. it is much better than manual backtesting. easy to document the pros and cons of any trading system. for those who dont know how to use strategy tester i will post a short tutorial in my next post

--- 帖子 #436 ---
steps for using strategy tester in MT4 1) click View Tab and open Strategy Tester/ Ctrl+R 2) select symbol and period 3) tick Use date and select any random dates you want. 4) tick Visual mode and select max speed on the slider. 5) Click Start your screen should look like this.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) to get the templete you want right click on the chart and select the templete you want. Attached Image (click to enlarge) once you get the templete click start again. your candles and indicators will start printing. Attached Image (click to enlarge) use the pause /play button in front of Visual mode as you wish. you can draw trendlines, fibos etc also in tester. H1 candle takes approx 1 to 2 min according to the indicators in your templete. only drawback is the multi time frame (MTF) indicators dont work in strategy tester.

Hi Guppy Traders, due to very high volatility in the market i am not trading futures. the chances of hitting SL on both sides is very very high in equities as well as indices. one more way of trading volatility using Guppy is as follows :- look at our chart of india volatility index (India VIX) Attached Image (click to enlarge) when the volatility index is more than 20 and Guppy LT group well spaced and daily candle close beyond 10 ema channel (candle marked with crosshair)..... this is the time to sell options because the time value is extremly high. the best is at the money strike price as it has the highest time value. in india we have weekly expiry for indiices (nifty and bank nifty). the best instrument to trade is the index as it is the most liquid of all instruments. if the trend is good or even side ways, the time value decayes rapidly. so 5 days a week trading if you sell at the money option according to our chart. it will become out of the money at the end of the week (Thursday). all out of the money options become worthless (zero) at the end of week. so such trades are extremly high probablity and passive trades. the profits though limited are certain. i have no idea if this can be applied in currency markets, but if it can be..... very high probablity very low risk ( no brainer, no screen time ) trades can be done.

Hello! I tried to adapt it to some other indexes but I'm afraid it's core is weekly expiry so I haven't seen a lot of profitable sells after big candles beyond 10maChannel

--- 帖子 #440 ---
i agree sir, that is why i have posted specific details in my post . last 2-3 weeks i am not trading futures but selling options( selling call options to be specific )...... because the markets are in downtrend and too volatile . voltility index is the key to decide what method of trading should be used. in one of my posts i have posted my strategy to buy equities in a very long term prespective. post 163 i am waiting for my signals to buy equities in cash.( timeframe D1) all future and otions trades are on guppy trend following system and 10 ema channel and H1 timeframe

I love this idea very much, backtested it visually and waiting to look at it in real time also I'm beaten lots of time in the past with intraday TFs Could you please tell me some of that future and options you trade for my visual backtest or maybe you could show some good trades pictures? Anyway, I thank you for the new breath in Guppy!

Sorry to be absent for a while. I've been busy with other things and also went across to using a short-term system of trading because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - these conditions do not suit a trend-following approach. So I have been in and out of the market the same day, nothing left running overnight or over weekends. It does seem that the markets are settling down a bit now but I'm still not comfortable with using a longer-term approach entirely yet. Perhaps next week I'll start looking at it.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
our family is celebrating my grandmothers 100th birthday. so did not trade this week. i have already posted many live future trades with logic of entry, stoploss and targets. will post again next week when i am back to trading. the logic of trading options is the same as futures. only sell At The Money option that has maximum time value. I will try to post few examples of that also.

Slowly getting back into it. Here's a trade on the AUDNZD H4 chart. The blue dotted line at the top is a long-term resistance level. Price is getting expensive up there and very likely won't go further, even if t makes it that far, so that's where I have placed my target. I have a trailing stop on the lower channel line.

How was calculated this SL? (Or is it already moved from initial?)

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I trade forex almost exclusively, and only the majors. Normally I start with my SL just a bit further away than the latest swing high/low. Sometimes that means that the SL is quite far away from my entry, but I try not to let it be more than about 75 pips (on H4 chart), usually less. I have an App that calculates my lot size based on the SL distance and the % risk I have chosen (e.g. 2% of balance). This means I don't mind having a large SL distance because with just a click or two the App tells me what lot size to use. This App has changed a lot for my trading. This also means that my trades all have a very similar amount of dollars risked. I have posted the .mq4 file here - it is from EarnForex who make some very good experts and indicators. https://www.earnforex.com/metatrader...ick-trade-pro/ . I have no connection with EarnForex. For this AUDNZD trade I placed my SL on the lower boundary of the 10 EMA channel, which is in line with the Walvekar method, so my amount risked was not much and therefore the App calculated a larger lot size than usual.

Yes, but very cautious about getting involved with the current global geo-politics as they are, but it will be a buy when I feel it's time. DAX 40 is a more tricky one - Germany is very close to a troubled region.

I entered this trade on the H4 chart yesterday, close to but not strictly according to the Walvekar method - I saw that pinbar in a good position and placed a sell stop entry a bit below the nose. It's the pinbar 7 candles back from present, with its tail crossing into the L/T EMAs. The daily L/T EMA boundary lines (30 EMA and 60 EMA, respectively) are shown using dotted lines - we are clearly in a downtrend. The weekly chart shows that this might be good for a long-term trade.

Here's a view of the indicator I have been waiting for. It comes with a risk warning! I haven't tested it yet, having received it today, but I have been thinking about it for a long time. I should also say that I am not planning to promote this and I don't want to distract from what we have been doing for the last few months. It is only partly based on the Walvekar method in that it borrows from it (it monitors the 10 EMA channel and the 30 EMA and 60 EMA of the long-term Guppy lines). But it is totally different in that it is aggressive in its approach, signalling a trading opportunity the moment all four of those lines are in agreement (i.e. the colours are all blue/green or all red magenta) [EDIT: It also waits for price to break out - see next para]. It does not wait for any further confirmation. Hence the risk warning. For an alert to be produced, price must also have closed above/below all four lines. This latter feature made the coding easier and most of the time ends up being the same thing as price closing beyond the channel, so it's very close to the Walvekar method in that respect. This chart shows examples of where it is difficult (where the vertical lines are close to each other) and where it is very profitable - the massive uptrend after the last blue vertical line - it's up to the trader to figure out how to avoid the one and maximise the other Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Guys. Joined FF for the first time because of this thread in general and specifically because of Spudfan and Rajesh to learn more in detail. But both seem to have taken a big break. Awaiting for both to return and continue their amazing knowledge. TIA

--- 帖子 #467 ---
That's very kind, but, speaking for myself, it feels as if I'm as much in the dark as anyone else! My trading style remains firmly with using MAs (of various types and styles, including the GMMAs and variations of that). I also very much like to close all trades by the end of my day. If I can I will place a "basket" of trades earlier in my day and hope for them to reach profit as a collective. When the basket gets to around 1.5% growth on balance (or better) by the end of the London/New York overlap, I will then close all of them regardless of how much profit individual trades have made, given that the basket is worth something decent. This Monday gave me 3.44% in that way, but that doesn't happen often. Then I'm back in the dark wondering what's going on. You'll notice that I posted recently about a new indicator I had made. It works nicely when placed onto the GMMAs. I also played around with the PSAR indicator and Erebus's 4-bar indicator to see if I could get some edge with any of those. I realised that in fact, simple price action using just the GMMAs (and I added the 120 EMA) was probably as good as it gets. I'll prepare a post on that so you can see what I have been doing.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
welcome sagar, welcome to this forum. this is your first post. i am using this system since more than 2 years with decent gains. all the rules are very well documented. we have taken a break as there is nothing more to add to. but any inputs or querries from you are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Thanks a lot for both of you. As a newbie, each of my posts get moderated. So not sure, the time difference between my question / doubts and your answers. 1. As both of you trade intra day specifically, what TF do you actually trade? 2. Is there a specific way to shortlist a particular pair to trade on a particular day, like ADR, no news pair, etc? 3. Today for example, GJ rallied about 330 pips but going by GMMA, rules, not a single entry was possible. Same with EJ and AJ also. 4. I have read lots of times to trade towards HTF. Going by that rule again, no trades in GJ or EJ or AJ, though they moved almost 800 pips combined. How to decide? More questions to follow. TIA

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Thank you, nice trade!

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Here's a chart to give some idea of simple price action as represented in the GMMAs. Whatever else I might use, these characteristics will always show themselves. And to answer your question, I use H4. Please note that I am not in competition with the Walvekar method. It's a good and robust approach. Starting on 10 March on my chart you will even see the typical new trend / pullback / breakout sequence. If it's there, read it and use it. Back to the GMMAs - when the red, blue and yellow lines separate, trade that trend. But when they converge and get mixed up, don't trade, except to note that when those lines are close to each other they represent a period of consolidation (the first one-third of my chart). Earlier in this thread I called that a pinch. It still is a predictor of a potentially powerful move out of that zone. It really is something to watch out for. But for normal trading each day, watch out for small pullbacks to the EMAs and trade those. These small pulbacks are not big, e.g. an inside bar set up or a two- or three-bar pullback. I use a stop order, not a limit order so that if price continues further towards the EMAs and does a "refresh" or crosses over and reverses, my order gets left behind with no damage done. And for as long as the EMAs remain separated, but before they start bellying away from each other, just keep on trading that trend. I use a PSAR trailing stop EA set on 0.015 and 0.2. This helps to squeeze out the most I can from a longer move. Power moves (explosive candles or even multiple same-colour candles) usually lead to an overbought/sold condition, which the GMMAs represent well. These conditions usually lead to larger pullbacks (sometimes called a "refresh"), or even a reversal. So whenever a power move has occurred, be cautious or close your trade if you have one running. In a nutshell, that's it. The 4-bar indicator I referred to in my previous post is still of interest. I am having it tweaked and will share it another time. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks a lot Spudfan. As you suggested few pages ago, I got 2 different window, 1 with typical GMMA set up (with TDI), 2nd with Rajesh set up with 10 ema channel and RSI 6 and 12. My issues start with RSI. Im scanning GJ, EJ, AJ, GU, EU, AU and gold. When i have to consider GMMA rules and RSI rules, I can not see a single set up in any of these pairs. I want to trade either 15m or 1h intra day or 4h swing trades. If you go through GJ / EJ / AJ chart today, you will understand my predicament. Any help will surely be appreciated. Regards,

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Notes as marked on chart. Now the red, blue and yellow lines are starting to mix together. No trade until things sort themselves out. I have no idea which way this will go from this although, judging by the daily chart, it might go bullish, i.e. a bullish reversal on the daily. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Spudfan, your charts are so neat and uncluttered. Respect. You do not seem to use either rsi or tdi or stoch. How do you valuate over bought and over sold zones? Both for entries and exits? If you use only 4h trades, how do you close trades when London and NY overlap or might be by London close? Are your entries by 1 hour after Tokyo open? That will be my second 4h candle open. TIA

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Spudfan, need your comments on this, today GJ

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I would be interested to know by what rules you decided there was no trade on the first of those opportunities you marked? If using just the GMMA approach, you had a long period of very tight consolidation and a big breakout. The consolidation would have been a sign to watch for the breakout. So as soon as you saw the lines beginning to diverge and show open space between them you could have entered. If you were quick, or lucky, you could have got in on those small bars before the big move up. If you notice, they represent a short pullback towards the EMAs before the explosive move up. If you had missed the early entry, you could have waited for the almost inevitable correction / pullback after it and got in on one of those smaller bars. Entering at the end of a large or explosive bar is not usually a good idea because of such a corrective pullback.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thank you. I do prefer a simple and uncluttered approach, so whenever I play around with various indicators usually I migrate back to clean and simple, eventually. I stopped using RSI and stochs for this purpose a long time ago. They just didn't work well for me. Overbought/sold is when price looks stretched away from the EMAs. which is usually after a power move of some sort has taken place. Price then moves ahead of the EMAs, which are lagging indicators and then the alarm bells start ringing. This chart (EURUSD H4) is an example - I know price tends to continue in the direction it has been moving, but right now I would not enter. Scroll down to the daily chart - that's a real power move - correction surely around the corner. And if it doesn't correct and I miss the continued down move, so be it.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Yes, I close my trades at the London close, if things have worked out that way. Often not. My time zone is UTC+2. So (ignoring daylight saving in the northern hemisphere), the third candle of the day opens at my 08:00, which is 06:00 in London. So I start trading at my 08:00 but it's better to wait for two hours and a bit and get in when the London session opens. But trades I place at that time often sit around doing nothing for a few hours and only really get moving a while before or at my 15:00, which is the NY open. The London session overlaps with the NY session for a further 4 hours and ends at my 19:00. If I could find a way of sitting on my hands until 15:00 my time, it would probably improve my trading, but that level of discipline is beyond me!

Here's another trade I'm in, notes on chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Thanks buddy. Reasons for not entering rally was rsi, it sat on 80 right through the rally. GMMA rules did not permit to enter sell off / retracement. No cross over, candles were right inside LT guppies. Correct where am I wrong? TIA

--- 帖子 #483 ---
this is a good chart to trade. its a healthy uptrend with retracement to LT guppy. i would wait for rsi crossover and both to go above 50 (change color to lime) and candle to close above all short term guppys (as you are not using 10 ema channel) to go long. may i suggest you use ma in color indicator to chart your guppys. just by change in color makes it a leading indicator signifying change in trend.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
i personally find rsi very reliable indicator to make decisions. 1) long only if both rsi &gt; 50, short if &lt; 50 2) 60 to 80 is strong uptrend , 40 to 20 is strong downtrend. remain tn the trade in these levels. 3) above 80 or below 20 is extreme over bought or over sold levels. trail your stoploss to previous candle high/ low

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Spudfan, You are right. Without rsi / tdi, I should have entered, where I drew line. Big issue of entry is solved well and truly. But where to exit? pips? zone? Rajesh, your inputs please, on rsi usage also. TIA

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Thanks Rajesh, I posted without reading this post. How do i change the color of ma or where do i find that indi? And in that GJ trade, rsi sat on 80 level, throughout the rally. How do I enter and where? As much as I do not want you or Spudfan to spoon feed me, Im looking at your thought process. TIA

Rajesh, Im using to 10 ema channel in another window with TDI. Observe how even TDI sat in over bought zone. If I take tdi out, i know i could have drivel ema 10 channel up. The question again is exit, if I do it. Regards,

--- 帖子 #489 ---
1) rsi has to cross 50 level when the rally started. that is the candle you have to identify in real time. 2) if rsi is &gt; 80 throughout the rally you trail your stoploss to previous candle low.

sorry sagar. i have no experience using tdi

Rajesh, Will surely re read all your posts again and ask if needs arise. How do you select an asset / instrument to trade. 1. Average daily range, say over 10-20 days? 2. Yesterday volume? 3. News events scheduled? 4. Yesterday open and close? Spudfan, Your inputs help more as you trade FX exclusively. TIA

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Sagar, this is The Source . It has been posted previously in this thread but here it is for your convenience.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
If you don't receive the gift of a basket of trades that you can treat as a collective, as I hope for every day, then each trade needs to be managed individually. Exiting is actually one of the more difficult parts of trading because there's no magic formula. Rajesh has a clearly worked out strategy, so have a look at that in the source document. It's a good strategy, it's not perfect (perfect doesn't exist), but it works and it's clearly formulated. That's about as good as it gets. My approach is to set an ambitious but still realistic fixed target and then to trail the stop. "Ambitious" is a number at the larger end of, or a bit beyond, what most trailed stops will achieve. Have a look at the PSAR dots - they make it easy to figure out what a "standard" trade looks lke using that trailing stop method. If I'm lucky, price will reach that target, and if not, the trailing stop will still bring in something. The problem with a trailing stop is that price usually goes much further than the trailed stop and then retraces, so you exit with much less profit than price actually reached. My AUDCAD trade that I posted about yesterday reached 90 pips but has since been retracing. I kind of "knew" I should close at 90 pips, but had previously decided to let it run and see what happens. Well, what is happening is that the stop is currently sitting at 19 pips in profit. In three hours' time it will be moved down to about 26 pips, which is more or less where I expect it to be stopped out. Another idea for you is to go for easily achievable fixed targets with some of your trades and then choose one to trail for as far as it will go. In this way I banked about 1.7% profit on two trades yesterday and left AUDCAD to run. NZDCHF, which I placed later, has just been stopped out for a 14 pip loss. Hope this helps.

Stopped out at my trailed stop for 58 pips. The entry and close are marked on the chart. On Friday I changed the PSAR Max setting to 0.1, which means it doesn't track price movements quite as closely.

I finally cracked a decent breakout trade. Earlier in the year I was going on about the "pinch", where all the EMAs come together closely in a tight consolidation. Most of the time the breakouts happen so fast I miss them. This time I noticed such a setup on GBPJPY and placed a sell stop order below. And a short while later this happened. SL is at breakeven, TP at 190 pips - a nice one if it gets all the way there. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

sir, 1) guppy system has to be traded with one oscillator. rsi is my choice. i had to struggle a lot to get rsi settings right. 2) breakout, pullback, continuation pattern is the best way to trade guppy..... after a breakout a pullback near 50% fibo is a good entry point. 3) continuation entry as near as LT guppy is a high probablity winning trade. 4) the LT guppy is the decision making indicator. they have to be spaced correctly for your entry. entry has to be as near the LT guppy. i dont mean any disrespect

--- 帖子 #506 ---
No offence taken! All people are different and we find different ways of trading that suit us. My preference is for clean charts without any or with very few indicators, apart from the Guppy GMMAs themselves. I have found every time I start playing with other indicators that I get distracted and start making mistakes. That is why I have gone back to using "pure" GMMAs. That just seems to work better for me. Something else is that you trade options and futures - I confess I have very little idea of what those are or how they work! I trade forex pairs almost exclusively which, I think, work quite differently from options and futures, also indices, which I am beginning to gain some experience with. My comment about there being an art to it was in reference to breakouts from a tight consolidation area (what I have previously called a "pinch"). I have missed many of these very promising breakouts and so, when I succeeded in catching the GBPJPY breakout today I was very happy! But I then messed up the EURJPY trade, so yes, it seems there is an art to catching breakouts and I want to figure out what I did wrong with that one.

1) No offence taken! thanks sir. 2) "That just seems to work better for me" agreed 3) "it seems there is an art to catching breakouts and I want to figure out what I did wrong with that one" here i disagree. guppy system is not catching breakouts. its a breakout pullback continuation pattern. guppy relies on LT group as the treand and ST group gives you the entry. this is what i am doing successfully. 4) trading breakouts is not guppy multiple moving averages trend following system . please refer to my posts 278 and 279 and post 280...your reply to my comments. once again : i dont mean any disrespect

Hi Spudfan and Rajesh and other roomies, Though I'm a newbie at FF, im not newbie to fx trading as such. It is just that as all of us do, I'm also trying to find an easier to understand and implement method, days after days, weeks after weeks to years after year. After stumbling on this thread and my interaction with Spudfan and Rajesh, about 10 days ago, I did lot of studies not just on GMMA, but also on rainbow trading. One thing common in all GMMA and rainbow threads / posts, is both entry and exits are individualistic and subjective. Being a pro trader and living off trading, I can not allow my trading life to be subjective. I prefer it to be more objective and precise. To this effect, I find Rajesh's strategy to be more rules based and definite than subjective. 1. I fine tuned Rajesh's rules to suit my trading style. I prefer TDI than RSI ONLY because I'm already used to TDI since 3 years and know the flow. 2. I trade from second 4h candle close, 10.30 IST, 5 hours into Tokyo till London close, 21.30 IST. That is 11 hours trading window. 3. I will wait for either Bullish / Bearish rotation or Rejection, on 4h or / and 1h, 30 ema and 60 ema cross over. 4. After the rotation / rejection, trade in shorter TF to catch more pips. Trade 15m on rotation in 1h and trade 1h and 15m after 4h rotation. 5. I exit trade/s on, either ADR being reached or TDI in OB / OS in 1 higher TF than TTF. 6. Today being NFP, i'm on sidelines today, will update from Monday. Welcome any and all advices. TIA

--- 帖子 #510 ---
My mistake, Rajesh. I used the word "pure" as in chart appearance, not purity of method. Perhaps "uncluttered" would have been a better choice of word. So, to be clear, I prefer uncluttered charts and I have found on many occasions that when I start experimenting with other indicators I get distracted and start making mistakes. As for breakouts, I can't recall whether Guppy refers to them, but "pinches" do exist and so do breakouts from those pinched areas. If Guppy missed that it's his bad, not mine

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Spudfan, I don't know if you or other roomies remember. You had posted few charts LT guppies above / below 200 ema. That alone is a big game changer is someone follows it religiously. Thanks for that eye opener

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Would that be post #149? Here's the annotated image from that post with rules. Perhaps I should go back to that! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Sagar, your reminder of that post is very interesting. It seems I have come back that that instinctively without realising it. The only difference is that the MA I have added to the standard GMMAs is 120 EMA, not 200. I found then that waiting for a "pinch" that included the 200 EMA took a long time. Somehow I have evolved to a slightly quicker version without any reference to that original. Here's an example where the EMAs are close together. Following the rules posted in #149, we need to wait a bit for the EMAs to align themselves correctly. It's looking bullish (HHs, HLs). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #514 ---
True. And you have also been dead right, when you said results are better when we keep it simple. I normally trade, intra day on 1h or 4h swing trades. These trade are good in a trending market but not great in choppy / less volume markets. I was searching ways to over come this and luckily fell upon a scalping thread by Linuxtroll who exclusively scalps using rainbow system. Today being NFP, i'm trying his method on Rajesh entry rules, albeit, take trend on 15m and trade on 1m and 5m. Results are awesome to be modest. Just 5 pips target over and above the spread, 6 trades on EJ and AU till now, all hit target, 30 pips on a low volume day. Have to add scalping as an armor. battle ready is half battle won. Cheers

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I'm trying to catch what might be a breakout - in early and waiting for a big move that is still (hopefully) on its way. A problem with going long here is that this bullish move started a long way down (about 1300 pips ago on 7 March - see second chart, a zoomed out version), and as trends don't continue forever, perhaps I am pushing my luck here.

Stopped out at break-even. But it did get to 55 pips up initially. Entering trades after a trend change and once the GMMAs have settled into their places remains the ideal.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Spudfan, Just for your own reasons, I'm waiting for sell set up, on both EJ &amp; GJ. As far as im concerned, market does not have enough momentum to trade 4h swing trades or D positional trades. That is why, Im scalping more since 3 weeks. Take trend on 1h and trade on 15m and 5m towards 1h trend, smaller but regular profits. Small water drops make a mighty ocean, kind. My 2 cents though.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
took trade yesterday during market close Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) booked 50 % profit @ T1 waiting for T2. SL at break even.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) T2 hit. booked 100% profit

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) the importance of fibo targets cannot be overstressed. after hitting T2 to the pip, price retraced well beyond T1 at market close. if i had not booked at T2, my profit would have been significantly less. second important point is to trail SL at previous candle high/low if Rsi 6 goes below 20/80.... so if my T2 would not have triggred, by trailing SL to previous candle high, i would have retained significant part of my profit.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hello Sagar: I agree with your view on scalping. I only look at the eur/usd, gbp/usd or the usd/jpy before and during the NY open. Are you using D. Guppy's original settings, ema and not sma or wma. Or do you use Hull's settings? So many suggestions here in Forex Factory threads but I think I will settle on using Guppys as he has the experience with MMAs. I would appreciate your comments.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi pip, I do use Guppy's LT ema's not sma or wma. But I don't use short term ema's as Rajesh pointed out, they dont serve too much of a purpose. I'm using 10 ema channel, instead of ST Guppy ema's. I follow TDI to know OB / OS zones, but it should be OB / OS in 1 higher tf above my trading TF. For buy trades, Candles should close above 10 ema channel, 10 ema channel above LT ema's and TDI should be above 50 level and opposite true for sell trades. Due to lesser volume, I'm only scalping since last monday, 8 trading days. I trade from 2nd hour of Tokyo, 2nd 4h candle open till London Close. I target 3 pips on 1m, 5 pips on 5m or 10 pips on 15m. I been making 80-100 pip, every trading day. I scan EU, GU, AU, GJ, EJ, AJ, CadJ and ChfJ. Im predominantly trading Yen pairs now, as Yen has weakened a lot since 2 months and its high time Yen strengthens. Investors never want a weak Yen as Yen is a safe heaven currency. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Thank you

Unfortunately TDAmeritrade does not have the TDI indicator. I wonder if RSI with a level of 50 would accomplish about the same thing. Anyone care to comment or suggest is very welcomed.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Pip, TDI / RSI / Stoch, anything and everything will work. You should get used to the ebb / flow. That matters. But in my experience, in TDI, I can tell you 2 things. Whenever price / market moves fast and furious (Yen pairs yesterday for example), every oscillator reaches OB / OS very soon, which will not be the case if the same movement (distance) happens over time. Second, always observe OB / OS in 1 higher TF than your actual trading TF. This becomes most important, when you scalp in shorter TF. Otherwise, you will be badly caught in smaller TF whipsaws. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #526 ---
One post that made my grey cells wake up and run full throttle about scalping. I'm glad my grey cells did so. 9 trading days, from last monday, lowest pips 80 and highest 190 pips yesterday. Observe trend on 1h and trade towards that on 15m and 5m, trend on 15m, trade on 5m and 1m. Cheers

--- 帖子 #527 ---
My entry rules, in the same order, always. 1. Observe price action, candlestick pattern/s. 2. Observe Present Price with regards to 10 ema channel and Guppy LT ema's 3. Observe TDI 4. Pull the trigger 5. Target - either ATR*2 (on trading TF) or hard target, 3 pips on 1m, 5 pips on 5m and 10 pips on 15m, 3/5/15 over and above the spread. "WHAT DO I SEE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN, WHAT DO I DO?" Cheers

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Great posts,Sagar, and thank you.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Thank you for this, Sagar. Regarding looking at the TDI on 1 higher TF, is there a way of changing the settings on the current TF to make it mirror what it would be doing on the HTF? From H4 to D1 I have tried simply multiplying the relevant settings by 6, but it doesn't seem to work as expected.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Spudfan, There are few traders, using MTF TDI. But it kind of jumbled up my charts. Just like you, I prefer neat and simple charts, highlighting all important candlesticks. Anyway, it won't take more than a second to check higher TF TDI, we won't loose much time. You can find all TDI related Indi's in the original TDI thread, Trading made simple by Big E. There are different versions of TDI itself. I use the TDI, advised by original Big E. More importantly, I do top down analysis on every weekends, so generally I know, where PA and TDI, is on HTF. My bias is Bullish on Yen (Bearish on EJ, GJ, AJ, CadJ and ChfJ) and GU, EU and AU as GU, EU and AU are OS even on weekly TF and kind of reversal started on last 4h candle close on Friday. So, I know the nearest upside KPL is too far away for me to rely only on TDI for OB levels. Same is true for Yen on OS levels. This top down / predictive analysis on each weekends, greatly reduces my time and efforts on trading days. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
This post is off the topic of GMMA, but I thought it might help someone. In 1 of his posts, Rajesh spoke about how he uses GMMA to build up his portfolio. That post made me think up little bigger and wiser also. It is simple human psychology that we tend to spend whatever income we get in hand. To negate this spend-thrift attitude, I opened a kind of Savings account. I opened 1 more trading account with my broker. My primary trading account takes care of all our family expenses and few more as well. Since last Monday, when I opened the Savings account, I transfer 30% of the closed trade's profit, at the end of the day, to Savings account. Every trading account should earn, not be idle. So, Whereas, I risk 2% on each trade in my Primary account, I risk only .5% in Savings account. The main difference between the two accounts is, whereas I withdraw every weekend from my Primary Account, for our family expenses, idea is to withdraw ONLY 50% of the profit from Savings Account, ONLY at year end, making it grow, SLOW AND STEADY over Long Long time. And this little brother Savings Account, keeps getting pocket money regularly from Big Brother, Primary Account. Hope it helps someone. Cheers

i agree. but the default settings dont work. you need to play with the settings, corelate with your guppy chart and backtest. all oscillators will give correct signals if the settings are right. for me to go with guppy LT AND 10 ema channel, rsi 6/12 crossover and both 50 cross is ideal. similarly you need to play and adjust the tdi settings. those who use MACD, 6,50,9 is ideal to go with guppy and 10 ema entry. i am using this also along with rsi to prevent false breakouts. rather than a clean chart, i do like indicators that help me to enter a strong trend and make money. thats all we care as traders i suppose

--- 帖子 #534 ---
let me give you examples. i consider 20/80 rsi 6 as oversold and overbought levels. on thursday at 10 min to market colse i went long on nifty which is in a very strong downtrend on guppy but rsi 6 was well below 20. friday morning nifty opened gapup and i got 140 points within first 5 min of trade. after words nifty again went down and almost touched previous day low. but i earned on a counter trend entry and my day was made. i see that you trade on 1 min charts. sometimes i also. but my rsi settings are 60/90 crossover ( fixed minimum 40, fixed maximum 60) and i use ema 240 with our standard guppy LT group. my entries are 60/90 cross eachother and both cross 50 at the same time price crosses ema 240. just try, it might help.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Rajesh, Trend is real important in trading, but problem, the way i see it, is Trend word is thrown around in most of the threads like a freebie. Trend becomes irrelevant without being specific to TF. There was a guy, who was talking about trading 1m towards weekly trend. That poor guy never realized that tremendous amount of PA happens in weekly compared to 1m movement. I look at D, only if I'm trading 4h swing or 1h intra day trades. For all my scalping trades, I only look at 1h trend, not beyond. and more importantly, I'm scalping since 3/4 weeks as market was not moving much to look for 4h swing or D positional trades. I trade to earn, TF's are irrelevant for me. Same it true with any oscillator/s. Many traders consider OB / OS as reversal even in 1m, 5m and 15m. For me, OB / OS in shorter TF is strong indication of trend continuing in the same direction. Only when TDI reaches OB / OS in 4h and above, I start looking deeper. Again, TDI is only to confirm, PA is primary for me. I manually draw KPL's on D and 4h TF's. When price reaches those levels, I will be keenly interested in PASR. WHAT DO I SEE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN, WHAT DO I DO is my Mantra. Cheers.

I've been a bit quiet in recent days, but have been lurking quietly in the background following the interesting conversations that Sagar has introduced. First, a comment to Sagar - it's amazing that you have built up not only your primary account sufficient to live off, but that you now have a "savings" account that you are building up. Most of us are still working on our primary account and dreaming of the day it has built up sufficiently to live off, so well done to you. Then, you made a comment about using TDI and it sparked a memory for me of Big E's thread (Trading Made Simple) in its early days and before it got hijacked by others, one in particular. So, in spite of my saying I prefer a simple chart and that I get distracted by indicators, I've been spending recent days working with bits and pieces from Big E's thread and from this thread and have come up with something that is looking promising. It uses Rajesh's 10 EMA channel, Big E's "5-method" and the TDI. I've been backtesting it carefully over the weekend and feel optimistic. It does not belong in this thread, so I'll leave it at that, but I might even open a "savings account" of my own one of these days

--- 帖子 #540 ---
You are so very right about ONE hijacking Big E thread, shamelessly. I stopped reading the thread soon after Big E left for heaven and there was nothing left to learn as well. I'm kind of old school, does not believe in back testing, but rely more on live environment. I have a 100$ account (trade .01, micro lot only), on which I test all new indi / strategy that I might be interested in. Back testing does not involve all important EMOTIONS, which plays big part in all trading related decisions. As far as this thread is concerned (being off track the main concept), this thread was dead, if not for you and Rajesh. That way, I trust, we can continue discussing here, irrespective of different Ind's that we might add as GMMA is still part of our strategy. I do have LT Guppy though I use 10 ema channel. Cheers

--- 帖子 #541 ---
sagar, will you be kind and attach some of your charts with entry and exits points and use of tdi. i have no experience with tdi and am eager to learn

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Sure Rajesh. My 1st trade on every Monday is after Frankfurt open as, in my experience, its just weekend effects / whipsaws and wicks before that. Last trade by 4 hours into London on Friday (and close by London close), as I do not wish to carry forward any trades into weekends. I trust in having positive balance sheet at the weekend, not necessarily all trades to be closed in positive. To be precise, I might have made about 600$ profit by Friday evening and have about 55$ in running loss. By London close I will close this trade and live weekend peacefully (545$ net profit) rather than having an open trade and losing whole weekend with family. Cheers

took a bubble burst trade today. look at this chart of Voltas daily chart shows sudden fall in price after a consolidation. fall is sudden, sharp, in very short time. the price has moved far away from LT GUPPYS also from 10 ema channel. rsi 6 has gone way below 20 during the price fall and today ( last bullish candle) it has crossed 20 fron below up, also crossed rsi 12. the MACD has formed a hook. Attached Image (click to enlarge) now on H1 chart where i entered the trade at the close of the candle...1) close above 10 ema channel. 2) channel is blue in color confirming uptrend. 3) both rsi are above 50 and rsi6&gt; rsi12. 4) macd cross below 0 much earlier signifying uprtend.

I have worked out what I was attempting here and I have an analogy for it. A ladder has side rails and rungs or steps. It doesn't work if either of these are missing. The GMMAs are like the side rails - very useful for identifying a trend and the reliability of that trend as it progresses. But, as already discussed earlier in this thread, Daryl Guppy did not give any guidance on the specifics of entering or exiting trades. The Walkvekar method is an excellent solution to this. It adds the rungs to some very good side rails. My little diversion was to remove the side rails and see how the rungs work on their own. Not very well, although I was lucky and lost only about 47 pips on Monday. I soon saw the folly of what I was doing (and the difficulty of doing it that way) and re-introduced the GMMAs. On Tuesday I went back into profit and today is looking moderately good so far. Will keep you posted, but at least what I am doing belongs in this thread again.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I have observed that you predominantly trade 4h. Try and add scalping to your Armory. You will be surprised to know how consistently you can keep banking 10 pips / trade. Grows the account balance. Cheers

--- 帖子 #551 ---
That's better. I have just closed all my trades for the day and came out with close to 3% growth on balance. I'm using GMMAs for trend, Big E's 5 EMA (Shift 3, Typical Price) for trade signals in conjunction with the TDI indicator (which I have noticed is very close to the RSI 12/6). I also have the 10 EMA channel on my chart because it is useful to indicate whether price is moving or not depending whether it is mainly inside the channel or outside. The main difference with the Walvekar method is that I don't wait for a pullback - just go for it any time the GMMAs show a trend is in place and the 5 EMA (3,3) gives a signal, as long as price action allows it. But otherwise it's all along similar lines.

Why do traders loose money? Why do I do Predictive / Top down Analysis on every weekend? Why these 2 questions at the same time? I will try and explain my experience. Why do trades loose money, when market does ONLY three things? Rallies up, Sells off and consolidates. Compare these just 3 parameters to an aircraft cockpit instruments. Ask our resident doctor Rajesh on how many complex instruments they use and what all, how fast and accurate they have to analyse to save a life. But still, having to observe only 3 parameters, majority of traders loose. WHY? In my experience, traders loose because they cannot decide / judge either to be a buyer or a seller or to be on sidelines. They are in confusion as there is no home work or class work done in the holidays (weekend’s) for the exam on trading days. And confusion is not good for any trader. Absolute clarity of thoughts and actions needed to make consistent profits in the market. Someone might ask how the predictive analysis solves this dilemma / enigma. After I do predictive analysis for all the pairs that I scan, I decide my bias for the whole week. For each pair, I decide either to be a buyer or seller or be on the sidelines for the whole trading week. Thereby, I’m eliminating the biggest confusion / chaos. Once I decide my bias, I invalidate all opposite trading signals and trade only those set up’s that support my bias. For an example, my bias for EU / GU and AU for this week is to be a buyer only. So, whenever I saw buy signals, right from 5m to 1h, I was on buying spree. Whenever market offered a sell signals in these pairs, I invalidated / ignored all those signals. Someone might say, I might loose number of trades and pips. What big deal? I’m not sprinting 100 metres for an Olympic gold at all. We are all slaves of our habits. Good plans, actions and efforts instil good habits. Opposite is true for bad plans, actions and efforts. In a 7 trillion $, 24/5 market, we can only be early in the market, never ever late. That being the case why be trigger happy and loose? By losing consistently, it affects wrong side of our mental equilibrium. Whenever I get a trade-able set up, I do not trade very next candle after the so called mother / trigger candle. I wait for one more candle to close in the same direction to make sure, it is a proper trade-able set up, not a fake signal. My 1st trade on every Monday is after London opens as in my experience, it is just weekend effects / whipsaws / wicks. My last trade on every Friday is 3 hours into London, not later. I trust in positive weekly balance sheet, not necessarily all positive trades. I close all the open trades by London close on Friday and spend weekend time with family. I trade for my family you see. I do not trade a pair which has moved equal to ADR or more. I do not trade a pair which has moved more than 200% of ADR previous day, as it will just consolidates next day. I trade only 1 pair at any time for better trade management. I plan my trades and stick very religiously with my trade plans. Hope, this lengthy post helps someone. Cheers.

How does this look? It's on the daily so a fairly long-term breakout might be happening next week. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #558 ---
I go to D and zoom out till I can see about 2/3 years history ONLY, reason being I'm not interested in what PA did decades ago. Recent PA is more important to analyze present PA. I go beyond only when D does not give you any clarity or it is beyond MT4 terminal, as the case now with GU / EU and EU. Observe the relation of PPA with TDI oscillator. I'm not that keen on TSL (traders signal line) in TDI, only Oscillator in TDI. I might again go beyond D if oscillator is way above / below 80/20 levels. I have added 80 and 20 levels for my personal comfort, though initial TDI settings were 68 and 32. On D, I draw lines on KPL's. I'm always more interested in those zones, which have been both R and S in recent past. I do same exercise on 4h also. and I will be more keen on those lines which appear both in D and 4h as they represent strongest KPL zones. Only 15 days ago, I added LT Guppy, can not comment yet on how I might use them. But general idea is to use how you use. I posted, why I'm bullish on GU, along with charts, 3/4 days ago. But in general, these are my entry rules in same priority order. 1. Observe PA / Candlestick patterns. 2. Observe how far / near is next KPL and 200 EMA. I use 200 ema only in 4h and D, unlike those who use it even in smaller TF's. 3. Observe TDI oscillator, again only in 4h and above. I do not use TDI signals to enter a trade in TTF. 4. Pull the trigger. 5. Target can be, ATR7*2 / 50% of ADR, next KPL, if trade is scalp / intra day or positional etc. 6. I use global equity SL not individual trade stops. Hope it helps. Feel free if you need more info. Cheers

I've spent the last hour reading through your post and seeing how it relates to the charts. Very useful, thank you. I also tried to correlate it with what I am more familiar with. This chart refers. It is a daily chart, which is the TF where you do your homework over the weekend. I have identified a buy-only area as revealed by the GMMAs. So to follow your example, but using the Guppy approach, I should move up to the daily TFs on all my charts and look for such a breakout and trend establishment, and use that to set my bias for the week and probably beyond in most cases. It's a matter of being patient and waiting for these lovely trends, not chasing them. And they do appear all over the place. I have also attached two scripts that I have found very useful - moving up or down TFs is quick and easy with the SyncTimeFrames one and the other allows me to apply a template to all charts.

Can i advise 1 more small home work? Remove LT EMA's also, plant line charts (they won't have wicks), draw KPL's. Trend will be clearly visible with KPL's, decision making will be easier as well. With your experience, you should also know, every MA, including Guppy EMA's are PA driven not other way oriented. Draw KPL's, observe candlestick patterns supporting your bull / bear bias, towards next KPL and then take Guppy and TDI help as a support. Be fluid in your defined boundaries. Cheers

Few general rules that I follow. 1. Trade only when at least 1 exchange of a pair is open. Otherwise, pair will not have enough liquidity / volume in the market. For example, how can we expect, say, USDCAD to have any liquidity during Tokyo, when both US and Canada exchanges are not working. Go through history of any pair, you will realize what I’m talking about. 2. Do not trade any pair, which has red news, due in less than 6-8 hours, do not be on the road, when weatherman forecasts a thunderstorm. 3. DO NOT TRADE AGAINST MY BIAS, God will not respect our prayers / wishes / hopes, after we trade as he has already blessed us to think before we trade. 4. Find minimum 3 reasons / rules to enter a trade, more rules and reasons, stronger will be the trade, disaster if less than 3 reasons. 5. Define the risk/s, let the market decide the reward. 6. Number of pips is always over emphasized. Always think in terms of USD, green buck always smells sexy. 7. Run from any trader / expert, who uses “I Think / feel” in his trading dictionary. 7 trillion $ market does not dance to their tunes. Simplest Mantra is “WHAT DO I SEE, WHAT DOES IT MEAN, And WHAT DO I DO?” 8. Trading is all about AAA, Accept a Trade-able set up, Analyze the Risk and Act (trade or wait). 9. Planning to win each and every trade puts enormous pressure on our Psyche and pressure is never great for a trader. Think about positive balance sheet at weekend and month end, month after month. 10. Do not ever hear / read what others talk about any pair, their bias will influence our own bias / analysis. Shakira is wrong. Hips might lie, CHARTS DO NOT LIE. 11. Live as if you die next minute, but LEARN AS IF YOU LIVE FOREVER. 12. More, when I can think of jolting down. Cheers

I have noticed that many of the NZD and AUS pairs appear to be bottoming and might be turning. The GMMAs have not realigned yet so on most of them I have the word WAIT in large letters reminding me not to get too excited! In this example I am expecting a correction and will wait for that before I consider entering this market. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dear Spudfan, If China sneezes, Aussie and Kiwi get cold flu as they have biggest export exposure to China. With so much (worse) happening in China, cities getting locked down, unemployment climbing up, exports getting hit, gdp coming down, Xi Ping fighting to hold on to power, QUAD meet (China being a big topic of discussion) right now, my sincere advice is to (just like you, in capital) STAY AWAY FROM AUSSIE AND KIWI. My 2 cents though. Cheers

When I went on my "little diversion" last Monday, trying to trade using signals only without the trend guidance provided by the GMMAs, it taught me a useful lesson. Since then I have played it cautiously, waiting until the GMMAs were aligned and a trend was properly in place. In the six trading days since then I have made 7.5% profit on account balance. It’s about patience and waiting until the conditions are right before attempting to trade. Sagar’s comments about the homework he does over the weekend to set a bias helped reinforce that lesson. I realised that I have been trying these last few months to push the boundaries, trying to get into a trend early instead of patiently waiting until a trend was truly in place. Of course, I do know this, we all do, it’s just a matter of being disciplined about it and being patient. Simple, really! Thanks to all who have helped me stay on the right track!

I can not say much about Guppy as I'm yet to understand and master it in depth. But, per my trading rules, its NO entry at all. Price is in real consolidation mode. London 1st candle, bearish, 2nd candle big bullish (almost bullish engulfing). 3rd candle, copy book hammer, indicating price will go up. 4th candle, bearish again, price not going anywhere. Big time indecision. Look left, same thing happened, day before during London and price / structure repeats itself. No trade till the consolidation zone is broken, either of the side. Cheers

I was in both a USDCHF and a USDCAD trade yesterday. The former did well and luckily I got out of the latter manually at breakeven. It is clear from these two charts why the one worked and the other didn't. USDCHF had a steep slope (and thus price was mostly outside of the 10 EMA channel), while USDCAD had a much shallower slope and thus price was mostly inside the 10 EMA channel. Comparing the two side-by-side shows this difference powerfully. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I've just noticed something interesting - clear divergence on USDCAD. I have very seldom looked at or used divergence, but if it is a thing then we should expect a bullish breakout.

I have a question for the experienced traders. How does the release of the FOMC minutes affect your trading on that day? Looking forward to your replies!

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I wait for next day Tokyo (today) to open, analyze how the different currencies have acted / reacted to the news. Trade from Tokyo open, trade those pairs, which are least affected from the news, less riskier. I trust in "Live for another day", protect your equity to make profit when situations become clearer and profitable. Cheers

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Thanks, Sagar. It's now 8 am where I am, 3 pm in Tokyo, so for me I guess the markets would have settled and new patterns would be emerging right now, just before the London open. What do you do in the 8 or so hours before the release of the FOMC minutes? Is it a big enough event to remain out of the market, or do you avoid just certain pairs, or do you ignore it and carry on as normal?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I just shorted GJ now, 44 pips target. With $ Prelim gdp news in 6 hours, want to get few pips and stay away from the market. Not just FOMC, I'M SIDELINES 6-8 hours before any hot news event/s. But except for, FOMC / NFP, I trade other pairs. For eg, when UK announces employment change (claimant count change), I stay away from GBP pairs, but trade other pairs. But FOMC and NFP, strictly no trades, because they affect whole gamut of currencies. Cheers

I had one of those perfect days yesterday. Placed 8 trades (on H4), closed 8 trades just before the London close. Banked 2.8% profit for the day. Today is NFPs. No need to trade and spoil yesterday! I have noticed that if I start trading after the third H4 candle opens, which is two hours before the London open, then price very often goes nowhere for quite some time and I have to wait and wait until the real action starts. The real action starts with the New York open (i.e. the beginning of the overlap period). So, to get into trades before price has started making big moves I am thinking I should wait until the 4th candle of the day opens. This will allow me to get into trades in time to catch the overlap period. By this time the trade directions for the day have also started showing themselves more clearly. That is what I did yesterday and it seems to have worked well.

Before I discovered GMMAs I used Nial Fuller's approach based on the 8 and 21 EMAs, horizontal (or fixed) levels and setups using inside bars and pinbars (that's it in a nutshell - doesn't do justice to it). Although it made sense, something about it never 'gelled' for me and I moved on to using just the EMAs as dynamic S/R levels and pullbacks to the EMAs. And that worked very well for me for quite some time. Then I discovered GMMAs and the Walvekar method, which, in combination, provide a complete package of trend identification and trend continuation, plus specific methods for entry and exit. But still, the 8 and 21 EMAs remained my comfort zone. With the Walvekar influence I started combining the 8 and 21 EMA pullback approach with the long-term GMMAs, and that's where I am now. I use inside bar and two-bar pullbacks to the EMAs and stop orders for entries. This is what it looks like when all put together. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Conservative stop placement saves the day I placed this trade yesterday using a sell stop order as shown, hoping that it would break through that recent support level on the 5th attempt, but price retraced yet again and it almost got stopped out. What saved the trade was using not the nearest high for the stop, but the one next higher, as shown on the chart. While this conservative approach requires me to use a smaller lot size, it saved this trade and has done many times previously. I have adopted this approach as standard practice.

Part 2 of this trade After most periods of consolidation there is usually a breakout. It happened here too - my second bit of luck! But it does make a case for seeking out such pauses in a downtrend and attempting to catch the breakout when it happens, given that it is somewhat predictable. I have placed an optimistic target of 200 pips and am using a trailing stop to lock in profit as price makes its way down. If I never get to the target there will still be some reward.

The trend is very down here if you look at the daily chart and it's been around a long time, perhaps too long, so I was in two minds about selling this. The steady and evenly-spaced long-term guppy lines gave me confidence. I used a pullback on the H4 chart for my sell stop order. It is a two-bar pullback and the pullback candle happens to be a pinbar, so placing the entry at the base of the PB was a simple decision. I now have an EA (on a VPS, not here) that I had adjusted to suit my needs - it can move the stop to breakeven at a certain number of pips and once that has been done it can start trailing the stop along an MA of my choice. My settings are B/E at 50 pips, the EMA period = 14 and the applied price = open (most indicators use the close, but I thought the open seemed to work better). The trade is now at B/E and I'm waiting for the trailing stop to kick in to lock in some profit if it doesn't reach the target. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yesterday was ... interesting. I placed 6 trades and none of them was triggered. Basically, nothing moved all day, just because one country has an independence celebration. So I deleted all orders and started again today. Not only are the trades in a "riper" condition today, but we are done with 4th July and things are moving. On NZDUSD the daily is in a strongly established downtrend, perhaps a bit too well-established (elderly) but it seems to have life left in it. Based on that dominant higher timeframe bias I placed a sell stop order on H4. Note the SL on H4 does not use the nearby high for its position, but above the one before that. By placing the SL more conservatively and by using the GMMAs for guidance on trend direction and I have not been stopped out for a while now.

I have entered four trades today. Three are doing fine (in fact, those three have already made 1% return on account balance and my day is still young).

I got a nice entry soon after a trend reversal. This means that the trade might continue for some time so I decided to leave it to run over the weekend and into next week. I was at breakeven before the NFPs, so left it open and took the risk. It paid off so let's see what happens next week. I'm trailing the stop along the 21 EMA this time (green line). The target is at 270 pips, which is optimistic/unrealistic, but if I get there it will be an early Christmas and if the TS stops me out on maybe 100 pips it will still be a good return.

The market is cruel! Stop placement is a science, an art and a lottery!! In both these cases below I placed the SL at the second recent high / low plus a few pips extra in order to avoid unnecessary stop-outs. But that caution wasn't enough. This USDCAD trade was stopped out a few hours ago by the merest of touches, and now it looks as if price might drop back down again, having done its nasty work. If it now continues up I'll feel better about it - that would be a proper stop-out, a real smack in the face.

Excellent trading, Rajesh. Were you using your usual "Walvekar" method? And mostly on H1 timeframe? Have you managed to keep up this kind of success rate? My experience is that when I have had a good run and gained confidence (and probably become too bold) the market has a way of coming back at me.

This long consolidation period on H4 is getting tighter, soon to break?

You're showing us the way - very good trading and excellent results! I have two questions. 1. When you initially place a trade, where do you place the SL, what is your standard practice? 2. Does your broker allow you to place two partial TPs? I'm wondering how you take profit twice so that the results both show green in the account history table.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
[quote=Spudfan;14102764]{quote} 1. When you initially place a trade, where do you place the SL, what is your standard practice? one difference in forex trading is the contracts have no expiry. that makes things easier. so i dont place any stoploss. if the trade goes against me means the trend has changed,i hold on to the trade, wait for trend to change again in my direction and then add positions as per trend strength.... keep patience till all my positions are squared off at the same TP. 2. Does your broker allow you to place two partial TPs? I'm wondering how you take profit twice so that the results both show green in the account history table. there are no partial profits . i take two positions at the same price or close to one another. ( look at the last two GJ positions in my table below.) my current running trades......... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #625 ---
... Ignored On point 1, the SL, when you do use an SL I would like to know what your standard practice is with placing SLs? On the recent swing point, or on the more distant EMA line or something else? I would be cautious about not using an SL, unless you will be disciplined about closing a bad trade manually. In many cases price does reverse and go the way you want it, but there are enough trades that don't do that to damage your balance significantly. Once they have gone bad it is very difficult to close them with a significant loss, and so we wait and hope and wait and hope and it keeps going worse. Just one or two trades amongst many can cause major losses. I'm speaking from experience here. On point 2, placing two trades is a good solution because one can treat them independently and close them at different target levels. Good idea. Thanks for your valuable contributions.

You certainly have! I have another question for you. In your m anual you say this: " A new trend is defined by the long-term (L/T) group of EMAs crossing over and re-aligning themselves in their correct order." Yet as an experienced user you are able to vary what you do with the confidence of experience behind you. Do you ever use the colour change to define a new trend (and not wait for the crossover), or do you ever wait for the crossover but not wait for the EMAs to re-align themselves?

I have seen various setting for the EMA, Just to confirm, the EMA's are 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 for this method (Rajesh) of trading... For the RSI, to confirm the settings 6 and 12, I assume the colour is more of a visual aid than anything else?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Your EMA settings are correct, and as Daryl Guppy originally published them. Colour change is a visual aid, but a rather useful one, more so for the Guppy lines, imo. I find when I'm scanning the charts for a new trend and pullback to the trend that the colours of the 30 and 60 lines and all the inner lines are very helpful. Reduces eye-strain!

--- 帖子 #640 ---
GUPPY is a trend following system. always wait for the trend to establish. that is crossover followed by first pullback. change in color will tell you that the trend is changing. this is the instrument you should watch for a possible entry. crossover confirms change in trend . first pullback continuation pattern is the best entry and excellent risk reward ratio. Attached Image (click to enlarge) this is the H1 chart of DOW with explaination. Attached Image (click to enlarge) entry with 2 lots. book profit of one lot on first target ( fibo T1). after that shift sl to break even. that makes your trade risk free.... a good trend will give you target to T4 or T5 easily. candles closing outside channel indicates a very strong trend. if candle closes inside the channel shift your SL to that candle high/low or the opposite ema channel.

Rajesh, according to my analysis there was no trade on this entire new trend that started around the 18th August.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) for target. fibo expansion drawn from low of breakout candle to swing high. TP 1is 1.618% of fib expansion. initial stoploss is upper line of ema channel..... can trail SL on that line value. after TP 1 is acheived , move your SL to break even. as long as the candles are closing outside the channel and rsi 6 is below rsi 12 the trend is strong. if candle closes inside the channel, move your sl to the high of that candle with some buffer irrespective of your profit or loss. if the trend remains strong, your second target can be previous swing low and/or beyond that ie.

Hi guys, Attached Image (click to enlarge) I believe this meets the rules, please confirm/deny. I have left the chart unmarked so everything can be clearly seen but I will try to explain everything here. We have a change in trend from the green dash line - downtrend. All L/T EMAs are evenly spread. The candle to close beyond the 10EMA channel is the entry candle. RSI 6 and RSI 12 are below 50 level. The fib tool is to be applied from the low of the breakout candle to the high of the recent swing high. Have I misses anything?

We have a change in trend from the green dash line - downtrend. All L/T EMAs are evenly spread. The candle to close beyond the 10EMA channel is the entry candle. RSI 6 and RSI 12 are below 50 level. The fib tool is to be applied from the low of the breakout candle to the high of the recent swing high. Have I misses anything? EDIT: Just spotted it, there is no clear gap between the 10EMA channel and the L/T EMAs. No trade as rules not met.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
you have not missed anything. this is a valid entry . only the entry has to at the close of the entry candle

--- 帖子 #657 ---
do not expect all trades to be in profit. just keep losses to minimum and let profits run in a strong trend.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I'm not sure about the last sentence. Rajesh - I'm sure I have seen you say something like this before - could you comment? The gap between the LT and 10 EMA channel took place during the initial trend. Now we are just seeing a follow through, so that lack of gap isn't a deal-breaker.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Here's a trade I took earlier today. Like Bee-Hop, I believe this meets all the rules, although as this is Friday with a big USD news item coming up shortly (Core PCE Price Index), rules or not, it might not have been advisable. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #660 ---
entry close to the LT group are the best trades as long as other all other critetia are fulfilled. this is true after a significant fib retracement of 61.8 or 50 %. this is the continuation pattern we are looking for in a established trend. you might not get so significant retracements when the trend is very strong. smaller retracements in trend are to be treated as flag trades. ( i have quoted one example above). but these entries should be early when the trend is forning. the farther the price action moves away from the LT group, higher are the chances of it to retrace back to the LT group.

I was just following the pdf that you took the effort to produce. Unless I have misunderstood it, which is more than likely as I am totally new to this thread/strategy, paragraph 4 of the pdf reads as follows: 'We should also be aware of the Guppy rules: (i) the L/T EMA's should not show compression; and ( ii ) there should be a clear gap between the S/T and L/T groups of EMA's . Dr Walverkar has replaced the S/T group with the 10EMA, but he still advises looking at a standard Guppy chart to check that the gap has appeared. ' Unless I missed previous post to say otherwise within the thread but it has been clarified in https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14114546 by Dr Walverkar.

Your questions sparked an unrelated thought that might help. We get two main types of pullbacks - little ones and big ones (such wisdom and insight ). Some call the big pullbacks refreshes, and it is these that are what Rajesh advocates using for entries. They occur after price has been moving steadily with some small pulbacks along the way. It seems that the interval between refreshes can be anything from 5 bars to 20 bars. So entering after price has been moving steadily for a time starts becoming dangerous because the odds of a refresh happening become greater. If you use a big stop distance (like the swing point before the most recent one) you can survive such a big pullback, and sometimes not even then. So the wisdom in the Walvekar method is to ignore small pullbacks (although Rajesh's recent introduction of a flag pattern pullback is a bit of a curveball) and wait for a clear refresh where price retraces back to or close to the LT EMAs. These often lead to strong subsequent moves. To make things even safer, I advocate for using a stop order so that if price continues retracing you might not get triggered prematurely. The Walvekar entry method of using a break of the 10 EMA channel is another way of achieving a similar thing in that it delays the entry until price has gained momentum (noting that once price is moving outside / beyond the 10 EMA channel, we consider it to be a strong trend). In the example I posted we have pullbacks and a refresh, but this pair is currently undergoing a monster refresh. Who knows whether this will turn into a proper reversal, or whether it will resume its down move. But given that price has been moving steadily and relentlessly down since the beginning of June, I'm not in the mood for selling now. Let it go further down if it wants, but I'm not keen to get caught in a bullish reversal.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
The way I have come to understand this is that the initial trend must be formed correctly with a clear gap etc, but thereafter as long as we get a good pullback (refresh) then we can ignore that requirement as having been fulfilled earlier in the trend. As long as price breaks out of the 10 EMA channel (and the RSIs are pointing the correct way etc), then we are good to go. I think the manual can be taken as the "orthodox" position that is being interpreted along the way. It introduces grey areas that will puzzle you, but that's how it is.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
try to keep things simple ..... there are no hard and fast rules. let me try to explain. guppy is a trend trading system. the trend is decided by the long term guppies. 1 ) this is a random chart of my templete. Attached Image (click to enlarge) now, why 10 ema channel instead of short term guppies? here i have removed the long term guppies and the 10 ema channel and short term guppies are in place.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) you can see clearly that the channel and the guppies go hand in hand...... i found 10 ema convinient.... you can replace with 7,8,9... or anythng. but it is easier to intrprete the channel and color change rather than the short term guppies. 2 ) guppy does not clearly define entry or may be i didnt understand it correctly. so we defined our entry as close of candle beyond the channel. 3 ) a stoploss at the opposite end of the channel is logical, no roket science in that. in a good trend, the price action will not go near the high/low of the entry cande. so even that can be your initial SL. 4 ) to define targets..... i found fib expansion 1.6 gets hit almos all the time. so 2 lots, book profit of 1 lot at T1, move stoploss of second lot to break even. if T1 is not hit and the trade goes against you, initial SL at entry ie. the other end of ema channel, is hit.... you loose. but this is the risk you have to take in any trade. again i never recommended a SL at swing high/low. for me its a too big a risk. once T1 is acheived, your trade becomes risk free... 5 ) to define the streangth of the trend or momentum. rsi 6/12 come into play and off course the ema channel. as long as the rsi are allighned (and below/above 50 ) and candle close is outside the channel, the momentum is strong, the strength of the trend is strong. so for your risk free second lot, you may ride the momentum or book profits when ever you feel satisfied (or fibo expansion targets ). trailing SL at the opposite end of the channel is the easiest way out( in a strong trend). 6 ) the zig zag in our templete are to define high/lows and to draw fibo retracements. any retracement upto 50% is a healthy retracement. it does not mean it has to be exactly at that levels. but anything below 50% and candle close beyond ema channel in the direction of the trend is a very good entry. 7) about the color coding in our templete..... it is for visual intrerpretation. as long as the 30/60 are above/ below eachother the trend is up/down accordingly. only a crossover will define a change in trend. 8 ) any entry according to our rules close to the LT guppy is a low risk high reward trade. best entries are on the first pullback. in a very strong trend you mightnot get a significant pullback. here flag trades come into play. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ding-the-trend 9) anything which can support your entry..... flag, trendline break, rsi trendline break, rsi below/above 50, divergence in any indicators, fundamental analysis, news....... etc. etc...... use it. 10 ) all hope trades are hopeless trades. take a calculated risk.

Hey guys, @Walvekarraje, what is a pullback? Is there a set of rules to explain or a number of candles that make a pullback a pullback? Or is it a case that you see a retracement and then the first candle that closes above the channel to form the entry candle considered as a pullback having been completed? What would consider as a the pullback in the image attached, the yellow circle or the green circle? I suppose one could enter on the first (yellow) but would potentially get stopped out but could enter again on the last green candle (green circle). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I was not taking into account the RSI as I was concentrating on what is a pullback, I dont believe I explained myself very well, hence the confusion. However, your last post has cleared up what I was trying to ask. Sometimes a image can explain more than just words. Have a great weekend all.

Hello Walvekar! Why not an earlier entry as marked on my chart?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Thanks to people keeping this thread alive, especially Walvekar and Spudfan.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
No reason not to, as far as I can see. However, I have started trading only in the direction of the timeframe one higher, and in this example H4 is bullish. I marked your H1 candle on 25 Aug with a vertical line and this is what it looks like on H4. No short for me. I think Rajesh does not need to do this as carefully because T1 calculated using the Walvekar method is in most cases close by, so, if you follow the method correctly, price is highly likely to reach it, regardless of dominant trend direction. But if you go for slightly more distant targets, then the dominant trend takes on greater importance. Neither method is right or wrong, it's just what is a good fit for you.

i made a very stupid mistake today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) took this trade at start of downtrend ( not according to our rules, but on strong resistance, and divergence ) first order instead of a sell order a buy order got executed.( my mistake) second order was proper. realised it just now. any suggestions of how to correct this mistake?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Welcome to being human! Mistakes happen. I think you have two options, although by now you are a long way in loss. 1. All indications are that the USD will continue being bullish for some time, so you can live in hope that it will. Have a look at H4 - price might bounce off the Guppy 60 EMA, which is where it is now. The Guppy EMAs on H4 are clearly bullish - trust the system and it might pay off. But D1, oh my, it is going down 2. The other option - look for the close button, close your eyes and press it.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Would it not be best to just close the buy trade? You have the sell the trade which will negate some of the loss of the other trade. Overall you will still be in a loss but only slightly. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #681 ---
yes. i did close the buy trade after the first bullish candle close. the sell trade is negating the loss...

--- 帖子 #682 ---
With all the advice you were given you couldn't go wrong! It can be painful killing trades that have gone wrong but in my experience it is usually the right thing to do. Close your eyes and hit that button! But ... the Guppy LT EMAs provide an extra layer of information that really helps. I have found I am much more willing to leave a trade that I am worried about because of the Guppy lines and in most cases the trade does pull back into line and follow the trend.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
thank you for your kind words sir ! after booking loss for my mistake..... i took a flag trade re-entry and all my loss was recovered. as you rightly said, the LT guppies decide the trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #684 ---
--- look at my re-entry candle. 1) first pullback, continuation pattern.. 2) previous support breached at the close of the candle ( blue zig zag circles )... 3) perfect flag pattern.... 4) LT guppies well spaced..... ---- as the chart and the PA goes you need to modify your trades. ------ some basic knowledge of technical analysis is required..... -------- last but not least, you need to identify the entry candle in real time, back testing and historical charts dont matter.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
What do yo think was not good about this setup? Too long an uptrend?

--- 帖子 #686 ---
The logic was sound and it followed the rules, so perhaps you just have to say it's one of those that didn't work. You probably would have got out at break-even. I agree, though, that the trend was looking a bit old and also not all that steep. It had been almost in consolidation mode prior to this. This is one of the conundrums we face - how to enter when PA is slow or horizontal, knowing that it should break out in an explosion of movement soon. We can't enter such a trade once we see it, because that's too late, so we need to somehow get into the trade when it is still looking sleepy. You did the best you could but it didn't quite work as you'd hoped. So be it.

An attempt to combine price action and guppy system.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) added MTF ZIGZAG( D!) and RSI 50 to the H1 charts. First entry : 1) daily zigzag printed ( magenta circles). price reversed from there with a big upper wick. 2) following that there are 3 consequitive bearish candles. the third candle closed below the previous support ( previous magenta circles ) 3) the 10 ema channel red indicating downtrend. so entered at the close of that candle. Second entry : 1) all lt guppies change in bearish color ( no crossover) 2) candle closing beyond channel.. entry at the close of candle. SL at swing high for both entries... RSI 50 changed color confirming beasish trend. SL trailed to following swing high and target at previous swing low. looks like my trailing SL will be triggered ( with significant profit ) but the guppies and rsi 50 are telling me that this is a pullback in the downtrend. so even if the trailing SL is triggered, will wait for re-entry as per our guppy rules. edit : trailing sl was hit as i was typing this post

--- 帖子 #693 ---
note : 1) all candles closing below channel : strong downtrend 2) previous support ( blue zig zag H1 ) decisively broken when candle closed below that. 3) rsi 50&lt; rsi12&lt; rsi6. all suggesting a strong downtrend.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
welcome sir, 1) your entry should be at the close of last but one candle as per rules. 2) your SL should be at the swing high. a late entry does not mean a wrong entry.... but the risk reward ratio changes drastically.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
sorry sir, all your entries are too late. 1) lt guppy cluster 2) candle close beyond 10 ema channel 3) rsi6 and rsi 12 cross and both above/below 50 that is our entry candle. in a strong trend, a late entry will not matter but your initial stoploss is not the swing high/low.... it has to be the other end of the ema channel.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
ideal entry candles marked on chart...... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) the fibo from low of entry candle to previous swing high for targets. even if your entry is late, the fibo remains the same, late entry does not mean wrong entry, only that the SL at previous swing becomes too much as far as risk reward ratio is concerned . so i suggest to have your initial stoploss at the opposite end of the channel.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
A few suggestions. 1) keep a watch on daily candle ( it got deleted from my charts, but i have inserted it again). trade in the direction of daily candle. 2) introduction of rsi 50 helps a lot to identify change in trend much before the LT guppies are formed. if you can enter a trade early in the trend, profits are bigger. 3) introduction of D1 zigzag also helps.(magenta/lime circles are D1 zigzag. red/blue are H1). when D1 zigzag is printed on the chart and rsi 50 changes color, expect a reversal of trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) in the chart above a sell stop order can be placed at the lower channel. second lot can be added if the candle closes below the channel and rest of our entry rules are met.... this can be a little risky,but will also give a early entry in the trend. T1 usually possible because of momentum. Attached File(s) GUPPY.tpl 10 KB | 283 downloads

I think you trade sell when price is under the EMA240 is a result from experience, as you dont use EMA200 (conventional TA) or EMA255 (Elliot wave drawer)

--- 帖子 #705 ---
happy to know that some one is following this thread. especially when you are quoting a very old post. i beleive that you are not trading instrument but you are trading instrument in a specific timeframe. any indicator settings should change according to the timeframe. so if you identify a trend in higher timeframe, you look for pullback continuation pattern in lower timeframe. that way your entry is defined, stoploss is small but targets are on the higher timeframe trend. let me try to explain in very simple terms "you trade sell when price is under the EMA240 is a result from experience" not experience but simple logic : 1) EMA 240 on M1 = moving average 1 on H4. 2) RSI 60/90 is rsi 1 on H1/ RSI 1 on 1 and half hr chart. 3) the daily candle has to be the color of your entry. means you are trading with the trend (continuation pattern) and not against the trend. so i am using MA 1 on H4 and RSI 1 on H1 for my entry. 240 instead of 200 or 255 ? have you seen MA1 or rsi 60/90 used anywhere in any trading systems ? again i rarely scalp but if i do this logic works best for me.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
SHOCKING, I do learn to use the ema, rsi and macd so and so on ... but never pay attention on the link of value and TF, EMA1 in H4 equal EMA240 in M1, RSII 60, RSI 90 and RSI1 in M60, M90 etc like your argument it does open my eyes here. Thank you for I have the chance to come across post, and receive your explanation.. It makes very much sense now.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Thankyou for the explanation walvekarraje, how do you get the Daily candle on the chart, it doesn't come across with the template.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Honestly, i dont trade lower time frames neither i recommend you do. H1 with a established trend (after LT GUPPY crossover) is a low risk high reward strategy. fibo targets and moving stoploss to BE at the earliest make trades less stressful. not loosing money is more important than earning.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Some of you might remember this post from 15 June. I've been following this approach again and it has proved profitable for me. It just feels right. Here's one of the trades I placed today. It's still running, is now at break-even so I'm going to leave it for my trailing stop running on a VPS to take care of or hope that it reaches the target at 190 pips from entry.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Stopped out at break-even. There must be a sweet spot for how soon to move to break-even. Move too soon and it is highly likely it will be stopped out. Move too late and it might reverse all the way to a 1R loss, or it survives and goes big. My sense is to move fairly soon, because a zero loss is fine, and even if only 1 in 4 of those goes big, overall it amounts to a good strategy. Your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Same again. I entered using a stop order on the latest closed candle, which allowed an entry close to the EMAs - reduces the distance a pullback might go and offers a better R/R than an entry further from the EMAs. The current candle did pull back a bit but the presence of the long-term EMAs gave me confidence that everything would be fine. So far it has been. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Same again. The two EMAs I mentioned in my 15 June post are the 21 and 8 EMAs, that I have used for several years and feel comfortable with. There's nothing magic about those two numbers, just familiarity. Sell stop order was placed at the base of the green candle (third one back). SL above recent high, TP at 100 pips.

"in the chart above a sell stop order can be placed at the lower channel." 1) sorry to be quoting my own post, but i did exactly the same. a basic knowledge of technical analysis is a must before you follow any system/strategy. basic knowledge of trendline, flags, fibo retracements is a must. 2) trade the time frame, not the instrument.... if you see the UC chart now, in higher time frame it is in uptrend. 3) once in trade you have to monitor it closely. trade one instrument only, give justice to one trade. 4) trail SL and try to get it to BE or minimal profit as early as possible. trade with minimal 2 lots. target of lot 1 is equal to your SL. 5) follow the LT GUPPY. this is the core of the strategy. 10 ema channel will give you exact entry. fibo targets defined. what else ?

Here's another adaptation of the GMMAs to think about. I have used an EMA crossover indicator to paint arrows on the chart just to make it quicker or easier to see the long-term EMA crossover point. The Stochastics are set to 5,3,3. You need to be aware that using the stochastics as if they predict the future or have some kind of magic in them can lead to losses. In this example they are useful just to enter at a pullback after the GMMAs have crossed over and settled down again. Otherwise, remove them, or minimise them so they don't tempt you. This pattern of crossover, new trend, pullback is, of course, nothing new as it lies at the heart of the Walvekar method. This is just a variation on that theme. The pattern does repeat itself over and over, so if this is all you trade you should do well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I placed this trade this morning, buy stop order at the tip of the pinbar. The tail of the PB pulled right back into the long-term EMAs, so even though the stochastics didn't go fully into oversold territory I placed the order anyway. If price had continued retracing my order would (hopefully) have remained untouched, but it has started moving in my direction, so now I'm in. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here's a gift - a very useful indicator. It gives a snapshot of trend behaviour across whichever timeframe you ask it to show. It also provides a dashboard so you can look at any pairs you ask for all displayed in one window on any chart. Don't load the dashboard option on all charts because it starts slowing things down and eventually it freezes. The indicator uses 3 MAs and when those three are aligned the indicator shows green or red for that timeframe, or if they are not yet aligned, it shows grey. You can use whatever periods you want, eg 200/100/50 or in the example here I used 60/21/8 EMA, which is a lot faster. So should I have gone long with this trade? Attached Image (click to enlarge) What about this one? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have fun!

--- 帖子 #736 ---
off course i loose. only i try to keep my losses minimum. one way to do this is to keep your initial stoploss at the high of the entry candle in a short trade and low of the entry candle in the long trade. if you observe the charts, you will see that in a good trend, these levels are never breached. if these levels are broken then it is not a healthy trend to begin with. secondly if you find that the momentum in the trend is weak, bring your SL to BE as early as possible. all candles closing outside the channel suggests a strong and healthy trend. if candle closes inside the channel, move your SL to high/low of that candle, irrespective of profit or loss. rsi crossing in opposite direction is also a indication to exit the trade. a hope trade is always a hopeless trade. dont expect or anticipate the trend to follow your direction.

" this uptrend appears to be exausted. the LT guppy have become flat and horizontal. recommendation is to trade the first or second pullback. these trades have low risk, high reward. here usually the momentum is strong. 2) your entry is also at a very strong resistance ( white arrows) Attached Image (click to enlarge) i suggest you keep a tight stoploss. or move your stoploss near to breakeven as early as possible i may be wrong in my analysis. but watch your trade carefully

Excellent price structure analysis, Rajesh. I find it is so easy to become entranced or captured by the indicators and forget about taking a step back to see the bigger picture. "When in doubt, zoom out".

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Well spotted. How did I miss that. I am too focused on the indicators and forget the rest. Sometime I even forget to look at the RSI and just go with the channel and MA and enter the trade. Need to focus the mind more. Thank you Rajesh

I will drop down to the H1, try my luck there see if it suits me any better.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
This is all about trading reversions to the mean (or pullbacks to the long-term EMAs). This idea might sound too simple, or just plain obvious, but it is quick AND it helps avoid any distraction by whatever indicators we are using. It's a simple question: "Is price close to the EMAs?" If yes, we can have a closer look, if not, just move on. This pair is far from the EMAs - move on. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But this pair is or has been very close to the EMAs - so it's worth a closer look. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I use stop orders for my entries to avoid getting into a trade where the pullback keeps pulling back and stops me out. Or sometimes I'll get into a trade but price gives one last spike the wrong way, stops me out and then goes the "correct" way. So how do I sit back, wait for that to happen and only then enter? (If it is at all possible to get that right). That's what I've been practising today. On H1 so that I learn 4 times faster than on H4. Here's an example: Price is clearly overbought as per the stochastic, but it can continue in that condition for some distance. All the stoch can do is give an indication that there is an overbought/sold condition. It is not definitive. So how far behind the action do I trail my entry? And do I tighten it up as it starts looking like price is about to move? In this case I have been conservative. The entry is on the second closed candle, so I'm mostly out of danger of a premature entry. But there are clear signs that the dominant trend is now resuming, so I want to get in on that. So perhaps I should now move the entry to the youngest closed candle, not the second youngest. Those are the questions I have been asking myself today using these dummy entries. I forgot to mention, but the other key question is how far to follow price before it is obvious that it's not going to work? If the price pullback crosses the long-term EMAs completely (as it does, surprisingly often, and still comes back), do you walk away as soon as it closes on the "wrong" side, or wait, or what? My view is to keep the entry at the near edge of the EMAs and, as long as the overall price structure shows that a viable trade is still possible, just to wait and see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #750 ---
We have a new downtrend, a pullback and the stochastics show a strong overbought condition. But otherwise it's beginning to look as if price is going to turn up. I have moved my sell stop order up to follow price, but am not going further. Price must come back to me or if the current signs of price going bullish continue, I'll cancel my order. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #751 ---
First trade of the week. Coming out of a strong consolidation shown by horizontal and close EMAs, then a breakout with the dominant trend, quick pullback, stochs oversold. The stop loss is well below the recent swing low. Entry using a buy stop order. Notice that the 120 EMA, which I haven't been using recently, is below the EMAs, so in effect it's as if I added an extra EMA to the Guppy long-term line-up. Backtesting shows that this extra layer is worth waiting for. A weakness is that the pullback did not go fully to the long-term EMAs and this might still happen

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Another one, also a JPY pair. This pullback to the EMAs looks better than the previous example, looking stronger all round, I think. The 120 EMA in position below the GMMAs reinforces the decent uptrend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Both this trade and the previous one (AUDJPY) have retraced all the profit gained during the day. Both are close to B/E, both are now sitting on the EMAs. Of course I don't like this at all! But the price structure and GMMAs still look good. Only the stochs are aiming down (but I use those only for entries, nothing else). I have to trust the system now, and if it fails, walk away, there's another one tomorrow. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I'm going to be away for a while. Good luck with your trading and see you on the other side!

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I've been doing some thinking while I am away! Firstly, enough of hiding behind my nickname. My name is Alistair and my new FF name is going to be AlistairC. As per the FF rules I can't use two usernames, so I'm going to change over to the new name soon. Not sure whether all of my Spudfan posts will automatically be updated or whether they will stay with that name. The other thing is that I have decided to go back to using just the 8 and 21 EMAs that have been my main trading system since a long time ago. This means that I don't fully belong here any more. I will look for a suitable MA Crossover thread or maybe just start my own. This is not a rejection of the GMMAs or of the Walvekar method, not at all, it's just that we must all find what suits our personalities, mindsets and instincts. I'll remain subscribed here so I can stay in touch. Some history behind my Spudfan name - a trader called Spudfyre came up with an amazing multi-stochastic system that I really liked but could never use successfully. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-thread-theory . The point here is that Spudfyre seemed like a special human being and I admired that, given how much ugly stuff also happens on forums like this. So I became a fan of Spud! Good luck all!

--- 帖子 #764 ---
firstly your chart does not fit into guppy system. there is no trend. the price is dancing above and below the mmas. such a instrument is an avoid in any strategy. you may get stopped out in both directions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) you should be looking at charts like this where there is a established trend and the price action is closer to the 50 ema. secondly i prefer to look at charts without any candelsticks. i use apb candels when i am entering a trade. in the next post i will try to explain the entry setups in detail. till then i suggest you go through the word and pdf documents posted in this forum. this will help to understand the system easily

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Thank you for your advice. I read your document.I upload one snapshot after I understand。 please correct me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Yes , absolutely right. the basic concept is to go long when all mmas turn blue and short when all turn red. i will share few chart details this weekend.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi Dr. Walvekarraje, there is one confuse for me. for instance, GBPUSD H4 is going short in cross, but switch to H1 in same position, it is not. so How can I process this case? in fact, in market, so many case like this.LTF&amp;HTF is oppist direction. Thanks. Have nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #768 ---
i think your vertical line on H4, the lower mmas are blue. it is the next H4 candle when they all turn red. so your H1 vertical line is obviously 4-8 candles prior to the actual entry candle. otherwise your analysis is correct. confirm trend on H4. scale down to H! chart, wait for a pullback and continuation pattern on H1. if H4 is in downtrend, on H1 wait for few lower mmas to turn blue and again red. 1) in this case also make sure the daily candle is bearish 2) H4 price action should not be too far away from 50-100-200 lines. 3) H1 price action should also not be too far away from 50-100-200 lines. as always the first or second pullbacks are best to trade.

so you look at your charts in all timeframes and look at such setups developing. whichever timeframe the setup is developing is your trading timeframe. you are not trading an instrument but you are trading an instrument in a specific timeframe. i usually trade futures if setup is in M30 or H1. if setup is developing in H4/D1 i trade options. as mentioned somewhere in this thread, i ususlly trade only one instrument at a time and 2 lots. stoploss is at swing high/low. book one lot profit ar R:R 1:1 or according to fibo target T1( Fibo settings are posted somewhere in this thread)

--- 帖子 #774 ---
1) in india mt4 is not a trading platform with any broker. 2) indian markets are open only 6 hrs a day 3) there is no fixed set of rules and time frame. some basic principles of technical analysis as trendline break, flag trades, fibo retracements etc also come into play while managing a trade. so i dont think EA is possible. but if you can create EA , give it a try

--- 帖子 #775 ---
also it is always better to look one timeframe higher to confirm the direction of the trend. also it is better to look at the daily candle to confirm the todays trend . both should be inline with your entry .

--- 帖子 #776 ---
thank you for your detail chart, just several question highlight on snapshot.may you trade futures options, the spread i have to consider.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
1) entry will hit SL, wether entry or not? yes. it is a valid entry as per charts which subsiquently proved to be a false breakdown. do not expect all trades to be in profit. the only advantage of trading breakouts/breakdowns is you enter the trend quite early, and the risk reward ratio is very good if market moves in your direction. 2) these 3 due to miss entry , can i enter here? again yes. here the trend is well formed. such are the best entries with guppy system with high probablity win rate. also it also is a book picture flag trade where the pole of the flag is your first target. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3) the entry candle is too big..... here i usually draw fib retracement on the candle and enter at 38.2 0r 50 % levels. also entry below this candle low is also a valid entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge) i use the fibo tool very frequently in my trading. 50% retracements are very common and frequent and work very well with guppy system. fibo tool for targets also work very well for me. in my previous posts i have quoted multiple examples and settings for the fibo tool i use

Dr. Walvekarrje, in these 2 snapshot, I may think it is same scenirao as before,but not sure. please correct me. thanks. here may I follow H4 first， eventually I need entry in H4 after fisrst candle colsed.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
in both cases going short when all MMAs turn red is a valid entry Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) if gold is in downtrend on H4, pullback on H4 will look as uptrend on H1. you will always find different trends in different timeframes. we dont trade an instrument. We trade "an instrument is a specific timeframe which suits our setup/strategy" hope you understand.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
which tool you use to draw arrows and text ? your pics look very elegant...

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Just for example.... . Attached Image (click to enlarge) the chart above is a good chart to trade. in downtrend the retracement is 50% 8 candles touched the 50% mark which is acting as a strong resistance. also note that the 100 ema is acting as support and 150 ema as resistance.( MMAs act as dynamic support/resistance) finally the continuation pattern is visible on the current candle if all MMAs become red on close of this candle. the first target will be the 76.4% marl and 2nd target will be the 100% mark (significant downside is possible. these are high probablity trades worth trading

--- 帖子 #789 ---
the same chart above , if you use APB candles...... Attached Image (click to enlarge) the first bearish candle without any upper wickbecomes your entry candle ( marked with white arrows) , swing high becomes SL. the synergy APB is a trend trading system by itself and coupled with guppy can give earlier entries.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
lastly the chart also shows a trendline break and indicating an entry at the same candle. the 100 ema is acting as a flag trade. the daily candle is bearish. Attached Image (click to enlarge) multiple systems, technical analysis. indicating a short entry.on one single candle. this can be catogerised as a high probablity,low risk high reward trade. rest on some luck and how the market behaves.

thanks, Dr. Walvekarraje. this is big issue I meet. in HTF like H4 is downtrend,LTF H1 is uptrend, I always will unconsciously look for long entry ,otherwise I have to forget this LTF long opportunity and wait for H4 HTF short valid entry.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Thanks. Dr. Walvekarrje. I summarize 3 types of pullback, small and middle is good to entry once all MMS is same direction. the over pullback could be SL in first even second wave I highnight yellow part of first blue arrow. 1.before I always look for blue arrow to entry once pullback,in small and middle pullback is ok. also I call it is ectremity entry,these ectremity point I will look for different price action structure like W button, M head, head&amp;shoulder, pinbar,engulf and so on in next LTF,I think it is more subjective than objective. 2.for over pullback, I do not know when the pullback is finished.even first pullback done ,if entry, would be SL shortly or without lost.in this situation, I may think it is uptend and entry in next pullback, but without HTF(H4) view, will be SL again . I know all MMS is not smae direction, EMA 100,150&amp;200 is pressure, but a little candle is far those EMA100,150&amp;200 in orange arrow. . generally this uptrend could be entry.this is big issue to indicate direction, different thinking, different action&amp;result. greed of humanity will be magnified。 3.if only follow all MMS in same direction,need more analysis like HTF&amp;LTF in same direction, 4.also I use vegas tunnel before,I think it is similar with your system, but perfer your system. the more MMS give suppot/resistance,I can easyly recognize，need more pullback and trend picture in brain,HTF&amp;LTF would take care both, 5.just a little review and summary， in H1 or H4 when entry, all MMS same should be direction, and LTF follow HTF,better analysis LTF is changing direction or just pullbakc in HTF.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Dr. Walvekarraje， please take look the attached snapshot.Thanks. the issue I try to follow the H4 direction,once H4 pullback is done I will entry,but in rectangle previous almost same, pre. continue uptrend in H1 and touch EMA150 in H4 ,then go same direction in H4 now price going uptrend in H1 and breakout previous High. both scenario I want buy long in H1, also want sell once pullback is done in H1. hehe , this is humanity， 1.buy long in H1,but afraid price will go down shortly, 2.want wait for pullback finished in H1 and sell short in H1,but current price is breakout, have wait new pullback at least in H1(uptrend) 3.both H1 uptrend missed. this is over pullack in H1 of my Mental activity 4.before I may entry in extremly point,but I follow your stragey, all mms same direction,eventuly I will miss some profit, but more accuracy. 5.in extremly point it does not mater in small, middle or over pullback, more experience need.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
i suggest you to stick to one timeframe OR trade in direction of HTF. switching between timeframes causes analysis paralysis. We dont trade an instrument. We trade "an instrument is a specific timeframe which suits our setup/strategy"

thanks. I only focuse on TF now. for example you meation the current situation, should I entry in uper red arrow?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
the place where you have drawn the arrows , there is no short entry ( as all mmas never turn red) only possible entry is long ( as all mmas are blue)

--- 帖子 #802 ---
after read you instruction, do we add RSI as well? At the time of entry (i.e. when the breakout candle has closed beyond the 10 EMA channel): 1) All L/T EMAs must be evenly spread. This is the first criterion. if this is not fulfilled there is no trade. 2) The first candle to close beyond the 10 EMA channel is the entry candle. if this is not fulfilled (e.g. the candle closes inside the channel) we consider it as a consolidation, hence no trade. 3) RSI 6 should have crossed below RSI 12, and both should be below 50% (for a sell trade). 4) Supportive criteria but not mandatory: trend line break, flag formation, fib retracement less than 50.

Let us analise your GBPUSD chart on H! timeframe you were trading. for convinience i have changed color of LT guppies (20 to 50 ema) to lime green. Attached Image (click to enlarge) . "1) All L/T EMAs must be evenly spread. This is the first criterion. if this is not fulfilled there is no trade." do you see all theLT ( lime green) emas evenly spread ? yes.... "2) The first candle to close beyond the 10 EMA channel is the entry candle. if this is not fulfilled (e.g. the candle closes inside the channel) we consider it as a consolidation, hence no trade" instead of the channel we use all mmas turning blue at close of the candle. even if you apply the channel, the result might be the same. "3) RSI 6 should have crossed below RSI 12, and both should be below 50% (for a sell trade)." no. in this templete i dont use rsi because if you apply rsi the result might be the same. also change in color of all mmas identifies continuation pattern at an earlier candle than the rsi crossover or the 10 ema channel break. "4) Supportive criteria but not mandatory: trend line break, flag formation, fib retracement less than 50." do you see the trendline break and retracement less than 50? yes..... so your long entry candle is defined and all these criteria are fulfilled on one single entry candle... i have removed the rsi and channel because they dont make a significant diffrence in the setup and the charts are clean to analise. the first candle after the entry candle retests the trendline support confirming our long bias. the daily candle is bullish again confirming our long bias...

--- 帖子 #805 ---
welcome sir, any suggestions/guidelines on how you trade the templete ?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
as you meation before, for those big break candle, it is better entry in 38.2%or 50% of this break candle after closed. I highnight 2 example, please correct me. Thanks. because this big canlde in one hour it would be 40-60 pips. normally after close, always pullback.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
it is just another way to say buy the dip. You get to define for yourself what constitutes a dip. No consensus necessary. there are no hard and fast rules. these are only guidelines.

Hi Dr. walvekarraje Hope you are doing well. I have 3 question to query, hope you can help me. Thanks. 1.in this case USDCAD in dailly chart, it is pullback to 3 big EMA 100,150,200, my understand it is pullback and once the price is stop, I will try to entry. 2.but this price is still going down , in daily chart EMA is uptrend,so I think I should wait for price is stop, So I confuse, in daily chart is uptend I should wait, but switch to TF 30M, it is going down,in M30 I can follow your rules to entry once pulllback as your snapshot. the other 2 Rectangular box is same situation. 3.in red Rectangular box the price is cross over 3 big EMA, how can I handle this, also in other TF, i meet same situation, so I really confuse, High TF is uptrend baseed on EMA direction, but low TF is down trend. I do not know which one I should follow. your help are appreciated.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
i am doing very well sir. 1)unfortunately no one can predict when the pullback will stop and the uptrend continues. your entry on any timeframe must be when all the emas become blue (for long entry) in your diagram many emas are still red including the 100 ema. so just wait for all emas to turn blue and APB candle is lime at close. 2) Same is true for 30 min chart. just wait till all emas turn blue and lime apb candle close above emas.

Let me summarize,please correct me. 1.focuse on One TF M30 or H1 2.all Emms spread,blue for long,red for short,once the candle is closed and all Emms is blue or red,then can entry. 3.better first pullback to emm 50 to entry 4.sometime could consider Hight TF to confirm the trend,but better consider same direction. 5.sometime ema100&gt;150&gt;200,but candle already cross down and all Emms is red, this example you have Snapchat as before. 6.TP may use 1:1 or fib target thanks.have a nice weekend

true. some how ema50 got deleted in that templete . but it should be used. just add it from the indicators.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) one type of entry is when all ema change color as marked with arrow in above pic. this is actually at the begining of new trend . the draw back is the stoploss is quite big. ( if you consider the swing high/low for stoploss). i usually place my stoploss at the hihg/low of the entry candle with some buffer.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
second type of entry is after all emas have changed color( red in the pic) and one/few candles close inside the guppys. the candle that closes outside the guppy and all guppys again change color ( all red again) here the SL is at the swing high/low Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #831 ---
third type of entry is when the trend is established and young and candle closes beyond the guppies. this is a safer entry and easier to trail stoploss to subsequent swing high/low ad the trend develops. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #832 ---
To summarise Attached Image (click to enlarge) between entry 2 and entry 3 any red candle closing beyond guppy was a entry candle. sometimes it is very much possible to catch excellent trends

--- 帖子 #833 ---
look at this ( GBPJPY ) 1hr 40 min after entry.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #834 ---
here the candle never closed outside the red guppy, but it gave a long entry at the very next candle.... and a phenomenal breakout Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Both pairs giving another chance for reentry ..... 50 % fib retracement. Both offering confirmed entry... with SL Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) target = 100% of fibo

Yes. i only use the guppy system. i normally trade indian index in futures and equity in cash as positional/long term trades. i do trade forex in demo account in my free time. in my regular account i trade only the guppy system with all the rules outlined in this thread. in my demo forex account i experiment few other possibilities . here are the trades i took on thursday. all entries are at the beginning of the change in color of the MMAs but with trendline break, close beyond the channel and rsi cross. all entries are on H4 timeframe. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) indian markets are open only or 6 hrs so i trade H1 timerame for futures / options. D1 timeframe for equity cash entries. in forex H4 and D1 are are ideal to trade. i will be happy to answer any of your querries.

--- 帖子 #677 ---

--- 帖子 #678 ---

--- 帖子 #679 ---

No. they dont repaint once the candle is closed.

A followup of my trades Attached Image (click to enlarge) usdchf went through a consolidation, but all candles were closing inside the channel. now the price has broken a flag pattern and uptrend continues. rsi 6 &gt; rsi 12 and both above 50. uptrend established on guppy. i have shifted my trailing stoploss to rescent low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) nzdusd had a minor pullback. this also has broken flag pattern and downtrend continues. rsi 6 &lt; rsi 12 and both below 5. downtrend established on guppy. trailing stoploss shifted to some profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) usdcad also had a pullback, but now price is breaking a triangle pattern, uptrend not yet confirmed on guppy. rsi both above 50. trailing stoploss shifted to swing low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) this is the trade summary

--- 帖子 #682 ---
1)i have no knowledge of coding. the expert is not working in my account. sorry. 2) which timeframe are you using ? 3) target and stoploss varies in all timeframes. i usually place initial stoploss at either swing low or opposite end of channel. targets are using fibo as explained somewhere in the thread.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
after breaking out of triangle pattern usdcad gave a powerfull upswing reaching far beyond my first target. second lot trailing sl shited to low of this large candle. Attached Image (click to enlarge) other two trades running in desired direction i am trailing their sl in profit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #684 ---
usdcad second lot exited at trailing stoploss Attached Image (click to enlarge) other 2 pairs trending in desired direction. now traiing sl also in profit and expecting first to targets to hit (lime dashed lines). descent profit and no chance of loss.
