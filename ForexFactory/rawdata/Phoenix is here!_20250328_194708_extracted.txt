See the manual for further information. Of all the EA’s I tried, Firebird was the first EA that had the potential to make some money. On the other hand it had some bad habits that could result in a seriously drawdown of your account. &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; is an attempt to preserve the best of Firebird and to prevent the drawdowns of your account. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Maybe it’s too soon to launch &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I didn’t get the time to make all the necessary tests or implement proper error-controlling mechanism. Furthermore some parts need a little tweaking But Wednesday next week I will have my vacation but before that I want to deliver a bug-free &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. So my request to you is to test this version and give me as much feedback as can before next Wednesday!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; As starter of this thread and maker of &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; I think it’s just to make some rules. Well in fact only one: of course you are free to adapt &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; in any way you want, but please don’t post it in this thread! I want to keep the code of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; as clean as possible and want to prevent that in the end too many versions of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; are circulating in the same thread and nobody knows what version is doing what. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; If you think that you have a useful addition or modification for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, you can post it in this thread. We can discuss about it and when we all agree I can implement it in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I will use this first post for the updated versions of the EA, the indicator and the manual.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; That’s all. Let’s give it a try!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; In the ZIP-file you will find the following files:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Phoenix_EA_v1_0.mq4– the “Expert Advisor”&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Phoenix_IND_v1_0.mq4– the indicator to make the SafeArea visible (seen manual) you don’t need it for the EA to work!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Phoenix Manual v1.0.p Update 07/14/06 : Version 1.1 - Use the setting RoundupLots=true if your broker don't accept Lots like 0.24. - Is now working for MicroAccounts - Corrected a problem with GambleNow and MM - SafeArea was not working for EURJPY. Now it does. &lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- attachments --&gt;

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for the hard work.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thanks Hendrich - your da mannn..

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Ssssweet! Phoenix is there, I am gonna try it right now! Thanks Hendrick, it is hard to believe that there is an EA which is better than your last Firebird Yeah, I like this. That was pretty annoying in the last thread.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
First feedback: The code looks really nice, easy to read. Many comments Thanks, that's good programmer's style.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Great job, Hendrick. What are you using for SafePipsMinutes and SafePipsDistance? The default is 240 and 60, but the manual mentions 120 and 60. Thx.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Great work Hendrick. Looking forward to this EA.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I am kind of confused right now, could anybody please help me? I the manual, Hendrick always says he's on GMT + 2, later he says we have to select EUROPE/AMSTERDAM for conversion. Isn't Amsterdam GMT + 1? Oh, well, that's weird. I really don't get it. Maybe I should wait till tomorrow, then I will probably understand it.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thank you Hendrick for your valuable work! I will test Firebird and Phoenix parallel as soon as I can.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
In winter Amsterdam is at GMT+1 and in summer GMT+2. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I have never used this this kinda of system. Could some1 help walk me thru setting this up so I can start using it......I have metatrader thru the COES platform......I know its a pain to teach, but there must be some1 who likes to teach.....................................................

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You're using MetaTrader 4? If so, put the Phoenix_EA_v1_0.mq4 directory in your Experts directory. Put the Phoenix_IND_v1_0.mq4 in your experts\indicators directory. Start your trading platform software and they should show up under Custom indicators, and Expert Advisors. Attach the EA to a chart and let it run. I am letting mine run on the GBP/USD, EUR/USD, and USD/CHF with the default settings.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I'm using 240 and 60. Will adjust the manual. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi, Amsterdam is GMT+1, but with Day Saving Time it's now GMT+2. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
My COES platform only says only meta editor..maybe i dont have what I need?????? []You're using MetaTrader 4? If so, put the Phoenix_EA_v1_0.mq4 directory in your Experts directory.

Hendrick, Thanks for your work on this EA. What is the difference between 'account is micro' T/F, as far as how the EA functions? I trade micro lots in a mini account by using .1 to equal 1K lot. Currently I'm using the false option and it seems to work. Do you still need to have the chart set to the proper time frame? 15 min.?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Once you have installed the EA on the computer open MetaTrader. Then open the Navigator (the button at the top of MT with the folder and star) then you can see and attach the EA from the Navigator panel.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hendrick, Good luck trying to "extinguish" Firebird... it's a good EA except for the time when it gets crazy. I will watch this thread with much interest. Dane

--- 帖子 #21 ---
ok I have the navigator open and the Phoenix open, how do I attach it

--- 帖子 #22 ---
both firebird and Phoenix are in the big wondow when I open it......is it attached then..if so how do i get it to run

--- 帖子 #23 ---
OK my Coes platfaorm is Meta editor 4...Is that different from Meta trader

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Haha, lol, that's only the Editor to program your scripts, you will need it later for changing Phoenix or understanding how it's working. But for now, just click on Terminal in the icon bar. This will open the Terminal which is the core of MT. That's where you can start Phoenix. By the way, RTFM - just read the HELP in Terminal. This will help alot.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hendrick: So your from Netherlands? That's cool, so I never have to adjust the time settings of your scripts because I am from Germany. And...I always get the error: ERR_INVALID_TRADE_VOLUME (131). So I guess Phoenix's MM uses ordersizes like 0.25. Could you add an option to round (ceil) these position sizes. I gues I am not the only one here whose broker only allows 0.1 steps. Hendrick: I think I found a bug: PHP Code //=============== ADJUST LOTS IF YOU WANT TO GAMBLE (IDEA MarvinSK) if( WantToGamble == true ) { int ht = TimeHour ( LocalTime ()); if(( ht &gt;= GambleFrom ) &amp;&amp; ( ht &lt;= ( GambleUntil - 1 ))) { Lots = ( GambleFactor * subLotSize ()); } } what if you have the GAMBLE bool set to TRUE but the MM set to FALSE? Eventhough I disable the MM, it's still calling subLotSize() which means it's using MM. That's not right, is it?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hendrick, I have UseCloseSignal set to true. At 19:50 GMT it sold GBPUSD @ 1.8462. At 20:22 GMT is bought GBPUSD @ 1.8476. I thought with that parameter set to true that should not happen. Both positons are currntly open. Should that be set to false instead? Anybody else expereincing this? Edit: I just noticed one position is a Regular and one is a Surf trade. I think that might answer my question.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I'd like a clarification of this too. I've never used orders sizes other than .1, .2, .3 etc and full lots. I have some Phoenix orders open that are .48 and .43. Do all brokers allow that? If all do not allow it, there needs to be a mechanism to round to whole segments. Thx.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Here are the steps to install an EA. this one is Firebird, but Phoenix installs the same way... http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=135

--- 帖子 #29 ---
TX Scott I knew their was some1 that would come thru...you r the man............... But is the chart suppose to have the indicators on it from the phonenix program

--- 帖子 #30 ---
OK the chart has the smily face, so is ready to trade on its own. I guess??????.will it trigger it self

--- 帖子 #31 ---
what is the Phoenix_IN..... do we need that also in the meta trader

--- 帖子 #32 ---
The docs show that there are indicators, you can install in the indicator subdirectory of the expert directory and use, but they are not necessary to run the EA... thanks scott

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hey Scott, do we need the Phoenis _IN put in also, what is it ??????

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hendrick, if UseCloseSignal is set to true, should a Surf trade close out a regular trade and vice versa? I have one of each open in opposite directions on cable. I'm set to true, so not sure if it's acting properly. Thx

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Alsup, you don't need it. It's a visual. You're going to be a bit lost if you don't read the firebird thread and at least the phoenix manual. It's all there.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hey TX...I will read the manual

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Why do people dont want to read these days? Everyone want things to be spoonfed to them.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I have those same two trades on the GBP. The sell has since hit the TP. I do have two trades on USD/CHF that seem to have worked right. I have a Buy that was closed out at -8 pips and replaced by a Sell at the same time.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I have the chf sell active, but didn't get the long. Probably just a data feed difference. I'd still like to know if a surf trade closes a regular trade and vice versa and will probably find out by tomorrow from Hendrick.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Well I notice that Phoenix closes a trade when its opening a position in the other direction. I think this is a neat future. Firebird use to keep both positions open in both directions.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Yes, Yardie, and it looks like you can chage that back the other way if you set UseCloseSignal to false.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Well, we r all not as well read as u yardie. understanding this doens't come as east to some of us. Sometimes it takes DOING it to UNDERSTAND it...wish we were all as bright as u.........................maybe u can tell me why this will not take trade on my platform...Everything looks good , the smily face i s on...what an I doing wrong, sorry for asking to spoon fed again..............................

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hey Alsup no offense was intended buddy. its just that I get annoyed when people are asking questions that can be found in the manual etc. Do you see the smiley face on all your charts with the Phoenix label (top right hand corner). DO you have the charts set on the 15 minute time frame?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
BENQ I would advise you to keep it. I notice that Phoenix closes trades even if it hasnt it the TP or SL. I suppose it does this based on new signals received. This EA is definitely smarter than Firebird. I like it already.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes, it closes trades if a new one is signaled, which is good, I agree. But why doesn't it close a regular trade if a surf trade is opened? If a surf trade is initiated it means we're in a trend, so why shouldn't the original counter-trend close? UseCloseSignal is set to true, but it seems to have no effect on the regular versus surf trade scenario. I think I have to wait for Hendrick's answer on this to see how he intended it to be.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Ben. You're right. I have separated surf-orders from regular-orders. If you use UseCloseSignal=true it's only working for regular orders. In the next version I will make an extra option that's closing a regular oder if a surf-order for the same pair is going in the opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Hendirck, does the "gamblerfunction" overrules the MM? I mean if MM is active, is it then possible to take double (or more) orders in the "gamblerfunction"? Thanks, FT

--- 帖子 #48 ---
The MM function returns a certain lot-size. When using "WantToGamble" is true this lot-size is multiplied with the "Gamblefactor". So if your "Gamblefactor" is 3 and MM retruns lot-size 0.25 you will get a lot-size of 0.75.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi, Phoenix is not using the PipStep-function of Firebird. It was this function that made Firebird went crazy during News Events. Phoenix will act very different durings these events.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Yes... you are right. I will correct this in the next revision. I will also make a new option for those who get the error as mentioned above. Thanks.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Well, I started Phoenix yesterday soon after it was posted running 24 hours. It has closed 14 trades with 5 winners and 9 losers in a bit less than a 24 hour period. I'm a little suprised to see so many losers. Everybody get similar results? I'm running it on the majors plus USDCAD and EURJPY - 6 pairs total.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I've been running phoenix for about 12 hours or so on 24 hours and have had 9 trades total 8 closed with 6 winners 2 losers and 1 still open. I've only been running them on usdchf, gbpusd, eurusd, usdjpy, audusd, usdcad and I have to say I'm really impressed at this point. Great job Hendrick !!!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Not sure why you are getting such results. I am actually happy so far up +48 net pips since I launched it about 14 hours ago. I am using it on USDJPY EURJPY USDCHF EURUSD GBPUSD AUDUSD and USDCAD. Poorest performer so far has been USDCHF. My computer rebooted itself while I was asleep so the bot was basically off for a few hours. Not sure if this would make a difference either way.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Yes, being off for a few hours would definitely change the results. Here's mine so far.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Yeah, I know, I just get fraustrated cause this won't make a trade...I changed the charts to 15 min, I had them o n 1 hr...Dah, and the smiley and label r up in the corner....With that said, should it not start trading. I have live trading selected in the properties, what else do I need to do???????

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Ok here's what happens...Its trying to take the trades but down on the experts tab it keeps giving messages that theirs a error opening buy or sell with the number 4109 and 131.....how can I rectify this QUOTE=Yardie]Not sure why you are getting such results.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
My first day's results were similar. Running it GBP/USD, EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, USD/CHF, NZD/USD, USD/CAD. 11 winners and 9 losers on full 18/42 trades. 2 trades closed out on signal trade (1-1 on those. One down 8 pips, one up 2 pips). Net: -186 pips I have it trading 24 hours a day and have the Gambling turned off. I just want a larger personal sample to look at before making those kind of adjustments.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
What is it thats causing everyone to have different results? Is there something you need to change in order to set it up correctly?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
alsup - I'm also getting a whole list of "error opening buy order" messages in the experts tab. help!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
yeah, I'm confused. I've tryed to look for info, but to no avail...It would be nice if some1 would step up and guide me thru the weeds so to speak, and tell what I'm doing wrong

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Well different people have different settings. Its not the setup per se. My TP is 25 and SL is 40. Others have 18 Take Profit and 42 Stop Loss. So its all a matter of preference. Also my computer shut off while I was asleep so no trade was done for like 4 hours.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I think I might know what the problem is. What settings are you using?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I guess default, can u be more specific

--- 帖子 #64 ---
If you getting this error "error opening buy order" you probable have MM=true and your broker don't accept lot-sizes like 0.24. Set MM=false and change your Lots to something like 0.2.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
That was what I was thinking as well.. Glad to see I was on the right track.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
lot size is set at 1 as of now, is that accepable or should I change

--- 帖子 #67 ---
never had this problem with FXDD before. I think you're also using FXDD Hendrick, with server set at GMT+2. Also my lot size default is 1.0.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
by the way I'm getting the error on both buy and sell

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Alsup1955 you need to set the MM setting to false..and your problem will be resolved. You can put your lots at any value you want. I have my MM at false.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I changed it , hopefully it will start trading...TX Yardie

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I bet that is the problem I've been having too. I have Phoenix set up on my pc at home, and can check on the progress throughout the day, and haven't seen any trades trigger yet. I'm sure once it does, I'll need to tweak the settings some. I'm running it with the default settings right now. Has anybody changed any of the parameters yet?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I changed mine. I change lot size, MM=false Gamble=false TO ti 25 and SL to 40.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I hate to admit it, but I can't get this to run on my Version 4! I have tried putting it in the Experts file; downloading and compiling then saving...each time the Phoenix Expert shows up in the upper right hand corner with an "x" after it! Any thoughts??? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hey Hendrick, What about regular order closing surf order? I have a lot of hedged positions open right now. Regular order is going one way and surf order the other. On a bright note my surf orders record so far is 6-1.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Read and follow the instructions found here: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=135 You are missing a step or two. Make sure the EA is set to live trading and the Experts Advisor function is turned on.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Check to make sure your Expert Advisors button is pressed on the menu/tool bar on the top. The 'x' is an indication that Expert Advisors is not enabled.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
guys, thanks, I think that's sorted it.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hey Yardie Everthing looks good, but no trades are activading, is that because volume is about zero this time of day...It was doing trades prior to me changing the mm to false...........................

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Well, I am getting plenty of trades here, but I am also getting a lot of 131 errors in the experts tab. It sounds from pervious posts that that may be related to the MM feature. I guess I will start a new test with that feature disabled because that may be why I have so many losers.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yardie, are you trading 24 hours or using the tradefrom/tradeuntil feature?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I am testing the 24 hours time frame.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
It may be. I rather do my own Money Management. I am doing a fixed 0.5 lots on a 10K demo account. Will change as it get bettr.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Alsup if no trade is activated make sure your trading time settings is set for 24 hours. The manual has more information on that. Your settings should look like this: TradeFrom1=0 TradeUntil1=24 TradeFrom2=0 TradeUntil2=0 TradeFrom3=0 TradeUntil3=0 TradeFrom4=0 TradeUntil4=0

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Yardie, wouldn't .5 be lots be too much on a 10k account? You're trading seven pairs, right? Since a surf and a regular can be open at the same time, there's the potential for 14 positions being open.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Well, if he's using a leverage of 1:200 one miniLot is $50 so that means .5 lots is $250, right? And this times 14 equals 3500. Even a leverage of 1:100 would be enough.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hendrick is changing this in the next version.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
correction to my post quoted: I am not getting the 131 error on the platform that has the many losers. I am only getting that error on the SBFX platform.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
0.5 lot is $5 per pip. That is fine for me. Maybe aggressive for others though.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Yardie, I'm doing the 24 hour as well, although I do like the idea of the tradefrom/tradeuntil feature. Setting the times would be nice, but it seems like the other features should take care of the volatile periods -- the other features being the safearea, safedistance and safepipsminute features. Are you using 240/60? I just started another version with a tighter safearea of 40. 40 was used in the previous H version. Are you using 40 or the deaulted 50?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I've been watching the Firebird thread with some curiosity, but I just started demo trading using Phoenix today. So far I've had pretty good results, although one day isn't much to go on. I'm curious what time frame everyone is using. I pretty much left all the defaults alone for now as I am demo trading at +2 GMT on 15 minute charts. I'm testing many pairs. Appreciate any feedback. What I would love to see out of this system is the following, although admittedly it may be impossible to achieve. I would like to have the option of having the trade amount double after a loss on a currency pair. For instance say EUR/USD is stopped out at a loss and I had the trade amount set at .5. I would like the next trade on EUR/USD to trade 1 full lot. This is a strategy I use in manual trading that works pretty well. I actual double my lot size up to four times in a row. After that I must start over. Obviously to do this you must set the initial trading amount to 1/4 the size lot you can afford to trade according to your account. The nice part is that I can be wrong three times in a row and still become profitable overall on my 4th trade. Also, to work the profit amount must at least be over half the stoploss amount. So if stoploss is set at 42, the profit could be set at 25. This way the system can be wrong 75% of the time and we still end up profiting. I'm just throwing out possibilities to help improve the system. If this is not workable or other traders do not agree I shan't be offended. Thanks for your work on this Hendrick. I'm sure there are many others like me who have been watching these threads, but have yet to post. &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #91 ---
You should be fine with the M15. I think there's a couple people here working 30 minute charts (maybe lonespruce?). As far as TP and SL, change it to whatever you want. The default is 18/42, but if you've follwed the Firebird thread you'll see that many are on 25/50, 26/52, etc -- lots of different choices.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Ok, i've done all things that Yardie has said to do.....I have the smily face up in the corner. I,ve changed the mm to false. changed the time frame to trade 24 hours, then draged it back to the chart and it still will not make trades...Down on the experts tab at the bottom it says its been initialized //////////////// So please help???????????????????????????????

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Well, how long has it been since you've done all this now? I have some open trades, but have not had any new trades initiated in at least two hours. Conditions have to be right. If you've just done all this within the last 2 hours then it's no big deal. If you have no trades by morning, then I would suspect you still have an error somehwere. It doesn't just enter trades to be in the market.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
guess maybe I'm impatience, i want o see it work...Hey Ben does the trade show up under the trade tab in the bottom left when its makes the trade....Earier today it was trying to make trades and it was showing the errors under the experts tab....but was not activating the trades Tx Kevin

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I am using default for those settings.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I hope Hendrick release the new versions soon. I see orders opened in the same direction one by Phoenix regular the other buy Phoenix surf and both are losing in some cases.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
anyone have any early data on which pairs are working best? At the moment GBPJPY is losing most trades. I'm naturally wary of the spread on some crosses which will inevitably reduce profitability.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Can someone tell me if the InterbankFx 4 backtester is any good? I backtested Phoenix with standard settings on GBP 15min but got scary :surprised returns, like -$5500 for a month.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Benna, attached is IBFX backtest results of Phoenix v1.0 for almost 4 weeks, June 18, 2006 to today. You can see the settings in the report. The major change was tp=120 and sl=130. My local time is GMT -4. If you can get $3,000+ profit per month with $5000 deposit on Live acct., we will all be Wackena

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Yes, it shows up in trade tab. You should see a couple trades by now if you're set up correctly.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Overnight results: My version running 18/42 is about even overnight with 11 closed trades, 7 wins, 3 losses and 1 BE. The version running 25/50 is ahead nicely with 7 closed trades, 5 wins and 2 that were reversed, 1 at BE and the other for a small loss. The default version I had started on the 11th is behind quite a bit, still trying to make up for the many losses it had. Those early losses were posted a few threads ago.

22-18 so far. -354 pips 18/42 Gambling off Trading 24 hours Using on EUR/USD (4-2), GBP/USD (5-4), NZD/USD (4-1), USD/CAD (2-4), USD/CHF (3-4), EUR/JPY (3-3), EUR/GBP (1-0) That does include a few Close on Signal trades which are not the full 18/42 trades. Jonathan

8-7 think I'll go TP120 SL130.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Wackena, have you started forward testing these settings? If so, are you using the trailing feature to lock in profit or waiting for tp 120? I still have a version of G running with a sl of 120 that does pretty well, but never used that high of a tp with it.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Down in the experts tab it shows it trying to take trades but its says error taking buy: 131 helppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp

--- 帖子 #106 ---
What does the UseDivergence setting do? I see it defaults to false. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
What lot size are you using, and for which pair are you getting that error message? Are you getting any trades at all? And are you creating a template to make sure you're applying the same settings to all charts? Also, how many platforms are you running, and are you getting these errors on all the platforms?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I ended up in the red yesterday 11 wins 6 pseudo wins (positions closed before TP) and a whopping 13 losses. So far today I am 4 wins and zero losses (with one breakeven). I am going by the server time with my broker which is GMT +2.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
That's a "leftover" from Firebird. It calculates the trades differently. There's a doc in the firebird thread somewhere that explains all the old settings. Per Hendrick's request to keep it clean, I'm not going to post it in this thread -- you'll have to dig it out if you really want it. It's mentioned in the Phoenix manual.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
When is the newer version going to be released? As of right now it seems that nobody is really in profit. I'm in profit from yesterday but I didn't have it running all day and I manually closed my trades, none hit TP.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Wow, 13 losses is not pretty. By the way, Yardie, I was meaning to mention to you the other day about your computer rebooting itself and you missing a few trades overnight -- even though you missed a string of losers it could just as well been winners. To avoid that, place your platforms in your windows startup folder. Then if it reboots overnight, they automatically start up and continue trading. Works like a charm

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Another thing I've noticed about this EA is that all of my trades have gone into profit at one time or another. You could actually profit by scalping the EA. By this I mean manually closing your trades once they go a little ways into profit. Do this and trade with more than one lot and you could do very nicely.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Well, that kind of defeats the purpose of the EA, closing manually. The original firebird had a tp of 10 and sl of 120 and it closed profitable trades all day long. The pipstep is one of the things that killed it though. Phoenix doesn't have the pipstep. You can set your tp to whatever you want, so if you want to just scalp a few pips bring the tp down to whatver you want. Be careful though with your sl because obviously with a very low tp a lot of profitable trades can get wiped out with one stop -- another reason firebird would crash.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Well I was net -129 pips yesterday and with todays wins net -29 pips. Its on a demo so its ok. I want to see how the EA perform over time..a few days worth of trading is too little to use to judge. Thanks for the tip by the way.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
What are you using for your tp and sl? I set mine to what Yardie's is set at and when it's running, it's profitable, but I had to close my trades manually because I left the house for work.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
BenQ, I started forward Demo testing this morning. tp=120, sl=130, ts=0. At present, 1 early closed win (eur/usd) and 3 open orders ( 1 ea. eur/usd, usd/jpy, use/chf). I will start another Phoenix Demo. Same setup with ts=15. Wackena

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I think this setting would work IF Phoenixsurf and Phoenix regular would close each other out when they reverse a position. Otherwise you could find yourself with a lot of open orders in trending markets. Anyhow I am not break even for the past two days 5 wins and 1 pseudowin so far today.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I meant to type ts=15. Wackena

--- 帖子 #119 ---
You're not trading this live are you? This should only be on demo at this point. Hopefully you're on demo, so just leave it running 24/7. I'm running a couple different versions: one is default, another default but with a tighter safearea, and a couple with different tp and sl -- none with a tp less than 18 and none with a sl higher than 50.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
No it's not live, it's a demo account. I don't leave my computer running while I'm not at home.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
You did type ts=15 in the original post. You're talking about for the new demo you're starting today, or the version you're already testing?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
New demo. I will be testing side-by-side demos with only change in one to be ts=15. Wackena

--- 帖子 #123 ---
That will be interesting to have a trailing stop in conjunction with your TP=120. I may try the same. Please keep us posted with your results. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I have it set at 1 lot..I've tryed all 4 majors and I get the same error on all of them (Error opening buy order 131) ..I have not created a template but I'm sure all the setting r the same in all charts..Only running 1 platform with is Coes......................I,ve changed the mm to false and changed the time to 24hr, per the manual???????????????????? What else can I do

--- 帖子 #125 ---
alsup - try a different broker like FXDD.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
What a great day for Phoenix. See my statement. Seen the results for WantToGamble?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Can you copy and paste what your settings are set at? Are you manually closing your trades? Just curious because it seems like your doing a lot better than everybody else. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Awesome, just wish I could get this to work on my coes platform

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I don't get Hendrick's results. Wow. I think I give up....... Phoenix is handing me my ass for the last two days on all three demos. No special setups, very vanilla. Oh well. Just demo accounts. Ol' Don

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Here are my settings. As you see I don't use "UseSurf". I'm not satisfied about its performance. I'm still trying to find a good substitute for this. Stay tuned!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Try a different platform. I don't believe coesfx has their platform defaulted to autotrade. I tried their platform a couple months ago and it wouldn't trade either. I had to call them to turn it on.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thanks for the reply. Do you think your results would improve if you set you trade time to 24hrs? Or do you think it would hinder the results?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Don't give up Ol' Don! Try my settings and follow this thread. I'm sure Phoenix will get better every time.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Alsup, Are you on a live account? If not, try FIBO. I have Phoenix running on a demo account just fine, after turning off the MM feature and setting the Lots to 0.2

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hendrick, I wasn't aware you were not using surf. I thought you were since it's defaulted on. And I notice now that a lot of my losers were surf trades, so it will definitely make a differnece if it was turned off. I notice in your settings you have a new one, "round lots up" or something like that. That must be intended to correct the error some were getting with odd lot sizes. That's great, because we could then turn MM back on. When will you post the new version? And besides that change, have you made the change that a surf trade closes a regular and vice versa? Also, isn't there a way to transfer the settings someone posts directly into MT4 by copying it somewhere? I think I've read somewhere you have to change the extension of something. Does someone know how that's done. Thx.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I have a live acct with Coes and I did not want to change...I have followed the attempted trades by Phoenix manully and am doing pretty good...Probley closing the trades alittle early, but a profit is a proft................... Only bad thing is I have to sit an watch it .........................

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Ben, When I opened that text file, it loaded it into Notepad. I then saved that file under the experts\presets folder, with an extension of .SET Now if I want to use those settings, I just load them into the EA while attaching the EA to a chart.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Then just open a demo with someone else to test phoenix 24/7. You may find it's worth the switch. Isn't coes still clearing through cfg? If so, they're trading against you.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks, 4x, I knew there was a way to do that but wasn't quite sure of the whole "changing the extension thing" thanks.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Have mini acct. they have no desk, trading directly with the bank

--- 帖子 #141 ---
If you want to use my settings please be aware that the time-filters are for GMT+2 (these are Local Times). If you are in a differentt time-zone you have to convert these settings. Read the manual or just Google.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
My results are still good after two days of testing Phoenix on the 15m for multiple currency pairs. The pair that has caused the biggest loss thus far is GBP/USD which has had 3 wins and 3 losses. My initial thoughts are that this pair either needs a wider stop than the default 42 pips or perhaps it should be traded on a higher time frame like the 30m. Time will tell I suppose. I'm curious to know how others have faired on Cable. On the other hand, if my suggestion to have the ability to double lot sizes after losses (up to four times) was made available all three losses from cable would've been eliminated and my losses would be nearly zero. I have no idea if this is possible to implement, but if so, it is definitely a feature to consider as Phoenix grows and begins to soar!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
this is becoming a great thread. now - trailing stops. any thoughts on this, as it could help preserve any profits before an unfortunate swing to take out SL????? I'm trying TP120, SL130. tarjeel - are you suggesting martingale approach? could blow your account quite quickly if 5 or more trades go against you. lot-stepping would be a safer option. read the hedgehog thread which has a lot on this.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
CoesFX has a desk for minis. They clear through CFG, but have been working on a new relationship in the recent weeks. I have a contact there in that office that I speak to regularly. Their regular accounts are straight through, as is there model, but they're not set up for that yet on minis -- at least as of last week or so. When you login, are you logging in through a CFG server? They may have changed recently, but I kinda doubt it. Search this forum for coesfx and cfg and you'll see some earlier posts by myself and others to confrim this.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Does anybody know what GMT Strategybuilder MT4 is set at? Or would I use my local time zone?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
GBPUSD has accounted for most of my losers so far. I think I'll try H1 TF for this pair. I note Hendrick's statement had no cable trades!! How can you tell from the history which is a surftrade?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
SBFX is GMT +2. If you're talking about setting the tradefrom/tradeuntil, that uses your local time. If you want to convert Hendrick's time to yours, you need to do the conversion.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Let’s see if I got this right for Firebird version 2:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; When using MM=true some people get 131 errors because some brokers don’t accept lot-sizes like 0.24. So for those we have to use a RoundUp function that will roundup these lot-sizes to the nearest integer (0.24 gets 0.2. 0.26 gets 0.3 and so on).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; There was a bug when using MM=false and WantToGamble=true. In that case lots were calculated by MM although MM was false.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MM is not working as it should for MicroAccounts. I’ve discovered a different piece of code for Money management. It’s based on the idea that after some losses Lots will decrease. I like this.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; If using UseSurf=true Surf orders where opened while a Regular order for the same pair in a different direction was still open. Some of you want to have the possibility to close these orders. I will not implement this because I’m not satisfied about the performance of “UseSurf”. I’m working at a different technique to “switch” &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; from a counter-trend EA to a Trend-follower EA during a trending/volatile market.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is doing very well in a ranging market (the best I’ve seen until now). We can two things: prevent &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; to place trades in a trending market (on the long run, a year or more, &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; will make money) or to switch &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; to a trend-follower EA if the market changes from ranging to trending. Please give me some feedback. If you have any addition, please let me know! &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I will post version 2 of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; this weekend. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Use your Local time. Hendrick is GMT+2, I'm GMT-5, so I subtract 7 from Hendrick's settings. e.g. if Hendrick's Gamble time is 16 to 17, I would put in 9 to 10 for my time zone.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
OK, thanks for the help. My local time is GMT -5. So I would just -7 from all of Hendricks times correct?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Well one of the best ways I've found to confirm a trend has been the HAT indicators (see thread). If you could code into phoenix to follow the trend when the bar goes above or below T3 that would change it nicely into a trend-follower. see the HAT thread.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
LOL, thanks for the explanation. You actually answered my question before I asked it.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
this business about timings still isn't clear to me. Are we going by the broker or by local??

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I was told to go by your local time zone.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Thanks a lot for this. I will look at it.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
HAT method also gave a lot of false entry points. It is more of a visual confirmation than an entry/exit signal.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Well, why do you say after a year or more, Phoenix will make money? Why would it take so long to make real money? So when do you think v2 will be available? And yeah, I have an addition: Could you enable the trade to set TrailingAct &amp; TrailingStep? I think right now it's using TrailingAct = TrailingStep and you call it Trailingstop. In my version, I implemented these two vars. + TrailingStop as boolean - you can toggle if you want TrailingStop. If you want I can give you some code for this. And by the way, I really like Tarheel's suggestion to double the traded amount after a loss. I mean, it's really easy to implement (especially in Phoenix) and you can just use a bool to toggle it.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hello everybody, regarding this timezone thingy... i am using MT4 with interbankfx and the localtime() function used within the PheonixEA does not return my localtime, it returns the server time. isn't this wierd ??? AZBOfin

--- 帖子 #159 ---
If the martingale approach is implemented it should have the option to not use it. People kill accounts using that method.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I get the 131 error either way false or true 1, .2 does not matter

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Oh, yeah, of course, it must have a boolean to control it (as said in my last post). Well, I think as Phoenix / firebird has so few losers, it shouldn't be to big of a problem. I mean, we can just do it till you have the amount quadrupled or doubled. However, I think it worth consideration. It's kind of a gambling function though and only for people with deep pockets.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
If you can't resolve the problem, just wait till Hendrick is releasing the next version. However, do you have GAMBLING, MM and SURF and maybe AccountMicro set to FALSE? I think because of a bug you have to disable all these functions, they are all using the MM-function (even if you disable it). I already told Hendrick about this bug. BUT, JUST READ the whole thread - SOOOO many of your questions are already answered right here!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Trading Report Phoenix EA v1.0 / Demo Account / InterbankFX EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, USDJPY (all on 15 min charts) Trading Hours: all day MM=on Gamble=off, Surf=on Percent=0.1, Risk=2, TP=18, SL=42 The attached statement shows profit/loss in pips for all closed transactions. The biggest change I made to the default settings are: Percent = 0.1 (original 0.05), Risk = 5 (original 5) The widening of the envelope from 0.05 to 0.1 does reduce the number of trades. That's why I probably don't have any trades for the euro so far. AZBOfin

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I don't understand you. Phoenix is just a couple of days old.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Well, this seems to happen every time someone offers some help with a indicator or a system or a method or ect... Hendrick has been more than kind to program this EA and to support it. You have my gratitude Hendrick. There are always some people that just do not get that something freely given need not be trashed. I think we need to raise the level of respect here for Hendrick's fine work. Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Alsup, you have to follow the suggestions people are trying to give you or just stop asking. Sorry to be so blunt. But I've told you that coesfx does not default their platform to autotrade. I know this from personal experience. Either call them and switch it, or simply go to any other broker and just download another platform. I'm not saying fill out paperwork and open an account, just download the demo -- takes 30 seconds. www.strategybuilderfx.com has the download button front and center on their homepage. Just download it and try running phoenix on it. If it works, at least you've narrowed your problem down a bit. Start with the same settings you're trying to use now. MM= false, etc.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Yes I agree with smjones. My hats off to you Hendrick, YOU ARE THE MAN !!!! Thank you for your hard work and I look forward to following this thread. Again many thanks !!!!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I completely agree. It's not easy work and neither is answering a ton of questions.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I second that Scott. Everyone has been awesome in helping me figure this out...Tx to all of u......Even thou I have not got it working yet, I still apprieate the attempt to help......u guys r the besttttttttttttttt

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Has anyone been running a version of Phoneix or Firebird with a safearea below 40? I'd be curious to know your results. Thx.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I thought you meant that it would take Phoenix a year to make real money, running 24/7. I didn't think that he meant the development would take a year. Hm...what did you mean now ? The reason I asked then was that I couldn't imagine that Phoenix (which is really on of the best TradingSystems I know) would take a year to make some money.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Well, you could backtest it of course only if you have some reliable data. Look at http://www.metatrader.info/node/67 to get some tips from CodersGuru.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
suggestiom taken............................................

--- 帖子 #174 ---
The backtesting results that I get are never in the positive but from forward testing it I have stayed in profit.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I am having a good day so far today as well. 12 wins 2 pseudo wins and 3 losses for +227 net pips. Hendrick I notice that you have no Phoenixsurf orders listed on your statement. Do you have this function disabled?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Very nice job! I think he said he had phoenixsurf disabled, not 100% certain though. If you go back a page or two he attached his settings.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I looked, he has it disabled.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Oh, well. That's kinda strange. I guess it depends on the fact that there are no ticks in the hst-files? I don't know. However, it's much better if you get bad results in BT and good one in FT not the other way around, right?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Mine did well today too. I had 13 wins/3 losses. All losses were surf trades. I might disable that as well.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
That is smart. Just checked my history. I would have avoided 9 of my 16 losses so far without that feature. Thats 360 pips more I would have had right about now. I think I should disable it as well. Ironically it is responsible for 9 of my 23 wins as well. But its a net loser.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
It's really to bad that Surf doesn't work YET. However, I tried to code that kind of self-adjusting TradingSystem, too and many other people, I guess. It's really hard to get that to work. Hopefully, we can suceed at that

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I think the surf function would be able to work better if surf orders can close regular orders and vice -versa. Hendrick says this will be in the next version. In the mean time I have disabled it. All my losses today at surf losses. And 6 of 13 losses yesterday were surf losses as well.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yardie, Was that +227 for the week or for the day?? Either way, that's awesome! Congrats

--- 帖子 #184 ---
It sounds like figuring out a way for phoenixsurf to function better would be the biggest benefit to this EA. I'll read about what exactly it does and see if I can come up with some ideas when I get home.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Mine are about the same. If we disable surf, the other anti-trend protections are still safearea and the safepipsdistance combo. I've started two more demos. One with a smaller safepipsminute and the other with a safearea of 30.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
This might be a dumb question but how can I run more than one demo? Do I have to download strategybuilder more than once, or is there a way to run more than one demo from the same platform?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Ok, I'm getting aliitte, no ALOT to cnfused...I took your suggestion and had Strategybuilder platform up,and loaded the Phoenix, changed the mm to false, and guess what,,,I still get that error 131...It just keeps trying to open trades and spits out the error message..........I'm completely lost WAY TO WEIRD

--- 帖子 #188 ---
It all sounds that no one here is relying on Backtesting, why is that? Is that really so bad? I guess I shouldn't backtest anymore then Hendrick, how are you testing your Phoenix, you don't always forwar-test each little detail you change, do you?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Its gotta be something simple, but for the life of me I must be a complete idiot....Never has this kinda problem before

--- 帖子 #190 ---
For today. +58 for the week. Yesterday was a bad day.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Alright, what about drinking a coffee or a beer? And then just chill down. After tomorrow or the day after you won't get these errors any more, I guess. So till then you can use you time in better ways then trying to get that EA to work!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Alsup post all your settings here so we can take a look.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Have you been getting positive backtest results? The reason I'm not backtesting is because when I backtested I was in loss but from forward testing it I've been in profit. I've also read many mixed reviews on the reliability of backtesting. Can you post your backtesting results?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Backtesting is usually unreliable. Forwardtesting is the way to go.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yeah, alright, it's just taking sooo much time. But if it's not working otherwise Man, this thread is really working like a chat room - there are so many msg's - it's only hard for new people to filter the important msg's out of these hundreds.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Yes, if you're not in here from the beginning, it's tougher to jump in and catch up. The collaboration here is great. There are so many different combinations of options and too many demo accounts to keep track of.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Yeah, that's true. Hedrick should really be proud of himself that he initiated one of the most active thread on the whole forexFactory platform! Thanks Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
There's a couple ways to do it. Either install the platform again in another folder, or download another platform from someone else. I like the other folder option best because then you can run exact side by side comparisons. If you run one platform against another from someone else, sometimes the data is a bit off and one will enter a trade and the other not.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Heres my settings, what do u think In order =10; =15 =1 =false =false =120 =60 =0.05 =50 =5 =18 =42 =0 = true =0 =24 =0 =0 =0 =0 =0 =0 = true =16 =17 =2 = false = false =23 = price_open =84 = price_open = 0.0011 = 0.0079

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Alsup, Your settings look fine to me. The problem may be with your broker. Are you having the same problem with StrategyBuilder?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I always wonder what TimeFrame I should use :/ . 5M or 15? or maybe even 30M. And should I change the MA_TF then, too? That is all so hard to decide

--- 帖子 #202 ---
yes, its doing it on Coes and stragery builder................so it cant be the brokers,,,what else could it be

--- 帖子 #203 ---
is there some1 who knows what error 131 really means. Maybe some programmer out there ?????????????????????????????????????

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Have you ever had any EA working? Here's my suggestion: remove any EA from your charts. Start with an absolutely clean chart, probably best to just open a new chart. Then attach one of the stock EA's that come with MT4. Open up several different pairs and put it on each. Then wait a couple hours and you should have something trigger. Do this with both platforms, coesfx and SBFX. Make sure you have the smileys, and you should see something soon. Let's start here.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
TX Ben, ur the man, I'm now determined.................................

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yeah, of course, we know that! Look into stderror in MetaEditor for explanation. There are pretty much all errors listed. I attached it. EDIT: I see, you solved the problem. FOR EVERYONE: Please keep this file for questions later. Please don't ask us again. Just look into the file. And it's already included in MetaTrader, it's in "experts/include/stderror.mq4". BTW, don't you think we should start a new thread for Support of Phoenix. For my part, I think it's really annoying to have all these support Question/Answers in one thread together with the real stuff. I think we MUST start a new thread because if this thread stays so active (I think It's gonna be even more active) there gonna be soo many support posts that no one can find the really important posts. Even if one of the "core" members of Phoenix will never find through all these hundreds of posts which were made while he was on vacation for example. And for all the newcomers it's annoying, too. I remember, I saw the Firebird thread soo long ago, but I didn't want to look through this whole thread because there were so many unimportant posts. So I decided to skip the Firebird thread. Fortunately, I came back weeks later... Just give some feedback.

Phoenix uses 2 indicators to calculate the order entry point. One is the Moving Average indicator and it uses the MA_timeframe and Ma_lenght from the input settings. The 2nd is the Relative Victor Index this uses the TimeFrame (period) you select on the chart; ie, M1 M5 M15 M30 &amp; etc. So it does make a difference which chart timeframe you select. I think most use M15 for Phoenix. I'm using M15, but I like M5 when I am running Firebird. After I test M15 on Phoenix for awhile, I will then test M5 and other timeframes. Wackena

Guys So, invalid trade volume is error 131.........Does that refer to the lots in the settings

--- 帖子 #209 ---
It probably means your Broker won't accept Lot sizes in 2 decimal points. Until Hendrick get version 2 released with the Lot rounding function, you may need to enter Lot size with single decimal point (example 0.2). Hope this helps. Wackena

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yeah, of course, it refers to the lots it wants to trade . Hehe, well, there are so many posts here that 2 or 3 new ones were created while I was changing my post. So here it is again:

alsup1955, Actually, that's not the case. CoesFX has a relationship with a company called CFGTrader to handle clearing for all their mini accounts. I assume you signed up through StrategyBuilderFX. If you have a standard account through them, then you are trading directly with CoesFX. Any broker who offers direct interbank trading with mini's is not being accurate. The Interbank market is a standard lot market. Someone has to aggregate all those orders together and send them along. CFGTrader uses a dealing desk to do it. Regards, stockwet

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I did not sign up with str builder.. I,m with a group called Global one group who has a speical situation, ( they say)..........but who knows

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I am using MIG ( http://www.migfx.ch ). They have pretty low spreads : 2 pips on EUR / USD, USD / JPY, AUD / USD, EUR / GBP, EUR / CHF, CHF / JPY and 3 pips on GBP / USD, USD / CHF, USD / CAD, EUR / JPY. In addition, they are real-swiss. (not a company based somewhere else and everything says Swiss on there homepage) And, they guarantee these pips in normal conditions, but I'v never seen higher ones. And the don't have a dealing desk, high liquidity, etc. Just look on their homepage . I don't recommend them (hehe for the forum rules) but I like them.

Yardie, how has your AUDUSD been performing with phoenix? I'm considering adding another pair to my basket.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
NOt many trades on that pair..only two so far..one partial winner (18 pips) and one loser (40 pips).

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Easy, Once you have installed it, just go to where its installed and copy the folder into a new one, then create a new shortcut to the terminal.exe Create a new demo account, and away you go. I'm currenty running 5 tests and 1 Live, but you need Ram. 512k is enough for 6 tests, but will become sluggish and cache more. Mono

Thanks for the help. I was actually just doing that when I read this post.

I'd like to try pheonix on the 30 min timeframe with a 30 pip take profit, nit sure about the stop. I tested the 63G on the 30 min with a 300 pip stop and managed 50% for the month with no losses at all. it was only down 1% in open orders when my demo account expired. Doh!!! I thought i had longer. Now i can't access the statement. I am using strategy builder now since it doesn't expire. My main question is. In order to use pheonix on a higher time frame with a bigger stop loss, what other settings should I use. i am looking into it myself but if anyone has some suggestions it would help. out of all my tests the 30 min was the only one that was consistently profitable, but in a strong trend it may be the opposite. A 300 pip stop is pretty huge. I'd really like to do a comparison running 63G on one and phoenix on the other. My 63G settings are as follows: MA_length=10 MA_timeframe=30 MAtype=0 Percent=0.10000000 TradeOnFriday=1 slip=100 Lots=0.40000000 TakeProfit=30 Stoploss=300 Fast_Period=23 Fast_Price=1 Slow_Period=84 Slow_Price=1 DivergenceLimit=0.00200000 Use_V63D_Divergence=0 PipStep=30 IncreasementType=0.00000000 DVLimit=10 PipsGoal=500 PipsLoss=500 GMT=0 DST=0 OpeningHour=0 ClosingHour=24 writelog=0 Wiz.

Hi Wiz Im testing it with the settings below. Mono

I don't think safearea is working properly. I have a version running with a tighter safearea set at 30. A short trade fired off on EURJPY when it was clearly out of bounds. Anybody else notice this on any instrument? And I do have my safearea parameter set to 30. The trade occured at 04:15 GMT+2.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Ben, Very weird. I saw the same happening only with EURJPY. I think I have resolved the problem now. This may sound very stupid but how can I edit my first post? I want to attach version 1.1 to that post but I cannot discover any option for that!! Version 1.1 Is uploaded in the first post - Use the setting RoundupLots=true if your broker don't accept Lots like 0.24. - Is now working for MicroAccounts - Corrected a problem with GambleNow and MM - SafeArea was not working for EURJPY. Now it does.&lt;!-- / message --&gt;&lt;!-- attachments --&gt;

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hendrick, Apparently the edit function only lasts for a short time and moves with the new posts you place. Maybe I can help. If you post it in your current post, because I am a moderator I can overide the restriction and put it in the first post... let me know, scott

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi, Much obliged. I've attached version 1.1 with some text in my previous post.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Yeahaaa! Wohooo! Finally v1.1 . Thank you so much Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Look at this, guys. It's a backtest on EURUSD; all the details are on the statement. If this worked....WOW. Too bad that BT is really not reliable... In BT it works so much better without CloseSignal, anybody else experiencing problems with that?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
There seems to be a lot of confusion about the time-filters used in Phoenix. So I made a manual with some explanation and how to convert the time-filters to your own time-zone.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks Hendrick! Phoenix is doing pretty well today (until now) 3-0 (3 floats, net +1.5pips). Anybody running Firebird? How is that doing? Hendrick, are you running Ph./FB. on a live account? Is anybody experiencing differences between running on demo and on live (except your emotion ) ?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Well that is pretty easy. Thanks Hendrick

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Did you run this with default settings?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
look at the statement, it states my settings I think.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
It doesn't get any easier than that. Thanks Hendrick!!! Also many thanks for v1.1 of Phoenix. I think I can speak for all of us that we really appreciate your time and efforts you put into this EA!!!!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I think the last time you have listed in the manual should be 16 instead of 15?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi everyone, Did anybody leave Phoenix running during the BOJ rate hike to 0.25%? Particularly anybody have it running with UseSurf turned on? Mine was turned off, and it took a couple beatings with the usd/jpy and the eur/jpy. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I think Hendrick is right, Ben. His last pair was from 19 to 21, which would be 13 to 15 for U.S. Eastern time. (Subtracting 6 from Hendrick's time zone, not GMT)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. I was looking at my own chart when I wrote that. I thought I had seen in an earlier post that Hendrick's last pair was 19-22. I didn't notice the manual was different. My apologies.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hendrick, First, thanks for all your hard work on Phoenix. Secondly, I'm trading with FXDD and their "chart time" is +3GMT. What is your "chart time" relative to GMT? Will others need to adjust their times due to their Broker's "chart times". Alan

--- 帖子 #237 ---
It just happened on USDCAD as well. A long triggered at 14:45 GMT+2 while safearea (set at 30) was out of bounds. Will the fix in the new version take care of all pairs for this error? Thx

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Ben, Very interesting this. Did you see if it was far out of bounds or just a little bit? Keep me posted on this issue if you want. Thanks.

Hi Alan, Please read this: http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=226

What does 'Accountismicro' do, when should you use it? I trade micro lots by entering .1 lots in the order entry window. When I answer true to 'Accountismicro' I get an 'invalid lots number for order send function' error. If I enter false to 'Accountismicro' it seems to work OK. It places the order for .1 or a 1K lots as I requested in the 'Lots' number.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hendrick, I was wondering if in your next version you can include the old "trade on friday option". I don't know if something like that is difficult to add in or not, but if it could be done I'd appreciate it. Thx.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I think he already attached the new version to the first post. Is he going to come out with another?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I think it's very important for EVERYONE in here to know some basics in MQL4 (the language which is used to code EAs). I don't mean everybody should be able to make own working EAs but should be able to understand easy parts or most parts of Phoenix. Just look into it, google for "MQL4 howto" or sth. It pretty easy to understand. Then you don't have to ask other people to explain what simple structures in the Phoenix EA do. You would just open the EA in MetaEditor and read the (for you) important lines of code. If you still don't know what it is doing you can still ask of course. However, most of MQL4 is really easy, you can just read it like normal language and understand it. Hendrick is writing pretty userFriendly, too. So let's go, and try to understand Phoenix's code a bit better. BTW, I would never ever use an EA with real money if I don't understand how it is working (not every detail but in general).

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hendrick, Let me start by thanking you again for your work Phoenix to life. I'm not trying to be disrespectful to you, but I believe you didn't fully answer the question I posted. I'm somewhat new to EA's in general. Do they take their timing from the PC's system time, or from the broker's trading software time source? IF the Phoenix EA it gets it's timing from the PC's system clock , your previous post is sufficient to get the Phoenix software timing synchronized for the timezone differences from GMT. However, IF the EA clock and the times reported on the reports and charts are taken from the broker's clock time (NOT necessarily GMT time), other people's results could be wildly different from yours. I.E., my broker is FXDD and they are +3GMT. And all the timings of the events on the FXDD system (including charts and reports) do indeed reflect that. Perhaps this is why on the Firebird thread, people were always getting wildly different results. So, when you are reporting the most profitable times to trade, they should be in GMT time so everyone can compensate appropriately. Otherwise, people are very likely to get wildly different results from yours even with the GMT time differences taken into account. Respectfully yours, Alan

--- 帖子 #245 ---
anyone else trying a trailing stop?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi Alan, Phoenix uses local time. Hendrick's time zone is GMT+2. When you're figuring out his trading times, or his gamble times, convert his time zone to yours, and adjust your settings file accordingly.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
4x4tx, "Local time" meaning the our "PC's clock time" or local to the Broker? Alan

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I believe it is your PC clock time. That is how I understood the docs. Thanks Scott

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Scott, Thanks, is this true of all EA's? Being a computer geek, I find it peculiar that a process that runs within the framework of the MetaTrader doesn't take it's time from the broker's sytem, unless MetaTrader acts like a standalone piece of software that doesn't try to correlate it's time with the broker's system time. Alan

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hendrick based his time choice off what he found to be the most profitbale times to trade. What you can do is open tradin for 24 hours a day and decide what times work best for YOU. You might come up with something different.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Well Mr or Ms Sleuth, You have out sleuthed me. You might want to ask that question to SosoBeton, He is the Moderator of the MT4 forum here.. LOL Scott

--- 帖子 #252 ---
For you..I do this! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I understand what you're saying. Given the extensive experience he has with this software, I'm sure that Hendrick knows the best trading times. I wasn't implying that he didn't. Alan

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Sorry Alan, but I can't explain it more clearly than I did in the last manual I posted. It's all there I think!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
In order to clear up the confusion that others are having you can post what your broker GMT time is set at. This way they can set there trades from your broker time and then from you local time and figure out for themselves which is more profitable. I hope that made sense.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Yes.... That's what I tried to explain all the time. Thanks mate.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
well maybe I've got my time settings all wrong, because my demos are all losing big-time. One pheonix with hendrick's settings and surf off, with -2 for the hours (I'm in UK so GMT - but I do wonder about british summer time which we are in now, ie. GMT+1, so maybe my settings should be Hendrick-1). another pheonix running 24hours with TP120 SL130 a firebird63G with Wackena settings and a 63F. all losing. patience will be key, as looking at firebird a lot of trades take a few days to close.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
You're the best, Hendrick. Thx.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Not a good day for Phoenix today. 5 wins 4 pseudo-wins and 6 losses so far.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Most likely because it's Friday. The optional friday trading will be a good feature to have on the new version.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Before I start my holydays Wednesday next week I will try to finish version 1.2 of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. It’s my intention to remove the Surf function completely as I’m not satisfied with the performance of it. Apart from that I think it’s after all not a good idea to try to make an EA that’s suitable for a ranging as well as a trending market. I think it’s better to focus on the fact that &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is a counter-trend EA that’s doing very well in a ranging market. We better try to improve &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; insofar that it avoids the trending markets and gets the most out of a ranging market.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; How to improve &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Avoid a trending/volatile market: I think SafePipsDistance and SafeArea are doing quit well. We maybe need a little tweaking.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Avoid trading during certain parts of the day: The TradeFrom/TradeUntil will do.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Money management is another issue. How to deal with loosing trades? There are 3 different approaches:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is using a money management function were the number of lots is based on the free margin of your account. If the free margin decreases so will the number of lots and vice versa.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; After a loosing trade you open a new trade for the same pair and you increase your lots with the intention to level out the first loosing trade. If the second is a loser too you increase your lots again. So with a TP=25 and SL=50 and Lots=1 you get the following summary:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; First trade 1 lot looser -50&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Second trade 2 lots looser -100&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Third trade 4 lots looser -200&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Fourth trade 8 lots looser -400&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Fifth trade 16 lots and so on.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The idea behind this is that after a couple of losers for the same pair it becomes more and more unlikely that the following trade is a loser too. I’ve never tried this approach, but I like the idea.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The third approach is to decrease the number of lots after a couple of losers in a row (for different pairs). The idea behind this is that the EA apparently arrived in a less suitable period and have to wait for better times. Only after a couple of winning trades the number of lots will increase. I think we have sufficient options for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; to avoid these less suitable periods so we leave this approach for what it is.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I think I will add the second option (increase the number of lots after a loosing trade) to the next version of &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; for those who want to user this.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; At the end of every week I study all the trades that were made by &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. This is very useful and I’ve noticed that all the JPY-pairs need a different approach. I will tell you more in my next post.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; This weekend I will make a new version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, test it on Monday and post it Tuesday. Stay tuned!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #262 ---
By extending the Comment function (around line 330) one can see the current calculated time. ,"\n","Local Time= ",TimeHour(LocalTime()),":",TimeMinute(LocalTime() ), " Server Time= ",TimeHour(CurTime()),":",TimeMinute(CurTime()) In my case this is what i get: Local Time: 16:15 Server Time: 18:15 Time in the Market watch window: 18:15 My computer's local time (system clock): 09:15 I am running the PhoenixEA on a SBFX demo account and all time calculations are based on GMT (localtime() = GMT). I don't know why, but that's how it is. In my case LocalTime() &lt;&gt; local time. the localtime() functions returns always GMT. AZBOfin

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Oh the Martingale thing (doubling after each loss) is a recipe for disaster IMO. I think the Phoenix Surf function can be useful if you program Phoenix Regular to close those positions when it open a new position (and vice versa).

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Wednesday was worse though. But then I had Phoenix Surf enabled.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I agree, Martingale has never proven to be successful. This has been tried many times in Las Vegas at the roulette table. We could add it though and see how it operates. With the option to turn it off.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Now wait a minute here. the reason Martigale is not successful in LV, is because all games of chance in LV are negative expectancy. The Casino always has an edge and the table limit prevents Martingale from over coming the Advantage I am not a fan of the Martingale approach, but it is mathematically sound in a fair game and even more so in a positive expectancy game... The real problem lies with do you have enough money to wait out incredible bad luck in a row. Scott

--- 帖子 #267 ---
AZBOfin. I cannot yet decipher what all this means in relation to my question, however you're on the right track to providing an answer to the question I posed. You recognize that our PC's time, displacement from GMT time and our broker's time are likely to all be different and the source to the EA's timing is critical to know in order to evaluate the best times to trade on my PC with my broker and my displacement from GMT. Much thanks to all of you who have taken the time to respond, Alan

--- 帖子 #268 ---
This is the point I was trying to get at. Most people go bust before they are given the opportunity to get their money back.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi alan, This is my advice: let Phoenix run for 24 hours a day for lets say 1 or 2 weeks. In your History you will find all the trades and the times they were opened. Make yourself an overview of all the trades, their opening times and if they were winning or losing trades. Then you can determine which times are the most suitable for Phoenix to place trades. I wish you a lot of pips and keep me posted!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Alan, I and others are probably thoroughly confused by what you are asking. Here are two possible, direct questions. Which one is right? 1. What are the best times to trade the system? 2. How do I convert Hendricks default times to align with my own timezone? Both questions have been answered in various places. I think Hendrick gave a good answer to the first. Since this is a new EA, let it run and see when the best times to trade are. The second answer has been answered here and in the manual found on the first post. It is also answered by looking at the code itself. MetaTrader provides two time functions - CurTime() and LocalTime(). The first will get the current time from the server you're connected to. The second gets the time from your local computer's system clock. Hendrick configured the expert such that the time periods you put in should be aligned to your local system clock. Hendrick also stated that he is on GMT +2. I am on the East Coast, which is GMT -4 (usually -5, but it's daylight savings.) To get my settings aligned with the time periods Hendrick trades I would subtract 6 (2+4) from each of his trade start values. If your question wasn't related to this, then I apologize. I'm having a bit of trouble understanding what you are looking for. Regards, stockwet

--- 帖子 #271 ---
stockwet: in general i agree with everything you're saying, except: in my case localtime() DOES NOT return my computers local time. localtime() returns GMT. i'm taking now hendrick's advise by letting the EA run 24 hours. i then analyze the history to find the best trading times for me. AZBOfin

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hendrick, If I read the code correctly in Phoenix v1.1, if using Micro account and MM that calculates, using 5% Risk, the lot size to 0.025, then the code below will return LotMM=0. lotMM = MathRound(lotMM*10)/10; MathRound(0.025*10) will return 0. You might consdier using the NormalizeDouble() function to round the lots. You can set number of decimal points needed. if(Lots&gt;0.1) Lots=NormalizeDouble(Lots,1); else Lots=NormalizeDouble(Lots,2); Is my assumption above correct and could this code be useful? Wackena

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello Hendrick, First post for me and let me tell you , you are doing a heck of a job! Thank you very much for putting in all the time and effort to make this available to us and moreover thanks for taking the time to answer all our dumb and some not so dumb questions ;o) Also to some of the other guys that are supporting this thread and are being extremely helpful and patient with newbies like me ... Thank you! Really I mean THANK YOU, I read these posts and see how regular forum readers are also so very helpful to everybody. I have been following this thread and have implemented version 1 in Metatrader 4. Everything was running fine and I had the little smiley face on the top right hand corner ... however now that version 1.1 is available I tried to run that and I am getting a little X in the place of the smiley face. I have tried for the last three hours, whatever I could and I just can't get it to run. What am I doing wrong or am I forgetting something? Please Help.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hendrick, it looks dense, but it works. Gives the ability to set trading day and 4 trading times for each day. It would be possible to set trading schedules around events. Also, I've found that for the last 4 Fridays, I've had majority of loses. In backtesting and forward testing this week, not tradng on Thursday and Friday has made a big difference to bottom line profits. extern int Sunday = 1; // 0 = trade off, 1 = trade on extern int Monday = 1; extern int Tuesday = 1; extern int Wednesday = 1; extern int Thursday = 1; extern int Friday = 1; if( (DayOfWeek()==0 &amp;&amp; Sunday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4)))) || (DayOfWeek()==1 &amp;&amp; Monday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4)))) || (DayOfWeek()==2 &amp;&amp; Tuesday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4)))) || (DayOfWeek()==3 &amp;&amp; Wednesday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4)))) || (DayOfWeek()==4 &amp;&amp; Thursday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4)))) || (DayOfWeek()==5 &amp;&amp; Friday==1 &amp;&amp; ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart1) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd1))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart2) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd2))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart3) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;=(TradeHourEnd3))) || ((h &gt;= TradeHourStart4) &amp;&amp; (h &lt;= (TradeHourEnd4))))) { DealTime=1; } Have a great Holiday next week.

Yes. Did you make sure that the tab enabling Experts is Green at the top of the MT4 platform? Also, check out this thread it applys to Firebird but is also about the same proceedure for Pheonix. http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=135

Great thread! Learned alot from reading Firebird and Phoenix threads all the way thru today. I have a quick question which has probably been answered but I could not pinpoint it looking back. On the settings for the indicator the two levels (default to 50/-50) come from your "safe area" setting, correct ? Also, under Inputs is a variable called PC with a value of 6. What value is this ? Thx.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
look for this line of code in the indicator source: dResult=iBullsPower(NULL,0,20,PC,pos)+iBearsPower(NULL,0,20,PC,pos); PC describes the type of closing price used for the bulls/bears calculation. these are the numeric codes: &lt;table class="docenums" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" height="176" width="387"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_CLOSE &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 0 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Close price. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_OPEN &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Open price. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_HIGH &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 2 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; High price. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_LOW &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 3 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Low price. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_MEDIAN &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 4 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Median price, (high+low)/2. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_TYPICAL &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Typical price, (high+low+close)/3. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; PRICE_WEIGHTED &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Weighted close price, (high+low+close+close)/4. &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt; now check the source code for the EA: iTE=iBullsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL,0,20,6,0) make sure all parameters are the same otherwise the indicator displays not the correct values.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Mine has this iTE=iBullsPower(NULL,0,13,6,0)+iBearsPower(NULL,0,13,6,0); How come yours is different , using a 20 ? Did you manually change it or did some other value change that value ? Also, what value does the 13 and the 6 refer to. thx

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I have a moron question but how do I get the version 1.1 EA to show up. All the other EA's are ex4 and this is MQ4 and not showing up?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Put it into your expert subdirectory, not the indicators. AFter doing that you should restart your MT4 workstation.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
yes, i did change it manually so the EA and indicator both match. 13 is the number of periods for the calculation 6 is a code and means that the weighted close price is used (high+low+close+close)/4. AZBOfin PS: made a mistake in my previous post in regards to the 'pc'. it's edited now.

Hi Guys, I've been testing 2 phoenix settings this week. "Phoenix 30-300" has a W/L of 11/0 with 6 floats "Phoenix default" has a W/L of 72/39 with 6 floats Results and settings are below Mono

--- 帖子 #284 ---
This is what I have done, the same as I did the previous version. It needs to be in ex4 format and mine is in mq4 format. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Did u compile it? Mono

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Not sure why yours is 13. My is defaulted to 20. I have changed the safearea on mine to 40 though.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I figured it out, stupid error on my part.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I think the main thing is trying to reduce the float from this EA. It eats almost all of the profits.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
My backtesting shows about 2.0 profit factor. Wonder if it has to do with the trade times. I think it would be much better to set the trade times to broker time rather than local as it would eliminate a lot of confusion.... And not to be a party pooper but backtesting phoenix 1.1 on M15 since 2005.11.10 to now yields almost breakeven with about 1.03 profit factor....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Don't think backtesting tells us a great deal about phoenix. Mono - I think the 30-300 set will need testing next week with the time settings to hopefully avoid some bad trades. (Could I ask you a small favour - could you PM me your settings for firebirdG which you've had amazing results with?) tia

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thanks azbofin for the explanation. Is anyone else using the Alpari MT historical data at this link to get better backtest results ? http://www.alpari-idc.com/en/dc/databank.php I have downloaded/installed it and get more reliable backtests (it seems). Using the settings in this text file (attached) on CHF 15M I get 34 trades from 4/1/06 - 7/13/06 with 33W/1L which turns 10k into 13.7k (see results). Running it from 1/1/06 - 7/13/06 yields 56W/3L turning 10K into 13K. A little worse results but still nice. Running it against the EURO and JPY though has yielded basically break-even results. I am using 30/300 because after trying 18/42 and 25/50 they turned out to yield basically break even results over various test periods. Can someone verify me that uses the Alpari data? This sure seems like a good EA so far thx

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Actually GBP turns out well also with 77W/4L from 1/1/06 - 7/13/06 turning 10k into 15.85k but EURO and JPY don't do much of anything. So it looks like GBP and CHF with the settings I have listed above work well.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Tia, All the results I provide come with the settings I use, just look in the zipfiles for the files ending in .set Mono

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Mono, thank you for proving that info but do you really think a SL of 300 is viable?? I can essentially make pretty much any system work at near to no loss in the short term. However it takes just a couple bad trades with that kind of system to wipe you out....

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hey Mono, I noticed that u do not have fast price and slow price listed in your settings.....is that by design??????

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi Zarni Well, I agree with you to a certain degree, it does sound scary. I am waiting for that day and until it comes, hopefully i'll have enough funds to cover my losses. What do you define as short term? I'm currently testing Firebird ( into its 5th week) and with its record of 171/1. I had my doubts, so I started a another test and then another, all with the same/similar results. You cannot ignore the results. Its doing something right. Hopefully Phoenix will do the same or similar job. P.S. If u can make any system work at near to no loss, I would like u to show it. Maybe I'll use yours to go live. Mono

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Yep, they are there at the bottom of the setting. Mono

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Can u post the settings for 171/1 record...I'll give it a try

I need some help. The BUY and SELL signals of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; are generated by the following piece of code:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; MA =iMA(NULL,MA_Timeframe,MA_Length,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_OPEN,0);&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; RVI=iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,0)-iRVI(NULL,0,10,MODE_MAIN,1);&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The MA is the heart of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; and the RVI (Relative Vigor Index) is an additional signal. For a BUY, RVI needs to be &gt; 0 and for a sell &lt;0. I’m not happy with this because it’s far to simple. What I want is an additional signal that takes account of the trend. So no SELL if the trend is up and no BUY if the trend is down. I think this can be a major improvement.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I think a simple fast and slow EMA will do. I have made an indicator (PhoenixAdditionalIndicator) that makes it visible what this signal will do. If it’s red, only SELL’s are valid, green for BUY’s and yellow for BUY’s and SELL’s.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The indicator has the following settings (with the defaults I think will perform best):&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; The indicator is hard-coded for TF=15M!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; SlowMAPeriod = 54;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The slow Moving Average&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; FastMAPeriod = 14;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The fast Moving Average&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PriceConstant = 4;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_CLOSE = 0&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_OPEN = 1&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_HIGH = 2&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_LOW = 3&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_MEDIAN = 4&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_TYPICAL = 5&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PRICE_WEIGTHED = 6&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; EmaMode = 3;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Simple moving average, = 0&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Exponential moving average =1&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Smoothed moving average = 2&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Linear weighted moving average = 3&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Switch = 1.0;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The Switch defines the area where SELL and BUY signals are valid. Above +Switch only BUYS and below –Switch only SELLS.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Please try this indicator and give me some feedback about the default settings.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Mono but your results are a bit deceiving because of the big floating loss. Furthermore one losing trade can would wipe out the equivalent of 10 winning trades.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hey mono, I can literally give you 10s of systems that would book similar results with a SL of 300. That is not saying that Phoenix is not good system. I am not knocking the system. Just knocking the method that you are using All that needs to happen is when you go live for the market to go in strong trend and your account can be wiped out pretty soon with that kind of SL. You could do 300 SL but you need to trade microlots on a 5-10k account otherwise the drawdown and risk can kill you. I do have some systems that are a lot less drawdown however they are very complex and probably impossible to be coded in EA.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
The more volatile pairs with bigger ranges (GBP and CHF) seem to do the best with the 150 or 300 S/L and the wins are consistently more than 10 to 1 on all the timeframes I've tried. Just my observation on backtesting v1.1 so far.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
This looks interesting, Hendrick. Are you proposing this in addition to RVI or in place of? I've placed it on a chart with the old firebird indicator, and it looks like the best trades would be initiated during the yellow areas, which by definition seem to be the ranging areas.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi Ben, In version 2 this new additional signal will replace RVI.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hendrick, Firebird v63g had a trend code in it, but wasn't used. I use it in a modiifed Firebird and it seems to work in stopping trades during trends. extern int DVLimit = 10; // included by Renato int TrendUp=0, Trenddown=0; double iFXAnalyser(int FXA_Period, int mode, int shift)// Made local function by MrPip if ( (iFXAnalyser(0,MODE_DIV,0)&gt;DVLimit*Point &amp;&amp; iFXAnalyser(0,MODE_SLOPE,0)&gt;0 )) Trendup=1; if ( (iFXAnalyser(0,MODE_DIV,0)&lt;-DVLimit*Point &amp;&amp; iFXAnalyser(0,MODE_SLOPE,0)&lt;0 )) TrendDown=1; Then pur "&amp;&amp; TrendUp !=1" following DealTime==1 in SELL trigger. And "&amp;&amp; TrendDown !=1" following DealTime==1 in BUY trigger. Another method is to put a controlling factor for RV! to regulate trading activity. extern double RVI_Factor =50; // 0-200 factor added to RVI value to regulate trading activity Then in SELL and BUY triggers change RVI codes to "RVI&lt;(0-(RVI_Factor*Point))" and "RVI&gt;(0+(RVI_Factor*Point))" respectifully. Another method is to put a second larger iMA envelope to tighten the active trading area to encourage trading during non-trending periods. extern double PercentLimit = 0.15; // 2nd higher envelope (band) that stops trading. int Safe2=0; if ( myMA*(1+(PercentLimit/100))&lt;=Bid || myMA*(1-(PercentLimit/100))&gt;=Ask) Safe2=1; Put "&amp;&amp; Safe2==1" in SELL and BUY triggers. You can attached a 2nd Firebird type Indicator set to PercentLimit to see active trading area. I use one Firebird with all three filters and it averages ~50% less trades with ~90% win rate. The problem I have is the effect news has on the market. I've reported to this thread, that the last 4 Fridays had a big negative effect because of carry over open trades from Thursday. I am testing eliminating trading days and/or times to see if I can better manage the historic group loses. Hendrick, this would be a further development of your trading time results chart and it would be a lot of work. But, I would like to have an EA that is 6/24 trading time programable and can survey its history, determine bad trading times &amp; stop trading during these times, while maintaining a ghost trade history for these times. When historic ghost trades are again profitable, these times are re-established as good trading times. Wishful thinking, but I'm going to try to work on this or see if a coder can make this work. Right now, I use yor type of chart and try to do this manually. Way too much typing. Well, this is what happens when you drink wine while on a thread. If all of this doesn't make sense, it's the wine's fault. Wackena

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I like the idea of the larger envelope. I mentioned that possibility early in the firebird thread, but didn't have the ability to code it. I gotta learn to code MT4. Since finding MT4, I'm no longer using esignal at all -- which is a shame, because I was getting pretty good at coding that. Oh, well. Great work, Wackena.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
That's a great idea. You will probably want to write statistics to a file and read from it. Don't know how to do that in MQL. Hope that is possible.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Wackena, MM is not using Lots from the input parameters. The MM code is calculating the lot size for a normal account and this piece of code is adjusting the lot size for a micro-account: if(MM) { Lots = subLotSize(); if(AccountIsMicro) { Lots=Lots/10; } } I've tested it and it worked as it should. Thanks voor your contribution!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Was that Dutch? PS: I will look into you new MA-Filter. As I am capable of coding MQL4 I decided to go more into development of Phoenix. I hope I will have some ideas for you then. It's worth it - Phoenix is really good!

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi Hendrick, If you backtest with $500 deposit, such as a Micro (Mini) accout minimum deposit, with AccountIsMicro=true, MM=true and Risk=5, there are no orders placed. You need Risk=9 to get a 0.01 lot. double lotMM = MathCeil(AccountFreeMargin() * Risk / 1000) / 100; double lotMM = MathCeil(500 * 5 / 1000) /100 = 0.03 Then with RoundupLots==true lotMM = MathRound(lotMM*10)/10; 0.03 = MathRound(0.03*10)/10 = 0 Wackena

--- 帖子 #311 ---
We have the existing History file as the source file. We need code to scan this file, locate loses, sort loss time frequencies and adjust trading time scheduler accordingly in real time. Then place ghost trades in these time zones, keep in a separate file. Then scan, sort and re-adjust trade scheduler accordingly. Wackena

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Of course, all of that is possible in MQL4. However, these kind of self-adjusting, forward-optimization EAs don't bring as much improvment as you could think. I coded a few...

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Wackena!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I believe you. I'm just too tired at the moment to check. Have been testing &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; all day. I have so many ideas for improving &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; that I don't know where to start. I'm working hard on version 2 and version 3 at the same time. Well, next week first my holydays and after that that back to &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. BTW I really liked one of your previous posts where you told us that you were enjoying a glass of wine while writing your message! I have to make a confession: while I'm writing this I'm doing just the same (I love Cabernet Sauvignon). Is it a habit of the visitors of this thread or just a coincidence? I really appreciate all your contributions to this thread and I will drink my next glass of wine in honour of you. Cheers mate!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; !

I am trying out Mono's wide stoploss method this week and will be using phoenix with 25 tp 250 SL. Lets see how it goes. Mono's results so far is too good to ignore.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I backtested 25/250 on GBP from 1/1/06 to today and its basically break-even (you make $250 on 10k). 30/300 is up about 50% so there's quite a difference. I've found GBP and CHF to be the best candidates from backtests. I'm gonna demo 30/300 on GBP starting this week.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hey Yardie, I agree, seems hard to ignore. But it also seems like we've done these settings before in the early days of firebird and it eventually crashed -- which is what gave rise to Phoenix. I guess the difference now would be no pipstep -- which really! hurt in the strong trends -- and the addition of the new SafePipsMinutes/Distance feature and UseCloseSignal. Hopefuly those along with the SafeArea will make a real difference this time. What concerns me though is his open orders can get quite huge. I'm not sure, but I think I noticed on one of his posted results that his negative open orders were almost as large as all the positive closed trades.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
In backtesting I get bad results with CloseSignal = TRUE but really good results with CloseSignal = FALSE. Anybody experiencing this on a live account?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Guys, sorry but you must be joking right...any system with an SL of 300 cannot be viable...THere will be an inevitable time when it hits 2 or 3 bad trades and that would be it...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
But it all depends on how much wins you have between now and then. If you have over 30 wins then you are already covered for those 3 losses.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Interesting thats a huge difference in results. Thanks for the info I will change to 30 to 300. Whats the lot that you used for your backtest? 1.00 or 0.1?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
BenQ all the results I have seen so far shows closing trade total more than floating trade total.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I don't know if you're interested in my opinion on this. I'm just gonna tell you anyways: ANY system with a SL of 300 is profitable in certain market situations. It works like this: well, we got our entry signal...hmmm...well, even if the signal (long or short) is wrong, it's not gonna hit the S/L because it's SOOOO far away. It's much more likely that it's gonna hit the T/P because it's 10 times nearer. However, the EntrySignal (generated by Phoenix's MA envelope) doesn't matter AT ALL for this kind of strategy. Why? Well, Phoenix's signal is short-term - it's a short-time breakout signal. That means it's doesn't say ANYTHING about the long-term trend - it doesn't even TRY to predict the long-term trend and it's really bad at this, too. So basically you could take ANY entrypoint (I have to confess that Phoenix's Entry points are a little better than random one, however for the long-term trend, they are just a tiny little bit better). With a 300 S/L &amp; 30 T/P you would get nice profits even with a randomly chosen entry point (try some random-signal-EA's for proof), however, only in certain times! These times are the ranging periods. Because if there were huge trends - each more than 400 pips it would be just a 50-50 game if you get onto the right trend to not get stopped out but you don't get 300 pips, so a 50 win 50 loss game DOESN't work out with 30/300. However, in ranging markets, it's going up and down and eventually it's gonna hit your T/P. BUT, you need 10 wins on loss, that takes a while. So probably there's gonna be a period with big trends. And you lose BIG TIME! Well, you don't have to listen to me but please think of it! And maybe you're lucky and it works so long till you have enough money to get out of it but I would NOT try it

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Yardi, I used 1.0 lots. Zarni, Yes, its a huge stop loss but I have downloaded the Alpari data to backtest on MT4 and no matter what time period I choose I get at least break even results (in EUR and JPY) and very good results with GBP and CHF. If you look back at my earlier post on results in this thread you'll see that various periods yield around 50% return on GBP and CHF. I agree it needs forward testing but if you stick to it for at least 6 months I think its viable. You'll notice the winners are far more than 10-1. closer to 20-1. As it stands if you use 18/42 or 25/50 this EA is not going to work if you trust backtesting at all. Its almost always break even. Maybe the next version will work with these TP/SL numbers......but for now I'm gonna demo with 30/300 and just see what happens.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Using Alpari Data I get really good results for 18/42, too. However, don't even think of taking backtesting for accurate! The history you're downloading is without ticks (at least I thin so) so the backtesting is not accurate AT ALL! Not even close. Alright. 1 minutes reamaining. I wonder how Phoenix is doing this week. Last Friday was O.K =&gt; I made 4*18 pips, however nobody knows what's happening with the floats, right? Because I am down 25 pips on floats..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I may be doing something wrong but with the standard settings (and Alpari data with every tick calculated) discussed on here the 18/42 EURO backtest results are not good. See attached. Since 1/1/06 to today I get a PF of 1.03 ($480 profit on 10k)....where did I differ from you on settings ?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yeah, you know, nobody know yet if Phoenix is working on the long run...I haven't tried to backtest it on the whole year, just the last few weeks - The whole year take around 10 minutes here, how long does it take you? The results for the short time were those (as posted before) : http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...&amp;postcount=225 EDIT: Yeah, it really sucks on one year - I just backtested the first few months. I hope it doesn't perform like this in the future . But as said, backtesting stinks so much. So don't rely on it!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
If so my mistake. I just don't like the huge sl. Are you planning on using all Mono's settings? Wasn't he using a 30 min chart with a wider envelope at .1 rather than .05? And if so, wasn't there an early consensus in the firebird thread that certain aspects of it were hard coded for a 15 min chart. I wonder if those 15 min attributes were carried over to Phoneix.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
No it's not hardcoded I think! PHP Code MA = iMA ( NULL , MA_Timeframe , MA_Length , 0 , MODE_SMA , PRICE_OPEN , 0 ); The default for MA_Timeframe is 15 but you can change it! PS: This PHP-tag sucks for MQL, we would need one for MQL4

--- 帖子 #331 ---
It takes 1-2 minutes for me I think to backtest 1/1/06 to today using every tick. My machine is pretty new though, 2.75GHZ.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
What the ****? Is so fast...well, I got a 3200+, too. So it's not that bad either. It's probably because I use an emulator to run Windows Applications on Linux. But it shouldn't be sooo slow. I will look into this.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I don't know. In the early days of firebird there was talk of something being 15 Min. And then maybe I thought of it again when I saw this quote from Hendrick a few posts ago. "The indicator is hard-coded for TF=15M!"&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Well, I don't see anything hardcoded in Phoenix. If you can change it with a variable it's not hard coded

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Well I agree with you there may be periods it works..However the periods it doesn't work (and I believe those will come surely), it will blow up. If you notice recently the market does not know where to go. Once we get the trends from before it will be over. The real way to test this EA is set your TP and SL to the same exact setting and see how it works over longer term. You cannot expect to make a sample test over limited data and conclude that it works based on limiting the probability of SL being hit by setting it to such a number and hoping market will turn back....

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Right, and what happens if those 3 hit you on your real account when you turn the EA on on live trading?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Right, I understand you can change the variables. But if you've read the firebird thread -- and I know it's long -- I remember their was a lot of talk back about a month or so that something about firebird was hardcoded for M15. Maybe it was in the firebird doc from firebird's originator. No big, Hendrick re-wrote it anyway. It might have been in one of the early 63 versions. I don't know if you were trading it back then, but most of us were using M15 for a reason.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I am testing Mono's strategy on the 15 minute time frame to see how it goes. I agree with the earlier poster that say the default setting will lead to break even (or close to it).

Then you have problems. I have also been running this EA on the 30min with at 30/300 but so far the market has not been trending in the longer term so it's hard to know how it will perform. So far since I began testing just over a month ago I have had all winners. The floating loss is scary at times and it does carry a huge risk. The only way to know how it will work in the long run is to keep demo testing it. I am not willing to risk real money until I see how it performs in a trending market. Then again if you reduce your lot size so that the 300 pip risk is only 2 or 3% then 3 straight losses is no big deal. The profits will be smaller though but at least we'll survive longer in a "bad" market. Wiz.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Put it this way. Most people would like to have it the other way around. High reward low risk. The problem is if you were aiming for 300 pip gains how often would you achieve them. Could you get 3 in a row with a risk of 30 pips? The logic says, low risk high reward but most of the time we lose. Having huge stops and small gains seems stupid but maybe, just maybe, that's what will make it work. I've run quite a few tests with firebird. All of the 15 min ones bombed out and I thought the 30min with 30/300 was a stupid idea but it's the only one showing potential at the moment. Please feel free to argue with me. I won't take offence. Maybe the way ahead is to do what most consider to be stupid. My oppinion. Wiz.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Wiz Are u still testing the Firebird 30/300 and if u are can u post your results? I'm currently at 172-1 entering the 5th week Thanks in advance Mono

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes I am still testing but my previous account expired before I was able to save the results. One thing I noticed is that I didn't have as many trades as you have. It may have something to do with the divergence setting. I am using Use_V63D_Divergence=false Wiz.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
No, probably not. If you set Use_V63D_Divergence=false then it's not using the Divergence filter. That means, no trades are filtered out. So you definately don't get more trades if you set it TRUE. Please Correct me if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thanks for that. I don't actually understand the code but that seemed to be the only difference in my settings.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Wiz: alright. Well, not good for Phoenix this freaking volatile market...Closed two order with profit because of the news, but two with loss, too. And the losses are always higher

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Same her with the 15min pheonix. 30min Firebird has quite a large floating loss too. Hopefully it'll settle down in the next few days, but anything is possible. Could completely blow up also.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
We need some more programers to develop Phoenix, there is so much to do!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Have you tried 15 minutes time frame with 30/300?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
9 wins and zero loss so far with my crazy 30/300 setting on the 15 minute chart. Lots of open orders floating though (13 in total).

--- 帖子 #350 ---
You may very well be right...It could be that stupid that nobody even thought to try it. There is maybe some statistical validity to this as markets do tend to range more often than trend....

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi Tradeigel!, Let me give you my opinion about that. I’ve seen several EA’s made useless in the course of time because “programmers” felt the urge to change the code. You have all kind of programmers: from newbie’s to old-timers and everything in between. It’s not hard to understand that with all these people (with their own ideas) working on the same EA, such an EA will finally end as some kind of Christmas-tree and will no longer be suitable to do its job.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I’m a strong opponent of adding new functions to an EA over and over again in the hope that its performance will improve by some piece of “magic” code. There are a lot of Forex strategies out there that are basically very simple and combined with some kind of money management and discipline of the trader became profitable in the end. I think the same should apply to EA’s. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; So I really want to protect &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; against to many ideas and I certainly want it to keep as simple and clean as possible.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; You can call &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt; freeware if you want and of course anyone who wants to change the code is free to do so, but don’t post it in this thread and don’t call it &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; version “whatever”. Just open your one thread, give it another name and maybe this EA will perform a lot better than &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Started a Mono type test three days ago. I'm running 23-2. I closed out the 2 losses manually (-125, -149). I've booked 409 pips and have a current negative float of 10 trades and -173 pips.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Why did you close 2 manually? Kind of defeats the purpose of the EA if you're closing them before the sl. You'll never get a true understanding of what your settings are capable of if you're subjectively closing trades.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Yardie, Do you have UseCloseSignal set to true? You're trading seven pairs right? With 13 open are there any hedged trades or trend trades? Or are you doing this on an older version and these are pipstep entries?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
BenQ I understand what you are saying here. But the primary purpose of an EA is to make money. I dont see anything wrong with some manual trading being done to to maximize pippage using the EA.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
There are hedge soem hedge trades open. The useclosesignal is set to false. I am trading the same 7 pairs. No pipsteps because pHoenix does not have pipstep. Also I think the pipster would cause too many trades to open up..unless the pipstep was wide like say 50 pips or more.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Why did you decide to not use closeSignal? And by older version, I meant a firebird version. With so many open I thought it had to be pipstep entries or surf entries. It just didn't occur to me that you would not use closeSignal.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Yes, but how do you know you're maximizing and are you prepared to sit and watch it 24/7 and manually close trades here and there. I really prefer an EA that can profit on its own. Of course they all need to be monitored, but I'd rather it trade on its own. Besides, how could anyone then say an EA is profitable if they've manually closed "x" percentage of trades.

Phoenix version 2. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Changes:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; removed divergence (I think its of no use)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; removed Surf-orders (performance was not good)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; replaced RVI by this piece of code:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; AdMA=(iMA(NULL,PERIOD_M15,120,0,0,3,1) - iMA(NULL,PERIOD_M15,12,0,0,3,1));&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; if(Point==0.0001) {AdMA=AdMA*1000;}&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; if(Point==0.01) {AdMA=AdMA*10;}&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; if(AdMA &gt; 1)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; {&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; AdSELLSignal = true;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; SortOrder = "SELLSignal";&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; }&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; if(AdMA &lt; -1) &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; {&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; AdBUYSignal = true;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; SortOrder = "BUYSignal";&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; }&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; if((AdMA &gt; -1) &amp;&amp; (AdMA &lt; 1)) &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; {&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; AdBUYSELLSignal = true;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; SortOrder = "BUYSELLSignal";&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; }&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The purpose of this code is to prevent that &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is placing trades against the trend.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; For testing:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Use the settings from the file. TF=15. All available pairs.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks, Hendrick. Some interesting default changes in SafePipsMinutes/distance, safe area, tp, sl and trailing stop. I'll put this right to work.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hendrick, I totally agree with you about not having a Christmas tree EA or having 10 thousand different version hanging around here. However, I meant we would need more programers out here to have so good ideas - actually "programers" wasn't the right word. I meant just creative people. Because they could suggest stuff like the new MA-thing you added to Phoenix v.2. Because it's so much work just for you to come up with all these ideas, you know? I meant we would also need people who just try using advanced MA with less lag and look how Phoenix is doing with these kinds of MA. You could never do all this. I hope I clarified my opinion PS: And thx for Phoenix v2 EDIT: I just saw the new S/L &amp; T/P. If Phoenix works with that, it's awesome. Because as somebody else said, an EA with 18/42 is very likely to suceed on the short run. However, an EA which works with 60/55 is really good.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Couple questions, Hendrick. Is this version using the PhoenixAdditionalSignal indicator you posted previosuly? If so, then I can add that to the chart and it should match up with signals? Also, the default for SafeArea is huge now. Is it calculating the same way the old Phoenix_IND_v1 was, so that can be added to the chart as well? Thanks for your tireless work on this EA and continuing support to make it the best.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Its about risk control for me. Without closing the 2 trades, I had 690 pips booked with an exposure of -3600 pips = -2910 pips With the two trades closed, I have 416 (typo earlier) pips booked with an exposure of 3000 pips = -2584 pips Why close two? Pretty simple. At -125 pips the one trade needed to move 155 pips to close out positive and -175 to stop out. The 125 pip move would strongly suggest the trend is against me and there is no positive expentancy of a winning trade. At the time, my third largest losing trade was only down -43 pips. That's 73/227. No reason to close it. The potentially fatal flaw of a 30/300 setup is the losing trades swallowing up 10 winners. I had closed 20+ winners and had 2 trades that needed to move as far against the trend as they had already fallen. If one takes those 22 trades as two series of 11 trades (keeping with a 30/300's 10/1 ratio), the first netted 151 pips and the second 175. That 326 pips essentially pays for a additional loser. I could be wrong, but I believe some active risk and money management here, will get a Mono type approach to a point of safety more quickly. Maybe our goals are just different. I really don't have a desire to have a completely automated method of trading. But I would hardly call the desicion to close out my trades "subjective."

HI Hendrick.. i'd followed ur thread since with firebird.. n what have u done is great man... now im using firebirdH02 in real account n still in profit.. but i think i have a problem with phoenix v 1.1 n i thought its because the 'time' setting..your place is +2 so i just add 6 hours to ur setting but confused that it will be in different day and we cant set the time more than "24" rite? TradeFrom1=1 TradeUntil1=3 TradeFrom2=14 TradeUntil2=18 TradeFrom3=19 TradeUntil3=21 TradeFrom4=22 TradeUntil4=24 &lt;&lt;-- (12.00 midnight)is this correct? My place is GMT +8 if we look back at your setting..i have change the "TradeFrom1" place with "TradeFrom4" because it will be different day if i follow ur setting.. and "TradeFrom4=24" set to '24' or '0' cuz i confused..sorry if this is a noob question.. i ve read ur msg but still confused with this setting.. cuz it just show a trade for one day only when i try to backtest using strategy tester.. n one more thing.. ur Phoenix-v2 will be great i think cuz i try to backtest n the performance is cool ..it can open variable lots n i think it will be the best EA for me someday.. Thank you very much for your effort in making this great EA... we will support you from behind ...dun give up...You CAN DO IT.. GOOD LUCK n THANX

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Obviously subjective was not correct in your case. However, using such a large stop loss opens the door to trades being closed outside of the EA's parameters. Good luck with that.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks for this great explanation. I think your goals are perfectly logical and well explained. Would you mind sharing what pairs you are using for your testing? Thanks.

Hey buddy!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I understand you now and above all I appreciate all your contributions to this thread (are you Dutch?.. if so PM me because I'm desperate to talk to someone about &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; in my own language).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I've studied the trades version 2 made this day and I'm impressed (I hope I don't sound to pigheaded, recommending my own EA this way... it's really not my intention). I think the EMA instead of the RVI makes a lot of difference. I'm now struggling with the SL. The SL and TP of 55/60 is OK. Try it!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hey Ben, Because I want to know how version behaves under all circumstances I've increased SafeArea and SafePipsDistance a lot more than usual. It’s only for testing because version 2 will behave a lot more different than version 1.1. I will return to the subject of the indicator later. Cheers!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I've been running it with your default settings since it was posted. Looks interesting so far and in profit. Trail stop seems to be working fine. One trade was closed at BE and one closed when it hit the TS on a retracement. Currently has 4 open trades, all in profit at the moment. I'd like to see MM start adjusting my lots. On a 10k account, all trades opened so far have been for .50 lots. It's set to round up. I'll be more comfortable with it when I see it changing lot sizes up or down beyond the initial size. Thx for all you do.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi Eqnaz, Please post your settings. I guess you are using MM=true with an account of 100.000? The setting for midnight is 24.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
I will change it Ben, but I've only left 2 days before I have my Holydays (and have to leave my PC...).

--- 帖子 #375 ---
hi hendrick.. thanx for reply.. this is my setting.. im using MM true MA_Length = 10; MA_Timeframe = 15; Lots = 1; MM = true; RoundupLots = true; AccountIsMicro = false; SafePipsMinutes = 240; SafePipsDistance = 180; Percent = 0.05; SafeArea = 150; Risk = 5; TakeProfit = 40; StopLoss = 55; TrailingStop = 21; UseCloseSignal = false; TradeFrom1 = 0; TradeUntil1 = 24; TradeFrom2 = 0; TradeUntil2 = 0; TradeFrom3 = 0; TradeUntil3 = 0; TradeFrom4 = 0; TradeUntil4 = 0; WantToGamble = false; GambleFrom = 16; GambleUntil = 17; GambleFactor = 2;

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Statement of one day with version 2. Of course much too early to have an opinion about this, but I think the performance of this version is much better than the previous version. When placing trades &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; now takes the trend in consideration. I will post version 2.1 today or tomorrow where you can adjust a lot of settings of the new EMA-code. Stay tuned!

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Oh, no problem -- for whatever reason I assumed MM was already fully working. Have a great vacation -- you deserve it!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
hendrick, I love Phoenix v2! I looks very, very promising.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Wow, how many pairs are you trading -- must be 13 or 14. Looks good so far.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Close signal has the potential to close positions with huge losses. Say for example I have a position with a -80 pips floating and the ea decide to open another position in the other direction. I would lose on the closed trade..and there are no guarantees that the trade in the other direction would work out.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
BenQ you wouldnt have to be sitting down monitoring to close it. You can do it at the end of the week / day etc.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Because this version is so different compared to the previous one, I'm going to test all pairs again. Up till now I have the idea that this version is suitable for all kinds of markets. Maybe, just maybe, we can drop all the safety measures (SafePipsDistance, SafeArea) and let this baby run for 24 hours and without any restrictions. More tomorrow!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Wow take profit equals 60 and stop loss equals 55? sounds too good to be true. Hendrick can you show us what results you have gotten from this setting thus far?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
In Backtesting, it's doing pretty awesome.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Care to elaborate with numbers? Are you using the default settings?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hendrick: in BT timeSettings (when it's trading) are still very important. No, I don't care, maybe I am gonna post some BT results soon. But the best is you test it on your own.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Why would we need to adjust the settings Hendrick.. Arent those the bread and butter of the EA and shouldnt they be constant across the board?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Fair enough I am forward testing. I dont trust backtesting that much.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hendrick is there any particular reason why you are not using USECLOSESIGNAL with Phoenix 2?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Yardie, Version 2 of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is operating completely different than version 1. So I have to rediscover the optimum settings again! That’s why I started version 2 as basic as possible (no UseCloseSignal, no SafeArea, no SafePipsDistance and so on)&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #391 ---
With "no" SafeArea, no SafePipsDistance you mean almost no, right? I mean it's still there but the filter filters out very few trades. BTW, did you try different gamble times? in BT, I would never use yours, maybe one hour later or 8-9 o'clock.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
The indicator for Firebird posted on #299, is that an EA or is that the indicator version? Would like to try the Firebird indicator if one is avaliable. Tks for all replys.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi, It is an indicator, and it is Phoenix, not Firebird.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
That's the indicator for the PhoenixAdditionalSignal. It plots the permission subgraph. Is that what you want, or are you looking for the firebird indicator that plots the MA envelope? If your're looking for the Firebird indicator, that hasn't been posted in this thread and probably will not per Hendrick's request to keep the thread clean. The indicator itself was posted more than once in the firebird thread.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Thanks for those replys. Will give the Firebird Indicator a try.

Hendrick I am a little confused - kyk asseblief na die volgende: In your statement posted yesterday there are trades that do not make sense... You sold the eurusd (line 2) at 1.2636.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #397 ---
No, that's alright. Hendrick is using Trailingsstop - this moves the S/L as you go deeper in profit. So his T/P was @ 60 Pips profit right from the beginning and his S/L was moved to lock in the profit. Well, but I guess you know what a TrailingStop is, right?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Wow I got up this morning to get greeted by some huge losses thanks the the big upswing in the GBPUSD and GBPJPY pairs. This EA will hurt you on big swings.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hendrick, I'm running v2 with the PhoenixAdditionalSignal in the subgraph. At 10:45 (GMT+2) a short in gbpusd fired while the subgraph was green. You haven't spoken of the indicators used yet in v2, but I thought that was one of them. If so, the short should not have occured while the AdditionalSignal was green if I understood your explanation correctly. Maybe a bug?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
hey Hendrick, like Yardie and BenQ GPB/USD sucked for me, today. I guess the safety doesn't work in Phoenix yet, shouldn't the new MA-thing prevent Phoenix from trading against such a BIG trend? However, except for GBP/USD Phoenix did a great job till now. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I am back to version 1.1 of Phoenix and Mono's crazy SL method. I will be sticking with this for a while to see how it goes.

You have to remember that v2 is still operating wide open. In other words, the safe features are set quite high just for these initial testing purposes. If SafeArea, for example, had been set to its usual setting of 40/-40 or a bit tighter, the losing gbp would not have occured. So it needs more time to hash out the optimum settings.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
that's right. I like Phoenix v2 the best though! Right now, +60 pips in floats (4 trades open). And the best is if it goes against me, I am still taking good profit. However, if it continues to go where it should I don't take only a little bit because of T/P. EDIT: Made 43 Pips with EUR/USD, that would never have been possible with the versions before because of the T/P.

After 2 days with &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; version 2 my account balans is now 5084 (started with 5000). Not very spectacular. But this was with all pairs, no SafePipDistance, no SafeArea and no Time-filters. If I had used my regular time-filters my balans would be 5372. That’s better. I'm not sure about that, but if I had used SafePipDistance and SafeArea I think the results were even better. So what I will do the next three weeks is running a demo with all pairs, but with all the settings I used before. A file with t hese settings is attached. Also Phoenix 2.1 is attached. With this version you can play with the EMA-settings. Look at the code and you know what I mean.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Alright. Thank you Hendrick. Why do you post this settings file, too? These settings are the defaults of the EA, right?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thanks Tradeigel - it's clear to me now! Yes, I am trading live on InterbankFx and I do use trailing stops when I jump into bed at night...

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Great job, Hendrick, thank you. What are you doing with MM on this version? I thought it was working in v1 and changing lot sizes. But in v2 you added the round up feature. All my v2 trades are at .50 lots. It doesn't appear to be changing lot sizes. Anyway, I know you're getting ready to leave on holiday -- have a great time! Relax, enjoy.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi Hendrick, Thank you for the attachment of Phoenix. But I dont know what program is comparible with it. I tried to open it early, but the window didnt realize the software. It would be so thankful if you can show me the software/program to run the Phoenix. Thank you, Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'm using esigal. Now, how do I install Firebird and Phoenix into my platform? million thanks! Nguyen

--- 帖子 #410 ---
As far as I know, that's not gonna work. All of us here are using MetaTrader ( http://www.metaquotes.net I think). So if you don't wanna convert Phoenix to Esignal, I guess, you have to use MT. @BenQ: Well, the RoundLot function is for rounding to miniLots i.e. 0.25 is rounded. In addition to that, MM is setting the lots your trading according to your free margin and Risk.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Tradeigel, I know it's for rounding, but at some point it should raise my lot size above .50 lots for the excess free margin in my account. What I'm sayng is that I haven't see it do that yet. MM is set to true and RoundUpLots is set to true. I guess I will have to wait for a few more wins and see if it goes from .50 lots right to .60 lots. I'm wondering it there's any in-between with RoundUpLots. Thx.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
tradeigel, Hendricks new trial setting v21 have lower safepipsdistance and safearea. one suggestion may be to avoid big news times for the particular pairs(s) affected, eg. not trading today around time of UK data.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
For the record I will be using Phoenix 2.1 with the following settings over the next few weeks: SL - 300 TP - 50 Trailing Stop - 30 What do you all think? Its a play on Mono's crazy SL method.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Well, I like the idea of including the trailing stop. Are you going to be using safearea, safepipsminutes/distancel? Trading 24hrs? I'm sure you'll get a lot of wins. With such a large sl, what did you decide about using closesignal? I'll definitely be watching for your results.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Yes I am using the default safearea, safepipminutes/distance in Phoenix2.1. I am not using closesignal.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Yardie Nice to see you thinking outside of the norm. Dont be afraid to try abnornal parameters, they might surprise you. Mono

--- 帖子 #417 ---
So far 3 wins and 4 partial wins (closed by Trailing Stop) for a total of 194 booked pips. Floating loss is 40 pips at the moment.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Just one day with Phoenix 2.1 (Time-filters, SL=42, TP=18, TS=0).

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Looking good so far.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
well...what a day...booked a few wins this morning. Also, Phoenix did good during the CPI announcement. However, later right after Bernanke's speech, there was one awesome win (60 Pips) and two losses (2x 50 Pips). This time a really tight S/L would have been awesome...However, this normally doesn't work so well. Does anybody use this strategy? Hendrick, your statement(is your timefilter like always?) looks awesome, how did you do after 16:00 ?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
This is what happened. You know I use time-filters. One, is not trading from 15:00 to 16:00 pm. So at 16:00 it opened new trades and then we had the the Bernanke's speech at 16:00. Result: five losing trades at a row! I've noticed that all these news events are at "round times": 8:00, 10:30, 16:00 and so on. So the solution is simple: for the time-filters I have to take minutes in consideration: 16:13 instead of 16:00 for example. Will do this in version 2.3. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Well I have no losses yet because I have a huge stop loss (300 pips). My loating is quite large though (about 360 pips in total). My booked pips is 248 so far.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi everyone, I started Phoenix 2.1 after Bernanke gave his speech this morning. I guess it's working because it hasn't entered a trade yet. Question.. when do the SafePipDistanceNOW values update? Also, I'm assuming that if the NOW values are above Your SafePipDistance and Your SafeArea values, then it won't place trades? Does that make sense? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yes, I agree with the quote. I've been watching it closely and that seems to be how it's working.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
It looks like there is a small problem with the function subLotSize. I imagine it would not come into play that often but if your account free margin was low then the lot size could come out to bigger than expected. Take these figures: account free margin = $990 Lots = 1 Risk = 5 rounduplots = false account is micro = false the calculated lot size would be 1.0 Now if your account free margin is $991 the calculated lot size would be 0.1 I checked the higher values and they all come out ok and increase as your account free margin increases. It is just the small ones. I would remove the Lots extern variable as it is effectivly not used anyway and replace the line: Inserted Code if(lotMM &lt; 0.1) lotMM = Lots; with Inserted Code if(lotMM &lt; 0.1) lotMM = 0.1;

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Geat couple days for Phoenix. In the last two days my v1.1 is 25/2. My v2.1 has closed 17/3 with 5 open trades. Each of the open trades is positive with a float of approx + 500 pips. Looking good.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
WOW! That looks really nice. Let's check settings... You aren't using these crazy 300/30 settings, are you? And how can you have made +500 on EACH open trade?! PS: Does anybody have experience with the Vegas methods and/or closing trading according to fib numbers? I don't, so it would be nice of this guy to tell us if there's a possibility to improve Phoenix with it.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
No, I didn't mean each open trade is 500. Each open trade is positive -- the total float is/was 500. Using default settings on v2.1

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I wonder how comes you have so many open trades? I am using Phoenix2.1 as well and had only one trade opened today (and also closed). Settings are default except for the take profit and all that.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Is anyone still testing Hendrick's earlier 55/60 settings or has everyone abandoned it in preference to the 18/42 settings? Just want to know the difference in results. I'm still live with Firebird and at 11-4 for the week on 3 majors. Pheonix in demo is 15-3 on the same 3 majors.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
That is odd. As I write this message, I have 4 open trades in v2.1. Three are in profit and one is about BE. Two of them are within 10 pips of hitting their trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I have a version running the 60/55. It produced the results I mentiond in #426.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Did it produce the 25-2 or 17-3 results? In either case, that's great!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
BenQ, how did you do after Bernanke's speech? Do you use CloseSignal = TRUE? And you say +500, what is your trading volume?

--- 帖子 #435 ---
The 60/55 produced the 17/3. CloseSignal is set to false on that version.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
The v1.1 versions did best for me during/after Bernanke.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I started 2 demos on Phoenix v2.1 on July 19 ~16:30 GMT on eur/usd, gbp/usd, usd/jpy, usd/chf, aud/usd, eur/gbp, eur/jpy. $5.000 Demos and MM=true, WantToGamble=true. 1st demo - tp=60, sl=55, ts=18. Same timefilters as Hendirck set to EST. 6 wins - no loses - 1 breakeven. Profit = $279.74. (it should be noted that for the 1st 14 hours, I was only running eur/usd, gbp/usd, usd/jpy, usd/chf) 2nd demo - tp=18, sl=42, ts=0. Same timefilters. 8 wins - no loses. Profit = $305.05 What I find interesting about using the ts is that when it can, it adjusts the sl to a point above the Buy entry point or below the Sell entry point. When successful in doing this by the OrderModify function, it makes sure of profits on that order. On Demo 1 above, the 6 wins consist of 5 sl profits and 1 tp profit. COOL. Wackena

Hi all, I'm trying to run Pheonix on a new demo acct, but I get a frown face on my chart and an error when it attempts to open orders. Attached are my settings.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
What is the error message you're getting?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Pheonix_EA_v1_1 USDCHF, M15: Error Opening Sell Order: 4109

--- 帖子 #441 ---
error 4109 is "trade not allowed". Is this the only pair you're getting the message on? Have other orders opened fine? And I notice your time filters are set. Change them to trade 24 hours and start there.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Alpha, what broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
It's a North Finance demo.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
How do I do that? Set them all to 0 or 24?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
No, not all of them. Just set TradeFrom1 to 0 and TradeUntil1 to 24. All the rest get 0.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
THAT DID IT! THANKS!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
SO you mean 17 x 60 pips and 3 x 55 pip loss? Or some of those 17 wins are actually trailing stop wins?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I am not sure how people are gettinc so many different results with version 2.1. I have been running from before Bernanke speech yesterday and I am looking at 11 wins (6 full at 50 pips and 5 partial) and hypotethically 6 losses. I said hypothetically because I am using a wide stop. But I I was using a 55 or 42 stop I would have been stopped out on them.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I'm similar Yardie, I've been running since after Bernanke's speech yesterday too, and still have it running. I'm trading it on the gbp/usd, eur/usd, usd/cad, and usd/chf. I'm 8-0 with one open trade, which is currently about -5 pips. I'm using the SL-55, TP-60, TS-18. All 8 winners have hit trailing stops for gains. At 2 mini lots per trade, profits have run from $2.80 to $58.00. I'm not looking for tremendous wins; i'm looking for consistent wins. Number of lots can always be increased later. (Still demo, by the way)

--- 帖子 #450 ---
The problem with the small trailing stop gains is that your gain can be quickly wiped out with one or two losses.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
What are your TP/SL/TS settings?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Most of the wins are trailing stop wins. In fact, only two of the wins went to full profit. The TS is working good and moving up nicely to lock in profit. My TS is set to 18, but I belive there's a few cases where it moved up more than once. In other words, some wins are 18, some are 36, etc. And without using UseCloseSignal, all 3 losses went to full stop of 55. Trading .50 lots, it's ahead by just under $900.

I am trading 24 hours on 7 pairs. I did have some brief connection issues this morning though. Not sure if this would have anything to do with it. Does the EA use some kind of built-in timer?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
What do you mean, "build-in timer"?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I can see an improvement that can be made with the safe pip distance calculation. At the moment there are some hard code constants for point values. These are not covering all the different values that could be possible (they would depend on what pairs you were using), so the result may not always be correct. To correct the problem this code: Inserted Code if(Point==0.01) valTOT=MathAbs(valTOT)*100; if(Point==0.0001) valTOT=MathAbs(valTOT)*10000; could be changed to: Inserted Code valTOT=MathAbs(valTOT)*MathPow(10, Digits);

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Actually, i think you could just do this:

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Well the EA Phoenix 2.1 has not opened a trade in the past 24 hours. I am not sure what is wrong. Everything looks fine (expert enabled etc etc). ANy ideas what could be wrong and how I can fix it? I am sure that I have already missed out on a lot of pips already, and it was working fine before.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
That's really odd, Yardie. Can you post your settings? Maybe someone will notice something in them.

In your Journal, has there been attempts to place orders? Any error messages? Wackena

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Because I deleted and restarted everything, my journal got deleted as well. I will be checking today.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I don't see any obvious error with the settings. As the day plays out you'll have to watch for journal entries.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Alright, thebts, I think you're totally right. Thank you very much; we really appreciate this. I will send Hendrick a PM to tell him about that since he's on vacation right now, he's probably gonna miss this suggestion. Keep up the good work!

I am using a demo at StrategybuilderFX. Not sure if this makes a difference or not.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I have not had a new trade opened on any of the major pairs in about 24 hours. My only new trade in the last 12 hours has been EUR/AUD. I am trading 12 pairs. A day ago I had 12 active trades. I currently have 7 active trades. I am using default settings except for SL and TP and I trade 24 hrs a day. The only errors in the journal are related to trailing stops. I am using MetaQuotes Demo. Does Phoenix 2.1 only open 1 trade per pair before waiting for a while? EDIT NOTE: As of 13:45 GMT three new trades have opened in the last 5 minutes. What about you Yardie?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I use them as well and haven't had any problems. Did you mentioned whether you were getting the smileys on the chart?

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Yes smiley face is there and all thatr. One order was opened a few hours ago BUY GBPUSD but thats it. There are no error messages in the journal. Only one position -- GBPUSD was open yesterday as well. So 2 GBPUSD position opened in almost 48 hours. No other trades in any other pairs were opened. Something is definitely wrong. .. But hard to say what it is.

Hi, Have you followed these steps to install the EA? Ok. I will list the steps and you can see if yours are correct. 1. close MT4 2. right click on start button left corner. left click on explore. 3. Scroll down until you find program files and click on the + sign. 4. scroll down until you find your broker MT4 folder and click on the + sign 5. here in the experts folder is where you place your EA. (not in the indicator folder) 6. Start your MT4 program back up. 7. Make sure you Navigator window is open on the left side, below the currency prices. 8. scroll thru the navagtor until you find your EA. 9. Drag that EA into your chart window. 10. Right click in your chart window and select Expert Advisors and then select properties. 10. this will bring up the menu of settings. 11. You can adjust the settings to any that you have found in this thread or use your own. 12. select the common tab and make sure the Allow Live Trading is selected 13. press ok. 14. go to the top of the program and make sure that the menu tab for Expert Advisors shows a green arrow and not a red x. if the red x is present, just press the tab and it will go green. 15. You should now have a smiley face in the right hand corner of your screen. Please ignore the steps you already know. I have no idea what your level is... hope this helps... Thanks Scott

When there is a buysell signal generated only the buy is actually executed. Does anyone know if this was intended? Was the real intention to hedge this position and see which direction unfolded?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I double checked this and it looks like i was a bit mixed up. The Percent bands confirm which direction is to be traded after the buysell signal is generated, so only one would ever be traded anyway.

Can someone tell me how many trades were opened and closed on July 20th and 21st using Phoenix 2.1? I have a total of two trades (one on each day) for both of those days and both were on GBPUSD only. I am not sure what is wrong with the EA all of a sudden.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I have a lot(more than 20), on EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD GPB/USD AND EUR/USD, with 4 huge loses, and those small gains. $5000 demo account, down to $4762.93 in two days.

Yardie, I had 25 trades, 4 losses in the last 2 trading days, with 12 pairs. Friday was a losing day.

I wonder why orders are not opening up for me? Any Metatrader experts here that can give me some suggestions? I am at a lost.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Money Management does not appear to be working properly on v1.1 Details: 10k account. Lots is set to 1, MM is true, RoundUpLots is true, AccountIsMicro is false, Risk is 5. When the account first started, it properly set the lots at .50. When the free margin reached $11,000 it did not adjust, presumably because the next lot level is .60 rounded up. In other words, it wouldn't adjust until the free margin was actually $12,000 because of the RoundLotsUp feature. Hendrick added this feature because a lot of brokers will not accept order sizes such as .55, .56, etc. So I just assumed it would adjust when the free margin hit $12,000. Well, the free margin is actually now $12,468 and it is still placing .50 lot size orders. Anyone else notice this or have a fix? Thx.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Phoenix2.1 is only placing orders on the GBPUSD pair for me hehe.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Not sure why that is, Yardie. In the last hour my v2.1 has opened 5 positions -- usdchf, eurusd, eurjpy, gbpusd. and usdjpy. Did you create a template when you placed the EA and all the settings on all the charts, or did you do each manually? Try creating a template from the gbpusd pair, and then placing that template on all the other pairs so that everything is exactly the same. Then check for smileys on each. Also, for each chart, click on tools, options, expert advisors, and make sure "allow live trading" is checked. Even though you have smileys, I've caught that setting a couple times being off when it should have been on.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
They are all set for live trading. I just created a templated from the GBPUSD and load it to the others. I was using a template to begin with..but I say why not? Its worth a try. lets see if any more orders are executed now.

Thanks for sharing your information Is this your only forward testing? This is your setting: MA_Length=10 MA_Timeframe=15 Lots=1.00000000 MM=0 RoundupLots=1 AccountIsMicro=0 UseSafePips=1 SafePipsMinutes=240 SafePipsDistance=60 Percent=0.05000000 UseSafeArea=1 SafeArea=40.00000000 Risk=5 TakeProfit=60 StopLoss=55 TrailingStop=18 UseCloseSignal=1 TradeFrom1=0 TradeUntil1=24 TradeFrom2=0 TradeUntil2=0 TradeFrom3=0 TradeUntil3=0 TradeFrom4=0 TradeUntil4=0 WantToGamble=0 GambleFrom=10 GambleUntil=11 GambleFactor=2 P_EMA_Long=120 P_EMA_Short=12 P_EMA_TimeFrame=15 P_EMA_Method=3 P_EMA_Price=5 As I see in your statement and settings. Your money management is disabled, you are trading 24 hours straight and trading 1 lot for a 5k account. These are possible factors that affects negatively your testing. My recommendations: 1. Turn on your Moneymanagement feature and trade at most 5% of your account for each trade. 2. Dont trade 24 hours. Its statiscally proven that at certain hours you have more risk of losing trades. More trades doesnt means more profit. Try the default settings of Phoenix 2.1 3. You are trading 1 lot, 20% percent of your account, you can gain more but you can also lose more. Here is the default settings of Phoenix 2.1 Phoenix 2.1 MA_Length=10 MA_Timeframe=15 Lots=1.00000000 MM=1 RoundupLots=0 AccountIsMicro=0 UseSafePips=1 SafePipsMinutes=240 SafePipsDistance=60 Percent=0.05000000 UseSafeArea=1 SafeArea=40.00000000 Risk=5 TakeProfit=60 StopLoss=55 TrailingStop=18 UseCloseSignal=0 TradeFrom1=8 TradeUntil1=12 TradeFrom2=13 TradeUntil2=15 TradeFrom3=16 TradeUntil3=18 TradeFrom4=19 TradeUntil4=21 WantToGamble=1 GambleFrom=16 GambleUntil=17 GambleFactor=2 P_EMA_Long=120 P_EMA_Short=12 P_EMA_TimeFrame=15 P_EMA_Method=3 P_EMA_Price=5 You can try different settings with different combinations of TP, SL, Wanttogamble, TS, etc. But dont turn off the MM and stick to the default trading time. Hope this can help the community trying different settings for the best results.

Hi, When the price is crossing the envelopes a BUY or SELL signal is generated because Phoenix expects the price will return between these envelopes (counter-trend). Above that there is an extra mechanisme that takes the trend in consideration. So if the previous trend was up only the BUY signals are accepted ans so on. When the market is ranging SELL and BUY signals are valid. When you activate the option "Comments" for your trades you can see which signal was used for your trade (BUYSignal, SELLSignal, BUYSELLSignal).

I'm using hendrick's default settings on MIG. I cannot upload my statement though, keeps saying invalid file type for an HTM file! How do I do this?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
to GP2X and others I checked GP2X's statement and as expected 5 of the 6 losses where opened outside of Hendrick's default trading filter. Loses outside time filter Open time Income 1. 3:23 -30.00 2. 3:47 -472.83 3. 4:34 -550.00 4. 7:38 -290.00 5. 15:39 -471.78 Total loses outside time filter : 1814.61 Loses inside of the time filter Open time Income 1. 17:24 -120.00 Total lost inside time filter : 120.00 As with your setting of 1 lot per trade, that limits your capability of simultaneous open trades to 5 or less. Thus limiting the EA to open possible winning trades.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
the common way to do it is to compress it using any zip or tar compressing program. Look into WinZip if you're using Windows otherwise (gnu)zip.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
thanks tradeigel

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Thanks CGLDSMTH Your 4 loses on friday are based on 3 less traded pairs, CHFJPY, GBPCHF and EURCAD. CHFJPY Open time Income 1. friday 21 -362.25 2. friday 21 155.40 3. friday 21 -360.88 Total -567.63 GBPCHF Open time Income 1. friday 21 -338.95 EURCAD Open time Income 1. friday 21 -372.77 Usually friday and holidays arent good days for trading these types of pair. CGLDSMTH Can you please continue your forward testing for at least 1 week, so we can see the behaviors of these types of pairs. Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #497 ---
amazingly, these 3 pairs accounted for all the losers while testing phoenixv2.0 also. I'll continue forward testing them, but a good move if going live would be to ditch them and not trade on fridays, I agree.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
If you ever go live with this EA, I recommend you trading EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD, AUDUSD, EURGBP, EURJPY. But at the same time try forward testing CHFJPY, NZUSD, GBPCHF and EURAUD for at least 1-2 months. 1-2 weeks forward testing isnt enough to obtain sufficient data about these pairs.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Hey, welcome back Hendrick!

--- 帖子 #500 ---
LOL my Phoenix2.1 is still giving me problems LOL. I am about to give up...maybe switch to an older version. Hendrick any ideas why the EA would stop working properly? Is there anyway I can debug it or something?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Thanks! I turned off MM because it gave me 131 error. I will try changing the lots to 0.5 or 0.1. It's set to 24 hours because I want to find the good trading time. It proved that the default trading time slots are good.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
It would be nice after a while to have a sort-of finalized settings list of parameters that have been found to consistenly give positive results. I know it's tough for me to keep track of who's running which test, which version EA, which pairs, 24 hr vs default trade times, SL, TP, and TS. From what I gather now, it is better to leave the default trading times in place (modified for your own time zone) rather than having it run 24/7? Does that seem to be the general concensus? Thanks. I really appreciate this forum, Hendrick's hard work on this excellent EA, and everybody's willingness to share their successes, as well as share their losers too.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Yeah, it's better to use the time settings. However, the pretty much best settings are always the most recent one which were issued together with the EA by Hendrick. I would test it anyways and get your own understanding of the best settings according to your trading style.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I have not been able to use the EA properly since July 19th. I am not sure what is wrong...even version2 is not working. I have sorted of given up now but Tradeigel is trying to help me out. Baffling.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Yardie, maybe the version you have somehow got corrupted. Maybe try deleting it and downloading a fresh version -- just thinking out loud here.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Check you bar history for gaps on all timeframes. MT4 might have lost the plot. (corrupt .hst files) Mono

--- 帖子 #507 ---
How do I do this? Please tell me what I need to do step by step thanks. Benq already tried deleting and installing fresh copy no dice. Still one GBPUSD trade per day hehe.. and today it opened up one USDCAD pair.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
So you installed a fresh copy of your MT4 platform. Cool. This is all stuff you probably did already, but what I like to do is to copy Hendrick's setting file into the \experts\preset subdirectory. Then I open up a new chart, attach the Phoenix EA, click on Load, select the settings file, then click OK. I do this for each pair's chart I want to trade. Make sure Live Trade is checked for each chart and Expert Advisor is enabled for the system. You should see your smiley face in the upper corner of each chart. By loading the setting file for each pair, I'm assured of getting the same value for each parameter. Hope this helps!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Yes, 4x, but unless you're in GMT +2 remember to change your times if you're using his exact settings. Also, making a template might save you a bit of time as well.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Yes Ben, I forgot to mention that, thanks!. I never tried making a template. That would be for loading EA's as well as whatever indicators you want to attach, right? Anything else that can be done with a template?

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Ok, got a newbie question.. When I look at a chart with Phoenix 2.1 running on it, I see in the upper left a value called AdMA? What moving average is it, and what is the value telling me? Right now, looking at the gbp/usd, the AdMA value is 1.6505 (on the M15 chart, btw).

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Yes, templates are the best. Just set up one chart exactly like you want it -- EA, settings, indicators, candlesticks whatever. Once it's like you want it, click the templates button, save template, and then name it. Then open another chart, click the template button and scroll down to whatever you saved it as. Viola -- you have a new chart just like the first. Just continue to open as many charts as you want and load the template. You can save multiple templates with variations in the settings as long as you name it something else. Makes it easy.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Sweeeet.. I had no idea you could save so much info on a chart with a template. Thanks for the info!!

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Alright guys I removed StrategybuilderFX completely from my computer and reinstalled a fresh copy as well as a fresh copy of Phoenix2.1 -- everything is activated. Wish me luck.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Alright Yardie, that's probably gonna do it. If you want you can post your settings, too so we can look if everything's alright. And please don't become desperate. BTW guys, Phoenix is doing awesome right now...Started a new demo with only Phoenix v2.1 07/20/06. Always traded 0.2 lots on 4 pairs @ M15 =&gt; 433 $ profit. wins-losses: 20-1 with TrailingStop set to 18 and S/L to 55. Sounds pretty nice, right? These days are good for Phoenix, unfortunately, there are different market conditions sometimes...

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Which pairs, and you trading Hendrick's time filters or 24 hours?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Well, I am trading EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, EUR/CHF using my own time filter (that is, instead of the last TIMEUNTIL=21, I use TIMEUNTIL=22). Backtesting shows that the timefilter is very important.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Tradeigel, You're GMT+2 also, aren't you?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Phoenix2.1 is still not working for me . Could the server be the problem? There is nothing in the Journak to indicate that there is a problem.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
I'm stumped with your case, Yardie. I'm on SBFX and v2.1 opened 6 trades today so far.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Yardie, maybe you can zip up your set file along with the last 2 copies of both log files - (experts and journal). We can then compare the time line with our own log files.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Where can I find the experts and journal log file in the directory?

--- 帖子 #523 ---
In the terminal window first open the journal then right-mouse-click in the journal and select open. Do the same thing for the alerts tab.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
OK I have attached the zip file with my presets and journal. There is nothing in my alerts tab. Interestingly enough the txt journal is showing trades being executed that didnt actually open...hmmm.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hey Ben, guys,,,,, seems u have the time filters figured out... I want to trade 2am to 12am usa mountain time zone...what time filters do I need to use????????????

--- 帖子 #526 ---
phoenix didn't do so well today. anybody been using trailing stops?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
That would be 2 to 24 in your settings (the first from to setting). leave the other settings at 0.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
NO trades triggered for me today so I cannot say.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
I disabled my trailing stops, instead using TP25, SL50 and I closed the day at 4-1 with 1 floating position at B/E. I have heard that others using the 18pip trailing stop got hit with huge losses today, as well. Might consider a change.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Keep testing at least for this week. And lets share your statement Thanks

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Yardie, It sounds like you don't have live trading turned on.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I do....and its making one or two trades per day. Now there is a euryen position open and a usdyen position was opened and closed in profit overnight. I did get some errors in my log though. I got a few 'old tick" errors. I am using Phoenix 1.1 now. I didnt get these errors when I was using Phoenix 2.1. From my text log with Pheonix2.1 its showing that orders were executed that didnt actually got executed.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I am getting this error in the journal now. Not sure why: 2006.07.26 10:31:43 '22455': modification of pending order #1224770 error 0.04 at 0.0000 sl: 0.0000 tp: 0.0000 -&gt; price: 147.1100 sl: 147.2600 tp: 147.4100 failed [Invalid parameters]

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Yardie, do you have any other eas running with the same magic number?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Nope one EA running. Plus I am having problems with the new broker I am using as well.. Very frustrating. Everything was working beautifully and then as of July 20th problems.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I have a question hopefully someone can help me with. Lets say your in a buy on eur/usd; how can you program it in to not let the usd/chf buy also but instead sell or vice versa because for the most part those 2 pairs usually do the opposite of each other. If it helps I am running the 1.1 version of phoenix but I have modified it some to suit me and needless to say I am pretty impressed with it so far especially it being an EA and not having to constantly look at charts and monitor it all the time. A big thanks Hendricks for all the hard work and a big thanks to anyone who can help me.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
is Phoenix history or what....is anyone doing any good with?????????????????

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I went back to the FirebirdG and MOno's crazy settings and so far I am loving the pips .

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Just Stop It, Alright? It's not helping anybody and if you like spamming then do it in some blog or sth. but NOT HERE!

--- 帖子 #540 ---
What RU talking about???? I"m inquiring info on the status of Phoenix. Take a chill pill dude....................................... We do not need your negitivity, only positive responses r allowed.....

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Agreed. Not sure where this post came from?? Tradeigel, did you incidentally quote the wrong post in your statement above? It didn't make much sense. I've read several of your posts in previous threads, and this doesn't sound like you.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yes I was a bit taken a back myself. Maybe he hadnt sip his coffee as yet.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Maybe it was a little to harsh. i was just annoyed by alsup's comments. Why would you post like 20 unnecessary quotation marks and ask if Phoenix is history?! Well, I guess it's not since we're still posting, right? And I think some other guy already said that he's not reading the thread and posting already answered questions and stuff like that. But anyway, I hope his posts will be more helping in the future.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Good to see you posting agai Tradeigel

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi guys! I thought you all left me! At this moment I'm working hard at Phoenix version 3! It's redesigned from top to bottom. As a teaser I've enclosed a one year backward test for the EURUSD (Modeling quality 90%). Stay tuned. I think Phoenix version 3 will surprise you! I will make this EA only available to those who made or will make a significant contribution to this thread (Tradeigel and Yardie please PM me with your e-mail address).

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hendrick I though you forgot about us! I The backtest results look great 200% return in one year not bad. I would love to see some forward testing results. I will send you my email.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Tradeigel I guess my statements did not meet your expectations. I'm sorry, but I did not mean any dis-respect. No one had been posting and thought people were giving up on Phoenix. For one I think Phoenix is awesome and appreciate everyones imputs to excel it. Yardie has been helpful to me in lots of ways, so txs Yardie. And Hendrix, I would like to be included in your information, and maybe help in just supporting u guys. I'm learning like everyone else. Again sorry if I offended anyone.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi Hendrick, just one suggestion I have is when you backtest I would turn off MM because (at least turn off the Decrease Factor). This skews result often due to different trade sizes. When I backtest I always do fixed lots. Then I compare with MM turned on to see if decrease factor results in better performance. thanks

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Fixed lots is good. I dont like to use MM built into EAs I prefer to do my own MM with fixed lots.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hi Zarni, This is with MM=false and lots=1. Is this what you mean?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hmmm...now that I look at the settings on your backtest I think you are ok. I thought you were using my MM Module which includes Decrease Factor (it reduces trade sizes when it encounters a stretch of bad trades).... I think you may want to add this to the EA as option the way I have it. Just don't backtest using that apart from as a reference. I think MM in general is ok - you never want to trade more than a certain risk percentage and even for backtest that is fine. Just keep the Decrease Factor out and use only for reference just to see how it changes the performance. By the way the last attachment showed MM=true.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Looks like everyone was waiting for someone else to make the first move :-)

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Hendrick, thank you very much for still putting so much effort into Phoenix and including me into the little private group. I'll PM you my email address. alsup: Alright. Thanks for apologizing

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Yardie: Did you ever figure out what the cause of your problems were?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Well I think there was a conflict somewhere. Everything is working now....but not sure what I did to fix it.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I'm wondering if 'somewhere down the road' if you reloaded your demo platform you didn't enable for the EA's to run under your Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Allow for EA's... I'm not which broker you use. Just curious because I had to do that on my demo FXDD account. I loaded it up momentarily on my live account and it was working. As far as FXDD goes, you have to manually select for auto-trading in the options menu; it's defaulted to off.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Oh yes I did all that. In fact it was working before.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hendrick - glad you're back - we all missed you while you were on holiday! I tested Phoenix 2.2(1) from 3 August but... it sits on a $1306 loss right now. I look foreward to a revised version - thanks for your work.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi hendrick, welcome back from your vacation I test phoenix 2.2 with 9pair on demo account and eurusd on real account but it had more looses then winners, thanks for your hard work

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Hey Hendrick -- I thought you might have fallen off the boat or something -- lost at sea, stranded on an island somewhere. Welcome back!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I've only started testing this week but all winners and no losers. Remember to change the TradeFrom and TradeTo times to be in sync with Hendrick's Netherland time.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
This is a 2 months backtest for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 for the EURUSD. As the “behaviour" of pairs is changing during the course of time I'm not interested in backtests for the longer periods. If an EA is back testing well for the last 2 months, 1 month, 2 weeks and 1 week it's ok. Every month you have to use your Strategy Tester to find the right settings (don't worry: I will make a manual for that). As you can see &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; is not making a lot of trades. But the trades it will take, are making money. And that's the main goal of Forex!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Stay tuned, there is more to follow!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (As I told before I will not post &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="3 in"&gt;3 in&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; this thread. You have to PM me with your email and I will add you to my list. It took me weeks, days and hours of blood, sweat and tears to develop this EA and I want to avoid those people that hop by, test Phoenix for a couple of days and then tell me it's a piece of shit).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hendrick those returns are impressive. You have any forward testing data to show as yet?

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hello All, wow...it takes 1 week for me to read, learn and tweaking about EA usage,[from old firebird thread] thanks to you guys, right now i'm testing 1. Firebird fixed_TS 1.0c 2. Pheonix 2.1 it's still early for me....so far so good for Pheonix 2.1 10 win , 0 loss,...i hope i can learn more from FF. p/s sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I am running the forward test on 8 pairs currency on the demo account and will let it run for two days before changing to the next setting. This could be my new post but I have follow the phoenix thread from forex-tsd to here. I beleive good EA deserve more people to help in the testing than reading from the corner.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hey Divinefund welcome to Forexfactory and the Phoenix thread.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Hendrick, One suggestion is can the trailing stop being kick in once the profit is more than 10+trailing stop or another item value min. profit where trailing stop kick in when the profit is more than min. profit + trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
hmm.. i wonder why i did'nt got any trade today.. does anyone has same situation? btw.. i use TF15

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I am using phoenix v2.1 and so far 7 trades are running with 5 negatives and 2 postives in progress status.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hendrick, Any thoughts about putting in code to prevent trading during certain times (i.e. news)? EDIT: oops, am I an idiot or what? Sorry about the stupid comment, I know that there are tradestart and tradestop variables in the EA. I just need to use them! Note to self, think b4 posting and don't post when tired.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Please read the manual and some posts in this thread before asking this question.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
FXDD 3.86 how might you set this up? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Guys, The reason that Phoenix loses with some ones and shows good results with the others is that different Forex Brokers provide different quality of rates. This is because some of them uses cheap traffice and some of them uses expensive traffic. If you compare these 2 traffics you'll see that even candles have different shapes and Indicators show different values. With expensive traffic ticks come more often. This is why Phoenix will give good result only with Forex Broker who provides simmilar rates traffic or with exactly the same one as Hendrick used during tests and development. Sometimes it is impossible to optimize Expert to work if traffic is very different from one it was developed and tested with (I believe in this case we can use one MT (good one) as a data provider to open positions on another one (you have real account with)). You all have to understand that and remember. Before mamking any comments you have to know what settings were used for the pair, what Forex broker was used during development and testings and what time interval it was optimized on. It is obviously that market is changable and optimization should be a regular thing for you. One more thing about Fx brokers is that some of them uses different servers for Demo and Real accounts. I believe there is no reason to have 2 separate servers for Demo and Real, because they both should provide the same rates, but some time rates from demo and real servers are slightly different. This may affect on overal Expert performance. (sorry if somone already mentioned about it) Regards, Dmitri Fixed :-)

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Expert Optimization is not an easy task and mostly very time consuming. This is why I would recommend to run optimization in parrallel on multiple computers/servers. Hendrick, I can help you to speed up this process by loading my servers &amp; computers.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hey Dmitri, I think you are right about the difference in quality of rates. Nevertheless a good EA should not be influenced by that. I will test &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 with another broker than my own (neuimex.com) to find out if this makes any difference.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (Dmitri... is it possible to not use your "red pencil" the next time. It reminds too much to the one my teacher used. No offence buddy ;-)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #576 ---
The work on Phoenix version 3 is in progress. Still have to do a lot of work before I'm satisfied about the behaviour of this version. I have enclosed some backward tests for the EURCHF and the EURUSD to find the right settings. Noticed the difference between these two pairs? (I don't like the Maximal drawdown of the EURUSD). Version 3 will come with the right settings for 12 pairs. Remember that the settings need to be tweaked every 2 weeks! (The results for 1 months and 2 months in my next posts because I can only upload 3 files per post).

--- 帖子 #577 ---
The results for 2 months

--- 帖子 #578 ---
And the results for 1 month

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hendrick how comes these results are different from the ones you published earlier? The result you posted earlier for the eurusd was more impress. Almost triple the starting balance. This one is just over a double.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
It's a amazement ,Felicitation Hendrick

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Testing, testing and testing. The results for the last 6 months, 2 months, 1 month and 2 weeks should be the same: constantly profitable. Thats why there is a difference with the earlier results.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Well so far so good. Keep up the good work my friend .

--- 帖子 #583 ---
It mean that u won't realease the Phoenix version 3 for us to do Forward test? Too bad...

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Just PM me with your e-mail address.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Some more backward tests for the USDJPY (6 months, 2 months and 1 month).

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I like the results I am seeing so far. I cannot wait to forward test. But it seems with Phoenix3 the EA has to hold on to the trade at all times is this correct? What happens if you get disconnected or your computer get rebooted. Does the EA "lose" the trade?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Tests Thanks Hendrick for your valuable work, Phoenix is a more and more impressive EA. I tested Phoenix v2.1 for several weeks on a demo account. It only made wins, so I was satisfied with its performance. Only one thing to mention for investigation: It opened only one trade per pair so in a long trend opening new orders might need a long period of time. I do not know why did it so, perhaps I made something wrong. I would like to take part in testing of the improved version, so I will PM you my email address.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi to all,and thanks Hendrick for the hard work. Realy impressive results . It's been long time just reading thrugh the traed,and now is time to test-first on demo and hopefuly on mini latter. One more time thanks to Hendrick and everybody

--- 帖子 #589 ---
You can use this script to place tester report results on graph. Place your report file into ...\experts\files\ I believe everyone should have this script.

&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt; Phoenix &lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; version 3 work in progress:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Backwards results for the EURUSD for 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months and 4 months. Same results for all the other pairs. Tests for longer periods are not relevant. Why? ... because the pairs are different and the behaviour of pairs are changing during the course of time. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 has different settings for each pair and these settings have to be adjusted every 1 to 2 weeks. I have seen several good ea's that has started most promising but finally blew your account to pieces because they didn’t take the behaviour of the pairs in account. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 is different. As I said before it need to be tweaked every 1 to 2 weeks. Although finding the right settings is a hell of a job I will try to post the settings every 2 weeks (is there someone out there who wants to pay me a lousy 10 bucks a month for all that hard work??).

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi Hendrick, I'll give you $5... No seriously, I think your work is worth more than that. If you'd like to charge for it you should.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hendrick I am sure there would be people here who would pay some kind of fee for an EA that is profitable consistently. I think $10 per month would be more than reasonable. Have you been doing any forward testing at all? ANd does your forward-testing match your backtesting results?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I think the excellent things never be free , I like you and I like your work,too. It's ok to me.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
I´m agree also. there are couple of scams being sold over e bay... that don´t even work!!!. we have here a EA that works, and a guy have put on it a big effort.... that should cost money; and we are all agree in something... we are in the forex because for a extra income (money), so this should have a price. By the way ... modeling quality 90%.... how you do that?

I have done 2days forward test on v2.1 with 8 pairs of currency. I used the default setting as my first test but the result is not up to the mark yet, in the attachment with 20 trades ( ignore first as it is not part of the test ), there are 10 wins and 10 losses. The RR is 50% but the RR ratio in term of profit/oss is about 30%, so the winning factor is 0.3. Perhap some of the setting need to fine tune like SL, TP and time filter. Next week I am going to test it again for 2 days with different setting. N.B so sorry I can't upload the attachment as the forum said it is invalid file type ( html and rar ), I don't know why as I use to upload these type of files before.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Instead of .rar use .zip. WinRAR also can .zip a file.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I have no problem to upload file in other forum. Btw is it member can't upload file when the number of posts is less than 10?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
About 10 posts I don't know; but you are nearly there. The forum owner can forbit certain filetypes. Here they are: Valid file extensions: bmp doc eld gif jpe jpeg jpg mpeg mq4 pdf png psd txt vtscr vttrs zip

Well I just installed winzip and hope it work. The winrar doesn't work except winzip.

From Hendrick : " As I said before it needs to be tweaked every 1 to 2 weeks." Some folks may see this as not a real EA if it has to be fine-tuned every once in a while via human intervention. But, I beg to differ. Because market conditions are always changing with news releases, terror threats (the new news?), or a number of other different 'situations', I don't think any automated trading program will be able to adapt on its own...I take that back, I know of some neural's out there but that is a different subject. Traders, the humans, have to learn from their trading systems, EA's, as well. I believe that is what Hendrick is going through right now with v3.0; learning what it is doing and listening to what it is telling him. Additionally, having to alter a few inputs or parameters every once in a while keeps us in touch with things; the human factor. Think about it, if we let an EA run 100% on its own with no intervention....are we still traders or are we just really playing a slot machine? When Hendrick feels that the time is right for v3.0 to be released we will all be back at square one. Time to relearn what we have learned already and let the EA be the teacher.... Hendrick, it looks as if Hurricane Ernesto is going to miss us here on the beach...That being the case, the ice that was going to be in the cooler to store food is now going back in the blender and the gas the was going to power the generator will be fueling the grill, the key is still under the mat! On to battle!!!!!!!!!

Hey Palmer!! Just what I needed mate!! Cheers (and you will be the first one that will get his hands on Phoenix 3!).

--- 帖子 #604 ---
wait, wait, wait; screw that! I thought I would be the first! Just joking. Well, how's the development going Hendrick? Is there anything I could help you with?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Tradeigel, Testing and changing the code and testing again and changing the code again. And did I mentioned testing and changing the code? Hell of a job, but we are getting somewhere! It needs just a little bit more of time, but then ...Bingo!

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I can see Hendrick the mad scientist in his laboratory now...If you're talking to yourself while in front of the computer...you're in big trouble dude. I'm still teaching myself the language and trying to answer the questions myself. I'm working on a few things as well with the London and New York open and the EUR/USD. I've got a ways to go but I'll pass on the results when I get to that point. Get some rest Hendrick, don't burn yourself out. Good Trading To All

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hi Hendrick, I do understand your determination in ensuring the ver 3.0 with good performance as I have been in computer application for 20+ years. To me at that time it is like a thrill of participating in famous tourement and want to be the first in position. But do take care your health as there is no other important part than yourself.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Don't believe Hendrick to much. I bet he's just browsing the LearJet magazine to see how many pips they cost. Incl. stewardesses ofcourse.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
That is the point of having an EA right? So you can go enjoy life instead of trying to convince your friends and family that somehow this graph is worth $450 to you? Or is that just me again? Good work on the EA Hendrick, proves why I wish I knew how to program .

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I think you overlooked a few smilies

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Although there will be a version 3, does anyone have profitable results from version 2 that you can post? I messed up my news times a couple of days and that has really thrown off my results. dee

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Wish Phoenix EA v3 working very well. I would like to have an forward test. If this EA need to tweak every 1-2month than it will be great. We subscribe to Hendrik for a monthly basic and he will give the tweak to the subscriber. But this really need a forward test.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Myfogo: I believe that is what Hendrick is working on right now. There is no 'release date' for v3.0. Hendrick will give us a head's up I'm sure. I believe he's doing his best to 'listen' to what his code is telling him. It may be weeks or months before we 'see' anything. Composing an EA that produces 'confident' results is what we all would like to have. It's the parameters that need the adjusting to keep the confidence level high. It's like cooking...you want to get it just right before you invite people over for dinner. Good Trading To All

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Question for Hendrick. Being paranoid, I like to forward test settings before I start using them with real cash. That takes a lot of time. Maybe a month. But you plan to release new settings every month. Are those setting well tested or is it gut feeling/experience of what they should be?

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Just a few thoughts on 'tweaking' here...This is a busy week for eco news and currencies. We had a GDP number today, EUR rates/talk tomorrow and non-farm payrolls on Friday. We may only see movement around the news release times = a spike. Some EA's have a hard time with spikes becuause the markets are range-bound and moving averages, MACD's or whatever are usually flat because of the lack of price movement. EA's can get beat to death during days like these so it may just be a good idea to turn them off. I know Firebird (or some versions of it) has a SL of 300 and if you have floating positions that are already down 100 to 150 pips or so around news releases that could really hurt if those stops get hit. I know this isn't anything new to anybody but tweaking parameters beucause of weeks like these is needed. Tighten your stops....

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I believe Hendrick takes no responsibilities for proper settings and money loses. Each optimal settings must be adjusted for specific broker and must be reviewed on a regular basis (at least every 2 weeks). What he gives is a starting point for all of us.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Regards,&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Dmitri

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I'm not saying Hendrick should take responsibility. I always take full reposibility for my own trades But I shall rephrase the question for you. If I have to optimize every 2 weeks. How should I do that in such a short period of time. Just changing something and going live is suicide. So I need to forward test for 2 weeks. And then I need new settings agian And from what I understood from Hendrick it's not just running the optimizer. Or are the new settings always lagging 2 weeks? Hendrick?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hi guys, Some information about the development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; version 3. During the process of developing and testing, and testing and more testing I learned a lot. The idea about adjusting the settings every 2 weeks is not good. An EA should produce always the same results for every pair and for every period; it should be constantly profitable! &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 is not doing this so I decided to drop the whole project. Mind you, it was not a waste of time because I learned a lot about EA's and testing EA's. Now I'm going to start with "nothing" and will try to develop a really good EA. I'm now going to concentrate on my new project and will inform you about my progress. Maybe in this thread (&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4?) or a new thread. My wife just told me I'm addicted to &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. I think she right. And I also think that some kind of addiction and a lot of “blood, sweat and tears" is needed to make something that's really worthwhile. Don't leave this thread and stay tuned!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hey Hendrick, I perfectly understand what you are saying. Looking forward to see what you come up with.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hendrick, All that tried to develop something themself know about the struggle your in. It maybe best to shut dow your PC completly and spend some quality time with you wife. And start again with a fresh mind. Constantly pounding a problem can be counter effective. But I agree with your decsion. Altough I can't really judge Phoenix 3 because I never saw it; but it sounded like curvefitting. And that has a habit of backfiring.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
This brings back memories when I was writing code in EasyLanguage for TradeStation. This was not on a professional level I assure, it was for me mostly. Back then forums like these were not as widespread so I was pretty much on my own. I was constantly making changes to MA's or RSI periods, not optimizing; I was looking for something that worked all the time no matter what. Incidently, as I recall I was working with intra-day data on the SP500, similar to what we use when trading FX. The main thing I found out was that the simpler I kept things, the better the result (backtesting) was. I was mainly using indicator conditions because I wasn't too 'good' at coding price action. But, if I can remember, I believe I stumbled on to something that only produced about 2 or 3 trades a week but the results were very good, results being win:loss ratio. This was on the SP500 ($500 a point), the dollar value return was just as good. But this was when the margin to trade the SP500 was something like $25,000. Uh, I was poor then and I'm poor now. That was more of a hobby and I had and still have that full time job away from home thing. EA's were not 'available' 10 years ago or if they were the real-time data and ability to trade that way in the first place was $$$$$. The point 'I'm trying to get to' is that I kinda burned myself out looking for that one thing that would fit, say, on a corn contract. Nope, what works for one market doesn't necessarily work on another. Different markets have different behaviors. Whether your trading something that has roots and hooves or makes a ching-ching sound in your pocket, they are different. Now, put a corn chart and a EUR/USD chart next to each other without any legends and they look pretty damn similar don't they? But, still they behave differently. I can't answer why the same EA shouldn't produce 'similar' results if the charts looks 'similar', they just don't. It was and still is very frustrating to write code (EA's) for hours on end and come up with, not nothing, because you always learn from doing. But, you do learn what not to do. Writing systems did teach me that just because an indicator is overbought(sold) that the market will turn the other way. Markets can stay overbought(sold) for a long time but indicators don't care. They are all formulated from price action. So, might that be the key??? Price action??? I think it's a lot more difficult to program the price action of a market (behavior) vs. 'IF RSI &gt; 70 THEN SELL'. I applaud Hendrick for working on 'the project' and I doubt very seriously he came away with nothing. He learned something I gaurantee you that. Open up that bottle of red Hendrick and relax for a while. The markets will still be there when you wake up from your slumber. Hope to hear back from you soon. Good Trading To All

Hendrick, Development work is usually hard and contains quick and slow, progressing and retrograde sections. I am happy that you do not intend to give it up rather to develop something new and great. You can do it!

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Palmer, TraderSeven, Yardie and A1Cruiser:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Thanks a lot for all your kind words. I will certainly not give up. I know that all things in live are subject to some kind of law: what goes up must come down and after every winter we can expect a summer. I'm absolutely certain that Forex is subject to its own laws. And that's my goal: study all aspects of Forex and find its "laws". Maybe I will succeed and maybe not. But a least I will try!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Although I think &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will not become "the killer-EA of the century" I will still let it run on my demo-accounts so I can study the trades it made. I will keep you informed about its performance. Here is the statement for week 1.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #625 ---
The results are not bad at all.. But the graph is somewhat odd looking hehe up down up.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
It's extremely hard to figure out something that is profiteble over a longer period of time. Thousands of people on all kind of fora are hammering the same question as you do. Many knowalls know that it sucks because DD is to big or SL is to big and other crap. Kewl to read is books. But offering a solution.... It ain't gonna be easy. Not by a long shot. Maybe you should go back to Firebird; locate it's weakness and strickly concentrate on that.....? Or mix strong points of several EAs. Anyway your Phoenix now officially is a real Phoenix. It did well and it's burned to the ground now. The myth states it rises from his ashes stonger than ever. Make it happen!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hendrick, i'll add my thanks to all the above posters. You have done a good thing by beginning this project. It stimulated some good conversations and many of us have gained much from the activity. Best wishes! Thom

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Hi Hendrick, it's really good that you put so much effort into Phoenix. I agree with you that an EA which always needs new settings isn't good(although self-forward-tuning EA are a nice thing), however I disagree with you that Phoenix has to perform the same with ALL pairs. Every cross has a certain character I think, so different permance is just normal. ;D

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Some update on the the development of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; version 4 (yes.. I killed version 3!). This version is working with a proper money management module (you can find an explanation here http://codebase.mql4.com/273 ). I like it because it keeps the MD as low as possible. It increases the number of lots (and your net profit) when the EA is performing well and decreases them when the EA is not performing as it should be.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Version 4 is very different (maybe I should give it another name than &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;). I have attached 4 reports that show you the importance of money management (all report 90% modelling quality):&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; test 1 MM=true risk 0.02 decrease factor 3&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; test 2 MM=true risk 0.02 decrease=false (MD will increase!)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; test 4 MM=false (more profit but MD will increase)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; test 4 MM=true risk 0.1 decrease 3 (only for the daredevils.. but look at the net profit!).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Good to see you back Hendrick. Although I feel MM/RM is a very important part of a strategy, I think it should not be used when testing an EA. It just obsures results. Any EA that shows profit without MM will improve when you add MM. Just picking some MM isn't wise either. In most cases it will improve performance. But we are looking for peak performance. There are many RM/MM models and settings. Only one works best with your EA/trading style. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
About Money Management: I have noticed that if we open position the same was as Main Trend goes to, we can increase our lot by some %, if we open it against main trend (Moving Average) we better keep it as default value. In addition we can increase our default lot size every extra $$$$ earned. I am playing with one of the multiple EA versions. Unfortunately it shows bad results on historical data. Like they say it empties all account...

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hendrick, downloaded the files and will dig in after my shift! As i post i have 10 copies of MT4 running different EA versions of FB and one other. Some wild times with the market in a trend the last couple of days! Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I read this article, it is very good. I even was in touch with the author of this article, he explained me why we are getting different results with different brokers. But it does not stop me from looking for optimal solution. I believe that as long as market is very changeable it worth to look for optimal parameters on regular basis or to make a set of optimal parameters based on current market status. I think in order to get the best result it is better to use Tenforex as a data provider (they provide real time high quality rates, sometimes several ticks a second, I run trial account with them, for those who is interested I can give one month rates) and MT as a decision maker. The only one problem is that I do not have a MetaTrader Server which cost about 40K (already 20K, I found one guy to share the price with , but it is still expensive) and would receive rates from Tenforex AS THEY IT IS. The more often you receive ticks the better decision you can take, even candle analysis works very well.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; My idea is to make a single control center for MTs of different brokers, using DLLs and primitive experts they would receive BUY/SELL commands from it. This would allow me to optimize expert only for one data provider. Why different brokers? Because they say: “ never put all the eggs in one basket ”….&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hi All, My greatest admiration and respect for your abilities, hard work, patience and generosity - especially Hendrick. I have looked at and tested Firebird, and also Phoenix with very mixed results. But, like you guys, I believe "the answer is out there." I understand the various concepts you are trialling, but as you all know they will work sometimes but not consistently. I have always thought a large stop loss is very dangerous. And, if the system is left unattended a relatively large T/P is unrealistic too! IMHO, perhaps smaller T/P &amp; S/L because if you win on a reversal as you are trying to do, "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," but also if the reversal does not happen, you have minimised your loss? Sorry if you've already "been there - done that" Congratulations and thanks from an "admirer from afar . . ." Kind Regards, Grahame. PS. My whole aim is to encourage you!

--- 帖子 #639 ---
currently i'm using FB. and i was wondering, no one implement money management in it, modifying the s/l and t/p as it's in profit. after searching using the word money management, i found this. why didn't i read this thread?!!! i don't even know there's another EA (Phoenix) from FB. good luck with the phoenix 4, hopefully, you'll post it here. i can't wait to test it

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Hendrick Thanks a lot for all your efforts and sharing. Could you tell me what the latest version of phoenix is so far and what the link for download is. On the first page we only have version 1; you mentioned at some stage that all versions would be posted on the first page which is a great idea. Thanks again. Howard

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Howard, versions of firebird are available at Accrete's website .

An update on the progress of the developing the latest version of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; versions 1 and 2 were not performing to well. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 3 was a disaster. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4… well I think we’re getting somewhere. First I tried to make some kind of universal EA. Useful for all pairs and for all times. It was no success: pairs are different and their behavior will change during the course of time. I have seen some good EA’s that performs excellent in the beginning but failed after some time. The cause of this in my onion is that tweaking an EA is always a thing of the past. It will act according the backtests for some time, but there will always be a change in the future and the EA with the “old” settings will fail.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; At the moment I’m not capable to make an EA that will adjust itself. I’m still studying the subject and who knows, maybe version 5 will have some AI built in.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 will come with the right settings for 12 pairs. You may expect that most pairs will act according these settings for the next 4 weeks. After that the settings for some pairs have to change. Don’t worry I will post the new settings ever 4 weeks.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I need just a little bit mote time to make &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 available to “the public”. To get an impression I’ve enclosed some backtests.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #643 ---
There he is. What's been happening? Phoenix looks to be getting a little closer all the time brother Hendrick. "Free your mind and the rest will follow." I put some more shrimp on barbie this weekend and this time I had company ;-) I'm trying to put together a range breakout thingy, getting a little friendlier with MQL little by little. Hope the live trading has been treating you well. Good to 'hear' from you....

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Hi, Hendrick. Finally, you're back! The backtesting results look awesome! I really look forward to v.4.x!

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hey Palmer!, And.. how was your company?? I bet she liked the shrimps! I will send you the beta of Phoenix 4 this weekend. Hope you will help me testing. Until now it's doing very well. See you buddy!

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi Tradeigel!! You are really a loyal visitor of this thread! If you agree I will send you the beta version of Phoenix 4 this weekend. I think I have your e-mail address, but to be certain please PM me this one more time. I think you and Palmer can help me to find the right settings before I post the final version in this thread.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hendrick, I like your approach to auto-trading and if there's anything I can do to help developlent, research, demoing or just some grunt work, please advise. Don't know if this is applicable to your project, I've done some work on auto adjusting EA. Wackena

It was the first date me cook dinner for her thing. I'm pretty good in the kitchen so she was impressed with that one. Either way we had a good time and I'm pretty sure there will be a second date. In addition to the grilled shrimp there was saute'd scallops in a five cheese casserol, grilled red peppers and steamed asparagus topped with Parmasan cheese along with a nice bottle of Chianti. I'll PM you the dessert recipe, gotta keep that one a secret...

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Once the P4 is available, i will also forward test on several pairs as i've got plenty of horsepower to go around. Currently have 5MT4 copies running various pairs. I absolutely believe AutoTrading is here to stay. And so far FB/Phoenix are the winners when a bit of time-filtering of trading action is in the mix. . . Also Hendrick, if you will let me know if it is ok to post the P4 once available at the resource page i can get that up there along with anything else you feel might help with understanding the model. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Accrete, you've done a great job with all the Firebird resources. Thanks for your help. I've been testing so many versions and settings of Firebird I'm just about crazy now. But I really look forward to a new version of Phoenix. I've got a couple of spare platforms ready to rock and roll (test that is) right now!

--- 帖子 #651 ---
traderone, thx for the kudos...it's all fun. On the testing, i can feel your pain. Haha. My hard drive is filling up with all the statements from various tests. I've got lots of crazy EA names like 63gH03ind, 65tf15m and stuff like that just to try to keep things straight. Won't it be grand when the dust settles and we find ourselves making some consistent pips? Cheers, Thom

Hi Hendrick Once again thank you for all the work you have in hand. I have 2 versions of FB and the previous version of Phoenix running alongside each other and await Ph4 to be added as well. keep up the good job. Regards howard

In the first place it has nothing to do with Firebird (so please don’t discuss Firebird in this thread) and secondly it’s completely different from &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 1, 2 and 3.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; For &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 I’ve tried a different approach: whatever strategy you are using, they have all one thing in common: you’re studying the past in order to predict the future. &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 is not different from that, only with one exception: optimum settings! With optimum settings I mean a special mix between, Number of Trades, Net Profit and Maximal Drawdown. When you have found these settings for lets say the last 6 months and you have a smooth upwards curve (the past) you may expect that for the coming weeks (the future) this upwards curve will continue and the EA will make more winners than losers. And that’s what we want an EA to do! &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; A lot of EA’s I’ve seen had the same problems: fixed settings that worked for the past but if the settings will not be adjusted the EA will fail sometime in the future ( Firebird is an example of this).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; On all the forums there is a lot of talking about the “holy grail”. In my opinion Metatrader with its ability to make Experts Advisors, is the grail and you only have to make the right EA with the right settings (and adjust them in time!) to make it a “ holy grail”. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; One thing I’ve discovered is, that by tweaking the settings of an EA you are able to discover strategies you have never heard of before! These are all new strategies and only possible to discover by using Metatrader! If you are back testing you have the possibility to open a chart after testing. I did it several times for &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 and it showed me nothing! It was a complete mess! But still it has this straight upwards curve and &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 made a lot of money in these 6 months. How is this possible? It’s possible because there are a lot more of strategies in Forex than taught in all these Forex-books and you have now the possibility to discover these strategies by using the power of your PC and the Expert Advisors of Metatrader!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Ok this is my point, so now you can shoot at it.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Let me give some examples: I’m using a TP=42 and a SL=84 for all pairs (I will explain later why I’m doing this) and nowhere in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 have I programmed something like resistance and support lines. But if I’m looking at my open trades, I see that SL and TP are functioning as support and resistance lines. Weird, not? So it seems that the EA has made its own strategy. Stay tuned and more tomorrow! I think we can have a lot of fun with &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4!!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hi Sinclap It should be working fine on a mini account, but I have to test the code for that on a live account.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
[quote=raven] By adjusting the settings for a pair you eventually will end up with "the perfect upward curve" and that's what you may call the ultimate strategy for this pair (for a limited time span!!). It seems to work!

Hello Hendrick .. I just want to say THANX a lot for what u r giving us &amp; we hope Phoenix 4 become the greatest &amp; we'r waiting for it .. God be with you . Thanx Man .

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hendrick, I have been reading this thread with real interest and I am waiting with bated breath for Phoenix 4. I am new to EAs and I'm glad I came across this thread early on in the piece. Glad to see some people are still sharing great things on this fourm May the pips be with!

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hendrick, I was thinking of trying something that sounds similar to what you are talking about. My plan was to have multiple forward tests in progress feeding into database that filtered out the best current settings. Basicly an ongoing forward optimisation test. I would map the progress of the settings over time to see if the best ones had changed and then switch the live account to them. There would be a bit of lag between when new settings were performing best and when they are confirmed. I suspect this is what many people do at the moment manually, but i guess where my approach would be different is it would be using a database to track things over time and get daily reports on current trends for the settings. I was thinking this would give better results than back testing regularly. Hendrick, Is this similar to what you are doing with phoenix 4? Regards thebts

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hi thebts, Your idea sounds interesting. I'm still using the old fashioned way. If it's possible then please tell me more about your idea.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I do a manually backward test for the last 6 months for every pair. If there's a smooth upward curve from the beginning till the end then it's ok to use the settings. Every 4 weeks I do the same test again. If the curve is going downwards at the end I do a new backward test for the last 3 months to find better settings. Works ok for now.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Of course all tests needs a modelling quality of 90%&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #664 ---
It's not something i have had time to do, but here is what i was thinking of: Along side the live account i would have a number of demo accounts collecting forward testing data in a database. Each demo account would run a number of different settings and pairs. To keep the number of demo accounts down i would probably use multiple magic numbers on the same pair. This is really like your forward version of MT4's optimisation test. Along with recording the actual settings used in the database I would automaticly collect data such as: max draw down of a trade, number of hours open, dates, profit/loss, etc. To do this i would build it into the ea to log to a database all this information. With all this feeding into a database i would be collecting a lot of info. There would be some reports that i would run each day looking for patterns and mapping any trends in what settings are working best. I was thinking of some 3D models here, but there would be a number of ways to show the collated information. Last time i looked MT4s analysis capabilities of backtesting data were pretty limited, what i had imagined would be much more comprehensive with the ability to map and filter on all the extra info i have collected. Hopefully it would provide enough feedback to adjust the settings on an ongoing basis. Once it is set up the main leg work would be keeping your demos running and maybe adding new settings to test.

Hendrick, I am impressed by your observations and way of thinking! I think you are near to invent something great. Thanks, A1Cruiser

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Just a word about tweaking here. This is a daily chart of the EUR/USD with a 10 period average true range plotted. The higher the ATR = the more price movement, from the high to low of the day. The boxes on the ATR show a low ATR and high ATR time period. I'm working on a range breakout system that uses a predetermined take profit level. If I see that the ATR trend is on the rise then I may increase my TP level. If I see that the ATR is going down, I may lower my TP level. Is this tweaking? Yes. But, how do you know when to adjust your EA parameters? If a backtest on three years of data shows that the max consecutive losses was say, 7. And, you have a current consecutive loss of 5 trades should you be concerned? I don't think so. If you hit 10 in a row then it's time to change your parameters. I think the main question is trying to figure out when to tweak things. Whatever Hendrick is brewing with P4 I'm sure it will be a great piece of work. There may be some that question why should any EA have to be 'tweaked' and the answer is simple. It's because price action alone dictates how an EA will perform. If there is a global economic summit meeting for 5 days and there is no eco news to be released during that same week, no earnings releases, terrorist or oil news I would expect the ATR to be low. I would tweak my take profit zone to the low end because of the probable lack of movement in the markets during that week. It's basically the same as shutting off your EA before a NFP release or FOMC statement. I'm just throwing in my 2 cents here. Good Trading To All

Hey Palmer! I fully agree with you tweaking-story. Tomorrow I will send you the BETA of Phoenix 4 with a lot of twaeking inside. Hope you can test it for the coming weeks.

Statement first week with &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; 4.2. First impression: I think &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4 and the JPY likes each other very much. I'm now testing all pairs for another week to see which pairs are most suitable. Let's see how it goes! For the rest: well, I think it's not too bad for one week. This weekend more work to do: I will tweak the settings for most pairs to see if there's more profit to obtain.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; (Palmer: aside testing &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; I will definitely test your strawberries this weekend!)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hendrick, These are really impressive results! If this kind of profit level can be stabilized (in average and approximately, naturally) that is really worth the tweaking periodically.

Let’s talk about MetaTrader Strategy Tester, the Past, the Future and &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; &lt;st1:metricconverter w:st="on" ProductID="4. In"&gt;4. In&lt;/st1:metricconverter&gt; my previous posts I told you that there are more strategies possible in Forex than written in all the Forex-books in the world. I think strategies are not the right word. Laws or rules is a better word. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; I’m one of these guys that believes that everything in this world is subject to rules and laws. If you hold an apple and drop it will fall to earth. It did the same in the past and it will do so in the future. That’s the law of gravity. Forex in general is also subject to laws and rules. We still don’t know what these laws and rules really are, but we can see the effects. The same is valid for gravity: we know that the apple will fall down, bit the real nature of gravity (and electricity, and magnetism etc etc) is still unknown. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; When we study are charts (the past) we are trying to predict the future from that. What we really do is studying the effects of the rules and laws of Forex. Is it really necessary to know the laws and rules of Forex? No! Studying the effect is all we have to know. Back to the apple again, we don’t know the real nature of gravity, but what we do know is the apple will fall down. It did the same in the past and will do the same in the future (I hope).&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; When you are using the Strategy Tester of MetaTrader you sometimes discover settings that gives a completely different effect than the settings nearby. That’s the moment that you discovered the effect of one off the Laws of Forex (the apple fall down). In the tester you have the ability to open a chart after a test. In this case you probably will see nothing. It all looks like a complete mess. And this is my point: a lot of Forex strategies are hidden, can’t see on the chart, but they do reveal them in the tester.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; And that’s the idea behind &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4: keep on testing and adjusting the settings until you have a smooth up going balance-curve. There’s no doubt about it that this balance-curve will continue in at least the coming four weeks. My forward tests shows me that I’m on the right track. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Palmer, you won't believe this! My green-grocer couldn't deliver strawberries today. I told him about Forex, &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;, Palmer and your recipe and he didn’t have a clue where I was talking about (well, I can't blame him). He did however promise me to deliver the strawberries next week.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I will mail the BETA-version of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 to you within the coming hour. I hope you can test this one on a demo-account in the coming week. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Let’s discuss your findings in this thread.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; When using on a demo-account:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PrefSettings=true&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MM=true&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; For testing:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PrefSettings=false&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MM=false &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; You're the first one Palmer!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Some more information about using &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Use TimeFrame=15M&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; For demo/live account:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Check in your settings if PrefSettings=TRUE. In that case &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will use the settings from the code. You can use the followings pairs:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; USDJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCHF, GBPCHF, AUDUSD, EURCHF, EURJPY, GBPJPY, CHFJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Until now I think USDJPY, GBPJPY and EURJPY are the best pairs to start with.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; For testing you have to use PrefSettings=FALSE. In your strategytester you have the following settings:&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Lots = 1; Only used when MM=false&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MaximumRisk = 0.05; Is used when MM=true&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; DecreaseFactor = 3; If MM=true the EA will decrease lots when your consecutive losses &gt; 1&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PrefSettings = false;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MM = true; I strongly advise you to use Money Management&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; AccountIsMicro = false;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TakeProfit = 0; My Favorite TP=42&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; StopLoss = 0; My Favorite SL=84&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; TrailingStop = 0; I don’t use a TS&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; UseSignal1 = true; You can switch on and off 5 signals.

PrefSettings = true, MM= false, so P4 used all your original settings. But in your settings TrailingStop was "0", I added TrailinStop =5 ,TP and SL not in PrefSetings but at the begginig of P4 code. I don't know why EA used this TrailingStop (1 position). Today 3 open positions -804 balance = 5816.

Hi Darecki, The settings I gave earlier are "in balance" for each pair. If you change the TP, SL or TS that’s ok, but you have to tweak the settings until the pair is in balance again. I advise you to use the settings I gave earlier for the time being&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Hey Apple, Don't rush Phoenix! For some pairs it will not place many trades. You have to let it run for a couple of weeks before it shows you its full potential (I hope). Try my latest settings for the EURUSD and the GBPUSD. They will give you more trades. Keep us posted!

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hi Wackena!! Great to have you in this thread! I really appreciate it. I had some very good trades today. At the moment I have a BUY on the CHFJPY that's trying to reach my TP. Just a little bit more and I have another winner. Two hours earlier &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; opened a BUY for the EURUSD (New settings) that's in profit now.

I’ve send a lot of people a copy of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 to play with. But until now only a few of you has shared his or hers results. I find this rather disappointing. This is a community of sharing: sharing your EA’s, sharing your opinions, sharing your results, sharing your whatever, but share! I can only improve &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; with your help. Without your help &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; will return to its ashes! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; Some of you send me PM and told me that you rather not post to this thread because your English was too bad. Well, I perfectly understood your English! I’m Dutch and look at my English! We are not interested if you be fluent in this language (I looked this up in a dictionary!), we are interested in your opinion about &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt;! So, don’t be shy and post your results and opinion.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hendrick i have a question does the phoenix has to be started at a certain time or it runs 24/7?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi mniemiec, Welcome to this thread! It will trade 24 hours a day if you use TradeFrom1=0 and TradeUntil1=24! Keep us posted with your results! Hendrick.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Today performance 26 sept. I have lowered all tp to 30pips, and changes setting for all pair base on ej setting. Gj is using Hendrick's new setting. Phoenix only open 1 position for GJ. gj: closed +42 ej: +14 (still open since monday...4.2 default setting)

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Hi Ijal!! The settings I posted before are balanced. I'm not sure that if you change TP, SL or TS this balance will stay intact. I think you better do a couple of tests to check if you have the same upwards balance-curve! Greetings, Hendrick.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I've had Phoenix 4.2 running since Sunday night on Alpari on all 12 pairs with Hendrick's settings. Not looking too good as yet. Starting with $10k on 1 lot (no money management) the current balance is $8629. There are 3 trades open totalling -$444 giving equity of $8184. All updates of the pairs have been implemented.

thanks , could you upload us your statement file plz~

Hello Hendrick, I'm running Phoenix 4.2 on 3 Metatrader platforms: FXDD, NEXTT and Multibank. I started first on NEXTT with a normal account and one day later I saw that nothing happend. What was the reason? On a normal account they do not accept trades with minilots. So I changed to a mini account, and voilà, now it's going on. What I also realized is, that the trades are not all identic, this show as again that all depends on the brokers data and also the spread must be taken in consideration. All forward testing were started with default settings as delivered by you. Attached are my results. Regards mamba22

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi Mamba, Thanks for your contribution. And you're absolutely right about brokers. So if anyone posts results then don't forget to mention your broker.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Hendrick.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hi Hendrick I started my testing only this morning (27/9). I wondered, should I not attach Phoenix to the 5 min chart to see how it performs? It does not realy make sense if all of us use exactly the same settings and timeframes to test. Your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi Benna, Of course you can try &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; on M5 charts. On the other hand the combination of a pair, its timeframe and all the settings are "in balance". It means that if you change one of these you have to use your Strategy Tester to find the new balance. Be aware that this process is very time consuming! &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

2nd report after 2.5 days on North Finance Demo on 12 pairs on M15 chart. Balance - 10,623.99 Equity - 10,715.35 Attached are results, chart graphic and settings .doc. Wackena

--- 帖子 #716 ---
So far so good Wackena! Next week I will start a new demo with only the JPY. For some reason the JPY is performing much better than the other currencies.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
If you are testing &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 then please pay attention to the following:&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt; A pair, its timeframe (M15) and the settings are all in balance. The settings I gave earlier are the result of a lot of testing. With these settings you should get the maximum Net Profit, the lowest Maximal drawdown and a reasonable number of trades. If you change anything be aware of the fact that &lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:City&gt;&lt;/st1 lace&gt; is out of balance and you probably don’t get the results you want. If you still want to use other settings then you have to use your Strategy Tester to find the balanced settings again. Testing have to be done by the book, is very time consuming and you will easily find yourself on the wrong track. But on the other hand you might discover settings that are much more profitable than the old ones.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #718 ---
If you want to use the Strategy Tester of MT4 to test different settings for Phoenix 4.2, I can highly recommend you this article: http://articles.mql4.com/192

Hi Hendrick and everyone, I am getting ready to take phoenix 4.2 live on my FXDD account. I have been testing it for a few days now on the chf/jpy , gbp/jpy, usd/jpy, eur/jpy with your settings. What pairs would you suggest on 1000.00 mini account? If all goes well I will deposit more funds to trade more pairs. It seems with jpy pairs phoenix does really well and with the eur/usd and chf/usd the firebird 63g ts does really well on those 2 pairs. Let me know what you suggest and I will keep everyone posted of the results. Thanks for all your hard work. Valerie......

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I started the test this morning (Sep 27) at 8 o'clock GMT on three Japanese pairs: USDJPY, EURJPY and GBPJPY. The broker is Velocity4x, account opening balance USD 5000, leverage: 100. I use the default settings on M15 timeframe. MM: true, risk: 0.02 There are two trades so far: 09:15 sell 0.10 lot USDJPY @ 117.15 currently -25.54 10:30 sell 0.10 lot EURJPY @ 148.97 currently -22.13

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Valerie, Please wait for Phoenix 4.3. Version 4.2 is for testing only and need some additions before you can take it live.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Changing the settings of the GBPJPY was not a good idea. So change the GBPJPY to the following settings: SMAPeriod = 14; SMA2Bars = 2; Percent = 0.025; TakeProfit = 42; StopLoss = 84; TrailingStop = 0; OSMAFast = 11; OSMASlow = 26; OSMASignal = 6; EnvelopePeriod = 5; Fast_Period = 12; Slow_Period = 20; DVBuySell = 0.0045; DVStayOut = 0.021;

Hi Mike, Did you changed some settings? If so, will you show me your settings?

Hi Hendrick, I have all pairs as you suggested, including the latest updates. I have now reset the account and started again. Will keep you updated. Mike4x.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Mike, If I were you I would use MM=true for your forward test. Try for a start all the pairs with the JPY. I think the other pairs needs a little bit more of tweaking. Keep us posted!

Hi Vlaka, That's a nice starter! Your statement and all the others are some kind of prove that Phoenix 4.2 and the JPY is a perfect match. I'm sure we will find the right settings for all the other pairs. Keep us posted Vlaka!

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi Wackena! From your attachments (very professional!) I see that you have converted your statements to an Excel-sheet. Can you please show me how you've done that? Is it some kind of tool? I'm very curious about it!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Thanks Hendrick I will be patiently waitng and testing with 4.2 just let me know when you give the green light. Thanks a bundle....Valerie......

hello Phoenix fans .. About the Stop Loss in Phoenix 4 , dont u think guys that 84 pips are TOO MUCH ??? In REAL account a 84 SL could be a problem , and we all know that the market can move easily 100 pips a day .. So what do u think ?? And could someone tell me plz how to change phoenix lots to 1 full lot !! I've changed it from 0.1 to 1.0 , but it's still the same . Thanx .

--- 帖子 #735 ---
After your produce the report in the MT4 platform, start excel, click open, select file of type=all files, find .htm report file and open. Then all I do is XXXXX out my name and account number and then select all to reduce font size to 8 pt. Wackena

New settings for the USDCAD: SMAPeriod = 2; SMA2Bars = 2; Percent = 0.0036; TakeProfit = 60; StopLoss = 65; TrailingStop = 0; OSMAFast = 3; OSMASlow = 10; OSMASignal = 3; EnvelopePeriod = 4; Fast_Period = 5; Slow_Period = 10; DVBuySell = 0.0005; DVStayOut = 0.001;

--- 帖子 #738 ---
you would have to turn MM=FALSE (That's Money Management switched off). However, we don't advise you to! For 84 S/L: I don't like that either. I think it's to much for m15 but... And btw, to have a T/P which is half the S/L is not a very good idea I think - just look at the risk:reward threads in the forum... Of course, the backtesting results are better with such a high S/L... :/

I agree it is a little uncomfortable but that being said phoenix has to have room to breath for the trade to develope sometimes. I may try adding a little more to the stoploss but only on a case by case basis to see how it plays out. Just my thoughts....Valerie......

Hi A1Cruiser, I had the exact same position on EURJPY so when I noticed it getting close to the stoploss I upped to 150.0 and it seems the price is going down now. I am waiting to see what happens next. Just my 2 cents.....

Hello Hendrick, I'd like to thank you for the copy of P4. It's already installed in my PC and i'd like to start testing Sunday. I will share my results with everyone.

Hi Amaruenterprise, Well, it can be done. But I am on a demo with Phoenix and I think testing the Stop Loss settings is a part of the game. On my experiences with other EAs, I personally think that bigger Stop Loss values should be used at Phoenix as well but we will see as a result of our collective experiment here.

Hedrick, First week statement for the new Phoenix is attached. Brief summary: Traded the JPY pairs you recommended with settings you suggested (all updated). 11 pairs opened trades: 4-USD/JPY; two losses. 5-EUR/JPY; two losses. 2-GBP/JPY; no losses. There was no float at the end of the week. My initial capital was $5112. Total loss for the week was $182.02. Some suggestions: It would be very helpful if you updated/revised your manual on Phoenix. I know it has evolved into something different than when you started. This would help us to understand how it works and knowing that would help us all work together to optimize it. You tell us that changing SL, TP and other parameters would throw the pairs "out of balance." We need to have a deeper understanding about your ideas and theories on Phoenix so that we can help you develop it. As it stands now it looks like Phoenix's stop loss is too low and take profit too high. I think these need to be changed but we need to know how to keep the pairs "in balance" as you say. Thanks for all your work, by the way. Just my two cents... 1 Trader2

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hi, Thanks for your contribution. I will make the necessary changes to the manual for &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; as soon as possible. Maybe I will start a new thread because &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 4.2 is so different from the previous versions. I will just wait for the results of my forward test this week. If these are ok, I will continue the development and will make a fresh start with a new thread .

Hedrick, Kind of seems like a cop out to me...we have only been exposed to the new Phoenix for one week. That's hardly enough time for people even to discover it let alone ramp up to test it. As I mentioned in my previous post, you haven't even explained to us how it differs from the previous version or what it is even based on. I think you need to gives us a little more time and you need to be patient...just my 2 cents...with all due respect... 1Trader2

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I think you're right. I just need some time now to make up my mind about a couple of things: will I continue developing Phoenix, is it better to start a new thread etc. I will be back.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi Hendrick We did test Phoenix with the previous settings and every body reported the performance. I have entered the new settings which you posted yesterday and started the test again. Regards Howard

It gives me the courage to continue the development of &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;. &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Although the USDJPY is doing very well, I think I've found better settings for this pair. Someone out there that's willing to test these settings? You will find the settings at top of the report.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Congratulations, Hendrick to the championship! You are under the TOP 10. That's great! I wish you further much luck!!! I will change the settings in the EA, how you suggested, and give it a try. mamba22

--- 帖子 #776 ---
I just started a test on USDJPY with the new settings. The default in Phoenix is set equal to the following setting from your backtest report? Correction1=0;

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Thanks nvwine. The settings from the test report are the right ones (The value Correction is not used in the EA).

--- 帖子 #778 ---
I need another tester to forward test new settings for the EURJPY. You will find the new settings at the top of the test report.

Hi Hendrick, Will now begin forward testing of "EURJPY 1005." Will tell when anything happens. Regards, Grahame

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi Hendrick, Trial has started. I assumed that "Correction" and "xfactor" were the same and have set "xfactor" to 0 accordingly. Trust this is correct. Regards, Grahame

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hendrick, Please advise. When you request a pair to be tested do you want a test with only that pair? or Can I test several pairs with new settings on the same demo account? Thanks

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Correct Graham!

--- 帖子 #784 ---
You can test several pairs on the same account. But I'm particularly interested in the results for the USDJPY en EURJPY with the new settings &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; .

As of Oct 5, 2006 at 12:30 EDT, Hendrick is in 4th Place in the Automated Trading Championship 2006. It is a day at a time, but so far your EA is performing great. Wackena

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Go Hendrick!!

--- 帖子 #789 ---
This weekend I will give a more comprehensive observation about the performance of Phoenix 4.2 until now. If I leave out the losers AUDUSD and EURAUD the starting balance of 5.000 has grown to 7.675 in less than 3 weeks. This gives me enough confidence to continue the development. And looking at the latest results of the "Automated Trading Championship" my Phoenix is now on the 4th place. I take another glass of wine on that!! Best pairs until now are: CHFJPY, EURCHF, EURJPY, USDCAD and USDJPY. And there is a lot more to improve!

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hendrick, nice to see that your Phoenix has matured and wish you the best at the competition.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Thanks Umax (Rotterdam is niet zo ver van Alphen aan den Rijn!)

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi Hendrick, I am posting this message here and not sending a PM so that others may learn what has happened. I opened a new DEMO account for $10K with IBFX especially to trial your "EURJPY 1005" and started with your new paramaters as you requested. Then, so as to give your "new" EA the best unhindered chance to operate, I went back to my other demo account and closed a couple of other EA's I had running. I did not realise that turning off the Expert Advisor "master switch" at the top acted on all accounts - not only on the "open" account on the screen. So, I inadvertantly turned your new baby off as well. I discovered this at 6am local time (Australia), and reactivated it immediately. So, we've lost about 4 hours. Sorry. So, in case others did not know, turning Expert Advisor "master switch" on or off acts on ALL EA's on ALL accounts - not just the account that's open on your screen. Hope this has helped and not confused anyone. Kind Regards, Grahame

--- 帖子 #793 ---
so if i log off one accoutn that is running a EA, and log into another account, the one that is logged off still takes new trades? I didn't think it kept making new trades while logged out.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hi Stricko108 &amp; Hendrick, I'm not sure. But, I have just checked the status of Hendrick's "EURJPY 1005" which I have recently reactivated after accidentally turning it off and it appears to be in limbo. What I have is this: Expert Advisors "master switch" is ON. "EURJPY 1005" is turned ON on the "common" tab. AND I have the smiley face in the top right corner BUT the Journal tells me "Experts are disabled because account has been changed" OH . . . . . I don't believe it! It has just opened a trade (I am running 2 computers and it is on the other one.) EXCELLENT! We're officially under way with "EURJPY 1005", Hendrick! Regards to All, Grahame

--- 帖子 #795 ---
It has not been 24 hours but I like to print the report around 0 GMT if I am near my computer. This test is for the new setting on USDJPY - the open trade. NOT the closed EURJPY which is the old settings. I opened the account the same time I made post #776 the USDJPY trade opened in the first 10 minutes after starting Phoenix.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Here is the second test I started today. This test uses the new test settings for both USDJPY and EURJPY. I started this test just before I made post #782 to the thread. The first trade opened a few hours later.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Any kind of help please!!!!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hi Takaya, One of the sub-folders of the folder where you installed MT4 is called "logs". Open the latest log-file and look if you can find more information about this error.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hi Hendrick, I just started test on $/Jpy. Sell just hit @0215 cst. Bid;118.13. Although the sell hit whilst I was inputing new parameters and I had a smiley; after clicking 'ok' for inputs the smiley went frowny. But trading is still actively moving. TTYL, Kevin

I got my IBFX mini account to start trading micro and smaller lots with Phoenix. This post is based on trading micro and smaller lots on a mini account with 'InterbankFX'. I do not know if it is applicapable to other mini accounts with a micro lot option. I am a poor cut and paste, trial and error programmer so wait for other opinions before following my suggestions. There might be better or easier ways to fix the problem. With an IBFX mini account you enter lots=1.0 to trade a 10K lot, lots=0.10 to trade a 1K micro lot, and lots=0.01 to trade a $100 lot. You can not go out to a 3rd decimal or you get an error. So I had to make a few changes in the parameters as noted in the zip file. I also set AccountIsMicro to false. IBFX mini accounts label currency pairs 'EURUSDm' rather than 'EURUSD' like regular accounts. Phoenix needed the little 'm' added to each pair in the code to work with a mini account. See zip file. Phoenix has now opened 3 trades $400 lot each with a $250 balance since I made the changes to the currency names and the following changes: extern double MaximumRisk = 0.19; lot=NormalizeDouble(AccountFreeMargin()*MaximumRisk/1000.0,2); if(lot&lt;0.01) lot=0.01; MaximumRisk is one word above but I can't get it to stay together.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hendrick I did not post replies up to now because I waited for Phoenix to take off. At this stage it is still on the runway. It hit some water and is a few feet under now... I hope it will surface soon and then take off. I am positive! I started it on 26/09 with all your settings (updated as you sent it) on USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, and USD/CHF. Deposit $5000 Equity $4765 Float -$47 The float always stayed low - a very good sign. I have problem understanding to ZIP files. (Using CAMUnzip) My head is hurting trying. Once I got it I will send the files. Ben

When I checked the Automated Trading Championship 2006, Hendrick was in 2nd Place. Hendrick's, no matter what happens next, you should be very proud of this work. Just thnk of it, at this moment, you are the 2nd best MT4 programmer in the world. Big Congrats. Wackena

You got me blushing there Wackena! Mind you, it's still a long time till the end of the contest. Many thanks for your statements. As usual very professional. I've tried to convert the statement to an Excel file but got a very different result than your Excel file. Are you using some kind of template for this?&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

I am at lost here. Backtesting only gives blanc Backtesting other EA's works just fine with Alpari data, but somehow it just won't do anything with Phoenix. Started forward testing at IBFX and FXDD. Sofar 1 trade opened at FXDD but nothing at IBFX. Somehow every EA I tested works better at FXDD. Got to do with the tighter spread of FXDD while IBFX often changes the spread without reason. Is there more information about what Phoenix 4.2 exactly do? I have Phoenix manual v.1.0 I assume that it is a little different because the results are not the same anymore.(in a positive way ) 2nd place at championship now, GO GO GO!!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hi guys, I just purchased a laptop to be able to work away from home and to watch trades when I'm not at my desktop... it's functioning quite well thank you. Something is happening that I can't quite resolve regarding the backtesting. When I'm runnng backtests of P4 on the desktop there's no problem. The alpari data is fine and there are good results however after duplicating the setup for MT4 exactly in every respect, the backtests return very few trades, there are very few bars modeled and the modeling quality rarely exceeds 40-50%. I've tried reloading the data, etc., to no avail. Anyone with a helpful suggestion will be held in the highest regard. Oh and congratulations Hendrik. P4 is kicking butt in the competition! Joe

--- 帖子 #808 ---
MT4 is really picky about its history files... I have many problems with the history files and backtesting too. Best solution I have found is to manually go into the charts for each time setting and make sure you can scroll back in time through the entire history of your backtest without MT4 trying to download the charts from the server. If it is trying to download the charts from the server rather than your harddrive, it is missing data. Once you get those gaps filled in, you should be able to get your backtest to operate properly. ... lot of work, i know. But its what I had to do. Nothing else seemed to work. GirlFlyer

Good going so far Hendrick with Phoenix at the competition. Hope it keeps it up! GirlFlyer

Hi Hendrick, Results for EURJPY 1005: SELL opened at 2006/10/05 @ 21:02 @ $149.39. Went the wrong way up to $149.82 then was coming back down when NFP hit. I closed manually as it went through $149.39 for ZERO P/L because it was up and down like a YO-YO. Still don't know where it's going. Not much help, I'm sorry. Regards, Grahame

--- 帖子 #813 ---
i now test P4.2 and your P4.2CONTEST,but why can't get trade as yours like in the ATC2006's? should i test later? i think if i can also test like yours,the champion must have be done Go handrik,we support you!!

--- 帖子 #814 ---
There I was, sitting behind my screen and waiting for the outcome of the Nonfarm Employment Change and its effect on Phoenix in the CONTEST. I had an open SELL for the USDJPY when the price starts dropping. So trade closed in profit. And then suddenly Phoenix went LONG with 5 Lots while the price was still dropping. Ok, I thought, this is his first mistake. But to my surprise the price went up like a rocket. In only 21 seconds it made a profit of $ 1.774! Never seen this before! I made Phoenix myself but sometimes I really don't understand how it makes its decisions! Wish me luck, because tomorrow I have an interview with the organisation of the CONTEST. I'm already a little bit shaky now!

Statement Phoenix 4.2 form 25.09.2006 - 06.10.2006 on Alpari. Great Job Hendrick

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Vlaka, where's the statement?

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Hendrick, All the best for your interview tomorrow. You might ask if the word trade and position has same meaing in the Rules. I see some Participants open double 5 lot trades. The Rules state trade size max is 5 lots and max number of open positions is 3. If trade and position are synonymous, then 15 lots can be open at same time. When I first read the Rules, I interpreted that only 5 lots could be open at one time. Was it the intention for the Championships to allow 15 lots to be open at one time. At my evening meal, I will toast to you, with a good glass of wine, for a good time with tomorrow's interview. Wackena

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Here is Statement

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Thanks GF - I did that and for some reason, now the test won't even start... hmmm. Of course the desktop is still working fine. The reason I'm trying to make this laptop work is because it's got a beefy new Duo Core 2 processor that can chomp through backtests.... Any other ideas?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hendrick, Apart from the lot size restriction, you may want to talk to them about why they have allowed some of their contestants to trade on multiple currancies. When I read the rules and it said that an EA can only be attached to one chart. To me that implies only one pair to trade on. Then they accept other EA where the EA is hooked up to one chart but the writer asked for other charts to be opened at the same time and places trades on them as well. Sounds a bit unfair to me?!?! Best of luck in the comp!

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hi Wackena! Had the same idea about this as you! Only 5 lots at one time. If I knew that you could open more trades at the same time with 5 lots I could have made &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; a lot more aggressive. Well, it's too late now. Enjoy your wine (Cabernet Sauvignon?).

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Not too bad Vlaka I think!

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Please let me know if the Core 2 Duo processor really makes a difference when testing! I'm very curious about that!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt; &lt;/o &gt;

Things are looking good in the trading competition. Phoenix looked great today. Congratulations Hendrick! I wish you well in your interview. Phoenix worked great for me today. I switched to a live account quicker than planned because the test I started yesterday quit when my SBFX account stopped working for several hours. I am trading real small amounts to start because my main goal is the live server. This test has the new settings for USDJPY and EURJPY. Times on statement = GMT. Don't look at the dollar gain but at the pip gain. 192 pips closed and a positive 80 pips float. Phoenix gained 272 pips in 14 hours! With no loses running through NFP news. I'll have to see how the buy in EURUSD and USDCHF works out. Could be a bit of a challenge to keep the 100% wins ratio.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Not bad for a starter nvwine!

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hello Hendrick, here are the detailed statements for Phoenix, which is running now on two different brokers. First I started with three, but last friday I stopped the worst. In the attached zip file there are also the statements ending last friday on 26 of September, so on can see also the performance of this week. All the settings used were default and updated as you posted them. Probably the results would look better, if I started on each update with a new account. Best of luck in the contest! mamba22

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hendrick, Congrats you for your fantastic results on the competition! Wish you many more successes there and also in your real life! OK, this week I continued the test of Phoenix 4.2. The results are more favourable ones than they were a week before. I attach the statement and the preset files for your convenience. The summary: I tested three Japanese pairs only since they were told being the most profitable. I used the default settings with trailing stop. Lots: 0.1 at all trades. The EA was on during NFP hours. Closed trades: EURJPY - 5 trades - 3 * trailing [sl] and 2 * [tp] - Total + 91.80 USD GBPJPY - 2 trades - 1 * [sl] and 1 * [tp] Total -34.98 USD USDJPY -2 trades - 1 * trailing [sl] and 1 * [tp] - Total + 43.22 USD Grand Total: 98.71 USD (swap included) Floating: USDJPY -1 trades - -52.91 USD A question: Would it be possible to collect all the actual settings to the same place and keeping them there with their date of issuing? (I am not sure whther I use the latest default settings.)

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi, I will start a new thread (Phoenix 5) this weekend. In future you will find all the actual settings in post #1.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Let me combine a few things here. I don't want to fill the whole thread with my posts. I am looking forward to the new thread. Hendrick could you give me a hint as to which settings to change, in my tests, to get more trades out of Phoenix. In an early post you asked for people to test EURGBP. I can't even get it to trade over 35% of the number of trades you recommended. I can only do long optimization tests on the weekend due to processor limitations. Any hint you could give me would be appreciated. I have attached 2 zip files. The 0928-1006.zip file does not have any of the new JPY settings. The 1005-1006.zip has the new USDJPY settings for all trades and the new EURJPY settings for all but the first trade. I did not test all pairs in these tests. These tests are not as accurate as my previous test because they do not use live servers. I do not always have the best luck with demo accounts.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Thank you Hendricks, It's a very good and timely idea!

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Thanks Wackena, I haven't checked them all either, but the contest organisers made the rules and they should now stick to them. If I'm not mistaken then an EA can't (or shouldn't) place a trade on another currency pair unless it is attached to it. Therefore any EA that has these "other" charts open for reference should be disqualified, or maybe a bit softer, then any EA that places trades on another currency pair then what it is attached to should be disqualified. Just my 0.02 cents worth. Good luck!!!

--- 帖子 #840 ---
i think i have found the reason why i test not so well as hendrick and others did though we have the same P4.2 the case is the GMT Time of the MT platform. i heard that handrick use NEXTT MT4 to demo it with GMT+2 15min TimeFram ,i think it's European time ,but what i test is FXDD,it's no problem, but i think most MT4 is use GMT+3 then i find,the tow chart with the same 15M TF and different GMT time is a little different. so the trade have some asynchronous i think (in my opinion),there should be do some revise about GMT time.

sorry to my poor english hope you can understand my mean. this is my tow demoes test with P4.2 and Firebird 63G (i now test 6 demo MT in the same time ) the P4.2 setting is the default handrik give us and the FB63G setting is (30M TF 24-300-30) i hope there are some help to you thanks.

I let my demo-accounts run for 24 hours a day. So time is not an issue here. I've seen your latest statement. Is it possible that you've changed the default settings in the EA itself?

i let it go with the defualt settings you give to me. and i have to declare is, i am not open my PC over 24h,i run it on (9:00am-12:00pm GMT+8) a day maybe close my PC some time. did it effect?

Finally I've reached the last post of this BRILLIANT thread! I wanted to get involved and share my thoughts sooner but didn't want to 'cut in' before having read ALL the posts. And believe you me, it took me a while… Lacking some sleep… Not to worry though: it was more that worth it! To start off, I think a THANK YOU is in order!!! Very well done!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Since I think everybody has given so much, and one person in particular, I find it my obligation to offer my assistance to help in any way possible. Unfortunately I’m not a coder but I think we can leave that bit up to Hendrick (he's not number 2 of the world for nothing!). So I am more than willing to do forward testing from now on (in the hope my internet connection doesn’t drop out from now on.. -SIGH-). I’ve got my laptop running 24/7 anyway so I better put her to good use. Next week I will be receiving my new pc and will be able to run forward and/or backward test as per request (dual core too, so I’ll let you know if it is really better Hendrick!). Just let me know how I can help!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Just to get started on the right path: is the “Phoenix_4_CONTEST.mq4” the same as the 4.2 version that has been distributed via PM to some, please? Didn’t won’t to trouble H. via PM about it before at least introducing myself here on Forex Factory. Reason for me asking is that I have been doing quite a bit of back testing and can’t seem to get the same results as the posted statements with exactly the same settings, periods; even though I get a modelling quality of 90%... Suggestions are welcome!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Hope your interview went well Hendrick, but I’m sure it did! Looking forward to your new thread on &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; 5! At least I'll be able to follow it from the beginning this time {[Bedankt voor al het harde werk Hendrick!!!]} &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Finally; sorry for me making my first post on this forum a fairly long one, but just wanted to ventilate my appreciation properly… Vince&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; PS: guess what? This thread has just found itself another wine drinker ;-)&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

Hi Vince!, Getting different results in back testing is indeed a little bit weird. Should be the same. Only thing I can think of now is that you are using an older version of MT4. In MT4 go to Help and About. You should see there (08 Sep 2006). In one of my previous messages I've posted a short manual about back testing (ModellingQuality.pdf). Was it any help to you?&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; I'm really very interested if the Core 2 Duo will speed up testing in MT4.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; If you're willing then please try to find the right settings for the EURGBP. I've still haven't found these.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; You have to PM me one of these days about "you in the &lt;st1:country-region w:st="on"&gt;UK&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; but your heart still in &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1 lace w:st="on"&gt;Holland&lt;/st1 lace&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt;". Made me very curious!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; Take care Vince!&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;
