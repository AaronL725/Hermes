Hi all, This is a system I have been trading for a while and thought I would do as my mum taught me and share. It is a pivot point system that takes into account constricted activity around these points and helps you reach a conclusion as to trade or not. It is a high probability system so the signals do not come around all the time but when they do, you can trade fairly heavily knowing it has the best chance of success. It seems to work best on EUR/JPY but it works on other pairs as well. Here are some pics of the entries it suggests. I will post the PDF soon. http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/2650/spotfxeurjpy1 http://img111.imageshack.us/img111/4...eurjpy1ra8.png The Red bars up the top signal a sell http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/5...eurjpy2hm3.png The Green bars indicate a buy signal. Let me know what you think... GCTrader *Updated doc file on page 3, post#33*

This looks very interesting. Looking forward to your PDF!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
It has been working well and hope it keeps on working. The indicator up top looks simple but quite a bit of programming went into that. The first condition it acts on is if trading is narrow enough to be considered constrictive. This also depends on the timeframe used. Then the entry signal is given from the first stage when there is a confirmed breakout from this narrow band. The second stage compares this signal to the pivot points. If you have been studying pivot points, you know that they are a powerful tool all by themselves. The exit that I have been using is a simple reversal in the MACD histogram. It seems to work quite nicely but you can also stage out your profits at the corresponding support or resistance lines. Either way works well. The bollinger bands on the chart are there just to illustrate the narrowing of the trading range. The bollinger bandwidth is the main indicator of the narrowing. It will all be outlined in the PDF as well as the indicator code. GCTrader

Look interesting. I just went to the website IT-Finance.com I just wondering about the system that they provide. How much you pay for the system? Look forward from you. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi, Can you please post the PDF? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Here it is in word format, im sure it will raise more questions then answers especially with the code. fire away... GCTrader

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Looks very interesting, is all the indicators available with a demo account also?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
The indicators should be available with a demo account, not sure. Depends who your with I guess. IT-Finance(the charting package you see) comes packaged with my broker so I dont pay anything for that service. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Nice trade that has been signaled 7 hours ago that is still going strong! The pink bars down the bottom show a short where the entry does not coincide with the pivot point as the red bars at the top indicate. I still went in anyway, just not with as many units...glad I did!!! http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/8...eurjpy1qq3.png

I know backtesting doesnt really mean that much but here is a detailed report backtested for the previous 3 months. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/2...board01bd6.jpg

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Great looking system. Who is your broker? I'm going to see if I can download a demo. Thanks

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You can get the charts from here: www.it-finance.com but setting up all these indicators is another issue.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi there and thanks for posting. Can you confirm your broker and any minimum trades/month you have to do for the charts or if it's part of the platform. The IT-Finance site has many options, so can you offer any further info on the version and what else may be needed beyond the basics to construct the charts. I'm assuming the code is something you've done personally rather than an available option. Can you also offer backtest results beyond 3 months, say 1 or 2 years? Also, are the backtest results accurate so far as you understand? I personally don't have an aversion to paying for charts, so I'd like to understand what may be required to set up using this software rather than all the possible translation to MT code. Thanks again for posting and your time.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
this looks very interesting......any idea on how to make it work in MT4????? I do not know how to do the code at all Thanks guys!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
My broker is IGMarkets. They do a great job, no problems as of yet and you get quite alot of extras like that charting package. Although they are a market maker they are regulated since they do business in Australia(where i am) so cant do the dodgy as so many do. the charting package comes free with IG, but if you keep going with FX trading you will end up trading futures or options on futures and will have to pay for charts. I dont know about MT4 programming but I think they are fairly similar. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hench, Code error is due to RETURN TRIGGER. Delete that and it will work fine. You can copy and paste the first part of the code and that will give you the indicator without the pivot point confluence. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Even without the custom indicator, you can setup any charting package to see when to enter the trades. Which is what I did before I spent the time coding it. With the settings described in the doc. file you still can see perfectly clear when to enter. Here is a pic with entries circled. http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/679...eurjpy5er5.png

--- 帖子 #18 ---
If any live entries are signaled, I will post pics of entry live

--- 帖子 #19 ---
your system looks good but time will test its success, I will following your system and good luck to you

--- 帖子 #20 ---
What happened to the green/red bar indicator in Post #17? You remove it sometimes? For what reasons?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I have It finance charts. They are provided free with CMC markets account. apart from the great charts the good thing about cmc is that after the first mini lot you can vary the trade size by any amount you wish which is great for compounding. after the minimum 10,000k you can trade any increment even $1 so 10,001k if you like. The downside is you cant attach a profit and a stop order to pending orders like you can with metatrader, or IG markets. you can only attach one or the other with your pending order. You then have to manual add the other order after the trade is entered, which is pretty lame. Thanks for being so generous with your system and code, the generosity and selflessness of some of the people on this forum, yourself included, is remarkable. I get this error message when I paste your code into the indicator window and validate syntax error line 40, column 1 Next line expected any suggestions? I already am very experienced with pivot points so this system has instant appeal to me. I would like to give it a go. Meanwhile I'll get cracking on setting it up manually thanks again Edit: Howzat! as us Aussies would say. (I actually had that short position open on fri but closed it at + 20 pips just before your signal and an 80 pip move to S2)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
OK, it's not perfect, but at least a try. Here is a template file attached for MT4. Just add your favorite pivot indi and it should be at least a start. Enjoy...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks DX for the help. So anyone tried maybe this system?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I added the bandwidth indicator on my MACD to see when its below 0.0056. Thanks GCTrader1 for this great system. Will try this definitely starting next week. Looks promising

--- 帖子 #25 ---
DXTrade, I've tried loading this tpl file under experts and tpl for my mt4 platform and it will not load. What do you think I'm doing wrong? Thanks for your help!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
bonzdoc, The template .tpl files are in a directory on the same level as experts. In the template directory under experts are .mqt files. Hope of some help. Ola

--- 帖子 #27 ---
You got the wrong template file. Met4/templates. Dont go into the expert folder. Mart We must have hit the post button at the same time

--- 帖子 #28 ---
this looks too good to be true. Lets get this on MT4 running. Keep me posted please!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi GCTrader1, thanks for the code. Following your instructions, I've removed the "RETURN TRIGGER" code part. Now is asking me to define the following: Syntax error Define variable:b Define variable:l Define variable:a Define variable I've tried to give some values to those without success. Can you please post how you define them? Something else, in your doc you recommend "Bollinger bands with MA of 18", however in your charts BBands are 20. Thanks again for sharing your clear and concise strategy. Henry

--- 帖子 #30 ---
My template is for MT4

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Ok, I removed the bars in post#17 to illustrate that the code is not needed and you can spot the trade without it but the code makes it much easier to spot concise entries and exits. The missing variables are as follows P PIVOT DEVIATION MIN 0 MAX 40 STEP 1 L TRIGGER MIN 0.003 MAX 0.008 STEP 0.0001 B BOLLINGER BANDWIDTH MIN 17 MAX 27 STEP 1 A MACD THRESHOLD MIN 3 MAX 9 STEP 0.1 Best settings I have found are p = 14, l = 0.0056, b = 18, a = 6.2. That’s for the euroyen. These are entered in the right hand part of the indicator on IT Finance charts under variables. This enables you to adjust them without changing code and doing it live to see the results, something very valuable when I was first testing. The bollinger bands in my pics that are on the main chart are still at 20 because changing all them is a bitch and I still havent got around to it. But the are 18 in the code which gives the best entry. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #32 ---
MAC Doug, Remove RETURN TRIGGER and enter variables as in last post. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Here is the updated doc with code error removed and variables included for you to enter

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi GCTrader1, thanks again for the extra code. I could validate the strategy, but when I load it, it takes forever to optimize and the equity curve is always 0. To speed up things, I've modified the code with your already optimized variables, but the equity curve still remains 0. I might be missing something ... Henry

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Dont know there Henry, it works fine here. Just to check I copy and pasted the code from the latest doc and entered in P=14 L=0.0056 B=18 A=6.2 at the top of the code to lock in those values and it worked a charm! Check your capital management maybe??? What settings do you have there? Recommended trades over last three months, I got into 8 of them...cant be on the screens all the time! Were is that damn autotrader when you need it! http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/9...board02ql9.jpg GCTrader

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Looks like your ontop of it DXTrade! If you can convert it to MT4 format you will have a lot of happy campers! Wish I could help out there but I dont know the format for MT4. Best of luck there tho... Let me know if you need a hand with the coding and I will see what I can do! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Looks great. Hope you post the PDF soon Arnoldchidi

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi all GCT - My trading buddy, johnnyforex, is good with programming in this language and we have access to 7 years of hourly data as a subscriber to pro realtime. Just eyeballing your system over the last 4 months data shows a succes rate not unlike your backtest. Ive invited him over here so we should have some 7 year results and optimisations soon.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
MACDoug, 7 years of hourly data! Cant wait to see that... They only give 3 months of backtesting with IG.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Well the hard work is the code and you have already done that so we should have results early next week if my trading buddy comes onboard. Failing that I can do it myself when I get it to work - lol

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi GCTrader1, How successful have you found this, how many signals occur throughout the day/week? What time frame is the best? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You guys are really funny Thats my template for MT4 which I posted here in this thread on page 2. Why don't you ever read a thread from the beginning? Come on... it's only 3 pages for now.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
My two cents here..... H1 data without underlying M1 data COULD give false backtests.... simply because MT4 will drop down to the lowest timeframe for entries and exits..... When you only have H1 data, the backtester won't know where to put the exit (because the movement during the hour isn't available) Because this system enters at the end of an hour (correct GCT?) then you might be alright.... Just need GCT to verify entries and exits by eyeballing them. GCT, This system is extremely systematic. That can work either way. I like the results so far, but am still going to remain skeptical for awhile until I can get my own hands dirty with it. The one thing that bothers me is your use of wide stops during initial entry. Your Risk:Reward could actually be less than 1:1, which is a red flag in my book. Sorry if I sound negative, it's just that forex is a tough market to make money in consistently, and I reserve my judgements until I feel confident in them. Thanks for sharing this..... very good combination of PP and BB.... never seen anything quite like it, and its got a professional look. -TD

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks for the template! I have never added a template to my chart before...can you explain to me how to add templates to MT4? Thank you in advance! Edit: NEVERMIND...I found it!! Looks GREAT!!! Hope it works!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
This system is very systematic and thats the way I like it. It is not unusual for 2 different people to have the same system when one trader is profitably trading and the other is not. This is due to the psychology of trading which in my opinion is the biggest downfall of many traders. I wait for the entry candle to close before i enter as retracements can give a false early entry. It has been profitable for me so far and that is trading live. Im sure some more tweaking of the system would help, but I like the old saying, "If something ain't broke, dont fix it!" GCTrader

--- 帖子 #46 ---
The system is great ...the settings have to be changed for each currency pairs.. I being using BB squeeze indicators for some days now and combined with above system..it would give much accurate signal where the potential breakout could be.. Try these indicators and see if we can work out work on this...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The Bandwidth cannot work at a constant value (.0056 or whatever). It is designed to use relative values as a trigger point. For example, if you look back on a chart, the indicator spent most of it's time well below .0056, during July. Bollinger recommends using the 6 month extremes as triggers. This means that the Bandwidth indicator doesn't signal a squeeze until it falls below the 6 month low reading. He was talking about daily charts. Six months of daily bars is equal to about 132 bars. If you translate that to hourly candles, it equals about 5.5 days. I would place a line at the 5 or 6 day low and wait for the indicator to fall below that level before I looked for a trade.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Wow you have taken a very simple indicator in pivot points and made it very complicated. Trading pivot points are actually easy. The price breaks thru the pivot point or not. If in an uptrend the price breaks thru the pivot point then the close of candlestick will confirm the break. So simply buy on the opening of the next candle. If in an uptrend the price doesnt break thru the pivot point then the candle will not close above the pivot point but below it. And that is your signal to go short.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Have to look into that, sounds good! So you have read Bollinger on bollinger I take it? Im going to have to buy that one, heard good things about it. One book I recommend is Forex Conquered, amazing book! Person goes quite in depth about pivot points and like I said in earlier posts they can be a trading strategy all by themselves, im all for a system that dilutes the entry points down to the ones with the best opportunity for success. GCTrader

Any updates on this? Ill post results after my test is complete.

I had the same on this pair as well as the GJ...I doubled my lots and took 20 pips each. Trades triggered after I went to bed...it was nice to see 40 pips sitting in the bank when I woke up!! Great system! I'll used this along with the BAT!!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hi, for the gj, what triggered line u use?? what is BAT?? thanks lin

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I placed a buy and a sell stop 9 pips above the closest resistance line and 9 pips below the closest support line. While I slept they triggered. I used a 50 pip fixed stop for both. It triggered at 223.04 Here's a link to the BAT system!! Very powerful tool!! Happy piping! http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=12808

Yes there was a trade yesterday but I missed it, have to find a way to auto trade this. but that can be dangerous as well, its just this system has been so good I would at least like to give it a go on autotrade... Here is the chart for the last couple of days, as you can see yet another great trade! http://img258.imageshack.us/img258/1...eurjpy6aa5.png Red bars represent a short where the squeeze co-insides with a break of the pivot points where the pink bars represent a short where it does not...

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi GCTrader1 How can I get the charts you have got, with the code on the chart? Is there a free charting tool, company that will provide this? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #57 ---
On the far left of your screenshot there are red bars but the candles seem to be moving slightly up. We can't see the entire price action. Was that a winning or losing trade? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
That was the end to a very nice trade. I wait till it is obvious that the move is over which sometimes means giving a little back but its much better than missing out on a big move because I was jittery! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Guess, It is free with my Broker(see previous posts). good package that works well for me... GCTrader

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks for sharing this method GCT. I currently use Dollies System (check it out if you haven't) but became enamored with your bollinger band squeeze and now are using as my first sign that a trade is coming. I will post a chart soon showing how I use this with Dollie.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Attached is a trade using the b.bands squeeze as a primary indicator that the price was going to jump. I scalp and this squeeze is proving effective on the small timeframes. I also trust Guppy and you will see that on the chart. I also use Dollie's original Setup. If you are interested in her method please check out her thread. Thanks again GT for sharing your method. I will continue to use the squeeze as a way of setting up trades. Jake

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Attached is a trade I just got out of for 9 pips using the Squeeze to tell me that a move was coming.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
It can be used on smaller time frames, in particular the 10min. That is how i started this system. I entered when it was considered constricted and set a stop loss of 20 pips and a take profit of 20 pips. It nearly always hit my TP within the hour if not less. So for the scalper, this can set up some nice entries as well! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Thanks alot for the info on the Guppy, goooood stuff! So is that the GMMA indicator in the middle of the other bands? Did you have to purchase them? And if not where are they available? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
here you go... also, there is a ton of info on guppy... just google it.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
This should be fun. How long have you been using them?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
DEAR ..... JCBLCS 79 THANK YOU FOR YOUR GRET WORK ... CAN YOU SEND YOUR TEMPLATE ...... THANKS AGAIN

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I love when I wake up and a trade is brewing. I usually am late on these great moves. See attached chart for details. Ziko, I use Dollies System as my primary indicator. Please read through her thread to get all of those details http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=28935 . Other then that I am using the b.bands squeeze as explained by GTC on this thread. I am also strong believer in the Guppy Fast and Slow Moving Averages. This gives me a great feel for the market. If you backtest the GMMA with the Squeeze you'll be amazed by the amount of pips that can be made during these times. They don't happen often but if you are patient I believe this in itself can be an extremely profitable method... just look at the chart below as a current example. The Gbp/Yen did the same move but I didn't get in on that.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Very nice system, I will give it a try. Thanks for sharing. AL

Whoever is better programmer than I am can process the "semiproduct" mq4 which I have enclosed here from post 33 into an indicator or even EA?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
GCT Nice strategy. I am in the middle of writing it up in Easy Language. How is the Trigger level calculated? I see that you use 0.0056 for EURJPY would it be different for other pairs?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
hi, Colostarr, , cant send pm to you due to my post count, do u hav ym, i hav something to ask u about the bat, thanks, it is not good to discuss here.....

--- 帖子 #73 ---
At the moment, that level is set manually for each different pair. This is temporary as I am trying to work at the math behind getting that calculated automatically. Nice trade in the aussie atm! http://img252.imageshack.us/img252/8...xaudusduc1.png

--- 帖子 #74 ---
this was one of your high probability entries on a break of the central pivot. using the macd to exit you would have bagged 100 pips - fantastic!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I'm using bollinger bands, patterns and SR's ..I just clubbed the strategy. At the moment 7.30 PM EST...EURUSD is showing very high squeeze..may be a breakout is in the way..cannot see any patterns...but volatility is squeezed...don't know which direction it will go...any ideas?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Looks like the direction is south in EURUSD, USDCAD has similier squeeze..it could shoot up

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Does anyone have any good suggestions on how to handle/avoid fake BB breakouts? For example when price appears to break lower from a tight channel but then suddenly reverses and then goes up?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I dont have a squeeze or even close, we must be using different formula on the BB's

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I was wondering the same thing. A breakout after a squeeze is extremely reliable but the inital move doesent always indicate where price will end up when the breakout is done. It usually does either one of two things 1. continue moving in the direction of the initial move 2. retrace the original move and then move the same distance or more in the opposite direction To handle a false breakout If you place a stop and reverse order, instead of just a stop on the first trade. it looks like you would almost always at least recover your losses on the losing trades. Sooner or later a scenario will occur where both trades lose but that looks like a very rare occurence To avoid a false breakout I think the best alternative though is to take only the high probability signals in the indicated direction as CGT's system advocates. Trade less but win more trades with less stress and a smooth equity curve. As usual, patience and discipline go with success in trading

--- 帖子 #80 ---
yesterday my chart didnt hav any trade also, the triggered line not cut yet, so will it have a different setting??

--- 帖子 #81 ---
No there was no signal yesterday, using the eur/usd is possible using this system but its a grind. This doesnt give too many signals so using yen crosses maximizes profits. http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/9...xeurusdhq0.png

sori if this question had been ask.... instead of ej, what others currencies suit to this strategy?? i think eu is hard to have a valid signal..

This looks great...How do I put it on my chart...did you buy it? Thanks Sir, Arnoldchidi

--- 帖子 #86 ---
[quote=GCTrader1;1736494] I entered short below the central pivot at 162.49 I am trailing the move down . the hourly wasnt quite ripe so I moved down to the 30 min chart and took the signal from that time frame. I use heiken ashi candles to trail my stop and that usually gets me most of the move but Looks like I may be giving quite a bit back on this one. We will see p.s I loved the rainbow I made with the bollingers but it got in the way of price action and is unnecessary so I had to take it off. I still use it as a quick visual reference but when it comes down to trading I like naked price action.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
The bands werent nearly constricted enough, its still needed to trade around the pivot point for longer to narrow the bands and make the breakout more convincing... Remember, if your changing timeframes from your usual setup, its because your looking for what you want to see rather than what the charts are really showing. GCTrader http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/2...xeurjpyzi4.png

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Try changing the bands period..some would say...i have changed to suit myself...hehehe...and the market does not care...but changing the period sometimes works..but it has to be checked for longer time say one week to make it worthwhile..

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I am not an expert on Bollinger bands but I understand their use for this strategy so I will answer your question as best I can how to put them on your chart Very easy. Add bollinger bands to your chart from your indicators. You should be able to change the parameters for colour and moving average period. Keep adding new bollingers with different colours and increasing the moving average as suggested in the pdf file provided for this strategy early in this thread How they work When price trades in a narrow range, It builds energy for the next move. The longer price remains constricted, the more energy it builds and so the bigger the breakout move is expected. Bollinger bands constract during the consolidation and reveal a trading opportunity is approaching. That is the squeeze and is very useful in determining good times to trade. The hard part is then timing the breakout and picking the direction. CGT has provided a technique whereby when the strategy conditions are met, is very accurate in providing an early entry in the correct direction, complete with two exit strategies. Brilliant!

GtcTRADER1 , if i wish to trade other pair using this method , are there any possibility?? if have, what input on bbandwidth will suitable, thanks

Hello nklin, I may trade GJ with minor change on banwidth indicator to trigger at 0.85, may be with filtering further using increasing macd bar at least 3 bar at initial crossing.(or u may add some filter indicator of your choice-but I think this system is nearly complete) MAC Doug- what your suggestion?Just to make sure that the initial move after band constriction is a pure trend and not just minor retracement. To GCT Trader 1-I love your squeeze indi at the bottom of your previous chart.Nway-keep goin w this marvellous system(and nice lookin) I'm super newbie-give me direction.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
..ops...trigger level at bandwith 0.85 is to sensitive,reset to 0.56 Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Nice MACDoug, seems like you know what your talking about. But with the settings for the bollinger bands, as you add more bollinger bands you add 0.2 to the deviation not the sample period. I will have to get back to you about the best settings for the cableyen, that pair is insane so hope you dont have a weak heart! No trades surfacing yet but will keep you posted. 2 of my screens are down and that is soooo anoying so trying to rectify that atm! Talk soon, GCTrader

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Possible breakout signalling soon as you can see from the bollinger bandwidth dropping to 0.0037. Hope to see some nice action... http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/7...eurjpy7wv4.png ;No signal yet tho....

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Dat, Im not sure about MT4, i havent used that platform before so cant help there. With the indicator, change the type of chart to histogram and that should convert it. Best of luck. Let me know if you get MT4 working, I think that some indicators were posted earlier in this thread for that. GCTrader

I have made up both. One without the pivot point confluence to keep me open to normal breakouts and my bcktest which also signals me to enter and exit which I trade heavily with since it is right more times than not. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Down the bottom of the graph shows pink bars which are a sell signal without the pivot point confluence. I was only in this trade for a very short time as I wait for my system to give me a buy or sell but they are still good for 30 pips normally which I made 32 pips last night in that trade.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
You have provided us with both, back test code and live code?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
GCT, when I copy your code (from the second pdf) in the backtest ( cmc - same chart package as IG) and enter the optimizing values and click 'validate' I just get an optimizing box saying 0% which doesn't move. What I am doing wrong? The only things that are giving me trouble: in the variables box I have to set 'no restriction' rather than the default '&gt;0' on the pivot variable as there is a 0 in there; and for some reason my bollnger bandwidth line keeps resetting to 0.006 when I type in 0.0056. The only thing else on the charts that is dissimilar (apart from no pink squeeze indicator, which would be great) is that when I put 5, 13, 1 into my MACD settings everything disappears in my MACD window except the blue line. Can you, or anyone else, help with enablement? I suspect I may not be the only person with this issue. Cheers.

Here is the code for the indicator, not backtest and without pivot point confluence. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- trigger = undefined rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then trigger = 0 endif rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =-1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then trigger = 0 endif return trigger ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- L is the trigger level B is the bollinger bandwidth A is the MACD threshold

--- 帖子 #110 ---
It stays at 0% because there is way to much to optimize, you have to experiment yourself. Use the code in the previous post for the pink bars, just change the indicator to histogram. With the MACD, change the signal part of the indicator to a histogram also. When it says it is 0.006 in the trigger level dont believe it, I get the same thing but it is infact 0.0056. Let me know if you need more clarification. GCTrader

Hi GCTrader1, First of all, I would like to thank you for providing us with the code, you are a kind man and this system is great! What are the values for L, B and A? Thanks Guess

--- 帖子 #114 ---
GCTrader, cheers for that. Two problems down, one and a half to go. I created an indicator with the code you have just posted. I wrote the three values A = 6.2 and B = 18 and L = 0.0056 firstly above the code, and then in the alternative I tried adding them in the indicator perameter box (float, as integer won't allow decimal places). In both cases it did create an indicator (hallelujah!!!) but nary a pink bar (short) nor a blue bar (long) stirred on the new Squeeze indicator on my chart. I would have guessed that this means there hasn't been a trade today but I applied the new indicator across a number of charts and there is nothing on any of them. Without wanting to get ahead of myself here, assuming this indicator can be made to work so that those lovely pink and blue bars do eventually pop up, is there any possibility after that point of adding into the indicator the requisite code to take account of your pivot filter? Thanks a lot for the help so far. Your time is really appreciated.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thanks Ironball, Got it worlking!!!!! I see the trades that GCTrader has taken!!! They are the same as he has pointed out... I have to say GCTrader is legend!!! Ahh I know your problem, you need to change the colors for up trend and down trend when applying the indicator to the chart. Hope it helps! Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Guess, I wish it were that simple! I just tried changing the colours (they should have been showing up anyway) and that didn't work. What exactly did you do, step by step, to get the indicator working? Is there something else on my chart outside the squeeze indicator, that needs to be there for the squeeze indicator bars to work?

Hi GCTrader1, What other pairs will this work on? Or do you need to change settings on anything? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I had already changed the style to histogram. Nuts!! So you just clicked create indicator and dragged across the code from a few posts above, and then typed in those three values above the code. And you got pink bars appearing? What the **** am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Ok im going to do this storybook style... Firstly, here is the code as shown in my program. http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/8...board03eq6.jpg Here are the variables shown in my program exactly as they should be entered. http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/222/clipboard04yh1.jpg http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/3...board05zt3.jpg http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6...board06ow2.jpg This system of course can be used on different pairs but the settings will have to change depending most largely on volatility. I stick to euroyen as this works very well and have no need to look elsewhere. If you find the need to be trading all the time, then find a scalping system as this system is high probability and consequently a few trade a week system. Rest assured tho that those trades have the highest chance for success which in my mind is better than the need to feed my ever dwindling need to always be in the market. If you have any more questions or if my storybook style didnt help, let me know and i will do my best. Glad I can help some of us educated traders have an alternate source of income other than trading time for money... GCTrader

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Yep, Created the indie again, create the indie, put in the values that you have said and changed the colors and to histogram and job done! Not too sure why it ain't working for you.

The values you have advised me do not work for me. I placed them and the bars disappeared, I had to use the the other settings Ironball mentioned and they worked for me. Do you have another code, the pivot confluence indicator, or is this your primary indicator to make your call? I had to place the settings that

--- 帖子 #124 ---
IT-Finance is the charting company used by IGMarkets and a few others I believe. I use IGMarkets for FX trading so use their charts. They seemed good enough and I just ran with it and developed my own code for indicators and backtesting. If you do eventually end up with ITFinance charting package then this code will work straight out of the doc file. If you use another charting package, then some work will be needed to convert it. It has already been done(although without the entry and exits highlighted) in the 2nd page of this thread for MT4 format. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The settings you have here are different: 0.0062 20 6.2 From the chart below, why is that?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Guess, Once those values have been entered in the program, you can change those values to suit what pair you are trading just by hitting the spanner icon in the indicator bar. I have posted the optimized settings for euroyen earlier in this thread but if you find better ones, please post! The code for the pivot point confluence can be found on the 3rd page of this thread in the attached doc... Let me know if it doesnt work but I did try it out from scratch by copy and paste from that doc and entering in the variable code as well. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Those values, while they are set as arbitrary numbers now, will have to be derived somehow from the graph itself. I am currently trying to work that out and until then, the numbers will slightly move. i.e I trim them so that they are still considered to be within my systems underlying strategy. As soon as I can work out that problem(which is pretty huge) than those numbers will have to "float" within a narrow channel. That is why I have them as user definable in the charting package. Maybe you can help there???

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Here is the code as shown in my charting package which takes the output from the squeeze indicator and compares it with pivot points... http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/537...board07ql2.jpg

--- 帖子 #129 ---
GCTrader, thank you very much! I followed your storybook to the letter. In particular, changing the L value to 0.014 is what has enabled me to see the pink and blue bars. I couldn't see them before when I was using 0.0053 or (what you are using) 0.0062. However, the pink and blue bars when using the value 0.014 are perpetual, ie there is never a time when there is not a trade signal, either short or long. Once I get this up and running, with the right value, non-constant signals and with pivot filter, I will buy you one big e-drink!!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
lol, cheers mate, as we apparently say down here. Thats because at that trigger level, nearly everything is considered an entry at 0.014. Think of it as constable kodak putting his camera level at 10km/h in a 50 zone, he is going to be sending out a lot of nasty fines. Same thing here, aim for the speeders(ie, get that trigger level down to a level which is constricted, high buildup...big moves)!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Right. http://www.clipartof.com/images/xsmall/198.gif But when constable kodak changes on my chart from 0.014 to 0.013 everyone still gets a ticket, but at 0.012 on my chart, let alone 0.0062, no one gets issued anything at all, as the speeders as well as the little old ladies all vanish!

Just reading through this thread and am finding it quite interesting. I don't think that one can go too far wrong using Bollinger as a mentor when it comes to trading Forex. This market loves to go from compression to expansion which is suppossedly what Bollinger traders try to take advantage of. GCTrader1 seems to have done so very nicely and has been most generous in sharing. I realize that an MT4 version has been posted a few pages back but since there are a lot of MT4 users (myself being one of them) I thought that I would amuse myself and see if I could add to this method. My coding skills are not the greatest so I decided to try and use some of the already existing Bollinger related indicators. See attached charts. The magenta dots on the bbsqeeze seem to line up with the green and magenta dots on the bbhisto. I suppose that whether or not this proves to be a workable setup remains to be seen (proven) in forward testing. I will add the indicators and template in the next few posts incase anyone is interested in playing around with this. I am curious to see if this setup will actually mimic GCTrader1's setup. Although I have not done an exhaustive comparison, at first glance it seems to corellate rather well. There seem to be a few occasions where it gives a slightly earlier signal - for whatever thats worth.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Here are the indicators. I am not sure just how DPO functions or if it is even a Bollinger based indicator, perhaps someone with more knowledge than I would be willing to expound on its use. It seems to corroborate the signal when it crosses the bbsqeeze waterline so I thought it might be usefull.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Like I have said, dont really know the settings for other pairs as it works soooo well on the euroyen. that was a guess. AUDJPY is more volatile so the trigger level has to be higher. Another great trade 2 days in a row. Took profit at the S1 line + some just in case it bounces before it. In at 16187.5 out at 16130, nice little trade.

Just trying to analyse the last trade from a hindsite perspective. I have stacked the indicators a little differently than in my last post in order to get a bit better clarity. Bbhisto is now in a window of its own. Bbsqueeze started to show a squeeze (magenta dots) so that would be a heads up for an impending trade. Bbhisto initially printed green dots leading one to think that the play may be in the upwards direction, however, neither the Macd histo nor the bbsqueeze or the DPO crossed their respective waterline so a long play was never triggered. Bbhisto then printed a red dot with the Macd histo, bbsqueeze histo and DPO in corroboration. A short play could have been initiated at the highlighted bar. ( ahh...isn't hindsight wonderfull ). Not quite as "clean" a signal as GCT's setup, requiring a bit of discretion by the trader, but it did come a little earlier and could have given a few extra pips. I am not entirely satisfied that this chart setup is as mechanical as GCT's and will consider it to be just a starting point at this time. I would like to see a few more trades unfold before deciding if there is something useful here. Perhaps its just as easy to open a new account with IT Finance as it is to mess around trying to get MT4 to mimic the setup. Any suggestions are welcome.

--- 帖子 #150 ---

O.K. let's have a look at the last trade. Bbsqueeze prints magenta dot at the waterline giving a heads up to an impending trade (a bollinger band sqeeze is forming). Bbhisto prints red dots indicating a possible short however, there is no cross of the waterline by the DPO so no short entry ( oh boy, there is that hindsite again ). Bbhisto then prints a green dot with Macd histo and DPO (rising) confirming. Bandwidth also rising towards .0056 level. Either of the two bars marked with vertical blue line could have been an entry. Once again, not a completely mechanical signal, some discretion is still required by the trader. A some what later signal could have been taken when the Bandwidth crossed the .0056 threshold - a safer entry but less pips ??? To answer Colostarr's question: Yes the setup is for MT4. The attached template should help with your setup. The indicators are available from post 141. DPO was initially just drag and dropped from the indicators list ontop of bbsqueeze, the rest of the indicators were just attached to the chart as per usual. The magenta dots that appear on the bbsqueeze are your heads up that a bollinger band squeeze is occuring and it may be time to watch for a trade. All of the other indicators must line up - DPO must cross waterline, bbhisto must print appropriate coloured dot, Macd signal must corroborate and Bandwidth must be rising and be ready to or already crossing the .0056 level. When all the ducks are in a row that is theoretically when one pulls the trigger. Please be aware that this is currently just a test set up for MT4 in an attempt to mimic GCT'S entries. Needs some practice as it is not quite as mechanical as GCT's method on the IT Finance platform. Practice before you play!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
If you already have a broker, than I wouldnt worry about changing them just to have ITfinance charts, even tho they are good. If you dont have one, then IGMarkets are your best bet. If your new, start with $500 rather than a demo and deal with 1 mini unit. This way you introduce yourself to the psychological side of trading. Demo trading is a waste of time for any longer than 3 months. After losing money for 6 months(you will!) a light bulb will turn on in your head and than everything makes sense and trades are nothing but opportunities to make money(which you can now do regularly).

FXHermit, As always, looks like your ontop of it! Glad you have some MT4 skills for all the people out there with meta. While my chart looks great with a signal blatently obvious in the form of red of green bars, this is not needed. Watching those bands narrow far narrower than what has been traded lately is a precursor to a possible large move. MACD threshold turnaround is just one way to exit, pivot points are the other highly effective way to do that. bollinger bandwidth in histogram points out the compression of the bands really well so that is how I started thinking along the lines of a trigger level. The code I am working on now will not have a set trigger level, more an intuitive level that changes depending on current market data. This new trigger will be superimposed ontop of the bollinger bandwidth so you can keep an eye on the level. Anyway, I hope this system is helping out all you traders out there as it is working VERY well for me and that is why I thought to share... GCTrader

When I first started using it, it gave a signal almost everyday. BILLBSS once told me that the BAT method doesn't work well in a ranging market...boy was he right! I keep watching it, even though my last 3 orders in a row stopped out (2 buy signals and a sell signal), and I only look to gain 20 pips per trade. Today sell signal (if it hits) doesn't look good, unless it corresponds with a negative news release for GBP or positive release for USD. I am definitely not as aggressive with it as I once was!! It'll come back..the markets always go back to the trend eventually! If you have questions about it..please do let me know! As for now, I am having fun with the squeeze method!! Me like!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Currently active bar starting to signal squeeze. Just noticing this as I am about to go out so will not be able to follow this into a possible trade signal, will have to look at it later in hindsite.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Correct, It has narrowed up again and we are getting a possible entry, will post when this is so. It is down to a 0.0044, just a matter of time now. GCTrader http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/3...xeurjpyhi0.png

System has given a green light for a long. In at 16464.1 with half unit as it is nowhere near a pivot point which doesnt make it as effective a signal. With the tankan out on friday and bad news expected im still optimistic and going with the fundamental trade. Still be nice if it bounced off the pivot point. 1st TP is at 16500 GCTrader http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/9...xeurjpytn2.png

Finally adjusted my main bollinger bands to keep it all in line. BB sample period is 18. Here is the updated chart. http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/3...xeurjpywt3.png

Awesome....I have been fiddling with the MT4 chart created by fxhermit...and it gave me the identical signal! I wanted to double check it, and low and behold here is your post! I'm in at 164.71. Thank you for the chart FXhermit and thank you for this system GCtrader!!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
No worries Colostarr, You probably want to write in code somehow like mine, that gives an entry signal which coincides with the pivot point. As you can see from the charts above, there is no green buy bars up the top which means it is not a strong buy. If it was breaking out above a pivot point, then that is pure gold! This trade is part of my system but still provides plenty of good entries. Lets see what the market holds for us! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Sorry sir but you are talking with someone that has trouble figuring out how to install a bandwidth ind. Writing code is something I am no good at. I do understand the principles of your system though. I have price no where near any pivot point right now. It was my first attempt at a trade. Volatility seems really low right now with EJ...however with GJ I managed to nab 35 pips! Waiting now for Tp 165.00 on ej!! Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
3 hours in...closed trade +20 pips. Moving too sideways for my liking! You are right about the pivot points GCtrader...I will definitely keep that in mind for the next wave!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Trade is going our way as planned, very good to hear you pulled some pips there colostarr! Big numbers like 165 can be a hard nut to crack. It went close and I got out, live to fight another day. On such a borderline entry signal, im out on the first pivot point. When it coincides with a big number, I put it slightly on the down side or like colostarr, if its having some serious resistance to the trade then exit close to the planned exit. Here is an alternate code for those having trouble with the first code. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then buy 1shares at market realtime endif if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then sell 1 shares at market endif if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then sellshort 1 shares at market realtime elsif abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then exitshort 1 shares at market realtime endif The variables are as follows L TRIGGER MIN 0.003 MAX 0.008 STEP 0.0001 B BOLLINGER BANDWIDTH MIN 17 MAX 27 STEP 1 A MACD THRESHOLD MIN 3 MAX 9 STEP 0.1 Hope it works well for you! This one does not include pivot point confluence for the really high probability trades. Get this going first, then there is hope. lol GCTrader http://www.forexfactory.com/dealing/.../img/trans.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/dealing/.../img/trans.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/dealing/.../img/trans.gif

Well what an interesting night. The trade went according to plan but stopped 2 pips from the TP. I took it at 16495.5. Went well, but as soon as it had reached the R1 line it reversed and headed down strongly. Hope eveyone got some pips out of that move! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Cheers for that GCT. I've signed up for a trial with Prorealtime. The grinding-to-a-halt issue I am having at the moment is that my IG charts go into sleep mode after a couple of hours, which makes receiving alerts during the night impossible. Do you (or does anyone else) know of a way to solve this problem? I am hoping that the Prorealtime charts can stay data-alive for several hours at least. GCT, you must have this problem yourself if you are trading off the probacktest bar signals transmitted to your phone, unless you are that fast of a rockclimber!!!? It's my birthday today (really - getting old..) - and if anyone can solve this problem for me it will be a pretty, pretty (said in Larry David style) good present. Cheers! IB

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Ironball Happy Birthday! Which trial did you choose and were you able to get the charts set up correctly? thanks Rob

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Cheers Longboat! I signed up for the free charts and have emailed them to ask for the full 7 day trial. Have got the chart up with probacktest but until they contact me to confirm the full trial the chart doesn't yet have data on a sufficiently low timeframe.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
fxhermit, I like your indicators on the chart (#194) Can you post your BB MACD and the Bandswidth(18,2) indicators? Thanks

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Happy B'day Ironball... Have you got your charting working on the IG software... as I am still having trouble.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I managed to get access to IG charts. Is there any way to transfer the code to the probacktester without typing it in? It won't let me copy and paste. Thanks

--- 帖子 #210 ---
hi billbss He has the code on the attached doc on the first page, it's in word format. regards, guess

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Right. I have the code. I'm saying I can't copy and paste it into the probacktest. I have to type it all in.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Bilbss, try dragging rather than copy and pasting. Cheers Guess! I somehow got the charting working on IG, although for some reason despite the same settings the probacktest trades always (mostly) end a bar later than the corresponding Squeeze trades, which is a pain as the alert is probacktest and the optimal exit looks to be Squeeze. GCT, any idea why this is and how to rectify it? I still haven't got the code working at all on cmc .

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I wouldn't know how to drag it. The chart is an interactive java chart on my web browser. Where would I drag from?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi billbss, You should be able to cut and paste from the doc to the indicator/back tester. It worked for me. Regards, Guess

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I found that you can drag from the word doc straight into the 'create probacktest' box. Just highlight the text, then click and hold your mouse on it and move the cursor across into the probacktest box.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Firefox wouldn't let me paste into it. When I right click my mouse, there was no "paste" available. I also have IE. Let me try that. Thanks

Control and c (copy and paste).

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Here you go. Have fun. P.S. They are not originally my indicators - others have been kind enough to create them -I am just trying to adapt them to this methodology to the best of my limited abilities.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I like your thinking and approach. As you are aware, I am bit by bit trying to replicate your approach for the MT4 platform, so far it is still a work in progress. I am at the same time trying to increase my very limited knowledge of MT4 coding hoping at some point to be knowlegeable enough to code from scratch - that may take a while! I have just pulled my copy of "Bollinger on Bollinger Bands" off the shelf and am going to give it a re-read, who knows, might gain an extra insight or two. Thanks for the great thread and your willingness to share.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
fxhermit, Thank you very much for the 2 Indicators

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Why do the most profitable trades fall on when Im asleep!!! And this had pivot point confluence so the top bars were initiated! Damn it, I go in big when those babies are up for a run! http://img104.imageshack.us/img104/1...xeurjpyye4.png What can you do! There is a solution to the timeout problem or inactivity timeout for these charts, a mouse randomizer. Just turn it on when your asleep or whatever and it will keep that chart pumping! Just turn it off when ur on the computer as it is annoying as hell! Here is the download link for your convenience! http://www.mininova.org/tor/203377 Billbss - CTL C then CTL V IronBall - Not sure why it is ending early, are the MACD threshold settings the same? GCTrader

--- 帖子 #222 ---
lol! You need a EA for this system! I cannot seem to find out how to demo the software you are using. Was anyone successful downloading the charts software etc?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I went short on a break of the central pivot for last nights squeeze trade and could not believe my eyes when I woke up. I closed the position at at 1.6210 for an even 200 pips. Did your pivot point indicator give this signal? edit: sorry you posted the answer while I was writing my post p.s good work going with pro realtime. Now we will be able to get bandwidth numbers for all pairs from an optimised 10 year backtest. I wanted to do it but I cant get your code to do anything and Im such a computer veg head I have no hope of fixing myself

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I don't think the bandwidth indicator lends itself to optimization. The way it's calculated, it is relative to price. Right now the .0056 works pretty well, but I think that is coincidental. If you look back on a chart, bandwidth stayed below .0056 the first 6 months of the year. John Bollinger says to look for extremes, not any set number. He was talking about daily charts, but he said to consider a squeeze as being a six month low in Bandwidth. That translates to 132 daily bars. If you apply that to 1H bars, it is about 5.5 days. That would mean that a squeeze is on when bandwidth is below the 5.5 day low. That doesn't mean 5.5 days between trades. You can have a 5.5 day low every day.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi, I am having issues with coding, has anyone successfully coded this?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
thanks for repeating this. sorry for not paying attention earlier. You are saying we would be better to use the 132 bar low as the breakout number. That is probably optimisable in itself and an indicator could be made to show the ideal low to work with every bar

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi GCTrader, I have figured it out at last... well sort of! Might need your help here. I have created the indicator, brilliant! Not a problem. Though I have created the back testing as you described in your document. Though I see you have changed your back testing indicator that does a call TRIGGER = SQUEEZE[X,Y,Z] This is where I have the issue and get the error as stated in my post, though if I add the code as in your doco, I get the back testing. If you can help me fix this, then no probs, otherwise I'll leave it as it is and see how I get along. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Billbss As above, I have stated that a solution is needed about the trigger level. the trigger level that I have used is just a stop gap until I can find out how to derive it from the chart. With more people helping now Im sure we can come up with a solution... GCTrader

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I got lucky on this one. I also apply this method to the GJ chart. I had a sell stop in place from another method I use (8h GJ). I was lucky enough to grab 100 pips while I slept. Yesterday was a good day! Anyway...what exactly do you mean by "Pivot point Confluence"? Is it that price was riding a pivot point, even though there was no squeeze, your system told you to initiate a sell order? Can you explain that further? The charts I show only limit us to a certain signal. The BBsqueeze waterline was teal, not magenta, so I would have stayed away anyway. If I know what else to look for, it would make this system even more manageable!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
There was a squeeze, the bollinger bandwidth went from 0.0042 to 0.0044 while at the pivot point signaling a trade. A very nice one at that!!! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I will take a look at it. I guess I am just being a bit tunnel visioned. I have trained my eye to look for the "squeeze" in the bands first, then to the indicators. Learn, Learn, Learn. Thank you sir!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Ok, here is the chart showing a closeup of the trade. http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/304...xeurjpydi7.png As you can see it was restricted, but nowhere near a pivot point. It was still under the trigger level which means the system was waiting for it to breakaway from a pivot point. It finally reached it and while still being under the trigger level, entered a short trade when the bollinger bandwidth increased from 0.0042 to 0.0044. This showed an increase of volatility in the continued direction south. Its ALL a learning curve, it never ends! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #233 ---
FXHermit, I applied these indicators to another chart, but they look completely foreign. Any help as to applying them to this method??

--- 帖子 #234 ---
MACDoug has referred me to this system and I'll jump on board and take a look as soon as I get the chance. For those wondering about backtesting on a 1H timeframe, I alwys programme in code which logicaly predicts what the price action was within the hour. Where its a green candle my backtests always asusme price went up to the high wick before going down to the low wick then closing at the close. In the case of a red candle, my backtests asusme price goes down to the lower wick first, then go up to the high wick and then close at the close. It is of course not 100% correct - but I would suggest at least 75% correct and this way I allow myself the luxury of backtesting all my systeme development over a 7 year period when testing on a 1hour chart. Even if the above logic is 25% wrong, its really swings and roundabouts - so it is likely to be wrong as many times as it is right. Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Alright, I think I follow you. When you speak of the "trigger level" you are referring to the bandwitdh level of .0056 correct? So even though the BBands aren't squeezing, the bandwidth is below the trigger (.0056). Ok, so when price reached the pivot point, and the bandwidth is at .0044 (I just assume anything below .0056 is constricted...correct?) This is where price made the breakout that it did. So amongst other things, something to watch for would be low volatility in the bandwidth. If price is hanging around a pivot, then stand by for pending explosion! If price works it's way down to a pivot point while bandwidth remains below .0056...again standby for pending explosion! Is this correct? I know there must be many more variable trades...but this seems to me a common thing with this method??

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Colostar: Bear with me for a bit, I am just in the process of re-reading "Bollinger on Bollinger Bands". Have had a couple of aha moments and am applying them to the charts. I have a busy week ahead so may not have anything concrete till next week. At that time I will upload an updated MT4 version and explain in detail the attachment and properties setup for the indicators. I would like to see a few real time signals evolve before I post the template, etc. I am striving to use GCT's principals combined with the MT4 platform to give us an "all ducks in a row" entry signal without having less reliability than GCT's signals. (maybe even better - now wouldn't that be nice ). Anyway, that's the goal -hope it is achievable....

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Haha, In the blue corner - MT4, red corner - ITFinance..... FIGHT! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, I hear what you are saying - the ideal trigger level indicator would certainly be a dynamic trigger based on price action. In bollinger speak - we are looking for the beginning of the expansion ( increased volatility ) preferably early enough to get as close to an ideal entry as possible while filtering out the false and weaker moves. I have some indicators for MT4 that are bollinger based in various ways and may be suitable as dynamic triggers. There are one or two that I have in mind and will attach to some charts shortly to see what if anything can be made of them. I hope to post a fresh MT4 chart setup sometime next week which may by then include a dynamic trigger. Keeping my fingers crossed.....

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Can't wait Then we will see who wins the fight lol Good luck trading today everyone

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Thanks GCTrader. That was a good trade. IG told me yesterday that they are planning to roll out some kind of auto-trade facility next spring, but whether that will be in Oz, I don't know. I guess a few good trades may go by the wayside before then. Thanks for the mouse randomizer. All I need to do now is to turn off the windows auto-updater computer restart function, which nuked the charts at 3am. It's a minefield! I spoke to the people from prorealtime today about my difficulty in getting the code to work on their probacktest (and the L value to adjust at all), and they speculated that it could be related to the fact that they quote prices using the interbank decimal place format, ie 164.88 rather than IG's 16,488 (EUR/JPY) and 1.4682 rather than 14,682 (EUR/USD). I tried hamfistedly to delete a few bits of code and change a few variables without magic results. Any ideas? Could be the same 'bug' that made it not work on cmc or other systems. + the MACD threshold (for exits) was the same for both. I am guessing that the way that the code was written for the probacktest, at least the version that doesn't reference the vanilla squeeze indicator, adds that extra bar?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I have finally coded the updating trigger level. I will post it when I have tweaked the code... Now you can change pairs and time and it self adjusts and displays what the trigger level is, real time. GCTrader This is the 10min chart im working the code for atm http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/6...xeurjpyaa7.png

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thanks GCTrader for an excellent system! I have a question, I am using MT4. "if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then .........." In my case the value of the MACDline is like 0.0020 or similar, I don't understand how the difference between the two values could be larger than A if A can have a value between 3 and 9?? Shouldn't also here be a factor 10 000 involved? Ola

--- 帖子 #244 ---
We ALL win!!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I just took the short on eur/jpy after a break south of the central pivot and increasing bandwidth from below 0056 I am a little nervous about this one as the previous candle was a hammer showing demand at this level Can anyone confirm this signal?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I'm on the IG charts, not got the signal yet.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I was just looking at that. I set a sell stop 15 pips below the pivot...waiting.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
GJ has almost the identical setup. It is below the pivot, 2 candles previous is an inverted hammer on my chart. Bandwidth is below .0056...going short. I think negative economic news is being released in 31 minutes for GBP

Hi GCTrader, How's the coding going for your other time frames and pairs? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Here is the beginning of the trigger level code. If anyone has any ideas, please speak now or forever hold your pips. L=(lowest[132](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C Where C is the trigger level buffer zone which ranges between 0.0001 and 0.002. Its a start

--- 帖子 #256 ---
yeah, cant really complain - I was 400 pips up with this strategy and that is the first loss of 30 pips. market seems consolidating and not prepared to make any move just yet, except to go and get our stop that is

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I am snake bit that way...you notice it is going down now...and it is past where I had my TP...oh well...stops save you to live another day!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hmm... anyone, I'm not a coder.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Man price is just all over that pivot point isn't it?? Bandwidth is still a little high I think??

--- 帖子 #260 ---
yeah that was the ugliest P.A I have seen after a signal - usually your on the positive side of the spread pretty quickly and then there is no looking back. The central bank liquidity measures are an unusal thing for traders to have to deal with. On the one hand its supposed to support the market, on the other hand it suggest things must be pretty bad for this type of unprecedented action. I think the bears will win in the end but its looking like a fair rumble first I think the year is over after that bit of price action Merry Christmas everyone. have a nice break, forget the market and go spend some quality time with friends and family. Its been a great year at FF for me. Ive learned alot from all of you so Ill see you all again next year

[FONT='Verdana','sans-serif']GCTrader1, I understand your system as below. Please correct me if I am wrong.[/font] [FONT='Verdana','sans-serif']Wait for the Bollinger bands to narrow. Then when Bollinger band widens and bandwidth is greater than 0.0056 and price has broken the pivot line and squeeze is blue/pink - you enter long/short. Am I correct? What do you mean by ‘breaking’ the pivot line? Do you mean the candle has to close below it then you enter or as price breaks through it you immediately enter?[/font] [FONT='Verdana','sans-serif']Thank you.[/font]

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi Eagle eye, If you have a read of the doc on the 3rd page of this thread you should get the jist of it. Entry is triggered by an increase of the bollinger bandwidth while being constricted. Entry is just one part of this strategy, the exits are just as important. Have a read of Forex conquered by Person for a better understanding of pivot points and confluences. When the bandwidth is constricted along a pivot point then it makes the break from it all that more meaningful. i.e the move should be significant. The bandwidth value 0.0056 is an arbitrary number that works well but I am working on the code for this to autoupdate itself especially when changing time frames and different pairs. As soon as I have it worked out I will post it for all to enjoy! ;-) I use It-finance charts which I get from IG, but also available from www.prorealtime.com GCTrader

Hi, I have an account with CMC . I did exactly like below and I got the squeeze indicator with a line of black bars (see below). Can someone take a look and tell me where I am going wrong. MAC Doug, are you using CMC, can you help please. Thanks

--- 帖子 #268 ---
HI Eagle Eye, Change the settings to Bandwidth to 0.0056 and MACD to 6 and Trigger to 18. That should do the trick. Regards, Guess

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Sorry Bandwith to 18 and Trigger to 0.0056.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks for your reply. I did that as you can see from attached shot. Firstly, when I change to 0.0056 it changes autmatically to 0.006. secondly, nothing shows up on the squeeze indicator. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I have been "out of the office" for a few days but am back for a little while before wrapping up (is that a pun?) for the holidays. Being a firm believer that there is beauty and genius in simplicity, I have tried to keep the following as straight forward as possible. I have decided that only four basic indicators are needed to create an MT4 equivalent of GCT's methodology (at least that is all that I personaly feel that I need). Please be aware that this setup is ment only for the EUR/JPY 1 hour timeframe. It may well work effectively with other timeframes and currency pairs but that is up to you to determine. The four indicators required are: 1. Bollinger bands with an 18,2 setting applied to the price chart. This is a standard indicator available in MT4 and does not need to be downloaded. 2. Bbsqueezedemarker8 as attached below. 3. Bbhistotest2 as attached below. 4. Pivot lines as attached below. Each of the indicators should be saved into your MT4 platform's Indicators folder. That is usually done by following the path: C rogram files/your MT4 name/Experts/Indicators. The "your MT4name" is usually the name of the provider (broker) where you got your Demo(live) account. As an example in my case it is Strategybuilderfx. I have also attached a template for the chart - that should make it easy to setup your chart. The Squeezedemarker8 Template should be saved in a similar manner as the indicators but into your MT4 Templates folder. (c rogram files/your MT4 name/Templates) After you have done that you should close (if it was already open) and then reopen your MT4 platform. You can now attach the template to a 1 hour EUR/JPY chart and it should look like the example that I have attached. You may wish to set the Magenta dots for Bbsqueezedemarker8 to a width of 2 to make them easier to see. This can be done in the properties box. The same can be done for the Green and Red dots of the Bbhisto. I will go through "How to read the indicators" in the next couple of posts as well as present a bit of interesting info pertaining to the Bollinger Squeeze method so please bear with me for a bit till I have a chance to do so.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
O.K as you have probably figured out right away, a Bollinger band squeeze is indicated by the Bbsqueezedemarker8 indicator when it prints a series of Magenta dots. I have marked them on the example chart with white triangles. When a Magenta dot first prints, that is our heads up that there may be an up coming trading opportunity.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
So, let's pretend that we are in a Bollinger sqeeze. If we now closely watch the Lime coloured demarker line cross the waterline (the 0.0 line) of the Bbsqueezedemarker8 indicator - that is our trade entry. I have marked them with yellow arrows on the example chart. Obviously some moves are better than others and this is something that we as traders must always contend with, hence we employ the usual protective measures such as stop losses, take profit and money management.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
The Bbhisto Green and Red dots can be used as a confirming indicator when it flips from one colour to the other. However, I find that this can be a bit of a lagging indicator and can sometimes put you into the trade a bit late. I have marked the flips with white rectangles on the example chart. I am not overly enamoured with this indicator and may decide to drop it at some point. The beautiful thing about the squeeze is that it can be traded just on chart visuals alone and does not need too many indicators to be tradable. To my way of thinking, anything that does not contribute in a meaningful way should be dropped and I find this indicator to be a bit marginal so in the future I may op for just the Bbsqueeze under the chart.

For those of us who pride ourselves with having nerves of steel, there is sometimes an early entry opportunity. On the Bbsqeezedemarker8 indicator when the Lime demarker line crosses the 0.2 or -0.2 level we can sometimes get a bit of an earlier entry therby adding a few more pips to the trade (see yellow arrows on example chart). A bit of caution is in order as sometimes this is not followed by a waterline crossing and the trade may turn against us rather quickly. Like everything else in Forex, there is no "Holy Grail". That of course should not deter us from at least attempting to come close and I think that this strategy is as good as any at doing that.

[quote=fxhermit;1761951]I have been "out of the office" for a few days but am back for a little while before wrapping up (is that a pun?) for the holidays. The four indicators required are: 1. Bollinger bands with an 18,2 setting applied to the price chart. This is a standard indicator available in MT4 and does not need to be downloaded. 2. Bbsqueezedemarker8 as attached below. 3. Bbhistotest2 as attached below. 4. Pivot lines as attached below. Fxhermit, Thanks a lot for sharing and explaning everythings. You said we need to save template however I cannot see any you posted. Am I missing something? Secondly, when I add bollinger bands in MT4 do I say 18 for period and 2 for deviations? How about apply to (close, open, high,low, etc) and shift sections? Are we keeping defaults for them?

I cant get the code to work properly either but I have a mate, johhny forex who is good with IT Finance code. I am waiting for him to make it work as it just frustrates the crap out of me wasting my time trying to figure out something that I dont understand.Ill let you know as soon as I have working indicators .Meantime I just watch the indicators and trade it manually. The set ups are cleary visible without the indicator telling you so. My hope is to get the code working and then set up email alerts like CGT is doing, so I dont have to watch the screen. I am also going to give fxhermits mt4 set up a go, (if I can get that to work! - lol)

GCTrader1 has made some mention of using a dynamic entry level trigger and is, I believe, currently working on the code for such for the IT Finance platform. In keeping with this concept, I have attempted to do the same with the Bbsqeezedemarker8 indicator. Thanks to the coder's who initially created this indicator and to those who so kindly made some great modifications to it, we are able to also have a dynamic entry signal. One of the features of this version of Bbsqeeze is that it includes demarker as an oscillator. Those of you who have some experience and knowledge with demark trendlines know that trades are based on price breakouts of the demark trendlines which are drawn according to a defined set of rules. I am not going to get into the theory of demark trendlines here - if you are interested, just do a little search - there is lots of info right here on Forex Factory as well as elsewhere and will keep you busy reading for a while, I'm sure . Suffice it to say that the Lime coloured demarker oscillator reacts to price in a dynamic way. We want entry signals based on price expansion (volatility) after a sqeeze and that is pretty well the same as a demark trendline breakout. Thus, in my humble opinion, this indicator should suit our purposes nicely. Just thought you may want to know why I chose it.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
[quote=Fx97;1762010] Sorry, I missed attaching the template. Please find attached to this post. Bollinger is 18 for period, 2 for deviation, shift 0 and applied to the close. Hope that helps.

Since this methodology is based on the Bollinger band squeeze concept, I would like to expound a little about the Bbsqueeze and how the Magenta dots are derived. This indicator actually uses the interaction between two indicators, the Bollinger bands (Green) and another indicator called Keltner channels (blue). The coding calculates when the Bollinger bands narrow to within the Keltner channel. This condition constitutes the start of a squeeze. I have attached a chart showing both the bollinger bands as well as the Keltner channel overlaying the price chart. The vertical blue lines that I have drawn on the chart show where Bollinger bands have entred within the Keltner channels. As you can see this corresponds with a printing of the Magenta squeeze dots. Thought that you might also find the attached documents interesting. Thanks Akuma99.

Let's not forget that we should also be aware of price in relation to the pivot points. As GCT has pointed out, trades that are triggered when price moves away from the pivot are often the higher probability trades. Idealy what we want is "all ducks in a row" before we pull the trigger on the trade. As with any method, when you first start to use it please do your own due diligence by practicing and doing a little forward testing. Prove to yourself that you can be profitable with this method before going live. A well rounded strategy that takes into account stop loss placement, take profit targets and money management will hopefully help to assure your survival in Forex for a long time to come. May the pips be with you.

Fxhermit, Again thanks for your hard work and genourisity. I did save all files and created my chart. I have couple of questions for you. 1) I am using North Finance demo account and my chart looks very similar to yours. However, I have different R and S values. Do you have any idea why? Please see my attached picture. 2) I online figured out how to calculate R and S values (1,2,3) from the presentation by John Person. He gave all formulation but what I did not understand is are we using daily, weekly, or monhtly values? Any explanation on this appreciated. 3) I guess I understand how to decide to enter ( let Magenta dots print first as an indicator of upcoming trade) then use the Lime colored demarker line cross the waterline (the 0.0 line) of the Bbsqueezedemarker8 indicator as a trigger. You also said that 0.2 and -0.2 levels can be used as an early entry opportunities. Could you please tell us how you figure out the value of 0.2 ( such as why not 0.15)? 4) What are the signs for exit? 5) I am not sure how to decide if it is buy or sell order. Could you please explain this? 6) Do you feel like you did totally capture GCtrader1's system in MT4 platform? ( GCTrader1 thanks a lot for sharing your system)

--- 帖子 #283 ---
FXhermit, As always, your contribution here and to everyone that is following this system is much appreciated. Especially since there are alot of MT4 users out there and with your understanding of the concept. Finally I have come up with the indicator which im sure can still be worked on but it is definitely progressing. Here is the code for the new indicator. This will work for people that are with IGMarkets -------------------------------------------------------------------------- b=18 L=(lowest[period](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C trigger = undefined rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then trigger = 0 endif rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =-1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then trigger = 0 endif return trigger Variables A MACD Threshold Range 2-10 C Trigger Buffer Range 0.0001 - 0.002 PERIOD Sample period for Trigger Range 24 - 250 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here is a pic of it at work with trigger line accentuated. *values still need to be adjusted* http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/3...xaudusdqf1.png

--- 帖子 #284 ---
For those that are using or are trialing prorealtime charts, the following code will work for that. The difference is the value of the MACD. The values had to be multiplied by 100 before rounding and absolute before comparing... Anyway, here is the code... ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- b=18 L=(lowest[SAMPLE](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close))*100)&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))*100) then buy 1 shares at market endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])*100))) - (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)*100)))&gt;=A then sell 1 shares at market realtime endif rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close))*100)&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))*100) then sellshort 1 shares at market endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])*100))) - (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)*100)))&gt;=A then exitshort 1 shares at market realtime endif

Trading Tips 1) In order for you to be successful as a trader, you cannot anticipate an outcome; you must develop the patience to wait for your triggers, and you must also develop the discipline to follow through with that trigger. 2) When the price target has been met and the trigger has presented itself, enter the trade without hesitation. Do not think about the entry; this should be a mechanical process. Your system is in place, and this is part of your system. 3) Successful traders have the courage to act and act promptly.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hey GCT, What time do you start trading?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Discipline, discipline, discipline... Thats right. We all nedd to learn... So, GCTrader, can you post your current chartfor EURJPY and maybe give some of your thoughts for upcoming trade ( I do not know if you also see that). I would like to compare it to MT4 chart. Here is mine...

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Sure champ, http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/3...xeurjpyjo7.png Chart 1 http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/6...xeurjpyxp0.png Chart 2 As you can see from chart 1, the bollinger bandwidth is contracting nicely. It is still contracting tho and is nowhere near a pivot point, so a trade is definitely not recommended at this time. On chart 2 you can see a very constricted bandwidth, which at the 10min time frame, can signal a short 20pip trade quite regularly. Which I keep an eye on but dont trade unless really tight and not normally on a monday. So until this puppy starts trading and constricting along a pivot point, its a no trade for now. And that is called patience for those flipping through different pairs right now looking for a fix. This is trading, not gambling. Gambling is what I did till 4am this morning at the casino...see the difference? lol. Now Im off for a hit. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I like gambling too, in fact like only poker nothing else. Anyway, in your explanation document, in first page I believe, you are using MACD to decide if it is buy or sell. So , without MACD in your chart how do you decide if it is short or long trade? I did read all thread however, I think I have missed some thing or got totally confused

--- 帖子 #290 ---
MACD is still in system Texas hold em' all the way! lol

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Thats right I do not think that there is any better game... So, GCTrader1 , has your system been changed from the first post since I have seen some post regarding modifications to your system? If it is right can you give highlights?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi FX97, I'll try to answer as best as I can: Questions 1 &amp; 2. From looking at your chart it seems that your broker prints a Sunday bar. Some brokers do and it looks like and extra day to the pivot indicator and how it calculates the pivot therefore the difference between your chart and mine. Some don't and they just incorporate it in the Monday data. It is not uncommon for data feeds to vary from broker to broker and price bars to print slightly differently from platform to platfotm. You will occassionally find the same sort of discussion amoungst Price Action traders (James16 thread) as to why the suppossedly same charts look different from broker to broker. The conclussion is usually that you should treat the charts you are looking at as your "window of truth". That is where you will be placing and managing your trades. Unfortunatley it does not always make it easy for us all to be exactly on the same page when posting and analysing charts. Question 3. Good question - no reason why it couldn't be .15 I suppose. All of these levels on oscillators are some what arbitrary. They are usually ment to signal a change in mood of the indicator. For example a common indicator that most traders are familiar with is the Stochastic. It uses levels of 80 and 20 to delineate overbough/oversold conditions for price and when it moves through those levels it is usually considered that price action is changing in some way. The same is true for the 0.2 and -0.2 levels of this indicator. It is actually the default setting used by the coder for the demarker part of the indicator. I would presume that the reason why they are the defaults is that these levels most appropriately define a change in mood of the indicator in the same manner as the aforemention levels do for the Stochastic. For us, that should translate as price movement out of the squeeze. Many other oscillator type indicators have their own default levels as well. They act as another "heads up" area for the trader. Since they are early signals there is usually a higher risk of false signals at these levels, yet when they are descisively broken often yield generous pips. Question 4: Signs for exit are for the time being those that are recommended by GCTrader1 such as exiting at R or S pivots. If I remember correctly, earlier on in the thread GCT mentioned the use of MACD as an exit. You may want to review some of the earlier posts (as I suppose I should as well ) for recommended exits. I will try and flesh out take profit as well as stop loss strategies at some future point - they are such a subject unto themselves. P.S. GCTrader1 just confirmed MACD use in a post or two previous. Question 5: Glad you asked, although this part is not really rocket science, it sure is all important - there is obviously no trade if you don't pull the trigger. A buy trigger is when the Lime coloured demarker oscillator moves UP through the Waterline (0.0) and the dots are Magenta. The reverse is true for a sell trigger. Question 6. As is life, a work in progress. GCTrader1's methodology is theoretically tradeable with a price chart that ONLY has the Bollinger band on it. Squeezes of the Bollinger bands are quite visual and rather easy to recognize. Actually a pretty good way to train one's eye is to create just such a chart and have it open next to the one that you are trading. After a while you may be pleasantly surprised at the clarity of vision that this nearly naked chart provides. The Bollinger dance is a thing of beauty and goes on all week. Transposing a methodology from one platform to another is a translation at best. I have, because of my limited knowledge of coding relied on already existing MT4 indicators so have I totally captured GCT's system? No, probably not, but I hope to have come close. I'm sure that over time both approaches will reveal their unique strengths and weaknesses. Every trader has to prove to themselves that what ever methodology they adapt, that they can be profitable with it. Don't be to quick to leap, practice a bit first - opportunity will always abound and it is doubtful that there will ever be a scarcity.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Great advice. Once a trader has a working knowledge of their methodology and knows it to be do-able and profitable you gotta have the confidence to trade and trade decisively. Great work with your coding and the progress that you are making. It is indeed an honour to participate in this thread and contribute a bit here and there. I would encourage others to include their feedback, thoughts and ideas - no thread ever has too many posts .

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Good thinking - the MT4 version lacks a track record and needs a reasonable bit of forward testing to show it's metal. My own curiosity needs to be satisfied as to whether or not this configuration is reliable. A comparison is an excellent way to go.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I feel like I just stole $200.00 (actually more like $174.00!! $200.00 just sounds better). I went in 1 full lot at 163.18 and closed at 162.98...20 pips! Price is right on S1 as I type this! Baby gonna get those shoes!! Waiting now...have a sell stop (1/2 lot!) 10 pips south of S1....baby need a new car!~

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Another 20 pips...I am done for the day! Love this system!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I went in at 16328 and out at the S1 line at 16276. 10min was looking VERY constricted and while I wouldnt have recommended it to anyone else, I went in when my 10min system gave the go ahead. It is good for short times in the market with smaller TP levels as at this level you are more trading noise although it can be a precursor to larger moves and gets you in earlier. You can see from my previous post how constricted that level really was... Veddy nice! Hi 5! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hey GCT, Got to agree with an earlier post (as I'm a little confused here) ... you mention using the MACD to choose your direction of trade, yet I do not see it on your charts. Can you please confirm the application of MACD in your system, thanks. P.S. As MACDoug has commented, I'm hoping soon to code up your system also into PRT, hopefully with several tweaks of my own that I've incorporated into other systems I've been working on. I'm talking 20 pages of code though, so I need to sift through this carefully to utilise some ideas and discard others - but we should end up with a very nice backtest and a psuedo 'black box' indicator (similar to your entry indicator if you like) which will take much of the work out. Your use of MACD though for entry and exit though I am not entirely sure of.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Johnny, The Macd is one type of entry or exit strategy that can be used. In the code or indeed just visually looking at the chart the direction can be easily picked by which way the breakout is headed from the constriction. In the code, it is easily added to pick the direction of the trade. Same thing for the exit, it is used to evaluate if the move is over or it has just stalled. That is why I have the MACD Threshold. It compares the current value of the MACD signal to the previous bar and if that value goes over the threshold, it exits the position. As I said, it is one form of exit. Another VERY effective exit strategy is to stage out at pivot points. I hope this clarifies it and I cant wait to have a look at your code. Im a code geek, what can I say! Here is a pic of my layout, although it cuts off one of my screens! The screen capture mustnt be able to see all 4. lol GCTrader http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/7...kspace1jm7.jpg

GCT first thanks for the system, been live backtesting it from july '07 up until now with vterminal for mt4 and gotta say eurjpy seems perfect for the job at least this year, as for gbp/jpy I have a feeling you will get it down pretty nicely, most congestion should be right before the London open if I remember right, I might try to test a year or so of that soon, except I need some sleep, been looking at the charts for maybe 15-20 hours straight now def. a nice system if you get the feel for it, it really can't go wrong especially with eurjpy, I tried a couple of other pairs too, not as easy cheers m8, will report back if I do more testing Also, fxhermit thanks for your compilation, it's a good starter kit for this

--- 帖子 #307 ---
O, just some ideas GCT since you've been using this for longest, Do you use weekly,monthly pivots with this at all or fibs looking for confluence for more sure moves? Just to throw that out there for anyone interested to try so far I've tried weekly and some monthly, weekly seems to have a pretty decent effect on pa on eurjpy at least the range I tested.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi Guess, That is the indicator code for the squeeze including the autoupdate trigger, not the backtest. If you enter that in as you see it, it should work once the variables are entered. What problems are you having? GCTrader

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Weekly pivot points are another great pivot point to watch out for. When they are close to a daily pivot point, get ready for a big bounce when the price hits it! Monthly not so much, I dont know anyone that uses monthly. Fib IMO is snake oil, put that many lines on a graph and its bound to hit some eventually. : With pivot points, you can see day after day it hitting them and bouncing off or stagnating around them. With them there is no question that the market keeps an eye on them. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Eventually...hehe Personally I hold some weight on weekly fibs as the main levels are often good points to watch for minor pullbacks etc since many people still use them, havn't tried it with this pair yet, havn't really followed this pair before but think I got the feel of it over last night going over half a year of data. How's g/j looking?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Some possible trades coming up... keep an eye on the EURYEN and AUSSIE. Will let you know if any signal is given, but most should know by now what to look for. GCTrader http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/4...xeurjpysi2.png http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/6...xaudusdor8.png

Hey There GCT!! Been trading your system since the very beginning and all I can say Is this is a winner in the FX market, great selection of the primary pair the EUR/JPY works a charm! Thanks again

--- 帖子 #313 ---
GCT, in terms of entering, what do you base your entrance on in relation to the pivots, do you go by the initial bounce or wait for any pullbacks for confirmation before entering? G/J seems to have a lot of pullbacks ~50pip etc after initial bounce after consolidation before continuing with the trend not sure how much it is true for other pairs

--- 帖子 #314 ---
It seems like we got very good buy signal here is the chart from Fxhermit indicators I am long at 162.84

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Fxhermit, Thanks a lot for taking your time answering my questions. You are great. So, For the answers 1&amp;2: My understanding is we are calculating and using daily pivots in this system. If that is right, when these pivot points recalculated? or are they dynamically change? For the answer 3: Thanks for explanation, and it is really nice to hear that you know what you are doing. Excellent For the answer 4: I am also using MACD as an exit point. However, I need to understand it better. Anyway. For the answer 5: I think this is one of the biggest issue right now. See chart below (In the next post). Look at the rectangular box in blue. At the beginning of blue box magenta dots prints and lime color demarker oscillator moves UP ( but sure does not cross the waterline. So, what I thought was it was going to be BUY signal, and since waterline was not crossed I did not enter buy order. However, there was nothing showed us the SELL signal. On the other hand, GCtrader1 and one other guy were able to see SELL signal from their system. I think this is really really important and we need to figure out in MT4 platform and in our indicators. Please let me know if we are on the same page about this item. For the answer 6: Thanks alot for your hard work, and I think I can contribute with my questions and feedback. On the other hand I invited Saaedb to this thread. He is great with MT4. He has developed very nice EA for Nicotina's method http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...51365&amp;page=101 and I am sure he will be very helpfull to this thread if he choose to involve

In my humble opinion...price is still constricting and it is right on a pivot point. Remember European session doesn't open for another 90 minutes...volatility is really low right now. If it were me...I'd stay in it. I am still getting a buy signal..and bandwidth is below .0056...I would ride it out. You can't reap the benefit of a win if you aren't willing to take the loss!!

The latest breakout looks strong with the R1 line broken half position could be exited for staging out and SL moved to entry. Aim is the R2 line. The aussie was another good signal given but continued to consolidate around the PP until finally breaking it. First TP is the R1 line which almost got hit just then.

The Pivot is calculated from the previous day's data and will update on the opening of a new day. Be aware that end of day may vary from broker to broker - this is not a concern - just trade what you see. It just means that the charts we post may look a little different from each other. GCTrader1 has a criteria for using MACD that is probably as good as any. Remember, he also takes into consideration Pivot points as exit targets. As useful as MACD is, I find that it (and this is a characteristic with most indicators) can have a fair bit of lag. Yes, the squeeze that you indicated on your chart does not have a crossover of the waterline as an entry signal. I agree with you that this is definately a concern. One of the problems when using already existing indicators for MT4 to try and mimic a methodology programmed for another platform is that it is exactly that - a mimic. That is the result of my limited knowledge of MT4 coding. The only true way around this is to have GCTrader1's parameters and formulas coded from scratch into MT4 format. That is beyond my skill level. Hopefully your astute thinking of inviting Saaedb to have a go at the code will pay off . In the mean time, as Jonaslt mentioned in a previous post, we at least have a good starter kit . What is really attractive about GCT'S method is that it is wonderfully mechanical in it's approach - get a signal, pull the trigger kind of thing. With the current state of the MT4 setup there is still a fair bit of trader discretion required. For instance, in the chart example that you posted it would be up to the trader to determine that the price was in a down leg. This means that one can expect trend continuation setups as the down leg develops. In this case that would have ment using other criteria than the indicators themselves to catch this particular trade. One trader may have used a break of support, another a trader's trick entry, another a MACD bar, etc, etc..... So you can see how quickly trader discretion can become a bit of a can of worms. Let's hope someone comes forward who can produce some clean code for us. I guess our other option is to move to Europe and become IT Finance clients.... hmmm come to think of it that might be kind of fun .

Thanks alot for your answers. I really appreciate your time... And I am also glad that we are on the same page. I think you have done great job for putting this system into MT4 platform. Additionally, Saaedb asked me to put explanation together for this system, basically summarizing this thread and he said he will work on the creating MT4 part of it. My plan is to have GCTrader1's explanation on the first page plus have your posts where you are explaning all system and your indicators. I hope we can somehow also automate this sytem through EA. Will see that. Maybe the best solution is to move to Europe live in Tuscany drink wine good food and trade there.. Well wouldn't it be wonderfull

--- 帖子 #332 ---
GCTrader, Can you explain in your chart why it was a false breakout ?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
fx97, False breakouts happen all the time unfortunately and there isnt too much you can do about it. Sure in hindsight people will tell you, oh it was because of this and that but hindsight is always 20-20. Sometimes there is no reason for it and no-one to this date has been able to consistently predict the market. It is a sea of rational and irrational people going in and out of the market, central banks manipulating the market and corporations hedging their large purchases in a years time. So in saying that, I believe I have come up with a system that is right more times than not. I go in regardless, if I get stopped out, so be it. I know the real profitable trade is just one click away but if i dont hit that button, how am I to profit from a trade im not in? Unfortunately, while I was out there was a trade I was keeping an eye on. I was waiting for it to break down and signal an entry. Low and behold I come back to this... http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/1...xeurjpymb7.png Typical, lol. Did anyone get in on the break down of the pivot point? Nice 40 pips of justice! Hope I answered your question to a satisfactory level. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #334 ---
On the subject of stop losses, I know you mentioned you use wide stop losses, do you base thme on anything in particular that you found works best? opposite side of pivots, R or S on the other side, I've been trying different things but some are either hit too often or when hit produce huge losses in some cases. Another quick question, do you stay out of any of these trades based on where it is on the larger scale, monthly/weekly highs or etc. I've noticed a lot of long consolidations along those with sometimes 2-4 false breakouts especially early 2007. Let me know your thoughts, and once again thanks, Jonas

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hey Jonas, With my stop losses, I normally use a fairly wide stop for the simple fact that I have learned my lesson of tight stop losses. Some systems I guess they are good but I really hate it when I pick the trade right, hits my stop then goes in the direction I predicted. I stay in the trade till either my stoploss is hit, or my system says the move is dead which is pretty obvious by that time. When it comes to values, I put it on the other side of big numbers and pivot points, normally about 10 pips. Trust me, I have learnt through tears! Second question, I am always listening to the market...Ransquawk, it is invaluable! Also read the financial review every morning. Just about to get my new 37" monitor which always helps fitting plenty of information, just dont know where its gonna fit. Already have 3 * 19" and a 22" monitors and one of them is on a swing arm so they fit on my desk! Have to work on that one. Please someone tell me you got in on this trade of JUSTICE! http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/8...xeurjpyxq4.png

Greetings, Thanks for sharing this GCTrader. It's much appreciated and as someone in an earlier post mentioned, makes pretty good sense in forex. Thanks for the metatrader set up FXHermit. I've been using this successfully for the past week on a 15 minute chart with setting of .0018 for the squeeze. Here's a screen shot of last night's trade. I entered at the break of the pivot, set tp to 162.75 and went to bed...Pacific Standard Time. Regards

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Glad to hear someone saw that signal and acted, I am so cut that I missed that one! I did get the aussie which again you can see on the 15 min chart. This system on the 15 min chart does give some good quality early signals as well. Multiple time frames can alert you to a much bigger picture trade.

Current trigger levels for those without the autotrigger are:- Hourly EURJPY - 0.0036 AUDUSD - 0.0044 15 min EURJPY - 0.0028 AUDUSD - 0.0024

Welcome to the rainbows, that's how my screens have been looking for the past couple days haha. Think I'm just used to a black background from previous years with various applications, white doesn't bring out the details as much to me anymore.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
it looks like the g/j is ready to breakout, the BB are all consolidated and ready to explode, just a nice butterfly getting ready to fly. My guess is a move up to the 227 area from here. We will see in the next next few hours...any thoughts

--- 帖子 #342 ---
If you take a look at a 4 hour chart it just broke out pretty big so this move shouldn't be big, also take a look where the pivot point is, it's ~50 points away so it won't be as easy to say where it will go, it might break down ~80ish points down to the weekly S1 and come back up since the weekly has more influence on it than the daily, can't say for sure until PA doesn't start moving based simply on that time frame but ya it's moving together nicely, looking at the 15min chart it has a tight gap currently :-) Just my 2c, not sure how right I am, I haven't traded all this live yet just live tested months of history so far, good luck if you take anything on this

--- 帖子 #343 ---
O, also I just checked G/U and U/J and seems they will take some time consolidating, wonder if that means G/J will die down even more since the other 2 will take some hours, not sure if it has any effect.

Hi, Can anyone explain in a simple manner the process of entering a trade . (I have downloaded the MT template from FXhermit.) Plus how you know the direction in which to place an order. Great work by every one on this subject. Thanks Nightpipper.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
possible trade coming on aussie, bandwidth is down to .004 on the hourly as for entering the trade read over the first couple of pages of the thread and you'll know, but it's bandwidth+narrowing bollinger bands+pivot points for direction and confluence sorry don't have much time atm

--- 帖子 #349 ---
AUDUSD is down to a 0.003 on the PP, keep an eye on it for a breakout. Also, here are voice entry signals to replace a bell. They say in a sexy female voice(always helps) buy euro yen, 10 minute. And other ones. Let me know what other pairs you want, works very well on my computer! GCTrader

Yet again I miss out on a nice trade, anyone make some pips on this? http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/2...xeurjpyqb6.png

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Hi Nightpipper, Check out the doc on page 3 of this thread, that outlines the concept of this strategy. The indicators and backtests are not based on MT4 charts, they are based on IT-Finance charts which are available through- http://www.prorealtime.com/common/partner.phtml?page=main&amp;language=EN&amp;from=GCT You can sign up for a trial to check it out, just copy and paste the code!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi, The last two nights (Pacific Standard Time) have been brilliant for this trading method... wonder how long that will last. Good stuff...thanks. Regards

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi GCtrader, Have been following your thread, addicted to it! Thanks so much. I managed to set up the first Squeeze indicator &amp; probacktest. I cant seem to get the new auto-update trigger indicator right though. Could you please do another one of the storybooks, if you dont mind. Thanks again!!

My BBands Squeeze indicator for MT4.. I'm MQL4 programmer and can make EA ( or semi automatic EA ) for this system if some one post SETUP for open and close positions... (Sorry for bad English..)

--- 帖子 #356 ---
To fxhermit or anyone who can help, Can you add an audible alert to the BB Squeeze indicator from post#271 ? Or does anyone have, or can add one to, the Demarker oscillator that comes standard with MT4 to alert when it crosses 0.5 ? Thanks a miilion!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi Alexish, Well if you can create an indicator creates bars in a window. When we get a squeeze from the squeeze indicator (attached) and the value the user enters when the BBandWidthRatioHisto reaches that value, you should have a bar appear on the screen. Not sure if anyone wants to add anything. The indicators are attached in this thread, if you require them, then I will post them. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I like it, actually gives the ratio unlike the other one, in either case...GCT suggested to exit with the MACD thresthold 6.2, wondering if that would be variable same as the minimum bandwidth for the past 5.5 days on the hourly... Would be interesting to have an EA for optimization and see over all results if you take all results and how many it would screw up, for entrance would you just enter every trade in the direction of macd as bandwidth jumps up from minimum? I'm still trying to see what would be the most reliable entrance method as to eliminate fake break outs

--- 帖子 #359 ---
New Bands Squeeze v.2 with alerts for MT4! Any errors? Please let me know..

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I'm wondering if instead of a concrete level if you could add a variable level option as GCT changed his to this, it's based on the last 132 bars I believe that's what he is using which is more accurate than a concrete level. I need to start learning mt4 scripting soon bit my bit, heh

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Alexish... Your a legend... Thank you!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Yes I agree with this as well... he is using MACD for something as well, which I need to go back and read again. Alexish, do you need the code that he written, I can supply this? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Omar, Who are you using for charts? Prorealtim or from a broker? IT-Finance charts are awesome, but they do have discrepancies between them that you need to be aware of in the code. The auto trigger removes the need to always adjust the trigger level from an arbitrary number to a number derived from the low of the previous sample period of the bollinger bandwidth. You can change timeframe and pair with little modification to the variables for it to work. For example, here it is on the daily...just in case you dont want to be a day trader! Resulting in 961 pips since october 18. This system works with almost all timeframes. http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/8...xaudusdfk1.png

--- 帖子 #364 ---
The MACD is used for the entry direction detection(say that 10 times real fast!lol) and also as a way of detecting a turnaround in the trend for exits, which I use in conjunction with pivot point TP levels and staging out. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #365 ---
A little to the side but GCT, for entry what difference are you looking for in the bandwidth while it's already under and how many bars do you look for for a confirmation of the increase, I know it goes together with pivot points and macd also for direction and there's some discretion just wondering what confirmations you try to look for. I've been playing around with that last couple of nights and getting mixed results with different ideas heh

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hey Jonas, The code looks for a difference of 1, so if it reading 0.0030 and moves to 0.0031 it will signal an entry. The first bar to do so signals a trade. While adding in another bar that increases again could increase the reliability of the trades, im not having too much trouble with that anyway and it would of course signal you to enter after the bull has already run the gate in some instances. If the system calls for a trade, then I trade. If it signals a trade while breaking any pivot point, I go in with more units because these moves tend to be more reliable and can be larger. Hope this has helped, but if you have any ideas that you think might help, please email me and I will code it and see how it runs! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Alexish, This is the code. b=18 L=(lowest[period](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C trigger = undefined rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger = endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then trigger = endif 0 rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =- endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then trigger = endif 0 return trigger

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thanks to GCTrader for this!!! [quote=guess121;1768926]Alexish, This is the code.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I see, maybe I'm more pessimistic and want more confirmation haha, but in this case there would be a bit of false breakouts, especially in areas where on high time frame the bandwidth is decreasing or increasing by a small amount right before or after a breakout so it would potentially only show you a direction of where it will go for a small time but not necessarily a break out. Not sure if what I said makes any sense let me know, But like you said theres some discretion which trades to take and to leave so it works for you just trying to define better how to eliminate the bad ones myself, also in this way an EA would be able to exclude some bad ones.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi GCTrader, I'm using the IGMarkets' IT Finance charts. Maybe you can tell me where I've gone wrong - I create a new indicator, paste the new trigger code post #283). Then when I validate it tells me I've got a syntax error, needing to define variables : period, A &amp; C. I think its the variables I need help with- the 'Type', 'Restriction' and 'Default value" bit. Should I be just editing the old/first squeeze indicator? Or am I right to create a new indicator. I know zip about programming so please excuse my un-tech savvyness. Guess121 - I saw an earlier post of yours where you said you had a problem with the new coding. Looks like you've managed to sort it out, any advise? Thanks, and apologies for bothering you guys with the little nitty gritty bits. Ur time is much appreciated! Cheers

ALEXISH, Thanks for posting. You can find details about this system through word document posted by GCTrader. Look for post#33 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...t=57426&amp;page=3 Fxhermit has done great job for applying this system to MT4 and just he said we definitely need more improvement. You sound like you are very efficient with MQL4 and your idea about creating EA and automating this system is great. I think this system is so great and with youe EA we can turn it to huge success for MT4 platform. Please let us know if you need anything..

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Thanks for posting these metatrader charts guys. I'm trading the 15 min chart and while I have the price at the pivot, I don't have the squeeze. The MACD on my chart is approaching zero...don't know if it will bounce or not. Good luck Sorry, Thanks for the indicator Alexish

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Yeah, I've been looking at different tf but still not sure how much they correlate together while looking at the bandwidth, however, I trust in the system and the bandwidth was low enough on the hourly, even though we didn't have many bars under it..we'll see what happens Looking at the 4H chart it would make sense for it to go up but then again you can't look for anything just to justify your trade I'm going with the initial signal and wait for it to go south. On the 15min do you only trade the big breakouts that come on the 1H also or you take anything that triggers the low bw and pivots?

Hi jonaslt, I have only recently stumbled across this thread - two weeks ago. I trade only demo. GCTrader1 has generously shared something quite brilliant here...particularly with regard to the Eur/Jpy. I only trade the 15 minute chart. The last two nights have had serious moves after 11:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time... what that means in the future, who knows...but GC's concept is sound. That would be GMT-8...couple of hours from now. Regardless, we should all send flowers to his mother on Mother's Day and thank her for teaching her son to share. Cheers

--- 帖子 #384 ---
No problem, I looked for it myself since I have the same setup you have, but I think with a couple more bands it's easier to see what is happening, couple other charts I actually added one copy of a higher tf bollinger to try to figure out the relationship and how it all works. btw sundown, I'm new to this one too, last week or so I've been practicing this method and trying to refine it in my own head and the way I would use it and when, I'm trying to do live back testing using vterminal so far went through a year or so in total just to have that practice trying different things. But your def. right it's all thanks to GCT for sharing what he's doing and helping everyone here out, how's that for X-Mas spirit haha By the way, the reason I'm doing hourly is simply because lower tf has a lot of noise, but this is what I think and many people will argue me, I love short term trades since I'm still pretty new to trading and need more practice with my nerves haha but I am also a strong believer of price action and what other people in this forum have to say fti,james16 etc, not sure if it's helping me or hurting me, we'll see how quickly I can find my own consistent profitable way of trading so far I'm still a little shaky but always trading demo is one thing I try to get some experience with live as well just to have that practice since it's much different even though I never believed that before. There's just that funny feeling in your stomach that you get trading live when you're relatively new to it haha I'm sure some of the older traders here remember those times...or maybe I just had some bad food

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Greetings, I am using Metatrader charts and all I have done that is different is change the colour (CDN) of the bands and drop some of the bands fxhermit originally had on his chart.

Ok, story book time! To get this indicator working, follow these steps. 1) The charts I use are from prorealtime http://www.prorealtime.com/common/pa...ge=EN&amp;from=GCT 2) Now select indicator/backtest up the top right of the chart 3) Select new indicator and name it. 4) copy and paste the code from previous posts as shown here http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/7299/story1li1.jpg 5) Next, set up the variables which are up the top right and enter in as follows http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/100/story2gh0.jpg http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/3159/story3zk1.jpg http://img299.imageshack.us/img299/116/story4yk6.jpg 6) Now to setup the trigger level on the bollinger bandwidth. Add another indicator, select bollinger bandwidth. 7) Create another indicator called trigger and enter in trigger = undefined trigger=(lowest[sample](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+A return trigger 8) The variables are A Trigger Float float &gt;0 0.002 Sample sample period integer &gt;0 38 9) Click validate then close the indicator. 10) go back to the Bollinger bandwidth indicator setup and hit add, go to the trigger indicator. It should come up on the bollinger bandwidth now. That should be it, if you have any problems just post and I will see what I can do... Enjoy! GCTrader

Hi GCTrader, Thanks for your generosity in sharing this method . I used to be a subscriber to ProRealTime/IT-Finance, and felt very blessed when CMC adopted their charting platform . I've been attempting to duplicate your original BACKTEST as opposed to the INDICATOR. I'll put up the inidicator on the charts, but I'd like to have the backtest as a point of reference, as well as to add more lots on backtest confluence trades. In the original .doc file you have the variables as follows: P PIVOT DEVIATION MIN 0 MAX 40 STEP 1 L TRIGGER MIN 0.003 MAX 0.008 STEP 0.0001 B BOLLINGER BANDWIDTH MIN 17 MAX 27 STEP 1 A MACD THRESHOLD MIN 3 MAX 9 STEP 0.1 When attempting to create the backtest, the variable possibilities are &gt;0, &gt;=0, or no restriction. Can you clarify which option for each variable? My platform just seems to hang when optimizing . Thanks for your efforts and happy pipping to everyone . Jam

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Those variables are for an older version of this code, use the ones from the story book on this page. Also, what is you MACD values given in? Sometimes the code has to be modified since in IGmarkets, MACD is given in whole numbers but with prorealtime, they are in decimals. This difference needs to be taken into account in the code by making sure that the MACD values are in whole numbers, so multiplying it by 100. Let me know how u go... GCTrader

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Got the bandwith and trigger up with no problem. But the squeeze indicator as posted comes up blank on the charts. Any suggestions? After the squeeze indicator is put up, it seems you can adjust the settings manually and the MACD threshold can be adjusted to decimal levels. Where would one adjust the code to compensate (if that is indeed the problem)? Below is the code as entered in the squeeze indicator, and all the variables have been adjusted according to your latest storybook post.

Jam, Replace body of code with this... b=18 L=(lowest[SAMPLE](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close))*100)&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))*100) then trigger = 1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram.

Hi GCTrader, I cut and pasted exactly as you had posted. I get the following error: Syntax error This variable is never read: period This variable is undefined: sample

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I managed to get somethingup on the chart for the squeeze indicator now. The problem seems to be with the trigger float variable. I have tried all the settings. The setting for the TRIGGER FLOAT should be C, TRIGGER FLOAT, FLOAT, &gt;0, and 0.0003. The challenge is that the program doesn't seem to like 0.0003 as a setting and keeps changing it back to 0.001.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
hmmm, could be a cmc specific problem. Try a trial from the link on my previous post and try it there. cmc might not allow u to go down to 4 decimal places

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I'm actually quite pleased being able to get something up on the charts within a very short period of time, even if it's not perfected yet. I'll take your suggestion and try a demo on ProRealtime and see if it makes a difference. Attached is the chart at this point with a more similar colour scheme. Cheers, Jam

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Looking good there jam, just need to figure out that minimum number problem. No entries on any timeframe for now. Already made some good trades for the day... Im only using 2 pairs atm, AussieUSD and Euroyen. I have timeframes 1HR, 15min, 30min, 2hours and daily.

GCTrader, YOU ARE THE MAN. EXCELLENT SYSTEM... I DID MY 100 PIPS....

--- 帖子 #412 ---
hello guys. I posted on this thread in the beginning using a variation of this system (the acutal 12 b.bands around the price) along with Dollie's system. I am posting 2 trades I got today (I'm a scalper). Are we any closer to getting at MT4 Squeeze indicator or is it a lost cause. I would love to add that to my arsenal. GCT - if not, does your platform allow for free demos so I can access the charts?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
MT4 squeeze indicator is done, and his platform allows demos I believe as a couple people here have tried it, just go over last couple of pages it's all there

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thanks Jon.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
here is another successful scalp. I hope you are proud GCT!!!!

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi jcblcs79, Don't mean to be rude... but does not meet Dollies entries, or can you explain your entries a little more, then that would be great. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I really don't want to Discuss Dollie's system here (don't want to be rude - this thread is for GCTrader system). I only posted those trades to show how I incorportated the squeeze. But here is a quick explanation: Dollies original setup has 4 separate indicators layed on top of each other all set up to different inputs. This causes that screen to fluctuate a lot as the price moves so it is very hard to back test this method. Also, short entries signals often happen late with Dollie (I think it has to do with the ASH) so if you are comfortable with her system and see the ASH above the RSI and the CCI in between the two and the LSMA is Red and sloping down you can refer to other indicators and make your decision. When I entered the trade the ASH was above the zero line and that is very important to me. I guess it all comes down to interpration. Please see her thread if you have any other questions.

Hey GCTrader, I did exactly what you said below and I'm getting Syntax Error:This variable is not used in the code eriod Define variable:sample Again, I'm using IG Markets charts (IT Finance) thnx for the help.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hey Criss73, I had the same problem. In the code, change the second line to this: L=(lowest[period](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C In the script GCTrader gave last, period was actually SAMPLE. I changed it to period and that seemed to get rid of the error. Maybe ask GCTrader directly, as I'm still having problems adjusting the decimals on the MACD threshold. Jam

--- 帖子 #420 ---
thank you jam for your help. It works now but how do I make it look like a histogram with colors

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yes, its supposed to be period like in the picturebook. You can change the way your indicator looks by selecting chart type as histogram. Looks like its working tho! What a day yesterday! The system really showed us what its made of! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Any places that offers IT Finance charts will only give you two weeks trial. Try CMCMARKETS....

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Correct, the charting package I use comes with IGMarkets but they get them from prorealtime. This charting package from them is more comprehensive with sms alerts, mobile trading and years and years of data. But you do have to pay for that. The trial goes only for a week, but would give you a feel for it. Otherwise there are two brokers that use them, cmc and IGMarkets. I personally use IGMarkets and have had no problems. GCTrader

Hi Alesxish, You a great man... like GCTrader... we need to add one more thing to this indicator, will fetch it and post it now. Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I love it alexish haha, appreciated for sharing. One note going back to the .0056 value, wondering if you would consider changing it to a variable based on the low of last 132 as we discussed earlier since you will get substantially different entries, sometimes a difference of 1-3 bars and sometimes even false entries that you should not have been done. Give it some thought, but I love the progress so far and of course thanks for sharing this with everyone, will use this myself to live backtest more data...much easier with alerts :-) thanks!

I have been successful 8 of 11 tries using the pivot point squeeze. Takes discipline to not be too greedy with your limits, but, if you can achieve this discipline then this is a great system where you can be fairly tight with your stops!

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Tight stops is a bad idea, learnt through tears. Glad your making pips Joey! I missed it too Guess! Omar check out this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=399 This should set you straight GCTrader

--- 帖子 #433 ---
true, tight stops bad. We should all hbe more concerned with reward more than risk/reward!

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I think the thing with tight stops is a problem, besides the fake breakouts that retrace back to the range...often there's the 1,2,3 pattern with the breakout so if you have a tight stop even if you are up it often retraces to the higher/lower limit of the consolidation range and would close you out if you have a tight stop. I was just thinking of this today but on say 1HR frames if you only took entries after it bounces off the pivot the second time and starts shooting off your chances of winning increase. This is just my thought process from what I've learned from PA, for example my trade yesterday was a perfect example since I entered on the first bounce off the pivot, it retraced close to a couple pips to the pivot and bounced off again, I was lucky in this case since it didn't break the pivot and go the other way. Just some ideas to wonder about, I'm not sure how true this is and if this makes sense to anyone else but the longer I look at the charts the more I see heh, post if you have any ideas we can all improve on. But as for stops, the way I'm looking at it now is if I see any patterns then try to place the SL 10 pips away from it or so on the other side, still have to play around with the figures more just using what GCT suggested he uses so will try it for now. GCT just wondering, how much PA analysis do you use for predicting the trend on your tf before you enter a trade aside from pivots, because you don't always enter solely based on macd I believe, let me know if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Alexish, Thanks a lot for your hard work. I just try it and have couple of questions for you and as well as others. First of all look at my chart, and I was wondering if it is supposed too be. I cannot see MACD even though it is in the input section. Then my other question is how to interprent this chart. What do all colors mean? I guess I got confused.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I'm not sure but you're not supposed to see macd, this graph tells you where it's going... dark green bars under the "magical number" red, over the number, macd is - and decreasing blue, over the number, macd is + and increasing light green, over the number, but macd in opposite direction of macd trend or stalled let me know alexish if I'm wrong :-)

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Jonaslt, Thanks for explanation. I think It would be nice to be able to see MACD and bollinger bands/bandwidth. I think it gives more visibility. So if those are the cases like you explained, are we using entry and exit strategies as GCTrader expalined in his word document as follow? Entering a trade The first thing to look for is the narrowing of the Bollinger bands. When the Bollinger bandwidth crosses under the trigger line, you want to keep an eye out for a low on the histogram followed by an increase in bandwidth. This is a signal that it maybe breaking out and that is the entry point. Enter the market long if the MACD is trending up or short if it is trending down. Put more simply, trade in the way that the market is breaking away. When I enter a position, I enter a wide stop loss as the EUR/JPY can be volatile and go in the other direction before it trends in the predicted direction. Exiting a trade When the MACD histogram is starting to turn in the opposite direction of the trade with a certain threshold of this turn, it can signify an end to the rally. The threshold must be set at a level which is not too sensitive as to make you exit a longer profitable trade but not too lenient as to give much of your profits back. Experimenting with this level is the only way to know which is best for different pairs. Another way to plan your exits is to stage out at differing pivot levels. Say you enter a trade when it breaks down from the Pivot point. You would exit say half your lots at the 1st support line and then move your stop loss up to entry. Then your remaining lots at the 2nd support.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Absolutely correct! Thanks jonaslt! Use only one choice: The signal when the price hit up or down line of Bbands : BbandAlert = true; MACDAlert = false; The signal like said jonaslt (from MACD) : BbandAlert = false; MACDAlert = true; Tregger line is variable.. You can set other values if you whant...(optimize for other pairs)

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Good to know I had it right hehe, thanks again for all the coding. "Tregger line is variable", I know I can set them, but what I meant is according to Bollinger as GCT discussed earlier with bibls I believe (sry if I chopped your name up), the trigger line is based on the low of the last 132 bars, I wondered if it wouldn't be too hard to code that so it would change auto if you were up to it because then you could use this indicator on any pair and tf without changing the trigger line since it always changes according to the low. This would eliminate the need to always change the trigger on the same pair as well if it was passed under during the last 132 bars. I think I wrote it wrong the first time, what I meant by variable is changing by itself not a set variable thats modifiable. Sorry for the confusion

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes, what Alexish coded is exactly what GCT uses for entry at least, once the bandwidth increases from the minimum after a squeeze thats when we supposedly enter. One problem with the current Alexish's setup is that the level is a constant variable and does not set itself to the minimum it is supposed to be, so you have to set it manually to the lowest value of the last 132 bars (5.5 days if you're using H1) I brought this up earlier but there was some confusion with the wording :-)

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi, Many thanks to GCTrader1 for converting Mr Bollingers Theories into a system &amp; FXHermit for conversion to MT4. Having read Mr Bollingers book some years ago, it seems although you have the 'squeeze' method well and truly sorted . But i feel this is only 50% of what his system/your charting is capable of doing. You have come this far so why not go for the 100% system.This being the opposite to the squeeze. If you monitor your great charts you will notice that when the Bands significantly widen and then start to move towards each ofter,(which can be monitored via Bandwidth indicator) the market goes into trading range. This is then open for Range type trading methods. So using your charting bandwidth low = squeeze trading bandwidth high = range trading Your thoughts !!!! nightpipper (novice)

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Good call except for now I see at least one thing wrong or making it difficult to use at least. However, I agree, doing fast forward tests through historical data really brings this up as you often see the price retrace to the major trend and in the between stay usually between higher or lower part of the area between the bands. One problem I see is: your max bandwidth will change a lot so how will you determine if the breakout is over? Higher tf bollinger bandwidth might give you an idea when it's expanding contracting but you cant always tell how fast it can change so when you think a breakout is over it might just have a bigger pullback and then explode, or oppositely change trend direction. Not sure if what I said makes sense it's a bit late here again. I should probably get some sleep one of these days I went to sleep at 10am yesterday for 4-5 hours and been doing about the same for the past week including a couple all nighters...GCT your system and the mkt behind it is addicting haha

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Just throwing out another idea for everyone and GCT and Alexish if you feel up to it backtest wise. Especially during recent days most of the big breakouts were during or right before the London open, GCT what if you restricted the time when the signal would be valid, say a range of hours for example some before the open and half way into the day? This would exclude some range trading false signals that simply hit some new highs and usually retrace back into the range until those hours, or not to exclude too many trades if there are in fact a good number, wait for a second confirmation bar of bandwidth increase. Let me know what you think, this would be interesting to check using back tests see if it eliminates false entries and how many. Sorry guys directing this at you since I haven't started mt4 scripting...yet :-) Maybe between x-mas and new years while the market will still be unavail. more or less we'll see.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hey Nightpipper, Way ahead of ya mate, already started coding weeks ago but finding it alot more difficult to code a trading plan that is as profitable as the squeeze. The squeeze is a lot clearer than the reverse squeeze, or expansion. The problem with the bollinger band expansion is that while the bollinger band is a bell curve, it is a moving bell curve. So while the probability of the price closing at the edge of the bollinger band is low, during a trend it is higher. Its probability of snapping back to say the opposite band profitably and in a timely manner is inversely proportional to the time spent expanding. So quick snaps like a news event can trigger a a nice trade in the opposite direction of the initial spike from the news. Any ways, im tired, dont think im making any sense so catch you all tomorrow!

Just took some hours to go over the Bollinger On Bollinger book and must say for anyone trying this technique, it is definately worth a read to understand fully what is going on here and how to trade the breakout more effectively besides just using what's given here. GCTrader, just wondering if you tried any other indicators besides MACD for this, he names off a whole list, wondering if you tried any others in terms of effectiveness. I know the whole volume part cuts out since we don't have it but RSI etc.? Another idea I had was applying the bollinger bands to the ratio we get already as well as a separate indicator with RSI to see where it's oversold/overbought. Using these looking at the top of the range where it's oversold at the peak of the breakout and at what variable levels, we should have an idea where it will turn around, especially if we get a confirmation with a downsloping/upsloping RSI. This could be used to indicate the reversal of the breakout and go the other way until it consolidates more and goes into a ranging mode. Let me know if it makes sense, I want to try this on mt4 myself just have to get a little more savvy with the charts and will let you know if I come up with anything.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hmm, looking at the charts, now I'm thinking that theory is a little off. In this case, the reversal,continuation is when RSI is outside the bollinger bands and starts returning...this could actually be used as a exit strategy (opposite sloping RSI outside the BB on big breakouts) Still trying to see if bb applied to the ratio would give us any extra information.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Did someone say volume is out??? Volume we have, if you pay... http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/4...jpyspotso9.png Volume dropping off on the trade from friday, which is what you would expect leading up to the end of the week. It also could mean the movement is over. I exited before close of trade. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Do you use volume to identify fake outs at all before the breakout...is there any difference in the data on lower tf between the two? Huge spikes on low tf before a breakout as opposed to gradually increasing as the breakout goes or something like that. Thanks GCT

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Jon, There does seem to be a correlation between an increase of volume at a signal and fewer fake-outs. I have just wrote another code to include this volume and take it into account. Looking good so far, but as always, code can be a grind to perfect! Volume indicator seems to be worth the money. Let you know the results... Lower timeframes can enter you into a position sooner, but tends to yield more head-fakes. I have multiple timeframes up for the euroyen and aussie to keep an eye on the general, longer term squeeze and the shorter term entry. GCTrader

I think we might have a problem, but I'm not 100% on how you coded it, I tried looking at it, but on my graph the lowest was say .0034 but the limit is still .0043, don't think it got smoother or anything, maybe look low of different tf or something? No clue. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Looks right, what TF are you using? I use a 38 sample period. Seems to work the best even when I take it back 3 years! GCT

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Isn't it supposed to be always at a minimum point of the last 132 bars? If it's through the hourly in my case shouldn't the threshold be .0034 since that's one of the ratios on Dec. 19th? Jonas

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Trigger Line = minimum of Bband in period of 132 bar (default variable TriggerCountBar = 132) + TriggerLevel (dafault TriggerLevel = 0.001) So.. if minimum Bband is 0.0034 then Trigger Line must be 0.0044..

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Quote by Bolliinger "However,some short-term traders may want to shorten the average a bit,say to 15 periods,and tighten the bands a bit,say to 1.5 standard deviations. There is one other parameter that can be set,the look-back period for the Squeeze. The longer you set the look-back period— recall that the default is six months—the greater the compression you’ll achieve and the more explosive the setups will be. However, there will be fewer of them. There is always a price to pay it seems." This meaning there is no set standard, customization is part of developing a trading plan for how you trade. The longer the trigger look back period the fewer the trades, but some very nice and extremely profitable trades are lost. GCT

Hi GCTrader, The variables I have for the squeeze are MACD Threshold 2, Trigger Float 0.0003, and period 38. Yet on your chart it looks likethey are 3, 0.0006, and 38 respectively. Should the settings be changed or is there a way to have them auto-update as now is the case in the Trigger indicator? Thanks, Jam

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I would really appreciate a pdf with code defined. I use the premiere trade platform and the pivot point graphs are different looking than yours(much less detailed but still the same). Also, I usually don't trade below the 180 min charts. Most examples of your charts are 1hr. Does all the same rules apply on 180 min vs 1hr charts? I really appreciate GCT"s input as well as everyone else. Happy pipadays to everyone! JoeyBiasatti

Mine got in a bar earlier on the first one(the short) and for the long it got in as it broke through the pivot point. What settings do you have your BB on?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Indicators are never perfect, user discretion always should come into it to a degree. That is why auto trading programs rarely work well. I use the indicator to help me with my entries and exits, although it does a damn good job of picking those entries. The only thing against this being sublime is head-fakes. These ruin lives! Not really but it does suck. There is no way of fully ridding the system of these. This BB break out has been worked on since bollinger( ) came up with these ingenious bands. I have just combined them with breakouts from pivot points. I have noticed both for some time and just started coding it. So glad I did as like many other people following this thread, I have been making regular profits instead of yo-yoing up and down. I hope over the last month I have enlightened people of these occurrences and have profited from them. Take care and I wish you all a merry Christmas and an awesome New year! Brent

Poor mans Volume chart. Apply code to tick by tick chart. It updates every hour which can be changed. It counts the displays the ticks. Keep it in the background somewhere and you will know when the volume is dropping. It is relative volume not absolute as we all know its impossible. Closest thing to it tho. Hope it helps! GCT if close&gt;close[1] or close&lt;close[1] then tick=tick+1 endif if Minute=0 then tick=0 endif tick1=tick if Minute&lt;&gt;59 then tick1=0 endif if minute=59 then ret=tick1 endif return ret

Hi! Would you mind to post a template and the MT4 indicators needed? THX

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I am using 18, same as you, though I think your trigger is different to mine. I will have a look at this. The other thing I was thinking off... why not use like a Martingale System here, i.e if you get stopped out then reverse and go in the opposite direction, though with keeping a tight SL and TP you should be onto a winner... if you get head fakes, as either way it goes you will win as it will breakout one way or another. What do you think? I can speak with Alexish and he can write an EA for this exact use. Thanks, Guess

hi, its looking interesting n waiting for your PDF.

I think its an good idea. We could use fxtraderspro semimartinalepositionsize for this. Have a merry Christmas everyone!

Hey Guess, Martingle position sizing is definitely not the way I want to trade, I cant imagine any serious trader that wants to make a living off trading doing this. Not to discount it but there is no way I would do this. Even in the gambling world where this was made for, it is not now used since it leads to gambling ruin. If I get stopped out of a trade, so be it. If my system wants to enter me in again in the opposite way due to still being under the trigger but it starts breaking up, I go in again. I dont want to "make up" for my previous trades in this trade. The psychology warfare behind this strategy must be unreal! Its bad enough as it is without adding pressure of having to increase your position sizing way beyond you means and watching that go down to a very low SL while knowing that if you get stopped out again, you have to double up again. My advice is to stay away from such lunacy, but that is just my opinion. Hope everyone is having great holidays! GCTrader

Hey... Hello guys! Just going to through something into the thread in a second... hope you can stay online. Guess.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hey... Alexish... That's great! Excellent! Thanks very much for all you have done! I wanted to ask you and GCTrader. Are we using the bandwidth level as our squeeze indicator, i.e if we get below the bandwidth threshold, it is squeezing? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Correct, The BBW is a quantative way of giving the trigger a level to which we can say it has squeezed enough. The BB on the chart visually show us how much of a squeeze it is and also is it returning from a previous big move as the butterfly is a very profitable BB pattern(I made that name up, seems appropriate tho ;-) First post of this thread shows one of them. Hope that helps Guess, GCT

Hi alexi, i am using the Bnds_squueze_v5 but it seems that the TP level wont appear, any settings that i need to tune? thanks to GCtrader for this great system and also alexi for the coding.Some questions here, hope you guys can help: 1. When the Bands_squueze_v5 indicator is in dark green, it means that the bollinger band is squeezing and we are ready for a setup? 2.When the Bands_squueze_v5 indicator turns from dark green to blue or red and pass thgough the red line(trigger line?) we open positon accordingly? blue=long, red = short? 3. High probablity trade happen when all the condition met and the price break thgorugh the pivot point? thanks in advance

Hi, Is it possible to have an alert programmed to the system ? for when when the Dark green 'squeeze' condition lines touch the the variable 'trigger' line ? (or could someone advise where i can learn to do these smaller programming duties) thanks nightpipper

But isn't it already there? I mean, I get long/short alerts when price gets out of squeeze. Note also variable AlertTrade in indicator properties.

Euroyen Volume information and chart can be viewed at http://www.fxstreet.com/futures/currency-futures-charts/?id=F2:RY\H08.cm This is done by viewing the volume of currency futures being traded. The correlation between futures and spot is extremely close. The chart can be undocked from the window and placed near your other graphs. Quite a help! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Great info GCT! Thanks once again. Just a quick question in terms of execution of your preference, after the bandwidth ratio falls bellow a certain level that you would trade a breakout after, do you place your trade after any increase in bandwidth say .0004 to .00041 on the close of the next candle, no matter where your level is or do you wait until the ratio goes back up to your "level" and breaks it with in increase? Also, how often do you place these trades before the candle closes and you definitely see a solid increase in bandwidth say if you see a classic PA formation. Seems the more I try to analyze this and try to perfect it, my results on live backtests decrease haha.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hi GCTrader, Hope you had a great Christmas! I took the EUR trade, but chicken out... I keep doing this, I get mad with myself... grrr... but I am going to pulll the trigger and leave it and let it do it's business next time! Thanks, Guess

Alexish/Jon, I think we need to get this IG code coded on MT4, this will give us the signal, dunno what you guys think. As GCTrader uses this to give the thumbs up.

Hey Jonas, As soon as the BBW increases once it has crossed under the trigger line it signals a trade. Normally it takes a while before it bottoms out under the trigger level. I wait for the candle to close before entry as sometimes it wavers between entry and no entry. Time has taught me some good lessons! Hope you had a great Christmas, still got new years to go yet! GCT

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hey mate, had a great Christmas. You? That trade on the euroyen was a borderline since it wasnt breaking through the pivot point but still looked like a valid trade. We all do that champ, so wouldnt sweat it! I have done the same thing only to watch it pump out a crazy amount of pips. Thing is, as long as you learn from it and you arent losing too much money it will make you a better trader in the long run! Next week is a new week! GCT

Alexish, Could you please explain some inputs in your EA, the main ones: BBPeriod=20 ( is it supposed to be 18?) TriggerLevel= 0.001 ( is it right value?) TriggerCountBar=38 ( is it supposed to be 132 in H1?) AutoDayTargets ( How does it work?) BackTest= 1 ( How does it work?) Additionally, can't we get all pivots and TPs all together in one chart? ( it seems like one surpass the other) Are you also planning to add those to the EA as originally given by GCTrader1 Pivot Deviation Distance from a pivot point in which the signal is still valid 14 MACD Threshold Threshold of the deviation of the MACD that signals an exit 6.2 I also look forward to everyone's feedback on those questions

General Question to MT4 users: Are using "Bands_Squeeze_v5.mq4" alone or with some other indicators that Fxhermit posted before ("BB_Squeeze_Advanced_v2demark.mq4", "bbhistotest2.mq4"? I have seen some post that has charts with all indicators in place. My understanding is "Bands_Squeeze_v5.mq4" should take care of everything and just would like to confirm that

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I have the same question. Is there any indicator like an arrow that corresponds to GCTrader1's green bar buy signal? Still not exactly sure about the buy/sell signals on the mt4 platform. thanks Rob

So, same period in 15 min chart. It is definitely more clear here. So should we trade 15 min chart for this system? Is it going to creat more false signals?

Hi Eastcity, I have tried to compile this and it comes up with errors. Can put this into a file that has already been compiled? Thanks, Guess

--- 帖子 #523 ---
The indicator drawn by Alexish is stunningly beautiful and it is a great "heads up." However, there is more to it than simply looking at the indicator. I noticed that you don't have any BBs which you need to be on the lookout for your trade. Remember, you are looking for that "squeeze". You can make a template of a more simple looking chart after you find your squeeze. Also, remember the "heads-up" that is in the instruction is that you are looking for a Pivot Point. The last PP on the EURJPY chart in question was 165.49 which gave you a sell signal way back and you would be positive over 200 PIPs at this time. I looked at the 30 minute chart which is the same as the 1 hour chart for half the time. There you will see that the band bars have dipped underneath the line. You can take a signal on the 30, knowing that it is the same as the 60 for half the time. When those dark green bars are continuing to "squeeze" lower you are still watching. When you finally get a bar that is even slightly higher then you are able to put an entry order in so that you will be swept into the trade. As for confirming direction, I have a number of ways to figure it out and primarily I am using the PSAR which, if you put it on the chart with the default settings that MT4 gives you, immediately indicates direction and can give you a slightly earlier "heads up" for your entry order. The higher time frames are more reliable. (Caution: the smaller the timeframe, the more twists and turns; I like to look at the 4H chart for ultimate direction and trend and also to position in to the trade, not to merely scalp 20 or 30 PIPs). We can get beaucoup PIPs with this system but we have to exercise a little creativity and tweaking. This system, however, as far as I can tell so far, usually tells us the truth about break-out and direction. Most joyful New Year to all here! PS My comments are to post 520 FX97. Thanks

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi GCT ... I didn't realise you were in Australia too. I'm the guy MACDoug spoke about and am finally starting some PRT programming of your system and indicators, along with some enhancements hopefully (from my prior PRT systems). Could you please drop me a private message with your eMail address? Best regards, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
In other words, before entering a trade we need to ascertain if the current price is above or below the pivot point then make either a long or sell order, but check the 4H trend first. Am I correct in saying that? I have all the things set up but do not know how to interpret the band squeeze v5 until your message came. They mentioned the trigger but I don't see any trigger. Now I just need to concentrate on the dark green bar and once it gets higher that's the signal to enter (subject to confirmation in 4H trend). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
One more question, is the trigger value set at 0.001 for all currency pairs in the band squeeze v5? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
The trigger level should not be set at any arbitrary level. It should be set by recent lows in the BBW. Alexish, have you written this into the MT4 code? The prorealtime chart indicator I wrote has included this and has made it much more reliable on all time frames and pairs. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hi FX97, It can be traded on other time frames for sure but you must remember that the lower the time frame, the higher the probability of a head-fake. I have 2 pairs up, euroyen and aussie. I have 1 day, 1 hour, 30 min, 15 min and 10 min charts up for both... lucky I have 4 monitors. I am about to get my 5th 37" to free up more space. Just like Elliott Wave Theory where you have waves within waves, you have squeezes within squeezes. These can be however, a precursor to a squeeze in a higher timeframe. The ones that are signaling an entry at a lower time-frame are a heads up to keep an eye on the higher time frames which are more reliable. Thats not to say that the lower timeframes are not trade-able, which I do, but are more prone to false signals, or head-fakes. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi Joyrider, I am not trying to re-write this system; it is great. Remember from Post # 1: "It is a pivot point system that takes into account constricted activity around these points and helps you reach a conclusion as to trade or not" GCT1 has an indicator on his charts that we don't have as of yet and it is the one called "position" that turns red or blue. Ok, so we wait for a visual squeeze on the Bollinger Bands and also notice that the band indicator has dark green vertical columns that have gone under the red trigger line. Each of those little green vertical columns has a number if you put your cursor on top of them and they are increasing, decreasing or staying equal. When they continue to decrease they are squeezing. When you see the next column under the trigger that increases even a little bit you have a signal that a breakout is coming. If you wait for the red or blue bar confirmation you will enter very late and miss alot of PIPs. Also, remember that GCT1 says that you should have this on the chart: "MA periods: 18 Standard deviation: 2" For direction you can put on the PSAR from your MT4 indicator list or you can search for "FXSniper MA" indicator on the FF site and make your MA18 an FXSniper MA line that will change color and give you buy/sell direction. The point is that you need to know which way to go after you get your signal. In the absence of that very nice "position" indicator that GCT1 has, there are ways to put in an entry order with confidence. Best to you....

Hey GCTrader1, Hope you had a wonderful Christmas and New Year I resubscribed to ProRealTime. I'm using the most recent numbers from the .doc file for the backtest. It takes a heck of a long time to optimize, and then I end up with no signals at all on 3 mos. worth of 1 hour data. Below is the programming, taken directly from the .doc file: trigger = undefined rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth(with number of periods equal to B) has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line(L) and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close))))&gt;=A then trigger = 0 endif rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close)))&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))) then trigger =-1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then trigger = 0 endif PP = (DHIGH(1) +DCLOSE(1) + DLOW(1))/3 rtwo=(pP+dhigh(1)-dlow(1)) rone=(pP*2)-dlow(1) sone=(pP*2)-dhigh(1) stwo=pP-dhigh(1)+dlow(1) rem P is the pivot point deviation PIVOT = P if TRIGGER = 1 and ((medianprice&lt;(PP + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(PP - PIVOT)) OR (medianprice&lt;(SONE + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(SONE - PIVOT)) OR (medianprice&lt;(STWO + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(STWO - PIVOT))) THEN BUY 1 SHARES AT MARKET REALTIME ENDIF IF TRIGGER = 0 THEN SELL 1 SHARES AT MARKET ENDIF if TRIGGER = -1 and ((medianprice&lt;(PP + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(PP - PIVOT)) OR (medianprice&lt;(RONE + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(RONE - PIVOT)) OR (medianprice&lt;(RTWO + PIVOT) AND medianprice&gt;(RTWO - PIVOT))) THEN SELLSHORT 1 SHARES AT MARKET REALTIME ENDIF IF TRIGGER = 0 THEN EXITSHORT 1 SHARES AT MARKET ENDIF Variables: P PIVOT DEVIATION MIN 0 MAX 40 STEP 1 L TRIGGER MIN 0.003 MAX 0.008 STEP 0.0001 B BOLLINGER BANDWIDTH MIN 17 MAX 27 STEP 1 A MACD THRESHOLD MIN 3 MAX 9 STEP 0.1 Any suggestions I recall you saying something about ProRealTime the MACD numbers having to be multiplied by 100. Can you confirm or clarify? Also, can you clarify the variable settings in terms of being &gt;0, &gt;=0, or No restriction on each? All the best, Jam

--- 帖子 #531 ---
0.001 is not trigger value. It is used as a "figure" to be added to the smallest bar from recent history. That way, we get our trigger line.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Just a clarification sought ... for entry does the squeeze histogram indicator need to physically break from below the trigger line to above the trigger line, or simply be below the trigger line and start to increase from a minimum (ie. entering the trade before the histogram crosses back above the trigger line)? Thanks, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Joyrider / Scarlett. Re: Direction of move. These are already programmed onto your indicator. Blue bars = go long Red bars = go short Thanks to the great programmers !!!!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Does it look like there may be a signal on the AUDUSD??? It looks that way to me... The only thing is that we haven't really had a squeeze for very long (and that big pin bar a couple of hours ago is sort of weird). But it is a squeeze.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Not even close The reading is sitting at 0.008 atm which is fairly high. It did dip down to 0.0049 but the trigger level is sitting at 0.0032 so no trade for now. You have to remember not to force the trades as they will let you know who is boss soon enough! GCTrader

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hey Johnny, The entry is signaled when the BBW has gone below the trigger level and then reverses and starts to increase. This indicates that the squeeze is over and the expansion is well under way. It is irrelevent if the current bar of the BBW is under or over the trigger line, only that a previous bar has penetrated the trigger level and closed beneath it. I will get around to replying to your email btw, its just it is so long it will take me a while to answer it all. lol GCTrader

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Thanks for the reply, GCTrader. I suppose I am not quite sure why the Metatrader version of your system has the trigger level listed as 0.0085. In fact, the last time the trigger level on my chart was near 0.0032 was on Decemer 24th, when it was 0.0038, but then the trigger level jumped up. I suppose the low that the Metatrader indicator does not go back as far as your indicator in determining the trigger level? [I know this has been discussed a lot on this thread...but it appears to be the case here.]

--- 帖子 #538 ---
These charts may best illustrate what I see on the Metatrader indicator.... hmmm.....

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi Scarlett, Clear explanation. I had made a mistake earlier when the BB alert came and immediately I placed a sell order for gj but had to close it out later when it was -50+ pips. It was the blue bar when I entered. Now I know I have to check the squeeze level in the dark green bar b4 doing anything. I have the slope direction line that has a buy/sell signal which I just got from another thread. I should be fine now. Thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
guess 121, Sorry for delay because of New Year, I had hoped that someone more skilled in mq4 programming than myself could take over and process it further. If noone does let me try to return with a compile-able script, it might take me a couple of days. regards Ola

Hmmm, interesting. As this is what I see and there is no trade evident. The BBW did not get down low enough to be a valid signal.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
hi eastcity, no probs... happy new year to you all... no rush, that time of year, I'll see if Alexish is around and drop him a line. thanks, guess

Jamdragon888 I am trying to get the squeeze indicator to work on CMC Marketmaker a variant of Pro realtime and noticed you also seemed to be doing the same? How are you doing with the coding? David

--- 帖子 #544 ---
David, Copy and paste code from this post and it should work fine! CMC req. a slight change in code. GCT http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=405

--- 帖子 #545 ---
And this is why I keep differing time periods open. As said previous, 15min charts work very well alongside the 1 hour. A very nice trade and 1 very happy camper! It broke through the pivot and signaled a textbook trade. GCT

--- 帖子 #546 ---
HI GCT1 - happy new year to you and to the others on the thread! Glad to see you are prospering with the system. I am looking forward to catching up with the evolution of the thread. Cheers, IB

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Divad, Below is the code I had on CMC. I switched to ProRealtime, but I'm waiting for some assistance from GCTrader on that one. Cheers, Jam b=18 L=(lowest[period](BollingerBandWidth[18](close)))+C rem This is the buy setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending up. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close))*100)&gt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))*100) then trigger = 1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])*100))) - (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)*100)))&gt;=A then trigger = 0 endif rem This is the short sell setup which detects when the bollinger bandwidth has made a new low followed by an increase in bandwidth below the trigger line and the MACD is trending down. if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 and BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1])&lt;L and round((MACDline[5,13,1](close))*100)&lt;round((MACDline[5,13,1](close[1]))*100) then trigger = -1 endif rem This is the exit setup which detects a turnaround in the MACD histogram. The turnaround threshold is determined by A if (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])*100))) - (abs(round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)*100)))&gt;=A then trigger = 0 endif return trigger

Thanks Scarlett

Thanks got it...

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Jamdragon888 Thanks for code but Tried both sets of code for sqeeze still the same blank indicator no matter what settings also same as your self trigger float will not go lower than 0.001 whether this makes a difference? What timeframes and settings have you got it to work on? Thanks for your help Divad

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi CGT, Thanks for your reply re the entry clarification (and I look forward to the other when you have the chance, thanks). Back in post #306, you posted this chart ... I'm wondering why the LONG trade didn't show an entry indication about 4 bars earlier, when the histogram first started to increase (and this was why I'd questioned whether it had to re-cross the trigger line)? Is it possible that the histogram increase 4 bars earlier was less than .0001, so it wasn't a 'true' for the coding statement to show an entry indication? Thanks, Johnny. http://img208.imageshack.us/img208/9...xgbpjpyak9.png

--- 帖子 #552 ---
This trade worked out well even though it may not have been strictly according to the rules. I thought it was worth a shot since the squeeze alert sounded and the price had bounced off the weekly pivot (green horizontal line). Interesting how it dropped and bounced from the monthly pivot. (blue horizontal line). It was an unpopular trade around here though since it was 1:00 a.m. when the alert sounded and I had my laptop on my night stand and my wife gets up at 6:00 for work... Just checking to see how the alert would work...seems fine. Cheers

--- 帖子 #553 ---
What settings are you using on the sqeeze5 indicator ?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Hi, My settings are the standard ones except I set the bands to 18,2 and turn off the pivots.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hey Johnny, Yes, sometimes on the BBW it looks like an increase but it isnt quite enough to signal a trade. I look forward to your input with coding issues and improvements. GCT

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hey Divad, I have heard that problem as well from other users of cmc. The code should be able to be modified to accommodate this restriction. I will work on it later and post it to you. GCT

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi GCT, I note in 2 versions of this code you have L=(lowest[ period ] or L=(lowest[ SAMPLE ] ... I'm presuming the 'period' or 'SAMPLE' should actually be replaced with a figure, or an assigned variable, but I cannot locate either. Can you please advise, thanks - Johnny.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
They aren't a set value, that is a variable which you enter into the variables column on the top right to which you can put a default value such as 38. GCT

--- 帖子 #559 ---
No trades atm on the PPS. BBW on the 1H is still at 0.0113 GCT

--- 帖子 #560 ---
A trade on the Aussie is developing on the 15min chart. If it breaks above the PP, the entry signal given would be a solid one especially given the current BBW level of 0.0015. Going long would also be in the direction of the interest rate differential. The 1H however is still at 0.0046 with the trigger level at 0.0032 so some consolidation around this level is a high probability. GCT

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks GCT, Couple of questions here: 1) Any mechanical reason why you would not have taken that LONG trade earlier at about 23:30? I know it was just shy of the PP, but that would have been a discretionary 'no trade'. I'm presuming that by the rules this would have been a normal system trade entry, with no profit taken - ie. stopped out probably around 00:45? 2) What is the programming logic behind the number of bars that the trade entry indicator remains valid? Sometimes the indicator will show for only a couple of bars (such as in the above example), sometimes for many more bars. Is it simply that the histogram needs to be below the trigger and while ever the histogram bars are increasing, the trade entry indicator will continue to show (ie. paint more bars) ... or is there something deeper I've missed in the code? P.S. Looking forward to the package (re my eMail) , as I don't think it's wise that I start 'in depth' until I'm sure I'm right up to date and have the correct 'logical' understanding.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I was thinking the same thing. It wasn't shy of the PP, it pierced it. Looks like a clear buy signal given the system rules. Excellent system overall though, quite similar to my own style of trading. GCT, have you backtested it on Prorealtime beyond 3 months? (for the hourly E/J setup)

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hey Johnny, 1) The reason i didnt take the trade earlier was that I was well intoxicated up in Brisbane chasing tail, but if I wasnt getting any action and i didnt have a gorgeous brunette(i better not post those photos ) lying next to me, then yes I would have taken that trade for sure and probably exited for no profit. 2) When an entry is signaled it stays in the trade until the MACD has turned back on its original direction by a certain amount which is determined by the MACD threshold in the variable column in the code. Hope this helps, GCT

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Ah - couple of things just clicked why some members may be having trouble getting the indicator to work correctly ... it could perhaps be due to confusion. I see you've got 'trigger' defined twice, for 2 different purposes. In the SQUEEZE indicator, you do a 'return trigger' (in this case it's the trade entry trigger indicator). Then you have another indicator called TRIGGER, which is probably more accurately defined as the 'trigger line' rather just the trigger. Although it may now create further confusion if you made any code label changes, may I suggest that in the SQUEEZE indicator, you call the indicator returned for display as 'trade entry'? ... and in the TRIGGER indicator you call it the 'trigger line'? Just some thoughts as to where an opportunity exists for confusion . Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Very true Johnny, a little confusing. I will change it in my updated pdf. By the way, check out the new tick distribution charts! Have to make a system based on this beauty now! Any ideas Johnny? There insane! Check them out yourself from... http://www.prorealtime.com/common/pa...ge=EN&amp;from=GCT Let me know what u think but im sure we can make another solid system off this extra information. Im in love...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
And a close up

--- 帖子 #567 ---
How to understand these tick distribution or market profile: Tick distribution uses intraday data and thus only work in intraday view. The most important parameters are box height and box width. Generally, you use a daily view with tick distribution and a "box width" of 30 minutes. ABOUT THE INFORMATION ON THE GRAPH : The GREEN arrow is the opening price. The first prices generated during the first (box width) minutes are labelled by boxes called "A" in the first column. An initial box with height (box height) is created at the opening price. If price goes outside the first box, a new box is created above or below the first one. For the first (box width) minutes (usually 30), the boxes will be labelled A. After that, they will be labelled B. and placed in the column to the right of the first one. If there is price action in a box where there was also price action in the first 30 minutes, the B box will be placed to the right of the A box. If there is price action in B where there was none in A (above or below for example), the B box will be slid to the left so that it is in the same column as the a boxes either above or below them. The BLUE arrow is the last (current) price (shown to the right of the boxes). The RED arrow is the price which has the most "boxes" to the right of it. The thick RED LINE represents 70% of the ticks centered on the red zone - I believe this would be the zone of control. The thick BLUE LINE represents the prices during the first 2 phases (A and B). Or for an indepth video presentation go to: http://www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/marketi...on/Anatomy.htm put aside 30 minutes tho.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks KGB, hope your doing well with it! I will have to set it up on the backtest instead of an indicator with all the new code. Will let you know the results. GCT

--- 帖子 #569 ---
The attached indicators are similar

Is the trigger level different for different pairs ? and the trigger count bar ?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
See this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=531 In return, can you describe (even though we are on GCtrader's thread) how to interpret those last two indicators you attached ? (if possible with some screenshots). thanks

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I posted the market profile indicators because it related to the other post but i have not found a way to use them

--- 帖子 #573 ---
For those members finding they are getting a flat line on the trade entry/exit trgger indicator with any curreny pair other than EUR/JPY, it is because the JPY pairs are expressed in 2 decimal places, whilst all other pairs are expressed as 4 decimal places. This means that if you are using PRT or MarketMaker, with a pair that trades as 4 decimal places (ie. not involving JPY), then all MACD references in the code will need to be x 10000 instead of x 100). I already have code that automatically detects the decimal value of the currency pair and automatically adjusts for this, but I have written it for another system, and am yet to pull it across to try and incorporate it into CGT's system - but as CGT will tell you, these things are on the drawing board. Hope this helps out, cheers - Johnny.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
GCT Trader is Banned ? ?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hey Johnny, Nice picking up on why that code wont work. You use pro realtime or CMC markets or IGMarkets? That might be a clue as to why the code has to be modified again! I wish they could just use one value system. And again, your email is coming John! Tomorrow! I went up in a helicopter to see the damage of the floods here, unbelievable! It looked like an ocean out there! Also took pics of the big day out from 500 feet. Funny as when we landed in a sports oval and ran to the toilet block in some little town that was flooded in! Should have seen them all come running out to see us! lol At least someone thought of one way to make use of the floods! lol John has made a few improvements to the code which should help with PRT users and hopefully CMC users. Let me know if it doesnt and I shall look into it. Cheers for your help John. Best Regards, Dynami

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Can I just say to those wot are in charge, GCT's contribution on this thread has been massive and very generous, and I would humbly request that you can come to an accommodation if possible. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
what did he get banned for?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I believe it is a 2 week suspension due to posting a commerical link ... but also no doubt a very innocent mistake by GCT I'm sure. Hopefully, some leniancy will prevail here from the powers to be, as although this is one of the most professional forums I belong to, some tolerance or advance warning should apply when a member either intentionally or unintentionally does something against the rules. This is an excellent thread and an excellent system with very good profit potential for us all, so hopefully development will continue. Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
posting a commercial link?? ack...I may be guilty of that - what does that mean exactly? I was trying to help someone better understand something and I referred to a video on another website. I have to assume commercial links would be more like a sales/spam type post?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
This is just a hunch, but I think it was because he posted referral links. You could tell by the way the link included "partner.phtml....=GCT" meaning he might have been paid for anyone who clicked the link. If my hunch is correct, I don't see why the mods don't just remove the links and give him a warning. A ban seems a bit excessive.. He's obviously been very generous &amp; helpful with all of the info and support he's shown, FF needs more members like him! **** Now onto GCT's interesting system, I setup a demo on IG to test it out. All settings were entered exactly as described in his original writeup. Since someone pointed out earlier the bug in the coding for 4-digit decimal pairs, I only ran the backtests on yen crosses (E/J, G/J, U/J, N/J, A/J, CAD/J). They all came out positive except for aud &amp; cad, although in retrospect, I realize that the bollinger bandwidth parameter is tuned for EUR/JPY and should be configured differently for each pair. Even with accounting for the lack of fine tuning by pair, the out performance of EUR/JPY was eye opening. 11 trades, all winners, resulting in a near doubling of the account in 3 months (with no compounding!). The 1H time frame is by far the most optimum, dropping down to 30M cut the gain in half, 10-15M were breakeven, anything below that resulted in a loss over the period. The average time between trades was 127 trading hours (~5 1/2 trading days). Still, for 100% accuracy over a 3-month period, that's well worth the wait. Once I get the other pairs fine-tuned with regards to bandwidth settings, I may have to demo PRT myself to see how the backtests stand up using several years worth of 1H data. Thanks again GCT for sharing your system. I hope your situation can be rectified amicably so that you may join us here once again! (and I want to hear more about that brunette )

--- 帖子 #581 ---
here it goes

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Looks like you just have the backtest code working but still need to add the 12 BBands and the pivots. It's unfortunate this charting system doesn't allow any type of template exporting, a very basic feature of any other charting app. Otherwise, I could just post my template file for you to import. I think our best bet is to get this fully integrated into MT4. I'll look into what others have already done in the previous pages and see what I can do.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Looks like we're about to get a signal on EUR/JPY. Price has been sitting on the central pivot since the market opened, bandwidth has dropped to .0058, and it's been 6 1/2 days since the last trade signal.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Long trade entry signal given at 160.68..

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hey TraderKGB- I dont see the long signal on my Metatrader indicator (Bands Squeeze v5). I wonder if this is another case of evidence supporting that the Metatrader indicator doesn't quite duplicate the IT finance charts...hmm.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hi all, A trade was signaled as KGB pointed out. Since then it has just traveled sideways showing no sign of a trend as of yet. I still hold at an entry of 16065 although as being monday, generally a non-trending day, a minimum of lots were used. 1st tp is at 16100, just below the 1R and 2nd tp at 16200(just below the 2R) When a signal is given on tuesday through to friday, it generally has more weight given to the signal due to higher volume and more traders "sitting on the fence". Now it is up to the pip gods. My best to those in...

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I got a sell arrow on my chart. Did you get the arrow to go long?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I was waiting out on this one but decided not to go in this morning. I looked at the 4HR and we are going into a squeeze and I think today might just be a full sideways day especially with no big news and the breakout start seemed too be too early before the London open. Not sure if my reasoning is right but it worked this time heh. edit: talking about the earlier buy signal not the sell which occurred later I believe

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Yes long arrow. It looks like your pivots are off. Make sure you aren't showing weekend data (it's in the chart properties somewhere).

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Yeah I noticed that too. My other system was indicating a sell still on EUR/JPY so I didn't enter at all. Will be interesting to see how this one plays out (although it's -45 pips now, so I probably would've exited had I bought on the signal).

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I have downloaded all of the indicators for the MT4 that have been coded on this squeeze system and don't have one that gives arrows or any audible alert. Which indicator are you talking about? Since I am not a coder I don't know how to modify the existing indicators when yall change them. Is there one up to date indicator or template for MT4 that we can all use? Thanks in advance for the help...

--- 帖子 #592 ---
The indicators (and optional audio alert) I was referring to in that post are on the IT-Finance charts via way of an IG-markets demo account.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
The BB squeeze indicator version 5 by alexish gives arrows and audible alerts it's somewhere in the couple previous pages.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I have two different charts here with the same code with different data.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Something is definitely wrong with your settings, what parameters are you using for the squeeze?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
It's because of your pivots in the second chart, something is definitely wrong with those pivot calcs.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
It is still staying in the trades way too long, even after a substantial reversal. This should not be the case

--- 帖子 #598 ---
True, there was a 70 pip drawdown on this most recent signal. Sure, it's turned around and gone positive since, but who's going to hang on to -70? The stop loss parameters need to be fine tuned a bit.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi to all Still having some problems using CMC so gone back to Metatrader is there a description of the system for metatrader it seems to show ok but I am not sure of settings. I notice from posted charts everyone is using the system on hourly charts is there any reason it will not give good results on shorter say 15min or longer timeframes? Thanks for your help. Is there any one else on this forum from UK? Divad

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Did anyone see and get in the latest trade? It has been over now for 3 hours but it was one hell of a nice trade!

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Exactly, I was stopped out on the long trade. As said previous, I never use my usual allotment on mondays as this is a naturally non-trending day. It does give nice trades sometimes, but backtesting has shown it to yield more head-fakes and trendless trading ranges. The second trade was given while I was asleep(Australian times ) but for the previous reason, I had no desire to enter again. I really have to figure out how to have sms alerts for this system!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Wow hope someone caught the nice squeeze 14gmt today on the EJ 70 pip down move in less than an hour with a really nice squeeze. Kicking myself I had to leave for an hour when I was up all night waiting for something haha

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thats what Im talking about Jonas, need those damn sms alerts hey! PRT has sms alerts but only on their indicators, not custom ones. They are working on it atm and will email me when this is done. IGMarkets don't have them either. I believe GFT may have them tho...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I think you're using different code than mine. Did GCT supplement the code beyond what he put in that original Word doc from page 1? I still only have that one trade from early Sunday, exited yesterday for break even.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Great system. On the first charts of this thread, there were 2 indicators named "equity curve" and "positions". Is it possible to obtain them separately in mq4 ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Euroyen is down to a 0.0033 atm. Below the trigger line and could signal a nice entry. Keep an eye on this one! It has been in a range from 16000 to 16150 for the last 5 trading days. It is currently sitting on the pivot point and having trouble breaking below today. My alarms are sitting and waiting!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
ya, i still keep on see the chart.... can post here when it it a entry?/ thank you it will be a nice trade

--- 帖子 #608 ---
When my alarms sound, I will post as well.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
look like it is a sell

--- 帖子 #610 ---
it hasn't signaled yet on the hourly although on the 10 and 15min a sell has been signaled although they can sometimes be unreliable.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Jean Claude Trichet is speaking atm on the economy so it could go either way. The hourly would be a safer bet or the shorter time frames which already signal an entry can sometimes give rise to a signal in the 1 hour chart a bit earlier albeit riskier.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Once the pivot is broken, if the hourly hasn't given a signal, it can't give a signal later on. It must be generated on a pivot break (at least according to GCT's original rule set).

--- 帖子 #614 ---
H1 not confirm wait.... i will wait thanks for your post

--- 帖子 #615 ---
If it also goes below 16000, get ready for a ride. It has been a support line since the 22nd of oct. Have been dancing off it for the last five days, testing it...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
True, it must signal within a certain range of the pivot points. That was the original Pivot point deviation value given in the code. If I remember correctly, it was optimized to be about 14 pips from the pivot points. The chart has just signaled a short although the candle has not closed yet. If it goes back up, the BBW could decrease again. As always, do your own analysis to make your own conclusion.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
i am in the trade 160.83 hope close in profit

--- 帖子 #618 ---
What stop distance are you using? It should be atleast 16108 to give it room to bounce off the pivot point if it heads back up there.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
1st TP is at 16030 unless signaled an exit using the MACD turnaround method. Hope it keeps going our way!

--- 帖子 #620 ---
i use R1 for stop...... safe from sl, floating...... tp will be S1......

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Never received a sell signal on my end, in fact I'm showing a buy signal. These are GCT's original settings. I would recommend everyone confirm &amp; backtest before trading live. dynami - Are you sure you're using GCT's original code (from the Word doc on page 1)? We really shouldn't be getting opposite signals..

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Depending on brokers you might have some different signals depending on the history but more or less it should be the same, just double check make sure your periods on everything are what they are supposed to be and what the other indicators used look like ex. MACD and make sure the code is giving you the right signal, technically after the squeeze you dont need any of the indicators once you know what the ratio is you can tell by eye where macd is and around the pivot if it's a signal or not in general, the buy or sell signal is just there to help or alert you to look at the chart and once you do you'll see whats going on just my .02

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Unfortunately, I got in before the candle closed as it was heading down strong and while that candle was open during the first half hour it was showing a sell. Then it powered the other way up showing a buy and thats where it closed. Guess that teaches me for jumping in early. No matter, as soon as it swung around and closed as a buy, I did a stop and reverse and am still showing a hold atm. Lucky I still got to profit from my lack of patience...

Wow, I should have been watching the aussie!

--- 帖子 #626 ---
How are your signals triggering regardless of a pivot point break? Can you post your squeeze code?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hey KGB, I am using a code which shows the squeeze regardless of pivot points. I can ascertain if it is close enough to the pivot point to make it a valid high probability signal by keeping the pivot points showing on my charts. The aussie has stalled after that large move yesterday. It would not surprise me at all if it continued its move north due to solid fundamentals for the aussie and against the USD. Here is the current chart showing the squeeze although there is no pivot close to this one...

--- 帖子 #628 ---
(When you get out of jail!) System is tops GC. Can you tell me why you choose just 2 pairs to trade? Are they uncorrelated to each other? It sounds like a good idea.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Alexish If you are still on this thread. Could you include the weekly pivot points into your Bands_Squeeze_v5 ? Excellent programmer!

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Tenshi, Those 2 pairs are used because of the high success rate. Anything that can be traded can be used but some work better than others. Another one you will want to look at is gold on the daily and 1H. It works beautifully on it! Weekly pivot points can be used as well to keep an eye on further confluences with the daily pivot points. Dynami

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thanks Dynami Where can you buy and sell gold? You wouldn't want to bid on the Aus at the same time as the gold would you, too closely related?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
They are fairly closely related, but there are two different mechanisms that drive the two markets. When risk aversion is rampant due to instability in the markets, then people tend to exit their huge carry trade which has the aussie intertwined with it due to the interest rate differential with the yen. So the aussie tends to drop. But also due to this instability, traders and average Joe buy something with intrinsic value like gold. So as you can see, the mechanism behind gold and the aussie are not so clean cut. Sure Australia has alot of gold reserves and when the price of gold goes up, it can be argued that the aussie will also rise. That is simple math, we have alot of something that is getting more valuable every day. Anyway, I think I am getting off track here. There is a correlation between the aussie and gold but that correlation changes due to differing circumstances. Im doing it again... Bottom line, it produces net profit trading both! Dynami

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Thanks Dynami I'm just used to Forex, what brokers offer gold? I use MBTrading and they don't have gold available as far as I can see. Charting as well, gold on MT4?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
FXDD is offering Gold (XAUUSD) and Silver (XAGUSD) and Oanda as well.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Can some of you please do some manual backtesting for this system on the EUR/JPY for the period 26th Nov'07 til 16th Dec'07 (1 hour chart)? I've done some optimisations and have used some best fit parameters, but my auto results show many losing trades during the period mentioned above. Thanks, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi Johnny I haven't done back testing sorry but did you incorporate these tests with the pivot points for those days? Are you using MT4? The bands squeeze is by no means a stand alone indicator and shouldn't in my opinion be used solely for entry and exit. Very useful for describing the present state of the market (ranging or trending or squeezing) and very useful in conjunction with other indicators.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Sorry to post a confession of ignorance at using the MT4 platform and programming in general but...!! Could someone tell me how to set the Bands_Squeeze_v5 indicator to an email alert? thanks Tenshi

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Is email alerts available on MT4??? That would be great if you can!

Yes, email alerts are available. You need to set up your smtp server information under options and then email. The standard alert can be found under the terminal, right click and choose create, but you only have the choice of price: if it goes above or below a certain price. It would be nice if some of those incredible programmers out there could add a few lines of programme for email alerts when the squeeze occurs!!!

I would, but it appears my IG demo expired prior to the 2-week window. I guess they found out I'm from the US, and that I don't live in Buckingham Palace like I claimed when I signed up. darn.. Anyone know of any other broker that offers this software and has a demo period longer than 14 days?

Yes, my auto backtesting used PP's for exit levels and stop levels, but not for entry levels. It's pretty much as per GCT's system, with a few tweeks. Don't worry about the manual testing for now, I'm still ironing some bugs out of the code (there is 11 pages of it now). I don't use MT4, I only use PRT (or CMC 's MarketMaker). To be honest, I find MT4 and it's equivalents an awfully antiquated and not very user freindly programming language. The language used in the PRT platform is very user friendly and I don't think there is any super deep process I've required, that I haven't been able to write code for. I'm not blowing my own trumpet here, rather I just find the language so straight forward and clear to de-bug etc. .

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Wow, I thought MT4 was good! Take my hat off to you programmers!

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I'll agree that MT4 isn't the most robust platform, but I'm not a fan of PRT and its derivatives either. The problem lies in the fact that it's an entirely server-side java-based platform. What if you want to work on charts/systems while offline? You can't.. at least to my knowledge. Also, it won't let you save settings and systems to your local drive either. How much easier would sharing GCT's system have been if we could simply share an MQL file, rather than pasting pages worth of code? If PRT released a desktop version (preferably non-java), that worked in offline mode and saved systems/templates locally, then they would be much more competitive imo.

Anyone that has followed this thread since its inception knows how powerful this tool is. We have all learned a thing or 2 from GCTTrader. While he is serving his time on banishment I think we should all take a second out of our time and "rate" this thread. I was surprised to see that this thread has a "zero" star rating. Go to the first page of this thread and click the link to "rate this thread". I gave it a 5 stars rating..if I could have given it 10 it would be rated as 10! So please take a second and go rate this thread!! Thank you! Rick Thank you Again GCTTRADER...look forward to corresponding with you again!!

Will do. The whole concept of bringing the importance of the squeeze into trading, with indicators to add, deserves a 5 from me too. Look forward to you getting out of jail GCTTrader!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Fxhermit, Thank you for the work you did on this indicator. I also like your pdf file !! I do have one question about something that appears to be a dropped subject. Why did you leave the bandwidth indicator off of your demarker template? To me, that was the most important aspect of this method. I wouldn't place a trade unless bandwidth is below .0056 (it's not a proper squeeze otherwise!). GCTtrader harps on this quite a bit. If you don't like the bbhistotest indicator, may I suggest replacing it with the bandwidth indicator? I am still using your old methodology, and it appears a bit stronger than your current template. Just my observation of it. Thank you again for your input to this forum!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I've done a 4 year backtest (EUR/JPY 1H) and got the following results for the equity curve. The first pic was with a shorter main BB period (16) and a shorter trigger line sample period (33). The second pic was with a longer main BB period (20) and a longer trigger line sample period (43). GCT's default figures for these was 18 and 38, so you can see obviously lengthening these periods gives greater probability of success, with much less opportunity for drawdown. The stop loss in both scenarios was 40 points (snapped to beyond any nearby PP level). The profit target was taken at 2 levels (both snapped to just prior to any nearby PP level). For the first pic it was at 80 and 160 pts. For the second pic it was much less at 50 and 100. The MACD turnaround exit was not used in this test. By the way, this is pretty complex backtesting code and is far from complete ... will no doubt be a work in progress for sometime, but I hope to optimise the required parameters in as tightly as possible. I am contemplating writing in code to move the stop loss to break even once the first profit target has been triggered, however that may not allow automation for me (or many other traders) as I might have to be alerted in the middle of the night to amend my stops upon execution of the first profit level ... as this would be a tricky thing to do using 'if done' and 'oco' orders. If anyone can think of the order syntax to pre-place orders for these exits (and moving the stop to break even), with most non-auto brokers (such as CMC etc.) ... please feel free to post, thanks . Also, I have another question for the professionals out there ... do you feel it would be profitable and less risky on a day to day basis, to trade using parameters which are tested and optimised over a 4 year average period, OR tested and optimised over a 4 month period and continually re-tested and re-optimised every two weeks? Don't jump in with your answer here, as there are pros and cons for both methods, and although the later sounds like a better idea you risk curve fitting the numbers and always playing catchup with perhaps never having the right numbers to be trading with ... so there is a bit to consider. I'd really welcome everybody's comments on this one, thanks!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
JohnnyFOREX, Am I reading your equity curves right? After 4 years, you went from an initial 125,000 to 126,938? That doesn't seem right..

--- 帖子 #650 ---
The 125,000 is only an arbitrary figure, to make some of the results give me a relatively accurate 'return on investment' % figure. However, the difference in equity is what you're needing to be looking at, as this is actually the accurate POINTs gain/loss. So, in this case a gain of 1,938 points was acheived on the EUR/JPY over the 4 year period (or only 1,571 in the 2nd chart, which is the more stable strategy to trade). Yes, this is pretty ordinary ... and to be honest although I'm able to get some fairly reasonable looking equity curves, this is only about 400 points per year, and they all have this very stagnate period for 18 months from May '06 til Oct '07 ... which is an awful lot of work to do for no income at all during that period! Hence, my question above re longer term or shorter term optimisations. By the way, my backtests are done to suit what would typically be an Australian's trading time availability. Therefore in these backtests, trades are only entered between 9am and 10pm Sydney time ... which is of course about half of the day, and is going to be similar results for anyone anywhere in the world really ... given that I'm filtering out about a 12hr period. I am looking at coding in moving the stop to break even though after the first profit exit ... but there is no point in doing this unless traders can see a way to logically place orders and replicate this strategy, on platforms which are not auto-execute platforms (which is the case for the majority of traders). Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Ah, thanks for clarifying this. I was assuming dollar return, not pips/points. Regarding backtests, could you run one based upon 24 hours, rather than the 12-hour window? I'm curious to see how it differs. Keeping a cut-off time of 10pm Sydney (6am NY) excludes a large window of the Euro/US overlap where typically the largest moves in the FX market take place. Also, have you tried any other pairs? I was perplexed as to why so many other pairs I tested underperformed on the 3-month window of data I had access to. It's a fairly robust system that I would assume should work in other pairs over the long run, not just EUR/JPY.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I tried the full 24hr period for you, just over the last 4 months. The profit went down slightly, butt the success % went down quite a bit - I imagine there are too many news releases during this period which activiate the entry trigger on volatility alone ... often incorrectly. So as it happs, it seems the Asian session is probably the best period for this system. I haven't tried other pairs yet (or Gold which GCT recommends). For the time being, I'm thinking fortnightly optimisations of the last 4mths data are the way to go ... and below is the results of the pick of the numbers for the last 4 months. The sotp is 42, profit is 69 (2nd profit is always double this). Trigger float is 5, BB period is 17, trigger smaple period is 46. The exits are always snapped to just before (limits) or just beyond (stops) pivot levels - use your logic here. There are no PP filters on entry and no MACD turnaround exits. I'd also recommend exiting any open positions if they haven't reached your target/s after several hours (may be between half to a full day). By the results are in points ... so 1,429.01 points on period 30Sep07 til 19Jan08. Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Appreciated it Interesting results. Just to confirm, are these full pivot point break signals, or just generated when the BB squeeze expanded beyond the trigger level? (irregardless of the central pivot being broken)

--- 帖子 #654 ---
And Im back from my banishment! So glad to be able to post again. I hope in this time everyone out there has had some great trades as there have been some outstanding trades in the last two weeks. I will post pics and upcoming squeezes as they develop. Thank you John for your efforts, your time invested is quite substantial and it is obvious that you put more time in to trading then your average trader. I hope its paying off. This system gives great entries with minimal risk to reward as the correct entries do seem to return on average 4-5 times the risk. With a profile like that and everyone's continued efforts to enhance and fully understand this system, Im sure we will only improve on this. GCT

--- 帖子 #655 ---
A pic of the last week of trading signals...

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Interesting how we look at this and certainly no disrespect to GCT. Certainly the 4mth backtest gives a profit:loss ratio of 6.59 which is extraordinary in anybody's circle (normally anything between 1.2 and 2.0 is considered good). However, the average winner is 67.38 pts and the average loser is 36.50 pts, so in real terms your reward on average is just under double your risk. Why is this so? Because on a trade by trade basis you don't know whether it's going to be a winner or loser at the time of entry. In your capital management you must plan on risking 36.50 in order to make a possible 67.38 ... naturally as 78% of trades are winners the overall profit:loss ratio will be good at the end of the day, but remember in the interim your reward:risk ratio is in reality 1.85 to 1. In answer to Trader KGB's question ... as I'd mentioned previously there is no PP filter on entry ie. entry occurs on the breakout, regardless of whether it is in the proximity of any pivot point at all, central or otherwise. Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Actually thats not quite correct either Johnny. The reality is, that you have no idea what the average loss is going to be. Backtesting is curve fit on past data and are notoriously unreliable going forward. After backtesting, it is prudent to forward test on demo or at very low risk in a live account. Only then will you discover what the average loss per trade is, and whether or not the system is profitable or not.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hey Douggy ... not exactly . We do know 'almost' exactly what the AVERAGE loss will be, because we decide that in advance. We trade with a set stop loss, in this case 42 pips. The only variation to this is that it is 'PP snapped' so it could decrease or increase by a few points for each trade depending on the PP levels, but this adjustment is made going into the trade, and not left open ended. The only other variable to the average stop loss actually experienced, is that some winning trades turn into losers ... or let me put it another way, some trades do well but do not get to the proift limits, so we end up closing them out after a while if they have failed to achieve targets. So, those trades did not get stopped out for the max stop loss, they would be closed out sometimes for a smaller gain, sometimes for a smaller loss ... in which case the loss in these trades will always be &lt;= the proposed stop loss, thus reducing the 'average' losing trade to 36.50 (and that is relatively predictable). If you wanted to play it safe, you could play worse case scenario and budget your capital management on the actual average set stop loss of 42 ... but personally I think you're robbing yourself of some profit there by not exposing your full proposed % risk (whether that be 2% or 5% etc.). It's a personal thing though of course. Just to clarify ... cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hey Johnny, Thanks for the input. Your SL's are higher than the ones I use hence the different R/R ratio's. This system, like most systems out there can be adjusted to suit different traders styles of trading. Me for example set a SL of between 20 - 30 depending on where the price is compared to pivot points. Once my first TP of the R1 or S1 line has been hit, my SL comes up to entry and half of my lot is exited. Staging out suits my style of trading and it seems to work well. Many books preach about it such as Forex Conquered, Forex patterns and probabilities and trading secrets to name a few. Van Tharp advises against it in a contrarian approach due to when you actually are in a profitable trade, you pull positions out when you did pick it correctly. There are pros and cons to both position management systems. So while two people have the same entry strategy, other areas of a trade can be utterly different whether constructive or destructive depends on that trader. Hope this clears it up, now back to trading! Its a new week of opportunities! GCT

Hello Everyone, Thank you GCTrader1 for sharing this method and all others for your contribution. I have read the entire thread and have tried to get the code and other variables to work with a demo of CMC Market Maker charts Is there anyone in this thread who is using CMC Market Maker and has got the set up to work and look exactly like GCTrader1 chart's? This is the first time I am using the IT finance charts. perhaps some kind soul who is using CMC could do a storybook of screenshots from a beginner perspective of your successful set up? I hope that is not too much to ask. I would really appreciate it Thanks!

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi Longpath, Have a look at the following document. It has code that you copy and paste that should get you started. It is the BB squeeze with John having made some mods. It should work with CMC . Let me know if it doesn't... GCT

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi GCTrader1, thanks for the reply. I tried to apply the instructions, but I really did not understand any of the steps I was taking, or if I was even doing any of it correctly. It may take some person who is not a programmer to post a document of screenshots of the CMC chart set up from a complete 100% beginners perspective of using the IT Finance charts. I have attached some screenshots of my attempt. thanks to anyone who can help... in advance!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
If you look back over this thread, I have already done 2 story book style steup instructions. I dont know what page it is but they are there somewhere. GCT

--- 帖子 #664 ---
For the first section ... you'll need to add 2 more user INDICATOR PARAMETERS, in the same fashion you entered the first couple. These should be BBP and sample (Name Used In Program). The default value can be BBP=18 and Sample 38 ... although good results have been found using 17 and 46 respectively. In the 2nd section, it seems a coupld of parameter names havebeen changed ... change the parameter with a name used in program of period , to sample instead, and like before add another parameter called BBP (with a default value of 18 or 17). These extra parameters were added to allow greater optimisiations and thus greater profit due to the increased flexibility. You can use GCT's screenshot doc too to help you, but don't get confused by the few changes made in this later code which I'd added to. GCT's doc is an excellent guide to get the hang of how to add these indicators into CMC etc.

Did anyone catch any of these? I just got in but a little late... First signal for the Euroyen in a week!

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Spot Gold just signaled a short although the candle has not closed yet, just bringing it to your attention. It could turn around but it definitely is showing a nice squeeze in volatility... GCT

--- 帖子 #667 ---
I pulled 80 pips from that move with Johnnyforex looking on. He had the signal an hour and 60 pips earlier than I did with his optimised code ( he wasnt trading though). Still 80 pips the old fashioned eyeball way isnt too bad + I was in another systems trading room at the time and called the trade. they all got pips but cut out after 20 pips or so - they think Im a legend and want me to do all the calls from now on. I think ill quit while Im ahead - lol

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Thanks Johnny, I got something showing now. I will look back in the posts and see how to get that pretty rainbow Bollinger onto the chart to visually show squeeze ...and thanks GCTrader, I will review the posts again for other info...

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi GC &amp; Johnny Forex Got it displaying looked back at posts and changed all MACD * numbers to 10000 as per Johnny forex. I have read the story books but unclear on actual trading practice are pivot points the targets? How does the trigger line work on Bandwidth, What is the exit strategy How are stops placed? etc is there a trading document that I have missed. Also do the settings change per pair? Has anyone tested it on smaller timeframes say 15min? Thanks for your help I like bollinger systems and trying to keep more price based. Divad

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi Divad, Ok, here we go! Pivot points are a powerful tool in the traders toolbox which is why I chose to use them. On break of a pivot point associated with a squeeze, its game on. The squeeze indicator should indicate which direction to trade in but pretty much trade in the direction of the break. I use PP as profit targets. A good position sizing model that can be used for this strategy is to buy in multiples of 3(3, 6, 9 mini lots). 1st TP - The S1 or R1 depending on direction. Once this is reached exit 1/3 of your position and move your stops up to entry. 2nd TP - The S2 or R2. Once this is reached, exit another 1/3 of your original position and move stops up to R/S1. 3rd TP - This is called a discretionary stop. Use daily charts or any other indicator of your choice to decide this one. You have already locked in plenty of profit so this can be left for a few days if desired to really take advantage of those big rallies. Setting do change for pairs and the sample period for the squeeze and trigger buffer is revised regularly(every few weeks or so). The trigger line on the BBW is there to visually show you where the trigger is in relation to the BBW so you can be ready. Hope this helps Divad, trade well! GCT

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I'm actually going to program the visual rainbow BB squeeze as a custom indicator, because now with my optimisations of GCT's initial default parameters, the BB period is going to periodically change - for example right now a BB period of 17 is more profitable than 18. Seeing as you'd have around 36 instances of manually having to change the period from 18 to 17 (or some other number as the months go by), then changing it just once in an indicator is alot more attractive . Cheers, Johnny. P.S. GCT - You haven't already done this as an indicator have you???

--- 帖子 #675 ---
No I havent made a custom indicator for that, good idea! Remember to make it pretty tho! I hope everyone is doing well in this volatile time. MACDoug, sounds like your doing well. Your account can fall over very quickly in this market atm, crazy times! GCT

--- 帖子 #676 ---
yes , it is crazy times and I had my share of pain caught out long last week. I have only now recovered with a sequence of short trades during the latest unwind. Have a look at how clear the reversal signals have been on JPY crosses and equities daily and 4 hour charts after the fed cut - hammers, railroad tracks, bullish engulfing patterns galore - crazy times are good times to stay alert for opportunities like this

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Greetings, Anyone using metatrader? I thought I'd post this chart and see what you think. All comments welcome. Regards

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Yep GCT, I'm using your default set of rainbow colours - it'll look very pretty . By the way, you all may notice with GCT's indicator some trades which are genuine entries have not shown up on the indicator signalling an entry ... we've had a chat about that it's a small bug which I'm in the throws of correcting at the moment. It will also affect the backtest results and maybe the parameters too, as more trades will now be signalled (if the extras are winners then things are good ... if the extras are losers well, that's not so good - it's probably swings and roundabouts though) . Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Looks good Sun-Care to post your template?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I agree, nice work there suncare. How are adjustments made? Say if the trigger buffer needs adjusting? Just curious as I haven't used MT4 before. Did anyone see the trade last night? I live in the wrong timezone! I miss so many nice trades because of damn sleep! lol. Here is the chart of it...

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Nice work. I am assuming the Bollinger Band colour changes are displaying entry and exit signals like GCTraders' IT Finance indicator. If so, I am assuming the reason some entries are triggered while the BB is contracting is due to the dynamic level that you guys are now using to trigger entries. I am still using my eyes based on an increase in bandwidth so I would have been late into many of those trades. I still mange to profit this way, but I am impressed with the accuracy of your indicator and that fact that the signals are given from the bandwidth indicator without the need of a separate indicator to advise of entry triggers

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Here's the template you requested...I'm hoping for some input to improve its performance. The main indicators are from this thread, of course. I have only added the daily, weekly and monthly pivots I am attaching to this post. Thanks for the interest in the metatrader version of GCTrader's system. regards

--- 帖子 #683 ---
What do I need to see the waves on the chart. I do get the indicator says band_squeeze v5 on the bottom window but dont see all those waves on the chart. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #684 ---
The waves are bollinger bands which im sure you knew. They are many bollinger bands added to the main chart with a variance of 0.2 to the standard deviation. I added 12 in there myself but they are a visual representation of the squeeze. The squeeze by the way is on for the euro and the aussie although they are fake squeezes in as much as the FOMC announcement is due out later so naturally there is a squeeze. After the announcement could indicate a good entry after say 15min. GCT

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Hey GCTrader...first welcome back. Second, there is a pending trade on EJ is there not? It's been brewing for the better part of 22 hours. Bandwidth is finally below .0056. What do you think? I don't have a trigger yet though? What is taking it soooo long? Rick

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Thanks Colostarr, Yes there is a squeeze but like I said earlier, it is due to the rather massive FOMC announcement which is what everyone is waiting for. Any trade signal untill then is useless. A trade can be made after the signal has been given after 15 minutes after the ann. which would give sufficient time for the market to settle down and go in the direction of fundamentals instead of irrational movements. Should be an interesting one thats for sure! I will be awake for this one... GCT

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Oh that is just awesome...no wonder it went the other way and I was stopped out a full 2 lots. Ouch...$1,000.00 gone...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I had to do something...dropping $1,000.00 was PAINFUL:surprised. I doubled my lots (in with 4 lots). Took 28 pips on the rebound and BAILED!! I haven't sat that close to the edge of my seat in a few months. I felt like I was rooting for my favorite team in the Super bowl. It was 4th and 10, 2 seconds left, down by 4. Hail Mary to the end zone. Thank God...it was caught...TOUCHDOWN! I can breath again . That trade had "Margin Call" written all over it. I think I will go be sick now. I did actually manage to scrape $120 profit. I am done for the day...gonna go change my shorts now. Note to self...check pending news before going large! Rick

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Wow, good that you made a come back but yes always check on up and coming announcements. I'm going to say this but im sure you already know but had a lapse . You should only trade a position so that you risk only 2 - 5% of your total account. As soon as you get emotional and start to "get even" with the market, bad things happen! Take care of your account and print out your rules for trading(which should be written down) and stick it above your monitor. Time trading has taught me many lessons Hope you trade well. GCT

--- 帖子 #690 ---
In the past I was known for being reckless (see BAT method). That taught me a valuable lesson. My account went from $17k to 3$ k in a matter of about 10 days. I learned a lesson there, and until this happened yesterday I have been very conservative. Slowly rebuilding my account. I just got the signal after sitting on it for 24 hours, I knew it was going to explode. I just didn't expect it to explode the other way! I use stop loss now. With the BAT method I did not use stops...and it almost drained me completely! Lesson learned....no matter how many things you experience, there is always 1 more lesson hiding around the corner. Whew....it did teach me a lesson. I haven't traded at all today. Still a bit shaken from yesterday! :surprised

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Please find attached some updated indicators based on GCT's original stuff ... but please also read very thoroughly as each indicator will require parameters to be set, and perhaps re-adjusted as time goes by and the global mechanics of the market changes. Also included here is the new Visual BB Squeeze Indicator, all pre-coded for your comfort ! ... more importantly it allows you to change the BB period for all standard deviation bands, via one simple setting change ... and this allows it to be tied into the parmater settings on the other indicators for this system. I'd actually recommend putting the visual squeeze indicator as a separate indicator under your main price chart, rather than overlayed on it ... this allows (in MM and PRT anyway), for you to accurately see the price and PP data displayed in the value boxes (without excessive clutter), if you use that feature. Happy trading, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Mmm, I don't seem to be able to edit my previous post, to update / replace the attachment. Anyway a couple of minor corrections have been made (primarily to the Trade entry/exit trigger) and the updated document is attached. The ZIP packages to assist with parameter setup is not yet available, I'll get around to that when I have further time to do so , but you can do it without that if you read carefully and think logically . Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Johnny Tried your programing on MM in UK coloured lines work great, Band width and trigger line work also but Sqeeze Trade entry / Exit has problems A MACD THRESHOLD is not defined in Parameters. Previous Set to 2 in Parameters when added verifies ok. If put on GBP/USD no buys or sells show but on USD/JPY some buys and sells show using default parameters. Are there different parameters or program settings for each currency pair? Could you tell me which pair you tested your settings on then we can compare results. Thanks for the programing David

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Has anybody noticed that the Squeeze indicator repaints itself? Also, curious as to the results others experienced on last night's trade 2/4. I got a sell signal by the squeeze on 1H EURJPY @ 8:00 pm EST and was stopped out for -30 at 12 am EST right before a huge drop downward soon after. Were others watching the charts when the first sell signal came out?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Sundowner and all using MT4, why don't you guys write some EA for it? Or at least an indicator that would email/alert when bands squeeze for people that have a day job? thanks

--- 帖子 #696 ---
The Euroyen was challenging last night but for some who perceviered with the system were paid such as John, nice going. Also there was a trade on the Aussie short which i entered at 9054 and had a TP of 8995 which was well and truly hit while i was sleeping, I love when that happens. What sold me on the short aussie was the double top (eve &amp; adam) which shows a high probability of a turnaround. One look at my fav book, encyclopedia of charting patterns, revealed some great stats that sold me. As you can see in the chart there were in fact two signals although the first one is null and void due to it being the lead up to the aussie interest rate announcement. The second one, however was after the aftermath and coincided with the double top...a killer combo! It is starting to consolidate again but has missed on making a new low. Similar story with the euroyen showing a consolidation but is most likely just continuing the downtrend along the 18EMA. All in all, a good night! GCT

--- 帖子 #697 ---
We are trying, trust me! That was the first thought that come to my mind. John and I are both in talks with the charting company, PRT, to sms when the signal has been given. Currently they do that with their indicators but not custom ones such as the squeeze. We hope to have that rectified soon. GCT

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Unfortunately I am clueless when it comes to programming. Regards

--- 帖子 #699 ---
GCTrader, How do you mean, perceveired with the system? The trade was stopped out for loss, then the squeeze indicator gave a buy signal, which was subsequently stopped out for another loss on the way back down as the squeeze indicated a second sell... I am confused.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
So there is an EA in the makings that will trade automatically for MT4? If not then I could create one. Only problem is that I don't know what all variables in the backtest code in the word document are.

SimonJ, I don't think that there is an MT4 EA in the making.

GCTrader, how do you avoid the whipsawing in the indicator? I don;t see that in your indicators, whereas in MT4 sometimes it's the opposite signal that is given initially or only one candle of a false signal. Just check sundowners screen shot above. In the beginning of it there is false buy signal (second from the left). Your indicators look so clean... Could you elaborate on that?

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Yep, quite correct David - I forgot to mention the 'A' parameter in the notes. I fixed that now, and will re-publish in a little while but am making a further addition to the trade entry indicator which will predict in how many hours the BBW or squeeze is expected to back under the trigger line again. If you're going to use it with the GBP/USD or any other 4 decimal place pair, there may be an issue in this particular indicator - I'll need to take a look at that. In some of the indicators though it is catered for ... you need to manually change the value of 'pcv' from 2 to 4 in the code (as I didn't make that a paramater ... guess I could though ).

--- 帖子 #704 ---
"Stick with the system"??? The chart that GCT displayed above was for the AUD/USD not the EUR/JPY. The Aussie did not have the whipsaw, but the EUR/JPY did and I got caught in exactly those numbers as you stated. I stuck with the system though and my first trade was reversed for a -30 loss, the second was fully stopped out (for me it was an -82 in this case as I got stopped out by only 2 pips!), then the final reverse went onto win (for me it was only +75), but recovered most of the earlier losses. It would have been easy to pull the plug and not take the 3rd trade ... imagine how I would have felt in the morning to see I'd missed a winner and the chance to recover quite a few pips. I have introduced a 'stpd' variable into the backtest to see how a restriction of limiting the trading to only a 'Single Trade Per Day' - this will certainly alleviate the whipsaw because it would force you to stay in and ride out the first trade of the day, and if it got stopped out then take the rest of the day off (possibly due to choppiness). I know this seems contrary to the my comments above, but what I mean by that is to stick with the system which you feel is proven to be the best for you. The 'stpd' concept actually doesn't look too bad - it gives a better equity curve and much reduced drawdowns ... although in some periods not as much profit. I need to do more testing on it though.

Nice signal on the USD/JPY a few hours ago. Gained 95 pips. How many valid signals will you get in a month on one pair? Once a day? I guess not. I get the impression from backtesting EUR/JPY abit that sometimes you catch the end of the breakout. Anyone experienced that?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Johnny Firstly to make indicator display on GBP/USD I changed the MACD multiplier from 100 to 10000 and it seems to be ok. What is PCV? The addition of your next addition "making a further addition to the trade entry indicator which will predict in how many hours the BBW or squeeze is expected to back under the trigger line again." This will be good. Is there a way of scanning Forex pairs for the squeeze on a particular timeframe and alerting us to those that are worth looking at? David

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Exactly. I've been trying various indicators, but the difficulty seems to be that the indicators I have tried all support the false signal. Any ideas? The only thing I can think of is sound mm at this point. Regards

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Hi Jasius, Unfortunately there is no real way that I know of yet that can enable you to avoid head fakes. There are a few that can avoid some of them such as not trading the signal given right before a substantial news event. On the 15min chart it can be sometimes traded but it is not for the faint heart. Even bollinger himself could not find a definitive answer for that question. Sound money management is definitely the true answer for this problem. As long as you are able to keep trading and have not blown your whole account then you can still get into those unreal winner... GCT

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Bollinger did give an idea in his video. Put half a position on the original signal, if it continues that way, at least you haven't missed the signal completely. If it turns out to be a head fake, close that half (stop loss it out) and put a full position on the correct breakout direction. He was talking about the daily stock charts though, need to apply that to shorter term forex. Lesson being, if you get tricked going the wrong direction, don't get all hurt, it is not forseeable, just close it and go the other way.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Thats an interesting idea. I dont know if it will turn out profitable in the long term tho but it is worth writing it into code and backtesting it. I think just sound money management will lead to long term profits. I will post the results of the backtest. Hopefully we will get a few good trades this week! GCT

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Just for info, I have found from the backtesting that in the long term the most profitable (and most robust stable system) comes from only entering on the FIRST trigger enountered, and riding out the stop and profit levels on that basis ... and ignoring any subsequent reversals whilst in that particular trade.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
The squeeze is on! Aussie is showing a squeeze of 0.0033 just above the central pivot point. It could make a nice break down or continue its move higher, time will tell! GCT

--- 帖子 #713 ---
-30 stopped out on EURJPY last night. On a 250 pip losing streak trading 1H EJ.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
What settings are you using for EJ? There was no signal for EJ last night and even if I dropped down the sample period, it ends up about 100 pips up. I went in on the aussie signal and only made 20 pips but still a win. The 3rd pic shows the sample period at 36 on the euroyen. GCT

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Missed an awesome gold signal as well! GCT

--- 帖子 #716 ---
GCTrader There was a signal on the EJ 1Hour last night. I have attached the picture for you to look at and tell me what you think. I drew a vertical line in black where yesterday's pivot point was, and circled in red the bandwith indicators contraction below the trigger for over 4 hours, and subsequent widening at the signal entry point.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
There definitely was an increase in bandwidth as stated but the squeeze wasn't tight enough to signal an entry. I think your trigger buffer level is set too high, what is it set at on the euroyen? GCT

--- 帖子 #718 ---
These are the variables I am using on the Squeeze INdicator: L = Trigger = 0.0056 A = MACD = 6.2 B = Bollinger Bandwith = 18 Thanks for the help....because even on the chart you can see the squeeze was below 0.0056 trigger level, which is what I thought we were utilizing for 1H EuroYen.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
It seems you may not be using GCT's dynamic trigger, which varies the trigger level according to recent tightness in the BBW. By the way, I've attached the latest version and updates to a few of the indicators ... all have changed since the last attachment. Setup screenshots are not yet available, however I've provided a final setup screenshot on the last page of the document. I've added some neat features such as estimated time til 'imminent breakout' is in place. Trade at your own risk though, I take no responsibility for these indicators - as they take some careful setup and monitoring. Happy trading, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Sorry guys - I just made a minor improvement to the time estimator for the entry trigger (on a 1hr chart for example, it will now show a minimum of 1hr if the BBW is on the decrease but not yet reached the trigger line - previously it may have shown zero if the time estimate was 30mins or less). Please see new document and code (entry trigger indicator just updated).

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Thanks for highlighting this, you'll notice in the above set of updates that there is now a 'decimal points' parameter, so you can easily set it depending on whether the currency pair trades in 2 or 4 decimal places ... and this will also adjust the MACD calculation - so fingers crossed all the indicators should now work for any currency pair . Cheers, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Johnny Forex Thanks for the indicator programming looks excellent http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif and loading instructions great will try trading tomorrow but looks good. Thanks again David

--- 帖子 #723 ---
GCTrader Just a thought as I like Bollinger squeeze systems. I was wondering whether yourself and others interested in your system fancy getting together on "skype chat" whilst live trading to share ideas and gain a better understanding of how you bring pivots into play etc. As I said just a thought Divad

--- 帖子 #724 ---
That is a great idea, I will post a time when both John and I can be on skype at night(aussie time) and possibly when there is a squeeze on. That way we can talk about the lead up, what are the fundamentals, technicals, up and coming news and so forth. My hotmail is brent1979@hotmail.com and my skype is gctrader79 GCT

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi GCTRADER Sent you a message on Skype. Divad

--- 帖子 #726 ---
i didnt get it mate, try and add me... GCT

--- 帖子 #727 ---
The squeeze is on although again it is a monday and a public holiday at that. This ensures less volume and a natural squeeze. My advice would be to watch it but would not commit the usual allotment if triggered. A nice trigger down would be nice which would fit in with the fundamentals of the concern over German banks. GCT

--- 帖子 #728 ---
I have been giving some thought to how to improve the system during periods of consolidation, ie. trying to filter out false entries. Although we have the dynamic trigger line, this doesn't exactly cover consolidating periods fully. It just means that if the market has been narrow, then we need to be even more narrow for a breakout to be possible. However, it doesn't alter the actual breakout criterea, ie. a small breakout (increase in BBW) could still trigger an entry and this would be exactly the same breakout criteria for a market which had not been consolidating. I am proposing we have the acutal breakout crieteria, ie. the required increase in BBW to be also dynamic - somehow a reflection of where the trigger line is at (but inversely so). At the moment, the BBW is required to increase by a minimum of .0001 for it to be considered to be widening / breaking out. I believe if the trigger line is lower than 'normal', then the required BBW increase should be larger than .0001 and if the trigger line is &gt;= what is considered to be normal, then .0001 suffices perfectly. So GCT, we need to come up with a formula for this and then I can optimise the actual coefficient to get the best number. I'm thinking along these lines as a benchmark ... Trigger &gt;= .0044 required BBW increase = .0001 Trigger &lt; .0044 required BBW increase = .0003 Naturally this needs to be a sliding scale. rqBBWI=Requried BBW width increase TRGL=Trigger line value IF TRGL&lt;.0044 THEN rqBBWI=.0001 + (.0044 - TRGL)/3 ENDIF Another idea, which I think I actually prefer (which does not include the above criteria), is once an entry is triggered we note the BollingerBand value at +2.4 std dev and -2.4 std dev at this time . We then do not enter the trade until price passes this level (providing that at the time this occurs an entry trigger is still showing as valid ie. needs to occur probably within a couple of hours of the supposed breakout). This means that the breakout has to be validated as quite significant before we enter. Naturally, this may mean we get later entries sometimes - but it might tend to keep us out of minor channel trading / price varaitions during periods of prolonged consolidation, where the system currently tends to poise itself for even quite a small breakout. Everybody's thoughts please? Of course if you have any other ideas for filters in this regard, please don't be afraid to put them forward. Thanks, Johnny.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
There is a continued squeeze (from yesterday) on EJ. Bandwidth is very low and a break out is immanent! GCT any ideas about pending news? I just looked and didn't see anything of significance... Rick

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Correct, there is a squeeze on atm but no breakout as of yet. Keeping a close eye on it now. No truly significant news out this week that concerns us. Hopefully signal a nice trade. Missed an awesome trade on the aussie last night worth 60 pips. GCT

In long EJ 158.94....missed the signal by 10 minutes

Those Damn HeadFakes! Something has to be done about them! John and I will not stop till we have come up with a solution that atleast eliminates some of them... Oh the humanity...

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Same here...only lost 50 pips (half lot)...learned my lesson from before!!

--- 帖子 #734 ---
is anyone still following this system? how are the results? by the way, i'm interested in setting up the mt4 files from sunflower or Alexish.... however the amount of bollinger band numbers seem to be different than the amount GCT is using.... why is that? i know it's not that big of a deal as long as they show the contraction... but just curious.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
I have had the same issue, I think you need to set the MT4 indicator so that the trigger number is calculated using the same number of back-bars that GCTrader and others are using on the other platform. I think that the MT4 indicator was programmed a while ago and the default settings do not seem to match what most traders are using now... See the TriggerCountBar setting in the indicator to see what I am talking about...

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hi Pipbagger, That value is about right, atm I'm using 45. The lack of quality signals of late has me looking at other pairs however it did pick the top of euryen on friday. The volatility doesnt seem to be contracting much lately at all so there havent been many nice squeezes in a while. Still keeping my eye out in these uncertain times... GCT

--- 帖子 #737 ---
hey GCT how do you determine the Number of bars to look back? and why do you use that number for ERUJPY.... i dont particular trade ONE pair... i look at multiple pairs and look for oppotunities within all of them.... so was curious if you could explain why you pick certain number for certain pair. also what pivots do you use? in the chart you just posted... are those weekly or monthly pivots? (and also support and resistance i'm assuming?) could you upload the code to that perhaps? would really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
My first post here. sorry for my bad English. First I have to thank GCTrader1 for share this great system. after adjust some parameter and add in money management, in the back test, I am able to turn $400 to $29000 in 3 month. so amazing. the parameter: EUR/JPY H1 B=24, l=0.0078, a=6.2 p=24, macd(9,14,1) stop loss 20 pip, use 100% capital, $200 per lot $1. The stratege is so unique. after read the code again and again, I still have some question to ask. 1. the furmula if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 it is eg: round(2.51) -1.99=3-1.99=1.01 &gt; =1 round(3.49) -2 =3-2 &gt; =1 some times 0.52 dif, sometimes 1.49 dif why ? should it be round( 2.51-1.99) ? if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))) &gt;=1 This has little effect to the stragegy, but this should be more logical. 2. the exit strategy. if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A then It means only when there is a sudden, big drop in price, we will only sell to close position. but if the price is slowly drop.... it will never close the position. I have enounted once , it slowly drop until I lose 90K out of 100K. But in overall, this still works very well, so amazing. I have tried other exit stragegy eg: when moment(12,close) &lt; 0 as in some books. and that result in very low performance.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Can you explain the exact rules you are applying on the pivot point in coordination with this strategy...for example let say the price brakes the main pivot by like 5 pips and are also having a cross of the center cable of the bolling bands. Would you wait for a bigger break of the pivot and aim for R1 or S2? My second question is, lets say you do enter on a small break of the pivot with a cross of the center cable of the bolling bands and on the next candles it crosses the cable the other way again...would you swap positions? Thanks Guys, please help me out.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
That sounds like over-leveraging and curve-fitting to me.. Be careful on curve-fitting when running backtests. I'll agree this system backtests suspiciously well on recent EURJPY data, but try to backtest it any further back (&lt;'07) or on any other currency, and the results aren't nearly the same (if even positive at all).

Due to changes in the market conditions the look back period is adjusted within a certain range. It also depends on the trader. If you only want a lower low than quite some time meaning that you wait for it to be really tight, then you set a longer look back period. Different pairs have different volatilities so differing variables must be used. The euroyen is much more volatile than the aussie and so forth. I use daily pivots as they show great resistance and support. Pivot points are standard indicators with any charting package. GCT

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Ok, a few things here. 1. the furmula if (round((BollingerBandWidth[b](close))*10000)-((BollingerBandWidth[b](close[1]))*10000))&gt;=1 This has EVERYTHING to do with the system, this picks the increase in the BBW and is stage 1 in the entry process. 2. the exit strategy. if abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close[1])))) - abs((round(MACDline[5,13,1](close)))) &gt;= A This exit strategy is nothing more than one really simple way to exit the trade, it never was meant to be the best. I find personally that the pivot points make great exit levels which is what I use but I always keep an eye on the MACD for a turnaround. 100% capital should never be used, 5% at the max! Any trader is doing extremely well if you can pull in 10% a month, if you find this too modest of a target for repeatable returns than please prove me wrong and post. So in finishing, yes this strategy makes sense and works well but money management will pull you through when it does not. Let your winners run and cut your losses. Best of trading, GCT

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Jets, When the BBW is at a new low while it is around the central pivot point and it breaks away and the BBW is increased by more than 1 point than an entry is signaled in the direction of the break. You can swap positions and enter in the other way, these scenarios are known as head fakes. I personally dont go with that strategy and reverse my position but it can be profitable. The only time that you really dont want to be doing that is when it is in a consolidation phase, this could have you swapping and changing for quite some time. The system is pretty refined now thanks to many peoples input like John's but could still use a little more to hopefully recognize those periods and automatically adjust variables depending on prevailing market conditions. Hope this helps, GCT

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Well i whant to give a littel back to this forum....so the way i have been able to filter some trades in this strategy is by using the moving average exponential 256....it can filter certain trades. You can also place it as a limit...For example if it comes prior to a pivot i would place my limit to the ema insteat of the pivot...i hope this helps in any away.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
What exact time and day is that signal given on? GCT

Its on the GBP/JPY its on March 7 at 5...

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Well i have been combining the ema 256...and 64....when ever the mid boliinger cable crosses the 64 ema and the crosses its towards the 256 ema its seems 2 be good trade....what do you think? More precisely when a candle closes on the other side of it not really the croses.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
What time frame

--- 帖子 #751 ---
hi, ALEXISH: First I'd like to thank you for your share of your code. I am a programmer, so I can read code, although I am new to IT and MT4. But I have read all the code here. GCT's code, and your code from Version 1 to V5. I think you have misunderstand GCT's original meaning. The entry is When BB is below triger level, eg 0.0056 and just start to increase , that is the entry point. eg: triger 0.0056, BB goes down to 0.0032 and the next bar it change to 0.0033, this is the entry point. and it can catch the earliest change in trend. But in your program. you only entry when BB goes cross over 0.0056, and that is too late. you may adjust you triger to 0.0032, but next time it may be 0.0042, you will miss it, but in GCT's formula he can catch all of them.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
No squeeze worthy of a look on the aussie atm even tho the trigger level has come up it is nowhere near the pivot point. Keeping a close eye on it for now tho, I would not be surprised to see the aussie back at the 95 level in the near future... GCT

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thanks for looking at this from a coder's point of view. Hopefully there is an MT4 coder that can address this. GCTrader's use of BB Bands is brilliant. MT4 programmers... little help please. I've been looking about for other confirming indicators and it would be great if the coding issue you've pointed out could be addressed. Regards

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I hope we didn't give up on this system. It looked really promising. Its been six days since the last post....people used to be posting everyday in here. Where are you guys?

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I found this thread about a month ago, and have been playing around with some of the techniques. First things first - Thank you GCTrader1 for sharing your great system and generosity! Looks like your "mum" taught you well Also thanks to all who have contributed - especially the programmers. I trade off of a MT4 platform. I finally finished reading the thread from post one just last night. I have been using 4xhermits initial program (indicator, listed in the first ten pages of this thread I believe). While I have not yet used this system with the triggers, I have found that if I eyeball it - if I wait to see a channel of the upper and lower BBands, then a bit of a pinch/squeeze, and then a great dialation, in conjunction with the PP and MACD, all based on GCT's ideas, that I can do pretty well. Though not as well. When I have a bit more experience I will post some screen shots and tell you how I'm doin'. btw 1- I am only paper trading with it at this point. btw 2- I believe that "bandwidth" here is meaning the distance, measured in pips, between the top set of BBands and the bottom set of BB. If I am wrong, would someone please correct me

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Using Alexish's version 5 template, and fxhermits template I saw a really nice buy signal on the E/Y this morning, 5-8 am EST - a squeeze just above the days PP, and volitility expanding. Got in long at 153.83 with SL set 153.56 just below PP, and TP set to 154.89 (in between R2 an R3), with a trailing stop of 30. I came home from work to find it hit my TP I'm trying to post my images to show you, but if they aren't showing, then I have done something wrong and will have to figure it out next... Anyone else trade this? Did you see something similar? {Link Removed}

Thanks again to all who have helped make this thread great!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
here was a mini signal, at 4 am E.S.T. Since I don't have 'buy' and 'sell' singnals, I use the following info to decide if I will make a trade, and in this case, it was all there - and proved to be a +100 pip movement in expected direction: Price was above central s.m.a., and above daily pivot, b.b bands squeezed, MACD was up compared to previous time frame, and candle drove up into the b.b.'s. Still though, this is a bit crude compared to the real pivot point squeeze method........ but no one else has been talking.... any one out there? http://picnac.com/images/3674ey_ff post_ii.gif

Any MT4 traders out there using Alexish's progam catch this buy signal? It is up 240 pips now, and only had a 20 pip drawdown from signal to get in long. Wow. Thanks again GCTrader and Alexish! http://picnac.com/images/1180ey_up 240 from signal.gif

worth the wait. anyone see this move? It began at 9am EST, band width was 60, price broke below daily pivot and ema, and tagged into the lower BB's as the began to grow their butterfly wing... too bad I was at work for this one http://picnac.com/images/8378ey_bw60_9am.gif

Hey GCtrader1, Are you still using IGMarkets with no problems?

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Yes, I still use IGMarkets and haven't had a problem with them yet. A couple of beautiful trades last night on the Aussie and Gold. In at 8359 and out at 8490 Gold, in at 884.95, out at 900. Attached is the pics that alerted me to the trades. A couple of nice trades that showed me that the system still works in volatile times. GCTrader

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Aussie was above the daily pivot the whole session, there was no upward break from below. Or is that no longer an entry requirement?

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Quite correct, it was not a break of the pivot point. But with the current climate in the financial markets, a break of a consolidation period which is in line with fundamentals, it was a gamble I was willing to take. A consolidation around the PP would have made it a golden signal but I have found that it does not make that much difference whether the break is at a pivot point or not, but it does make the argument more convincing. GCT

JohnnyFOREX &amp; GCtrader Amazing the results of this system ! I was wondering or there are any updates regarding the cooperation between you both to workout a filter for the false entries? Just got myself a ProRealTime account and can’t wait to try the updated code and work together with you to improve the system (if that is possible as it is already very good, )

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hello, Wondering if this is correct. Don't have PRT, remembered there were errors in the MT4 version. I coded a couple for NinjaTrader, wondering if these signals are correct. If they are I can start a correct MT4 version when I have time. GCTrader or anyone using PRT, can you confirm these signals? Feed is Gain. Thank you. Edit: Almost forgot, EURUSD 60M. Not concerned about any valid trades, just whether bars are correctly shown.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
hey guys does this still work or what?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
It does, although like most trading strategies it works great for a while and then it seems like it has a 'break' from working. Me and a few others are working on trying to figure out what it is that makes it stop being as effective. Current theory is that excessive, prolonged volatility cause the bollinger bandwidth to be high for extended periods without settling down to a contracted state long enough to be considered a signal. Also trying to work out the best strategy for position sizing, as that is key to any trading strategy. Anyone have any good position sizing tactics?

Hi GCT, I am new to participating here. I just saw your setup. Do you have any code that you can share or any particular details, so I might program this to metatrader 5.0 ?? I am willing to share once coded. Happy to do that. Two traders with the same good strategy will have different results- depending on money management. Many thanks for anyone who will and can share for my request. Cheers, G.

Hi GCT, Position sizing tech. are discussed by Van Tharp for the stock market- it would be the same for Forex. Also : Dr. Alexander Elder's book: also talks about money management in his book called: Trading for a Living . Basically increasing your position of 30-40 % of your current lot size once you have a sound technique that you consistently follow through on. But don't increase in lot size until you can consistently win. Increasing position size on a less than 50% win strategy is only gambling and eventually you WILL lose. Hope this helps, G.

Hi Sharp Traders, Not sure if GCT is still around , but for those who are - I suggest the following: 1- yes, this method still works. It works in time periods better than others- some months the long term trends have played out , so the price action (PA) does take a rest. Sometimes you can see that if a lot of traders take the same entry at the same time the action can show quicker swings and momentum. 2- So, remember the method works, but better at other times. 3- Never expect any system to work just for you at all times- only an idiot would think that and deserves to lose money- hey there is still some thinking required. Remember that when the market is overextended in many time periods: week, day, hour, etc- then you're more likely to have a swing in the other direction - to balance out the lopsided condition. Hope this helps. Cheers, G.

Morning folks !! I have stumbled across this thread purely by chance and I have to say it has caught my attention. I use prorealtime through IG and was quite thrilled to find the code for probacktesting. However, has some have mentioned the optimization takes an eternity and no matter how hard I look I can't find an updated code (should there be one) which overcomes this problem. Would someone be kind enough to provide all the current information one needs to trial this system. Thanks to all you guys who work so hard for us mere mortals who have not a clue how to code, especially GCTrader. s2m
