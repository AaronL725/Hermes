Folks, I want to bring on here a very simple strategy. The basis of this strategy is the use of two traditional tools which are Zigzag and fibonacci. Sell Rules : 1. Drag Zigzag indicator on the chart and leave default settings for now. Zigzag just helps to identify the swings but any trader should be able to identify the swings with the naked eye. 2. Identity a Low (L) and a High (H). Wait for price to break the low to form a (LL). 3. Draw a fib retracement from the LL to the H. 4. Enter short if price retraces to your desired fib level. I prefer the 78.2. 5. You may use other filters such as Rsi or stochastic 6. The best trades are the ones where: a. price spent a great deal of time forming the L-H leg b. there was a lot of consolidation around the H leg. c. price didn't take too long to return to the fib level. At the same time we don't want too fast a return as that may be institutional buying and a potential trend change. Note also that for strongly trending markets, price may not often retrace past the 50.0 fib level. Buy rules are the opposite . THREAD RULES: Spammers and trolls will be blocked without any warnings . Please keep your charts and posts central to the core of this strategy.

Hi Friend, Nice Simple Strategy !! What you think to use with RENKO Chart ?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi. Do you have more examples to let us take a look at? Thanks for your effort. I also use fibonacci to trade.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Nice strategy! Here is an indi maybe it helps somebody 2nd picture is an example of zig-zag 89-5-3

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here's an indie that draws fibo retrace and you can choose which leg you want to be drawn. Is actually the missing piece from the previous indi https://www.mql5.com/en/code/18078

Great!!! So don't be shy, post your view....it's important

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you MQLTrade I am trying to understand system.What is the entry rule? price touch the 78.2

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Yes EngineerFX advises to use 78.2 for reversal entry, i prefere area 61.8/78.6

--- 帖子 #39 ---
OK Should I wait the bar close or just only touch the line? and what is the stop loss?

For me it's all automatic, indicator tells me

For a buy trade to be valid, do you wait for a higher high and a higher low? And for a sell trade to be valid, do you wait for a lower high and a lower low?

Hello MQLTrade, would you do a Analysis for AU based on H4 (I do not have your indi)? Best regards, Renko

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Sure, here AU 4H

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thank you very much, Renko

--- 帖子 #64 ---
U are welcome! AU is interesting also on Daily...quotes are also in Reversal Zone....when many TFs has the same setting, pattern is STRONG

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Where did you get this indi from?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I bougth it from FF Commercial Section: "ABCD Auto Detector" ....i found it very usefulif u believe in Fibonacci Trading Approach

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #68 ---
MQLTrade, are you using this as a discretionary trader or an algorithmic trader?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I'm a discretionary trader but i like indicators that they done boring work. In this way i can be focused on entry &amp; management of trades i think that Human Brain is the best EA on the market Traders must be open-mindedness, for indicators/EA not easy to be

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Adapting the OP's original rules as much as possible, I attempted to run a TDS tick data backtest to gauge if this is worth pursuing. TP &amp; SL were missing from his original rules, so I made my own assumptions. Assumptions made: EURUSD, H1, Jan 2015 - Jan 2020 Default ZZ settings, buy / sell on HHHL / LLLH No other indicators Fib retracement level: 78.2% Fixed TP / SL: Within Fib levels

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Great Job. Even if summarize Fibonacci Approach into EA is not easy... My experience says that each level has a tollerance, and for this reason it's hard to code but trader should use eyes &amp; brain

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I'm not sufficiently convinced that what is laid out in the original rules (even with the oscillators) would make for a good strategy, but I won't discount the tendencies for Fib levels to be points of support / resistance (self-fulfilling prophecy or not). Looking forward to hear if anyone has any success with Fibs - I can incorporate it into code if that works.

Hi carddard! My experience says that NOT ALL WORKINNG can be CODED. Many traders think that EA is the only way to profit but it isn't. EYES, BRAIN &amp; MONEYMANAGEMENT.... this is the key IMHO….. (&amp; a bit of lucky )

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I'm not sure why you keep harping on this point mate. If discretionary trading works for you, I'm genuinely happy for you. I know both successful discretionary and algorithmic traders, so both ways work. But if one works better for you then go ahead. Use it. Personally, going fully automated works for me because it saves me tons of time and helps me get rid of bad strategies from the beginning. I also get to keep my day job while trading in the background while I work, completely hands-free and emotionless. One thing that confuses me though, is that your "eyes, brain and money management" is based on an indicator you bought from a commercial member, telling you where to enter, TP and SL. And you enter trades based on those instructions... So.. How discretionary! I suggest that we get back to the topic that the OP started and see if other harmonic patterns help with trading. That would be a better use of time in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
The original rules that the OP posted, could fall prey to the classic ABCD reversal if caught on the wrong side of the ZZ leg. But it seems be worthwhile looking at with a trend filter, to ensure that you are on the right side of the trend. The ABCD approach that MQLTrade uses banks on the classic ABCD reversal. With the use of tight stops and other confirmations of a potentially reversing trend, it could be a good approach even if the "reversal" is really just a quick retracement (Assuming that trailing stop is used upon trade entry).

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I sorry if u read my post as attack to u, it isn't. Discretional or algorithmic approach, doeasn't matter, the important thing is to close end of day GREEN A new day is coming, green pips to all...and stay safe

--- 帖子 #98 ---
No harm done mate. All is well. I know you said you bought the indicator from a commercial member here. But would you be able to share more details about how it works? It seems like it is entering trades based on the classic ABCD reversal pattern. Is that accurate?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yes! Fibo Analysis (right chart) show swing by swin potential reversal zone according FIbonacci Approach ABCD. I use it to find areas where quotes could be sensitive e try to advise trader how to move. Left chat show only potential entries and tp based on fix model or ATR model I found it very accurate. I wanted something automatic to tell me "Hey we are in a good area to trade according Fibonacci Approach" and it do this fast &amp; great

GJ 1H...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
The past few days of researching Fibonacci retracements has led me to conclude that in its simplest form, there are 2 ways I could trade this (let's not get into advanced Harmonic patterns. That's a discussion for another day). Option 1, when coupled with the right convergence of indicators can be a high-probability set up. With the OP's original rules, in order to avoid all the noise, I have concluded that the D1 time frame works best to filter out the tiny, distracting day to day movements. It also allows me to not have to worry about the red news that could potentially wipe out my returns. The downside of this is that it requires even more patience than I am used to, since the entries are far and few between. Still a work in progress, but it seems like good progress is made. Assumptions made: USDJPY, H1, Jan 2011 - Jan 2020, no TP with TS only, SL within Fib levels

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Something that I can't wrap my head around is the seemingly magical use of Fibonacci numbers that is really just a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the most practical sense, the effectiveness appears to mirror any other support / resistance mechanic. What if bounced off the pivot point, or R1, or S1, instead of following the typical "golden ratios"? I can't seem to find evidence that Fibs as a standalone tool would be sufficient. Maybe coupled with other indicators, this could be a good way to trade swings?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I think that it's a self-fulfilling prophecy simply because many trades use it, so it works fine Stay safe &amp; happy weekend

it looks you are out of the author rules? nice trading. so you do not draw fibo from h to LL?

Well as i told before i'm a discretional trader, i don't like so much BLACK BOX. I use indicator to find in the fastest way good areas to trade. About HH-LL, well indicators use HH-LL of swing leg that i use to trade (in my case , previous one )

Hello MQLTrade! I also use depth 24 with all my zz tests. But looking at this your trade I hesitate - do I understand your method right? Attached Image Was it setup for sell? You use range of 61.8-78.6 as a reversal zone. Do you use the same for a breakout? Thank you for your attention!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) As I can see here, price went to 61.8-78.6 zone, then went down - it's a reversal pattern and we look for TP at 38.2, right? Why did you looked for a breakout setup? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
this was a good catch! would you mind sharing a bit about your indicators and method? Obviously this is similar to the OP’s method, but you’ve definitely run away with it. I am curious if they are only specific tf you look for as well as your bias from larger trend. i mean, technically you can keep playing every fib retrace of each fib retrace, but eventually you are on M1. curious how you discern traceable setups vs non-trades

--- 帖子 #261 ---
My trading is easy.....I use metatsock indicators. 1 indicator tells me possible Rev Zone where there is high probability price retrace. Second indicator tells me entry point....nothing special. I don't surf all move mentre. ..i don't like stay in trade so long. I work on 1H e 4h

MQL - thank you again for the consistent posts about this system. I myself am trying to find a manageable strategy for becoming a funded trader. I like and have some success on larger Tf, but most if not all firms that are credible request trades closed on Friday. I have not traded in this manner, and But I think if I adopted this program I could find more regular opportunities with quicker closes. can you provide any insight as to how successful this has been for you? I know your talents will make the largest difference here, but i am simply curious from your time with it if it has been consistently profitable and provides consistent signals. also, I understand your indicator is commercial. Could you at least share the name of the actual indicator so I could search and purchase for myself? i have no problem supporting code creators when they provide such valuable tech.

Is there any reason that you don’t target full measures moves? ie it looks like you’ll take a 61.8 about 2/3 of the way back down the current leg. Just curious if there are times you set your PT to match the initial impulse leg or if you always keep the PT so short

hi, can you tell us about your strategy? i think this is not the original strategy on this thread

--- 帖子 #329 ---
It's the same approach the only different that i use a tool to search faster good opportunities based on ZigZag &amp; Fibonacci retrace ZigZag is the core to find the swing to trade and Fibonacci tells where to close.....so easy

--- 帖子 #330 ---
ZZ is The Best! I hope you will find a way to understand her and trade her for whatever the profit! I hope this tread won't end up as all others ZZ related treads usually end... Wish you best of luck! p.s. to avoid empty wording only, here is an example ( Post 461 ) of what ZZ is really capable of. ZZ is simply INSANE! And this is ZZ in M1. To confuse you a little. Please, don't ask any questions, I won't answer anything. Just supporting your ZZ endeavours, research and findings. There is something absolutely special about her. Just mind-blowing.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
GA.....i see this too late.....

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yeah ZZ is a great tool...but many traders hate it.....the most important thing is to know how it works.....so to take ggod tools that it can give to trader

If u set LEG 2 or greater it doesn't repaint, in this way indicator plot signals based on completed swing, so impossible to repaint I choose this indicator for this reason: onther ones repaint, and it's impossible to trade with repaint indicator

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Thank you Helioss, can you help me link address, so sorry i can't find them.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thanks Helioss, i found it. (ABCD auto detector )

--- 帖子 #417 ---
A swing is made by many LEGs (UP &amp; DOWN), only Leg1 repaint, other ones can not be change

--- 帖子 #418 ---
i couldnt find free indicators that could serve the purpose,so i use 2 fibs to see previous leg and present fib reversal zones. 1.i use quick fib,this indicator is awesome,it gives red or green color ,this gives bigger picture ,default depth is 24 -48 2.i use fibonacci golden zone,this is an awesome indcator,it gives fib zone % for present leg or can change depth. please find both indcators from ffx forums.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
GU tp hit Nice new signal on AU

--- 帖子 #454 ---
AU TP

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Really a great system bro abcd swing waves and golden fibo retracement for potential rejection area 61.8-78 or it can be a continuation if pass through that zone, I usually use on gold everyday for H1 now fib 61-78 area 1814.63-1816.90 seems a good place to short gold edit: and my tp is usually current fib 50, my long just hit tp now waiting whether gold PA will go to long or short zone for next action edit: I just shorted 1814.4 small pips only tp plan on fib 23 or lock sl on 23 and move tp to fib 38, scalping M15 an harmonic bearish also, small pips because still Asia session, waiting real trading on Euro session

--- 帖子 #456 ---
M30 seems rejection by golden fib n might be a bearish gartley there, but always know where to cut loss

--- 帖子 #457 ---
hit tp, actually it can hit fib 38 n 50 as my experience if rejected by golden 61.8 usually significant, but my tp is only small

--- 帖子 #458 ---
AJ H4 up wave rejection by golden fib prev down wave, sl when confirmed break up prev high since I can be wrong too edit: cut it, waiting too long I feel not good, better find another pair

--- 帖子 #459 ---

--- 帖子 #465 ---
how to load the this indicator

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I think it is a commercial product, bro Helioss might know where to purchase it, I saw it but forgot where prob you can search on commercial content, it seems really a good system I know the concept as I use the same systems too, it use waves ABCD and give attention on each golden area, start from fib 50, 68.1 to 78 for good retracement and if passthrough the golden area it means a continuation

--- 帖子 #467 ---

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hey Helios, glad you're having success with the indicator! I recently got it as well and was wondering if you could help me on how to use it? Like what settings do you use for each indicator and what are your general entry points and targets for each trade? Any help would be appreciated, thank you!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I use only fibo_analysis. I don't use it as a black box, but it is so useful to find area to trade. As trend filter i use ADX. This is my setting

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Ahh ok, so you use the fibo analysis to find to find the s/r and take the trade if the adx supports it?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Perfect movement on AUDUSD..... @jra1295: as u can see on this example AUDUSD was SHORT, fibo_analysis indicator show me the potential reversal area of pullback.....quotes went exactly into Yellow Area and then went down according with trend. So powerful

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Ger30: trend SHORT, pullback done, i'm expecting 15670

--- 帖子 #484 ---
15670 Done

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Ok thanks Helioss, I'll try out that indicator combo then. Also, do what SL &amp; R:R do you usually aim for? And what are you looking for in the ToR indicator to make a trade?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Abiti SL i use usually indicator advise. RR i don't see It. Tor show the trend: midterm h4&amp; D1....short term &lt; h4 tf Buy this Is my way, try indicator and First of all learn how It works.

Hi! On the code base, in the Russian section, there is an open source indicator and a script from Eugene (2011-Mar-14). https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/10170 It marks the reversal fibo zones for two impulses: the main one and the corrective one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Indicators are a good tool, but their analysis can be crude. Not every zig-zag can correctly display the wave pattern. And the devil is in the details. This is a manual markup. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Use a simple rule of thumb: always analyze the first swings from important extremes. Even, at first glance, insignificant. A swing of 3-4 bars on the H1 zigzag may not be noticed, but this is 3-4 trading hours! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Helioss Im assuming when you get an entry like EURCAD, you then check the ADX to see if the trend matches the entry? Do you look at any other ADX timeframe or just the timeframe your on?

EURUSD breakout &amp; TP

--- 帖子 #611 ---
We can work on even improved version of it - MTF dashboard with alerts comes to mind.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
The big problem with ABCD Auto Detector is that it does not have the alerts. I have it and I do not use it because many signals are lost. The creator has said a long time ago that he is working on a dash and alerts, but it does not finish

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Yeah. It may not be easy for him . Meanwhile I was talking about the fib zigzig indicator I uploaded which can suffice- an MTF dashboard with alert for it.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I'm waiting dashboard too....at moment i have opened many charts. I'm using TF 30-60-240 &amp; Daily, so for me it's simple see chart &amp; set pending orders I hope dashboard will be available soon

I don't understand, my highest price friday afternoon is 76,237 (not 76,365)

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi! High/Loe swing Is the same?? Different brokers have different prices....so often there are little differenze on entry point. I'm using Activetrades

--- 帖子 #674 ---
My high of swing is 76,78, low 75.972, so they look similar. After the low I have high just 76,237, so this is difference of 13 pips... that's a lot

--- 帖子 #675 ---
This is my last H1 friday bar on NJ...max 76.386 On the end of Friday volatility is bigger and maybe this is why different brokers very often have different prices

Hi Helioss, I saw the thread has change from zigzag and fibo to use ABCD auto detector indicator. My question, is it same concept ? can we still use zigzag and fibo ? if you can mention the price of ABCD auto detector price ? and, why there is a subscription date on the indicator ? thanks

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Yes it is the same just i see that breakout signals are more easy to manage. It is a commercial indicator, you can find author tread into Commercial Section ForexFactory Forum Fibonacci is useful for retracement but also for extension
