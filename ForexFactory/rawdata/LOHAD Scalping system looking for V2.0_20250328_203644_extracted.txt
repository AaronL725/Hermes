PLEASE GO TO PAGE #31 / POST #452 FOR UPDATED MATERIALS AND TEMPLATES. LOHAD STRIPPED 04-02-09 Please See Page #37, Posts #554, #555 LOHAD CHAT: http://lohadscalping.tk THANKS - LOHAD REVISED SETUP: Lohad Scalping "Base" Finally I was able to complete the latest version of this system that I have been using to date (03-16-09) Attached is a zip folder with the template and indicators that I am using. Also I am attaching a document explaining how I trade this system with screen shots and descriptions. Please take a look and feel free to adapt this system to your liking. Lohad Scalping Chat Room: http://www.chatzy.com/644381729943 . You will need to register but it is free. The room is called Lohad Scalping Good Trading to All! Thanks for all your input! Lohad ORIGINAL POST Hey Traders, I am posting the "core" of my system that I have been using live for the last few weeks. My trading partner and myself do use other indicators as well, that I have intentionally left off (for now). The set of indicators that I am posting are the core combination that we use to mainly give us the indication on making a trade or not. I will post the additional indicators on here if requested. The reason I am leaving these other indi's out is because we would like to throw this out there and let it run the gaunlet of other traders to see if there are any improvements or different ideas that we can implement to make this a better system. Even though this has been a profitable system for me (weekly pip count 606,282 and 359). I believe things can always be improved. Now I use this on a 1M chart. My partner works on 5M chart and above. This is intended to be a scalping system. I know people will get here and tell me I'm nuts and quite frankly I see and understand there point of views but for my mentality, this TF works best for me. I have not tried this on anything over 15M but it appears it could be good on longer TF. I only trade the EURUSD pair. My partner trades this on GPBUSD, EURUSD and USDCHF. I have no set SL amount. Basically I use PA to determine if I should get out. I set my trade to get a 5-10 pip TP, and I am looking for an improvement on not leaving too much on the table. My partner does not use a TP. He takes what the trade will give him. I will admit, a better exit is one of the things I am looking for. The Chart: I use the following indi's on my setup: Bollinger Bands - Default Settings PSAR - Default Settings Hull - (Posted) Default Settings BB Macd - (Posted) 12,26,9,1.0 Entry: I have included a picture with a sequential setup descriptions on how I make trade decisions. This picture will show the ideal setup. There are other setups that I will take that do not meet these steps all at once, but I only do that once I have the feel of the market. Basically I look for a PSAR dot to appear OUTSIDE of the BB, I wait for price to cross the HULL and the "kingpin" I wait for the BB Macd dot to appear on the outside of the line. Please feel free to take a look at this. Kick it around. And any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks, Lohad

Hi Lohad, Thank you for your system for scalping Method. Will try your system.... Peace......

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Cool! Let's see if we can work on this. If you happen to see something or find an improvement. Please let us know. It is an open canvas! Also any EA's are worth looking into for all of thos programmers out there. Lohad

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi Lohad, do your trader partner use the same settings for higher TF? I saw "Ronal Raygun" pop up here...I smell the EA is round the corner.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Aurorau, My partner uses the same settings as I do. TO be honest we have tried different settings on the higher time frames. It is not that we haven't put the work into coming up with this system, but we just put these on the board and they seem to work. But if different settings work better on hight time frames, then we should really look into it. That would be great if RR was willing to take a look into it. I have never dealt with him personally (mainly been a lurker here) but I have followed his work and I respect his stuff. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #6 ---
ooops! We have NOT tried different settings. Sorry Lohad

--- 帖子 #7 ---
could you use par sar as exit? i see sometimes the move ends at the other side of the bb, but sometimes goes further

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Blanca, I was using that as an indicator for exit, and it is a good one. But I don't know if greed gets the best of me, but sometimes (especially a strong move) the opposite PAR comes after a retrace and we leave pips on the table. I know I shouldn't be greedy, but just wondering if we can come up with something to get the most of those screamers. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #9 ---
hi LOHAD Thanks for posting your system. As you mentioned you left some indicators behind intentionally i guess u should share those with us to use it as a full functional system.. and give u full evaluation.. would love to see the full verison of it My opition u can use MACD / RSI / STCOH Divergence toger with this system Cheers

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi Hoichoi, Yes I can post the remaining indi's if you would like. I must warn you that it will make the screen "busy" and I was worried about posting these, because I do not want to turn off any potential traders. But with that being said, I will post with a new screen shot, indi's and template. These additional indi's are mainly for confirmation from my point of view, and it allows me to make the a decision rather quickly. If people tend to find the additional tools seem to slow them down, then by all means, do not use them. The original post is what I consider the core for my trade initiation. My partner does use the Macd, and RSI (8) instead of these other indi's that I use, for his 5M trading. I also found what I feel is a new powerful indicator, as it got me pretty excited that it kept me up through the night running through the simulator and it has given me some pretty good setups. I am still running this simulator and take this with a grain of salt because it has only a few hours of run time on the simulator, so I would not consider it fully tested. This new indicator that I found was designed for another particular system here on FF and I wouldn't feel right posting it until I have his permission. Once I figure out how to PM, I will ask to see if it is ok. Albeit I have found these other indi' from other threads.This new one is relevant to new popular system on FF and I do not want snipe even if this is another thread. I will post the new info shortly. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Alright, I am posting my complete file that I use. As mentioned earlier, this I am sure will look messy to some. I have no reason as to why I use them, other then it puts me in the zone and with the risk of sounding corny " It make me feel one with market", and it has given me the upmost confidence to date to scalp the way I do. There may need to be two posts to have the complete system posted.... so here it goes. Complete System Indis: Bollinger Bands - Default Settings PSAR - Default Settings Hull - (Already Posted) Default Settings BB Macd - (Already Posted) 12,26,9,1.0 ADDITIONAL INDI's Rainbow 9 Rainbow 10 (Click "Chart on Foreground in Chart Properties RSI Triple Hull (with ITrend Indicator, Inlayed) - Default Settings Macdgoodone (FXSniper Ergodic with trigger, Inlayed) - Erogodic Settings: 2,10,5,3 Alright... Let me have it!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
...... More attachments

--- 帖子 #13 ---
On the Itrend indi, I made the green line black so it is not seen on my screen.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Thanks for posting the full system btw did u also post the indicator u found out good i guess that is the rainbow indicator right? I'v been using that indicator and it is giving very good result.. let me know if i am correct or not Btw I'll try out this system with 1m and 5m tf cheers

--- 帖子 #15 ---
hii can you explain your system a bit more with the new indicators? also did u try any divergence indicator to play with?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
and one last imp ques.. which indicator u use to exit and how do u filter out the sideways market? thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
No I have not posted the other indicator that I was playing with last night. Once I get permisson from the programmer, I will post it. Let me know if you have any issues when you try this system. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I pay attention to the crosses of the Ergodic (Red and Blue Lines) and the lines from the MACD. This is one method I use for an exit when the cross happens when I initiate the trade (continuation of a trend, the first cross may not always happen) and when the second cross happens, I have been known to use that as an exit. I also use the RSI Triple Hull and the red Itrend line the same way. The two lines (purple and white) cross most of the time in steps which gives me warning. I have not played with the divergence indicator. The one I have does not work properly in my opinion, I will need to look for a better divergence tool before I can play with it. Thanks for the interest! Lohad

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Exits, mainly feel for the market, or sometimes the Macd and Ergodic cross as I explained earlier. Or a lot of the times I use a 5-10 TP deoending onthe market. I use price action and the BBands for sideways market. I am looking for a better strategy foir sideways markets and exits. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #20 ---
hi lohad sure I'll try ur system btw can u pm me the indicator u r using to test it.. if its not a big prob.. thanks

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Well looks worth to give it a try and do some backtest and forward test. Can you clarify how long have you been using this method? Is it 3 weeks? You posted another method a month ago which seems to be different from this at FF a month ago called BOSS scalping method. Just want to make sure people understand that the method is still under test if you have used it only for couple of weeks.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
ffbk, Thanks for giving this a spin. Yes I have only been using this system live for 3 weeks. The other system I posted also did somewhat well, but this one seems to be working better for me. So yes, by no means am I saying this is fully field tested. Just a system that has given me good results for the last three weeks and looking to improve on it. Thanks for the interest. Lohad

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sure, will try it out once market opens...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Sounds good. I hope it works well for you. Hey if you have another tool or theory that we can implement to this, please feel free to share. Anything we can do to increase the pip mileage on this would be greatly aprreciated. Looking forward to your thoughts on this. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #25 ---
i following your system,in fact i am working out some thing like this.please try along with stochastics(16,3,3)adx (16) stochastic levels 95,70,40,5 95,5 are exit ranges for stochastics, entry ranges 70, 40 for stochastics adx 25 trend confirmation.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
please post other indicators also

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I will throw those up there and run through the simulator. I am very comforatable with the Stochs and I have used them on every system except this one. I do have a pretty neat stoch that is actually on the main screen with the candles. I do not use it (even too busy for me) but if anyone wants it, I will post it. My partner is a big fan of the ADX. I found it to be too jumpy on 1M but I never tried your ADX setting so I will take a look. I have been working on this other indicator that I have eluded to previously but I am still waiting to hear from the creator of it to see if I can post it. It was recently released on a new and popular thread for another system and I just don't want to snipe his indi. I have been running this indi through the simulator mill and I think it can be really powerfull in short term TF but I think it might be some tweaking. If I can post this up here, maybe there are some programmers that can work on it. Thanks for the interest drbsprasad. Look forward to your comments. Maybe you can share on here the similar system you are working on. That would be great. All of the other indicators I am working on have been posted here in this thread. Maybe I should zip them in one location. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #28 ---
hi lohad is it possible for you to post the stoch indicator that actuailly can but put in the chart rather the subgraph? also which new system indicator you have been testing? thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hoichoi, I am posting the on screen stoch. The other indicator, I think is going to need some tweaking, but if this can be done, I think woud be pretty powerfull. I am still waiting to hear if I can post it or not. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Lohad what's the name of that 'other' indicator your waiting on? thx, todd

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Todd, I do not feel right giving the naming the indicator yet. I am still waiting to hear from them as to whether I can post this on this thread or not. I have been contacted by the creator and he is considering it and he will let me know. I do not want to appear that I am holding out on you guys. But this indi that I am referring is pretty new for a popular system on FF and I do not want to snipe his work. Also if I was to send this out to the thread, we would still need to rely on someone to modify it I think because this was developed for a higher time frame and after hours of simulator this weekend, I see that it does give really good indications and some that are false indications and I believe it is because of the different time frame that this was programmed for. I will let you know once I hear from him. Thanks for the interest! Lohad

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Lohad I have looking at your system and I am usually the one here at FFactory who cuts up peoples systems but I give your system a #1 AAA+++ Keep up the good work... I really like your BB MACD indicator can you post the source code please? All you posted was the Ex4 file. Go ahead and take a look at the setup we just had for a 45 pip ride! Oh ya gotta like it!!! Cheers!!! PS - I have seen only 3 other trades since the UK open... Awesome bro!!!

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Dear friend, i like your system &amp; i want to know where you put your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Soeasy! Sweet! I m glad others are having some success with this system. I really like your template. The only thing I have is the Ex4 file. I know I have the other file. Just need ot find it. I do have a version 1.03 with both files, but it is a little different. I can post it if you want it. Thanks for the kind words. Let me know. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Piplover, Thanks for stopping by! I really have no hard stop for this system typically, I will refer to the following exits: Price Action - S/R Lines Opposing PSAR dot coming into view Bollinger Band Switch on BB Macd. Thank you for the interest in this system! Lohad

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hey Lohad... I think your system is complete with the 3 indiactors... if you start to add more and more the screen will start to look like a XMAS TREE and it will distort your vision to see the actual setups. I am referring to the RAINBOW and I Trend ect... I am sticking with the original 3 as I like it simple... KISS bro!! Keep it simply simple! soeasy69 I will post my template for you...

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Soeasy, I tend to agree with you. I am going to run your template side by side with mine. Let's see how it goes. Thanks for the template.! Stuck in this nasty little range right about now, but just tappig it for 5 here and 5 there. Go get them pips soeasy! Lohad

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Soeasy, Did you happen to catch the re-entry on the long that you grabbed? This isone situation where the PSAR does not open outside the BB, but you just let the BB Macd guide you on pulling the trigger. I didn't catch it, I was away. But I bagged 34 so far today. Price action just seems strange to me today. Have a good one. Lohad

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Lohad Just want to share this mq4 file of BB Macd. I tend to agree with Soeasy, keep your setup simple. For testing purposes, I attach to the chart QQE indicator. Lime color (SF5) and Red (SF20) cheers, ~profi~

--- 帖子 #40 ---
hi lohad any news about the new indicator? cheers

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks Profi! Maybe soeasy can do some tweaking on it. I agree as well . I have been running his template next to mine. Watching his, using mine just as confirmation (weening of my mess) and managing the trade on his template. I can see clearly now the rain has gone! I love the QQE indi. However I do not have your version. Do you mind posting it? Thanks for the help! Lohad

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I try to do 1 or 2 but no more than 3 trades when scalping because you can get over excited about it and lose in the end... Cheers!!! soeasy69 Hey Lohad we got the source code now... cool!!!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hoichoi, I got a message from the creator, and at this time he is not interested to widen the exposure of his indicator. Which I can understand. He is busy tweaking it for his own system. Maybe there is a possibility down the road when he is not as busy. There needs to be some tweaking. It is designed for a higher TF and I think it is making it jumpy on the 1M and 5M (mainly 1M). However the valid signals were really strong ones. We will see. I would suggest using what Soeasy, Profi and now I am using. It is killing today! Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Quick scalp for EU Here the QQE version I use. This indicator will need QQE Alert MTF v5. Please make sure you have both the indicator in folder /expert/indicator.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Now we have the source cose and I like the different colored lines in the actual BBMACD... cool and thanks for posting the source code... Soeasy69... Trust me when you have 1 or 2 or 3 at the most confirming a price direction with success there is no need to add anymore you'll just confuse yourself into doing the wrong trade at the wrong time... KISS guys... PSar, BB MACD and Bollinger Band will do the trick!!!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I hear ya! Do you think there are some inhancements that can be made on the BB Macd? Later!, Lohad

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks for the indi. Nice trade. I can say that because I hit the same bar as well! Go get em man! Lohad

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Most welcome Soeasy69

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Most welcome Lohad. I just took the trade on my demo. Already fill my book with GU today.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hey Lohad and Profi... The 1 thing I have noticed is when the dot opens below the line on the BBMACD I noticed that if it's broke free from the line and not kissing it this seems to let you know how strong the move is... a big candle usually appears when this happens... when you have a dot that opens on the other side of the line but is still close to the line or even partly still on the wrong side of the line this tells you the start of this move is weak... I hope you follow me here but I will post a picture for you guys to see... other than this guys I don't know how to imporve this BB MACD I think it's doing a great job as it is... Trust me to find something that works on the M1 TF is no EASY TASK!!!!!!!!!!! When I first saw this I said oh no not onther M1 Scalper... but I could quickly see the potencial in it so I did a visual back test of 2 months and it does work nicely if you trade at the right time of the day or night and what I like most about it is it gives just a few trades a day... today there is like 4 or 5 setups that I see... I'll post that picture now and I hope you guys can see what I see... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Soeay, Thanks for pointing that out. I see exactly what you mean. It's almost like a sign of what is more then likely to happen. Man I am glad I posted this on here! Thanks again! Lohad

--- 帖子 #52 ---
You got it right Soeasy. I have been playing with BB Macd for quite some times. I attach here a pdf file on how to use BB Macd to the fullest potential.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
If you could post that PDF, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hey there... Yes I have been starring at charts for a long time now... and I quickly see tiny little things like this... Just in case you're wondering ... most indicators are basically a moving average... MACD is just that... sma and ema are great tools guys... 50 21 are 2 of the most used... if you want to trade with the trend simply put a 21 and 50 on your chart on the M15 and if price is above both moving averages then only take buy trades... if price is below them then only take sell trades... This will eliminate trades but you can never come back at the end of your day and say dam I lost on that trade and I was trading against the trend...Just so you know... soeasy69... I am done for the day... let's see what Tuesday will bring us...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I had a friend who listened to this guy for 3 days about this NexGen and they wanted him to pay them $5,000 did you pay them or did you get this from somewhere for free? Buy or beware folks there is no secrets to trading other than to try and implement something on your own like this setup we are using... All these guys/companies want is our money... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I got it free from this forum. I cant remember from which thread I got it. Maybe I should remove the pdf. What you think?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
yes Make sure Lohad gets it and remove it... it sure does go into great detail about this BB MACD indicator... I never even heard of it until Friday... lol... I do like it thanks guys for sharing... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #58 ---
You are most welcome Soeasy. I will remove the pdf shortly before Im off for tonight. Its kinda late here. Would like to be ready for Tokyo session.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
it seems to be me and you and Lohad in here at best... oh well as long as it works ... Where you from Profi? I am from Canada... soeasy69... Asia session is tricky to trade I stay awaay from it... gbpjpy moves nicely sometimes... but the eurusd is a gamble... take crae...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Profi! PM! The eagle has left the nest and landed!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Yeah I usually end my day around this time. Sometimes, I will look to see what is moving when hong kong opens but not looking to trade. My partner tends to trade GU 5M. But he has ice in his veins. I do hear that sometimes the AUSUSD roars but I do not know that pair well so I stay away. Usually on from 2:00 AM CST to right about know. Then lurking FF at night. Have a good one guys! Lohad

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Cool! That pdf sure does explain that BB MACD well... thanks... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi LOHAN ! I'm new here in this thread, I think it must arouse interest in the reader. After your discussion with soeasy I can see your template much more clearly arranged. So it seems to me its time for completly summarizing the rules, may be in a pdf - as it is usual done in the FF.com-threads discribing a new method. May be you could do it ?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Mandl2007, I think that is a good idea. I will try to get this done as soon as possible. For now if you take a look at Soeasy's last post, it describes a "text book: entry. I will be using Soasy's template (posted earlier in this thread) from now on (with the addition of the QQE that Profi posted). But I think Soeasy's template is the way to start out. If you want to add an indi or two that would be up to you. But is a lot clearer without all of the crap I had on it. But to paraphrase before the PDF file comes out; the best entries are as follows: Short Move 1: PSar dot starts on top and out side the upper Bollinger Band 2: Price cuts down through the Hull 3: Red dot switches to the outside bottom of the line on the BB Macd. Exits Strategy (for now) 1: Dot on Psar reverses (Could leave some pips on the table) 2: Dot Crosses over to the other side of the BB Macd 3: Bollenger Band Exit 4: Price crosses the Hull 5: Descretionary TP 6: Price Action Stops: Use at your own descretion. I have no set stops, just price action (S/R) I think with the help from everyone here so far, we have a pretty solid scalping system working. I think exits are the toughest things to solidify to ensure we get the most out of the move without leaving alot of pips on the table. I will try to summarize this rant onto a PDF. Thanks for checking this out! If you have any suggestions, please throw it out there. Lohad

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Turning off the computer for the night guys. Pretty good day. I netted 61 pips today. Could have been more, I left some pips on the table, but I can't complain about profit. I will try to get the insturction manual put together as soon as possible, but it will take a lower priority then trading. Since we are only on page 5 on this thread it will be easy for any one to catch up. Soeasy, if you don't mind I am going to use your template as the "baseline" setup for this PDF that I am going to make. And I will include mine that has the QQE from Profi included. But believe me, simple is better on this on. Just take a look on page 1 of my system with all of the garbage that I had on my screen. This cleaner set up is about as refreshing as a cold beer after a hard days work. Speaking of that cold beer...... better go! Good luck on the asian market tonight. Go get em! Lohad

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hey Lohad... No probs with the template... I like blue candles with red... I also like to color cordinate my indicators as much as possible so you see blue blue blue = BUY!!! RED RED RED = Sell!!! Me I stay away from the Asia session... too unpredicatble... UK ans US rock!!! Back in the good old days only the UK rocked the house... As far as exits that's one of the hardest things a trader can face is when to take it! Like they say: "If You Don't Take It The Market Will!" The one good thing we have is the plan to get in and that's way better than an exit plan... Like they say "Plan The Trade Trade The Plan!" Also I want to stress that S&amp;R is your best SL and you best entry is to go short after a nice run up of 50 to 100 and to go long after a nice run down after 50 to 100... The best setups happen after a good run ... take today for example... we came down 170 pips then we retarced back up 80 real quick... please see picture... ttyl guys... So where are you from Lohad...if you don't mind me asking? You said something abouit CST... You live in the mid USA? I live in the EST of Canada... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Peace... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #68 ---
This is where those sma's come in handy to not trade against the trend but then again you'll misss a lot of setups...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I am from Malaysia. Sometimes I do trade during Sydney and Tokyo session. During this session I pay more attention on EURJPY. Can expect pretty good moves sometimes. ~profi~

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Lohad n Soeasy I attach here another useful PDF to work with this simple system. This PDF contain info on how to apply 1-2-3 concept together with Bollinger Bands. Hope this will helps you guys to find good and timing entry. Cheers ~profi~

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Another fast scalp on GU Sometimes the PSAR Dot is not outside the BBands. But on this trade, the PA has cross Hull, middle band of Bollinger and BB Macd has given signal crossing level 0.00. Another confirmation, both QQE has cross and QQE SF5 also cross level 50. Exit when the BB Macd first turn to Green.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Another quick 30+ pips on GU

I am live in Wisconsin. Your from the land of good beer. I am from the land of just beer and brats.. Lohad

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Profi, Thanks for the info. This looks relevant for this system. I will read through. Lohad

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Profi, I take setups like this all the time as well. You just need to be in tune with price movement and be ready for things to go angainst you. But is definately a variation of the system that I have made trades on. Good trade! Lohad

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Nice trade and good patience, This is an example of waiting for the perfect set up. Psar did not start out side the BB but then moved outside and just wait for the BB Macd to do it's thing and then we have lift off. Nice trade! Lohad

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Lohad... I sure hope you bags many pips today. Im done trading for today. Thanks for your simple setup. Now its learn and play time for me Cheers ~profi~

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Profi, Thanks buddy! I will try to pick up where you left off. I just got out of a meat grinder of a trade! 52 minutes for 3 pips. I got caught in a range. I will post a picture to a) show a trade gone bad and b) to analyze it to see if we can catch a sign of this. I will post this in a little while. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I have noticed today that after a big run up, you may get a signal for a short. I just took the trade at 10:32 GMT-5 for a 10 pip TP. It hit my target, but trader beware imho. It seems to be choppy in these situations (atleast for today). Technically I could still be in since my SL was set at 2723...... yuo look at her run!!! Left too much on the table. What do you guys think? Happy trading! Lohad

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I am sure you are talking about EURUSD. It looks too choppy for me to trade on that pair. But there are still few good chances for quick scalp. Just need very keen eyes and fast finger to do so.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Yup Profi, EU is what I am on. High Winds = Choppy Water. Gotta float like a butterfly and sting like a bee on this one. Traders beware! I +30 this AM though. So I am hangin in there! Lohad

--- 帖子 #82 ---
All the best Lohad. Go get 'em. I can see those pips coming to you. Get your fingers ready

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Nice movement on EU right now. Sure hope you catch this one Lohad

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I see a lot of setups where the PSar does not go on the outside of the bband and it ends up to be a good trade... oh well what can you do... Yes Lohad Canada is known for good beer but IMHO I like American beer better... I drink Old Mill and I think it's made in Wisconsin... lol... I like it because the taste is clean... all Canadian beer not taste good... they don't filter out the bad smells of Lake Ontario... seriously! The only way for you to tell would be to have 1 side by side and taste them yourself... soeasy69

You use ODL I use IBFX...see the difference... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I can't get that indicator to work properly... I only get 1 line... see? soeasy69

--- 帖子 #87 ---
that is why my friend, QQE do helps in making the decision

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Which QQE are you attach to the chart? Please use MTF_QQE_Arrow_Yannis_Mod v1.1

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I caught part of it, but I had to take my kid to the bus top. So I set a TP of 10 and left it. DAMN DAMN DAMN. Nice move though. Lohad

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I will pick up some Canadian suds today. I will tell the wife that I need to do a taste test tonight!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Soeasy, I had the same issue. Go into the properties of the indi and switch the other color from black to whatever you need. Lohad

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Maybe missing this Pop.mqh file. Copy and paste this file into /experts/include folder.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hey Soeasy, I went back and looked at my entry for that last up move. My Psar was inside like yours. I seen that I had indication on BB Macd and the QQE and by the time I had those the BB started to expand so I took it. Just too bad I did not get to manage it to get more. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks! I will load her up! Lohad

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Your funny Lohad... If the beer is made in the USA you will not be comparing properly... I was in California and I tried some Canadian beer but it was made in California... so not the same... We have a lot of beer in Canada made here like Bud and it taste BAD compared to the American Beer... Back in the days we had a reputation for good beer because it was stronger 5% when you guys made beer 3% now you guys have 5% so turst me Lohad American beer is better now IMHO! I fixed the QQE now... thanks... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Update from that EU trade, potentially can bags 100+ pips provided we follow the ride on TF5min profi

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I hear ya. But the wife doesn't need to know that the test is rigged.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
The Psar is good but it leaves many trades behind when the PSar does not go outside the BBand... Any ideas? Soeasy69

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Drink be marry... lol... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Good now I got that on the chart... it helps... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #101 ---
IMHO, what we have here right now could already helps in making trade decision. PSAR only showing the trend direction. We still need to check on PA movement. That is the major part of the decision making. But if you have better ideas to filter the trade, I would be happy to give it a test. profi

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Soeasy Im afraid you setup QQE incorrectly. Please look the QQE on my chart. Sure it do looks different from yours. Try to download Pop.mqh I had posted earlier. That will do the tricks. profi

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Well put Profi! Also, need to also check higher time frames. I use to use the FXPrime method and it always had me checking on 5M to getter a better view (which worked well). Also, if you look at 30M TF you will see an uptrnd channel and we are at the top of the channel plus we we at a resistance lever (around 2810) if that is broke, next target of resistance at 2894 IMHO. Lohad

--- 帖子 #104 ---
This is how EU currently looks like on TF1 hour. See guys, the setup can be multi timeframes

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I do think this is a big help... thanks... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I guess you attach QQE_Alert_MTFv5 to your chart. The right indicator that you should attach to the chart is MTF_QQE_Arrow_Yannis_Mod v1.1. Both indicator must be in the /expert/indicator folder. But only attach MTF_QQE_Arrow_Yannis_Mod v1.1 to the chart. You could tell the difference between both version by seeing the remark on your top left side of the indicator window. It should be "QQE_MTF (Current Timeframe) xx.xxx xx.xxxx Hope that helps profi p/s Maybe my template could help you

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Yupp when I don't do it it sure does win... soeasy69 PS - Still up 29 for the day though using other strategies...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I didn't take either one of those trades. I was too worried about what I felt was support 2785 area. I wanted to see it broken. Now it has so I will see if we can get any from here. I wanted to take that second one. Man did I , but I froze. That is awesome you are still up though. Lohad

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hey Lohad and Profi... I think that the BB MACD and the QQE will get you in and you can scalp a quick 5 to 10 pips easily! IMHO!!! To wait for the PSar to confirm it will get you in too late and she'll turn on you... I now have removed the PSar to see what I see... Do you guys have any ideas...? soeasy69

--- 帖子 #110 ---
SOeasy, It is funny that you mentioned that. I was working on the same type of thing here. I have been knocking off 5-10 pip trades here not relying on PSar, but the QQE and BB Macd. I am going to look back here tonight and check something out. I think there might be a correlation if steps 1-3 happen within so many bars. The probabilty of the trade is stronger. I dunno just spit balling here. I will check it out. But I agree completely on you point with the BB MAcd and QQE Thanks for the help! Lohad

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hey Lohad, I was trying the method out... using only BB Macd and found it quite useful. Additional items mentioned by you would definitely help. Would be a good idea if we can have an EA for this. It's been only one day since i have been trying. Will keep visiting and keeping you updated.... Bk

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Very true my friend. What we have right now could easily helps us scalp. Another best way is to put higher TF next to the TF that we place our trade. This will help to know where the current trend direction. Who knows you might get yourself in a big PIPS ride profi

--- 帖子 #113 ---
yesterday when you said you were taking 5 here and 6 or 7 there I knew you were not following the PSAr... Because the PSar was not agreeing... So I just took a looksee and sure enough you can scalp a quick 5 to 10 easily without the Psar... What I have found is when the BB and the QQE agree with each other within a few bars it's a good one for sure... Like I said before to trade with the trend all you need is the 21 ema and 50 sma on the M5 and you don't sell into support or buy into resistance... Bye bye Psar!!! soeasy69

--- 帖子 #114 ---
just hit 10 with Soeasy's method! TP hit. didn't want to get too crazy. in between 38and 50 fib level on 5M TF. Could be retrace then another long push before London close? Stay tuned! Lohad

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Exactly Soeasy, I was doing that only after my first entry of 10 TP would be hit then it was obvious we were in a continuation of the trend. Or if we are in an obvious range channel I will attempt to do that. Psar who?!?!? I think we are getting closer to Version 2.0. You guys rock! YEEEEHAAAAAA! Lohad

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I think since this is the M1 we are dealing with 5 to 10 pips is the deal... as you can see the BB and QQE will get you those 5 to 10 quite easily... The PSar was good and yes it was useful but it also lagged... So who showed you this strategy Lohad? Was it your partner in crime? LOL! Do you have Skype Lohad? maybe we can chat sometime... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I meant to say this EURO turns on a dime at any second and this is why the 5 to 10 will work! I trade at Oanda and the euro is .9 of 1 pip to 1.2 of a pip so to get 5 to 10 pips is easy!!! All you need to do ... is to do that 3 to 5 times a day and you be in business!!! Too funny how I came to the same thoughts as you Lohad... cool! soeasy69 There is another startegy in here from a Phillip Nel guy for the M5 it's a good one as well ... so you say you used to slum arounf FX Prime Lohad? me too... I got that thing... sometimes it works and sometimes not... he's selling that on EBay for $97.00... The new latest thing is Vforce it too uses too many lagging indicators... Like I said if you try to use more than 2 or 3 you'll get yourself in trouble...

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Oh yaaaaaaaaaaaaa....

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Could you please drag your trades from trade history on to your chart and post it so we can see your exact entry and exit points? thanks.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Dude hit the same too trades you show on the same bars!!!!!! Freaky! I will get back to the rest of your questions. ...... wait just got the last trade you got on the same entry. Lohad.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Just a thought..... When you are obviously in a uptrend and then it fades away....... DO you think that when BBMacd and QQE (BBQ hehe) cross over the 50 and 0 levels, tht shows " the changing of the gaurd" and signifies trend change? Not sure. I will keep the peepers on it though. That is: BBMacd crosses 0 level QQE crosses 50 Level. Lohad

--- 帖子 #122 ---
My idea, I do not think it will mean a signicant indication of change of direction

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Lohad BB Macd is the same as standard MACD. It is safe for you to wait until it cross level 0.00 for trend confirmation. As for QQE (aka BBQ) it is the same as normal QQE. Cross level 50 just to be safe. Just let QQE SF5 cross 50 and same direction with BB Macd. profi

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Classic set up just happen. I know..... busted by Soeasy, did not get rid of Psar yet..... but maybe instead of relying on that as te 1st indication, it is used as a trade manager AFTER entry being triggered by the other weapons in our arsenal....

--- 帖子 #125 ---
FFBK, Yeah I think we are getting this down. This is why I like the open canvas theory. Get a bunch of traders in here and see what we can do with this thing. So come on in and join the party! As for EA, I never traded with one. I attempted to program a simple one and I failed. Not really a coder. And I like the aspect of watching personally, but I would love to see if someone could write on for this. I would surely try it on Demo. Thanks for the input! Lohad

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I was just looking at that too wondering if we can only sell when below the 50 or 0 line on the BBQ!!! LOL!!! Now that is freaky man!!! soeasy... PS - We need something to say NO to buying now... and No to Selling NOW! ... lets try and find it... Trading with the trend is so critical... this is why traders lose most of the time...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Cool... Just made 15 pips on EU ... I am trying to write an EA for this... Will keep you updated...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Tonight after I am done trading, I will try to illustrate my entries for you. If not tonight, I will get it done asap. As for this manual thing (I mentioned it earlier), I think we need to continue smoothing the true strat out first before we write something op. Thanks! Brandon

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Sweet buddy! Keep us posted. OK gotta get back to trading. It is "shootin fish in a barrell time" I will check back in a few minutes. Lohad

beautiful. The charts are a dream to watch. system works like a charm. how did you come up with this? love the 1 minute for exiting, how about the exiting in stages routine. 1/2 closed at first pop, move stop to open and if it runs hang on.... keep tightening stop... thanks ever so much, having a great time...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Cool, looking forward to it Brandon!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I like EA's I have quite the collection of them... I think that since we are trading on the M1 it's hard to filter out when to buy and when to sell... I guess we'll have to take it by ear... or by eye I should say... Would like to see the EA do it before my eyes though that would be cool... Is he using the PSar too or just the new way we trade it... soeasy69...

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Soeasy, Yup exactly. so I have been tinkering...... Pulled something on the toolbox here. I threw it up there. It is called triangulatMA. Thinking using it in conjuction with the BBands or Hull or both. I will attach, Man I need to clean out my custom indi directory. I don't think the answer with this one is a MA cross theory, but a mere corralation as to whet side price is on. plus BBand trend and the other tools we are working on Lohad

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Just entered short at 16:54 ( i am GMT-5) if price goes higher then my entry bar, I am out. Lohad

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Out +7 Whew! Lohad

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Me I give up by 12:00 EST... I try and do 3 trades max... for scalping... 1 trade if a swing trade... Where you trade at Lohad? Ibfx? Me I like MT4 for charts but I don't trade with any MT4 brokers... I don't trust them... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I trade at IBFX. Not too bad there. There is some slippage sometimes, but seems to be better lately. I usually go till 2:00 CST, but do not really trade too much from noon till 2:00 What method do you use for swing trading? Lohad

--- 帖子 #140 ---
This is like taking candy from a baby... LOL... Soeasy69... I think the PSar is not worth having... the BBQ and the BB work just fine... Have a great day... going outside now and getting away from the pc screen...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I just use those moving averages... the 21 and 50 you look for the turn on them and get in... it's a feel thing I guess... soeasy69...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
If I were you I would run from that place... They slip you then won't let you get out of the gbpjpy ... I hate that place... Where I trade They let you in and out instantly!!! Like I mean lightning FAST EXECUTION!!! No slipping crap!!! The platform sucks but who cares... the spreads are tight in the day time... I have tried out like 5 different FX brokers and I find that Oanda is best... only problem is 50 to 1... but hey if you need more leverage than this your probably over trading in the first place... IMHO... Do you have Skype lohad? soeasy69 soeasy69

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I was looking at that one as well. I was on the phone so I did not take it. Plus I was worried about the center BBand. Nice trade! Lohad

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Yeah I have been hearing that about IBFX, Was it hard ot learn how to chart on MT4 then execute on a different platform? I gotta ask. What is Skype. My son keeps telling me I should get that. Is that some sort of chat service. I ask this knowing I am showing my ignorance Lohad

--- 帖子 #145 ---
HeHe Just missed that 32 pip short. Nice signal too! Lohad

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Where you can chat to someone on a pc with a headset and the sound is better than a land line phone bro... this is what traders use to trade together... If you give me your email I will send you an invatation... then you get a headset and we can chat live... up to you? If you want to let me know... We just missed the big one... sell for 30 or more and fast too...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Soeasy, that sounds great. I will need to pick up a headset first. Can i PM youmy e-mail? Lohad

--- 帖子 #148 ---
What you or me has to do is post our email then quickly remove it... other wise the FFactory mod will remove it... post it here quickly then I will come back and say I got it then you come back quickly and remove it... ok Lohad? soeasy69

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I can do that, but if you have your private massages enabled I can send you a PM with it. Iam not sure if you set up for Private messaging. It is like an e-mail system within FF. Or I can post it as well. Don't matter.

zoom out on 5,15,30M or what have you. Check out the uptrend channel. Going back up or breaking channel? Inquiring minds want to know. This is EU by the way Lohad

--- 帖子 #156 ---
hey guys, just trying to catch up with the latest. i put the QQE on chart, but only get 1 line? Is idea there for a cross for confirmation? Thanks, billy

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Also, it is for all pairs ??

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Stifland, Thanks for jumping in!!!1 On the QQE, go into the properties, then to colors and turn the bottom one to a different color other then black! I have not tried other pairs. I know my partner uses something similar on a 5M mainly on the GBPUSD, but that is it. I have not heard if anyone is using this on any other pairs. I only trade EU Lohad

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Also, Try that "triangulatMA" that I posted earlier. You might like that better then the hull. It is up to you. I just started working with this one. So the jury is still out. Lohad

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Ever get bored? You should mosey on over to the Trading Discussion forum and look for the thread "You know you got it bad when..." There is some funny stuff there. But make sure you come back here!!!! Lohad

--- 帖子 #161 ---
For those who are true 1M scalpers. On the EU is a classic run in which I so affectionatley call "Tap that trend". Plenty of dink and dunk opportunities. Sarted around 19:11 GMT-5. Lohad

Stay out... go eat dinner and have a cold one bro... soeasy69... Did you download Skype yet? awaiting for your Skype invatation?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yup. Hate this time of the day. I shouldn't hate it, I try not to trade this time anyway. Going to get some dinner and start that beer challenge, however it will be biased , I have no canadian suds here. I will get that Skype downloaded tonight. Later guys. I will be back and try to do a day review. I netted 89 pips today. Puts weekly total at 150 even. Lohad

Good job... I took 40... do better in the Am... over and out... have one for me EH! lol

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Dear LOHAD, I see your thread is rising - that's good. Only this day 10/03 you discussed a lot of details here concerning possible changes and new rules ? It seems to me you have made some serious modifications - or you are on the way to them. But now I'm a little bit confused. Is there already a new template ? For instance you considered the possible use of the triangulatMA instead of the hull - and some other changes have been discused. I noticed that discussions of details/problems/observations and possible changes in the following posts: 50, 54, 71, 75, 76, 84, 98, 101, 103, 104, from 109 to 113, 123, 126 and 135. So all that is probably to be mentioned in the manual-pdf or in a FAQ list ? So please - if you have time for it - make a summarize of the actual situation/rules and details. It would be helpful for thankful users. Or - my proposal - use perhaps only the first post every time for actualization of your sytem like some other authors in the FF.com do it in their threads.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
May be you could consider changed parameters for the PSAR - may it would work then better ? To have less lagging ?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Yes it does have IM. You can even put up your own trading room in Skype

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I went searching in my MT4 code and found this old Bollinger Band I hope you guys like it... You can change the colors of the upper and lower band and mid sma too... soeasy69 I better post a picture too...

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Great Thread, thanks for the hard work. I see you are from WI. Me too. What is the latest template? Thanks

--- 帖子 #173 ---
hi lohad thanks for all of your contribution. did u figure out the indi u are trying with ur system is it the triple ma thing? cheers

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Mandl2007, I will try to get an informational PDF posted here tonite. It is 4:40 AM here. I wanted to give this system another day of trading with these changes. Thanks fo your interest. Lohad

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Mandl2007, I just changed the PSar to the following settings, it seems to improve it somewhat. The settings are: Step = .03 Maximum = .02 This seemed to improve things. Also I think instead of making this the leading trigger we look for, we change that to being just a confirmation tool. I have seen instances when you are trying to countertrend trade. If you rely on the PSar first, it could get you in a bad trade. If you are countertrending, you should only look for 5-10 pips on a 1M chart. I did notice on a 5M chart the PSar is more reliable . Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hey Todder, Welcome to the thread. Not sure what part of WI you are from but I am on the West side. This ice storm sucks. Any how I am posting the latest template I am working with today. You will want to make a decision on the Hull and the TriangulatMA. I have both up because I am testing something today. And I have the PSar up. I am trying to clean the chart up though (Soeasy has shown me the lilght on a clean chart) so this may change. My goal is to have something set by the end of the day so we can create a "benchmark" template to where we can work from then we can go from there. Even maybe get someone working on an EA if possible. Thanks for your interest. Please make sure you have the indicators loaded: Hull TriangulateMA QQE - see Profi's posts BBands - Use Soeasy's latest post. BBMacd Check my latest post on the PSar. I changed the setting slightly. I am still trying to decide if I am going to use it though. It is up to you. I will be putting all of this on and updated post (more then like 1st post) tonight. (hopefully). Lohad Lohad

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hey Hoichoi. I will be putting together a summary of the indi's we are using on this system today. If you have any suggestions. Please feel free to let us know. Thanks for stopping by! Lohad

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I didn't know you can setup chat rooms in there. We may have to look nto that once we get things solidified. I have been in a couple of chat rooms but everyone is one different systems and it is scattered. However pretty entertaining. I was playing around with Skype last night and it was pretty cool. Thanks! Lohad

Nice setup on EU 10:08 GMT-5 Gotta get to trading. BBL Lohad!!!!

Great stuff, I'll be checking this out this morning. (I'm Near La Crosse.)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Miss the 100 pip ride but your system is looking fantastic on 5 min instead of 1 min if follow the proper rule we eliminate lots of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Possible bear turn coming. Buyers make sure before going long.

I would say break 2782 to possibly keep the bulls driving

--- 帖子 #184 ---
2811 is a more certain number for bulls imho

I hope you made it out alive? soeasy69.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Big boys did not sucker this sucker. I find on 1M charts when you have 3 large bars like that screaming, there is bound to be a whipsaw. Even it passed my mental target, I knew they were going to pull something. Now to be honest, I was looking for a possible pullback and move forward on up breaking my target. Are you ready for something new? I like to call it the "Lohad Stack" good on 1M and 5M. Same core ( I believe) but looks a little different. Let me know Lohad

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Afternoon Lohad, How does this method differ? Could you provide a screen shot? Thanks much, Cliff

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Okay, As I mentioned at the beginning. I was looking for a Version 2.0. And since this is an open canvas. I am trying not to feel bad when I change gears on ya. But....... I have to atleast send this out to you and give this a whirl. The theme on this is............. SCREW BOLLINGER BANDS. Yeah I said it. J/K you can use em if you still like. Me, I am going to do away with them..... for now. I am about to release after alot of blood (i got a paper cut) sweat (electric blanket was too hot) and tears (stubbed my toe), my new system (born about 3 hours ago) which I so affectionatly call: THE LOHAD STACK Available in both 1M and 5M formats. Why you ask? Well my first system did give us some good entries, but also kept us out of alot good entries like the screamer on the EU this morning. And I have been doing really well on the old system. How was I doing so well on my original system you ask? Well.... I was breaking my own rules. Mainly the PSar on the outside of the BBand rule. Yup rule numero uno. I have been taking trades even if they were inside the BBands. I beg you for your mercy. So I say to myself "how do I stop breaking rule #1 all the time"? Well there is more then one way to skin a cat. The answer was simple. REMOVE THE BOLLINGER BANDS!. Now I do not have to worry about if the PSar is inside or outside of the bands. Great! Easy enough. Out of site out of mind. Hold the phone. I still need a filter. Something to cover my arse. I need a wing man as I troll the scene looking to pick up some pretty pips. This is where the stack comes in. There are 4 things on the chart that make up the stack. for a long stack, you need to have the price above the 250 SMA (50 SMA on 5M chart). Then you have the PSar with Price above both the Hull and the TriangulateMA lines. For shorts, it is the opposite. With price, Hull and TriangulateMA BELOW the 250 SMA (50 SMA on 5M chart). Now you can countertrade trend as price is coming to the 250 SMA but just becareful. We are also keeping the BBMacd and the QQE for confirmation. I will post the template. If you have downloaded everything on ths thread you should aready have the ind's, If you need something let me know. Oh I also changed the PSar as follows: Step = .03 Maximum = .02 Also if the 250SMa (or 50 SMA , 5M) is cutting through the price, be cautious. It could mean a trend change or sideways action. Attached are two pictures of a long and short. I will also attach the templates. Give it a try and let me kow what we need to do from here. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #189 ---
The more I use this MACD BB indi the more I like it. I noticed after viewing the video on it that there are all sorts of ways to put it to use. Price Action on the 1m and 5m charts becomes very manageable. Included a screen shot to high lite a bit of what i am referencing. Self-explanatory. Ciao!for now! Cliff

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Enjoying this thread; thought I'd contribute PSAR that you can change color for both long and short signals as well as the size of the diamonds. Finally, it has an alert. Steve

Hey lohad, how are you? will you please look at the new stack templates something is missing in it.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Good morning gang, Man o Man, missed the move down. I over slept. It is 3:21AM here in Cheddarville. Well let's see....... Got the coffee, got the smoke....... wrote down the news announcements. Have some trading music rockin (I prefer Springsteen)... Let's get to trading. There has been some good opportunities the last day. I wished I got more of the pie, but you know how it goes. I was messing around with the new template. Checking it out versus the other one and also I wasn't quite feeling it. DO you ever have those days were you are just out of sync? So which template do you guys like better? Since it is Thursday, I am going to put together the information over the weekend. Going to get trading the last 2 days. Typically, I am for sure done by noon on Fridays. So if there is anything you guys have questions or comments on what you would like to be included in this information packet. Please let me know and I will see that I include it. Also, if there is any glitches in this system. Seriously guys. Let's kick the tires on this bad boy and point out the weaknesses so we can then look to see if we can improve on it. I really want to work on the "turn" or reversals and exits. Also I think I need to refine the entry scenarios because I see a couple of them. Also check out the trading room that Hoichoi has put together. I was in there last night with Hoichoi and we made a few calls. I normally do not trade the Asian session. I leave that for my partner. But it was a blast. So if you get a chance, check it out. Eventually once the rubber hits the pavement on this system, I will have my partner come on here and explain his trading style with this system. Mainly it is a 5M, Asian Session experience on GU, and he has a little twist on it. So yesterday was net of 48 pips. Was up 63 but closed on a loss of 15. so that puts me at 208 for the week. SO if there are any questions or tweaks you want to express, please post. Thanks, Lohad

Hey Piplover! How's it goin? Can you tell me what your missing? I reloaded the templates on my computer and everythign comes up for me. Let me know what you are having problems with and I will try to figure it out. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hoichoi, Hey buddy, I put that indi u that we chatted about last night. Sometime here, we wil need to discuss. I think I understand what this is doing, but would like to clarify how you use. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hey lohad its goin fantastic In your new templates thread you talkin about two sma(250) &amp; (50) am i right? correct me if i am wrong. so when i upload i only see one sma(50). &amp; there is also problem in your old template when i open my mt4 first time everyday hull repaints so is there any solution for it Thank you for your system

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Piplover, I think I know what is happening. There are two different templates. The one with the 50 SMA is for the 5M TF and then there is one with a 250 SMA. The 250 SMA is for the 1M TF. So if you want to look at both templates, you will need to open (for example) 1 EU chart in a 1M TF and load the Lohad Stack 1M template to that chart. Then open another EU Chart on a 5M TF and attach the Lohad Stack 5M template to that chart. You can tell if you have the right chart by looking in a the 1M TF, the SMA should be 250 and while in the 5M chart, the SMA should be 50. I am thinking of making a background of 1 template different so you can easily tell if you are on the 1M chart or the 5M chart. As far as the hull, I never experienced repainting. I have notice sometimes the Hull will look way out of whack and shooting everywhere. To fix this, just switch the chart to a different time frame and then go back to the original timeframe. Hope this helps. If this did not do the trick, could you please post a screenshot? Thanks, Lohad

Their decision to cut the Libor target range 25bp to 0.00-0.75 percent was leaked yesterday but the big move in the Franc was driven by the SNB's massive Quantitative Easing program involving currency intervention.

Hi, in a trade atm. Will be back shortly. Cliff

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I use the indi's that Lohad has on the 1st page of the thread. Don't use the PSAR ATM. All settings are per default. Many times I'll drop all the indi's off the chart except for the BB's and just look at PA on the different TF's to see where the market is ATM and maybe get an idea of where it might go in the near future. Hope that's of some help. Ciao! for now! Cliff

What a day! I didn't have a chance to trade too much. I had a sick kid at home that I needed ot take care of. Really did not get in the market until late morning. But what a day! How about the afternoon run. perfect entries on both M1 and M5. We'll see how tomorrow is especially after a day like today. Makes me wonder if it is going to be a ranging day. May have to concentrate on getting documantation together or trade M1 scalps. Daily Total = 98 Pips Weekly Total = 306 pips. If there is any questions, please post.

I also got tagged on a false signal. Check out 9:58 GMT-5 It was at the time a countertrend but a hope and a prayer trade that it would bounce of the bottom of an uptrend channel I had based on M5 TF. My fatal flaw???? News. I even had it posted on my moniter and had a mental meltdown and did not realize it. The moral of the story.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hmmmm. Good question. What is helping me is knowing better the strength that the BBMacd has. I would advise everyone to take a minute and watch that video of this indicator. I can't remember what page it is on, but I know it really opened my eyes to the potential of this indicator. First thing, it is Friday. Friday after a pretty volital day. Market is choppy on all TF ATM. So as a scalper I am only taking the trades that I feel the most confidence in. Keeping an eye on PA and higher TF trend is what I have been using today to help keep my feet to the ground. And also, having faith in your system. Which I will be the first to admit, it has been hard to do with all of the tweaking I have been proposing. Well..... I am going to do it to you again. I am posting my template that I have been trading on since yesterday. Nothing to different, but one that I made to just answer my own questions. My belief is, if you are going to be a scalper, and one like me where you trade on M1 TF, you better be 80% successful imho. This means that you need to have a system that: a) is consistantly profitable b) trader has confidence in it Along with knowing the principles of PA and MM to manage your trade. Then when you see a signal, you take it. Plan your trade, trade your plan. However as scalpers you also have to be in tune mentally. If you are not "feeling it" then back away for awhile. Get to know the pair again and try to catch on the wave. Once you have this, you can confidently know what that particular pair is doing. Know I know this is information that you have read and there is nothing to new to learn from these statements. But I am stating this because I went through in inventory of what I am looking for in a system. As I said in Post #1. I am lookin for V2.0. Which means I have a system that has been good for me.... real good. But I am looking to improve on it. Just go take a look at the system I was using. It's rediculus. You know it and I knew it. That is why I wanted "V2.0". Thus all the changes. And I know it is hard to keep up in this thread. For that I apologize. Now I am submitting to you what I feel is as scaled back version of a chart that I am comfortable with. What you want to do with it, is up to you. This is going to be my benchmark template and I will work on it from here to see if this can take us to the next level. I have been using this template on both M1 and M5. It it seems to work on both. My chart consists of the following: 50 SMA Bollinger Bands - Default PSar .03 , .02 TriangulateMA - Default (7,0) BBMacd 12,26,9 QQE - Default I am posting a picture and the template. Basically I use the TriaMA as a "cutter" along with the other indictor triggers we have been working with, EXCEPT the PSar does NOT need to be outside of the BBands as long as you are keen on what PA and trend is doing. I will put my own mental rules on this in 1 file with some of the other options we have been working on this week in a neatly packaged PDF or Word document this weekend. I will get it out as soon as possible, however it is son's birthday this weeked. so I will have to work around the festivities. Also, does everyone have a smulator for practice over the weekend? If not let me know, I can hook ya up. Please let me know what you think. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi All, I was still sawing logs when this set up. I saw that Lohad brought attention to this PA level in his post. Thought I'd just throw out a chart study since I'm not trading on Fridays anyways. Please don't view this as a shoulda-woulda-coulda hindsight sort of thing. The MACD BB's do have a way of getting you into a trade that will minimize your risk along with PA analysis. Now, had this setup failed, risk was only 15 pips. Look at the LL's as the PA follows the lower BB down. Each of those were a failed reversal areas. Fairly easy to see PA momentum change when it moved toward MA/center BB and then continue side ways down. Enjoy the weekend. Finely getting a break in our weather here in the north. Ciao! for now! Cliff

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Lohad, I have found your quest to perfect your method refreshing. Honest in your approach. I think apologies for changes are not necessary. Discarding what doesn't work the way you want it to is the only way to build confidence in the method one trades with. Thanks much. Cliff

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I'd appreciate that, Lohad. I could use the practice. Thanks Much. Cliff "Also, does everyone have a smulator for practice over the weekend? If not let me know, I can hook ya up."

only thing i don't have is the triangulate, it is in here posted somewhere? Also the qqe is not mentioned as a rule on original post. what is its purpose?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Stifland, I will post the TrianulateMA. The QQE is an agreeing indi that I consider when I get a trigger with BBMacd. Sometimes you can get an indication on the BBMacd and it may not be a strong move. A Flat QQE will help point this out. I hope this answers your questions. Let me know if you have any more questions. Thanks, Lohad

Weekend Update. Weekend is here!!!! Crack a cold one everyone. I hope your trading was successful this week. I must say that I really had a great time this week. To everyone that contributed, I just want you to know that I really appreciate it. And even the "lurkers" who are not chatting yet, but are kicking the tires of this method, I hope it was succesful. Even if you guys are not using this system, but getting a piece out of this to help your own systems, I appreciate the time. Well, Platform shut. Today's trading, I was mostly a benchwarmer. The coach did let me get off the pine to score a few pips during garbage time though. My to do list: Finish Documentation for this system to get in all in one spot. I will edit the 1st post when done. I will try to get this done over the weekend. Need to solidify chat room, if people are still open to it. Hoichoi set us up with one. And there were a couple of other ones mentioned. I will check them out. And last but not least. Relax and enjoy the family. Daily Total = 26 pips Weekly Total = 332 pips. What a ride! I will be on from time to time this weekend if anyone wants to chat. Usually I am on early mornings Sat and Sun, and some in throughout the day (whatever I can get away with). If there are any questions, chirp! Have a great weekend and again, thanks for your time this week. Lohad

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Anyone can direct me to the bbmacd video? This trading system is producing very consistent results. Like to visit this thread. Have picked up some really helpful stuff. Very comfortable using the earlier template. (attached) have added 200 sma. Just helps me keep my bearings on trending. Like to switch to higher time frames for reference. If the signals are in the same direction for 1m, 5m and 15m I have more confidence that pullbacks are not reversals. pa moves around the 200 and it proves to be a very strong support/resistance level. I reference several templates to confirm a trade is setting up. And use another platform too. Amazing how different things look on different platforms. Even using the same indicators. I use the other platform (market scope by FXCM ) for daily and weekly pivot points. pa really converges at the pivot points. Highly accurate. Very useful for exiting. About your template, Lohad, I just like to look at it. It is truly a work of art. the color scheme, etc makes it that much easier to look at. Some templates I've tried to use (even if the indicators are decent) are just so unnerving to look at. This one is truly cool...... By using different templates and not trying to put too much on any one chart I avoid clutter and can get different perspectives. If the parabolic is not quite outside the bb on the 1m and therefore doesn't give a clear signal, it may give a clear signal on the 5m and I can consider the 1m pa is slightly correcting but not reversing. I like the sar. If anyone can direct me to the bbmacd video much appreciated....

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Lohad, Sorry about the last post with the alerts. I had originally had additional filters but found that just sticking with the psar and bbmacd were the most consistent. Forgot to take out the code for the additional filters. This should fix any problems. Both files need to be in the indicators folder for it to work.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thanks found the link to the bbmacd video. a must see.... life changing... http://www.nexgent3.com/Flash%20Quiz...o%20Flash.html nexgen home page has another study on use of the bbmacd. a .pdf lot more intricate. gonna take some time to absorb the principles there. http://www.nexgent3.com/file%20uploa...e%20Setups.pdf I always knew there was a mathematical science that could map emotions!!

I only have one monitor so I have to switch back and forth all of the time. And on M1.... well you know how it is. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Skype chat rooms much better Lohad... hey all those pips you made go buy yourself a nice 22 inch wide screen they are only $200.00 I have 2 19 inch screens myself and I find it very useful... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I am actually going to look today. The person that got me into Forex has a real nice, BIG monitor and it works really nice. I do have another monitor that I have that I am thinking about using in tandem. Not sure what I am going to do, use two monitors, or one bigger one. Ok, 1 vote Skype. Speak now or forever hold your peace! Thanks buddy! Lohad

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Trust me you need LCD screens bro... if you use one of those old buggers that sink radiation into your eyes for sure you need a new LCD bro scalping is all about screen starring... don't think about it just do it!!! Yupp Skye all the way dudes... and dudets... hehehe...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Yup the other screen I have is LCD. I just got it not too long ago. Why I haven't set it up, I do not know. Should do it today. So do you suggest 2 screens or 1 big mother? Ok 2 votes Skype. Do I hear 3 can I get a 3..... Hey no fair Soeasy voted twice. Voter fraud?..... Lohad

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hey soeasy. Doing the taste test today. Molsen..... is this a good beer for my international taste test? or Moosehead???? Got the blindfold ready. Lohad

--- 帖子 #304 ---
This way you can waych 2 time frames in a big way to determine the actual trend and this is how you don't trade against the trend... on the M1 there is so many ups and downs and it's very easy to be selling the sucker when it's moving up when you should only be buying... you get my drift I am sure... Ok go get the Vote Fraud Police after me... I am so scarred I am shaking in my boots... lol... soeasy69

--- 帖子 #305 ---
LOL... Molsen is better to try... yupp like wine first smell them then taste them... you'll see that the USA is better... I drank 6 Old Mill last night boy they tatsed good right out of the freezer... I like em cold almost frozen... soeasy69 Old Mill from Wisconsin... they filter out the fishy skunky smells of lake water in Canada they don't this is why I said they smell and taste BAD!!!

lohad how this system performs in slow market condition? jealous to all of you who enjoying great beer in my state its banned

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Piplover, I have been known to trade this system in a slow market. Actually one of my favorite times to trade is when it seems like the market is in a small channel. I am talkin even like a 20-25 pip channel. Sometimes these can get predictable. I do trade this on a M1 chart. but I will do a 5 TP, with a small risk, it does break rules though, RR can be 1:1 which I know is not right, once I get behind in pip win/loss I will quit to wait for the market to get it's act together. but if I come out +15 in the scenario, cool. It is 15 I wouldn't have had before. I wouldn't suggest doing this, it is just one of the things I do. I know your paying spread but I am willing to try it. Lohad.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
NO BEER! Oh I am so sorry dude. I like having a few and then me and my partner can solve all of the PIPworld problems. I am really good at becoming what I call a weekend millionaire. Lohad

--- 帖子 #309 ---
DO you know how many holy grails I have found after a few beers! Then the 4x hangover comes.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
one of the problems i face when trading with this system is data speed i am trading with oanda &amp; i have fxdd metatader. oanda data speed is fast &amp; fxdd data speed is somewhat slow so when market moving fast i will not get executed the price i will see in my fxdd. market is already moving 3 or 4 pips sometimes more. so any solution?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I agree...Skype is the way to go. Cliff

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Lohad, just jumping in and wanted to say thank you for this great system...:-) 7 trades so far (2 days), 6 of them in green... Keep up the excellent work... and happy birthday to your son....:-)

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Piplover, I am not sure. I have never used oanada. Maybe if you were to use this on a higher TF (M5)? But you bring up a good point. Anyone have a solution for our buddy Piplover?!?!?! Lohad

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Skype is running away with it! Thanks CCE! Lohad

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Hey UAFX!! Welcome to the party! I am glad you are having good success with our system here. Can you tell us how you are using this system? TF? Chart Setup? Are you throwing in any new twists that seem to help you? Thanks for jumping in man. I look forward to working with you! Thanks for your interest! Lohad

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Is skype chat room already online ? Where is it ? pjo

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I just trying it on M5 timeframe, mostly EURUSD, some GBPUSD. Trying to be familiar with the system... next week maybe other pairs too... love that BB MACD indi...:-) Have a daytime job, so my daily time is limited for this, mostly in the nights can I spend more time with the charts... European time (GMT+1) I mean...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Wow, Lohad! Cant wait for the chatroom to get started. You have my vote for Skype as well. Looks as if you have a great system happening here with more and more people becoming involved which is what you are after I'm sure. Those 300 odd pips you are pulling every week must be making you heaps of money! Are you wagering a full contract on each trade? I have only just loaded your template and haven't really traded it yet but will do so next week. I did scalp for a fair while up until six months ago but followed a system that basically didn't work. lol. I'm sure this time will be very different and have a great outcome for all. Look forward to joining you on this ex cellent adventure! Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Well Skype it is. I will be setting up a chat room for our system. It will be on skype. Once I figure out how to do this. Any skype pros, if you can point me in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it. Hoichoi, Thank you for taking the initiative in setting up the chat room on mirc, your efforts are not ignored. But it does seem people are more comfortable with Skype. If you know how to do this, your input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hey Dean, Thanks for stopping bye! I am in the process in figuring out how to do a chat room in Skype. I hope you join the conversation. And yes I feel the system we have is good, and I am pleased that we are starting to get more people involved. I will be the first to say that this system is not perfect. But I will put our success rate against any other scalping system anyday. Dean, I am not trading full contracts. 2 months ago, I got caught in an over leveraged, under-capitalised situation with the Martingale system in the most topsy turvey market that I have seen. I took a big hit. Nothing against the Martingale system. I think there is money to be made there. But I got killed on it. SO I got back to my roots.... scalping, and now I have been on the recovery plan and I got it back. I went back to what I know. I no longer care about the 200 pip moves. My goal is 150 pips a week. It puts less pressure on me. Once I learned that you are not going to get rich in an afternoon, it made things at ease for me. Trading has become fun for me again. What it all boils down to is this. If you are aware of PA, S/R and Trend you can make money. But the Holy Grail, do you want to know what it is? Do you really want to know? It is three things.... System = Something you are comfortable an confident with. Money Management = Live to fight another day and long term plan Emotions = You can't have any. Every system will fail (including this one). But accept it, move on and get the next one. When the dust settles and you are on the plus side... it is a good day. Never never revenge trade. It will kill you. Plan your trade, trade your plan. Scalping requires full trust and confidence. I am ranting. Sorry about that. But hey this system may have my name on it, but it is OUR system. I am looking for you help making this a kick butt system. There has already been multiple people in here that has made us money. And I just hope this grows. And I know there are some lurkers who visit our thread here and they have a new twist to make this even better. And I hope they drop in and give their input. And I know there are people that think this system is bunk. And I hope they drop in and express their critism. I am looking for holes in this system. Because only when the weakness is exposed, you will be able to fix it. Thanks for the time. Lohad

--- 帖子 #321 ---
excuse me,the system is useless to me..are you making money??...may you post live calls or broker statement please? good luck

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Vivadaha! Welcome to the show! I am sorry you think the system is useless. Can you please explain why? Please post some screenshots? I will not offer a broker statement. A better question is, will you offer yours? I expect you will not do the same. If the sysem is useless, can you atleast explain why? I would love to see entries that went wrong, so we can see what the scenario was. I welcome critism, but I need to know the basis of the critism. If not, I can't try to troubleshoot. And yes I am making money. And no, I will not be offering live calls. I will be offering what trades I am thinking about taking, but I will not tell you buy now or sell now. Thank you for taking the time to write here! Lohad

--- 帖子 #323 ---
If you use v4 Skype , menu contacts create new group that's it very easy. pjo

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks Lohad. You still must be doing ok though, right? I see some weeks you have made over 600 pips. Is this what you do for a living, that is, FX scalping? Or do you have a "proper" job as well. I gather from what you say you are full time as you have a partner etc. How do you go about having a partnership in this business? Do you share profits or losses etc? Sorry for the questions. LOL. Just trying to get my head around all of this. Also, can you drag some of those trades onto a chart and post the actual trades as it makes it much easier to understand. I dont think you have done this yet have you? Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hey Lohad, Forgot to ask about the money management associated with this system, or how you approach it using this system as you mentioned its one of the three constituents of the holy grail. I think you mentioned you use a "mental" stop loss early on in the thread. How do you employ risk management with a mental stop? Is it in terms of a percentage of your account wagered in any one trade or is it a daily tolerance limit you have? If its a daily tolerance, how many pips are you willing to loose in a session before you call it a day? What risk do you suggest we use with your system? Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Thanks PJO, I think I have a chat room set up in Skype. It is called Lohad Scalping. Please let me know if this is not working. I am a Skype Newbie. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi Dean! Yes I am doing alright. My account is seeing a nice boucne back using this system. I am what I would call a psuedo full time trader. I work as an independent salesman, in the construction industry (Interiors). So if I have a job going, I am typically only trading from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM. But with the economy the way it is, I have been basically trading full time. My partner and I trade on one account. We are both equally vested. We split P/L 50-50 across the board. It is workig out well. Can someone tell me how to drag some trades on the charts. I am not sure how to do that. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hey Dean, Everyone has their own method of money management that they are comfortable with. I do use a mental stop. I do not believe in setting a stop at 10 pips. To me hard stops is nothing but a line in the sand which indicates at that point of time, that it is ok for your broker to take your money. I have seen too many people sit and watch the market turn on them after they made their position. And they watch and watch and watch price go against them and they do not get out becuase it did not hit their stop yet. Listen guys if you get into a position and the market turns on you and you are sure of it. Why hold your trade waiting for your stop to be taken. Get out. And then I seen to often the flip side where stop was too tight, your stop gets hit then the market goes your way and you are left watching. I like to use s/r for my mental stops. If support or resistance has broke there is usually a reason for it. But before I get out, I will check to see if there any divergence going on. So my stops are mental. They could be 5 pips, 10 pips or even 20 pips. Depends on market conditions. If I am scalping a channel, my stops are adjusted to the size of the channel if I am trading a trending market, I will pay attention to Fib levels as well. I do not have any level of loss before I call it the day. What I use is how I am feeling. I do have days where it can be a prime market and I for some reason am not feeling it. If I have three bad calls in row I will step away, watch from the sidelines and make paper trades until I feel I am back in the flow. I hope this answers you questions. These are good questions to ask. Again my plan may not be what you like to implement. What ever you are most comfortable with is the most important thing imho. Lohad

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Lohad, I read all posts on this thread. The system looks very promising. I love BB MACD. Great work! Forexrook

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Lohaad, So basically replaced the Hull with the Triangular MA? Do you guys have a attachment for that.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi Lohad, Thanks for sharing your system with all of us. I have read the thread since Page 1 and there have been various changes in the trading methodology. I am somewhat confused as to the current setup and rules for entry/exit. Could you please post your current template that you are using along with the entry/exit rules as they now stand. I would appreciate it very much. Many Thanks indeed!! Alkis

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Stifland, Yup that is basically what I did. Removed the Hull and use only the TriangulateMA Indi will be posted. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hey Alkis, I am glad you are taking a look at this system. I am just about complete on the consolidated information with the rules that I use. But I will posted the template that I will be working with. Thanks for the interest. Lohad

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Forgot to add the template. Lohad

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi Lohad Thank you for the system, it looks very interesting. I have looked for your group on skype but cannot find it. I think you may have to manually add from your contact list to create group. Not certain on this but that is what it seems. Will be testing this week, looking forward too it. -Ian

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Guys, I have been checking and I think I can get a chat room set up at ircforex. How does this sound. I think it will be alot easier. With Skype, I would need to add everyone manually. Let me know what you think. Lohad

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Hey Ian, Thanks for stopping in and checking this out. If you have any questions, please let me know. Thanks again! Lohad

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Lohad, do you think you could edit the original post as place the current indi's you use along with the tpl? Also, just out of interest, what scalping method were you using in the past as you said you are getting back to your scalping roots. Was it a successful method that made you pips? Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #339 ---
The chat room I am in does allow anybody to join in, so you do not have to worry about adding users to your chat room by yourself. Skype is for everybody and it is easy to use. mIRC is a little difficult for non IT oriented people. pjo

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hey Dean, Yes I am going to be updating VERY shortly post #1. I had the other system that I was using posted, but it never got any interest. I think it is in the recycle bin now. Not sure. But it was based M1. I did do alright on it, but not nearly as good as this system. Lohad

--- 帖子 #341 ---
PJO, I have no problem with Skype, I just cannot figure out how to do it easily without having to add people manually. And I know I can go the ircforex and set up a dedicated room right now. I have been in the #forex chatroom quite a bit it and it seemed fine. But if anyone can walk me through the Skype setup, I have no problem setting this up. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Oh, ok. cool So you have only been scalping for about 6 months. That's a pretty quick turn around time to go pro. You must be very confident in your abilities. Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #343 ---

Hey Lohad, if you are interested here is a link where you can create your own chatroom http://www.chatzy.com + http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;sa...t+room&amp;spell=1 let me know what you think

--- 帖子 #346 ---
thanks for the open honesty, Lohad. so easy to get stressed out of control trading. adrenalin... been reading more about adrenaline and how it is very strong physiological influence. A chemical that once it is set loose into the system has profound affects on thinking and sensual experience. Not a good friend for the trader!!!! A high for sure but not a profit maker. Like a drunk blowing a wad. So developing a good system that I am confident in is essential to keep Mr. Adrenaline away... I want to trade successfully enough to stop the time clock job. Let's go. I hope I am welcome here. I am 62. work nights on a motel check in desk (with wireless access ) so I can trade a bit Asian market and London open if it is slow, but never know when there'll be a walk in or a phone call so have to be careful. Mostly I am following the US market. Live in Tennessee, USA. and oh yes, I am woman. I have been trading and studying for 4 years with not much success, until now. Trying system after system, indicator after indicator, lost a bit of money here and there. Now I am using FXCM micro account. Which is perfect for me. Huge leverage 400:1, but small lots 10,000 and small investment $25 to open. Perfect for learning and scalping. Demo accounts don't carry the same intensity of concentration for me because there is nothing of value on the line for practice trades. But a few real pennies or dollars increases the attention. So that is who I am more or less. Looks like you have the right idea Lohad for building something of a trading community. Thanks for your efforts. I'm a bit of a slow learner but let's go... I'm not giving up. Meena (jiva34) will you keep the tread on forexfactory if you set up skype?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I am happy to walk through with you. Pls install Skype v4 and add my name pjomtfuji. pjo

--- 帖子 #348 ---
HeHe, Yup, I demoed for a for a good 9 months with the person that got me into forex, and like any other aspiring trader, I was killing it on demo, so I thought it was time to go live. Jumped in, got a big draw down built up the account again, doubling it and then I found this cool idea of the martingale system. I thought oh cool basically I will neve be wrong, just keep opening trades. My leverage blew up. I had all kind of trades left open and swap was killing. Closed all of those trades, went back to scalping kicked around another system which evolved into this system and now yes, I am very confident of my abilities scalping this sstem. And that it what I found out. No matter what system anyone uses, you need to be confident. If not you just sit on your thumbs and watch the trade go bye. Also, I do have other duties. I am an independent contractor in the construction industry, but lately there is not much cooking there, so I have been basically doing this a lot more. Hope that answers your questions, Thanks man! Lohad

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Thanks Ian, I will check out today. Lohad

--- 帖子 #350 ---
excuse me Lohad,but there are so many scalping systems..everybody believes in his own system..just live calls can tell if the system is worth watching or not....i wish you would post at least 20 live calls (if possible) cheers

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Of course Jive, You are welcome here. Please keep me posted on how you are doing. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate on asking. I will see if I can offer any answers. And yes, I will keep the thread here on FF. There are too many valuable traders here with a ton of input to offer. Look forward to working with you. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hey Vivadaha, Look man you already said the system is useless to you. And I respect that. There are a ton of systems around that I am sure are good, but useless to me as well. The person I was first working with has a good system.... for him, I couldn't trade it, but he did well on it. I could not be confident in it and it effected my trading. So I needed to find something that I was comfortable with. Scalping can be stressfull enough. I will not worry about your account when I am scalping. If you look back through the thread I have offered some market analysis. I have offered some live analysis to Hoichoi in a chat room. I am not afraid of giving my analysis, but I am not going to sit here and give live calls to tell people to buy now or sell now. Because even if I was right 90% of time, if you are not comfortable with it, you are not going to pull the trigger anyways. I feel like you are wanting me to sway you into believing in my system. And I am not going to do that. If you are uncomfortable with this method, there is nothing I can do about. Even 50 calls will not sway you. I would suggest if you want to put the time into it, watch and follow the system and see if it works for you. If not I understand. I have been there. I have nothing to sell here. I actually posted this system looking for help from my fellow traders. I am not doing this for some ego trip. Thanks again for your interest. But you still haven't answered my question from earlier of wanting to know why this system is useless for you. Maybe you found a hole in it. If so, please bring it to the table so I can see if there is a solution. Instead of coming here is asking me to validate my system to you by telling you how to trade. Lohad

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Did anyone hit this last run up? Let's get em guys! Lohad

--- 帖子 #354 ---
hey lohad two bad signals today

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Piplover. Where were the bad signals? I see it trending nicely. Please let me know. I will look into it. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hey Lohad. How come you are looking to push the original system in another direction? You said your goal was to get 150 pips per week. Before starting the thread the three weeks previous you scored 606, 282 &amp; 359 pips respectively. Last week you harvested 352pips. It seems to me it crazy to want to modify your original system as it was netting you way more pips than you were after anyway. What's the use of putting your system out there and get everyone involved as your system worked fine in the first place as you were beating all your targets? Wouldn't you be better off just trading your system and using it as it was as there was nothing wrong with it? If anything modifying it may reduce your pips and lead you to your goal of 150 pips per week! LOL Also, it is very easy to drag trades to the chart - all you do is go to the account history tab at the bottom of IBFX click on a completed trade and drag it to the chart. Cheers, Dean

--- 帖子 #357 ---
lohad do you set chat room? if yes please post the link here or in your first post

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hey Dean, As I mentioned in my first post. I am looking for a V2.0 because I am having issues with exits. Thanks for telling me how to drag trades on the chart. I have posted a picture of the last trade I just took. You will see what I mean about leaving too much on the table. Also, I posted this system becuase I learned a lot from the other systems on FF and I just wanted to show people what has been working for me. And also, I am looking for better ideas on exits. Thanks for the questions, Lohad

Seein bearish Div on M1 Again not sure how reliable Div is on M1

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hey Piplover, I see your picture now. For sime reason it did not show up when I responded earlier. What I see here (again hindsight) is that it was a countertrend situation. The QQE was pretty flat. I almost got into this one as well, but the QQE was too flat for me to trade against the trend. Thanks for posting this though. Lohad

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi All, Have a bit of time at the moment. Thought I'd throw a little study together that is helping me to identify likely trade setups. The pic is self explainitory. I do not use the HULL or QQE. Also, this seems to hold true on higher TF's and other currency pairs as well. Happy trades to all. Ciao! for now! Cliff

This will be posted today. Once I get a break from the trading room. Thanks for your patience everyone! Lohad.

I'm going to make a bread. If I watch this too closely I'll get out prematurely. if it goes as planned +65 pips if it goes against me (wouldn't be the first time) -48... Anyone see anything amiss with this trade. comments very much welcome...

--- 帖子 #376 ---
should have stayed in the kitchen with the bread. got out with 25 pips it'll go for at least 65. oh well. no one ever lost money taking a profit... need to take a break, then come back after a while to look for another trade...

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hey Traders, Finally I was able to post the revised setup with current rules that I use to date, to trade this system. It is posted on Post #1 Also, there is a link on Post #1 for a Lohad Scalping Chat room. You will have to register, but it is free. NOTE!!!!! I will give my market analysis of what I think is going on. But I will not say buy or sell now. I will inform the room of trades after I entered them. Scalping requires concentration and a quick judgement and I will not have time to type in a call before I trade. Lohad Scalping Chat Room: http://www.chatzy.com/644381729943 it is called Lohad Scalping I am feeling pretty sick tonight so I will do my daily update tomorrow morning. Please post if you have any comments or questions. Thanks guys for all of your help. Lohad

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hey piplover, Thanks for checking in. I am feeling a little better. I going to spend some time this morning getting back in the saddle again. Once I feel I am with the market, I will get back on here. I owe two daily updates and I will post some more info. thanks for checking buddy! Lohad

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hi Lohad, I hope you are feeling better and back to making more pips. I just want to thank-you for sharing this great system. Today was my first live day and I am already up 30 pips on the 1 min chart. It is such a easy system to use once you master the BBMacd. MANY THANKS!! I am attaching a Pivot Point Multitimeframe indicator which I find really useful as it shows Daily, Weekly and Monthly Support and Resistance Lines. I hope you and others on this forum find it useful. Many Thanks Alkis

Hey guys! Sorry for being out of loop the last few days. This cold has really kicked my arse the last few days. I feel like I am starting to pull out of it. Basically, I am trading today but a little underground. Trying to shake off the rust and get right. I tried to make a go at it yesterday, but not all mentally there for scalping. Yesterday after a topsy turvy day with me, I finished up +2 with a weekly total of +49. I am going to write something I am sure everyone knows, but I need to bring it to the table. Do NOT trade if you are antsy, or feeling the need you need to catch up. Yesterday I was in the mode, that I needed to catch up to obtain my weekly goal. This was part of the issue of why I had bad trades, more then normal. I was lucky to finish on the plus side. Learn to walk away if you are not feeling it or if you have a sense of desperation in you. This morning I have been trading. And I am intentionally doing this in quite to make sure I can get back into it. I am feeling better mentally and physically. As of now I am up +44 for the day, +93 for the week. Obviously I am not all back together, this should be much more, with the way the market is moving. But I am happy with it so far. Tip for the day: my buddy Soeasy69 has been working with me on the M5 TF. And the biggest thing is trade only with the trend. I am taking a lot less countertrend trades now. I am always aware of what side of the 50sma I am on. I do this both for M1 and M5 TF If I am on top of the 50SMA, only longs are taken, shorts visa-versa. I will check back in latter. Let me know how you guys are doing. Any one hit that monster yesterday? Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #395 ---
hey lohad, nice to see you back man. yesterday's monster i think no one could grab it except news traders because its due to fomc statement.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hey Lohad great system - testing it now on a demo account. Maybe you were TOO sick when you uploaded the files LOL .Unless I am missing something the template is missing following indicators Max_NonLagMA : Acts as a “cutter”. BBMacd: Known as the “Kingpin” of this system. Trade confirmation. Colours refered to in the manual are also different on template - easy changed I know in the individual indicators. Hope I dont come accross as a smart A** in first post - system looks great but if templates wrong could confuse many. Many thanks to all for work. R

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I had my apple a day for the last week. Now lets see if the Doctor will keep away! Feeling like new again. Time to get this back on track. How is everyone doing with this system? Or is anyone still using it? Despite missing most of last week, I was still able to pull off a weekly total of 119 pips. Looking to have a better week. I must say, even though I was feeling like hell, it was somewhat nice to step away from this market a few days. It can tend to clear a guys head. And hey the market will be there when you get back. Well I am back! Pips BEWARE! Lohad

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hey Rob24hrs, Man I put this out to have new users try our system and I can't even put the correct info out. I will fix this this morning. You can, in the time being, get these other tools downloaded in this thread. Thanks for bringing my error to light! Lohad

Nice to see you back in action. i found new tweak. try yourself &amp; tell me its correct or not. change Ma 50 to Ma 20 with same settings. English is not my first language so i will not explain this thing too much but try it &amp; see for yourself &amp; tell me

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hey Piplover! Yeah I am back in action! Feels great! What TF are you changing the MA in? I will check it out! Lohad

--- 帖子 #405 ---
In 1M

--- 帖子 #406 ---
So people are we using maxnonlag ma or triangular ma If Triangular whats the rules? rgds R

--- 帖子 #407 ---
do you edit your first post? will you add indicators that you willl miss last time. will you please put image of your chart with this system. i think i miss also

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Rob, I need to clean up what I released earlier. I am using the Max_NonLagMa instead of the TrianulateMA. The works for both of them, but I like the Non_Lag better for my "cutter". I find it runs closer to price and keeps me in line better for PA. But either one will work. Sorry for the confusion. This will be cleaned up today. Lohad

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Guys, Go to Page #26. On posts #383 and #384. This is what I am using. I have also been playing over the weekend. I little different look, just trying to decide if I like it or not. This morning I am using what is based in the above mentioned posts. I will get this cleaned up and updated on Post #1 today. Lohad

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hiya again, sorry if I am confusing here... Rules state Should it be With the RED MAX _ NonLagMa BELOW the Psar (NonLagMA needs to be red). Ie above for BUY Below for Sell? rgds Rob

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Yup, Long: Psar - on bottom BLUE MaxNonLag - Middle Price - Top (with BBMacd and QQE indications) Short: Psar - on top RED MaxNonLag - Middle Price - on Bottom (with BBMacd and QQE indications) I am updating my document with pictures of long and short entries along wth the rules. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Here are some pics of long and short entry pics. These will be added to the system documentation. Thanks for all your help guys! Lohad

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I've read a couple time that Non_Lag is a "cutter". Does this mean that when this line cuts through price, this is an exit single? Please explain.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hey Skin, Yes, when I refer to the Non_Lag as a "cutter", I mean when price cuts through the left or right of Non_Lag (price being the base of orientation Left = up Right = Down) it could mean a possible exit and a possible entry . I hope this helps. Lohad

--- 帖子 #415 ---
lohad i attach image here which will shows if we use 50 sma as trend filter we miss 12 pip trade. (in orange 50 sma &amp; in dim gray its 20 sma with "right" sign &amp; trade with "Arrow" sign )

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Lohad, Glad you are feeling better now. Just a quick question, when trading off the 1 Min Chart, do you check for trend direction agreement on the 5 &amp; 15 Min Charts to both agree or just the 5 Min Chart? Great system by the way, MANY THANKS for sharing!! Alkis

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hey Alkis, Good question! Yes I Always check the M5 and sometimes M15. I do not particulary care about the M15 because after all I am scalping, but I do keep my eye on the ball with it. If I am trading M5, I always check the M15 and then sometimes M30. All bets are off when countertrend trading. I know full well that I am going against the grain of the higher TF, thus more risk and keep a lower TP amount. Lohad

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hey man! I am glad things are going good for ya! Wht TF are you using? Lohad

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Nice chart!, I do have this up and I will see how it works today. Yes, I can see more oppotunities for trades, but I would consider that last one as a countertrend trade. Whch can be good trades, but be leary could be more risk involved. Thanks for sharing Lohad

--- 帖子 #420 ---
If eveyone will take a look at the M1 TF we look like we got done with an up trend, but look at the M5 at the same time, we are still in a down trend. This I consider a countertrend based on higher TF.

Opening Gap is now closed.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I dont understand what do you want to say In Details please

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Sorry about that. Basically When the market opens on Sundays, there is typically a gap, and typically the market likes to close that gap (not always) it is something I just keep an eye. Mainly thinking out loud. Lohad

--- 帖子 #424 ---
but what that gap do? gap is fills means changing the trend? i am newbie in gap trading. &amp; news is coming

--- 帖子 #425 ---
No it doesn't mean that the trend is changing. The trend could have aready changed by this time. I just pay attention to it, because if there is a large gap, the market will somtimes want to close the gap (price correction?). Not sure really. I am not really a gap trader. I just keep an eye on it. Maybe some people here are gap traders and they can explain better. Thanks

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Lohad, I am trading off 1 Min Chart for a 10 pip TP. Alkis

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Piplover, Check out this link. http://www.investopedia.com/articles...layinggaps.asp It should give you a better idea of the what and why traders consider the GAP when analysing their charts. Hope this helps. Cliff

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Alright! Good to hear! Keep it up buddy!

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Not a problem. learning new things from you everyday. will you trade that last move? i think institutional money is in the market. do you know any kind of software which will tell institutional is coming in the market. &amp; i find another new tweak. there is no need to put sma in the chart if you look whole down move &amp; also see BBmacd its rarely cross zero line means when BBmacd is under the zero only take short trade &amp; up from zero line only take long trade what do you think about that?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
This is what I like to see! Way to go! I better jump back in now news has cleared. I am up 34 this morning. Looking to get more! Lohad

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks cce for the link.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
That article the CCE posted is a good one about Gaps (Thanks Cliff!) I am not a pro at trading gaps, just another thing I have been paying attention to. Never enough knowledge to be had in this industry. I took a quick 5 on the last short. News was coming so I stayed away from the most part. Now it has passed, I am back in the hunt. I am not sure of anything that will show when the big dogs are in. But maybe someone has a tool for that. I am glad you are looking for additional tweaks in this system. I will keep on eye on the BBMacd relationship with the zero line as far has trend analysis. Good point. Thanks for all your work in here! Lohad

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hey piplover! Good call man! From initial review of your detail on the BBMacd, it looks like you are correct. Try looking at this guys! It could help show the way. I will keep an eye on this. Thanks again PL! Lohad

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Don't thank me. Thank you for giving us great scalping system. &amp; BBmacd for support &amp; resistance &amp; if you look this attached image here you find that as per your system all the criteria is right for taking short trade but macd doesnt cross zero line so its become support &amp; after that price is go up. if you look latest down move you see that Bbmacd crosses zero line.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
hello lohad, hello guys, i just wanted to download the zip file of the 1. post. when i downloaded it, it says that the archive is broken. can somebody reupp the zipfile please ? thx, tex

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hey Tex, Thanks for giving this a try. I am sorry for the confusion on this. I will fix this problem today. But Piplover is right (Thanks PL!). Page 26 will give you what you need. Thanks again! Lohad

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi lohad, I'm new to FF. However I been trading live lately with many crap indicators.. and it almost wipe out my account . Now I have to trade demo again (polish or to get a better trading system). came across with this wonderful system and gave it a shot. Now it's +18pips. I'm still not good at this system but i'm learning. Do you enter at (1) or (2)?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hey Sitaringfx! Welcome to the club! I have been there before working on live accounts with systems that produce for others, yet costs me money. Oh no, I feel a rant coming on. I will save that for a different post. Anyhow, I am glad you have decided to come on in and give our system a try. And it is awesome that you are up. I took a look at your picture that you posted and I have a question and I notice something. The question: What time frame are you trading in? I noticed that the BBMacd setting is different then what I use. Can you please re-set the BBMacd to the values of 12,26,9 and re-take the picture so I can analyze it better? Thanks bud! Lohad

--- 帖子 #441 ---
oppps... my mistake, i just load it without looking at the setting. Lohad, i'm trading it at 1M. Is my setting ok?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Nope use the following: 12 26 9 1 Let's see how this looks. Lohad

--- 帖子 #443 ---
sorry, i uploaded the wrong screen hehehee! l edited the attachment now! I'v change it to your setting now, thks!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Cool! Did that change the look of the chart that you sent on your first post?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Lohad, I would like to confirm something with you please. When you look for trend direction on the 5 min chart, do you merely look at price action in relation to 50 SMA or do you check that all indicators agree before taking a trade on 1 min chart? i.e to take a long on 1 min chart, do PSAR need to be below price,NonLagMa above PSAR, blue dot on BBMacd on outside of upper line etc.....on the 5 Min Chart? I hope you understand my question, that all indicators have to agree in 5 min before taking a long trade on 1 Min or do you merely use trend lines on 5 min to determine trend? Many Thanks Alkis

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Yes, it did! Look at the chart now. Much clearer that I should had entered few ticks ahead! Dont know if you have taken this trade!?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Lohad, Sorry, forgot another question. When all conditions are met on 1 min chart and you see dot on BBMacd appear outside of line, do you take that trade then or wait to the close of that candle first? Alkis

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hey Alkis! How did your day of trading go? This is a good question. Well the first thing I do when looking to trade M1 is to look on the M5 chart and see how price is in relation to the 50SMA. Lately I have been only taking trades that are going with the trend. Since M1 is going to bring up a valid entry before M5 will, I do not always wait for my M1 rule conditions to be met on the M5 TF first. What gives me the most confidence in making a trade is when I have my rules met on M1 and on the M5 chart appears to look like it is going to coincide. It is hard to technically explain, but mainly when you see a blue dot on BBMacd and it looks like it going to to go to the upper band, AND all rules conditions on M1 are met, then pull the trigger and watch the fur fly. Also, having a feel of what PA has been doing M1 is needed. Also, there are times when all rules are met on both TF and obviously this is a good signal as well. I use this same process as well when I am trading with M5 TF, but I look up to M15 for my confirmation when I am doing this. Now when doing a countertrend trade, I still look to see what M5 is doing, but I am mainly going off on M1 PA and then I keep a close close watch on it.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Hey Sitaringfx, Thanks for reposting this chart. I am assuming this is EURUSD. I did not take this trade, but if I was looking to take a trade here, I would have done it like you siad, a few bars previously. Now this would have been a trade looking for an outcome of about 5-7 pips when I would have pulled the trigger. The reason I am saying this is, look at the BBands. They look to be narrower, not quite consolodation but they are narrower then before. Now there is another trade entry towards the right of your screen that I would have taken as well, and you can see PA is pushing the upper Bband to expand, this trade has more of a potential to run longer. But IMO you are spotting these correctly. I look forward to working with you on our system.! Thanks for giving us a shot! Lohad

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Alkis, Please don't apologize for asking questions here. It is our job as traders to help each other out and to help better define our system here. The technical answer is yes wait for the the conditions to be met and wait for the candle to close and the next candle to excede the high/low of that candle. But I will be honest here. I do not always do that. What I look for when I am looking for initiation of a trade is S/R as well. There are times, even on a M1 chart where price can meet the rules of our system but has hit the same support over and over again and has not broke, in this situation I look for support to be broken first then see how I feel about making the trade. Dont forget to look at Bbands. I do have them rather dim on the template, but they do mean something to me. If PA is expanding the outter bands as the rules are being met, I will make the the trade. I hope this helps buddy! Lohad

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Well another day down. Feels good to be back with the world today. Man that cold was a bitch. Really knocked the snot out of me. But now I am back looking for some action. Today was a pretty good day for me. got a chance to get the feel back. I only traded with the trend today. no counter trend trades. My buddy Soeasy69 is converting me I think (He may even have me trade M5 more often). Now I can't say my Countertrend days are done for good, but I see less of them in the future. I did some looking over the last week over the weekend and I noticed even though I had a hit rate over 85%, of the bad trades I hit over 75% were countertrend trades. The others were just bad decisions on my part. The other thing I like to mention, that I feel could be getting left by the wayside here. BBands. There was a time a while back, I decided to to be rid of them. But if you notice on the last template, I had them back on. I have them really dark, because I do not want them to be so prominent that it clutters up the screen, but there is some validity for them in our system here. BBands can show S/R and strength of the move. It will also indicate if a rally or a big drop is about to, or have the chance to come to an end. If you have any questions on BBands, let me know. I can hook you up! So as I said today was a good day. The pip total is nothing to brag about, but it was good to get back in it. And I had no negative trades today. Todays total = 46 pips Weekly Total = 46 pips Peace out guys! Lohad

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Here is the updated stuff. Lohad

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hey, Lohad. was looking at the massive amount of news being released today and was wondering how or if you would play days like today?

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hey i79coop, Good to hear from ya! I am not actively looking to get into the market on EU but keeping an eye on it. Lppks like the news announcement did not do much, but watch for spreads . I am actually paying attention to GU more until about 4:00. I would guess I will get serious after the 5:00 UD and EUR announcements. So much these days, the news is always figured into things already, but you never know. Remember last week?!?!? SO tread lightly. Lohad

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Something is going on in the chat. Not letting me write in it. I am not ignoring you. Lohad

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Sorry I had to bail in the chat earlier guys. I had some "day job" duties I had to deal with. Been trading when I can up 42 so far for the day. How are you guys doing? Lohad

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Another day in the books. I did not get a chance to trade as much as I would have liked to but it was good. Some nice entries on M5 but I found more safe entries on M1. These ranging type of days seem to fit me better on M1. Well I am closing the trading terminal for now...... I may peak at the asian market to see what is going on. But I will be lurking here tonight. If there is any questions I will try to answer them for you. Daily Total = +62 Weekly Total = +108 Have a good one guys! I will try to be in the chat in the am as well (european session). Later! Lohad

--- 帖子 #458 ---
hey lohad, can u post some screens of your entries from today ? would be very interesting to see / learn from

--- 帖子 #459 ---
This one was good for 9 as you can see I STILL need to work on my exits.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Let me put some more up. 1 sec

--- 帖子 #461 ---
This one was for 7. Was a late entry, but I had agreement on M5 so went with it.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
This one was a grinder. I did not get out, because it did not break my mental stop and also BBMacd support was not broken. But it was a grind. I do not like to hold my trades this long. Lohad

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Lohad Are you hand drawing trend lines as on chart above? Or using some indicator to do it? Same regards divergence.... R

--- 帖子 #464 ---
And here is a bad one. -7. I didn't practice what I did on the last one. I really did not have to get out based on BBMacd. Bad Lohad. Bad trader!!!!!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hey Rob I am putting those on myself. Same with Div Lohad

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I m great Lohad, i hv to deal with some 'job' outside this few hours. i'll trade again if it's not busy. kinda hard to scalp and do other thing at the same time. you gotta be infront of ur screen all the time to catch some green pips hehehe

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I'm not good at exiting the trade. If you look at my chart(1m) I enter at the first "right" and exit at the second. I exited because the dot at BBMacd changed to green. Look, after 2 minutes it went down again . I should have look at 5m TF for a longer hold.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
question. do you guys only take short if price is below 50 ma on 1 and 5 minute charts when scalping on the 1 and vice versa? or if price is below on 1 and not on 5 it is still a valid short

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hey Sitaring, Thanks for understanding. I had to take care of my other duties first. With the economy these days, when there is a chance to do work, you need to take advantage of it. Lohad

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Sitaringfx, I looked at your chart. I honestly think you did find. I am still playing with exits based on BBmacd, but that looked to be a 30 pip run. When I am up 10 pips, I hold "mental stop" and make sure I do not lose and at least take some pips. SO I can tell you that I think you did fine.I honestly would have gotten out with the 10 scalp and then when it went down again, I bet I would have re-entered but maybe not. Remember this is a scalping method, especially on a M1 chart. You are right though you might have stayed in for the longer run on M5. But either way, you did a good job. Lohad

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Hey Sirogreness, Welcome to the thread and giving our system a chance. You bring up a very good question. I have been debating this in my head. First, I think the technical answer is yes, wait until both M5 and M1 are in agreement of trend. However, you can, and I have taken trades when the M1 chart is above it's 50sma while on the M5 chart price is not above the 50sma. I consider this a countertrend trade and I am more quick to pull the trigger on profit. If you do trade this way, it is very important that you atleast make sure the price on the M5 chart is above the Non-LagMA and the BBMacd has atleast a blue dot looking like it is going to go long. I hope this helps. It is mainly a feel thing. And I know I could just say to only trade when both agree. But I cannot tell you to do something when I do not always follow that rule. Last week, I lost about 15% percent of my trades. Of the 15% losers, about 75% were countertrend trades. BUT I did win on more countertrend trades then I lost. I hope I did not confuse you. I look forward to working with you! Lohad

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hey Lohad. I am still learning this method. I confuse too to entry on M1, when it's confirm with M5. So I always to late to take a trade. I hope your explanation above can help me. I'll try. Thank you so much...

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Well, I have been following this thread for sometime and I think I can make a contribution with my 2 cents worth. I have modified LOHAD's base template to include 3 things that seem to be on the minds of many. 1. Divergence 2. Stops 3. Trendlines I feel I have addressed the 3 in the following template. However, my template does not contain PSAR, the 10 and 21 MAs. The additions to my template are: 1. Divergence indicator (the best I have found to work on 1 min) embedded into the BB MACD window - Red and Green Arrows show Divergence. 2. Stops Indicator - BBands Stop (with a setting of 10 length) - I find this helps with the "mental stops" as well it helps you from getting out too soon. 3. SHI Channel Indicator - This automatically draws trendlines for you. 4. 100 (yellow) and 200 (pink) SMAs - Many people follow these and they tend to provide good support and resistance levels 5. Fib Pivot Indicator - found this indicator to provide pretty accurate support and resistance levels. You will still need all other indicators provided by LOHAD. Also, my template might seem messy - as always, I think this template can be improved - hope this is of help to others!!!

Dear Lohad, I stumbled upon your tread when making a google search on scalping. I have been trying to get the hang to your system. I have a couple of unanswered questions. I am not sure the role of QQE. It is in the chart but I seem not know how or in what way you want to apply in in your trade. Thanks Arrow

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hey FXDream, Thanks for stopping by the thread. I really appreciate you putting up your chart with your twists. This type of stuff is what I am looking for. I will throw your template up and give it a spin. Thanks alot man! I hope to hear more form ya! Lohad

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Arrow! Thanks for jumping in. More people in our brotherhood! The QQE's role is for confirmation with the the BBMacd. The BBMacd is the what I call the "Kingpin" in this system. It pulls rank of all the other indicators in this system. It is most powerful obviously when going with the trend. And the QQE is used to just give that little extra feeling of comfort. With that being said, you will notice on some of my later posts, I do not have it on my charts. I did find sometimes that the QQE has kept me out of some decent moves. I can appear flat when there is actually a good move. This may be because I am typically on a M1 chart, so it is not a long enough time frame for it to function properly. It may work better on M5 or even if you go to a higher timeframe. Please if you have any more questions, post them. I will answer to the best of my abilities. there is also people in the chat room that are pretty good with this system as well. They can give you some live help. Typically I found the European session is most lively for the chat room. I hope to keep hearing from you. Go get those pips! Lohad

--- 帖子 #481 ---
What is the qqe? line crosses up and down can really catch the start of a trend... thanks for the great strategy. and the tools... may you be rewarded nicely for sharing...

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hey Jiva! Good to hear from you again. The QQE is 2 line indi. It is posted on this thread and shown on some earlier pics and setups. It is a red/blue crossover indication. And it is intended to be used for comfirmation. Thank you for your nice words. You getting plenty of good pips is more then enough reward for me. We are all in the same battle in this Forex universe.

Hey Lohad, What do you think, if I use this great system at Asian and Europe session only, not in US session because very volatile and many big news ? Many thanks for your advice, and for your answers of any questions which always very clear explanation and good language. Sorry my bad english ....

--- 帖子 #487 ---
mmm confused what happened to chatzy

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Piplover, Send me a PM I will walk you through to get in. Lohad

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hey Andita, By all means if you are more comfortable with those sessions, I would trade there. I find the EUR session is the best trade anyways. If you have anymore questions please feel free to post. And I will answer them as soo as possible. Thanks! Lohad

Hey Rob, Many people were saying that it was lagging and they were not able to get in. We just moved over to irc for the moment. Not sure if this will be the final home or Skype. Come on in for the chat. I hope to see you there! Lohad

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Hey FXdream, I have not tried your template yet. But I will. I will let you know. I didn't forget about ya! Lohad

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Thanks Lohad for quick respone. I am still trying this method for EUR/USD only, and I want to use this for live trading like you very soon...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
No problem - I hope the stuff can be of some help.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Sounds good! Just make sure you are comfortable with ANY system you chose to use before you go live. I will help in any way possible. I am glad you are trying our system out. I hope you find it successful. Lohad

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Thank you so much Lohad. You always answer with nice words... I hope you successful too.

Hey guys, Another day trading down. One more to go until the weekend! So hang in there and lets see if we can grab a few more pips to close the week out. We did try another chat room service and does some to work for more people. I hope to see more people there. Te reason we are trying this one is because the old room seemed to lag when we had too many people there. TO get to the new chat room you need to go to: www.ircforex.com Click on the "Chat" tab When you see the screen that says choose nickname: Enter you your name and then click Enter Chat Room. When you get in the chat room. type in the line where you would normally write in: #lohadscalping. THIS IS CASE SENSITIVE AND TYPE EXACTLY LIKE I HAVE IT. NO CAPS AND NO SPACE. (#lohadscalping ) After you type this, hit enter. This will appear in green on the chat screen. Double click on it and it will bring you to the room. I hope to see you guys there. Guys I really have enjoyed posting this system. I have met so many great people and made some pretty good friends here. It has been a blast. I have picked up so many things to add to my toolbox. I really think we getting there. wether your a M5 or M1 trader. We are all on te same page after the same goal KILLING PIPS! I don't care how we get there guys, just as long as we get there. And we will. Daily Total: +63 Weekly Total: +205 Tomorrow, I will be on here in the AM and I will need to leave right around the US open for the day. This weekend I will be typing on my take of the emotional part of trading and how I deal with it. So keep tuned! Have a good one! and remember "Friends don't let friends trade drunk" Peace Out! Lohad

FXdream when you have some time would you mind explaining how you use this indicator i.e what the red disks mean etc? Many thanks ROb

--- 帖子 #498 ---
hello guys, i added another fine indicator to the template : bulls indicator. i use it to find divergence. works fine for me. here u go :

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I believe the red disks are used by the indicator to calculate fractals. See the description of the indication below. If you need more info on SHI Indicators, just google it and you'll find tons of info. Indicator SHI_Channel_true shows Barishpolts' dynamic moving channels in the chart in automated mode. The indicator finds the nearest (in terms of time) fractal in history, searches for the next one, and connects them with a line. Then it draws a parallel line on the maximal fractal on the opposite side. Then it draws a midline between these two lines. Parameters (in brackets - the default value of the parameter): BarsForFract(0) - Length of the fractal "arm". A classical fractal consists of five bars: an extremum and two bars ("arm" is equal to 2) by each side. However, the length of the "arm" can be increased. If the parameter is 0, the length of the "arm" depends on the chart time interval and is determined by the program automatically. The indicator works on all currency pairs and on all timeframes starting with М1.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
LOL god wish I hadnt asked.......I just need something automated if there is such a thing to draw trend lines........ Any ideas? R

--- 帖子 #501 ---
correct way is /join #lohadscalping typed in message area Rob

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hello fxdream, do u have additionial informations about the bbmacd divergence addon ? - when it generates a signal and a green or red arrow pops up, i never see a divergence in the chart. i googled to get information but didnt find something regarding this. thanks, tex

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Check in your indicators folder for the template - You will find the Divergence indicator in there. After you find it, click edit and you will be able to change the settings to display the lines.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I'm sorry I don't understand - This indicator automatically draws the trendlines. The indicator uses the red disks to calculate and draw the lines for you.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I guess what I meant to ask was what does this measure? is it based on moving averages? opening and closing prices? anyone know and can explain a little. thanks

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi Jiva, TO be honest I had to do a little research on this indicator. I knew that this indicator measured strenghth. But I did not know enough about it. This is what I found: QQE: Quantitative Qualitative Estimation. This indicator seems to be comprised of using EMA's RSI and the ATR. SO it looks to be measuring strength of a move based on these three tools. I wish i could give you a more educated answer. Maybe someone here knows enough to substantially answer this for you. Good question Jiva! Thanks, Lohad.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Ahhh then weekend is finally here! I didn't get to trade too much Friday morning (EU/US sessions for me) due to the fact that I had meetings most of the day. But I was still able to rip 24 pips out in the AM. I had a great time in the chat room with Rob24 and Piplover143. These guys are nailing this system! They have their own tweaks which is great! But we are all starting to see entries about the same time! so that tells me we are all on the same page. I had a little too much fun and was playing DJ in the room dedicating tunes to the guys and I accidently kept Piplover out of a move. Sorry Pip!!. I will try not to do that in the future. Rob got the gold star while I was in there. I think he ws up 65 pips before I had to leave. With Piplover making a ferocious comeback. My point is guys, if you want to learn more about this system, there are people in the chat room that are capable of helping out. Their main focus is trading but they have been more then helpful to people having questions. So if I am not around, please feel to pop in and ask questions. It is a fun loose enviroment and trading focused. It has been a lot of fun. Oh and I can't forget my buddy i79coop. We missed him yesterday, but he is nailing this system as well. Coop come back man we miss ya. And I need to give a shout out to my pal Soeasy. This guy is straight to the punch, no holds barred, but he knows his trading. He doesn't exactly trade this system, but his entries are close to where we get in, and he has valuable insight into this profession. Easy, I will respond to your e-mails. So results: Daily Total: 24 pips Weekly Total: 229 pips. I can live with it. Thanks guys for a fun week. I like the team we are building here. Peace Out! Lohad

--- 帖子 #508 ---
not a problem man. due to choppy market i am not able to trade like everyday. I find one very good move but due to previous losses i put take profit at 8. price hits that target. &amp; after that price becomes choppy again. so i quit trading. still add 2% in my account which is better than nothing. &amp; Please help tex to better understand divergence in bbmacd. i dont have complete knowledge about it so its dangerous to give incomplete knowledge to fellow trader.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Guys, Please forgive me, but I am about to off on a diatribe of somethings I feel are important. Choose not to read if you like. I won't be offended. But this morning I would like to talk about emotions. Keep in mind I am not a pro. I have only been trading for about a 1-1/2. But what there has been two things that I had to hurdle real quick to keep afloat in this profession: Money Management and Emotions ( my speach on money management will come in the future). But these two things are what I consider the most important things to tackle in order to be a good trader. I don't care what kind of system you have. Every system I believe is good for someone. Every system I believe can make you tons of money. But the saying is so true: "It is 70% the trader and 30% the system". Notice the "vague" part of that equation? The system. You can put any system name in that part of the equation Lohad, V Force, FX Prime anyone of those systems can be plopped into that saying. But the constant in that saying is the TRADER. You can only put your name there. It is always going to be and never will change. The success ratio is going to be based on 70% of Lohad and 30% of the Lohad system or Vforce system or FX Prime system or etc.... So what you need to get in check is no more then yourself. If you are not right, no system in the world is going to save you. There are planty of good systems out there. I like to feel we have a good one here. But there are tons of good systems out there. This system just happens to fit with my emotions and state of comfort. Let's face it M1 traders are considered a strange crew. Most of people around here say that in order to be successful you need to be playing 4HR charts. And to be quite honest they have valid points. But for me (the 70% in my equation) it does not work. I think M5 some times takes too long for me. And there tons of people that say trading M5 charts is suicide. So if you are using this system or any other system for that matter, you are trying to master, what many consider is the toughest trading style in this already tough industry. And if you are going to do this. You need to have your emotions in check. You can get rattled pretty easily doing this. When I began trading. I was KILLING demo. I was going to be rich by last Christmas. My future was set. So. I took the plunge. I put my money in and payed the ante. My Money management was completely incorrect, and I was not emotionaly prepared. My first trade.... a big loser. Wow what a whirlwind of an experiance! My hands got sweaty, i started breathing heavy, I thought I was going to go into a panic attack. I remember that trade like it was yesterday. It took me alot to get over that. My confidence was shattered. I would then sit there in front of the computer watching a move go by with my finger twitching to push the button and I was paralyzed. Too afraid to get in the game again. Too afraid to lose. The most important thing to get over in this market is to learn to handle a loss. And also learn to handle not taking a trade. Sometimes the best trade you will make in your trading career is the trade that you did not take. And this system here we are building. I think it is a damn good system. But is NOT loss proof! You will lose from time to time in this system. The only way to acheive the "Holy Grail" in trading is to find it in yourself. Once you tackle the emotions of trading, you have tackled 70% of your biggest problem. Emotions, dedication, patience and MM is the most powerful tools any trader can learn. DO NOT revenge trade. Cut the losses short, accept that there was a bad read made or that the system gave a false read and try to get the next one. If you go into a drawdown period, walk away. Live to trade another day! Well that is enough of my rant. Go get em and BAG THEM PIPS. Lohad

Let me see what I can find. I will post on DIV. Thanks Pip!

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Sorry wasnt being rude....indicator seems to draw lines based on fractals? I was looking for trend lines .

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Finding DIV on a M1 chart I feel is difficult. And I am still looking to see how reliable it is on M1. But this is a picture of what I see as Bearish DIV. Price is making new highs in an uptrend but the peaks on the BBMacd is going lower. I will try to post some more and better examples. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Lohad check your email R

--- 帖子 #514 ---
hey lohad, thanks for the screenshot, that makes things much clearer. cya in the chatroom cheers, tex

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Tex! That sounds great. I will try to find more examples! Have a great weekend. Lohad

--- 帖子 #516 ---
To talk about emotions, I would suggest everyone to read Trading in the Zone.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Yes that is a good read. I am currently reading the book and I am quite impressed. Thus reason I felt like talking about emotions.

Well folks. I have to do something for the first timce since I opened this thread. I have to report a day in the negative. Well I was due. It was a struggle, to say the least, for me. It was a pretty messed up day. I had to miss most of the EU session early on and just when I got back to trade, the "Chop" came in. Then I tried to force trades. It was a back and forth day for me. I was up, I was down I laughed, I cried . I couldn't get in a groove today. If you have noticed in the chat room, I am working on a possible V2.0 for this system. I have a couple of people kind enough to work with me on this. We are in the process of beta testing. We started this today. To be honest with my loss today, we are not getting off on the right foot. I am not sure if it was the market conditions, myself or the new system. I will obviously need to have more testing time to make a conclusion. Even if I bounce back tomororw and have a good day, I will still need more testing to make sure that this system is an improvement. There have been people in the chat room asking for me to send the system, and at this time, I am not going to post it. I want to make sure I am releasing a viable version of this system. I will keep you updated. Todays Results: -10 pips Weekly Total: -10 pips. We will hit it again tomorrow. I will be trolling around here if you have any questions tonight. P.S. Dracozny was kind enough to set up a permanent chat room for us. Please use the link in the previous post to access it. I hope to see you guys there. Have a good one! Lohad

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Man had a busy day working with some great people on the newest version. I am currently working on 3-4 differnt tweaks. But I really do feel we are making progress on it. I know a couple of people have been pushing for the new version and I will post it out here as soon as I am sure we have the right one. Who knows it may just stick to the version on page 31. I do have a stripped down version that I have been trading with from time to time today that I could post out here if people are interested. It is a pretty stripped down version of the current system. If there is any interest in that. Please let me know on the thread here. Ok, had a good day today. Took care of my bad day yesterday. We will keep pluggin away. Daily Total: +60 (Yes Piplover I had to to get the last one to round out to 60) Weekly Total: +50 Have a good one! Oh come join in on the fun in the chat room. It is some good trading fun! Later, Lohad

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hey Lohad, Can you post here the newest version of this system right now, please ? Thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I miss a lots of action here ya?! Chatzy is not active anymore?!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
yup, simply the better

--- 帖子 #524 ---
hey lohad, piplover here sent you email check it out

Same

hey lohad, sent u an e-mail too. check it out tex

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hi Lohad, I'd be interested in seeing what you are using a a stripped down version. Do you have it in templete form? Thanks much. Cliff

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Yes I will be posting on here.... hopefully today yet at least my "Stripped" version of this system. I am currently working on a mass overview of 3.... possibly 4 different ways to view this system. Each different "Format" will be based on the same principles as to which I started posting about. The purpose of the multiple views of this method is to give you, the trader different views of the same system in hopes that you will find something that you are comfortable with while trading this system. Aso these different "formats" will be based on the level of how agressive you want to trade the M1 and M5 charts. With having these different formats set, we still should all be able to discuss the core of this method while in chat (chat... I will dive into this more later). So bear with me. I am currently compiling all of this information so we can have it in one neat package. This is a fair amount of work and will take me some time. Once this is released, you should be able to take a look at it, and apply whatever "tweaks" you feel are needed. If there is any tweaks that you care to share. I can tell you I will try them all out. I may not choose to incorporate into the system as it evolves. However this does not mean that your tweaks are not good, but just didn't fit my comfort level. I appreciate all of the help I have received from you guys (you know who you are), and I look forward to releasing this new information and seeing what you think. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Some of you may have heard, I am no longer attending the chat room that Dracozny kindly setup for us. This chat room was already created by another trader and the link was created to go directly to that chat room. However, even though the chat room started out great, it was quickly derailed and the focus was getting shifted to other trading systems. First of all, I am here to help and share and also gain knowledge. I created a system that I could use with a high level of success and I wanted to share it to other traders and also to gain more knowledge on how we can upgrade this system. I am not on an ego trip. I have nothing against other systems. Heck, I have reached out to other creators of some popular systems to see if I could use come nuances of their systems in order to work on what I am trying to achieve. Thankfully there are a lot of nice people here on FF and they had no issues with my trying to evolve my system with some of their tools. BUT, myself and some fellow traders have put a significant amount of time in trying to achieve this. Through the flow of conversation in chat room, it became apparent that we were working on a new system. I was pestered by a trader over and over again to turn over the new system to him, even when I said that I was not comfortable enough to do that until I felt we had cleaned up versions of what I was trying to achieve. After repeated requests from this trader, I went ahead and released this to him before completion. After all he was the owner of the chat room. Once this transaction was done, I felt the thread immediately was derailed and the focus was on a completely different system. I might add the different system that was discussed is a very good system, just not for me. The reason for this rant, is to illustrate why I am going to create a new chat room at the same site (ircforex.com, hopefully). I have put in a request to an admin over there to see what I need to do. The purpose of this room is going to be for discussion of this method, trading this method and sharing "tweaks" of this method. I am sure you can understand this. As I am sure if you were to go to the VForce chat room and starting talking about this method, the response would not be positive for you. I will keep you posted of what is happening here, and I will clean up this thread to make it more user friendly such as updating post #1 and updating information on my signature for ease of use. Thank you to all of you traders who have put up with the evolution of this method and multiple turns. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #530 ---
So this was your first negative day was it? Your results seem totaly fabricated. How about some proof? I bet you wont be posting any results and showing us the results of trades from your account will you? If you had nothing to hide and were honest this would not be a problem - just blank out the account number? Come on - show us you have nothing to hide and were telling the trueth about your results. I bet you can't can you? The more i read your thread the more you remind me of this guy http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=86533 Same rubbish.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
WTF ?! u want a proof come to his chat room !! I was with lohad in his chatroom for several days now. And he was always saying when he got in the market and out of it. His system is working, i am using it too. And hes still improving it So my friend, don't be that rude. Lohad isn't cheating and he has nothing to hide !!

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Ok guys chat room is back on! Same place as normal. I have gotten things straightened out with the admins on ircforex. Thanks a ton Dracozny! So same bat time, same bat channel. I will see you there. Maybe an hour later though. Little late. Lohad

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Dean you have to be kidding me. Well judging from your past posts. I hope this thread does not take the same fate the other threads you have been involved in. I hope we don't end up in the recycling bin. You are one negative person man. You need to lighten up. I have nothing to prove to you. I don't care if you use this system or not. I mean I hope that you would give it a try, but to each there own. Before I take your post seriously. Let me ask you a question. Have you even tried to trade this system? I tell you what pal, stop by the chat and you will see guys in there out performing me. People are doing well with it. If it is not for you, then cool. I am not a scam, I am not asking for money, and you can ask several people that my integrity is solid. In the chat, I am more then willing to tell the room when I am in, how much I made or how much I lost. Take a chill pill and relax man. Next time don't let your losses spread negativity to others. hehehe unreal......

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Tex, Thanks buddy. Wow I did not see that one coming. Oh well to each their own. C ya tomorrow in the chat! Lohad

--- 帖子 #535 ---
WTF??? indeed!!! Tex, You are way too kind to Deang001, that Dingo's arse. Your right about Lohad not wanting anything more than to share a method that is working for him with others. Lohad is a top rate teacher. He has pointed out when things have not gone his way a number of times. More importantly, he has also reinforced the notion to stick to it and not give up. You put to type a lot nicer reply than I would have. What I might have said is; "Deang001, you miserable Swagman. You should change your sign on name to, The Whinge from Woopwoop. If you weren't such blabbering Sook, you'd give it a burl. But my guess is you, and people like you, will always be nothing more than a Yobbo No-hopper. Of course, that'd be if I was to reply. I'm too nice a person to lower myself to his level. I'm all about sharing the love. A hard days work. A pint or two or three at the local with friends n' fams'. Yep, yep...Tex...it's a good thing you said everything that needed to be said so that I wouldn't have to chime in. !Ciao! for now. Cliff WTF ?! u want a proof come to his chat room !! I was with lohad in his chatroom for several days now. And he was always saying when he got in the market and out of it. His system is working, i am using it too. And hes still improving it So my friend, don't be that rude. Lohad isn't cheating and he has nothing to hide !![/quote]

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Dean Why not just try the system? It is FREE so why should Lohad spend his time "proving" it works to you? Others are getting good results, its not perfect but it IS profitable attempting to make use of parts of other systems too and frankly nobody could care less whether you believe it or not. Try it or forget it. Demanding proof is a waste of time.....remember this is a place for sharing and testing. R

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Lohad, I asked you this already in the beginning of your thread but I don't see it happen at all, why don't/can't you post the charts with the actual entry/exit points? That would help people A LOT.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
What? rubbish? Try the system first!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Artov, Artov, Artov, I have listened to your request when first asked. Apparently you do not visit or follow the thread that much. That is ok. However, if you were to read and keep up with the thread, you would have noticed the following posts of actual entries that have been taken: #358 #363 #365 This was even a losing trade #366 #374 Ths trade was not mine but an actual trade by someone who is using the system #385 #387 So I suggest you go back and take a look at them. I have also described good entries in the documents that have been done. Also if you were to go into the chat, you will see me and other users talking about entries exits and modifications. I have not posted entries lately, because I am in the middle of tweaking the system along with other users. Does this response suffice for the moment. Are you using the system at all? If interested and you are not using the system, let me know if you are having problems, I can set you up. Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Thanks for the nice words Rob.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
I hear ya Sitaring. I have no problem thinking the system is junk, but atleast try it out first. Do it on demo, it wouln't cost you anything but time. Thanks! Lohad

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Lohad, I can't fricking believe you have the nerve to get on here, share your system for free and not prove to us your trades and account statements. Jeez, how could you. some people, eh. I will share some of my thoughts on tweaks later as well just for perusal sake. Later.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Here I have some indi's which should work fine with fine tuning the system. The indi's speak for themselves, no rocket science. And of course use ADX.

So here are some charts. infant stages. Basically for long I want to see BBmacd come from below and cross bottom line with at least 2 dots in new direction. Price must close in or above white channel I added. Targets and stops seem to work good with Lohad's settings. but up to you. Or stop can be a close outside the channel in oppo direction for bigger moves. The MA's are just filter and are used at discretion. Not so much a cross I care about as the Slope. You can see below some 5m entries, but better yet i think will be using 1m in conjunction for trend reentries and Countrend plays. let me see if I can upload . Eventually hope to get sleep patterns worked out to see you guys in room at euro open, but............... Also , beware time of day odviuosly when there is movement.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
oh, and I slowed down the bbmacd to 19,39

Lohad, ignore the criticism and keep doing what your doing. I'm learning a lot and making pips in the process. Now if I can only get up at 3am for the Eur open and join you guys in the chat. I'm in Fl that's way to early for me.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
shouldn't need any special indicators except the bbmacd. now i shall make virgin attempt at posting a template. let me know if it works; well, i can't find it under templates at the moment. let me feed the kids 1st. where would it be other than mt4-templates? or indicators-templates.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
look at this! just playing, not trading. slower time frame good. billy's capital to trade it bad.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Ok guys, The following is the current version that I am working with. I am still developing 2 more templates, but this is the one I a trading with when I have time to make a trade lately. This is what I call Lohad Stripped. I know probably still too many indicators for some, but this is a starting point. Same entry rules as normal. The Stop is a little more defined. I use the HA (Heiken Ashi) Smoothed. If I was long, I would exit when price cuts the other side of HA Smoothed. Or you can exit at the cross of MaxNonLag MA. The BBmacd has been modified to create a quicker entry. I still would advise against a countertrend (but I will still do it once in awhile). If you are going to to take a countertrend trade, make sure there is some good distance between price and the 50SMA. Price will always want to come home (come back to 50SMA). Also as an alert or confirmation is the Brain Trens Sig4. You can choose to use it or not. Just played with it starting today and I do like it so far. Attached is a screenshot, template, and indicators. Please let me know if you have any questions. I will be in the chat room around the time of London open. Or post here. Thanks guys. I will release the other templates when they are done. Also, Thanks so much to the guys that have helped developed this system. We are making progress. And I think you will like all of the options for this system when they get posted. I willl say I am looking at a 2MA alert that may be changed out with the Brain Trend 4. I will test it and post it for another tool for you, if it works good. Thanks! Lohad

Stifland, Nice Setup! It will be interesting to see someone use this on M5, I do not think there is many in the chat using M5, but I think it will work, I will trade on M5 form time to time as well. Hope to see you in the chat again! Thanks for trying this out. Lohad

Hey Skin! Thanks for the nice words. We will just keep trucking on buddy! I am glad you are baggin some pips! I am in the chat primarily from London open until about 2:00 PM EST. I am in and out sometimes. But feel free to drop in. We are getting more traders in there. I think you have a good time. Peace! Lohad! [quote=Skin;2648416]

Well, been a hectic couple of days, but I feel we are making some good progress. I will keep this short. Gotta hit the sack to be fresh for London! Wed Daily Total +9 Pips (uughh) Thurs Daily Total +21 pips Weekly Total: +80 pips. Weekly Goal is in trouble! Oh well. We will do the best we can! Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Thanks Stifland for putting up your chart. I suppose your entry variant is slightly different compared to Lohad's original method. You suggest entry after the 2nd colour changed in BBMACD but Lohad had suggested that the entry will start after the trend had crossed beyond the other BB boundary. In the latter method, I notice that we might enter a trade too late after a trend has begun but in the former (stifland's) we may get caught in a false change of trend. There is a high possibility that the BBMACD may revert back to the original trend after 2 bars. Has anyone analyse the profil difference between this 2 entry method. Thanks

Yeah, maybe early sometimes, but that's trading...also, remember it is not always so mechanical, I watch the 5m and the Slope of the the yellow and blue kines and the channels relationship to then. 1st line. Nice short. probably around 30 pip winner and done for the day if you have daily goal. 2nd. 2nd. would be loser if pure mechanical, but look at lines and 5m. seem like good long? 3rd.Looks better, yellow starting to turn, but probably wait until 4th line . Channel and price start to break through and 5 is now blue. Like I said, all these are a work in progress.

OK, somebody help. I am trying to upload tpl for your viewing , criticism, praise, chat,etc. The ones I download off FF like Lohad's I can find in appropriate directory. The ones I save on the platform seem/must be somewhere else because I can't find them to upload. Have a good beery weekend..

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hey Stifland? Are you using a MT4 broker? Lohad

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I answered my own question. Looks like you are on FXDD. The path to your templates is: c:/programfiles/BROKER/templates there is another template directory which is a sub-directory somewhere else, and this is not where you look for templates. Does that make sense? Thanks! Lohad

Hey Lohad, Great week, huh? I just down loaded your tweeks. Nice work. BrainTrend4Sig looks interesting. I checked out their website. Got a question on the BrainTrend4Sig. Does it repaint? If it does, how are you dealing with it? Thanks much for your continued support. Cliff

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hey CCE, The week was not bad, but I did not reach my wekly goal of 150. I did not get enough trading in last week. I will update the status here later but I eneded up with like 121 or something. The Brain Trend DOES repaint. I should have tested it more before putting on here. Sorry about that. How I have dealt with it, was taking it off the template. I do not use it. I will update the thread with details shortly. Hopefully you had a good week of trading. Lohad

I like this how do we trade it? lol soeasy69

--- 帖子 #572 ---
ya, that string is where i find templates i downloaded, but when i save ones i build they aren't in there. hic. so maybe i will just type in settings for channel when iget back. i think it is only thing i like over yours and could help for runners.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
am testing MACD with settings (21,100,9) and sar for identifying trades as I think macd with altered settings also clearly identifies entries combined with the sar for trailing a stop this is very nice. avoiding consolidations.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Cool Stifland, I can't wait to see what you have! Lohad

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Let me run through the simulator and I will check it out. I will report my findings! Thanks Jiva! Lohad

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I don't understand why you are entering short with macd and long with sar. Shouldn't you have same entry rules for both directions?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Alright looking forward to see what the new week bring us. Made some good developments last week on the template and excited to see what we can do for results. Last Friday was a little choppy but was pleased with the results. Did not quite make my weekly goal, but was pleased with the results due to the amount of time missed in trading due to trying to develop the template. Fridays Results +46 Pips Weekly Results +126 Pips I hope everyone has a great week of trading! Lohad

indicator that shows last 3 1Hr candle in your current TF chart cheers

--- 帖子 #579 ---
either, or. I am a little flexible. Both don't necessarily have to be perfectly aligned. If the Macd100 is trending in the same direction it serves to confirm the strength of the sar signal... Am just testing this. But I notice the qqe gives a lot of false signals for the lines crossing. If the Macd100 doesn't give the same signal it seems to work out that the qqe wasn't a strong signal.

Jiva, I checked this out on backtest a little and you are correct. Thanks for bringing this up! Lohad

Guys / Gals, I am you guessed it, posting another template, version or method for trading this system. I can assure you that I am done posting new versions for quite some time. I feel that we have achieved V2. When V3 comes, time will tell. I apologize for all of the changes. I have been trying to get too cute, and tweaking the hell out of system that really just need to be simplified. The focus will now be on how to trade this system. Not on how to change a system that not everyone knows how to trade. This is the system that I will be trading with. So if you are in the chat room, you will know that I will be using this template. I am hoping that this will get people on the same page. And hopefully we can achieve consistency in trading this system. I really do appreciate all of the changes that you have rolled along with me on. I really do appreciate the "Crew" who helped me get this system to where I felt it needed to go. I have really learned a lot from you and it has been a lot of fun. So please take a read and try it out if you would like to. Please feel free to ask me any questions. Or have at it if you need to vent some frustration towards me with all of the changes. I know I have it coming. I am uploading only the new indicators for this. If you do not have the other indicators, they are located on the first page of this thread. I would zip them up, but for some reason, people have a hard time working with my zipped files. Thanks again! Lohad

--- 帖子 #583 ---
thanks, many.... am running this version through the demo and it's very smooth and clear... Maybe Land of Hopes and Dreams is real......

I'm useless for helping with the development of this trading system. But I know when something is hot.... I stumbling onto the site and the thread... Lucky me.. I love what's going on here. The stacking of HAS,the cutter and price is super. The trade just pops out saying "here I am...." geniuses at work here. I was thinking how this is sort of like hacking into forex.... the big guns are slinging millions around and some little people use their intelligence to hack into the system... Not to bring it down, but to catch a little of the action.... brilliant... Dumb bunny here... having a great time with this.. Thanks much...

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Jiva, Thanks so much for your kind words! Words like that just recharges a guy. I am so glad that this system is working for you. I am also lucky by working with some very intelligent trouble shooters and traders to help take this system to where it is. As long as everyone remembers, that you still need to pay attention price action to make this system successful. Support and resistance areas, and trading with the trend are also keys to the success of this system. Thanks again Jiva. Lohad

I am sending this in early. Going out to celebrate my Dad's birthday. Well I broke even today. That is right zero pips. But to tell you the truth, I am quite proud of it! I battled back from down 9 to get back to even. Only made a few trades. I walked away, because I was not feeling it. You can have a good system, but remember it is only 30% of the equation. If you are not feeling it, or seeing price right, no system is going to help. Knowing when to walk away can sometimes be your most valuable tool. Some days protecting your account is more important then gaining a lot of pips. So I will live to trade another day, with the SAME account value and not a smaller one. We will try to hit it tomorrow. With the EUR session closed tomorrow, I will be late to the chat room. I will check out the NY session though. But it maybe a good couple of days (tomorrow and Monday) to do some house cleaning (cleaning and refining the system) and yes I have house cleaning duties to clean up this thread. I will see ya tomorrow. Lohad Daily Total: 0 pips Weekly Total 104 pips

Easter holiday, Friday people taking 3 day vacation, traveling etc. trading will be muted most likely for US forex. Probably London slow too. Thanks for sharing your experiences, Mr. Lohad. To be honest with you I'm not making any profit. Just using demo and a micro account ($25) to dip toes in. This is not as easy as some would have others believe. The micro account is good for me because of the tiny investment required to actually trade but because the leverage is so high 400:1, miniscule moves can add up to exagerated losses. Of course those same moves can be good gains. I had one good run a while ago with EURCHF. The EUR went down for 3 straight days and I traded in and out the whole time. It was a real picnic. I turned $25 into $250 in 3 days. So I know it is possible. I just caught the trend and rode it all the way. No fancy indicators. Just fibs and fractals. But I haven't been able to identify another situation like that. Much of my difficulty stems from my own impatience. Too impatient and get in too early (trade goes against me), or too impatient and get out and miss the best part of a run. Typical novice trader stuff. Or I stay too long in a trade and lose the gain. I don't clearly understand the retracing and reversal differentiation. So I enter when it is reversing and get out when it is merely retracing. I am certain that any system is only as good as the person using it and their basic knowledge of what is actually going on with the buying and selling. For instance is the action taking the pair down on partial position closing for profit taking from a big run up and it will resume climbing again or is it shorts moving in and longs closing-out positions and the run is over? I'm sure that the more I can decipher the trading sentiment the more valuable the readings with the indicators and the more powerful a tool any system will be. This system is visually and aesthetically easy to use. It's not a brain drain or an eyesore. Pretty clear. I plan to keep practicing with it. Oh, another thing,since this post is like "true confession," I have to be very careful of is clicking the wrong action on my trading menu. Today I wanted to set a sell limit for a position I had in EURUSD (live trading not the demo) and I inadvertedly closed it for a loss. Just clicked the wrong button. This happens more than I care to admit, and once is too many times!!!! I get excited. And my clarity is gone. I love the lessons I am learning. Trading is opening up a whole new dimension of awareness. About myself, how the world works, discipline, self control, fear, anger, greed, honesty, etc. etc. etc. Have heard it said that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to master something. For me at my rate of involvement that will be about 5 years. I look forward to it. Kind of a long ramble. Hope it didn't put ya to sleep. jiva(a living entity)....

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Hi Jiva, If you ask me, bring honest with yourself and identifying the things that you need to work on to improve yourself is profit. As I keep going back to it, You are 70% of the equation. I am glad you are enjoying the system and I look forward to have you grow as we do in this industry. Thanks, Lohad

I did not take a trade Friday. I spent the time during these dead markets to work on exit strategies with a few com padres of mine. I do not plan on trading Monday as well, but I will be looking.

As I always do on the weekends, I review the losses I had for the previous week. I thought I would share the results. I may try to post these every weekend, depending on how much time this will take to type. So this last week, I had 10 loser trades out of 71 trades over all (85.9% winners). By the way this is from 04-03-09 so a little more then a week I guess for this data. These bad trades went as follows: Countertrend trades = 3 bad trades Good Trades / Bad Mgmt = 3 bad trades (all trades profitable - did not manage trade well) Not all Signals Met Trades = 2 bad trades Bonehead Trades = 1 bad trade (Renegade trade no rules were met at all) Shakeout Trade = 1 bad trade (rules met / shook out / traded in tight range) So: 30% of my bad trades were countertrend trades 40% of my bad trades were mismanaged 30% of my bad trades - I have no excuse I will keep track of these in this format. Maybe this will me see where I need to improve. This week show CT's are bad, and I need to work on my management. Thanks, Lohad

Hey Stifland, I am going to pass on trading tonight however I will be looking at the market. Also, tomorrow, I will not be looking to trade London session, but maybe NY session if cooperates. I will be in the chat room Monday morning (London) session, but I will not be in as early as normal. Thanks, Lohad

Hi Lohad, Monday is a bank Holiday in UK, so be careful, volume will be very thin. regards Pardy

Hi Lohad, I've recently stumbled on your thread and it looks like the kinda thing which could be my cup of tea, so to speak. Anyhow, I have loaded the LOHAD Crew scalping system and have printed out the instructions so that I can follow them while I have my screen up and running. I get most of it apart from the BBMacd (aka Kingpin) which I am struggling with. Could you tell me how to 'read' this particular indicator and what I need to be looking for? Also, when the madro gives you the buy/sell arrow, do you wait until you see the first green light in the Sidewinder? Thanks for posting your system and I look forward to making a few pips with it (fingers crossed!) Cheers, Benn

--- 帖子 #609 ---
hi and welcome mr benn. actually i am too new to this system.but since yesterday,my win percentage is 60%.my losses are due to lack of discipline.like what lohad said before, a good system is only 30% of being a good trader. now i am +26 pips and will do my best to improve.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi Mr. Benn, Thanks for stopping by and checking this system out. The BBMacd, you are looking to pay attention to the dots. In an up move, you want the dot to be above the top line of the BBMacd with a little separation preferred. I changed the settings as well of the BBMacd, should come up automatically with the new template, but it is (from top to bottom) 10,24,7,0.5. Yes you need to wait for the sidewinder to be green, you can also use the FXPrime V2 - Final JE indicator, which I am using. Works the same as sidewinder, I just prefer this one. I will attach to this post. Let me know if this answered you question, if not, please let me know. Also, in the first post, there is a PDF file of the BBMacd that is very important that you read. This will explain how to use the BBmacd and show how powerfull this indicator can be. Thanks Lohad

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Hey mimet, Thanks and well done. Sounds very promising! Lohad, Many thanks for the info, thats very helpful. I presume you remove the Sidewinder indi and replace with the FXPrime V2 then..? I'll give that one a go. Cheers guys and good luck. Benn

--- 帖子 #612 ---
That is correct!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi Lohad, Does my chart look about right to you sir? Same rules with the FXPrime, ie. Green = good to go, Red = no go? I see there is no Amber anymore so its either a yes or no system with no middle ground? Thanks a lot for your help Lohad. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Mr. Benn, Yes your chart is right. However on the FXPrime filter, Green = Long, Red = Short. So you wanna see the arrow for possible trade and trade direction, Confirm with FXPrime filter and BBMacd. You are ready to go! Lohad

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Ah, got it! Many thanks. Here's to grabbing some pips hopefully. Benn

Any coders here using this? or maybe this already exists? An indicator similar to sidewinder/fxprime that displays Blue if bbmacd dots Blue and above upper line Red if bbmacd dots Red and below lower line yellow if red/blue between lines...... rgds R

Hey everyone, Piplover has an exit rule that I feel is pretty good. What he does is put a 5SMA on the chart applied HLC/3. What he does is once he is in a trade, he closes when prices crosses and or closes on the opposite side of the 5SMA. Check it our if you like. It seems to be working for him when he follows it. Thanks, Lohad

Hey guys, I had a pretty disappointing day. I was all jacked up for this day and I just flat out blew it. My focus was not there. I cut my winning trades way too short. I can't tell you how many trades I had at BE or +1. Just not there for me today. I am disappointed in myself, but we will get them tomorrow. Since my bread and butter time is the London session and into the New York session, I will give myself a new guideline. During these times, I will be more focused on trading. I will hold off on working on different tools for exits and such until at least 10:00 AM CST. I will still be in the chat, but I will be more focused when need be. No one take this the wrong way. I am basically talking to myself and correcting the derailment that I had allowed happen. Daily Total: 15 Pips Weekly Total: 15 pips Have a good one traders and we will see you in London.

Well another under-achieving day. I ended up in the positive, but still left way too many pips on the table. You will be seeing my focus increasing on my exits. I made a 11 trades on Wednesday and I went 10-1, yet the pip count was minimal. And my loss was only -4. This tells me again that my entries are spot on, but my trade management is something that is lacking. Well we will keep on keeping on.

finally did it. am taking a course from FXCM . Power Course. So many cheaters out there I have avoided signing on to anything that asks for tuition. But this is really helping me focus. And very inexpensive. I think $29. Actually they are offering it free for account holders. Already have working knowledge of indicators, basic trading techniques, money management etc. But somehow this course is helping me to focus and synergize. Good luck to all. Granny (jiva34)

Hi Lohad, congrats on your system it looks very pretty I wanna try it. I just started reading rules, but I don't see where you use Bollinger Bands that you have on price chart itself? do you use them at all? And lso could you tell which pairs do you trade personally and which hours? thanks! Sergey

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi All, I think Lohad has his hands full trying to setup new server. Never a fun deal. Here is a thought on how to use the BB's for quick CT trade. 50sma has not been breached so it needs to be viewed as a quick in and out. If trade goes against you 5-7 pips or so then kill the trade for sure. PA fades away from upper BB and breaks the MaxNonLag. Trade was taken when the price broke below bottom last local high candle. Below top purple arrow. Trade concluded with +8 pips after spread and bounce at MaxNonLag. The 5TF and 15TF are both in up trend. So, don't ask for more than the PA can give. Notice market bounces up after I closed trade. I actually hit TP at +6 pips but FXDD did not close the trade when I hit the mouse button. I normally try for 1-3 pips with this type of trade. Hope this helps anyone having questions on implementing this great method. Cliff

Well as it seems this thread is dying off, I am not sure I am posting this to myself, but here goes. After some important conversations, with my trading partner, it has become apparent that I need to scale back on the duties required on this thread and the chat room. The need to re-focus on trading has become apparent. Because of the friends I have met through doing this and the fun of troubleshooting systems and just the trading conversations in general I am not going to completely walk away from this thread and chat. What is going to change is that I will mostly be non-existent in the chat room while I am "on the clock". I will still post my results and templates that I am working on and I will help answer questions on this thread while I am, again "off the clock". This has been fun for me and trading talk is always one of my favorite things to do, but my trading partner and I depend on this to make a living and it is obvious that I need to focus on this. So those of you still following this, you can still expect to see my daily results and developments on this system. If you have any questions, you can always post here, see me in the chat (mainly around noon or 2:00PM CST) or you can always e-mail me. I hope you have found this system profitable or that you were able to take pieces of this system to enhance your own. I hope I was able to help atleast a few in this dirty little battle that Forex can be. Regards, Lohad

Hi: I have been reading your thread. I try t daily read a thread, I don't work. Have too much time. Mostly, for years, have spun around with this. I have learned a lot though. My family trades, and one member made 57,000 pips in pennies over the last several month. She is a teacher and only has a few hours in the evening to monitor her charts and put her trades in. There is something here in what she does, no contest there. She has an International Business Degree, so has an awareness of the world money at large. I have been the brains and trade..... Here goes: We have used the AC and AO, and that the macd can maybe replace these. Sometimes too much clutter. Use a ZZ to see the progression of the waves. No contest, if the wave is up,or long,or whatever you want to call it, you will have up to 3 waves up and two pullback. If the wave is down you will have two waves down and one pullback. If you cannot get this you will always loose your money after you make it. You will make it in the uptrend and losse it in the downtrend or vise vera, Depends where you get in, up or down . It is the march of the market, the channels are link between these to moves,beginnning or advancing. We use PSAR at .05 and .4, Slope v2 with Damoni Non Lag and Gann ZZ on price. I use Pivot Lines. These are on price. AO, AC, for indicators. When the AO changes over the O line, the wave on whatever advance in the market march is changing. If yo have been in an uptrend the AO changing below the o, then know you are in a pullback. AC should be used to who you when the price is going with the major trend of the move in the direction of what the AO is positioned. Getting in is not a problem. Take the trend from the Daily WAVE Ok, here is really the money: The money is made on the advancement of the wave, and as the march goes up or down the pivots. The daily candle shows you if it closes over the pivot line and the indicators are up you can probably go to the 4h or 1h charts at get it in that direction with a trade of the five, just make it match. To make moneuy in the market, you must Capture it. Tis market moves around a lot but it goes just exactly where is is programmed to go. You have to put orders in that go with the trend before it goes. If you wait until after all the indicators for entry and exit line up, then it is too late and it is turning around. The flip over the on AO tells you the big moves are coming with the PSAR oon the daily. We put 5 separate orders, go in with five at the same price. Look at the ATR, if it is 35, Go with exits of 5 for the first order and ten for the second etc. Make sure you have an EA the puts or you put a BE on all of the orders at the same time to start on the first order filled. THe Brokers want you to concentrate on the entrance when you should rally look at the exit.s , if the entry is the answer. It is the answer for the broker. The answer is in the exit for us. We have got all the parts of this. Now only we could get a simple entry bast on maybe PSAR and MACD at 5-34-5. and get the exit programmed so we could code it for the atr of the chart. So you could change the profits for each order easily. Just rambling. Good Luck

Hi SusanD, Thanks for the ideas, I will re-read your post and check these out. I am thinking about putting out here on the thread what I have been working on that is Lohad related. I am quite pleased with it the early results. But not enough forward testing to be sure that the early results are not a fluke but an actual sample of expected results. If I feel that what I am working on is an improvement I will post. Just not sure if this system has died in the realm of FF. I will check out your tips! Thanks SusanD Lohad

Hey guys, I have made some significant adaptations to the LOHAD system. I know I have been absent from the thread and the chat room lately and the system has seemed to die off. Some of this has been by design. Maintaining the thread and chat room responsibilities had become a deterrent to my trading. Also, I had some contracts that I am currently working on for my other business that has taken time away from my trading. Also, I felt that there was a need for some adaptation to the system as a result from all of the feedback I have received from everyone else. So in the last month, I have come up with a modified system that is LOHAD based. I feel the the results are very good. I have tried many things in this time and I feel I am 90% percent of the way there to cleaning this up, for I do not feel this is a clean enough version for release. What I currently have is a system that has 3 indicator windows and I am looking to get down to 2 indicators. What I am looking for is help from people that have traded the LOHAD system before. I think there is some knowledge needed of the previous system to help give input with the focus of cleaning this system up. If any of you LOHAD traders are still out there, I am looking for a certain amount of people that would be interested in looking into this. I do not want to put this out to the thread yet until I have had some input from people who have traded this system before. The direction I took this thread was completely wrong and really became a big task in maintaning with all of the different versions I put on there. I am looking to keep this maintained and focused on what I have put together now. If you are interested in looking into this, and have had past experiance with this system, please send me a PM and we can discuss about getting you set up. Once I (and this future group) have a cleaned up release, I will put it out the thread and hopefully I will have a few more people to help maintain the thread and chat room with me. Thanks for your time guys! Lohad

just let me know if i can help lohad. i been in and out of chat but no one ever there

missed the posts. have been experimenting with the system. especially like the "fence" and find the "brain tend" signals useful. I like to use the macd (21,100,9) to identify major trend shifts by comparing different time frames. not so excited about bb macd tho... Have tried using it but like the macd (21,100,9) better. wish there were a way to develop an ea that could compare over different time frames. would certainly add a dimension to analysis...

--- 帖子 #638 ---
XBweNX, Yes I would like to send to you what I am looking into, if you are interested. I will have documentation and the template to you by this weekend. Thanks for you interest. I like the changes you made to the previous system! Lohad

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yes Jiva, MTF indi would be helpful. I have changed how I use the BBMacd quite significantly. If you would like to take a look let me know I can send to you. Maybe you can point out some tips on the the way you are using the MACD, Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi, Of course I would like to see what the modifications are. Have been working on exit strategy also. I know the tendency is not to want to give back any gains and so exiting the trade before gets a chance to run. I am seeing how to enter with 2 positions, exit 1 when that fear of giving it all back gets to be too much even though I have targets and am fairly confident the targets will be reached. I put in a stop at break even, and let the 2nd position run. At that point the 2nd position is a "free trade". Nothing to lose, keep moving the stop up checking for psar on different time frames. Am working on this. I try using a demo account but my concentrations isn't the same as live trading. So I am using a penny account with FXCM. So far I get a good gain, double or triple my investment but then I mess up and it falls back to where I started. This has happened 4 or 5 times now. The significance of the psychology of trading cannot be underestimated. MACD (21,100,9) is useful over mtf. For instance if the fast line is crossing the slow line well below the 0 line on a 1 min chart and crossing the 0 line coming from above the 0 line on the 5 min, then the move on the 1 min is just a minor rebound, the 5 min down trend is dominant. The higher time frame is always dominant. If 2 or more time frames agree, then it's a strong move and can be measured on the highest time frame that is in agreement.... Whipsaws on lower time frames can be disregarded without panicking... I am using mostly the 5min and 1 min. But I check in on 15 and 30 etc... Jiva34...

hi Lohad I think you would consider any of stochastic. if the BBMACD show the direction, then stochastic should be show the same direction too. happy trading.

Hi, Lohad, would like info on revisions to your use of macdbb. in general macd is a great trend indicator. The following charts show the strategy I have been using. 65 pips in eurjpy on Friday. But that was a no brainer since the movement was pretty obvious in the flight to safety currencies. The US equity mkt pretty well inversely correlates with USD and JPY. mkt up usd down. mkt down usd up.

Hi: We made 100.00 dollars in pennies this week. Trading the Daily chart with hourly comfirmation using PSAR 04.5.. this equals 10,000 pips. I will post a chart when I can - soon I hope We are all using variants of the same systems. I think we need to see this differently before we will have it. Made the pips simply by letting trades stay in on one PSAR change. Literally. The MACD is the AC and AO combined. at 5-34-5. We took the BB Macd 5-34-5 and put it on the chart and overlaid a QQE, Took out the bands, I don't like wavy indicators, this market does not roll, it moves in a very crooked straight line. I use a Stochastic Histogram for the the movement, not sure we needs this or how exactly we do. You can use the Histogram and keep the Signal line on there and just add the Stoachastic, all in 5-3-3 with just the signal line. This gives you the histogram of the stochastics and the /two line rolling between 80 and twenty . Just some thoughts. We use the AC and AO mostly with the Stochastics. The main part is in the price however You must know how to use the AC and the AO: The AO is the most important. When it flips over the 0 line you begin a new wave. The follow the AC when it is in line with above the AO 0 line or below. It is not just the colors. The AC will flip over the 0 as well. I am going to work on the wave and the movement with the AO this week. Get out on the AO and get in and out with the AC in the same direction. only go with the overall direction of the Daily in that wave in the same direction of the AO and AC on the hourly, you can do the same on any chart. You could use the MACD at 5-34-5 but I thin it is better with the AO and AC system. Enter with Psar and Hull, We use the Slope Direction Line V2,(Hull), Best entry we have found so far. Use the EAs for your entry only in the direction of the Daily, when you see the Ao Flipping on the hourly, turn it on. Or just enter Manually. Just what we are honing , if this helps.

Hey Stifland! How ya doin?!?!? Yes I think we are getting back in the swing of things. I am putting together a team to test out what I have. If it seems viable for the others, I will post on here. Happy Trading!

Hi, I am trying to figure this chart thing out. We figured we made 100.00 pennies last week alone. That is 10,000. Pips we think and figured. I know that sound ridiculous, but it is true. We can't believe either. It is not just the chart although I will post it. It is some market savey and basically mm and how e do it. We are still a portrait in the making if you know what I mean. Like the pips are made on 22 pairs, 5 orders each pair. Taking profit at 50 pips on each order as they advance. It is amazing.

Hi Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #661 ---
That is a picture of the hourly chart We watch the pivots on the daily, when the two MA cross and ZZ is new direction, the PSar has changed We see where the next pivot is to go to Watch the 1h or 4h retracement. Leave an EA to enter on PSAR CHANGED TO THAT DIRECITON of the Daily when the 1h change Psar back to that direction If is going down like on the chart now, it pulls back, we leave EA to go in the short position when PSar changs back We put in 5 orders at the same price. We are trying to see if an ea will take profit of 1 each order at 50 pip inccrement Right now we hand load OZFX Short or Long manually- it load sthe five independent orders all at the same price. We have a BE in a VPS using the Swiss ARmy EA to break even at 50 pips on all five. You are trading free after the first 50 pips. You want to see that you have at least 50 pips to get before the next pivot line below or above where you ma's turn on the day chart. We are trying to automate the 5 entries. The guy who made the Ea just doesn/t want to I guess. He made it a couple of years ago. We are trying an EA for entry on the psar and slope direction line olnly.. We are putting it on the 1h when we see the direction of the PSar on the Daily. Then another EA to scive off the orders and BE. We ultimately will try at least to get an ea for the Psar and Slope to enter the five orders. The fifth one we let ride out the move. We take 50 100 150 200 to equal 500 pips, then let the fifth one run with a TS We are still learning and trying out some things. Bye

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi, SusanD you may want to replace Slope Direction Line V2 to signal line.mq4

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hey SusanD, I REALLY like what you did with the QQE and BBMacd. You have me scratching my head now..... Thanks for sharing! Lohad

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thank you for the Slope, I will look at it. There are three or so versions of it around so far. We Take the Daily direction of the Psar, then each candle will trade a matching move on the 1h or 4h or both at the dame time, giving you a full compliment of the 5 orders. After you watch this between these charts, you can begin to see the market march when it is going with the match of the daily, it has one move the opposite direction on the hourly and then goes with the daily, if weekly is going in the same direction, then the moves are much bigger when they happen. We trade each daily candle in that direction on the 1h or 4h. If you get a full compliment of 500 plus the runner on mostly every candle in the PSAR , you make money. Drawbacks are, if you work, you cannot see the change on the lower charts, I have been trying to drive an Ea that only gets you in on the Direction of the Daily on the 1h on the PSAR and the Slope. I am trying another EA that I have in a VPS, that only manages the trade and skives off the orders. Another EA in the VPS brings all orders to BE. We keep them in the VPS to avoid Problems with computer or line crashes. If you want to know more, I will tell you what we are doing as we go along. I so not work. Except at this.

Hey guys, Anyone that I sent the beta version to, is anyone having issues opening my zip file? I know one person did have an issue so I had to send the files in two emails.

Hey Traders, Well there has been a little revival in this thread. I have been away for the most part lately for a couple of reasons. I have been working on this new version, and also my other business has picked up lately, so therefore taking time away from my trading. During this time I have come up with a new addition to this system. I have tested this under a forward testing basis on a live account. There has been little back testing done on this, for I prefer forward testing to include as much as the real emotions and other variables that are associated in live trading. I am releasing this to the thread to share with everyone. I am looking for input or just some good trading discussion. I am releasing this under the pretense that my trading and my other businesses are number one priority, and I will assist and answer questions as time permits me. I hope this does not sound crude, but I am just being honest. I welcome tweeks and changes to this system, however, I cannot commit that I will use them all. I am comfortable with the way the system is now, and I personally do not look to modifying it for my personal trading, but I do welcome input and ideas as usual. We have a lot of good traders out there that can offer a lot of valuable different techniques, and I welcome the sharing. I am looking to create a "co-op" type of situation here. I am not looking to be the leader here on this thread. I will freely offer my ideas in this thread, and I will try to keep this thread relevant to trading this style, and offer any new techniques that I may find. The only duty I will hold on to in this thread is keeping it clean, and the thread somewhat relevant to the LOHAD trading technique. As creator of this thread, I will hold the right to keep this thread clean and respectful with the means that I have. I will still attend the chat room as time permits. I will say that I am implementing more 5 minute trading with this style so there maybe some more time available for me to attend the chatroom. So with that being said, I am releasing the two different templates I am using for this system. With all of the indicators it will be two posts here to get all of the information needed. I can say that I am using LOHAD V3 Beta B more then A. So take a look and offer up any insight you see fit. Happy trading! Brandon (Lohad)

Here are the two templates. Go bag some pips! Brandon

Brandon, Deep thanks for all you have done in sharing and developing this thread. I have downloaded your beta B system and started using it on demo on 5 minute chart when it is in sync with higher time frame. I appreciate your perserverance in developing the lohad and taking it to new levels. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hey Stillpoint! Welcome to the thread. I hope you find this system successful. Please feel free to ask any question on here. Thanks for giving this a try, and thank you for the kind words. Let's go get them pips! Brandon

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Traders, Take a look at this. One of the initial beta testers came up with adding another BBMacd. I am not sure if this was his intention, but I laid another BBMacd on top of the original one with the setting of 8/17/8/.5 I watched this in action and it does give a good warning and another exit strat. Let us know what you think. Brandon

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Hi Lohad, Thought I post a +10 winner. I entered a bit early. Was too scared to hold on for the rest of the ride down because I don't really feel that this system has a confident exit strategy. However, I'm grateful for the pips. Thanks, revrobwimb

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Lately I have been using the MaxNonLAg MA as my exit strat. However I have been using the additional BBMacd as I posted last night, I use it to read for exits and has worked really well for me today! Thanks, Brandon

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Took 3 more during US session for a total of +65. Im done. Thanks again, revrobwimb

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Nice day of trading! Those were nice entries. Does that second BBMacd seem to help in conjunction with the MaxNonLagMA? It seems to be helping me out. Brandon

Hi foks I use Lohad system on live account and good results buy i have some lost trade and i dont know TP and SL. I have 250 $ and i play with 1 pip=1 $ but i dont know TP and SL i play TP=5 SL=5,please help with TP and SL Best regards, Petar

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi Petar Serbia! Welcome to the thread! I am glad you are having some success with the system. If you read the documentation that was posted with the latest version, you will see that I try to stick with a 5+ spread for SL. However there are several different exit strategies that you could use depending on your appetite for risk. TP is also a judgment by the trader. There are also several different TP strategies that are illustrated in the documentation. Remember this is primarily designed to be a scalping system, however I have been finding that tihs can be useful for longer intra day trades as well. But a take profit of 10 is ideal as well. Personally Petar, I think you are trading to much money for the account size, but that is just me. I am not one to tell anyone how to handle their money, but trading $1.00/Pip on a $250 account is too aggressive for my taste. Please feel free to ask more questions. Thanks, Brandon

can't seem to get enough time in. Love trading. Not very successful, but determined... Am finally developing an appreciation for BBMACD. And using smarter money management. Not able to keep up with all the newer and newer and innovations here in LOHAD. But little by little assimilating. Have strayed a bit to other threads. Yikes information overload. Am honing skills. Put a 10 pip stop in. That's it. If stops out. Move on. Minimum profit target 20 pips. Good entry essential. This discipline of taking the loss at 10 pips is very important. Risking 10 to make 20 is a serious discipline. Not so easy. Temptation to stretch things a bit. Oh it's gonna turn around and go my way... meanwhile 50 pips or more later still waiting for it to turn around. Uh, uh. No good. take the 10 pip loss and move on. Sharpen entry skills. tough day, eurusd meandered endlessly... in sync with US stocks... I'm using a mix of indicators and signals, older versions... jiva... one trade that went very right.... from planning to completion, gave me some hope that I can get better at this....

hey lohad just starting your new version let you know how it works out

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hey Jiva! Keep working on it! Learning how important it is to just cut your losses short is a huge step to success! Sounds like you are on the right track. I am glad that you are mixing and matching the different versions here. That is what this is about! Seeing if we can find that golden combination! Keep in touch with your progress and let me know if you find any different angles of looking at this system! It good to hear from ya! Lohad

Hey xBweNx!, Thanks for giving it a spin! Let me know what you think. It has worked really well for me! Looking forward to your feedback! Lohad

--- 帖子 #683 ---
hey lohad could you give me more info on the stoch. beside the basic stoch knowledge coming from overbought/oversold area and cross.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
xBweNx, The Dynamic Stoch Zone is basically a combination of a Stoch and BBands. I mainly use it for confirmation of entry, and only keep an eye on it for exits, but not solely use it for exits. So I am looking for the cross (of the "stoch" ) at areas like the outer Bbands and across the center one. I hope this makes sense. I have also just used this with a regular Stoch 14,3,3 if you prefer that. It works as well. Thanks! Brandon

May have stumbled onto something that started out as a joke.. no candles, bars, or lines, just heiken ashi smoothed and 2 bbmacds. macd (12,26,9) and macd (21,100,9) [the long term bbmacd smooths out the chatter, when there is a cross on that bbmacdd the trend is definitely defined...] the brain trend signaler the signal line and 200 ema, 100 ema the two trades I placed so far using this kis were both profitable. My stress level sank to near zero. Just watching the gyrations of price movement on the 1m is enough to give someone a nervous breakdown. using heiken ashi smoothed there's none of that.... I am looking how to trail the stop under the hk. Since it is always progressive in the direction of the trend... Will be working on this. (If comcast will let me, the service keeps cutting in and out. This has been going on ever since I subscribed to comcast 2 years ago. Umpteen service reps have been here, they claim to fix the problem but here it is again. We're going to try switching out the modem this time. Comcast costs a small fortune and they can't keep my service on. Wouldn't be so bad but it cuts out sometimes in the middle of placing a trade or worse yet trying to close one!!! I got so desperate I even considered DSL from AT&amp;T. But when they sent me the box filled with gadgets and software that I would need to figure out how to install, I sent it back. Rock and a hard place....I'd almost forgotten how awful it is trying to deal with AT&amp;T, but I remembered in the nick of time.....) I use 2 charts. I trade with a micro account from FXCM . that's the completely blank one...($.10/pip) great for learners.... But I track the trade with mt4..... kis... jiva...

using line chart. 1 min is too volatile for candles to have much significance. Even bb doesn't follow the standard rules because of the volatility on a 1 min. can try to adjust settings, 2.5 std, but still the rules just don't hold very well. this is the chart I am using... there is an indicator on FXCM trading station demo that gives excellent signals, it's called eliot wave indicators. it's either +1 or -1. in uptrend buy a -1 in downtrend sell +1. With tight stops... really good. no bbmacd. I hope this thread isn't only for bbmacd. I didn't use it today, but since my trading strategy is in development that doesn't mean I might not pick it up again next week with some new angle of vision. Picked up the trix somewhere or other while surfing. Maybe it was here? keep the home fires burning good luck... jiva..

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hey Jiva, Thank you for all of the input! Typically I will use all of my variations of the system and include the BBMacd. It is what I feel most comfortable with. But by no means do I want this to deter you from posting your ideas. I am picking up a lot of good ideas fro you to test and try out. I will just add the BBMacd on my own. So please keep posting your ideas. I like to think of this thread as a Forex Playground. I am going to look into line charts and I am also real curious on the Heiken Ashi Smoothed idea for a replacement of the candles. Thanks again for all of your help! I should be more involved with the thread next week as I will have more time to trade then.! Lohad

Am finding this thread inspiring. I will be honest. I have been plugging away at this for 4 years. I know I can do it. Practicing. Studying. Learning. It is so vast. It is requires scientific exploration. Love it. I know the profit will come. I am getting closer everyday to putting it all together and getting it to fly. This thread has been most helpful. The ideas of others. Take what you can use and leave the rest. The following is a link with some neat videos on tech analysis. Some of it is pretty elementary, but the way it is presented has a refreshing quality. I try to take advantage of whatever someone is sharing. http://www.fxclub.com/essential/ The trading opportunity really is pioneering. Great stuff. The gold rush of this century if you will. the new frontier. nuggets here and there looking for the big vein.. After viewing the video on indicators (it's a shortened teaser for you to join fxclub) it was enough to get me to try something. Am working on it today. They show stoch buy and sell signals, by identifying the stoch on a higher time frame and then only trading in the direction of the higher time frame trend on a lower time frame. But what I am experimenting with is the signal line. It's shows more clearly the changes of direction. On the 30 minute I draw red or green vertical lines marking the up or down signal given by the signal line. These are solid lines. The main trend lines. Then on the 15 minute I draw red or green lines (dashed) to identity sub trends. Then I trade on the 1 minute using the bbmacd and macd 12,26,9 and macd 21,100,9 to help identify directional shifting. It looks good so far in backtesting. I wish mt4 had a scroll lock function. When the market is open every new trade causes the chart to scroll to the present moment. Using offline is virtually impossible to test multi time frames since each chart is an independent entity and lines drawn on it can't be carried over to another time frame. My demo acct with FXCM has a lock function, but the charts aren't as easy to look at. mt4 is so neat and clean. The value of association in trying to do anything can't be overestimated. Good association that is.. I'm lucky to have found this thread. Thank you. Jiva.. Charts in backtest: This trade would have taken 3hrs and 15 mins. I know that is heck of a long time for a scalper, but it would have brought in more than 90 pips just strictly adhering to the signals.

been back testing this all day. Not one losing trade......... Even tried it with no regular chart visible and in a semi consolidating pattern. No indicators. Just the signal line on the different time frames and went back in after marking the entries and exits to see what prices were, and even taking a fill at the worst price, the profits were there. I can't wait until markets open and I can demo this in the active markets... It couldn't be this simple, could it??????????????????? jiva...

Hey Tex! Long time buddy! Hows trading going? Yes the thread is still kicking. Yes please try the new version it has performed really well for me. I look forward to hearing your feedback.

jiva, Can you please post the template and indicators you're using in this chart? I'd like to give this method a try between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm Eastern to see if I can make some pips. I guess the pic didn't post. I was referring to your post #686. Thanks rptrader

--- 帖子 #696 ---
The signal line is the same one we've used before. I have added bars to the chart since it was difficult to see when the line colors change. It would look like the green ends had turned red and was giving a signal. But since the increment had not closed it would turned back to green. So I ended up entering the trade too early. Was lucky and squeaked out a little gain... Also added the bbmacd for further clarification. And 200 ema. I want to win the "King of the Micro monthly contest at fxcm for microlot traders. Winners traditionally rack up 1500% gains. And take home a nice cash prize, $5000. Their trading logs are posted. wannago back through their entrances and exits and see if I can find a clue about their signals. That 1500% is pretty regular every month. There are 4 winners every month that get lesser prizes.

Hi jiva34, u did not post the template along side indicators. Am following u.Thanks for sharing. Real pips.

Hi there Jiva34! Please forgive my ignorance and somewhat daft post (having a few lately!!), but is it not just a matter of adding the 30min signal line and the 15 min signal line to the 1 min chart? 3 lots of signal lines with varying settings to correspond to individual time frames. Hence when they're all green - buy and sell when all red. Cheers! Ron

Realpips, slogging along... had three winning trades, small gains. as I get more confident with practice I will stay in the trade longer. what I am seeing is that identifying the trends and subtrends are necessary no matter what system one is using. The moves in the subtrends are not as strong. So an indicator can show a move developing in a subtrend but it has no momentum behind it and may not even pay for the spread cost for entering. So the signals to look for need to be going with the main trend for high probability. How to tell the difference between a minor correction and a possible reversal. Using the signal line over different time frames is very helpful to identify the trends. I am using the 30. to find a main trend and the 15 to find a subtrend. Then going to the 1 min to find good entry and good exits. The bbmacd gives a good indication of the strength as well to reaffirm the direction of the moves. A move counter to the main trend on the 15 could be the start of a reversal, but this can be discovered by the bbmacd. None of this is set in stone but is what I am working on. Makes sense to me. Great book that changed my whole way of seeing market movements is JM Hurst, Profit Magic from Market Timing. He was a physicist who became fascinated by the market in the 30's I think. Anyway it was well before computers. All his calcs were manually done. Yikes. Labor intensive, so you know he'd been bitten by the market bug real bad..... But his reasonings based on physics were revolutionary and have influenced technical analysis to this day. Some call him the Father of TA. I especially appreciate his spelling out "linear movements in curvilinear space" with great illustrations as a way to describe how double tops, flags, triangles, etc come about. He also discusses time frame comparisons...and cyclical trading... It's not a "how to book", but it gives a great look at the physics of the market place.

Thanks Ron you know I'm gonna check it out. The best charts are the least cluttered. If that can cut down on clutter I'm into it. jiva

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Been testing that, Ron. But it's not the same as identifying a trend on the minute chart. think about it, each bar or candle represents activity for a certain amt of time. On a thirty minute chart a signal line or a 30 ma would account for say the last 30 bars or candles (each composed of 30 minutes of activity), not just the last 30 minutes, like a 30 ma on a 1 min chart would. The best thing I've found so far is to place a color coded vertical line through the bar on the 30 minute (only after it closes) and use that marking on the 15m, 5m and 1m to identify the trends and subtrends... This is the most exciting thing I've come across. The bbmacd helps to show the strength and reaffirm the direction of the trends and subtrends. I'm gonna stick with this a while. Practice practice practice. The 10000hour rule makes a lot of sense. Can't expect and kind of expertise with less than 10000 hours of practice. Hey, pilots have to accumulate flying hours, right! Doctors have to put in internship hours. I'm attaching all the indicators needed. maximum of 7 files can be attached so the template will follow in the next post...(there's a way to upload a folder but haven't figured that out) jiva...

am giving a 2 signal cross idea another shot. The signal lines catch the moves fairly quickly. The settings for signal lines are 15 lwma and 30 lwma. The chart shows good entry points on the way up and the trend break and entry point for a retracement. target is set just above fib 50. bbmacd confirms a retracement 1 m bbmacd not quite confirming the retracement 5 M, maybe got in a little too early... (it's the demo acct) but this is the idea... the trade was good... okay looks like this is the strategy for tomorrow. Thanks Ron for pointing this out....

--- 帖子 #704 ---
not imagining things. here is that same set up again... jeez, should a stayed in........

--- 帖子 #705 ---
You're catching some nice moves there Jiva34, I was going to suggest using other indicators to keep you out of ranging markets, but then remembered the BBMACD which does this as well!! Also, I remember one of my first few lessons I had early in my career - always aim to catch a move with loads of energy/power/volume behind it as the weak ones hardly ever get far. With that in mind, again forgive my ignorance, would volume analysis be of any use to this method? I understand the whole concept of having a considerably large gap between the latest and previous dot on the BBMACD, but I'm still looking for a measure of strength in the move. Just a thought..... Then silly me remembers we are scalping afterall, hence aiming for a quick 5-10 pip profit so we aren't necessarily looking for the strongest move. Ron.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Hi Ron, Your input made a huge difference. About the signal line crosses. It appears that the signal lines are more closely correlated to the actual price movements, without all the whipsaws and seesaws, whereas the bbmacd is useful as a broader range indicator. The 2 together are nice combo. In equities the volume is easily seen, but trying to use the volume indicator in the mt4 program doesn't seem to show anything. Maybe a volume based oscillator, or the momentum indicator. It could be helpful at least avoid a false move, like if there is very little volume but the price spikes, well just might want to pass on that. Gonna spend today test driving the above strategy. 3 live trades in my micro account this am all winners. The interesting thing about the template is how vividly it highlights the pullbacks and the reversals. I'd always tried to guage using the 20sma, the one down the middle of the bol bands, but this 30 lwma signal line is right there to catch the pullbacks. Who could ask for anything more!!! Probably won't get back to the market until the Asian session tonight. I hate to miss London but I'm working 3rd shift and just as London cranks up into high gear I'm setting up the breakfast at the motel. Frustrating as anything. My escape from "motel hell" depends on me getting the trading off the ground but during the best time to trade I'm moteling instead. Asian session, tonight. US session not possible today. Will dabble around with volumes and oscillators, momentums, etc to see what I can find. Thanks for the input. May your day be full of pips... jiva..

Hey guys, This is how I have playing this as well. It seems to work really well for me. Also has given me some great confidence on a M5 chart with a 20 pip stop. Basically it is a double BBMacd, Itrend with inlayed Stoch, There is a Non Lag set at 25 and a SMHullMA set at 55. I have been playing the crosses or the "weave" going with trend. Lohad

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Here's a trade in progress using this strategy. goal is to get a free trade status. open 2 mini lots, take profit at first pullback, move stop to break even. nothing to lose... let the 2nd position ride. if it stops out, oh well... already have taken profit on 1st position. If my analysis is correct, the pullback will be minor and the longer range goal is valid for 2nd position.... at no risk.... so far so good...here's the history in charts up to now...

Nice trade jiva! Thanks for sharing. rptrader

I don't mean to clutter up this thread. It helps me to document my trading, so that each move is calculated. no panic stuff.... looks like the 2nd position got stopped out. placed the stop too low. would like to follow someone else's trades in pics if they would like to share learn so much from the efforts of others...

Brilliant trades Jiva34! Looks like 'you're in the zone' with this. As for posting trades, I would love to, trouble is I use a very different method, hardly ever use BBMACD at all. I've gathered various tools that fit my style from various forums and if you all don't mind (Lohad, Jiva34 and the rest of the gang)- i'l post a few of my trades? Happy pipping to all! Ron

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hey Jiva, Nice trading! I am glad to see that you are posting your ideas, I have gained some more knowledge from what you are working on. I have adapted some of your ideas into my trading arsenal. Thanks for the tips. I will be posting what I am working on and how I am using the BBMacd to help me along. Thanks again and keep bagging them pips! Good Job! Lohad

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Please posts your ideas Ron! Like you, I adapt different ideas from other places and put my spin on it. I may decide to see if the BBMacd can work with what you are working with, if you don't mind. I would be interested to see your system if you choose to post. Thanks Lohad

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hi Ron, Please post. That's what it's all about. Can hardly wait to see. Your ideas have been right on so far. Even ideas that aren't so right on can help... jiva.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Here's something I experienced and it makes sense to me. Don't know if this is the thread to pursue this. Please let me know if I am in the wrong pasture.. The last few trades I posted were great. I entered them knowing I would be posting and documenting as they developed. I felt I was right on following the new strategy and and knew that traders with varying degrees of expertise would be viewing them and possibly giving some critique. Just being in that mind set kept me from getting off track. I had 2 winners in a row. Right on the strategy no straying, no distraction, focused. Then I tried a few trades just to trade. Not thinking I would be documenting them for other traders to see. What a mess. I gave all my gains back plus some. So I asked myself what was the difference between the winners and losers? It is the same currencies, the same buy and sell, the same strategy, the same ma's, signal lines, bmacd....What was the difference? The difference was my psychology!!!!!!!!!! In the first case, the winners, I knew others would see my moves. In the second case no one would see. I'm going to need to document my trades for others to see in order to protect myself from myself!!!!! At some point I am expecting that I will internalize the voice of others, "why did you buy at that point?" "what about volume?" "was that a valid signal?" Alone I think I am projecting my desires onto the market rather than really reading what the market is telling me. But with documentation that will be seen by others I have to be more accountable for my decisions. Why did I do such and such. What kind of strategy would it be to simply say "I thought it was going up!!!" Which is what I easily slip into trading alone. It got so far afield that I couldn't even remember what the strategy was. I had to research just to find the right template. Before you know it the charts started to look like some of the one's posted below. So what I am wondering is if I may be allowed to post my trades here as they progress or if that would take up too much space or conflict with another idea of a continuum for this thread. I like the mood that has been set here. Open and enthusiastic but if this is too far from the idea of the thread I would have to post somewhere else. Let me know if it is okay. Anyway here are some of the wacky charts that threw me way off when I wasn't documenting my moves. They got more and more cluttered and confusing.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Many thanks guys. Got a few woes that need to be sorted out by the end of the week, result being, I haven't traded today and wont tomorrow. Quick note though - just as Jiva34 uses the signal lines representing sentiment on different time frames, I use a similar approach. I use the kino_T3MA ribbons (compliments to him and the whole team on the 'FX50 Great Scalping Thread'). Have a read of posts from pages 100 onwards on that thread if you're interested. As a result of the ribbons, I don't even look at the M5+ charts. CCI21, CCI89 and the FX prime bars are also in my setup - again documented in that thread. As I mentioned before, volume plays a major part with my trades. Have a look at Waddah Attar Explosion indi which does show how much thrust is in a move. Or if you're keen, research on Volume Spread Analysis over the weekend! I guarantee you will appreciate the part volume plays in the market. I also use a smoothed heiken ashi - which I'm looking to replace with a single signal line, might be convinced to using 2 though. Another approach I use on another chart (when bored of looking at the above setup!!) - I remove the CCI's and the FX Prime bars, add the THV trix histo bars (M1 to M15) as well as the Trix. Buy when all green on the trix bars and sell when all are red with Waddah above signal lines. (Many thanks Cobra and co... Buy ya all a pint if you happen to drop buy in sunny old England, give us a PM anytime) That's all I use on the M1 timeframe. I do trade the 4HR chart and other time frames, but I reckon that would be off topic on this thread. That about covers it. By all means not the 'Holy Grail!' as I can go for a few days in the negative with these methods but they seem to be working for me compared to other methods. Oh Darn - Look what you've made me do now !! I'm meant to be focused on other things but you've got me talking about my set ups and we all know what happens. Couldn't resist the two trades A and B - bagged a few pips. I'm off now, happy reading if you're going to follow up on those threads. (I read them from start to end over and over for a few weeks! And I still do!) PS - Sorry if my post and chart are too confusing! Zig-Zags - see how they give me a general view of the trend! as I write, look how price reacted! Nicely nicely.

Lithography -Surprisingly, yes I did venture into the realms of lithography as a hobby many moons ago- then discovered trading so that was short lived! Perhaps i'l look at it when life permits. At the moment I'm engrossed in stone masonry and wood carving (needless to say the missus is always on the war path with my tools all over the garden!) Would love to learn programming though. I'm always vexed when you lot start talking in tongues! As for my scalping, as much as the afore mentioned methods work for me, please don't disregard what you've been working on. There are plenty of threads talking of THV and FX 50 on a host of forums and it would be a shame if we disregard the great work/effort everyone has put into what could be a successful system. Lord, i'm going on again, there's no shutting me up- trouble with being too passionate! Anyhow, nite nite and happy pippin! Ron.

Actually, just by thinking that other traders might critique my trades is helping me. The fact is because I'm trading on the 1 minute it happens so quickly I don't always have the time to document the trade. But just by thinking like that it is helping. I'm having to keep things as simple as possible. this was a trade that didn't go quite as I envisioned. Actually it did move a little bit more in the anticipated direction but only later. I exited as the first sign of any profit, the consolidation phase had more or less set in and the down trend indicators were neutralized. entered on what looked like a possible double top on the 1m with bbmacd confirming. but bbmacd on the 5m didn't confirm so I anticipated a a weak move. later into the trade it was indeed a weak move and simply went into consolidation. managed to get out with a small profit, at least not a loss.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Ron what should I be looking for in volumes. Also where are the volumes coming from since there is no central clearing house for forex. Are the volumes calculated from users of MT4? Your charts are breathtaking, really. No joke. I wouldn't be surprised to see one on display in a cultural center for the arts. Someone would definitely want to buy it. Neat thing is you would never run out of material for a sequel, each one could be unique just wait a couple of minutes or switch from time frame to time frame. You know there has to be some form of art coming out of this mass involvement in online trading. Maybe that's you. Picasso of the forex. I'm so easily distracted am having to keep things a simple as possible. More than 2 or 3 lines on the chart and I'm cross-eyed. But am always open to try to learn something. A little slow, but once I've got it, I'VE GOT IT!! There is just not enough time. Am hardly eating or sleeping as it is.... Little bit little bit.. jiva

end of US session trade. lots of times there will be a significant move at the end of the day. Today it was a bit of retracement. I use another charting program and actually trade micro from that platform, the FXCM micro marketscope. It's really neat because you can trade right from the charts with point and click. There is very accurate pivot point indicator which is remarkable in predicting where and how far a move will go. So with the USDJPY the move went to r2 and magically stopped there and retraced. medians are significant also, not shown in the chart that follows. MTV is the best for actually calculating. very clear to see. and of course the ability to write programs for it is fantastic. but I find marketscope useful for pivot points and actually placing trades. There is a way to program pivot point into mt4 but I rather not clutter up the charts with them and just have a special chart for that separate.

Yes you're absolutely right! No central clearing house so no volumes. Again, pardon my ignorance, 'trend strength' would be more apt I reckon. Question though, in the spirit of learning something new a day , what does the default volume indi on the platform measure? I've just added this to my chart to see if there's any visual correlation between the 2, will update next week. How I interprete the indi: A bar (red or green) above the dead zone (above the horizontal line) and above the yellow line represents strong sentiment with the bulls/bears in a move. With that, one can also 'assume' that a lot of volume will be transacted in the direction of the trend. Below the dead zone (below horizontal line) one can also 'assume' less volume being transacted and the bulls/bears are at logger heads in deciding which way to go. (thinking about it - what would be the case of equally large volumes? I should go to bed now before I go insane!) 'Trend and volume' - the missus whispers! Waddar itself was intended for use with higher timeframes, but has filtered out some of my undesirables on the M1 timeframe. Note though, even without a strong thrust above the dead zone, there are some 'pippable' moves and the opposite is true. A strong thrust might be signalled but the move will not materialise, thus not a good 'stand - alone indi'. Here's a brief read on it - http://www.forex-tsd.com/indicators-...indicator.html from which I quote - " How to use the indicator: 1) The yellow line is used to recognize when the explosion starts and when it ends. the explosion starts when the yellow line is low. as long as the yellow line is high the explosion is still running on the price explosion ends when the yellow line is back low inside the dots zone the yellow line job is identifying the explosion starts and ends. 2) The green histogram: has three uses: first, gives a signal when price explose upward (bullish move) second, gives the buying signal, when the green histo rises above the yellow line. third, gives the exist signal, when the a green histo slip back into the yellow line 3)The green histogram: has three uses: first, gives a signal when prise explose downward (bearish move) second, gives the sell signal, when the red histo rises above the yellow line third, gives the exist signal, when the red histo slip back into the yellow line Explanation for the Price Explosion indicator: The indicator depends on two things to show the data and the lines in chart 1) The deference between the uper and lower band of the bollinger band which tight when the price fluctuates (narrow move) when the difference between the bands expand, the explosion process starts and the yellow line curve upward till the explosion ends and price fluctuate again 2) The difference between the present value of the macd and the last value with one tick for the same candle this deference is represented in the green and the red histogram. " And the technicalities of what measures what - way over my head (different lingo ) Hope this helps somewhat! Nite nite. Ron

plan to do research some time during the weekend. Ron has posted some interesting leads and indicators also. I like trading on the 1 min because it moves so quickly. I am thinking that whatever signal systems work consistently on the 1 min could be tested out on higher time frames. But by using the min, the results are quick. That's why they use the fruit fly in so many experiments (poor fruit fly) has the loife span of a few miunutes. So they can test for the effects of whatever through several generations in a matter of hours. great stuff this open currency market... Here's to the free world and "reasonable" regulators. jiva

If trading was so easy everyone would be a zillionaire by now. Some people are very successful so it can be done. Some people can run the 4 minute mile too. I'm somewhere in the back of the pack trying to stay in the race. But I found a neat article by a "professional" scalper. They don't always just give away their hard earned treasures. But this one was generous. Unfortunately the article appears in SFO, a paper mag. and is not postable in the forum. The trader discusses 2 systems and gives example of the strategies. First, a high probability system (very short term- that's for me!!!) and then a high profitability system (a little longer term). the high probability one is very, very simple (that's for me too). No fibs, no TFs, no PPs, no muss, no fuss, no clutter.............................................................................................. I posted back tested charts showing it in action. Testing on 6 consecutive trades for 5 out of 6 wins. You know I'm all over it Monday, maybe even Asia on Sunday... It's a good thing forex is closed for a little while, otherwise I would have no clean clothes and nothing cooked to eat. (If I don't start showing a profit that may happen anyway!!!) The strategy is like this: Use MACD OsMA. 20 sma. When OsMa crosses zero look for a cross and close in the direction of OsMA within 5 bars... I use a limit order 1 tick above close in up and 1 tick below close in down. (I'm sick of market orders) set stop and limit for same amt of pips. I used 20. Because it is high probability 2:1 is not necessary and may even spoil some trades. 1:1 works best for total wins in a series of trades. Can't seem to get away from MACD in some form or other...

Hey Traders, I wanted to talk about this sooner but I was out for a couple days on business. But better late then never. I have been trying something new and incorporating what I know about my BBMacd trading style and it is the best thing I have found to work for me personally so far. I traded this live only one morning (Thursday - London Session) and I have been running simulator since and I will say that me personally I am running 90%. Could be a fluke I know, but I find this so far has given me the greatest ease trading M1 charts. What I am about to say also worked well for me on M5 trades as well. I will admit that I am leaving too much on the table, but regardless still getting enough to achieve way more then my daily goal of 30. This system incorporated with mine will give less entries but more solid entries. It does get you in later then my would but hey, I would rather be in a more higher rate situation. Very easy to trade multiple pairs for me (EU. GU, EJ). The thread I suggest you need to look at is http://www.forexfactory.com/images/misc/paperclip.gif EUR/GBP Trendmagic System. The indicators by Tudor Girl I have found to be really good. I will be posting any ideas on how I trade her indicator on their thread, but please if you go to their thread and post trading ideas, be very respectfull in not hi-jacking Paulus's thread. They are trying real hard to not let their thread stray and plaese respect that. Also, please post your ideas on how this is working for you on this thread, but please NO ONE post Tudor Girls Indi on here. She clearly explained to me that she would prefer to keep her work in one spot, and I agree. I will be posting on both here and their thread but I will be consious on what I am posting on each thread. So check it out. It is very impressive. Thanks to Paulus and Tudor Girl for sharing their findings. It has made my trading so much better! Lohad

--- 帖子 #733 ---
This is a screen shot of what I have been using. Working really well. You will have to get the indi's in the other thread. There can be no posting of Tudor Girls indicators in here. I will use this thread in discussing how I am using the BBMacd in correlation with this new tool. I know her development is new so with her indicators, time will tell if this is a fluke, but from the get go, I am quite impressed so far. Lohad

I like the idea behind the strategy. High probability, low risk. tracked 3 different currencies in back test and gains were there. about 70 out of 100. Resigning myself that it's either high risk and high profit. Or low risk and low profit. I'm ready for low risk... Have been reading up on adrenaline blowout... Low risk... Or probably die... Charts show the idea behind the strategy. I am using the signal line on the 5 minute to identify the 5m trend, drawing the vertical line on the 5 min and trading on the 1 minute. If the 5 m trend is up I consider only up crosses on the 1 min (unless bbmacd is signaling a reversal, then I may enter short even though 5 m trend is up.) There is a 200ema on the chart also but it doesn't show on the charts below because it is so far out of the picture. The idea is to increase the probability as much as possible and be satisfied with several winning moves that are small gains. For obvious breakouts and big runs I have used fractal entries successfully. Wait for the next fractal and while the pullback is going on place an order just above the fractal for uptrend or just below the fractal for down trend, go in for 10 pips. Using the same 10 pip stop/10 pip limit strategy. Am able to capture some of a big move that way. a 10 pip move on the 1 min is respectable...and fairly easy to achieve.

Hey Jiva, Nice Setup!. I am still messing around with what I posted over the weekend, playing with the different aspects of the BBMacd. I will keep you posted on my findings, but I am liking what I am seeing. Keep up the good work! This thread appreciates it! Lohad

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Java34, did backtested this manualy, or 70% is real life results? In manual backtesting keep in mind, that you have to push the vertical line 4 bars to the right. Because 7:15 bar on 5min TF means that this bar opens at 7:15 and closes at 7:20. So you have to find on the 1min chart the 7:19 bar (opens at 7:19 and closes at 7:20), and this bar is corresponding to the closing values of indicators on your vertical line on 5min chart. Take a look on charts.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
backtesting doesn't give the same results as demo in live market for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is the temptation do go back and place a trade not seen at first. Also what you are pointing out, previous post, about time synchronizing. Just can give some overall idea of the strategy... As it turned out, I spent all Mon morning in live demo testing for the 20sma/OsMA cross strategy explained by the pro in SFO. But you know they didn't give the whole story...... There has to be more to it. In live demo is flopped over and over again. But I did take away a few lessons. The significance of the differenc between a high probability strategy and a high profit strategy and how to gear up psychologically for trading using either, according to time and circumstance. As it turned out I still collected 37 pips in my real account but only after ai ditched the morning's template and took up some old indicators with a new outlook on using them. Until I get better at this, practice makes perfect, thank God for demo accounts, I plan to use the demo to my hearts content and when I happen to come accross a beauty, a winner, a breakout or an unmistable reversal, then I will trade it for real. I love trading. So I plan to work the demo accounts like anything, but only when I find a real find will I put real money behind it. This keeps me involved in the market and ready to jump a find.. This is the template I used in afternoon that got me the gains. It went great. And I'll pick up where I left off tomorrow. The idea is to wait for braintrend buy/sell signal on 1m, check 5m to see if braintrend agrees, buy signal 1m and buy signal 5m, buy. 10 or 15 pip stop, 10,15 or 20 pip limit. Walk away.... Like logging. Make the cuts and walk away. If the cuts were done correctly the tree lands where it you planned, if not plan on getting a new roof... That's the idea, but have to admit when I saw profits I closed a little early, although the prices did eventually reach the limits 2 out of 3 of the times. The heiken-ashi smoothed illustrates so beautifully the trend, makes it so easy to identify. That and the brain trend signal are it for now. oh and bbmacd, 2 settings the long setting to confirm the overall trend and the short term to confirm entries.

Thank you, Lohad for the encouragement. I will eventually get to checkout the system and threads you suggested. Slow brain here. Overloads easily. But I always file away for future use. Thank you for sharing. It is not unappreciated. As you can see I'm working indicators and techniques you've shared and it is making a difference. So if you find it put it here.... We'll take it... Thankfully...... If we don't hear from you, we'll know you've become so absorbed in raking in millions that you no longer have a need for the incubator.

Jiva, Thank you for the nice words. I am glad you are pulling old tools from the tool box and implementing with your new findings. Sounds like it's making you some good pips! Wait until you see what I have done with the BBMacd! I do not like to sound like I am bragging but I am really impressed with the performance of this new tool in it's infant stage of testing. I am going to test the London session with it and then I will post it along with what I find as far as drawbacks and possibilities with this new way of using BBMacd. I will post it today. Keep up the fight Jiva! You, heck WE are getting there! Take a look at the history of all your posts and see the improvement of what I see in how you are working with the markets! Nowhere near a million but we will get there and we'll share every step of the way! Lohad

traded all day only 7 pips.. at least not a loss am looking at combining a fractal signal to catch breakouts. looks like 2 events bring a quick gain, breakout and reversal. fractal catches breakouts ( good for 10 pips min) by placing entry order just above the breakout (for long), and bbmacd confirms signals nicely for reversals... long slog.... keep us up to date with your finds... much appreciated. will be analyzing the trading history for the winner of the micro contest (1200%) looking for correlations with indicators, etc for the entries and exits...it's not just a fluke, this happens every month and there are 5 winners every month, top is usually around 1200% the others around the same just a little less, like low man is 1000%.. They're onto something.... What the heck is it?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
didn't get a chance to research the trading history of the contest winners, still looking for some time to do that. experimented with a great tool. surfing the forums, found a trader who has posted a indicator that will superimpose a candle from a higher time frame over the trading action on a lower time frame. WOW. what fun to watch the candle form. nice insight on the trend of the pair for making decisions on the lower frames. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=172963&amp;page=3 nice simple system too, makes a lot of sense to watch the candle sticks no matter what strategy might otherwise be used. broke even today. it's so weird to look back over the day's charts and see these huge moves. And I missed them. Like when they are happening I'm lost in a forest and all I can see are trees.... Can't see the whole forest. practice practice practice.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi, Lohad if you think I should remove this post please pm me thank you! sorry I know I should not hijack the thread but... if you want to know breakout and when trend is end using following indicators ADX Aroon WPR (Wailliams' Percent R) Stochastic Super Signal (this one for your guide only) Signal Line other indicator you might want to using nxMACD Rads' sMAC-D(put this one over nxMACD) not with alert one Rule Aroon show end (check on my thread to see how to read them) and super signal printed on chart WPR start going to center and stochastic should crossover soon (if color stochastic should change color and direction) when all three indicator above comfirmed nxMACD should change color(one color by default is black so change it) Signal Line and color stochastic(if use) should change color ADX (DI+ and DI- the gap should start to close soon) DI+ buyer DI- Seller Rads' sMAC-D should cross over soon. note: nxMACD(like most of MACD when it below 0 when it cross down trend continue so when it above up trend continue) all indicators you may find in my system except 3 below ADX ( DMI.mq4 ) nxMACD.ex4 WPR Alert.mq4

over 2000%..... from $500 May 1st to over $10000 May 31st. don't you know I wanna know what that trader is doing!!!!!!! interviewed he said he uses macd and something called KDJ(?) whatever that is. attaching a copy of the trading history. looks like he took a zillion small losses (it's a micro account) $.04, $.10, etc. and waited for just right trades and rode them forever... He knew what he was looking for.............

--- 帖子 #745 ---
over 1700%. traded a million small trades.. no one profit over $300 or $400. Looks like the trader got much better as the month neared the end. Serious losses in the beginning. ended up starting $500 ending profit over $8800. This can be done....... others are doing it. I wanna know what they are doing...... I traded all day and lost 10 pips.... I have all the pieces. I need to be able to put it all together. And get it off the ground.... I've tried to use the charts to go back and see if I can identify entries and exits that correlate with indicators, etc. but the software won't go back that far on the 1 min. we'll get to the bottom if it....

--- 帖子 #746 ---
very good statement for that guy... KDJ is stochastic in meta4 done search on google show in chinese as KDJ indcator however all is stochastic as I told you if you want study following indicator Aroon ADX WPR Stochastic(KDJ) for basic rule Aroon show end WPR should moving to center ADX should start closing the gap between DI+ and DI- Stochastic should cross over if meet, trend is comfirmed as long as you understand them you should win every time on your trade.

on 5min osma cross close above (long) or below (short) 20 sma braintrend signal all signals met check 1 min for fresh cross of osma, sma 20 and brain trend place 2 mini lots close 1 after 10 pips initial stop below h-k or 10 pips whichever is more... place stop for second mini at break even. trailing stop if it keeps going... (the big candles are the 60 min superimposed, neat stuff)

will take some time this weekend to study the indis as you suggest. there were huge moves today in gbp and jpy. I missed the whole thing. the times of day make a huge difference. When data is announced like at 8:30 am est and 10 am est for USD the markets set their direction for the day. the charts I used towards the end of the day helped a whole lot to identify the trend and when not much was going on, I managed to make back almost as much as I had lost earlier. I use a micro account purposefully. $.10 per pip . I wouldn't dream of putting any serious funds into this until I am steadily showing gains. So between the demo and the micro I am practicing. tuppers, are you coming out ahead with this? Would you post a chart and templates and indis so that I can test drive your setup? Explain stuff I might need to know. If you're successful with this I want to learn from you. LOHAD is pretty cool. I don't think he will consider this inappropriate for his thread. If he does he'll let us know. He posted earlier that he wants to keep this thread open for exchange of ideas. thanks for the help. jiva...

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Mtuppers, Jiva is right. I do not care about about what you post. In the beginning I was a little uptight about this a little because I was focusing on creating a system and trying to stick by the rules. But let's be honest, the LOHAD system is created by deviating from a bunch of different systems. It created a system that made PA look clearer to me. So why would I want to block someone to create their system by doing the same thing that I have done? Also, I get a huge benifet of trying all your ideas. I am a BBMacd fan. I know it inside and out. If I find something you guys are trying out and it works with my theories, then it is just another tool in my toolbox. I ackowledge and I am greatful when I see effort from traders like you and Jiva, your ideas has spun several ideas for myself. So if you have something working for you, please post. I consider this thread like a 4X playground. As a matter of fact I am going to release a new system (theory) this weekend. Just putting together the final touches. And honestly I may start a new thread for that. And if I create a new thread for this one, I may keep that one system specific, and utilize this one as our chalk board to post ideas and see if they stick. Thanks you for all the effort and genourosity of sharing your ideas here. Keep your eyes open for the new system. I am getting excited to show what I cut and pasted together for this system. Some of you may like it. Have a great weekend! Lohad

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hi there, I have been lurking in the background, watching and live testing (on demo account) the LOHAD system for a month or two and I like it. Like so many others I have tried heaps of systems and indicators. I have to say that I have come to the conclusion that no matter what indicator is used, to be successful it needs a bit of discretion from the trader and of course CAREFUL RISK/PROFIT MANAGEMENT. I havent got much to add to the thread at this stage, but I would like to encourage LOHAD to continue this thread (or another new one) as I think it has potential. I am looking forward to seeing the improvements you have made. Keep up the great work and a friendly, positive thread. I will continue to test and post some results/methods soon hopefully. Cheers, mattp

--- 帖子 #751 ---
great idea, chalk board... we all cruise the threads, nice to be able bring something we've found that is making a difference back to central.. some of the threads can get very abusive and negative.. so far so good here... friendly competition... same goal... different skills and talents.. you know people are seeing huge gains in fx, it can and is being done... found the trading history of the 1st place winner very interesting. He had millions of small losses, and only a few big winners, and turned $500 into $10,000 in a month. ($25000 grand prize) He knew what he was looking for. Like a surfer waiting for the big wave. Hi profit style. Then the second place winner ($5000 prize) had millions of small trades some winners and some losers no one trade either way went for more than around $300. Just more winners than losers. Hi probability style. In the end he turned $500 into $8800 in a month. How would I like to be able to do either of those trading styles like that every month!! back to drawing board....

--- 帖子 #752 ---
okay here is the chart for the 15m eur/usd anyway as the chart you can see it very clear that when super signal printed on chart Aroon should be end and stochastic corssover, WPR move to center when ever the trend is ended, DI+ and DI- of ADX is closing the gap, if WPR and movement of the price is not huge, and DI+ and DI- still show gap, the trend continue. (note I do not have good chart now, as I using marketiva platform for this) I will post it later. note: using longer time frame as your guide like 1h or 4h as what I find out is as long as those High Time Frame does not agree, most of time is not. also when WPR move to around 50 you can check if ADX DI+ and DI- is going to crossover, if in active session, it should crossover. Anyway check next high Time Frame as your guide. as I am tired on early Friday, miss the big trend will eur/usd is going down, as I knew as 1H show ADX going to crossover soon, and WPR is in around 50 area, Aroon show uptrend is ended 5 hours ago... maybe if I can stay up around 12am EST to 9am EST, I think I can beat the first guy who won the top prize.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
thank you tuppers, I've been meandering thru your stuff... trading is very individual, right down to what color the ma is... I played with aroon for a while and it will take a lot of getting used to for me, (sometimes it takes a while to make friends with an indicator). Stoch and I hit it off right away!!! I've altered the settings for stoch and after a few hours of testing I'm fired up... I've taken a little from here and a little from there and this is what I'm ready to try on demo in the live market... stoch settings, (100,9,3) ----changing that to (100,9,5) takes some of the bumpiness out... 3 averages (lwma 200, ema 200, 20 sma) that's it!!!!! the setting for stoch are incredible, they identify entries and keep you in the trade (with confidence) during the swings. I came up with a little trick for mm. open 2 positions with confirmation from signals. stop loss 5 pips for both 1st limit order 5 pips + spread no limit order for second. if the trade is no good, loss is 10 pips (what else is new?) if the first limit is reached but the trade is no good and reverses to stop out the gain balances out the loss. break even if the trade is good, 1st limit is 5 pips + spread gain and if it is indeed a break out.. stay put. leave 5 pip stop loss in place. (Think I've got that right to account for spread fee... Anyway that's the idea...) if stoch stays above 50 the trend is in intact trail a stop just below the 200 ema, the 200 lwma may get tagged along the way. As long as stoch is above 50 and price is above 200 ema stay in the trade. just keep trailing the stop to just beneath the 200 ema. that's for uptrend, vice versa for down trend. in general counter trend trades are not as strong, but they can be taken for small gains, more likely to get stopped out then trades in the direction of the ema 200... we shall see what we shall see. for exiting there are lots of alternatives. a recross of the 20 ma, a contrary signal from stoch, from what I have seen, as long as the stoch is above 50 the trend is still intact (for uptrend). I'll be working on this and the new twist on mm...

I apologize for the delay. I know that I said that I will show what I am working on over the weekend, but there has been some circumstances on the home front that I needed to attend to. So I will more then likely post what I am doing tomorrow (maybe afternoon CST). I will also post my simulator stats, quite impressive (although there is no substitute for a live feed and even live money even if it is the tiniest amounts. Guess what...... BBMacd is involved....... Go bag them pips! Lohad

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Thanks Lohad! anyway, here is the chart I am talking about. this is current eur/usd 30m chart ADX show seller still in contorl, and stochastic has showed buyer already ended. that mean downtrend is continue.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
sorry for second post, somehow as forum does not allowed me to edit attchment here is daily chart show better on ADX rules, notice on even when stochastic show sell, but ADX still show good gap, below ADXDMI is right ADX for meta4

--- 帖子 #758 ---
am following your posts. much appreciated. yes I see, dmi does not confirm sell when in strong uptrend even when stoch signals sell. good check and balance system...

--- 帖子 #759 ---
anyway, this system most of time is perfect. however, sometime do have some unexpected as, if current usd is strong or weak... like once, when everyting show end, eur/usd going down, but watch for usd how weak and strong it is. it will give you clue where the trend is heading. oh also like friday, eu have news come out good I think, everyone is buying. but usd is way stronger, ended up as eur/usd big sell. note: during eurpean session, make note on where the aud/usd and nzd/usd where is trend is heading, that is when usd is in control! so you know where eur/usd and gbp/usd is heading. unless the news keep the trend going other way. but harderly happend what I think is usd going to be strong next few weak, unless the news is very bad.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
the usd is the world reserve currency (at least for now), so commodities (nzd, aud) are closely correlated. dollar up, commodities down... same with the US stock market. mkt up, usd down... and vice versa... cad is tied to price of oil.. oil up cad up, oil down cad down... looks like a pullback in equities after the big run over last month or so, means oil down, so usd strong how reliable are the arrows that appear on the alerts?(the stoch indi?) the arrows on the super signal repaint? some of them seem to be totally out of touch with the price action.... also what time frame do you trade? thank you so much for your time and help.. jiva

--- 帖子 #761 ---
for TF, I using 1H or 4H as a guide. try to make note on the system I am meationed in this thread. super signal can only using as a guide, as inactive time is very good signal, but as very active time, is a crap excuse my typing. stochastic crossover is very good, but only pair with other indicator, rule for super signal and stochastic crossover is both have to be same direction. I am thinking if possible for programmer able to put super signal and stochastic crossover together would be another winner indicator at less 90% acurate. as try to avoid bad trade, you may want to using nxMACD, and Rads sMAC-D both are quite good to see where trend is heading. for you I think would be better enter only signal line, nxMACD, Rads' sMAC-D, and color stochastic. when it have same color that is signal (but make note on longer time frame)

--- 帖子 #762 ---
seems I can only assimilate little bit at a time.. the concept of using dmi with an oscillator is what i am working on. tried variations of stoch and macd and osma. But an old favorite has emerged, cci. there is a lot to you strategy, tuppers, and I can't jump and drive away, gonna take a little practicing to get the ideas behind it as well as the actual indis. for now use of the dmi has come out shining looks like 3 is magic number. get 3 indis (calculated from different perspectives) to confirm and probability is greatly increased for successful trade. I hanker for simplicity. I'll be testing 2 indis together along with the 20 sma. that's the idea... (the chart is noted incorrectly, the cci signal is for above or below 0, not 50)

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hey guys, FYI, I posted what I have been coming up with on the EUR/GPB Trendmagic thread since it uses some of their indicators. I still need to post my PDF file on how I use it, but at least you will see what I am using. I will post the rest of the information as well. I may post all of this info here as well. Lohad

okay. here are some links I have been running through... http://www.fxstreet.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=4 http://codebase.mql4.com/experts Have been testing an ea I found at the mql4 site. The strategy behind this ea is very simple and the ea itself has back tested very positive..... see graph for results for 2 days 5 mins. eurusd. and a graph of rsult for same 2 days run for 15mins even without the ea just the strategy itself run manually looks good... this is the link to author's post with the downloads.. http://codebase.mql4.com/5407 this is what a chart template for the ea looks like: stategy is to buy with a break above jaw and hk blue sell with break below jaw hk red close with high percent gain or break below (above) hk

Ok, I got caught in the Edge/TG fiasco when I abandoned my technique of scalping. Even though I found days where the above mentioned system was good, I had a lot more of the bad days. I should have never strayed. Actually I should have never kept on tweaking my original thought process within this thread. Well actually, I feel the transformation of my original system was good and needed. My original trading system was way too busy. So I have ventured out to try to simplify it yet keep the results. Well I have stripped this system down as much as I feel I can (except considering getting rid of the Max_Non Lag MA) and at the same time achieve acceptable results. So I will throw this out there, in case any one still follows this thread in stealth mode. Trade it if you like. Modify it to suit your needs. Flame it if you feel compelled to. Ask questions if you are interested. Still the same here. Make it your playground. I for one will try to hold off modifying this anymore, unless one of my fellow traders comes up with something better .

Let's do it! Gonna take it to the big boys! Bag them pips traders!!!!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi LOHAD, You've got what it takes. Never give up. Only way to lose is to quit.....You'll be one of the ones to make it. Your attitude is what makes it... Inspired me way back. I've been all over everywhere too. Picked up a lot of trading ideas, sorted through them and suspect this is a process will be on going even after I am settled into a strategy. I've managed to collect umpteen zillions of indicators. One thing I've notices is that no matter what strategy or set of indicators I use, pivots and support and resistances are essential for me to keep tabs on. A big one is the 200ema for me. pa will gravitate to it, hang on it, dance around it, bounce on itd, break through it for big moves, etc... And daily pivot points along with their associated supports and resistances. Maybe it is only because big players use these values to place big limits and stops. Anyway these pivots and r1's and s1's are key to pa. Best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hey Jiva, Thanks for the kind words. Yes it has been quite the journey. Some definite wrong turns, thank God none that cost me too much. I believe there are many good systems out there, you just need to find a strategy that suits you. Me, being a M1 trader, this system suits me for this type of trading. I have tried and tested many other strategies out there and they never yielded the returns that I have seen with this system, so a few weeks back, I decided to pick this system back up since it was the one that generated the most pips for me. So I am looking forward to sticking with this plan, and focusing on the BBMacd. I noticed you have started a thread with your personal strategy. I will stop by and take a look. If there is anything I can offer (with out derailing your system) I will be more then happy to input my observations. I must say from the surface it looks like you put together a nice system. I look forward to reading up on it. Regards, Lohad

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Hi Lohad, I have been following this thread and there's a couple of nice systems in it... How do you use the MA's in your last system? Also, the dashed line you left from the Soeasy Bands is just a Simple Moving Average - SMA(25). Is there any other use for this indicator in your system? Regards, Ronaldo

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Hey Ronaldo, I mainly look for the three MA's to cross (or weave if that is the correct term). The faster MA in color first gives warning, then the slower MA with the complete cross of the Max_NonLagMA completes the cross. Also I have found the "tighter" the MA's are together when they cross, the better chance of a stronger move. I also use the Max-NonLag as my "cutter" when I see the Max_NonLag breaking the "weave" I will start looking for an exit. I use the SoEasy BBands because sometimes I like to turn the outer bands back on to see the extent of any consolidation or also looking for evidence of a breakout from consolidation. I also use the BBands as a trend tool. Below the center BBand line, I look only for shorts, unless I am in a CT sort of way. Above the center BB line, I am looking for longs. Thanks for checking out the system. Please do not hesitate to ask any more questions you may have. Lohad

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Jiva, Here is a shot of the trade I just completed. This is a preview of what I use for ranging markets and also on Fridays. If you look at my entry, you will see the previous swing high. That was my stop. It almost got hit, but I held. Also, you will notice this was a tad early by my system standards. I did not wait for FXPrime JE to signal short (I am still refining my range system). So I made 3 trades today = 3 wins = 15 pips. This is half my daily goal M-Th. If I get 15 on Friday, I am done. Yee - Haw the weekends here.... I will be around though if you have any questions. If people are interested in my range version let me know, I can post and explain. But I am still "field testing" it.. Regards, Lohad

--- 帖子 #772 ---
a problem with the 1m is that it moves so fast it's counterproductive to try to document the trade while it is going on... even to get a snapshot is sometimes out of the question... so thank you for the efforts. I see what you're saying here. good going...

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I hear ya Jiva. You cannot thinking about taking pictures when you are in the M1 gauntlet. That is why when I post a picture after my trade, I drag my trade into the chart so people can see my entry and exit. Also it shows me the conditions of my entry and exit. Now this last one I traded (picture posted above), the short continued big time. However it was Friday. I hit my Friday goal and it was time for me to call it a week. There was no indication for me to get out other then my Friday goal to be hit and locked in the profits. Just remember when trading M1 you need to be very keen on PA. I watch PA then I look to see if my indicators agree. If they do you, you need to pull the trigger as soon as possible. My goal of 5-7 pips can be missed my sitting on a entry for a minute too long. I say this yet I am very interested in trying your new idea on your thread, with no PA on the chart at all. Best regards, Lohad

yes, but I thought I made the adjustments listed in a previous post. what else could it be? maybe I didn't make the proper adjustments. thanks

Ronaldocpont no email address. Maybe they will drop by for a visit.... will run a search of the forums maybe they haunt another thread regularly. Have you been able to load the indi? Any opinion? thanks jiva34 (forum search turned up nothing except the posts here.)

Hi Lohad, Great scalping system. I like the BBMACD, too. Well, my post purpose to show you a modified BBMACD, by the curtesy of Adolah2000 , who is the writer under Mt4. The essence of the modification , that it is mixed the traditional MACD and the BB MACD, so some BBMACD pattern easier to identify. It shows a dotted line in the middle of Bollinger Band, which is the signal line of the traditional MACD, and so the BBMACD have 3 S/R now. The first is the UPPER band, tehn comes the white dotted line, then LOWER band. Much easier can be identified the so called Super divergence, which is a very strong signal after the pullback. Beside this, the traditional lines can be set to different sensitivity (for example Fast 5, Slow 35, so must be a very sensitiv signals. I have attached a picture, and the code of the modified BBMACD. Use them free.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Thanks for sharing. I will give it try and report on what I see. Lohad
