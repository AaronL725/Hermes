WinningSolution System-EA What is it? It's an EA/Dashboard comfort with most pairs, included Gold, Oil, Silver,... I coded it to work 24/24, with ranging/trending market, included any news... BUT as all other system, keep it away from any sudden death news with influential extremely broad and serious like war, earthquake,... How about it's result? I posted here .ex4 file, take a backtest/fowardtest and find the answer yourself... Part 1 - single pair - done: I have uploaded latest version here, 13d. You can try, take backtest/foward test, please don't forget to post your report/setting here, and please keep it update . NOTE : -Run the EA with account balance 10.000 for lots 0.01. Try to modify GridSize and BreakOutStage to find out the different. -EA comfort with both scalping and daytrading, just config the setting and attach EA to M1,M5 or M15 chart (For backtest, I suggest to use M5 chart). USDCAD_13c Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD_13c Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDUSD_13c Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPAUD_13c Attached Image (click to enlarge) EURUSD_13c Attached Image (click to enlarge) Part 2 - Dashboard version: Final version will be posted here, after we found the best setting that comfort with all/allmost pair, for at least 1 year (To make sure it can work with all time of market). It's a Dashboard version, with strategy like the EA for single pair, but INCLUDE many functions: SL/TP, basker SL/TP in pips/money, read news, one-click to open/close trades,... And the most important, it can give us sync-signal feature that I am sure will improve the signal much more. On another hand, Dashboard will give you a big/clear picture, help you have a better overview of the market. Dashboad version will look like the picture I uploaded here. Many thanks to Hotpotato, GVC and other at Dashboard Trading gave me a sign to build Dashboard versions. And many thanks to EddyXiao, the friend was always with me... Attached Image (click to enlarge) -------------------------- Jun-06-2016 : Due to limit number attach files from FF, I can not post more backtest result here. A draft version, for backtest, to check the logic of EA will be released today when I back to home. I will post 2 versions, with a little different. Please run backtest/fowardtest and post the result here, to find out which one is better. Jul-02-2016 : All backtest report removed to keep room for other uploads. Posted latest single pair version 13d. Jun-03-2016: WinningSolutionV13f.ex4 uploaded, added hour filter. Jun-04-2016: WinningSolution version 13h uploaded. Added MaxSpread filter, MaxSpread=0 mean disable.

Backtest for long time give you a clear picture how your EA doing. Event with 99% quality, can not guaranteed EA will do exactly with live trading. And I want say again, I do not talk about the result, how much growing, etc.. I show you here WHAT MY EA DOING (For long time, from 2015, trading 24/24 through many news, many events, many holidays,...)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Now, I running backtest for all 28 pairs and update here, maybe take about 1 week. Each pair need about 3 hours to complete backtest from 2015.01.01 If EA show me good result, I will complete it and give you a try here (Ofcouse if you interesting in ).

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hello, good idea, i need to test this EA also, maybee can help.. send me the EA .. regards

Brillant. Your work is appreciated.

Thanks for your interesting. EA still in development. I will release it here ASAP when done, maybe within this week.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You are welcome

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Personally I Always backtest as of 2010, just after the market crash. And if I am wild, I also test 2000 - 2008, and 2008 - 2010 seperately. This I do to avoid curve-fitting as much as possible. In my opinion, a system always works best in certain conditions. Knowing generally when the conditions are positive helps to improve the results. Being able to study the profitable and the non-profitable conditions therefore helps a lot. If I can help in anyway with testing, just let me know. It is time consuming, and for this purpose I do have a low-wattage box that I can keep running for multiple days.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Interesting Will follow. Vlad

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I agree, "a system always works best in certain conditions". That's why we see many traders say take care when any big news release. Event that, with some sudden death news like war, earthquake,... in the past, no one can foresee. Here, I show you here backtest results from 2015, without any sudden death news, because I have no time . You can see account growing up (That's the sign keep me continue to code this EA) with the maximum DD, different with each pairs, that's the most important! I want to find out the maximum DD may be happen when I go live. I found that at a certain moment (In about 1 or 2 weeks), there is no more than 2 pairs go to max DD. My purpose is run EA with 28 pairs, and there is no more than 2 pairs go to max DD at a certain moment =&gt; max DD not higher 5k (examply only, in backtest result), account growing around 200$/pair/month =&gt; 200$ x 28pairs = 5600$ per month. This is acceptable risk/reward result. One more think.. In the end, I will complete EA to Dashboard version (There are many Dashboard public here, you can take an example from GVC, Hotpotato, braintheboss,...) , with much more improve signal quality and functions. And I will give you and everybody a try, public here ASAP when it be done. I used Core i7-4710HQ with 24Gb ram to backtest EA, it take about 3 hours for each pairs... If you have better computer (xeon, server, etc...) with better performance, I need your help, please let me know. Good luck to everybody!

I don't understand how the system works... is there an explanation?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
where is the robot ea? for test

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I am waiting ur EA here buddy

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I dont think a better pc could do something more because mt4 is 32bit and 1 core rendering (I might be wrong on this one) you could try to test on multiple clients , so you backtest more pairs at the same time. as for the balance equity , reminds me the zone ea backtest results NOTE THIS IS NOT THE SYSTEM OF THIS EA

--- 帖子 #25 ---
"reminds me the zone ea backtest results" Yes, I also figured it is some kind of grid, but I am wondering how the DD remains so low (according to the screens) Grid normally means there are periods of high DD, possible to break the biggest of accounts. Therefore I would love to see testing over prolonged periods. If we can devide the load, it would be quicker. Also, optimisation for different pairs could be distributed, as this can also take pretty long.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
seems interesting, I'll follow

AUDNZD Updated on post 1

--- 帖子 #28 ---
looks good.lets wait for your EA

--- 帖子 #29 ---
you are probably using a variable lot size. Can you test it with fixed lot size?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Can't wait for this EA

--- 帖子 #31 ---
It looks similar to Remon's threat. Are you using a similar strategy? Would it be an idea to combine efforts ?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Ok, got it, is not the wide-spread J.Nemeth Recovery Zone refined martingale system. But what is it? I mean what is the operating principle ? ...can you share the operating principle before I download and try that stuff, please?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I am on business for several days, will be back and update the backrest result ASAP. This is a long story! Trust me, I have usesd/tested many EA, many strategy included recovery zone or from Remon. BUT, as you know, no one can keep you alive with market. FX cost me many things, many time, many opportunities, and money, and happiness. This EA is the result after all the failures that. I will public the EA here and give you a try soon. Sent from my phone.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
colleagues by passion, but do you all beginners? It's an old system and there is the old free ea, this

--- 帖子 #35 ---
the robot MyPiramid, what is the set?, thank you

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Above mentioned "MyPiramid_V08c" EA's backtest results - with default settings - from 2012 with $10k deposit are shown below. Max. Absolut DD was $6378, so REAL max. Relative DD would be -63.78%, assuming that the backtest had been started just before the time of max. DD or if lot size had been adjusted to actual balance. Not bad for a Martingale with average 82% yearly ROI and no crash for the past 4.5 years... Of course, in a backtest... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi MasterGuru agree with you on the fact that 4.5 years with a martingale EA without burning the account is a record. I have more or less the same results but on H1. Someone has mql file of My Pyramid?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I have Googled it and found a modified MQL4 version of MyPiramid_V08c EA here: https://www.mql5.com/en/job/34942 According to the related info only the following option was added: "invert trades" = True/False, although I could not find it among the parameters.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi MasterGuru, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks a lot for sharing, Master Guru. This is a quite good one, it can survive in BT without avoiding NFP/bid rate. Let try build a better version together!

When and how are we getting this ea please

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I will publish the beta version soon. Still have some ideas to code...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This is the most promising EA i have ever seen in 5 years. The idea is great! I did some small modifications and it works well in both trending &amp; ranging market. The profit and DD both went down after the change, but it only triggered lvl3 trade.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Very interesting EA; when is it possible to test? thanks

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi and hou can we get these EA for our selfs?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
@jonirrenicus Which EA have you tested?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
The EA you gave us...not ducdavon's. But I checked his back test data files, his EA is similar to pyramid with a different approach in lots increasement. Short word, 100% win in trending market, have trouble in tight ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks! It might be interesting to test it on more trending/volatile pairs, e.g. on the Dragon (GJ).

--- 帖子 #55 ---
In real trade, stop orders will not be dealt at the setting price on days of NFB/Bidrate. in back test big NEWS will save your ass when get stuck in several ranging days, in real trade it will kill your ACC.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
forward testing will yield greater progress ..you need ECN razor .. test it 0.01 lots ... I think live broker spread will be too much to handle but never give up!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I have an idea to make such EA more effective against ranging markets! But will reduced total profit as a side effect

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Reduced profit is much better then a margin call.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Congrat... We are right here waiting for you!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
No no no. we are waiting for your release, my idea is only the small part of a great thing. It is quite simple, before your EA switch to loss recovery mode it only trade counter-trend signals. EX. RSI &gt;70 = sell RSI &lt;30 = buy it will reduce your profit in strong trending conditions but will greatly reduce the DD in ranging markets meanwhile.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi, where can I find this EA for testing?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
RSI is one I used as a trigger to open/close trades. I will release the latest version within today. The most important for the draft version is: 1/ Test the logic/strategy of EA. Does the EA working well (for all pairs)? 2/ Find out the best setting that comfort for all (or at least all most) pairs. Draft version finished, I running the last backtest with EURUSD and GBPAUD and insert some lines of code at input section of EA.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
[Quote = jonirrenicus; 9007393] {quote} Esta es la EA más prometedora que he visto en 5 años. La idea es genial! Hice algunas pequeñas modificaciones y funciona bien tanto en el mercado de tendencias y van. El beneficio y DD ambos bajaron después del cambio, pero sólo activan el comercio lvl3. {Image} [/ quote] Hi Jonirrenicus, Can you share the file to backtest. Thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
EURUSD backtest from latest version 13c

--- 帖子 #65 ---
You have got the answer already my friend, the best pair is EUR/USD obviously. I have tried correlative trading in last few month and i lost my ACC. I dont want anyone follow my step, trading pairs with the best performance only is what i learned from it. If I trade E/U only, i will gain 200% instead of -100%. My humble opinion: Correlative trading will not divide your risk but expose your weakness, especially for martingale systems. EX. trade 28 pairs, 27 pairs won 10% each, 1 pair lost. You lost 100%. In this game, your have 28 opponents with different skills, you can't and dont need to beat them all, just pick up 1-3 of them which is easy for you then beat them 1000+ times, you won the game.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
"trade 28 pairs, 27 pairs won 10% each, 1 pair lost. You lost 100%." My goal, there is not any lost pair, event that won only 1-2% each pairs. In specify time, one/any pair goes to DD but the others still in profit, mean that your account still growing event any pair have high DD. I don't think trade with only best pair like EURUSD as you said is a good choice. If it's true, I think we have o reason to stay here .

--- 帖子 #67 ---
GBPAUD v13c I will public EA here next few hours...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
EA uploaded on post 1, with some new information. Have a nice weekend!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
This EA and mine posted here are different.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Fully agree. My PC is good but I can run only 2 backtest at the same time, because my CPU come too hot when I tried to run more than 3... @Everyone: A tip for you if you want to run more than 1 backtest at the same time: https://www.mt4copier.com/improve-mt...e-copier-speed

NOTE : -Run the EA with account balance 10.000 for lots 0.01. Try to modify GridSize and BreakOutStage to find out the different. -EA comfort with both scalping and daytrading, just config the setting and attach EA to M1,M5 or M15 chart (For backtest, I suggest to use M5 chart). Updated on post 1.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Can you share a template. It doesnt work in backtesting. It gives message- EXPERT REMOVE FUNCTION CALLED

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You just need the EA. @All: Version 13d posted on post 1. If you get error "EXPERT REMOVE FUNCTION CALLED", try with new version 13d. There is not any changes between 13c and 13d version. Let me know if you have any troubles.

Thank you for spontaneous reply. I am testing and I will attach set file too

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi, thanks for the ea. What would be your minimum (safe account size) and max currency pair suggestion to go live with the ea?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Thx, I tried running the optimizer to find the best settings. However, i cannot select to run the optimisation parameters, they are greyed out. Can you fix this? thx

--- 帖子 #79 ---
To go live, I suggest minimum balance 10.000USD to trade with starting lots 0.01 My goal: trade 28 pairs or more, with profit around 300-500/pair/month =&gt; account can growing around 100%/month. I need 10.000USD balance, to keep away from margin call, or account fire up with sudden death news. Anyway, don't use this EA for live! It's better to test this EA to know how it perform and post your setting here first, when final version (Dashboard version) release, you can go live if you want.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You mean 10k for one pair? or 10k is good for 5-10 pairs?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
My friend, I do not like to increase lots size at this time. Profit value is not the goal at this time. Most important here is the ratio profit/maxDD, and try to keep the maxDD below 10.000 (10.000USD is the amount I can affort, and I think you can too, or you can go live with micro account). Now, I just need to find out the best setting that comfort with all pairs, mean that if I go live, there is not any pair can blow up my account. When we have best setting, I will build Dashboard version, that's my target.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
10k to trade 28 pairs, or more. Why 10K? - That's maximum amount I can deposit to brokers, and it's big enough to keep every pairs away from margin call or fire up . When you have the answer for question above, and you go live, you will ask God, dont have much drawdown perform in the same time. Anyway, from the backtest, I saw that there is no more than 2 maxDD perform in same week. Hope that you can understand what I want to say. My English is not very good...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
good stuff.... can i say this is a martingale EA...and the only way for it to be safe is to trade with $10k capital and start griding from 0.01 lots on h1 chart?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
You can. But will you deposit 10K to take 500 per month? - I don't. I want more... That's why I build this system.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I think you misunderstand. I am not interested in lotsize. I want to run optimizer over all settings, so that we can find the best settings vs drawdown. The optimizer will produce a list with all settings and the max DD, so that you are free to choose what settings suit you. Now I need to run every step in risk, take profit, stop loss, gridsize and breakoutstage seperately. This is tedious. With optimizer you can just switch on your comp for a few days and it will produce all valid results. Then people can check what settings are "best" for their taste. If you deposit 10k, and want less DD than 10K to be save, you are mistaken. You need less than 10k as margin requirement. "DD &lt; initial deposit" does not guarantee you do not get a margin call. The margin requirements will be different for each broker, and can change over time.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
50% net profit is nothing to sneeze at ... when risk is limited, I will happily take that on any investment.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I've never use optimizer function before . Version 13e uploaded here, as your request, with just some modify to run optimizer. Thanks for great support. BTW, my target is find the best setting on another section, not lots size, my friend. Let me know if you have any troubles. Waiting from you.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Its possible put time for trade? For example: Open: 00:00 Close: 07:00

--- 帖子 #89 ---
It's possible, in next version. I will public it here tomorrow.

USDCAD v13c BreakOutStage=2 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks for sharing this great EA! Logic tested....this is a trend trading EA, my RSI idea will not work on it. What is BreakOutStage used for? Here is a way to avoid ranging markets: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Quit 1-2 days before NFP, or exit at the monthly pivot. To achieve this, Could you pls. add a function for exit at a certain price (or at certain time)? with 2 option menu: 1 close all when price reached(or reach end time) 2 close at break even

--- 帖子 #92 ---
"What is BreakOutStage used for?" BreakOutStage can be called as dynamic SUP/RES, calculated by EA. Set BreakOutStage lower, EA will exit the ranging market more often. In most of time, lower value reduce your profit but keep you alive with market. "Could you pls. add a function for exit at a certain price (or at certain time)" The current versions is for backtest/foward test with very limit functions, to check the logic of EA and give us the answer: Does EA's strategy can work with all pairs? The functions you talk about, ofcouse, will be have at Dashboard version. You will have a setting to keep EA away from any news as you want. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #93 ---
understood. It can work on most pairs and you have proved it already. in live trading there are only 16 pairs can be played with, the rest have incredible high spread,see pic: Attached Image Even if you passed tests on all pairs with limited DD, you will never touch some of them in real trading. So....I suggest finding the best one to trade in 16 playable pairs which is trending at the moment, as our next goal.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
My friend, The pic you show above is the average spread calculated on every tick or the highest spread?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
GBPAUD 13c new backtest with BreakOutStage=2 Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDCHF 13c I run backtest from Jan-16-2015 due to really big candle on Jan-15-2015. EA still pass it, but will make a huge spike in the report. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #96 ---
weekend spreads any way, GBP/AUD has an average spread around 5, no one will touch it cause GBP/JPY has only 4 and wider movement. After i adjusted grid size to 4, results in G/U become much better! Could you explain how it's working my friend?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Oh... Please remove weekend spreads from stats . I am sure when you go live you will shut down EA in couple hours before market close lol Bigger GridSize, distance between 2 orders will be bigger. It calculate based on Average Daily Range in latest 30 days. Go backtest and find out the best setting...

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi,Ducdaovn, I backtest your e-version on EURUSD from 2016.01.01 with 10000USD, account just blowed up on 2016.02.03, I use the default settings: GridSize 2, EmergenceTrade true, BreakOutStage 4, And 5min TF, I'm not sure whether it's my fault that I backtest your EA in a wrong way? Sorry, I'm not a native English speaker, hope you understand what I mean.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Ducdaovn I try to back test your EA and have order send error message in Journal can you give me a solution for it? thanks Alex

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I and many people here have not got this error... I think this error due to EA send order with lot 0.01, tradeable with mini account but yours is bigger . Open a new mini demo account, try again and let me know!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Running optimizer on WinningSolutionV13e.ex4 for eur/usd. Will be done in an estimated 10 days....

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Look interesting. I will test it with smaller account size see if it works

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Latest version 13f posted on post 1. Hour filter added. I have not tested it yet, let me know if it have any troubles.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
1 To shut down EA before NEWS must on one condition that is you are profitable, sometimes market do not cooperate, we have to trade right at the time of the release. If it's NFP or Bid rate, we have big trouble. That' why i suggest stop EA 1-2 days before head. 2 There are 2 famous formula for calculating the range, one is ADR(30days), another is ATR(50days). Have you tied the another one before?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Tested, it's good. Could pls. add a vertical line in next version as following pic if possible?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I concur with xuantianfeng. Default settings blow up the account on Eur Usd before 3 Feb due to extended ranging period in Jan 16. However the acct survives with Break out Stage 1 and gridsize2. Ducdaovn, I went thru your backtest parameters on EurUsd and is different from the EA you posted. Your backtest parameters had "MinPointToOpenNewOrder=400; PointExpectToRescueLoss=200;". Please could you also explain further how the grid size is measured. For instance what do you mean by gridsize 2 Thanks

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I found Break out Stage 4 and gridsize 3 is a compromising setting for all pairs. EUR Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
"MinPointToOpenNewOrder=400; PointExpectToRescueLoss=200;" This setting is from old version. Latest version I already posted here, with backtest result too. GridSize is min distance between 2 orders, calculate based on AverageDailyRange. GridSize=2 mean that MinPointToOpenNewOrder=0.2ADR

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thanks for the info. Will look at your settings.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Okay I understand. Thanks

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It's a amazing EA with low DD and stable profit. Many thanks for your sharing! BTW: I think it's better to add the custom order comment setting so that we can find out the orders opened by the EA from a long orders list.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Thank you for your setting, I'll try it.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
strange in the back test does not allow you to change settings

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thank you for the input bro, Can you please share your set file or files or your recent test image as to assist the coder and the members too so that critics will atleast know before any hasty comment. Many of us have here seen DD fluctuating so difference of opinion does occur. Your information will resolve the differences

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I'm using the default settings and get the similar backtest result with Ducdaovn's result.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi jonirrenicus, could you please share us what part did you modified in MyPyramid EA? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
MyPyramid EA is a good one but it is a rubbish comparing to winning solution EA. The problem is the profitability is too low. Maybe Ducd can help to increase it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) modifications: 1 Add manual in/exit trigger 2 Add stop at price(or time) function 3 only use counter trade signals to avoid consolidations 4 ATR grid size 5 ON H1 Chart only Remember this EA should not be discussed further here, unless Ducd says yes.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
OK, I got it. I'm sure the WinningSolution EA is much better as well and looking forward to the final version very much.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
EA and backtest I posted here always use default setting, if have any change I also give a note. So that, you can easy have the same backtest as me. I want to have backtest from all pairs, to check the logic of EA, can comfort with all pairs, or stay away from any pairs. So that, please take a backtest from the one I have not backetst it yet.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Can you please give me a try to access to source code, maybe I can do somethings.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
OK, I will try to help. But I'm so curious that why the backtest speed of Winning Solution EA is so slowly... I have just finished the EU backtest for about 2 hours...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
as you wish... TMA H/L line is the trigger, that why it is good at consolidation, but shit at trend trading.

Please try to modify setting and help the EA climb through... That's exactly what I want.

WinningSolution version 13h uploaded on post 1. Added MaxSpread filter, MaxSpread=0 mean disable.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I'm tired of doing tests and get the same results, it reaches a point that breaks the account.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Ducdaovn, i'm testing your EA on different broker (demo account), but i have the same problem: open the order and in a few milliseconds it is closed. See attached image. According to what could be the problem? Thanks for your help. In BT works perfectly.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
PM me your skypeID, I will contact you when I am free.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Ofcouse, this is a boring and tedious work, find a best setting can comfort with every pairs, or everything, if you want call it like that. Forgot to tell you and everybody, don't need to set spread too high when backtest. Why? In final version, Spread filter will be added. Example, with EURUSD, average spread (Post by Pepperstone brokers https://pepperstone.com/vn/forex-trading/spreads ) is 2 points. You can set Spread=4 in backtest. Set Spread too high will do a lot of misleading results from reality.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Ducdaovn, i have no problem to give you my Skype ID, but i think that we are in the public forum and if you give to the forum the possible solution on my problem we wil help the community. What do you think? Regards

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well, Sorry if I disturb you, but as you see at the Title of thread. This is a small square for WinningSolution System/EA. It's better for you, and for WinningSolution System/EA, if you keep this thread for it only. Try to open new thread for your own. I am very interesting to subscribed to. Best regards.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Yes of course, I understand. However we are in a good way. And all our team in effort will lead to an optimal result.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hehe Just because I am too, don't know why EA doesn't work with your PC. So I want connect to your PC through Teamviewer to find out why.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I understand. In meantime: have you any idea on my problem? Regards

--- 帖子 #140 ---
&lt;hipster mode&gt; I'm tired of doing tests too ! Ever since post one we have been in expectance of the magic make-endless-amounts-of-money button. It is time we get the EA and the appropriate settings right now ! Or else we will be disappointed and seek another thread that promises endless effortless returns with no risk. &lt;/hipster mode&gt; After a day of running tests over a 6-year period on EU/USD, 23 passes have been made and none were succesfull. This will take way too long (still 1500 hours). I will run again and now solely optimize the gridsize. Will post the progress later

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Sure bro,Deleted the reply.No worries

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Ducdaovn, congratulations for your EA it looks great. I'm testing it on demo with many pairs and if you allow me I will post the myfxbook link here. Regards

--- 帖子 #143 ---
hi with 1000 deposit and lot=0.01 it falls by the way would u please place mq4 code of Ea for users to determine the strategy

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I know there is one great EA that you have already got in your folder, the one with no martingale tricks and can past all tests on all major pairs.... if you can find the source code for me, i tell you how to use it.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
dont worry, ducd is trying to fix my EA by using his wisdom. My pyramid EA will not blow up any ACC. on all major pairs and GOLD, just try out.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I have some trouble. My children get sick and I have to stay with her in hospital. Will be back with you ASAP when I am free.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hope your children will be fine soon. I have found a method can past all tests on major pairs with NO martingale tricks. I will let you know when you come back. result on the cable : DD is quite low but the profitability sucks.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hope to see your children well soon.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks, we've just be back to home. Now I have to take a rest first, too tired when not sleep for two days. @All: If you have test my EA, you can see that EA not use martingale strategy, event if you want, maybe called as modified martingale only. @ jonirrenicus : I am very happy to listen to you!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi jack, Can you do me a favor, have you ever found manger EAs which has function to stop auto-trading at set price with a set profit? EX. stop at 1.1500 with $10 profit. This one is good but does not have "close at price" function.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
glad to see you come back~ martingale means increase lot size against the current trend, apparently, your EA is not that type. my mistake. sleep well

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I'm sorry I don't have an EA like your description. Maybe you can make it yourself because I found you are good at programming in MQL language after I read your modified Pyramid EA.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I agree that your WinningSolution EA is absolutely not martingale EA. But what confused me is that how the lot size calculated in your EA? For example, when I did backtest of WinningSolutionV13h in GBPJPY and I found the following lot size with increasing dramatically and made my account stopped out. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Every trade open based on it's chance/opportunity. Lots increase when total trade in loss, and EA think there is a chance/opportunity to recover and goes to profit. As always, nothing is 100%, sometimes EA failed and blow up account. Your backtest is exactly what I want. I will try to fix/limit the mistake you posted above.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I got it. Looking forward your new version EA. But, first of all, have a good sleep.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I'm shit at both programming and trading, that's why i'm here

--- 帖子 #158 ---
the same as you shaking hands.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
The results of my optimisation run in the attached file, EUR/USD with 10k initial deposit. Over a 6 year period optimizing.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
The winning solution need a solution for ranging markets, here is my thoughts: The ADX is famous for smelling the ranging. 1 obvious trend break a several days box , we call it trend 2 During the trend the ADX must break previously ADX high, so that we confirm it is a trend 3 Once we confirmed a trend, if the ADX go down to 25, END EA in profit or small loss 4 ADX start to dig around 25, if we see there are 2 V shapes(not happen in one day), we confirm the consolidation is over ( or near end) and start EA again I manually tested on GBP, it saved this EA from meeting heaviest DD several times... pls. try and feed back are most welcomed!

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi everyone . Ducdaovn awesome EA and approach, congrats. I am using the default settings and I am able to see the EA run in the strat testing but when I run it on a demo account no trades are taken. I am trying this with a $1000 balance with a 0.01 lotsize. There are no errors in the logs. I double checked all EA settings in both the options and properties. However the EA will run in the start tester using a $500 balance. My broker is Tallinex so the currency has a suffix, but that can't be the problem cause then it would not run in the strat tester. If any one has any insight, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you JEss

--- 帖子 #162 ---
My friend, As I said before, the current EA I coded to test the strategy. I also have never go live with it, even just with Demo account. It's not my target at this stage. Anyway, full version (Looks like the pic in post 1) will be released here soon. I am on my way to code it, maybe need some days.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Oh, I apologize. I miss interpreted. I thought we were allowed to forward test it on Demo accounts. No problem. I plan to attack it a little different. My objective is to take advantage of the moments that the EA is winning and just get enough to generate 1-2% on daily basis. Control the on and off times of the EA etc etc. The key is to detect when and if the EA starts to take a dive and immediately stop it. Then after a time reactivate it and continue collecting as the EA does it's thing. Simple and easy.. Thank you sir... take care Jess

--- 帖子 #164 ---
LOL @ SIMPLE AND EASY ... history always repeats itself in trading it seems.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
MT4 does not have such testing ability and never will due to lack of resources, hence it must be fixed and no commissions ability for testing unless it is coded in the EA.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
tradability: I tell you it repeats but very few (5%) take advantage of it. It's all there in front of us to use it and be profitable. This is a game and once you get the hang of a game.. well you know... LOL

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Yes to the 98% of traders it's a game to the 2% successful traders its a business.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Right, but if u treat it as a game the solution comes alot sooner and easier. Once u have that, THEN you treat it as a business (money management, taxes, etc). Anyhow unfortunately Mr SnapShow will not provide the EA and least of all the approach. I can still work with the signals, but the risk is that if he gets hit by a beer truck and or disappears, it's over. So I wish him the best of luck.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
That's because he thinks he will become a millionaire from it using a martingale and obviously his mathematical ability illudes him. He has not done studies on martingales. But he will enjoy the game until it wipes him out and the next stupid person comes along and tries it again. So good luck to him. One must stay positive and not lose focus even when they are on a loser lol

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Basing an strategy on a martingale is always a loosing game. By maths, a martingale will always fail, no doubt.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Orderprofit has already calculated with Spread and Commission in source code. Attached Image If you think I work hard to code an EA and give you as free away gift, you can take away from my thread. I try hard to find a way, to keep and enjoin my life, and maybe I will continue give everyone a try, BUT if you want source code... I have no interesting in martingale. There is not any strategy can win in all cases, as I know. But I am on my way to find out one, as many people. My EA mixed many strategy. I do not care what you think, what you call, what you named it. Let result give you an answer. Anyway, thanks for the good wishes.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
You seem to read but lack the ability to understand..I already said it has to be coded in the EA, then you come on and show that this is true idiota lol. I don't need your confirmation I been around and seen it all or just about. Secondly I already said let results speak for themselves but in a long term not short term. Short term results are meaningless, and useless and most blow accounts in a short term. Only the 2% of successful traders survive beyond the 156 weeks time frame. So I don't care if you care or not and your journey has no meaning to anyone but yourself. BUT if I got a dollar for every idiot that comes online and says they have the holy grail I would be a billionaire in a month or under.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
No my friend, you misunderstood, I just mentioned that with your EA or even your signals I can do things, no need for the source. The risk with the signals is if you go away or disappear then we are left with nothing. Now if you offered the source that would be kewl too . LOL. But it is ok, you are doing what you consider to be the right thing for yourself. PEACE

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Well said! There is a long way for most of us to become the 2%, maybe it's a dead end and all struggles are in vain~ He's EA a promising one just give it a try, my friend

--- 帖子 #175 ---
My issue is I have seen his kind of EA come and go and not one has withstood the market in a lengthy period. But you and the many that believe in it can and good luck to you all trying it and wasting your money on it. I'd rather not waste anymore of my time on martingales just from studies over the decades! P.S Just a bit of advice if you happen to get in front protect your initial capital this way you won't regret going down that path lol

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Well said, @Tradability ! The following ForexFactory thread gives a textbook example of what you have referred to: Martingaling - Looks so good until the inevitable As the author of the above thread states: "the initial deposit was $1000, and it grew to a profit at its peak of close to $125,000 &lt;----- Thats right, $125K which is quite a decent return. Today that balance is down approx $55K in realised losses and almost $20K in unrealized draw down. What took 3 plus years to build has taken a combination of about 3 weeks and 20-30 something trades of losing trade , no SL, double up, further losing trades, still no SL, double up and on and on it went. This is a Martingale at its finest." I should also mention @Hanover's excellent comment about it in another thread titled Did Martingale work for someone? : " I'm sure you're aware of the way Martingale operates: it guarantees recovery until one unexpectedly long losing sequence suddenly causes ruin." "Given that such a losing sequence (for example, 10 consecutive losses) is a very rare event in the example, it took more than 5,000 trades before it happened. Using historical data to try to determine how likely it will occur sooner, rather than later, is close to futile, due to the high statistical error." "Given that price movement is close to random (50/50), if a trader trades for long enough then, at least theoretically, he will eventually encounter every conceivable price pattern, including the one that causes the 'death sequence' . It might happen tomorrow, or it might happen at a point beyond the end of the trader's lifetime, in which case his martingale is (fortuitously) a resounding success. But my point is that you have no way of knowing, and no way of testing, when it's more, or less, likely to occur. It's like playing Russian roulette you don't know which chamber has the bullet, but if you pull the trigger often enough, you'll eventually encounter it. In my opinion, that is very poor risk management."

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Does anyone know what is the problem here? I keep getting the message "trade is disabled". see the picture below

--- 帖子 #178 ---
my friend! You speak to the point~ If you know there are some promising EAs here, pls. kindly share the link.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
My point of view is that not one EA can do the job alone, they will ultimately fail at some point/s it must be a combination of EA and human intervention. That will be the best solution because an EA is a prescribed set of rules and unfortunately the market does not have a set of rules it follows. So it is ok to use any EA with low risk set and let human intervention take place to produce the best results possible. Good luck in your trading.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I'm not certain of this but am sure this needs to be done if not done already. Go to tools on your MT4 and scroll down to options. AT the options click expert advisor and ensure the enabling of trades is checked. Hope this helps. Enjoy your trading.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I'm still confused.....after so many years.... We will use human intervention at certain days or some special NEWS release. Beside that, i think we have programmed everything into our EAs. If EA failed, so did the manual operation. Would you like to show me a way out？or is there any chances you can share your exp. on it?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I don't understand what you are saying. One couldn't have programmed everything into an EA what an EA has been designed for is a specific strategy with specific rules. So let me try and enlighten you why an EA does not always work... if your EA say was in $500 profit using 3 open orders all of which are 0.1 and the EA didn't close them when you see momentum deflating, so you would not intervene and let them continue until closed even if there are losing rapidly? Secondly if software was so good then why isn't the best EA making trillions and owning the market? Software can serve as a good basis BUT nothing can replace the human mind... NOTHING... since the world is run by humans and not software, hence unpredictable events and the markets move because of human nature of some sort whether it be news or just some changing events, and not due to software, hence why markets are unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Not just one EA. for EX, i have 2 EAs one is 100% win in Trending conditions another is a reversed version which is 100% win in ranging markets. I manually switch them one to another according to market conditions, but I still can't win. Human intervention is NOT 100% CORRECT. I see you have many winner strategies in your explorer, can you share the EXP. about when to switch EAs?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I like you, developed my own two EA's. Like many EA's they take winners and there will always be many a time where the EA will get into a bad situation, once I first notice it's going to that mode and that is usually under certain market conditions I take over and try to use my trading skills to either come out of the situation winning or close out the open orders at the smallest loss possible. You are right when you say human intervention is not 100% correct. There has been many instances when I closed the trades at a loss when the EA would have closed them at a win instance and vice versa. The bottom line is the overall results must achieve a favourable outcome and you as the human trader must succeed in managing the open trades in order to succee\d..

--- 帖子 #185 ---
After all this you have been through....you know how hard it is to develop a winner EA... When EA got into bad situation , I never had a chance to fix it. That's why I'm here, i had a terrible EA and i screwed up.. I think Ducd's EA is a good trend trading EA with crazy lots increase, that's what i'm looking for. If you know who has a better strategy, pls. show me the link, i 'm really appreciated!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi Guys I've been testing this EA for weeks now, trying to turn a decent profit over a period of 1 1/2 years, so last night I tested EURUSD on a M30 chart attached is my results, it has a major draw down but it survived a year, trading with 0.10 lot. Looking out for you thoughts

--- 帖子 #187 ---
LOL @ your results... martingales always blow up. The fact that you played around to get nice results is proof that your money management won't survive long in the live market. especially when you used such a big lot multiple to get those results. Thats old increasing the lot size rapidly and only works very short term. But keep wasting your time and hopefully you open up an account with $200k or more in it and trade it using your lot sizing to get my attention lol

--- 帖子 #188 ---
You do not know exactly how my EA doing. I said many times, if you mean when a trader increase lots size - he use martingales, you made big mistake. Again, my EA not use martingales! Try to backtest it with spreate year, start with balance I suggested and see how it growing.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
It looks like you have no idea what is a martingale. It is very clear from your output that that you presented you are using lot size increments which are multiples. That is very clear from the green spike at the bottom of your graph that you presented but it seems you are ignoring that fact so expose the tests done per order and you will see precisely what I said is true. But you are hoping to fool inexperienced traders and you will fool them, unfortunately I have done more backtests then you have grey cells. My concern now is that you only show graphs and not the output because you don't want to expose the fact you are using martingales and I know what path you are taking. You want to sell your system eventually. Face reality no one does anything for nothing unless they know they will gain something from it. In fact let's see how good I am at detecting liars.. you are using about a 3 to 1 factor in lot size increases and you just might be hedging, that part I can't tell for sure. You might fool 90% of people here but I got the edge on you. GO AHEAD PROVE ME WRONG AND SHOW THE GRAPH WITH OUTPUT lol P.S If you didn't use martingale you won't get green spikes on the bottom or sometimes you just get all equal spikes.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Go and read through thread from post 1. I have never say I want to sell anything here. Never suggest anyone use it with live account. I show you here my EA, how it doing. I asked you (Everybody) take a backtest, and find out the best setting =&gt; WHY/FOR WHAT? - I said many times, the current version EA for backtest only, to know how it doing, good or bad, profitable or not. Final version still in construction. I don't understand what you call "GRAPH WITH OUTPUT" (My English is not good, in some case, I have problem to understand), if you mean source code, go away. Last word. take care what you said. How you detected liars here? What is liars here? For what? Please don't think anyone as bad as you.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Any body using on live account above said EA Please up date

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Tradability, if you are such an experienced trader, why are you even part of this forum, I think as traders we need to support each other, yes I agree this EA has the potential to blow your account very fast, but also have the potential to make decent profits, it's still in a developing stage, and I honestly cant wait for the completed EA. All this EA lack is a filter that reduces trades when market is becoming to volatile. Why don't you share your trading system, as surely an experience trader like you must know the holy grail of forex trading, that's how it comes a cross. Ducdaovn, keep doing what you doing, don't let anyone distract you of completing this EA, just one question is there no new updated version of this EA?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I don't mean to be offensive but, Why don't you open up an account with a LARGE sum and use this system to trade it, otherwise shut up, sit and enjoy everyone blowing their accounts. I don't like liars where he said he wasn't using martingale and clearly by his own graph he is. Then someone like you where I have seen that over decades comes and eggs them on only to see the same rubbish blow account after account. The thing is you're coming across now as a stupid trader knowing this will blow the account but still wanting to gamble. To make money is to not think like a gambler, think like a businessman. Simply and no offence , a loser will always be a loser and only they can change that so no mater what experience I share with you/him or whomever, no matter what knowledge I try to pass on which I tried to but it seems you're too stupid to understand and accept it lol, only you can make a difference I have no effect on your/their behaviour. So many traders know of the 2% of the successful traders and want to be like them but chose not to do what it takes.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
You ARE already in 2%, BUT WE ARE NOT! I dont believe you are in 2% when you are born...that's why we are here. Lots increase is risky and we already knew that... If you really want to help us, pls. give some constructive ideas.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Your issue is you don't like the truth and want to live out in dreams. The incrementing of lot size will blow it up eventually, no matter what you say and do this will happen. To survive a major move one will need to have it linear lot operation. I have said enough but so many reading this are so stupid and no wonder you complain about the 2% because you are responsible for putting yourself in that position. Overcome your stupidity and come to the other side so I can buy you a drink lol. There is another forum section that has potential to be a winner with some adjustments. Who wants to follow me there send me a message. I wasted enough time here and I have better things to do then waste my time here like starring at the wall lol bye

drawdown is too big.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hi people, as I said I'm testing on demo account with major pairs and metals with grid size 3. I don't know if it will survive but it's funny to watch take a look http://www.myfxbook.com/members/feli...232455/1693992

--- 帖子 #200 ---
You done a good job BTW, I suggest to test with account deposit minimum 10.000 USD. WHY? - In backtest, we saw EA can get highest DD around 5000-7000, and to keep account alive/survive with market, balance must big enough to cover max DD. Ofcouse this is DEMO only, why you have to start with acc balance=1000 only . Idea for EA? Why we still here, at this thread? - For sure, run this EA can cause big DD. BUT as you see, EA can run with multi pairs. The idea here, is when any pair goes in high DD, account balance still grow up from another pairs. And when EA done from survive, you can take an coffee, smile and enjoy your life... Is there any way to improve EA? - Sure, I have. I think you know about CSM (Currency strength metter, ask google if you don't know). The current version is for backtest, run with single pair only, ofcouse it can not carry CSM. In final version - multi pairs version, CSM will be included. For an example: with current version, EA will place BUY order EURUSD when it see a buy signal from EURUSD. But with final version (CSM included), EA will place BUY EURUSD only when it see EUR strengthening or USD weakening (AUDUSD+EURUSD+GBPUSD go up, and USDCAD+USDCHF+USDJPY go down). Once again, thanks felipebr. Let's see how she doing.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Ducdaovn, you right I should have started with 10.000, I'm sorry... anyway I have a good margin, 1:500... if I get a margin call I will start another test with 10.000 Congratulations for your EA it's very nice... your CSM idea is great and I think it will minimize the drawdown, if you need I can test it on my VPS and link with myfxbook. Please keep your great work and if you need a hand to develop it... I'm also a developer. Regards

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Everything still on the desk, just a good idea (As we think). BTW, I will try my best to keep/fire up our sign. Sure, we need your VPS. I will public final version here when done.

By my exp. play on muti-pairs is dangerous. Let's say we have 10 pairs running this EA, 9 pairs give you 5% each, total gained 45%, one pair in a big loss...and you are in trouble. Maybe we should add EQ protection function? limited at 20%? The solution is to avoid trading in tight consolidation....but how? this is a really tough question.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
hi since long time i did not write ok let's begin your EA is the worst . .... sorry to say that.... close it and try something else/ you have asked me to tell you my opinion most of is the retail traders are playing and trading with usd1000 to usd5000 and before long time back i was like you dreaming by an ea i fill it with 20k or 50k then boom i will be guru .. the next milionair//// no my friend.... all of these young eas are dreams and the nig eas are also hyip dreams... all at the end will lose and will make you crying sorry tryy to trade manually is better than any ea.... yes you can have ea to close a trade, to calculate the next lot size, to give you signal but not to trade.... the indicators in mt4 are all lagging , sucks , bad..... only one you should get 50% chance with it is stoch but eventhough it is still f....k . again i am sorry bye

--- 帖子 #205 ---
like you say all young ea are suck then why are you here it seems you did;y write since long time but read a lot 'useless' thread as you said...Then what is your purpose if you say it is useless and reading these thread?... Just wanna say EAs are method/tools, how to use is the vision of the trader, EAs have their specified period and some of them are profitable. You don't have the wise or just lose once then mad on EA is not a proper way to trade, it will only stop at the same level without improving your trading exp/skills

THE IDEA IS SIMPLE TO BEGIN WITH ONLY 500 USD ONLY TRY TO REACH 17000 USD IN 10 DAYS BY MANUAL TRADING STOP LOSS.... NAAA NOT ACCEPTED CLOSE ALL DEALS WHEN THE COLOR OF BASE FOUNDATION IS CHANGING FROM RED TO GREEN AND VICE VERSA ... OPEN TRADES AS PER THE STOCH ( I DO NOT LIKE INDIS BUT THIS IS THE ONLY TRUSTABLE 50% ONE ) CLOSE THEM AS PER THE ABOVE RULES IF YOU REACH 150 POINTS PROFIT CLOSE OR WAIT TILL YOU REACH TO CHANGE COLOR I DO PREFARE TO CLOSE ON 150 POINTS OR TO CLOSE ALL STILL OPEN AT CHANGE COLOR ---- YEA.. IT IS KIND OF STOP LOSS.. CORRECT... 12 HOURS PER DAY I ADDED ALARM WARNING IF I REC LESS THAN 50% SAFETYI STOP TRADING BYTHEWAY THIS IS THE SAME AS BINARY ROBOT OPTAION TRADING .... I WAS STUDYING IT TO SEE HOW THESE GURU ARE MAKING MONEY AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I FOUND THAT I WAS FOOLED BY THE HYIP THEORY OF BINARY OPTIONS ... ALL ARE FAKE... SO USE OLD SCHOOL .... your hands are the only trustable items in the world..... use your own manual trading style ما حك جلدك الا ظفرك only your hands will solve your problems.... good luck

Hi, would you please share this indi. Thanks

There is no worst or best EA. One EA only can handle some market conditions. If EA trading can not win, switch to manual will change nothing.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
no on the contrary manual tarding is the basis of the ea coding i want to code an ea what i do, i go like this and code it such like that, no no no. the coder will try to amke manual trades first to see if it is working then if the succes is more than 60%, why not, lets make the code , then the ideas will be generated .... then the code will be done but the case is that, the market conditions are changing minute after minute Brexit caused the gbp to fall down 17000 points in 30 mintes in all gbp currancies so lets say you have 12 pairs the 12 x 17000 point s = 204000 point ...........so many persons lost their money and may be thier assets and their lifes , last year chf went down 22000 point in a sudden move ..... think.... this year japan jpy to -0.1% instead of moving up the pair it went down with other 15 jpb pairs such as the dragon pair gbp/jpy from 170 to 150 ......oh my heart the ea will work like a donkey but it will not understand the market moves while you are human and you will understand that on brexit do not touch your computer... i was out i did not touch it so i did not loose whie if the robot is there then it will loose .... think it is not our game it is the game of the big guys there we are playing in 500 usd to 1 milion .... but they are moving the market agianst the gravety by trillions usd/chf went down last year 22000 point in 5 minutes and went up again back 22000 point ................which robot can understand this move..... none... hhhaaa i saw in the 60 sec binary options robots are making tardes as per 6 indi ( trend, cci, rsi, toch ...etc ) fake fake fake fake i do not how to express my findings in english as it is not my mother language....... i like mathmatics/////// 1+1 = 2 1+1 never ever will be 3 what is seeming too much good it will be too much fake.

Hi Samer1970, I've realised you've traded in 5 mins timeframe. What is your recommended TP SL for such a small time frame?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
dear owner of this thread, i am sorry that i am typing here about manual trading against your EA, but this might increase your knowledge to develop more your ea, i hope.... manual trading ideas : best method use 5 minutes, then 15 then 30 then 60 minutes i mean, in the excel sheet above, 6 pairs x 4 trades x 300% as you will see later on = 72 trades or easier for your life : 1 pair x 4 trades x 4 time frames ? = 16 lets use the second idea use any manual strategy open 1 hr frame, make as per your signal 1 trade open 30 minutes make as per your signal 2 trades open 15 minutes make 3to4 trades open 5 mintes you will make 3 to 5 trades wowo your income will be good from one pair it is better than any ea i will show you here example

Thanks for your great heart but it seems you should not be here and doing something that is not capable to the origin thread EA, I know you would say keep your mind out of the box but your method is not suitable for this thread, you should open a new thread and share your thread's link to this thread and see is it capable to this EA, if you said the colour stock has 50% chance why don't you use your 50000000000 EAs skill to make a new EA and test it on mt4 as you said 50% chance, let us see but with a new thread .

Join you to sell us what? You already wouldn't pass on one of your indicators to a member here which clearly implies you're here to engage people to sell them something eventually, not now obviously but later on hmmmmm

I cant understand what you are saying.... whatever CHF drop 2200 pips or GBP dorp 1700 pips, the former is center bank policy, the later is voting result. Both of them were listed in calendar, who in their right mind will run martingale EA on those days??? If you program it in correct way, there is no difference between EA and manual trading. Only newbies will believe EA is a set and forgot money machine.....WE DO HAVE interventions on our EA, dont we??

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Agreed.... What do you think about this one? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=595052 Besides this EA, i think he/she is telling the truth.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
It's very good BUT I want to see verified results. The reason being so many unverified results are tampered with, if they verified then it is a nice strategy but I need to check each trade to make sure the account is protected at all times and will not blow up under duress.

Hi everybody, I saw many replies today. It's good, but please keep in your mine, debate, but on the basis of mutual respect, cautious, but do not envy. All we know and understand why we are here. If you have any idea and you think can improve our life together, improve our trading skill, improve our strategy, improve my EA posted here, let's go ahead. From Samer strategy, I have some idea, will upgrade my EA use his strategy soon. Why I have not public final version? Just because for sure, my EA can blow up account in some case. How to prevent/limit it? I still have no answer, and continue finding one.. And because that, please stop post here any post/question about SELL anythings here. No one here need your warning, they have enough intelligence and vigilance to stay away from scammer. With me, if I successful to write a perfect strategy, a holy grail EA, I will tell everybody that I begin my service. You can follow, and pay for my service, or stay away, it depend yourself. Need not to give any warning here!

Do u have source code? it need some improvement.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
WoW~ a pretty good EA with smart hedging! ....where did you find it?? serious bug found

--- 帖子 #255 ---
VERY dangerous... your DD has almost wiped the account and that is with very small testing history so I guarantee you in a large history it would have blown up. Yuur testing MUST produce much lower DD to survive a long time in the real environment, or use a large capital but who would do that?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
This EA has too many bugs....i'm going to re-write it. It's petty easy to understand... In a trend market, it will use hedging to get out in both directions. (so the lot size will go bigger, that's why DD happens) In a ranging maerket, it guarantee 100% success.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
you can code?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Can you share some exp.? You are doing great...50% per month....lol

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Like what? Just pick good trades when the market has moved considerably and knowing it has to retrace, but sometimes I decide to take trades that are small (i.e small movement) and I always use multi signals which is hard to do. Anyone that wants to use my signals will be able to on mql5 site which I pasted the link on my page or send me a message and shall help you. Also the attached pic is the results of my EA that I developed...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I know the "TCL1" EA is not complete yet. I am coding it myself. I have not yet coded to handle trending market properly. I will update with new version as soon as i complete it. Till then i want yours valuable testing feedback for improvement. Try altering EA settings, it may provide unexpected result..

--- 帖子 #261 ---
WinningSolutionv13.d works on Trending pairs very well but I believe ranging market can kill it! Anyway, I've made a trade explorer and testing it. You may see the result. http://www.forexfactory.com/shamim1981#acct.22

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Waiting for me... I will release new version soon, tried to keep max Dd in acceptable value.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi D.s: TCL1 is looking good. Please consider adding the following: 1. Add a candle range requirement. For example, If Previous or Current candle range &gt;60 pips stop trading. Then either let the trader reactive EA or use the following start trade time to reactivate EA. 2. Add Start and End Trade Times. No hurry, thanks Jess

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I was just looking at the results of some simple free EA with a consistent, smooth downward sloping equity curve... How beautiful it would look if one could just reverse the signals (buy instead of sell) and swap the TPs and SLs... What do you think?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Your idea is great but in a reverse market it will cause big DD. Partial close is especially brilliant!

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Damn good result....how long have you been trading in this market? Could you explain what is multi signals? A. group of pairs have same signal, then jump in? B. many indicators show same signal together, then jump in? Can you also share your story about how you become so successful? (not your EA, just your story) Loser thanks to you!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Signals can be reversed, but sometime the concept behind the EA is not so simple that we can just swap the take profit and stop loss levels. What if the code was developed to execute take profit or stop loss on profit of certain pips or loss of certain pips, this explains why the equity curve is smooth. Even you swap the signal it will act in the same way. This is just my hypothesis as i have been developing EA for long time. To satisfy yourself you could go with the swapping.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I got 10k real account, if DD is in manageable amount, I can use it in there....

--- 帖子 #269 ---
WOW you going to trade that martingale with 10k live?... You have much more guts than I lol

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Thanks for the feedback. The TCL1 EA is now around 98%complete with rare scenario where large DD can occur. Except JYP pairs, I was not able to get other pairs where this EA can be defeated. I have tested with 4 different pairs for long time and each test was a success. In the latest version I have reduced DD and added trading time for the day as per your request. As a bonus for your feedback, you can trade with this EA till August 2016 end. In return i want more feedback... Updated TCL1 attached here Attached File(s) TCL1.ex4 51 KB | 1,267 downloads

A heavy storm occurred at my location 3 days ago, and I lost all internet connection and energy. I will public new version here soon, when my internet connection available. With new version, Lots increase strategy (As many people named martingale) will available in input true/false. In some case, it's very good choice to push out from drawdown with big gain, but in some case, it can blow up your account... use it yourself. I forgot to tell you that with backtest, account still grow up about 300$ with instance Lots=0.01. @Shamim1981: You have to run backtest to find out which pair is useable with my EA. And then, please take a forwardtest for at least two month, you have to know what's different between backtest and demo. Event that, I want to inform you again, demo and live is more different! Ofcouse if you want to go ahead, I will send you a private version allow live trading for you, and it's free.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thanks god you are back! I will do forward test once your EA was released!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Welcome back Duc

--- 帖子 #274 ---
The problem is some time EA still will stuck in one trade and stop enter new orders by some unknown reason. This is a bug, i hope you can fix it next version,thanks

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I could not notice this bug. I think the reason EA is not taking more trade because it need to protect the equity as per your settings. There are settings for your min -ve balance before EA will start protection. You can alter that. And if you are telling Ea is not taking the initial trade then you again need to alter the settings which control the primary indicator trade triggering range. Still if facing issue then send me the snapshot of main screen with snapshot of data in expert tab too

--- 帖子 #276 ---
After partially close on Sell 0.8, it never trigger a new order gain. I already turned off EQ protection.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
this tcl1 is free ea or for sale?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Duc will sell it to you, how much are you willing to pay him?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
so much ea's to try and they are for free with source code.. black box dont for me

--- 帖子 #280 ---
no this is a blue box not black box lol

--- 帖子 #281 ---
For sale obviously.....

what my cut 68%? Easier to make money from selling EA's then from trading lol

perhaps also green pips box but for who sells

--- 帖子 #284 ---
good Idea ... you're hired for your imagination lol

--- 帖子 #285 ---

--- 帖子 #286 ---
lol Im doing some testing live with an EA... very interesting results but it's early days....I like the DD on it check it out.. https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/londone/1728446 Let me know what you think, it's almost as good as Duc's

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Sorry to disappoint you all. I have designed TCL1 for personal use only. I have not thought about selling.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I also need the snapshot of the "Expert" tab on your strategy tester along with the initial settings you have used. There are multiple strategy involved. Just by looking at the trade window snapshot, i could not determine the cause. But i still dont think it as a bug as i have tested on multiple pairs for more than a year in each pair i have never encountered it. A bug at this scale which will not take any new trade will kill the account instantaneously. Still i am going through the entire code again.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Just be careful about this kind of movement

--- 帖子 #290 ---
WOW you have skills in drawings I don't know how to do this on a PC lol. I am limited in my ability so all I can do well is trade. By the way if you have the same zig zag across it will blow the account. I have tried it many times before and if someone says I can try it on higher time frame thinking they are smart then they are totally wrong. This pattern will occur no matter what TF is used... experience is almost everything.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I went through the code and there is a unique bug found in one of the strategy involved in it... I dont know how to describe it exactly but you can say the overall better performance was due to this bug.. The bug was not allowing to open trade at certain conditions which has reduced the DD and increased the performance. By killing the bug the performance reduced to zero... I am working with an alternative strategy to replace that bugged strategy...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
thankyou!!!!!!!!!!!

So what will you do here?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
we need to improve MM on the EA.... but first I have an idea for finding possible open orders but I want to see how do you determine when to open an order and then compare? You have already seen what my indicators can do so I can share some new ideas once I can determine the best one that works with your idea..

--- 帖子 #299 ---
You right! What I need now is signal to open orders. The signal used by ea is very very simple and I can say that it's rubbish. I have plan to improve it by with a system shared in ff, but still need time to understand the indicator logic. I do not want to use iCustom function because it takes many resources and slow down our computer. I know your indicator is really good. If you don't mind, please share here or give us any advice.

It's very simple. 1/ Send me your account number, I will give you a private version, work with your account only. 2/ You can run my EA at your own computer/VPS, but you have to connect your account to ForexFactory Trade Explorer or MyFxBooks. Then you can give me these links as private or public them here. WHY? I want to know how it perform with your account, and improve EA if needed. 3/ To protect you, I request to open a account with minimum balance 10.000USD, or you can use cent account with minimum balance 100USD. 4/ EA for free, but please keep in your mine, I can change my mind anytime lol, but will inform you before I change anything at least 2 weeks.

Hi Duc Hope you dont mind me posting a simple MultiPair EA based on the MyPyramid........ The user can select one or more pairs of choice.....up to 28 pairs can be selected... I am currently testing on default settings.....

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Thank you I am testing it right now. What time frame are you running it on? I put it on M5 chart non traded pair. I selected true to trade all 28 pairs put only a few pairs came up on the dashboard. So I turned that to false and once I added all 28 manually in settings they all came up. I compiled the EA with the latest build 988 and 3 warning messages came up but no errors.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
You are welcome here, GVC. Do you have any idea to backtest EA with signals from multi-pairs? I also have a plan to code WinningSolutionEA work with multi-pairs based on your Dashboard shared at Dashboard Traing thread, but I afraid about it's possibility. @All: GVC is the best one at FF and you can always trust him!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
OK，Well, to test a few times more, thanks for your reply

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks Ducdaovn, I read that you wanted to do a multi pair version so i posted a sample here for you to use if you want....... Unfortunately it is not possible to test multi pair ea in strategy tester on mt4..... I am testing on M5 as well..... I originally put in all 28 pairs by default but changed it to 8 pairs so that some nana does not put it on a Live account and blow up..... If someone really wants all 28 pairs they can do as you and manually input them.....

I have opened an account with them BUT they are pathetic on customer service where they took a long time to help and even then you couldn't finish off the job. So I started with GoMarkets for now. I have heard Global Prime are good but then again those that give opinions are those that haven't made consistent profits to withdraw and test them. The broker I'm with now has changed my leverage from 1:100 to :1400 without my authority the scammers, they are trying everything to make me fail. BUT IT WILL NOT WORK! lol

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Go markets has super good customer service...but when they changed their liquidity provider the spread become crazy so i quit. Hope they have fixed this problem now. Why don't you try some big brokers? All brokers you played with are.....scammers or nobody... FXCM ducaskopy forex....etc....or other world top 10 brokers are less likely to be scammers. (except onada, this one is day time robbery)

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I have tried them all including Boston Technologies and Interactive brokers who only take customers with a minimum account of $10k and they cheated me BIG time! I found out from many years of experience when it comes to money NO one is to be trusted! My trading experience and technique is developed to overcome these scammers in all forms and shapes. To make money from trading one MUST be able to overcome the broker and their liquidity providers first and have a winning strategy to include this. By the way the I don't think I will reach the 400% mark with the broker I'm with before the end of trading season. They have all sorts of scams happening and are slowing me down, hence I think I will end up with about 300%. I will try to keep risk at the minimum with these guys since they are trying hard to stop me lol. I am running a system which has very low DD, it's actually 0 now but only been trading few days and I can't upload it here. It's a very interesting system and am setting up a PAMM account for it. Look it up on myfxbook under my account asset_developer Arbing.

What??? All of Them??? Are you saying all brokers are scammers? What kind of trick they've played on you? 1 connection lost? 2 High slippage? 3 requote? 4 Widen spreads ? 5 withdraw? I feel so disappointed when I heard this is come from your mouth... Are there any honest brokers exist in the world?... Sh*t, i've been spending 5 years on this market and you tell me all brokers are untrustworthy....what the hell should i do next? Give up is too late!!!

Hello Ducdaovn Take a look at this picture. Why the EA stop to open positions? Thanks gilfx

--- 帖子 #331 ---
You didn't know? That brokers exist to make money as much as they can? Did you think brokers exist to give money away? Actually do you know anyone that exist to give money away? Everyone is out there to make money and I mean everyone including you and I. So we have to know this and be prepared for any tricks they use. Fund managers, brokers, software sellers etc etc. I was going to set up a brokerage firm once and some software companies found out and starting rolling in with the different software they offer. You should have seen them. Did you think they offered software to brokers for free? DId you think they offered brokers softwares so brokers dress pretty or to scam the traders? This is the real world of business when dealing with money be on the alert. You know how many traders made money or gave money to fund managers or brokers only to find them packing up and running off with it? Buddy rule 1- Protect your capital always!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
What is brokers??? They are not traders! They should make money from spreads only instead of playing trick on customers.... Those NFA ASA BSA or whatever regulators, they do nothing when this happens??? I dont believe those scammers can survive in U.S or U.K

--- 帖子 #333 ---
LOL...Â Think smart!Â We are here to make money, and they are too.Â All they are moneymaker.Â

--- 帖子 #334 ---
All they are moneymaker, agreed~ BUT brokers make money from spread, traders make money from skills. That's totally different. Whatever customers win or lose, brokers win forever. If a business can win forever why they want to ruin their reputation by tricking customers? Thus I believe clean broker exists...or will appear in the future...

Thanks a lot to Ducdaovn for the great job. I have some advise 1. optimize the EA, run faster, backtest faster 2. make a mt5 version and test all the pairs together I am a forex coder too, we can talk about the system about mt5 version or anything else if you want. { email address deleted by staff }

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Jon making money from spreads isn't enough for them. There are two parts to brokerage the liquidity provider, and the broker. They are not usually the same unless it's a market maker in which they do as they wish. I've caught up in their scams far too many times like now my broker bumped up the leverage to try and unbalance me. I was and started at 1:100 BUT against my wishes they changed me to 1:400 thinking perhaps they will take me out of trades I probably will change it once I falter, but I am prepared for all their tricks the scammers. Not to mention the liquidity providers. They widen spreads near SL to take one out without price reaching the SL set. My one also will not allow me to choose my own SL and my own TP that's how much of scammers easymarkets are. On news on Friday I was lucky to grab as many pips as I could but I can tell you tried everything including high slippage and slowed down th platform lol BUT I refuse to go down without a fight! Mind you I only got 20 to 30 pips out of them where I should have had 50 to 60. These are some of the hurdles one has to overcome if one is to be successful at trading.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Oanda is infamous for it's spread widening. That's nothing new... Slippage is always working like this....no one should complain.... You set SL at 50.00, and price went up from 49.90 to 50.50 in one tick, actual SL is 50.50. That's not broker's fault...if he could find another broker to prove that 50.00 price was existed, then the broker tricked him.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
If you can pick your SL then you're lucky. My broker won't allow me to chose my SL nor my TP. I have to set them at the price they choose and knowing this I have to trade to overcome their scams, not to mention the spread widening near SL.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi, You have to check back yourself.. I run EA normal, and many people too. If you need any support, add me to your Skype list and I can live chat with you.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Simply move your ACC. to go market....you can notify your followers before you move. Try if withdraw is allowed or not.... It's better to use a decent broker when i start to follow your signals.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
By the end of the year i shall close the current easymarket live account and start with either GoMarkets or Pepperstone . I already am running several GoMarkets accounts and have traded with them in the past before they started to scam when I shifted away from them but like all scammers they reckon they have straightened up now with new owners etc. When it comes to money NO ONE IS TO BE TRUSTED!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Duc sorry for hijacking your thread but it's a nice cave to hide in lol

--- 帖子 #344 ---
When you start making money the scam broker may play against you, precaution is always better then cure. Are you using some software to identify the scammer? pls. share your exp. how to monitor broker's behave? So we can move to the clean one ASAP when sh*t happens...

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I do use some software but there is no produced software to detect everything.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hey Jon this is my favourite Live account which one can a large amount with the lowest DD on any forum. Check it out and let me know your thoughts.... https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/arbing/1743157

--- 帖子 #347 ---
What exact settings are people using for the latest winning solutions ea these days? and has it had good live results anyone? Thanks

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I don't know how to judge a system.....but if this is neither hedging nor scalping. 0.11 lot for 1000 ACC. is quite large.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Absolutely it is about 10% of the account size BUT notice it is in the market for a very very short time which implies minimal damage. Would you like to see the trading over a much longer period of time?... Check this link... http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Grin...rading/1436599 This shows that this strategy is a successful one and a safe one, in fact this records as the safest strategy I have ever seen over a sustained period of time. Nice to trade a large fund size on this due to the very low DD (i.e almost zero after 10 months of trading). I can't find anything that has this kind of DD for its reward which is an annual forecast of approximately 60%. You don't like it?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi tradability :-) This looks quality! How do I get hold of this EA? Thanks Reubs

--- 帖子 #351 ---
It's not an EA it's a PAMM account I have set up... if interested this is the link to follow Your referral link again - https://portal.grinta-invest.com/Aff...sset_developer

--- 帖子 #352 ---
That's strange because it says 'automated' and seems to be an ea taking trades and closing them very quickly... You just use an ea on the Pamm account though? I'm suprised the spread doesn't kills this ea though?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes that is correct... if the spread killed the EA would it be working so perfectly?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
So you will never part with this EA? ;-) sorry forgive me for being sceptical, but the trading world is full of lies, deceit and scams. I'm just interested as I haven't know anyone to overcome spreads within a few seconds it's as though there is 0 spread? Also why there are no stop losses at all when It's really a ticking time bomb that way, what would happen if the market randomly spiked? Couldn't you just have a small stop loss in as a safety barrier if the trade is open for so little?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Also as a side note, how do you get the winning solutions ea to work as I see it has had great results on your myfxbook too? :-)

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Wow you sound like you would invest millions but I understand being skeptical since I am this way as well. The EA isn't mine and for the market to spike at the precise time the EA trades is almost zero probability because you missed the critical part when analysing and that is when it trades. You saw the EA trades during brexit, non -brexit and other really bad conditions and it avoided them all. It looks too good to be true right? As for the answer to this... "I haven't know anyone to overcome spreads within a few seconds it's as though there is 0 spread" If you failed does that mean the world will be precisely like you?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Haha how did you know- I am the million dollar man for sure... Yes it does seem to good to be true for reals. But it doesn't rule it or you out my trading friend. If it does such short entries and it so piercingly accurate why don't you do bigger lot sizes and become very rich? Also am I right that you use the winning solutions ea too on a different account?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Also who's is the EA then?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
So let me be honest with you. The EA is too good to be true right? Yet it is being used on my account and like yourself if something is too good to be true usually it isn't true but I have displayed my own account and the EA belongs to the broker. My belief is that since the broker takes a percentage of the winnings for his system he will not scam himself hence I am like borrowing the system from him for a fee and in this case the broker is happy to get paid and so will I be it small amounts. This system I analysed a long time ago and abused the broker over it telling them there is no such system and I stand by my words and have the script if you wish to read me abusing them for it lol but you me or any trader cannot achieve such results and only the brokerage firm can. So they want a fee to let us make money which is fine BUT the main question is can the firm be trusted? For a small invested we can test them out the broker know I have the capacity to trade big and they also know I won't since I know my money isn't safe in the hands of any lunatic like yourself Reubs or them lol. I always control my destiny and always will hence why unlike you I am successful. So to cut this short the system works and has been for a long time but you and I are the same and the big question is will this broker be another scammer who takes our money and run or will you and I be another victim trading a losing system and losing your money with yet another broker? And that's why I have such small account otherwise I would trade a large account. I already told the broker you can't make me rich since ......

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks for the long message bud. So the broker it's self you are using to trade with have you a magic ea to take lots of there money but they are somehow making money in the process? I don't get where they make there money from as brokers only make money from you losing not from you trading...

--- 帖子 #361 ---
You don't know much about broers do you...lol Brokers aren't the liquidity providers unless they are the market makers. You are right though when a brokers offers to make you money one must question there motive, however anyway you look at it so far it is making money but the question remains can the profits or deposit be withdrawn. I shall find out one day but it seems the broker is taking some of the profits and so the brokers gets paid for trading volume and if he isn't scamming then these are his main income. Now if he scams then he won't make an income, what he will do is go out of business by running away with a few dollars. So since I am giving you a lecture I should be paid for wasting my time on educating you but if you knew all this already you wouldn't be whinging you would be making money trading lol So which is it?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi all, For a long time, I try my best to find out a best strategy, and let this thread for you. I waiting so long for a good idea, help me to improve WinningSolutionEA, but...

You are a bizarre combination of very rude and very helpful haha! Thanks- I think...

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hello friend. I have been following and testing your ea for some time (on demo), and i gotta say i am impressed. I want to test it in a live cent acc and help the development . I have seen some weird behaviour (as seen on the screenshot). The ea will sometimes buy on clear reversal signals. Will you charge money for the last version?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Yes that's true I am very rude and knowledgeable but one thing is I won't lie nor try and scam anyone and don't need to. The broker wanted me to assume that their account is mine and allowed me to assume that the strategy is mine but I won't have a bar of that.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
You taught me a lot of things.... 1 trust no one who wants to sell EA (EA is not good so he has to make money by selling it) 2 never trust brokers, keep an eye on them, move when they start to trick you...

--- 帖子 #367 ---
One more thing Jon and that is have faith in your belief if you are to be a successful trader, to be successful is like winning a gold medal, you have to go beyond what everyone else went otherwise you will not be a winner, you will be like them. Remember 98% lose so if you will be lazy or not go out of your way or sometimes try and other times not care nor work very hard etc etc then you won't succeed. You will have to be totally driven to succeed and even then most don't make the cut. Also some idiots think it's a competition. That's a typical loser gambling. Trading is a full time job not a job that you work when you feel like it, because you have to be there when an opportunity comes along. The markets don't wait for anyone nor moves like anyone want's them to. You will simply have to adopt to them, go in an out of them when the opportunity comes along, and if you miss one don't chase wait for the next and don't think about the missed opportunity nor be angry nor have feelings about it. Remember it's a job and has nothing to do with feelings.

To protect you, all EA I post here for demo account only. Anyone interest to run on live acc, please contact me for private version.Â At current time, I have no idea to sell or charge anything...Â

hi guys, im backtesting the V13h but only get losses, because i think this ea is an great idea i wanna test it on an demo account after backtesting works fine. maybe someone can tell me what im doing wrong. i backtest on default settings M5 on EURUSD and keep getting the result you see ass attachment.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
i've had turn on the ea for days but now it gets to turn off itself, do i need any license for it's working? thank so much

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Sometimes backtests dont prove anything as the market always changes! I would forward test it to find out its profitability and risk if you ever plan to use it on a LIVE account.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks for your hard work, when you share your ideas on this, it maybe got 2 way: one will help you find some bugs, some will feel disappointed cause it don't bring profit. Don't worry, please share your ideas on this, the communities of trader will help you upgrade your ideas. Cheers. Cố gắng lên Đức, nghiệp trade không dễ dàng

Hi, I have the same problem. The Log says: ExpertRemove function called uninit reason 0 Expert removed I did a forwarding test with version 13h on GBP/JPY for 8 weeks and since today this error appears. I use Metrader 4 Build 1010.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
exactly like me

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hello. The EA is good. What is the last version of the EA to run on real account? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Do you even understand what that graph means?... perhaps you would like an expert to interpret that for you? lol

--- 帖子 #380 ---
i know what it mean, if you think your the pro then you can tell me again if you want. but what i really wanna know is if i got some wrong settings or something. whatever ill try i never get an backtest in profit, and ill see people here that gets profits in backtesting.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I've got the same problem. At the end of the test the tester loose a lot. Why? Could somebody explain it? It is a good EA but I don't know why behave it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Yes that's easy to explain after having done more than 100000 backtests... usually this doesn't happen at the end of the backtest, if it did then your system wasn't that bad but I am confident in saying this happened during the backtests and this is because the account got margined out and ran out of margin to trade which means if you started with a much larger account this wouldn't happen so quickly so the bottom line is you carried large losses and it blew the account.

--- 帖子 #383 ---

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I think it takes time or experience to manage these type of slippage. I consider myself as a newbie still... What I do now... 1) If I have an open order prior to major news, I close or adjust my SL just in case of spread widening or slippage. My SL depends on news forecast and current PA. 2) I cancel my SL just a few minutes before my broker time at 12 midnight, and then put it back after an hour or two. While without SL, I managed my open trade manually. These actions have dependability if in case my open order is currently gaining enough green pips or waiting for a price to turn around in my favor. How about you guys?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
the big drop at the end can be two things: 1) end of your data : this EA opens a lot of orders and you are witnessing an abrupt close during the trading time, that's quite normal (even if this drop looks big) 2) stop-out : the EA crashed and broke the bank! This is what certainly happenned and it will happen in live trading as well : it's called "losing all your money". There is nothing to do : even with SL it will happen! be carefull with marti/grid!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
True and personally Marti is a NONO for me!

--- 帖子 #387 ---
may i ask why you do that please?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
My broker increase spread and slippage happens .... sometimes I just simply close my trade and take whatever profit I have or planned my trade entry and exits that I don't need to bother about such an issue.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Can someone tell me what's a leaderboard? Someone congratulated me for being on there and I didn't apply for one or whatever that is???? Hmmm sounds like someone put me there, maybe I 'm in trouble again lol

--- 帖子 #390 ---
When simulation ends, all the current trades are closed automatically (a lot beign negative), that's why you see that drop. Cannot wait for the EA !!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Your last active trades were stopped out because testing ended before target was hit. You need to find a time spot where all trades where close prior to the test ending and use that date for the end of test. Better yet run a live demo test for 3 months. Backtest just to be sure the EA works as expected.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
why ea is swicth off when i swicht on?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hello I have a problem with the EA. When I try it on demo account. I can not see the winningsolutionsEA text at right upper corner. As I see the previous post also claim this problem. What is the solutions? Thank You.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
The same issue on a real account. The EA ( WinningSolutionV13h.ex4 dated Jul 4, 2016 ) fails to install on a chart.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Same problem here...Can't get the EA loaded Message - loaded successfully and then directly after that... removed. This is on a demo account. Why is that?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
So?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
This EA, WinningSolution has expired. It will remove itself from chart without any notice. It's not suitable with everybody, and may blow up account if you do not know how to control it. After long time developing, I decided to stop this EA because too risky in some case. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Then you maybe tell us where is regulated... Never heard about broker who offer illegal practice as arbitrage or spike trading

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Every broker is involved in illegal practices but you're too naive to know or just blind to see what they do. All you know is what experience you have with them or what you read about them with your limited experience. They exit to make money anyway they can, and don't be stupid to think they exit to make you money. Their priority is to make money for themselves and those that help them in business which sponsor them for millions and it is certainly not you and I.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
You are right! Whatever strategy you use, if it is related to lots increase. it is similar to Martingale. eventually it will fail, just you dont know when. The only way is to set a stop loss for it. cause there is no such EA exist which can handle all kinds of market situations.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I all i tried and i make sl also its working good ....

--- 帖子 #82 ---
really good system bro...i liked it and now i will use in cent ac also

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hello, Can you share the mq4 and mq5 files with any winning set files.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hello. I am not a coder (just learning) and trying my hands in modifying this EA by GVC I got from the post. I have been struggling with trying to include buttons. No matter what i do, the buttons don't close trades. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
