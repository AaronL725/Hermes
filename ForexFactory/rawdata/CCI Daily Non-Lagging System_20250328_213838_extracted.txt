Hi, Everyone. Below I have attached a screenshot of my CCI Daily Non-Lagging System. You can also see my trades at TCMM. That's all I am saying for now. Thanks KingPips

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Can you share your setup with everyone?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi Kingpips, looks interesting, CCI is my favourite indicator, await your further input. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Keeping looking at the screenshot very carefully!!!!!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
The Red Candles are for Selling and Green candles for Buying, the white no trading but ranging. Daily Time Frame. You Look once a day when the new candle shows, on my time with Tallinex its 8:00pm Eastern Time Canadian Ontario. You won't get a trade every day, but this week its Bingo! When trades come they make good pips as you can see on the screenshot. You do not need to be on the computer all day, Just once a day for 10 mins. STAY TUNE You Smart traders.

Hi Tcmm Your system looks good..do u have a special indicator that draws the red, green and white candles...also how do u set ur entries and exists... Thanks Dennis

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Its 12:50am for me, Will be sleeping. Will be on later. Thanks

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Dear tcmm, Does the arrows paints open of the candle or close of the candle ? if at open we could get a 168 pips buy entry if at close we could loose out (I'm referring to your picture where first green arrow had given you a 168 pips where the next candle took every gain we had yesterday )

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Interesting!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Tcmm, Quite interesting, can you please elaborate more on this system of yours and kindly share your system indicators. Million thanks for this effort.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I think it is it or some modification - an idea is very simple and interesting https://www.mql5.com/en/code/8220

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks like:- After the zigzag has made a top or bottom, you then enter on the change of candle colour.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
a entry will only be valid after the bar is closed. The 168pip mark on your chart could not be a trade, after all the first bar need 24h to print, and the next bar was a 40pip bullish bar. - After that the price was bearish. And why did you first enter on 134.105 on you last and (still?) running trade, when the arow appears at 130.355 level? Happy trading. Br

--- 帖子 #14 ---
nice one just need more explaination and screen shot to trade the system .

--- 帖子 #15 ---
How long have you been trading!!! First of all, I enter when that first bar 168 pips did open, the bar turns colour on that FIRST BAR. Do you know the indicators Yet, NO. Second I enter late on that 134.105 but the signal was strong. Do You Know The Indicators Yet. NO. For The Signal It Self You Don't Need ANY INDICATORS!!!!! Thanks ENJOY YOUR TRADING!!!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I do have a signal on the GBP/USD to buy, but it is a Big Bar and if you look at the 1Hour chart it has a gap which means Strong Buy. I would watch it on the 1Hour and the 4Hour But also remember volume is low now in the Asia Session, Euro Session Might let you know. I am not putting the trade now. From a high 1.5447 to where it is now it's pulled back about 57 Pips. Don't Pull The Trigger If you don't have to. Remember I am working with a Daily Time.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi tcmm. Please share your indicators and template. This is easier for us to understand the system. Thanks n happy trading.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hello Tcmm please kindly share your system indicators Thank you.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
interesting tcmm. could you please share your indicators?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi traders, The author of this thread applied a standard CCI 14 with overbought (+100 Buy signal Green) and oversold (-100 Sell signal Red) levels to a D1 chart. This setup can win if you manage to 1) trade a full cycle from -100 (cross upward, Buy) to +100 (Cross upward, Hook down from level above, then Exit) from +100 (Cross downward Sell) to - 100 (Cross downward, Hook up from levels below, then Exit) All uncolored bars should be traded. The trading range should be wide enough, so that a sharp and strong opposite bar not to ruin your position 2) trade overbought and oversold levels only (+100 Cross upward Buy, Hook down from the levels above, then Exit), (-100 Cross downward, Hook up from the levels below, then Exit). Uncolored bars are not traded. Again the range should be wide enough. Still, this setup contains a lot of mishaps of different nature. As a result it's very likely to get unexpected sharp losses. I can post a CCI bars indicator if you like. Regards. alpv

--- 帖子 #22 ---
what about sup and res indicator?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
You are correct! I am an ardent trader of CCI in all its forms, CCI is very wonderful indicator if we know its right applications. And what is shared here is just one way of profiting from CCI. I think its period 17 not 10. kos

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi alpv, thank you for your good explanation, this is exactly what we like to read here. Clear information and not holding back the important stuff to make people begging for indis and information like many others love to do. CCI is realy one of the best indis out there and I am sure many of us would love to see your way to trade it. So if you like, please share your cci indi and some more ideas if you have. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Please do and with some more info. Thanks

Hi there again, I am posting an indi called CCI Custom candle. You can easily change its input (currently 25) to your favorite one. It also contains an audible alert when the price crosses +100 and -100 levels. There are two points in its presentation. 1) probably it needs some debugging, since an active bar (being already colored) starts loosing its color when crossing these levels. In this case simply reload the indi in any possible way. 2) this one is more serious: any strong bar that is opposite to the previous newly colored bar can force the latter to discolor due to distortion curve of the MA that is in core of the CCI indi itself. In this case reloading is obligatory, otherwise a part of the indi history would be falsified. In any case a standard MT4 CCI should be applied to the chart to avoid misinterpretation. Regards. alpv

--- 帖子 #28 ---
You are all wrong. Do not trade that way. The white candles in my system are ranging candles only. The green and red candles are tradeable ones!!! LOOK AT MY TRADES ABOVE ALL WINNERS MY WAY. Thanks kingpips

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Sorry Tcmm you have now sent me to sleep. You started off with some interesting points and charts, however many people have asked you to post your indicators and when other people do post helpful ideas you seem to denigrate their efforts to understand what is without doubt an interesting strategy. What is your purpose in creating this topic if you have no intention of sharing? Or helping others understand your method. Thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
OK. I will start to show the method are all you great traders ready. We all in some way or another went through a lot of losses and computer time and methods, some may be the same because of the indicators we all know, but there is a way to trade them. We all use them in different ways. You need to put the piece of puzzle as best you can to make the trade good. Like the right settings, news releases, looking back at lower timeframes, non-lagging like the CCI the right way. Little Secret About the CCI. If you put the CCI on the chart you guys say it does this and it does that. But look carefully when the CCI reaches a peak then goes the other way THE BARS still continue the opposite way interesting. But that's not the method. TO BE CONTINUE. ASK QUESTIONS SO FAR

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Lets For Once Take It Com. Nice and Slow We have Time there's No rush. We have a lot of good traders out there as a Group we can make things Powerful. Stay TUNE

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Now, because we have great traders out there lets work together not against each other. If all you great traders can add to this King Pips Method, well it will add more to make the puzzle compete right. So lets all get in a good frame of mind first. I am trying something different here as a group.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
We are all tired of all we do to trade the Forex, But let me tell you something I tried everything too, just like you guys.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
And? (what do you make of it?) How this observation can be useful? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
With all I went through in trading, Like News Trading, Scalping, 1 Hour Trading, 4 Hour Trading, EA"S, Volume Trading, and So On And So On And So On. Just like all you Traders RIGHT. But I have come in my mind to trade the Daily Time Frame WHY! STAY TUNE NICE AND EASY HERE.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
OK, DAILY TIME FRAME WHY? - First Of All You Trade The Forex Once A day If There's A Signal. You Have To Wait for the trade signal, but in your mind you want to trade and trade with loss after loss. You Need To Wait For it if you like it or not. Believe me when it comes it can be good pips, you will get some losses, What You Don't Like The Word Loss! Any way Number 1 -Daily Time Frame. Everything Cool So Far?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
There A lot Of traders Viewing Here, Some Must Be Real Good Traders For Sure. Remember Work Together Please.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
OK Number 2. Open the CCI Set The Parameters At 20. Make Sure You Have The Apply To at Typical Price (HLC/3) Levels Show 100 And -100 only no 0

--- 帖子 #39 ---
all I see so far is someone just making many many insignificant posts as if he just wants to increase the number in his post count on this site.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Everything Cool I hope so far Next Down Load This Indicator Which Was showed earlier by someone in the thread, but I will tell you how to set it and how to use it. Drop it on the Daily Chart Set the Inputs CCI Period to 20 CCI Price to 6 Overbought to 100 Oversold to -100 Leave Bar Width the same Leave Candle Width the same

--- 帖子 #41 ---
lets work together don't start and be smart!!!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
If I Go too fast It Will Make It harder For You Like This Its Right And Smooth, We are not all the same.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Now You Should Have The CCI and Custom Candles On your Daily Time Frame. Should look like this screen shot attached below

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Now you can set it up like mine. I can explain it better with the chart in front of us

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Lot of guys waiting right now for the continuation like it seems

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Now First Thing RULES: When CCI cross over the 100 you buy. If you see in my daily chart EUR/JPY just Finish a great trade of 641 Pips. Ok But look at the peak, when the CCI came down, Candles where still going up. This is Divergence. Happens all the time. This means 2 Things: You can get out of the trade when the CCI crosses back, because the candles still are up, so profit is not loss because of the divergence. Great!! You can take profits any where up there or wait when it crosses over because of the divergence, you do not need to set any take profit level. Great!! THE SAME WHEN YOU SELL Below the -100 and so on OK so far. Check Back on the history of the daily charts and see it does it all the time. You are taking the Trend in play to the Limit it. I have a few rules when this happens before you put the trade in, to make sure of trade trend. You will get some whipsaws, but if you look back not to many. Any Questions So far

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The White Candles Are Ranging Candles, look at the chart they go across but when they are green or red the trend is in play This is the Power Of the Way to Use The CCI

--- 帖子 #48 ---
What indicator are you using for the arrows that are showing up on your charts?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
It works Great On the Daily Charts You Can trade the other time frames, but you have to stay there and watch, you want freedom Daily Chart Is Way To Go. I have A indicator that puts the Arrows as you can see in my screen shot, but remember its a daily chart you look once at the start of day nice and com If you look at the GBP/USD it cross over yesterday, but with the British Elections and non Farm Payroll I didn't go in but it crossed the 100 Valve, Now you can look at the 4 hour and 1 hour on Sunday to see if the other time frames have the signal to back it up still. that's a another rule

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Can you share the arrow indicator?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Also when the CCI is crossing over the 100 to buy the Custom Candles change colour to green on the same candle if you want to go in at the start of that candle or you can wait for the next day candle to make sure or go with looking back at the 4 and 1 hour times frames to see the same cross over, maybe some of you Great traders have indicators for multi times share any thing to this for smooth trading won't hurt. Work Together Forex Traders 5 Trillion a day we have to get some of the pie

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Here Is The Arrow Indicator when it cross over 100 or below -100, it will produce a Buy or sell arrow, you can also set it up in metatrader for Alert on chart and email for daily chart

--- 帖子 #53 ---
At first reading without having a backtest or something it sounds to easy to be true. Would be the ideal candidate for an EA. But I will have a look at historical charts.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
You Do not Need a EA First Of all its A daily chart you are not trading trades during the day I tried the Ea What would happen it puts it in at the start of day, but you might not want to go in yet when looking at the 4 and1 hour candles. if you are one that want the Ea to go in when over 100 and back out when it cross below 100 you can on a daily chart. I back tested already it can double your balance, because its daily better look once a day. Now you said it sounds Easy To Be True you better believe, it because of the way it diverges when in that area all the time Its Amazing Traders!!!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
It's not as great as you described. You picked up just a good piece of a chart. You do not trade this method as I can see from your journal. There's no backtest so far and we have to judge from eveballing. I'm not saying this setup is untradable. EY is a good cyclist pair since it's only narrowly used in international trade. However the possibility of getting whipsawed is high.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Are you using a trend filter or are taking every signal?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I will take every signal when there is cross over but the GBP/USD did cross yesterday but you have time its daily, I didn't go in because of the British Elections and Non Farm. Look its daily Chart the beauty of this also you have time to be a wear of things that are around before you put the trade in. The signal 100 or -100 cross over happen all the time look back REMEMBER IT WORKS GREAT ON EUR/JPY, but if you look at EUR/USD, GBP/USD, CHF/USD, and AUD/USD there Find.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
heyy tcmm can u help me.. my arrow is too close to the candle.. any way i can make it it little bit far from the candle... and is my setting correct

--- 帖子 #59 ---
You Can Use Any Trend Filter With It. I am going to give this Filter Indicator that I use, Here Is My Screen shot of what A Use.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Your settings are correct. My Candles are close its ok as long as you can see it

--- 帖子 #61 ---
How about these red bars? Definitely they are losers. The big ones.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
and 1 more question is this a valid signal? thanks tcmm

--- 帖子 #63 ---
What Currency?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
oh sorry! GBPJPY...

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yes it went in yesterday and it made 407 Pips, 407 pips in 2 days at $5.00 a pip its $2034 What A months pay on 1 trade, 1 currency. but now if you look at 4 and 1 hour the CCI is back under the 100 I would maybe wait to see if those time frames show a over 100 and take the trade. But if you saw it yesterday and went in BINGO!!!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Remember!!!! Daily Chart Once A Day Big Pips Less Trades More Pips!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
No They are daily Candles I don't use the indicator each candle there made profits When it went over -100 or 100 they made profits What You went Back That Far 2007 To thing They were wrong The Indicator opens on the next if you what to wait but I check on the daily charts and do what I said in the thread Listen I played around I long time and study it. Don't try to bring it down It is what it is. No indicators just watch Price Action, Divergence, Trend Pickup, Because of CCI 100 and -100 High Valve Trend

--- 帖子 #68 ---
so its best for me to wait the 1h and 4h cci to go up above 100 again for me to enter the long? thank you tcmm

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Tcmm Thank you for sharing this great system, please what is the best time to trade the system

--- 帖子 #70 ---
And Fix your chart like I said Not with those candles it not clear People Do it right If not its wrong. Set your charts like I said If I tell you to turn right why are you turning Left?????

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Can you please share the filter indicators you use with the setup?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Yes, Yes Yes Yes Its Coming

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Nice!!! I like your teaching style as well. Very clear. Thanks mate! I was just setting up the SLOTS EA's plugins as such

--- 帖子 #74 ---
My preference is cci 30 on daily charts based on a month. Why 20 for you? Here's the HA cross indicator used in Slots. Leave the top settings false and just setup the rest Slots can be found here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=446654

I assume you take a trade on a not yet closed bar the moment it crosses +/-100. Is that's right?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Nice BillYon Everything and Every body's Help, and Exper. Well come

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi tcmm, Thank you for your system. It looks great and promises some sure pips in the daily time frame. I am subscribed. Could you please upload the CCI indicator you use so that I can apply it to Typical Price (HLC/3). The CCI indicator given in the MT4 Platform doesn't have the option to select the application of price. Thanks again. Roy

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yes, But at the Day when a candle appears, I check 4 &amp; 1 Hour charts, any major news , also when I check the lower time frames if the CCI is not over or under you might wait when they cross then put the trade in the Daily, Sometimes in Euro session, because when you have a daily bar open it opens in quiet trading, but the Eur/JPY will open a few hours after and then see if it is over or under 100 or -100. remember its Daily you have time even if you miss pips it can go 100,200,300,400,500,600, you can get great number of pips check back it shows trades you could of gotten

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Yes it does go to the top of metatrader and hit Insert then indicators find CCI in the Oscillators you will see it there

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi tcmm, Thanks a lot for the right direction. Have a nice weekend. Roy

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Again Your chart should look like this. you can add your indicators but keep the candles clear to see, other indicators on the chart below sides are o Here is Template

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Ok, I see your point. You sat on a trend and let it ride. About divergence in choppy market in colored area. Suppose a trader is scared out of the position at, say Level 200. The next day the market spikes to + 300. Will you re enter the same direction? Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I really Don't I would wait 2 weeks again if I have to for a fresh new cross over, remember Daily Time Frame brings Volume of pips. You can get 1 trade of lets say 650 pips X your what ever lots, lets say 1 lot. A Dollar A pip is still $650!!!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi What settings do you change in the custom indicator to get the white ranging candles? When I add the indicator in Meta 4 it is only green and red candles. Cheers

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hello, tcmm. Thanks for interesting system. But here is one problem - an CCI Custom Candle can repaint last 2-3 candles after chart refreshing. Here they were red or green, and after the chart refreshing they have become gray. This also wrote by alpv - post 27.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi TCMM Since we have different brokers,and their daily charts open and close in different times,then my daily candle is different than yours or any other traders. can that issue makes a difference for enter the trade? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I tend to think that 10 min price check per day would remain an unreachable goal, unfortunately. On Day 1 you have to sit on 4H - 1H charts to catch the trend. On Day 2 and all consecutive days you will use the same charts as there's no means to control possible sharp reversals since 100, 200, 300. 400 are only abstract levels. On the other hand using Lambert formula of CCI you can define targets on each particular day. Regards. alpv

Hello, everyone and thanks to tcmm for sharing the strategy , I will try and watch this for a while, as I only have a small account balance. Also I have loaded this but I have not got the colours right I have green ranging and green up, which could be confusing and I have a green arrow to buy which I think is in the wrong place ? ...... Any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks ..

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I have been using the custom chi for sometimes now, I have not seen it repainted before, but it would be great if you can show it with graphics how it repainted kos

--- 帖子 #93 ---
This is seen on live chart. I will try to show an example of repainting on Monday

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks shiva

--- 帖子 #95 ---
hahaha... Sorry man but the arrow just made my day Anyway, thanx a lot tcmm for sharing this strategy of yours. Gonna try it the week ahead. Btw, is it OK if I want to use it "continuously" on hourly timeframe? Assuming I have plenty of time. Thanks

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I don't see value in timing the entry with cci crosses on lower timeframes. I would more rather look to seeing the 1hr and 4hr in the same direction against their open to time entry. What cci settings are you using on the lower 1 and 4hr?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
cci 90 50 , -50 Gives a bit more room so that taking the cross at candle close is valuable as well when you catch that home run trend. Also you can draw a line in the sand after the cross to denote momentum. Round number cross, retrace breakout...whatever and you're in there. Really no need for too much back and forth analysis. The cci cross is what we are after.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
nice thread my only question you trade only with the trend are you ????

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks guys for sharing that strategy ,after some tough about it will try my own template then let you know how i am going thanks again Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi all, Thanks for sharing this system. I have a few questions. Is this a standard CCI Indicator or has anything been modified to it? I read the thread and assume the rules of this system are very simple. Am I correct in assuming the following? Daily Charts - Standard CCI (20 period) with Up and Down levels of +100 and -100. Buy when CCI crosses above 100 (on close) and sell on cross back below (immediatly). Sell when CCI crosses below 100 (on close) and sell on cross back below (immediatly). Are these rules correct or do I have it wrong? Is there a fixed stop that you use or do you only exit on the cross back? I checked a few things based on the very simple assumption of the system I explained (See above). Somebody posted a EUR/JPY chart so I decided to replicate this. (So his settings where 30 which is now also what I set my CCI to in this case) I'm only trying to contribute a bit to this thread so for the OP of the EUR/JPY chart .. Nothing personal I think my first chart replicates the originally posted chart pretty well ? When i run this on a EUR/JPY chart since 2008 I get the second chart. So unfortunatly, (assuming this is the system you are trading) it seems like this might suffer from some Lotto Bias. If i am wrong in my assumptions, please let me know how the system is supposed to be traded ! Lastly, I also changed the parameters a bit ranging from 10 to 50 on the CCI and tested different (major) pairs. The system did not perform great on any.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I also would like to run this on 1 hour chart and curious what settings if any need to be changed for it to work best.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
This strategy is being tweaked to death faster than any I've ever seen. Why not first try it as it is and see if it needs modifying?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
we do not modified or tweaked to dead at all, everyone try his own way to trade but the fundamental idea one the best.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
all With strategies like this one you don't need to worry so much about the entry and a bunch of filters to try and get a more precise entry - CCI should be enough. What you do need to be concerned about with this method is how to get a precise exit. If you look at the trades with this method you can get the entry and some good gains but you will notice the first grey bar after the green/red bars is often a reversal that wipes out most of the gains or provides a loss. That's the challenge with trying to get gains at the end of a trend. My advice would be to focus on how you can get exits that provide for consistent profits.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
sorry guys but this is not a system this is gambling and sorry again for my bad feedback.... good luck

--- 帖子 #106 ---
gambling??? on what reason that this is gambling?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Of course it's gambling. Trading is gambling period given the percentage of those who reach success. We are all here developing and we are all at different stages on the yellow brick road... Let the process continue...

--- 帖子 #109 ---
This is no Gambling, this is a Good system. The system only allows u to ride the trend only, which is the best

--- 帖子 #110 ---
what you don't understand don't abuse, how is this gambling? kos

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I agree with Kos on this one....why is this gambling? We are taking calculated risks here, we are putting the odds in our favor.....not just taking positions heads or tails. Even the card readers in the casinos are not gambling, they know what they are doing, they know in the end there edge will end them on the positive side. Gambling is doing something blind for me. Then again it is how each see what they are doing, for some it is a casino for some a profession. 4x

Hi Everyone, I am Sorry For the Delay To answer, But my Mom is not going to make it. In Bed for 2 years now. I will try my best to answer this week. No daily CCI trades so far. Thanks

--- 帖子 #115 ---
If Good Entry Daily Time Frame 100 SL is Fine, But you will get a cross over but then it comes back over again, if it does take it out it may only be usually a small pip loss. But if you check it does not happen often

I see you joined JULY 2011 You must of done a lot of gambling since then. Where are Your Investments and Pension In A Gambling File Too

--- 帖子 #117 ---
You Can but you must stay on the computer to watch it, If You do make sure your in the Euro and USD Sessions Also look back in the 1 hour EUR/JPY Chart History

--- 帖子 #118 ---
OK, Read Care full. Lets says you have a buy, and On the Daily Charts its cross over the 100 made 4 Candles with 300 pips. When you see the CCI start to turn back which is divergence you can take all the profit or Half or wait when it cross back down over the 100 and get out. That's when you still made profit and the Candles turns White Period which is ranging if you look at the EUR/JPY Daily Charts

Hi Guys, I can be on all the time. But If some of you are set up and trading Please if Traders need help post and explain. Keep in mine that when a cross over happens it can cross back on the same candle for a small loss but when you get most cross over on the same daily candle you can see in history the big volume of pips it makes, its peanuts to catching the trend because remember CCI Divergence Explained in earlier Threads.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hey, thanks for the speedy response, I have added that to a Eur/Usd chart and it looks good and has a sort of Macd with it , so I presume that Billyon has the other Macd bit ? , I will ask him nicely if I can get it and see if I recreate yours which looks brill... Thanks again , may your pips be plentiful and regular...

Ok I am back again Just want to tell everyone My Mom Passed away today. Its fine she went peacefully and was 85. I will be less on for the next 3 Days. I have some more Info. on the CCI. Thank You.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Ok, Another thing the CCI shows is this. When the CCI has crossed over the Value Lines of 100 or -100 and is going with the trend, look at the CCI Daily of course and see back on the CCI where there was the highest peak the CCI made last. Now when you see that get your cross hair and see where the candle is trading, because if the price get past that back history peak then the price will usually make that candle long and great pips, its call momentum CCI shows this. here is a screen shot of back history of when this happens this gives you a idea of how much of more pips you can get. Happens All the Time CCI POWERFULL

Have been following this thread with interest. Have you considered using 240EMA for trend continuation Condolences tcmm

Thanks Yes you can But a 200EMA is better But the way the system is cross over of CCI Value 100 and -100 for trade signal you don't need EMA CCI does what it does

This indicator give a massive wrong signals, even on daily... look: Attached Image (click to enlarge) How do you use it? Because entry settings you write, cross 100 and green doesnt works...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hi Tcmm, EJ just about to cross +100 for a buy

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Those do happen sometime, but if you look at your chart how big are the pips in those trends look by eye. You cannot get 100% FOREX impossible!! There are 6 massive trends there count the positive Pips against the negative and see the different. 2600 pips positive and about a few negative. The the I check that you put X on some are good trades too, Plus your broker chart is different than my. I

--- 帖子 #167 ---
No the value is still at 70 not 100

--- 帖子 #168 ---
All of those "massive wrong" signals made profit or lost a small bit compared to the big winners. Keep that in perspective. Manage risk accordingly and all will be well. On daily look at quarterly/year gains/losses for assessing profitability of a system. Macro not micro... It works.

Settings indicators and template. The training wheels indicator tells you to Wait, Only trade short, or Only trade long. This is base on the daily and hourly chart being in the same direction. Can use to time the entry from the hourly candle during the cci cross.

Yup, but that trade was put on yesterday for me.... You are trading the close of the crossed candle which is fine. EDIT Oh...I use CCi 30 so that's why

--- 帖子 #197 ---
hi all, hi tcmm, my most sincere condolences, may your heart and soul find peace and comfort as soon as possible. billyon be careful and draw trendlines ... usdcad must confirm...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks No need for lines and such. Confirmation was at the cross of -100. Trend defined by what's actively going on. Prices are trending away from days open and if price turns i'll take what I can including a small loss and jump back on if need be. That's trading. Fishing for the big catch and throwing back the babies. CCI cross -trend HAS cross- trend MACD - trend Can remove all and only trade the cci alone and do well

--- 帖子 #199 ---
ok maybe I've lost a few step ... then, say, summarizing the rules of this system are: +100 buy -100 sell Daily TF. no other confirmation request. it's right? but (please take my words in a constructive way, absolutely I do not want to be misunderstood and go from critical aseptic) What is different from the method of simply reading the cci indicator designed by donald lambert in the '80s? may be there is something that I did not understand...(?)

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Basically I confirm on the hr and daily with MACD and HAS cross in Direction of trade The systems say's to confirm on the 4hr as well. It was a go there as well. All the light were green and so is my trade. Piptastic right now. LOL Exit when you see cci diverge from price or your own style.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
You are absolutely right. This is a genuine strategy suggested by Lambert. However since its inception some new features of CCI indi were discovered. One of them is to trade full cycles. Long entry from - 100 up to +100. 200. 300 etc. Short entry from +100 to -100. 200. 300 etc. In other words, all bars including colorless ones should be traded. The ability to trade this very setup is the coolest thing in the art of trading CCI. Regards, alpv

--- 帖子 #202 ---
eur/usd long? D1, H1 and H4 above 100

--- 帖子 #203 ---
well said! I use icci from a little time, and I'm still discovering, specially in htf and I must say it is a momentum indicator really really powerful (imho) if you learn to read it well and carefully and combined with proper analysis. valid 'alarms' from divergences both in entry and exit. and combined with a proper PA you can really do well in most of the market situations..

--- 帖子 #204 ---
thx billyon then we start to add some rules, entry must confirmed by 1h, 4h, macd and HA cross.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Bill - did you set this up on auto trade using Slots EA or are you doing this manually?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Not on slots because the cci is set for a closed bar after cross. I Have other settings for slots

CCI BUY CROSSING OVER 100. AND CROSSING OVER -100 TO SELL WATCH 1 AND 4 HOUR. I TRADE MAINLY EUR/JPY, BUT OTHER CURRENCEYS CAN BE TRADED, LIKE I AM TRADE HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE TRADING THE CCI THIS WAY IT CATCHES THE MAIN STRENGHT OF THE TREND AND IT has divergence TOO POWERFUL!!!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Doing it this way white candles trade if you look at the daily charts ie: EUR/JPY, the white candles RANGE, But if you look at the Green and Red they pickup the main trend and Huge pips on a daily when this happens. Now when the CCI as made a lot of pips which will be at its peak or CCI Line coming down you can take your profit or wait when it crosses back down over 100 same as -100. because of the divergence POWERFULL !!

You're complicating it. Keep it simple. It seems to be profitable with the bare minimum of rules. I would keep it that way.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Bill Let me tell you something. In the forex its very hard to predict where price is going right ok. Now you do have some tools because of price action where price can go. Like: Break Of A Triangle. 1, 2, 3 Move. Pivot Points. Divergence They Are powerful and are always forming and when you do a method like mine and see that it makes The Radar Strong. It will not Complicate because the are on the charts anyway! You try To Keep your losses low.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
White arrows point at full cycles. They are 100$ wins. Blue arrow is a broken cycle. Needs re-entering long (small loss and good win). Red arrows are broken cycles. Needs re-entering short (break even and win) I have an EA that works with broken cycles

It's your system and your thread. Whatever works for you. I've been trading a long time and in my case combining methodology has never worked. It's like eating. I love ice cream and I love spicy Mexican food. They're both my favorites. If you stir them up together, you have something inedible.

29 years here. I started with futures.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Does the arrows appear at the start of the candle or does it appear during the duration of the day? Reason I ask is wouldnt you have to keep looking at chart on daily to see when it touches 100 or -100 or does it typically appears at the opening of the daily candle?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
WOW....16 years and 29 years..... I started 25 years ago ...futures too.... it is nice to know there are traders that like spicy mexican food... (with beer), just joking ....with experience that have been around the block..... you learn a lot.... trading pork bellies and etf's and bananas... if you are still around you made it cause this games takes a lot out of you....

--- 帖子 #225 ---
It depends on the value of CCI, if it remains above 100, than the color wont change. This strategy actually makes a prediction about the daily CCI that will continue move above 100 once crossed from below. But if CCI turns down immediately after the crossover, then sure the color will change, and you better exit at a small loss.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
ok Thanks.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
hello guys, just wondering where i could find Tro Training Wheels , it looks like very helpful when it combines with this strategy. thanks!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
So it's better to wait untill daily candle with arrow close and then open trade? Or if the arrow appears wait an hour or two and after that time if candle still has the arrow we open the trade? Sorry but i'm little confused. Maybe because english is not my mother language and i don't understand everything wright...

Guys, EJ just about to cross +100. Thanks

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi tradin' guys, I think I have found an excellent exit indicator , befor we all are giving up our hard earned profit. I got the indicator yesterday for nothing Ok, before the cci can get back (long) towards the 100 zone, we get out of the trade: 1. when the fast moving average is changing the color 2. we can get back in, in the case of the cci goes back away from the 100 zone, if the fast moving average again changes the color! Try it.

--- 帖子 #239 ---

yes, youre right very good but I think the moving averages changes is much more simple. I will try it both ways

Just an additional thing to look for. Especially because trading with the very important divergences is not that easy as many people think. So if such a setup accures....heads up ...and combine it with tcmm`s system. Should be a nice little help.

How can you enter daily trades only when CCI crosses 100? Wont there be a lot of false signals?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Catch-up on the thread. And No You we make huge pips

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Saturday is coming so i guess that CCI will not cross the +100 line today...maybe monday

--- 帖子 #255 ---
My understanding is that we should confirm the trade with h1 and h4 crosses otherwise there will be a lot of false daily signals

--- 帖子 #256 ---
There is no signal, why did you enter? Just learning

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Top of the morning Genie, the difference in the opening of a new daily bar is what you are seeing.... some brokers open a new day at 5pm, 8pm and mine at Oanda is at Midnight EST. The signal will be slightly different cause of this time issue... Advice is to Trade your broker's opening of new day with a fresh cross signal.... No need to have 3 different brokers platform up and running cause of this issue... i scroll through all the currency's at a new day, and then chose one that meets the plan of engagement, and ride the trend till it ends.... "Be careful what you wish for, for you will give it"

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hello, speaking about cci, macd, etc. Does anybody have a indi to draw S/R and trendlines into the subwindow to get an alarm when one of the lines is touched or broken? Couldn `t find one yet.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Good day Tcmm Firstly I want to thank you for the system, I am short term trader(intraday) and my target is only 30 pips/day on 3 entries( TP=10 pips each) or minimum target of $500 per day. I have been testing your strategy on 1hr time frame mixing it with my initial strategy ( ADX + ma) and the daily opening line, only buying above opening line and selling below but after confirming the conditions for a buy/sell, I only took the cci candles from your indicator and since starting this strategy this week I have not had a loosing trade and I take my 10 pips TP within an hour and only looking for 3 entries/day. So I repeat thank you for sharing the cci method. God bless you Regards

--- 帖子 #260 ---
hI wolf300, here is your second regard, I thinks its working with build 600, you can set MA, MACD and Stoch Happy Trading for all of us

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Thank you andreas, did you check a bit of history for my macd triple divergence suggestion? It is part of a pretty expensive trading system and it works that good because divergence between price and indicator shows that way real exhaustion of price. Like a taut crossbow in the second before shooting for a bit of imagination. Crossing lines below/above sero is a good signal anyway. ....an hour later now, cci signal confirmed by your indis 2-line-macd and stoch histo. Lines crossed below 0, macd histo up to 0 and stoch histo 14,3,3 crossed above 0 at the same time. Works great, thanks again and tcmm thank you too.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
My System is about CCI Crossing over 100 and -100 it has Divergences But its only another Radar that shows when the CCI line reaches a peak it will Divert while The candles are going up.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
its a good system with much profit potential, only There are always many ways for exit, it depends on oneself. There are many ways to get to Rom.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
The cci divergence is great, sure but its difficult to reenter when the cci turns back

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yes You can exit the way you want its a Daily Chart you have time when to take profit -You can take the profits a bit at a time. - You can take the profit when CCI line reaches a peak. -You can take profit when its cross back over the 100 or -100 if its made a lot of pips because then it diverted away from price while candles were still up.

Do you hold your trades over the weekend?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Yes On This System Being Daily, But if your doing Intraday Trading you shouldn't hold trades

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Good, Relax, Not rush in trades, Not being on your computer a lot, Wait for Signal to come, Makes Huge Pips even with your little losses. Great to just trade the EUR/JPY only like I try To do Because I am in Thread now I am doing other currencies. You should just trade EUR/JPY Like I do. Check the back history on it with the CCI cross over it works and makes Huge pips even with Losses. But if you want to trade others you should only trade EUR/USD, USD/CHF, and maybe AUD/USD, But still if you like being on the computer you can catch 1hour, 4hour trades, more trades though. Good with EUR/JPY Thanks

--- 帖子 #273 ---
1st to TCMM thanks for sharing and doing the back test analysis ( I was just going to advice others not to make it complicated it is very simple system) 2nd all the indicator are from this thread except - 1. Abonacci - which is here on FF 2. CongestionBreakout can be found here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=7779899 - I find to help with some false signal - not going to get 100% 65-75% wining system - will make you some consistent profit. All who is looking to nail 100% will not find such a thing. Again this system look real good on EJ and EU which is what I trade EU 1st EJ 2nd

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi Guys I have have created a CCI EA hopefully to take BUY and SELL opportunities. (PLEASE NOTE-- this is my first attempt of coding an EA, hopefully I haven't embarrassed myself by posting it here) This EA will wait for confirmation on the close of the previous candle before a trade is executed on the open of the current candle, I have also added a EMA which can be turned ON or OFF so trades will only be executed if in the same trend. eg a BUY will only occur if CCI conditions met and Price is above EMA. and reverse for a SELL My testing so far has proved that having EMA filter is proving best. Hope this helps (screenshot for the year 2014) dags

Dags, Your EA has some promise. Is there anyway you could add the code to allow us to trade it only during certain hours? Would like to test it only during london and US sessions. Thanks for your contribution.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Thanks for you comment I will give it a go, I have also amended this code and added the ADX filter for a Strength Of Trend indicator, this filters out all trades under a Value of 25 where Trend is low and not likely to continue ie. removes whipsaws it will also increase Lotsize on high trending trades. To increase Lotsize, change the LostsizeBonus in settings My backtesting shows best for 4H TF - AUSJPY CHFJPY EURJPY GBPJPY USDJPY EURUSD GBPUSD Daily TF - AUSJPY GBPJPY USDJPY EURUSD GBPUSD GBPAUD GBPCHF THIS IS MY FIRST TIME CODING AN EA- Please check for errors Future changes: (if any experienced coders could help would be much appreciated) Allow for session trading Alerts (Arrows and Audible) check for exit using Highs and Lows of CCI or ADX

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Dags, Thanks for all your hard work on this. I ran some backtests on your Ea and I found it to be profitable on H1, H4, and daily. The H1 backtest was for the last 3 years. It was the most profitable timeframe. I plan on running it on demo to verify the backtest. I think that only using it during London and US sessions will hopefully limit some of the negative trades. If you are interested in the settings I used just let me know. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Great. Pls share set Thanks

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Bill, The settings I used were on EurUsd H1 and were as follows Stoploss 125 Trailing stop When to trail 125 Trail amount 75 All other settings were at default. Still testing different combos. So far this is the best settings. The real test will be forward testing on demo.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Bill, Also these settings on EurUsd Daily produced 1.92 profit factor with 53% winning trades. stoploss 200 When to trail 100 Trail amount 100 Forgot to mention this was over 3 year timeframe

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I'm not getting any where near those results EURUSD daily TF (1/1/2012 to today) profit factor 0.74 profit trades 31.5% unless the difference is broker time server - mine is GMT 0

--- 帖子 #284 ---
OK excellent. I'll report back

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Dags, My original backtest was on Oanda from 5/15/12 to 5/15/15. I just ran one from 1/1/12 to 5/15/15. Profit factor 1.67 winning trades 50%. This was with your original EA without ADX. I will run on Forex.com and post results.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Dags, On forex.com a got 1.20 profit factor and 46% winning trades. I guess there are going to be differences in brokers thats why I need to do a live test on demo. For your first EA these results, even on backtest are impressive. Hopefully we can get the same results on forward test. Good job!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
using same EA makes a diff lol getting 1.28 Profit factor at 42% on FXCM

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Dags, Yea I tried the one with ADX and it was not as profitable as the original. I played with the settings,timeframes,and stoploss figures and never got a losing backtest. Looks good so far! Will start my live test Sunday.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Dags, Another example. Run it again on forex.com from 1/1/14 to 5/15/15 and got profit factor 3.79 and winning trades 60%

--- 帖子 #290 ---
THanks for your EA. Cant wait to test it. Can you confirm the EA looks for CCI (cannot remember if 1H and 4H are to cross 100 or be over 100 at the time the daily crossed the 100 line) confirmation of CCI on 1H, 4H and Daily?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
This EA waits for close of candle before taking trade, cross must be in up direction for a buy and down direction for a sell, default settings are 100 and -100, the strategy by tcmm is to take trade when the cross occurs (with other confirmations)

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi dags, Thanks for the EA. The EA is not attaching to my chart. I am using MT4 build 765. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance. Roy

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Just make sure EA is in Experts Folder and allow DLL import on the Common Tab

--- 帖子 #294 ---
If I may add, many people see but do not really look. Kindly look carefully at all marking as not good trades. Divergences are clearly present. We get what we see. TCMM doing good job here.

Hi I am Here The CCI System Boy I see a lot of different things here with my System

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Aren't we also looking to see H1 and H4 also either CROSS above 100 or below -100 **OR** be in the 100 or -100 zone as well to make it a safer trade? I need tccm to clarify this for me.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yes, Your right Keep it Simple Please If you look at my last template I have the main Price Actions on the charts Again I use The Forex Radar, that's close to predict where price is going. - S/R - Pivot Points - Divergence - Break Outs, Triangles, Trend lines, Flags. - Candle Patterns - The 1-2-3 Zig Zag on the 5 Minute Charts. EUR/JPY ONLY I watch all of these when the CCI crosses 100 or -100

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Agree on factoring in S/R...and supply/demand zones are useful too. The OP has also mentioned watching out for divergence, and there is clear divergence now as price is approaching the SR flip. CCI breaking 100/-100 along with strong PA indicates strong momentum. See with the 1st arrow how that combination was high probability that price would break through the 1st resistance level. Even with the divergence price could still move up more as Friday's D1 closed relatively strong. Price will likely seek the sell orders waiting near the next supply zone (supdem indicator) before pulling back, but as always it's best to keep a close eye on PA behavior at these levels. Thanks to TCMM for sharing his method.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
NICE!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Sorry tcmm Was trying to write an EA based on your method but looks like it got a little side tracked, so will start a new thread so not to confuse your method. cheers thanks your method

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I tried a EA Its better Manually. Its Daily Time Frame to look Daily

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi tcmm, Thanks for sharing! Here's my first trade after previous CCI cross on EJ. A little different style using position averaging with stop loss and take profit, but basicly the same. Just set and forget. If trades don't get triggered, then I just profit from whatever the market gives me base on the retrace. Total risk is about 0.56% :-) Let's see how this plays out. I'm in for any style that requires minimal screen time . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #309 ---
That's Fine

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Very interesting tcmm....good forum and sound concept. I have always like the cci as momentum indicator....watched the Woodies group prosper using cci in very short futures time frames on a centralized exchange...even to the point where Woodie could trade without candles, using only the cci indicator. I was never that good, instead I prefer larger time frames in the forex market and was happy to see your forum. My question....have you used his indicator or a version of it as additional confluence relative to the entry cci shown on my chart. I would like to hear your take or experience with this indicator. Thanks and keep up the fine work... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Yes Its Great. Always remember the method crosses over 100 or -100 Now the thing about this method is when it shows its crossing over with the current candle you have to make sure that it can cross back to take a loss or you stay in if it crosses back, but if you look back at the EUR/JPY Daily Chart it happens a little but as you can see on the chart when it goes its huge pips most of the time. Daily Chart, Huge Pips, Less time on computer. You can watch the 1 hour EUR/JPY and catch Pips every day, just look at the 1 hour chart back.

TCMM - DO you Sell and wait for Buy ? Or do you also Example buy then price move below 100 then move up again to 100 do you re-enter buy - or you wait for sell -100 hope my chart will help understand what I am trying to ask

--- 帖子 #330 ---
When it crosses over 100 and its made pips I take some lots off, and if it comes over I still watch it sometimes it goes back, but I would close it also. In my demo above I took Half and its crossed back and I am waiting for now. I could of put a stop at break even but didn't.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Could you tell me what indi you are using for the pivots and lines?

As requested.....this is double woodies cci...so you can run the entry cci setting of 6, sort of a prewarning that things may not continue in the direction we were all watching....is held me back from taking the entry yesterday on ej as it was hooking down, even though the 20 cci was above 100 ...it certainly was worth paying attention too...

Hi TCMM, I see you are also long on USDCAD, I have also been in this trade since yesterday from a break of a trendline on H4 chart, also cci above 100, Please watch the key resistance at 1,2380 . I am already up 100pips. I don't think it will retest any support or trendline, we might see a move higher but watching exhaustion levels on H4

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thanks Swede ! but the template does not bring up the CCI Woodies in chart Window 1 do you have another one ? Thank you, pax

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I like this method but on daily seems to miss massive moves. Look at eurusd theres roughly 300 pips missed from the drop yesterday and today. Isnt there a way to pick up that more effectively anyone got any ideas?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Observation - I think we miss some good trade because we wait for the 100+ for buy and -100 to sell -- I see equally or better trade if sell +100 and buy -100

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Tccm, I really like the method but my candles don't work, is thee some other setting in MT4 you need to change??

--- 帖子 #349 ---
The method used here is catching the start of big momentum moves....often reflected by the +- 100. There are other ways to trade cci such as ZLR (zero line reject) or hook from extreme, but that is now what is being practiced in this particular method....have a read on this clip about cci...

--- 帖子 #350 ---
should have read "NOT" being practiced in this method

--- 帖子 #351 ---
It looks interesting Zaman! Can you share you template and Indicators here?

Wonderful !

To believe, we have to practice and do it manually and check past charts and also see it live for all time frames. Then focus on your choice of time frame to trade. By doing it yourself, you will get more confidence. Knowing it personally that it works is very crucial for trading any method for that matter. Happy making money to all. Cheers!

Hi Swede, Thanks a lot for posting the indicator I requested. Happy Trading Roy

Right if you trade Below 100 and above -100 you will have lots of whipsaws and the trends are smaller if you get them. But ,my CCI Method is Great to trade over 100 and below -100. Great on EUR/JPY and Big Huge Pips on a Daily Charts. Now you can sit in front on computer on a EUR/JPY 1 Hour chart From the Euro Session on, and grab 20 or 30 pips or more a day if you like, but I like Daily Less trades Huge Pips!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Fair enough - I like the simplicity of not have to look at charts constantly (15min 30min 1hr 4hr) I like trading off the daily chart. I scroll back on the daily ej chart buy -100 cross and sell 100 cross - is equal the same as 100 buy and sell -100 Anyways let go with your way. My big question how to you handle show a big drop - you take loss and wait - or you ride it out - or you have sl in place See attached

--- 帖子 #357 ---
NO its not Equal the same way You make more pips and big trends over and under period!! I have done this for a long time. Any way I ride it out about 50 pips. If I am out and it goes over I go back in. Look back at the EUR/JPY Daily and see how big those over 100 and -100 Trends and Pips where!!!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Did anybody see the Buy on the USD/CAD I already took Half. Stop loss at break even If it keeps going I will take more lots

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I just hooked up the EJ chart using the rules you set out. From the 16th-28th april most of the start of the move was missed on daily we are talking 400 pips. Is there no tweaks to the CCI we can make to get a little more of this?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
There is no indicator which shows good entry points. For me all indicators are useless..

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Zamanib, do you mind sharing your template and indicators? Thanks in advanced!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I agree partially....but there are times indicators can keep you from making mistakes...like the double cci Woodies on EJ in the last 24 hours. I have been trading for over 15 years and of all the indicators I have tried, and believe me I have tried many, I have found cci and adx to have the most merit as momentum indicators, but they are not make the final decision for me....they just give me an idea of the strength of a move. That has got to count for something imho.

HELLO TCMM, The signal arrow does not appear on my chart after applying your updated template. What can i do to this please? Thanks in advance.

Yes this indicator appears if it crosses, on the same candle, not on the next open try it on a 5 minute chart you will see it appear on the candle it crosses

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Ok All You Great Traders. I think From All Traders World Wide I am Going to show you something that no one sees about the CCI and what it does on a 1 hour chart, when the trading is quiet after US Session closes, till mostly to EURO Open. Which is now. What I want you to do is on these currencies, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, And AUD/USD, Open 1 hour Charts. Put the CCI 20, Apply 6 Setting like we do already, and tell me where the CCI values are right now on all these Currencies. You we be Surprise. It happens all time, because when the markets start to move i.e: EURO START It breaks away from this pocket and you can trade the 1 hours and make pips, but you have to be on the computer watching it. But on the EUR/JPY Daily That I trade which I like Because it makes good trends and good pips. But again you can trade 1 hour, but if you look on those 5 currencies, now you Can't Trade. Go a head look.

Good Tcmm Anyone who has an answer to the following can answer please. The arrow on kingspips indicator, does it appear at a close of the candle where it is or at an opening of that candle?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Depends on what defines your trend and after that don't go against it. I use the Heiken Ashi Smoothed or a 20 EMA as my line in the sand for trend changes. Keeps me right much of the time. Plus CCI is catching the reversals after consolidations and such. I've since closed the EJ trade as it went back under.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Download and re-install all the indicators. Reset the platform and apply the template. Be sure to get the updated kingpips indicator. All works well for me... GL

Yes I use the robot for other settings and had 2 trades active and manually added those I seen with this system on 1hr. Made good on a basket during high momentum, but, no, slots did not take those trades. The plugin waits for bar closes after cross and that is not the way here.

FYI TRO indicators. For the Candle time heat map If use.close is TRUE (DEFAULT) then previous close is used in the calculations. If use.close is FALSE then previous midpoint is used in the calculations. If price is below the previous midpoint then SELLERS are in control. If price is above the previous midpoint then BUYERS are in control. The HEAT should reflect this. For CAN (candle color meter) Enter once 1hr and daily has the same color Training wheels tells you to trade or wait. It's based on the candle color meter 1hr and daily color match.

Hello Ellenbrook, Can you please share your own set of indicators?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
My self I go in because in this method on a daily chart you can catch the big pips most of the time. If you look back on that Daily GBP/CHF when it crosses it goes, if you have sometimes when it crosses back it for a loss its ok, if again it crosses over I go back in for those big pips on a daily, because this CCI Method is powerful . Once it has made Huge pips it Diverges all the time its amazing.

Are you sure you have the indicator installed? Sometime you may apply a template and did not have all the indicators you can get this type of activity. Make sure you have training wheels installed.

remove cci indicator and the install it again and it will now be at the very bottom. Remember to set it at 20 FFCAL will now cover a bit of the MACD which is just a quick visual confirmation so...

What I am showing is I don't trade like this. 1 Hour charts, and different currencies, you can if you like. I Trade EUR/JPY Daily Chart even if I have wait Days for the signal crosses. Simple, once a day, with new candle open, when you have trend pickup Pips are huge. If you like 1 or 4 hour Signals and different currencies, Trade them. I am staying EUR/JPY Daily Like I have been before this Thread. From now on I will only show this in the thread here to. I traded other currencies and 1 and 4 hour charts, to show who wants to do it.

I wanted to suggest posting of possible setups moving forward without adding all sorts of indicators. We need to prove the initial strategy over a period of time before adding other things.

Can see what you mean,,,,didn't take long for all manner of indicators and other methods to start creeping in..not that there is anything wrong with that lol but here is the thing..I truly believe, after over 15 years of trading, we do the best when we focus on one or maybe two currencies at the most. I know someone who only trades gbp/jpy....another eur/usd and I only wish I had their bank accounts. So, for my long term trading perspective, I am going to do the same as you and concentrate on only the one cross currency and see how it does over the long haul......thank you for the great method.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi tcmm. Thanks for a nice cci system :-) Can I ask about the lot sizes on your trade explorer, why is some of the orders opened with 2.0 lots and other trades 0.1 lots? The open trades is at +78pips but -0.4% in return.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Guys How do u ppl set TP and stop loss on daily time frames Regards

--- 帖子 #446 ---
This system looks pretty good I've loaded it onto my MT4 and I reckon it will do well. I'm a big fan of trading the D1. I did change the arrow with my own indicator which you can download below. Have a great week traders...

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Default setting? Also, why do you prefer your arrow? Thanks

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Thanks for sharing. So far the pips have been great to the eyes.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Can't believe I didn't know about CCI Candles indicator before. It's really proving to be exceptionally helpful. After sustaining a loss last year (granted I'm a newbie), I had the idea to review my trades using this indicator now and it's mind-blowing. I was getting in during range bound trades, buying high and selling low, selling low and buying high -- aye carumba!! I was often caught at wits end how so many of my trades were so poor and how 90% of my winners I had were eked out gains of a few pips here and there, scalps that got me out before the major trend in the opposite direction took over. This is quite a revelation. And had brushed off D1 trading but now see how thoroughly useful and important this TF is.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Seems we all come to the same realization about daily charts after a few years in the trenches..he he

--- 帖子 #451 ---
It is superb if someone create a dashboard to alert which pairs have signal of this system, the dashboard allows trader to choose many different timeframe.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
On a daily time frame from rule of SL its 100 Pips. TP you can take Lots off along the way on a Daily Trend and bring your stop to break even. Or in the case of this CCI method if it makes good amount of pips you can wait for the CCI line Value to come back over the 100 or -100, because it Diverges away from price.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I change around a bit with the lots

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Believe me guys the daily time frame is good. Sometimes like all of us we tried different ways to trade. But I come back to Daily. You need to learn and wait to trade on a daily chart. You get your losses Lets says 20%, but the winners in this Daily CCI method are huge pips. Also it makes you be on the computer less. I have been up long during nights, just like some of you.

Hi, I dont have any intention to hijack this great thread but I would like to show my chart which is very much in line with what big brother tcmm says albeit with some little alterations.The idea here is to just add less analysis other than what the indicators say. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The red and green at the bottom chart is H4 MTF CCI. One can use this to find the turning points of the Daily candles. The candles are again CCI candles of the current time frame (15 minutes). In order to take the turning points one have to wait for the green color change and the price has to be above the daily open line (if BUY). Now for subsequent entries look for end of Red candles and good entries are below daily open line. we are basically looking for lower prices of over sold areas in the current time frame. Also if the price is below Daily Open Line all are looking for Selling but You and our CCI will take you for subsequent Buying and soon you will see price move fiercely breaking above the Daily Open Line. This pattern is repeated over and over again because Robber Banks always try to bring prices lower and trap all retails traders who Sold. Hope I am making some sense here and Brother tcmm does not have any objection of me posting this. Wish you all good luck.

Hello tcmm! Just to understand your system correct, there was a CCI short signal in the EURUSD D1 at something like 12 hours ago.The H4 CCi was already under -100 but H1 still above.Later today the H1 went also under the -100 line but just a short time. So as all 3 CCIs were under the -100 the signal was triggered? Even the H4 CCI was at this time on the way back up? Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Hi tcmm, Just noticed you closed the USDCHF trade. Was the close because H1 and H4 were no longer green? Or was it that there was no breakout of the Demark trendline? Also, can you explain how you use radar signal indicator? Thanks Jim

Pannet, Thanks for sharing. Looks very interesting. How long have you been trading this and with what success? Can you share your template? Thank you! Sir Wolf

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi sirwolf, Not for long. Just started recently. My equity is finally making a (big) U turn, which is primarily due to Money Management, so the trading system does not matter. Sorry template will not work for you because I am using sub folders for storing CCI indicators. But these are very simple ones and nothing complicated. May be some may not have the Daily Open Line.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Tcmm. Yes I agree with all you said about Tallinex. Good brokers. Thats the brokers I use uptil now. But I disagree with you on one issue and that is in news trading. You see I got this great straddle EA for news trading which I went to a great cost to procedure. Because of what I have heard about Tallinex concerning News trading I called them and they reassured me. I opened an account with them. In demo I instantly became a millionaire, But when I went live, they allowed a few trades which made great profits and tripled my account. They decided to set a software against me and made sure they ruined the account. If brokers were to allow me to use this simple straddle EA with my special settings, my story would have been very very different.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
OK, I just Mention News Trading I do Not Advise You To Trade News I did It for I while, its very hard thing to do.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
sirwolf, Long Story Short. This is just the standard CCI indicator on the higher timeframe. But CCI indicator just moving up and down does not give me confidence. On the left is the H4 (higher timeframe chart). Problem with higher timeframe candles when traded directly are when we enter after the candle close, we are late in the trend and when we enter at the candle open we are in the retrace. So we just use it for the Bias and use the Daily Open Line for timing. Once we are in the Bias, we look for counter trend to reach high or low to enter for smaller profits. This will also keep the impatient busy. The chart on the right is 15 minutes, You can see on the Sell Bias, Selling at the highs (or end of Green Candles) produced winners.

I have been in the EUR/JPY from May 22 To sell. It has reached about 71 Pips over the -100, now because the value is now -125 and I am about 40 pips in profit. I put a stop loss at break even because, of the little pips in profit. If I was lets say 100 pips in profit I would not put a stop loss because of the Divergence it always does I would wait till it crosses back above the -100 value and still be in profit without a SL. I have taken out Profits along the way. I had started at $20 a pip and removed $15 a pip out, now I am left with $5 a pip. Do You Get The Idea. If you Look above at my trading you see the EUR/JPY, Don't worry about the AUD/USD, its extra, I don't trade other currencies, I just trade EUR/JPY I do it in this thread for learning But You can if you want. Let me tell you something, if you like trading and don't want to wait for a Daily CCI Signal, you can still trade the EUR/JPY 1 hour and 4 Hour, and just stick with Eur/jpy currency . Also the EUR/JPY almost trades 24 Hours Except after EURO Close it slows down till JAPAN OPEN which is about 7 hours there its slow and you should not trade in that 7 hour zone because of whip saws!!! OK Got This Info. Its Great!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
One quick question: trading on 1H and 4H, do you keep the same settings in the CCI CustomCandles indicator i.e. CCI period 20, CCI price 6 etc) or you change them? Thank you.

Yes You Can keep the same settings. You can try 14, 6 But always keep 20, 6, On Daily

Hi. Thanks for the thread tcmm, it got me looking at CCI again. I do have a request from any coders out there to help with the Woodies CCI in post 313 and post 335. The creator added a LWMA line at zero, shows up as green positive and red negative. I really like this feature but it does not update automatically. Have to refresh the indicator to get it to update. Could one of the kind people out there take a look and see if it can be made to update automatically. Thanks again for the thread tcmm, and thanks to anyone that can alter the Woodies CCI. mdavem.

Look At the EUR/JPY I sold At May 22 at 133.84 When it crossed over-100. I took Lots out Along the way. Now I have $5 A Pip Left With Stop At Break Even. Now If It Makes A lot Of Pips From Here Its At 133.20 about Now, The CCI Line Will Reach A point that it will Divert Back and I can take the Stop loss out and wait for it to cross Above the -100 and close the trade. While The Candles Are Still Up.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi Fendi, Sorry at this stage I cannot or do not know how to download a copy of the screen to show you but the srategy is pretty simple and you can start when either a blue arrow to buy or a yellow arrow to sell.eg Buy signal (a trade is placed) the TP happens when a Sell signal shows.The Sell signal is also the start of the new trade. Sell signal (a trade is placed) the TP happens when a Buy signal shows.The Buy signal is also the start of the new trade. Sometimes it may take 5 days before a new signal to close one trade and open another but at this stage it never loses. I would like to think because of this forum we may have a winner in our midst and I do believe it will win on every major currency pair. Cheers !!!

Hello! I think the CCI Value varys from broker to broker if they have different brokertimes. I checked the EURJPY D1 chart with CCI 20 at 5 Demoaccounts. Brokers with same brokertime do have the same CCI Value. Others differ quite a lot.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
So now you wait for cci to go under -100 or above 100 and for the signal arrow to show before you take a trade?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Not the issue in this case the. CCI 20 on daily is just meeting -100 today . Nowhere near on the 22nd. The deviations are not that wild across different brokers. Also early today CCI crossed the -100 on EJ and pulled back.

sorento hi! nice trade!. Is your TP and SL at 1:1? or do you use tcmm style of taking profits along the way? How do you manage those fake crosses? Many many thanks!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
======= BillYon, Admittedly I am very late and someone may have already answered your question, but consider that we have 22 trading days in a month then you should actually select 22. The difference between 20 &amp; 22 is minimal on such a TF anyway. I suggest you test the 2 settings below each other.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Agreed. I have since after some testing, settled at 21. Running baskets as such with slots. Also a 20 and 15 EMA splitting the troops with the groovy indy. Doing quite well

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Tcmm, I did not know if you could share how you do money management and when you take profits along the way? Do you take 3 postions of 2% when you initially begin a trade? Jim

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I'm sorry, can you explain how to use cavemanager with this system? thanks

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Ok, I'll bite - how did you get 22? When I started reading your post I thought you were going to say 20. I had thought 20 when reading BillYon's question, but as I only read it yesterday, I didn't reply. I guess it could depend on the broker, but I only get 5 daily candles in a week.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi find some success with Range bar 25pips on the cci cross +100 buy -100 sell Also I notice if cci +100 cross if coming from below zero line towards the +100 its good buy (vice-versa for -100) But if coming from above zero line toward +100 not good buy - I don't take those trades (vice-versa for -100) See attached chart -

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I know this thread is about the +100 -100 cross and I don't want to disrupt that. It is a system that works. For those of you that are looking for a bit more flexibility while trading you may want to consider changing the parameters a little bit. If one looks closely the +100/-100 level could be a bit tighter and get you in the trade a few candles earlier - anywhere between 0 and +100/-100. All I am saying is while the +100/-100 is safe, you can also trade this setup more aggressively between zero and +100/-100; say +50/-50 as an example. In other words, there is nothing magical about +100/-100. In CCI below zero signals down/sell zone and CCI above zero signals up/buy zone.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
===== Hi AUD, Other than February the months run into 30 days and 31 days as you know and on average you will find that we have 22 trading days per month over a calendar year. Continued success to you.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
====== Bill, .........."running baskets as such slots" went over my head. Kindly either explain or show me a pic of what you mean plse? I take it that by referring to "groovy indy" you mean the CCi ? Best wishes and continued success.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
It Ranges More between below 100 and above -100. You will get more losses. Look at a EUR/JPY 1 hour chart and if you look closely when markets are quiet like now till Euro Session the CCI goes in that Range below 100 and above -100. So with that in mind when the markets are moving you can trade the over 100 and Below -100, trends are strong at those levels. Please under stand this.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
hi Tcmm i have one question for you.when we do trade on daily chart, for confirmation you suggest us to check CCI on 1H and 4H too.can you tell us where the CCI should be in those charts(!h and 4H)? if its buy signal, then CCI in 1H and 4H should be over 100 or between 0 and 100? thanks fred

--- 帖子 #536 ---
They have to be over 100 and -100 Not between 0 and 100 or 0 and -100 If the daily candle is going over, when it opens on that day, you can check the 1 hour CCI to see if its over, or between 100 and -100 you don't have to go in, and you can also wait till the markets open ie: Euro open.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Why did you take the GBP/USD short? CCI is nowhere near -100, at least with my broker.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi all! I just made an Indicator which give you a signal only if D1,H4 and H1 is above 100 or under -100. With email and audible alert. I think its easier this way than wait for the confirmation of H4 and H1. check it out.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Zamanib, how (what indicator do you use) and why (it's a long term system) you use M3 charts?! no surprise your range from -100 to 100 is only 25pips.

Hi tcmm, those are the trades I took after the market opened. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A few hours back, the CCI yellow line had crossed 100 and the green little arrow appeared, so I go for long, but now it is not as good as i see. What do you think? Should I wait or close it? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same goes to this, CCI yellow crossed 100 and then it juss turn right back. I really have no ideas should I wait or close, please enlighten me tcmm. Thank you very much.

Hello mickael! Attached is the same indicator modified. Buy Signal when D1,H4 and H1 above CCI 100. Sell Signal when D1,H4 and H1 below CCI -100. Exit long Signal when D1 crosses CCI 100 from above. Exit short Signal when D1 crosses CCI -100 from below. Like tcmms thread rules. All with Email and Audible Alert. The arrows are not correct, but at the alarms are ok. If you set all 4 colours the same than your background they will disappear. Hope this helps.

Just an idea regarding MultiPair CCi-20 where one could see immediately which currency is ready for the picking. Ideally I would like to have a cluster with more than what I am showing you here, but that will take some coding which I am not qualified to do. Would love to hear your comments tcmm. Continued success to you all.

Hi Mary. If you seek a good broker I would recommend Global Prime. They are in Australia. Check out their rating on Forex Peace Army, FPA

Global prime does not take US citizens.

gandhi0815 hello, could you please fix also arrows? the graph is very confusing

Though am not a daily chart trader, but i hope i can learn one or two things to add to my trading style. Its been a while, coming back to forex after a long break.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
One can easily check and see that it does not work this way. Of the past ten signals 8 would have been closed for a loss (not a profit) one would have been a small gain or BE, and the latest signal would be a substantial gain if closed now, can't tell what will happen if we wait for the next signal. This was reading from a Daily chart. Only wish it would work like rammer indicates.

Dear friends, I have been reading a lot written in this thread and saw people adding so many indicators and ruining a simple strategy, not in a bad way guys. I appreciate everything from everyone posting. TCMM your strategy works for small part and can make you miss some good trades. For example look at the possible entries when cci comes from below -100 and passing 0 for buy and coming from 100 and passing 0 for a sell. Don't get me wrong I am here to help and add what I can with permission. To give a glimpse I will post some missed trades in the EURJPY, I like things simple. First let us look at the daily chart EURJPY.Daily.png From the 27/05/2015 this was up and made 254 pips on daily chart. Look at the next picture now with CCi it is no where near 100 when entered, I use CCi 14 EURJPY.Daily 2.png But if you trade 4H don't worry you would have been able to make several entries too and collect on all see below EURJPY.H4.png What I like about this strategy is if you are a scalper you can also use it on 1hr taking small targets say of 5 pips 3-5 times a day EURJPY.H1.png This works on all pairs like GBPNZD made 219pips yesterday GBPNZD.Daily.png Alternatively if there is anyone willing to start a new thread where we focus on this strategy, I will gladly contribute. Yes price action is the best and this so far to me is as close you can get to price action. All the best

My apologies Mary and thanks for letting me know Billyon Good pips to you Sir and to all of you Personally if i wanted to trade forex from the States, I think i'de emigrate

Interesting strategy thanks to everyone who share in this wonderful thread Personally, I've been using this indicator for a while ( Cynthia i trend ), featured with signal alerts. I'm planning to "merge" this indicator into this strategy to filter trends and improve profit probabilities I hope you find it useful for you as well Wish you all the best

I agree

Hello mickael! I would like to change them,but actually i am not a coder. Made this indi with eabuilder. Arrows are not working well but alarms working perfect ,which is the most important thing. I made the arrows unvisible in this attachments. Have been trying many different settings ,but we need a real coder. Maybe someone can fix it.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Have been hi-jacked away from the thread, thanks to TCMM for the info and keep doing what you doing, from time to time I will visit, as the token of my appreciation here is possible setup for the coming week. All the best EURUSD.Daily.png Wait for the retest of the 1,10 area and look for out for a bearish setup with the first target at 1.0850-1,0839 followed by 1,0714 and finally 1,0549 Have a great trading week NB. CCi WORKS FRIEND ONCE YOU GET TO UNDERSTAND ALL OPTIONS FOR ENTRIES, TAKE A LOOK AT ENTRIES WHEN IT COMES FROM OVERSOLD (BELOW -100) AND CROSSES 0 LEVEL AND WITH CHERRY ON TOP WHEN IT ALSO CROSSES +100 (FROM BELOW -TO- (-100) - TO -(0)-TO - (+100) ) THAT IS FOR A BUY AND OPPOSITE FOR A SELL. TIME FRAME IS NOTHING LESS THAN 4H HAPPY TRADING AND KEEP IT SIMPLE AND DONT FORGET WITH WHATEVER STRATEGY WATCH KEY LEVEL OR ELSE YOU WILL SELL ON TOP OF SUPPORT LEVEL OR BUY JUST BELOW KEY RESISTANCE LEAVING NO ROOM TO COLLECT. MOST IMPORTANT DONT CHASE THE MARKET LET IT COME TO YOU

EURJPY where to from here, don't rush into it yet until it breaks 136,55 area and look for bullish evidence, I would prefer for a retest of 136,55 before entering the break of that level, for those thinking of taking a break of cci +100 level be careful you will be buying at key level just (not enough room) like the last Mondays sell at key support that did not go anywhere. Once we break that level we clear for 137,95 area For those that love Gold, wait for the bullish evidence above 1180, look how it has been caught in those highlighted areas, can you see how it wants to cross below -100 that will be great for that move higher, so lets hope a move to test that 1180 line will move cci below -100 and bullish evidence to follow to take us to 1224 area. I wish I had time for the rest of other pairs,

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Friends Before I disappear for good I will keep helping where I can, First look at that EURJPY at that level I mentioned, moving ahead the one of the pairs that is interesting for this month and you can use it when doing your cci analysis during this month of june is GBPCAD: Look at how the time frames connect together and monthly chart gave a signal, with daily chart retraced nicely last week to test support and lets hope we will get that bullish evidence at daily close, I believe this month we might see this pair moving up by another 500 pips. That is my take What do you think? This is just to help you with those signals that you will look at when using your cci method MY APOLOGIES NO TEMPLATE UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

Do you mind at least telling us what are your MA settings and possibly sharing your arrow indicator? Thank you.

What a shame...he started this thread seeming genuinely focused on sharing his CCI method with everyone,,,but now FF has deemed it necessary to move him to the commercial forums. His new thread thread is now totally focused on another agenda signing up new accounts with a certain broker. Good looking out FF

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Yes, I was thinking the same thing, but the "system" was already described. Not too sure I would wait for over or under 100 myself, but I like the visuals and indicators.

Hi Dags, hope all is well. Mate I was wondering how the ea that you wrote regarding CCI Non-Lagging System is going. I have been trading the system manually for over a month now and have had great results. Your onto something good here and i believe that weith a bit of tweaking it could turn out to be a real earner. Unfortunately I do not have any coding skills but would be more than happy to bounce some ideas. I am in Melbourne. Where are you located? Regards George.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
On which time frame are you using the EA..h1 or d1?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
If you are refering to the CCI EA (dags) i believe he is using it on HR1

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Im refering at Dashboard Ultimate

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Sorry to sound a bit Dim or Thick as they call it in Yorkshire,,, but is the dashboard just an indicator and when you get most time frames going in one direction you follow it ? or is it an automated system trading for you.. ? I am stuck at work all day and can only look at charts from around 5:30 till 7:00am and then evenings .. until I fall asleep.. so I need some help .

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Powermania, I take the CCI reading on the daily. When candle direction , CCI &amp; RSI are same color place trade in that direction . Clicking on the pair button on the left will open the chart to that pair (set up that chart however you like and name it "DASH" MTPockets

--- 帖子 #598 ---
pgburty, The Dasboard can be used manually, semi-auto or full Auto. The particular thread which the Ultimate Dashboard is in has about 10 Dashboards (lower TF, Daily TF traders and a couple for long term trades (by Ding Dong). None of the Dashboards have a PDF of how to use as they are a work in progress. The first Dashboard at the beginning of the thread is actually the simplest one to use, very basic. Read the first 2 pages and you'll have all the information you need to trade that one. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=532236 The original Dash is in Post #4 PS... Forgot to mention., but you probably already know this. Full auto is best used 1 hour before LO until 1 hour after LO (close Basket ) ... NY -- 45 minutes before NY open, close Basket 45 minutes after NY open up to London close (depending on Red News). MTPockets

Hi! Please, BillYon: Can you post Indicators and Template from the second Picture from this post? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...55#post8308755 Thank you so much!!!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
alpv, Am I to understand from you comments , that at when it crosses upwards from -100 you buy, and cross downwards from +100 you sell ???????????. I can understand why you stated at the end as follows YOUR QUOTE """ Still, this setup contains a lot of mishaps of different nature. As a result it's a very likely to get unexpected sharp losses UNQUOTE. From the gist of what you are describing I can understand your losses. Why do you not consult KINGPIPS, and get on the right track with your trading, and avoid all those EXPECTED losses you are having.!!!

--- 帖子 #608 ---
This indicator is great, tcmm, as your thread Can anybody now, please, add a CCI indicator that also alerts (sound and message) when the CCI goes again into the non-entry zone (from 100 to -100)? So just ONE indicator that says ENTER (just 1 Day or the time frame of the chart) and EXIT (just 1 Day or the time frame of the chart). By the way, I have installed several indicators and there is one -I do not know which one- that sends a message saying "Stealth Buy Trade Soon" but when the trend is already a strong BUY and CCI is already above 100 since several candles ago. Anybody know about that indicator and the meaning of the message? Thanks and all the best!

--- 帖子 #609 ---
[quote=tcmm;8275296]{quote} What I am showing is I don't trade like this. Now, one question about your trading style, tccm: Let us imagine that you have got enough pips and you want to close. Once you close, the price retraces, but continues above the 100 and with direction up, do you enter again or you wait for a different day/candle? Thanks and all the best! Jos

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Hi Billyon: Could do you please tell, when started your trades and when was finished? I mean how long time it took from the start to close your trades? and what about the high impacts news did you close your trades under the red news? Thank you for your reply

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Will any trader, PLEASE, share the CCI indicator used to be alerted when the 100 and -100 levels are crossed, being able to change the parameters of I use for entering the "kingspip01" indicator but this one does not alert about the exit (cross again of 100 and -100). Thanks in advance. All the best José
