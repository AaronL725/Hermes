I have had a lot of people email

saying they can only trade once a day what is the best system

the old 200 ema system in a great one

you use only a the 200 that is it for tools

you look for the trend to be broken

I start with the month & just move down

two the same way with the 3rd one the wronge way

I am looking to get in

4 hour 1 hour 15 is the main one I use

can use any three

1st target hit

closed 1/2 my trade

move up Sl to 0 +1 on the 2nd 1/2

--- 帖子 #5 ---
pretty slick. how often do you find setups on that?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
all the time esp. when I am too busy to do any other system.

The 200 ema is the best single tool in any trading system.

its the bull/bear line in the sand

and is used by the most traders of any tool

also when price crosses it, on any time frame

you will see the jet power hit....and price aften takes off.

esp. if its cutting back into the higher trend

TEB

good to know. i will check it out as i am often short for time. thanks. which of your systems are you using most often these days?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
teb2

But you know it really don't matter the point is mtf trading

3 or 4 tf & good MM

& a trader is good to go

kiss is the best way to go ....

simple simple

a tool

a trend

a trigger

a target

thats it

Where is the edge with this system?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
what do you mean?

teb

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I mean, what is the reason to enter the trade.  There is nothing stopping this strategy from losing 50 times in a row...

Contrary to popular belief, MAs are not "magnets" for price....  half of the time the price is the magnet to the MA...

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I would say 100% of the times prices are magnetes to MAs...

MAs like any other indicator are price derivatives.  Very simple.

If you learn how to understand price behavior, you are quicker than anyone else using indicators.

I laugh so much when I hear traders say they've found this cool indicator or combination of indicators that are price leading instead of price lagging.

That totally shows why most of traders lose at this game.

The above is not meant to criticize the strategy described in this thread.  There surely are good strategies based on indicators, so whatever work best for us we should use it.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
it is simply moving with the higher trend..

you are buying in the dips  & sell into rallies.

I would say MAs do have power because people use them

& the granddad of all the MA is the 200 emas

this MA DOES have power.

but this systems strenght is the high & lows (or TL break)

the 200 ema just shows the trend

of 3 TFs

you will not have a lot of trade

but I believe it likely will be the high % of any system of wins

but you need MM

TEB

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I agree with you- all tools are baced on MAs

that is why when I see 5 tools on a chart

- I know the person really don't understand what tools do

... all the tools really say the same thing ...really

what you see often is someone using two tools to show diff TF

ie Stoch 5.3.3  & a RSI 14

a stoch 14.3.3 & a RSI 14 say the samething

you will basically get the same buy sell signs

the strenght of a tool, is it is easier & quicker to read one tool on 3 TF

then to really read PA on 3 charts.

TEB

--- 帖子 #15 ---
TEB63,

are You still using 3 ducks?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
yes.. this system is a great team with that system I think

both are slow price over MAs on 3 tf

but they are opp. to each other

60sma is a break out system with the trend

200ema is a retrend system back into the trend

I didn't take this trade I had other trades on

but it is book trade - to trade a free trade

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Target 1 got taken out (1st blue circle)

would have got about 35 pips

I would close 1/2 or 1/3 of my trade .

move the stop lose up to 0+1 on what ever else I have (red line)

so the rest of the trade is now free

then price dropped down & takes out takes out SL

(its friday so maybe a good sign this pair is going to go up)

thanks for sharing,how do u work out the target levels

TEB,

Sorry if my previous posts sounded negative....

thanks for sharing your observations....  they have some merit.

hi TEB

I just can't work out how you decide where to put your % levels.  I can see that it works, but it changes all the time.  Sometimes you use the previous reaction low and high, but for instance on the UERUSD you posted it is not the case.  I would appreciate it if you would explain.

thanx

oh the basic system .. works great too:

just looking for conformations

but you don't need to ...

the system works great with just breaks

but the conformation may speak to a big move

teb

--- 帖子 #24 ---
That's exatly what i was thinking, what's the method to this madness so to speak, how do you draw those % levels, how do you decide when and where to put them? Some explanation behind the reasoning would be nice..

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I am not sure what the problem where is?

please tell what you are missing?

okay in an up trend

We know its an up trend because

price is over the 200ema on the 2 higher charts ... right?

we move to the 3rd chart the lowest time frame

price will be under the 200ema- bucking the trend

& so we are only looking to go long (up)

so we find the last swing low that becomes our 0%

we then find the last swing high that becomes the 100%

if you are looking at a TL break again it will have to be to the upside(long)

in a down trend all is opp

That is as easy as I can make it

other questions ask ?

hope that helps

Teb,

In regards to a question I've asked twice a while back on another thread (http://forexfactory.com/showthread.p...91#post1750091), where can we go to see your teb2 system? What is the link to that thread?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I see very little here related to PA around the 200 MA. I see fibs, I seetrendlines, I see mention of price targets (based on what ?). I see nothing to do with how entries are determined other than being around the "single most important tool" 200 ma which is purely opinion.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
TEB63: In your previous post I quote you "I never called it 200 ema system" yet in post #1 of this thread of yours' you say "the old 200 ema system is a great one"! I've looked at all your threads and for the best part they consist of unintelligible garbage. If your methods are successful for you then you are truly gifted, it's a pity you are incapable of conveying your systems to others. I wonder why you bother posting such stuff, the only consistent thing about your methods is your complete inability to answer the most basic questions about what you do.Eventually the thread dies as will this one.

If you click on Tebs avatar you will get a list of his posts and threads.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Take it easy my friend.  Yes sometimes it can be a touch difficult to understand what he's actually trying to convey, but  I respect TEB for his efforts.  He has to be commended for that.

Whether his systems work or not is a different matter, but the only way to find out is for people to try it for themselves.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks dracyco, but the problem is he has over 1400 posts. That is why I've asked Teb himself of where the thread is.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello,

I remember saying that dozens of times to myself in the eighth grade because Mrs. Marshall wouldn't answer my questions like I wanted. She would give me about half of what I needed for a satisfactory answer. Damnest thing,I had to find the rest of the answer by myself. As I remember I got A's in her class Just To Show Her. I hated her for years. I know she must feel out of place in the world of instant gratification the internet has brought, hell we can't even add 3 columns of 3 digits. Who needs to we have calculators for that.

Teb don't stop posting just cause you piss me off sometimes. Keep that mind churning out ideas. They are usually simple and straight forward when I do finally have the lightbulb moment and thats how I like things (K.I.S.S.).

Learn to control the head games we play with ourselves, actually stay with a strict money management regimen, and take any one of Teb's systems as a framework for Your method and..... well you could do a lot worse. Teb is an idea man. Idea men don't often give us any glimse into their worlds. Just throw us a bone once in a while Teb.

Thanks,

Roy

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I believe TEB explained in his post 25 the exact criteria for entries stops and exits as shown on his MTF charts.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
And I believe edge has hit the nail right on the head. There is very little here whether we go back to class or not.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I am sorry I must be a little slow

but it seems very simple to me..

& it is a very simple system 200ema & 1.2.3 break/ thats it

in an uptend

0% - the swing low is the stop loss (I would put it 2 pips below)

100% in the enter ( again I would do 2 pips over)

200% 300% & 400% are the targets - exits ( again I would do 2 pips below)

the 200 emas on the 3 charts give trend & PA

it seems very simple to me

rather then "YELLING AT ME"

tell me your question because I still do not know what it is

teb

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I am just wondering does this make sence

to anyone else or is harder then I think ..

Hi Teb,

Hope you're having a great day! You mentioned on your 1st post that you mainly trade the 4HR , 1HR , & 15MN time frames. You haven't posted any charts of those time frames for your 200 EMA system, so do you now prefer the higher Time Frames? Thanks for taking the time to read my question!!.....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Now I have an idea of your "system". Unless you explained more in other threads, uptil now much of what you posted in this thread was charts with fib retracements and circles.

Maybe now you could point out where the "yelling at me" part was. Or not.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
good question

it was such a crazy week last week, I was only going with higher time frames. I didn't trust the lower  ones.

I did some back testing & I believe week, day, 4 hours

may be the best with this system.

teb

--- 帖子 #42 ---
It's because of his simple multitimeframe stochastics system TEB1, and then TEB2, I finally understood the importance of synchronizing multiple timeframes and now use this concept in my strategy, which increased my success rate. So, in my eyes, you calling his stuff "unintelligible garbage" only demonstrate your own level of intellect. What's not to understand here? Spead fibs on the latest swing only backwards, it works for him, great, he shows it to others, what is your problem?

You've shared great stuff TEB, please don't stop posting. Thank  you.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I am so interesting to see such effective system.

Would you tellme how to scalp GBP/JPY using M5 etc to get better profits?

ELE

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi I'm BWR and I approve of this system,  What is there not to understand?

Is it too simple for some people to understand?  I would have to say yes.  Does he need to write a book about it to explain it? No. Go get some common sense.  Its all about trading with the trend here.

Why is the 200ema so powerful?  Its on almost every traders screens in all the major banks.  And if those traders are watching it then obviously is has some clout as they are the market makers, just look at past pa and you will see how many times price respects the 200.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
So I have marked off most of the major turning points on the GU daily chart with 200 xma and what do I see: point D a reversal up (very good) point F a consolidation (good) point G a reversal down (very good). But if it is so powerful and such a magnet why is it possible for price to get so far away from it at points B, C , E AND H. What good does a 200 XMA do in predicting those swing points - nothing.

And is it not possible to draw other XMA lengths and see similar reversals and consolidations upon their plots. Absolutely.

This chart covering a year had 3 possible trades. Now I know you can look at more than one market and look at lower timeframes but is just seems to me to be very limiting to what the overall trend is doing.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Any moving average will appear to be a magnet for price, because you will see price oscillate around it. It's not because traders universally recognize it. It's because a MA is a running average of price and price acts as a magnet to the MA.

That isn't to downgrade this system.

I don't know if it will work or not.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
now drop down to the 4 hour & the hour

the point is mtf trading with the trend!!!!

& its getting the trend not the breakouts

I use the 1.2.3 for that

but the point of the 200ems

is that you do break outs with the trend

and with 200ema you will not get wippedout

but the 200ema is the bull bear line & it is important

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #48 ---
TEB,

It would have to be proven to me that the 200 is any better or worse than any other long term ema. I just don't believe it.

That doesn't mean I don't think it will work. I've yet to prove that one way or the other.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
totally agree with you MAs are not magnets

in fact I would say 200ema is the wildest of all the MA

and it does the opp. when price breaks over it

it normally takes off not sticks around

just my thoughts

TEB

--- 帖子 #50 ---
My point exactly.

200 xma or sma is used as a gauge of what the long term trend is doing, not nessarily something to determine trades. I don't believe many bank traders use it much more than that.

But if someone finds it profitable

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I think it does ... but that is not the point

the point is the 3 tf all together give you referance

& It is not them I am trading its the 1.2.3

you could do it with 50 ema but you would be wipped more

I do a system that uses 5emas works great

but the wipping is lots of fun

the 3 emas are just like 3 stochs or 3rsi

but the 1st point here

was to help people would could only trade once a day

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Teb, Keep in mind that I'm not bad mouthing your system.

I watched it this morning and saw a loser and a couple of winners- a net +

They were on lower TFs than you recommend.

I'll keep watching it.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Quite right...there has to be a reason to trade.  For me it's not the trend that's so all-fired important...it's knowing where prices will stop no matter what so I can enter and exit safely...

Such key points are gold in the hands of people who know how to use them.  And they work whether you approach from top or bottom... because they are not trend-dependent points.  At such points the prices WILL stop... long enough to exit and enter if one so feels inclined.

Happy trading...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
cool thats good

again I believe its the 1.2.3 system that is the strenght of when to buy or sell

the 200 emas are just for trend to get the win ratio up

Hey Teb, Keep up the good work!

I've been utilizing the EMA's for about 5 months now. Made a killing. had only three losses due to pulling the trigger too quickly. It is only now that I am beginning to truly understand the importance of EMA's, especially the 200.

What works for me, may not work for others. Some people are comfortable have several indicators and trading several times a day but I find it more relaxing and rewarding trading off the the higher TF's.

Good luck to all!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I am going to take the week off

there is some talk high up that the fed. 75bp raise last week was panic

and they didn't know about the france bank thing

which was the reason for the stock free fall.

& so that might make a differance tomorrow?

some people are saying it might & if it does it could make a big differance,

that is if there is no increase or if its less then 50bp

I have no idea what will happen ...

so I am going to keep my power dry

& have a fun week

What is the secret of 200 EMA? It's called self fulfilling prophecy. Almost everybody thinks this EMA is very important ... and therefore it is in fact important ...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
There are a lot of traders who use:

RSI

Stochastics

MA's

Pivots

Fibs

Trendlines

Whole Numbers

Elliott

Gann

and many others techniques.

Yet it has been said about them all that they are self-fulfilling. How can that be? It can't be. Each work to a certain extent. And each fail to a certain extent. It is up to the trader to determine which works better, for them. And to use proper trade and money management to succeed. And not worry if it is self-fulfilling or not.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Being a naked trader advocate, maybe I am qualified to answer this.

No matter which way you cut the cake, all these indicators and lines are based on past and present price action.  The more indicators you look at the older your data.  What does overbought mean to me? Nothing.  I've looked at RSI for years and I've seen it be overbought for weeks, and I've seen it do what it's supposed to do in overbought conditions.  What's really important is what the price is doing, not what value your RSI is doing between 0 and 100.  Price is virtually infinite, why limit yourself?

And my opinion about lines, trendlines, and fibs is that if you draw a line in the sand, there's bound to be a critter that crosses it eventually.  Same goes with price.  Try it on your chart.  Pick 3 random horizontal lines, and buy above, and sell below.  Looks like the same kind of fib success that anyone else gets....

Just my oh so humble opinions

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I agree. I am not advocating use of any on that list. I am disputing that they all could be self-fulfilling at the same time. Thats all.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I think pivots in futures trading may come the closest to being universally used and could fill the bill as a self fulfilling prophesy.

They aren't in forex because there is no consensus on what time of day to plot them.

The futures market starts and ends at specific times every day and everybody's pivots look the same.

The rest of the things you list are ambiguous and dependent on too many variables.

The exception is round numbers, and I haven't seen them work in any predictive fashion.

200 ema HATERS.  You just never looked at one on your charts have you?

If you have then you would see that it is used as either support or resistance over and over and over again on any pair on any time frame.  Now isn't that enough to consider it a valuable piece of information?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Haters?

Get your weird wording straight and calm down, bro. This is a friendly and relaxed discussion. No need for emotions or even crusades ...

Hi BWR

Ur absolutley right,check the 200ema on 30 min Canadian since begining of year and the also check it on the 4hr as well

Lots of touches

But u have to know what to do when it hits the 200ema!!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
BWR,

Did you bother to look at post #45 which shows daily cable chart for the last year where 200 XMA was "support" once. I won't bother but if you look at EU there was two times in the past year where 200 xma was "support".

Like watching paint dry waiting for the touches to happen.

yes I believe you are right

but that is true of everything in FX

RSI oversold ... why ?

because a lot of people see it & say its oversold

etc.

TEB

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I said any time frame, If you go down you will see it was touched alot more.

(that does not sound right)  I mean a shorter time frame provides more support and resistance levels   Ok that sounds better.

Sorry we are hijacking your thread TEB, I will stop now.

cool by me everyone have fun

just everyone play nice

TEB

--- 帖子 #72 ---
you have never heard bears sell below the 200 & bulls buy above?

TEB

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I am not sure what you are saying
are you say the market does't respect TL & Channels
& esp. swing highs & lows?
if so I disagree with you

if you say fibs & PP don't work in FX I agree . but for a differnent reason.

You see I know they do work in stock market and most other markets.
so why FX. the reason is very simple in the Stock market 5:00 pm EST is used by everyone
.. so we have an old boys club rule.

but in FX we have no such rule

The USA use 5:00pm - in line with their stock market
But the British are the big boys & they use their own time
so you have at least two sets of fibs & PP
& so it will not work well
& then you have all the FX teachers making money on other fibs & PP systems.

I use MA just to find the waves in the market
& they work well for that

Just my thoughts

1. TL break

2. A swing hi break

3. strong big D

Time wise, when does the day begin?

0500 EST?

Midnight EST?

0000 GMT?

The beginning of the London session- 0800 GMT?

There are people who use Pivot points who swear by each of these.

They each give a different set of pivot points.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
well my daily is from 5pm est to 5pm est the next day. so I use these values. You can see this from the charts and technically the time may be different but not the values, no. for instance its about 625pm now and my chart says 1.9884 on the gbp/usd pair but that the same value on someones chart in the uk with a time of 1125pm there!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
the values are the same at any given point of coarse

but not the pp. they likely will not even be close!!!!

so i will buy as price crosses my pp

but you will not because your pp is 20 pips higher

I am in you are not ...sorry

teb

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I don't completely understand what you're saying.

People use different times to compute pivots. You use 5PM EST, many people use other times.

There is one system on here that computes the pivot at the beginning of each session.

The pivot points calculated at different times have different values.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
yes of coarse they are based on the highs & lowes from the times frames they come from.

But even then there are diff. most add other things to the highs & lows

so even two 5pm pp systems may be quite diff.

but I was more speaking to diff times of opens & closes ie 5pm vs 12MidN

(High + Low + CL.1 + OP.1)/4

(High + Low + CL.1 + OP)/4

(High + Low + CL)/3

(High + Low + OP)/3

(High + Low + 2*OP)/4

because the last big move happen with in the H/L of my time frame of yesterday.

but it is not with in the H/L of your yesterday... right...

so your pp are much more narrow then mine... right.

ie. my H/L is 120 pips you H/L is only 80pips

because of PA so our pp are not even close to as wide as mine

Ans : Are you stupid or what, haven't you heard that the Banks use 50 ema sma lwma too! Rack it up! Wimp!.

Qn : ...and the next one? *whimpers*

Ans : Goddammit, you dimwit, haven't you read a.Elder? use the 13EMA! Wait, he changed, its 26 EMA now.

Qn : ahhh...perfect. Thanks. Now where were we? Are we trading guppy now?

Ans : huh what?

MA or not MA, i believe it take experience to notice the swing patterns and profit from it.

good sharing teb...this is definitely not for the new and uninitiated.

Take a look at my EUR/USD analysis according to 200 EMA + 1,2,3 system. Is my analysis in line with yours?

P.S also posting a second version of the same formation, using different high/low.. Which one is it? Or both correct?

P.S.S Just noticed that 200% and 300% is practically the same on 2 charts... does that tell us anything? (1.5015 level)

--- 帖子 #100 ---
looks good to me

just keep moving up your SLs

you are doing the whole swing - nothing wrong with that

I was doing the last hi & low in the swing

Hey TEB, take a look at these charts, tell me if those are valid set ups..

A- Possible set up on USD/CHF happening at the moment.

B) Something i missed on E/U a bit back, notice first target right around 1.5... interesting

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Just a small notice to the "universal look" of charts (like future charts):

1H and below charts look exactly the same on every single traders desk. But since most traders consider anything below 1H to be noise, 1H might be prefered TF for entries and exits. As someone here in forum said, any longterm profitable system should work also on 1H.

Btw for pivot points, you might wanna check GMT charts (i.e. interbank fx charts) , because majority of market movers are London (GMT) based. On those charts, pivots are good TP areas after the intraday trend, usually during morning London hours, has been set.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I see more misunderstanding about pivots on this thread than I knew existed.

What difference would it make if you plotted a pivot on an IBFX chart as opposed to anyone else's chart?

Regardless who's chart you are using, you can calculate the pivot based upon any 24 hour period you want.

For example, I can use 5PM EST time as the start and stop of my 24 hour day, regardless who's chart I'm using- or 0000 GMT or 0800 GMT or any other time I want.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
nice call Teb

I agree with you it doesn't matter what charts you use

I'd say it might be finding support level with 78.6 retracement and 61.8% price projection down from the high. ADX also at a high level 43.70 - over 40 reading is indication trend (downtrend that is) may be coming to an end.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Where do you get that the big boys are "adjusting" the pivot points to a certain time? We don't talk about what me or you are doing with pivot but what the market makers do. Of course you can set it to whatever time you want, but it is the observation of different times that tells you, which of the times works the best in what time. And from my observation, the GMT0 pivots work quite well at least till the NY session starts at 13.00GMT.

And i mentioned IBFX, because not every pivot point indicator can be adjusted (in fact, i have found only one and beside this adjusting, it was less comfortable to me as the other ones without this option).

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I don't know what you mean by adjust. You don't adjust the pivot, you calculate it.

Big boys, little boys and medium sized boys have no choice but to choose the time of their calculation.

There are several theories as to which time works best.

There are a number of pivot point indicators with selectable start times. I have three or four different ones.

I don't know what a "comfortable" indicator is. I've never heard of a comfortable indicator before.

You don't even need an indicator. You can calculate them in about two minutes and draw them on your chart with horizontal lines.

Hi TEB,

Nice method you have & yes it works.  I have been trading 20+ yrs with 11 yrs in forex & I trained with a trader who now runs a fund.  The first thing he introduced me to was the 200EMA & the use of Mov Averages.  I have used a similar method starting with the 5M & going forward three time frames.  When all agree enter.  Adding the 1,2,3 makes it even better.

Is this a perfect system, NO as none are, but it is a very simple & concise method that will work.   Will it work for all traders, NO.  You can give ten traders a set of rules to a method & all ten will see something different.  Case in point the the TURTLE TRADERS by Richard Dennis.

All said & done this is a nice simple method that will work.  The 200 MA is on the minds of traders of all levels from the Banks & Funds on down to the retail trader.  Is that their sole method, NO, but it is in the mix.

Thanks TED for another simple & chart clean method.  Keep the ideas flowing & you just might find something for all TRADERS.  Just my most humble views.

ok lets say the 1hr has just opened below the 200ema and now all 3 TF are in line (4hr, 1hr and 15min)

on the 15 min chart the market is a long way off the 200 ema

do we now put up the fractals and we are now selling into the lows (or just below that)?

cheers

...hit 208.50?

nope, stopped out

--- 帖子 #125 ---
not sure I understand what you mean

the 4 & 1 hour are over the 200ema

so now the action is on the 15 min right

it is below the 200ema... its bucking the trend

70-80% of the time price return to the trend

you could simple place a bet here & win most of the time

we want to increase the odds

we do that by waiting for a break in the down trend on the 15 min

we do that by the 1.2.3 or a TL break

(TL break on the 15 would not be that strong in my mind I would rather at least the hour for a TLbreak)

also the Fractal can get you in trouble - they are a tool but you need a strong hi or Low some times

they are weak ones!)

I hope that helps

TEB

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi TEB,

Thats right, 5M in & out or move up to the 15M, 30M, 1H & 4H.  Then 15M in & out.  EMA's are always on one of my screens, but they are not the core of my trading model.  In times past I use the 200EMA just as you are doing now on MTF's.  A fellow trader that I trained with yrs ago is a disciple of the EMA's & is very good @ trading them.  With this method there is only one EMA that you are concerned with as opposed to some method using 2,3 & 4 MA lines.  As I type this I am viewing the $/CHF & starting on the 5M & going on to the 1Day you will see just what your trying to do........PRICE has crossed down on all TF's.  Now on the 5M tf you are starting to see it crossing back up & over the 200EMA, but LOOK @ the SLOPE OF THE 200EMA........IT IS DOWN.  Now look @ the FIBS when using this method & they SHOULD help avoid the losers.  On this particular trade & probably on most starting with the 15M & progressing on to the 30M, 1H & even the 4H

just might be better.  At this time on this pair it would have been better.

THIS NOT A 100% ACCURATE METHOD AS NONE ARE, BUT ITS DOABLE.

I HAVE NOT TRADED USING MA's IN QUITE SOMETIME, BUT WHEN I DID

THEY WORKED JUST FINE.  A QUOTE COMES TO MIND @ THIS TIME.

"THE HOLY GRAIL IS NOT THE METHOD TRADED, BUT THE TRADER"

thanks for reply

ok market is above 200ema on 4 hr and 1hr

now to the 15 min we are waiting for the market to close above the 200ema and enter our trade, right?

cheers

--- 帖子 #128 ---
well,,,, you can do it that way & that is the true old 200 ema system

and its the safest way.

the problem is when price crosses the 200ema it normally takes off and makes a big move up.

so what I do is try to get in before it crosses the 200ema on the lowest time frame

I look to get in before it crosses the 200 with a swing break (or a trendline break)

back with the higher chart trends

I love this system

its become my main one

trade way less but way better!

been years since I used it-  I don't believe I ever did with forex.

I thought it would be to slow,

but the opp. is true.. because of the speed of fx it works great

you can "trap" & see the prey coming for miles away

and it keeps you out of most of the bad trades.

I have a question if the 200ema acts like a magnet has have what has been suggested, will the price eventually go towards the 200ema again and if so what is the best timeframe to see that direction in.

The reason I ask is as an example looking now at the usd/jpy on a daily chart the price needs to go up to reach the 200ema but on a 1h chart the price needs to go down, please anyone explain?

respect

Tom(uk)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I don't see it as a magnet ...rather the most important referance point on the chart. and so when it comes into play you tend to get big moves because it .

Because of the bull/brears thing - if price bounces off the 200ema the winning side sees that as a reason to add to their trades and so then price takes off.

If price breaks the 200ema you normally gets a lot of stop losses hit and so price really moves that way -

and now the other side also see this as a time to get in

-so again moves even more .

its not magic just the market.

teb

--- 帖子 #139 ---
so which is best tf to look at it in, ?

--- 帖子 #140 ---

look at price bouncing of the 200ema It normally bounce 3 times

(off the 200SMA 2 times)

then bang we have a big move.

It will likely not break until higher Vol . & when it breaks it may well take right off ;;

or it might hold  & then it will just turn south

& if it does it then it will likely  move a long way that way

way to go

3 questions

1. what are the time frames you are using?

2. you are using the 2 step exiting.?

3. Are using the 1.2.3 part of the system to get in or alway a cross of the 3rd 200?

I am just trading it how you outlined it from the beginning.

Long:

Weekly - above 200 ema - check

Daily - above 200 ema - check

4HR  -   if it is below 200 but is moving up I'll go ahead and get in - if it is below 200 but real close, I'll wait to see if it tests.  If it breaks through and the next candle opens above - I'm in!

I will sometimes put a 5-3-3 stoch on 4hr or look at the 1hr tf to help with shorter term direction confirmation.

Exits - I'm still trying to feel this out a little so I am missing some upside and getting out early.  I do not know how to draw the levels like you do, so I just look at the last low below 200 ema (for sl) and the last high above 200 ema for max profit potential.  Currently I am getting out when it seems like the move is slowing or taking a breather.  I'm trying to develop the "guts" to hang in there a little longer!

I am looking to gain the confidence to "set it and forget it" so I can walk away from it.  For now I am watching when I can until then.

I am open to your advice on how to set up the s/r levels that you always have on your chart?

Just so you know, I am putting together what you have explained here and with CC's 3 ducks ebook (but I actually like this better than 3D's).

So thanks to you teb!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
TEB63

Assuming the higher TF shows the overall trend, should one only enter if the candle opens above/below the 200EMA, or would you wait for the current 4HR candle completion?  Also, does candle color dictate whether you will take the trade or not?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hi

thats great... I like the 3 ducks to.

the way you are doing it - 3 ducks is better!

Though this is still safer ...esp the way you are doing it.

its the true old 200ms system.

What I am doing is getting into the trade before everyone else that uses this system.

My in , is the last hi below the 200ema on the lowest time frame (up trend).

So I get in before price crosses the last 200ema...

I am trying to get the big move before the 200ema cross.

The lines thing- Here is how you draw them.

Go to your fibb tool take all the levels off

- then add 0% 50% 100% & 200%

here is how you use the lines (in an up tend)

place the 0% at the last low ( becomes the SL 2 pips below)

place the 100% at the last hight

when price close over (not like 3 ducks where it just has to cross)

get in. this is the 1.2.3 system

now I am using 2 lots .

the 200% is my 1st target

(or a closses round number ie. "0" "50 or 100")( two pips below)

I close 1/2 my trade & move up my sl on the other 1/2 to 0+1

now I have a free trade

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I move up my sl every 50 pips

(- this is the easy way.. and works very well

But .. what I really do is keep move up to the next big low or last round number esp 100s.

but that is more complicated)

last target is a channel or s/r line or a turn in the market or the weekend etc

There is an ebook on the 1.2.3 ststem ,,,,

which I believe is the best system going

the way you are doing it???

not sure ... The old System was alway wait till the close

The reason the 3 duck is just over - is because its 5 mins over a S/R,

on higher TF I always wait for the close over ...

mostly because of the effects of news ....

but others would get in at the cross

... But I must say S/R is more important then a MA cross always!

thanks for the info on the fib levels

on gbp/usd are you using month/week/daily tf to look for long entry?

thanks for the ebook I hadn't seen that, just what you have posted here earlier in the thread.

I really like this method because of the mtf confirmation. I also like the moving avgs because, like smalldog said, it really is trading price action. It seems most methods trade indicators (even mtf stoch, which is not bad). Lets face it we are not buying/selling indicators, we are buying/selling price.  I also tend to think that technical indicators are more true to longer tf's.

Hi

I just wanted to add a few things

the lowest I trade this in this system is the 15 min chart

on that chart I do just A close over of the 200 - not A S/R break

ALL other TF I go for a S/R break- hopefully below the 200ema.

the 4 hour & above is amazing %

the hour & 15 are quite a bit less

under 15 mins I use the 3 ducks

Which is great

I use 2 charts 1 hour ( with the 4 hour ema on it) set up easy to see

& then the 5 mins just for he 200 EMS cross & R/S cross

I am not using TEB2 at all at this time at all

The 200ema is the easiest & most stress free way I have ever traded.

you see trades coming a mile away

Looked through the thread; thank you for sharing your hard work.

Regarding 2 TF's above or below 200EMA and 1 TF opp to that, does it matter which one is opp.

Logic dictates that the longer TF's are opp the shorter TF as a set-up.

eg DAILY/4 HR above 200 and 15min below.

Is that correct or can any combination of 2 TF's be OK.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
No, I wish! This is strictly demo for me right now.  I'm just taking all the trades that meet the wss criteria and watching to see what they do.  I do like the method, but I just want to continue to test it and grow my confidence.

Teb, are you using 3 ducks for shorter term trading, and wss for "set it and forget it" trading?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
it always the smallest timeframe in the sequence - that is bucking the trend (going against it)

I think you are dropping down to quickly in your example i.e should be : daily, 4hr, then 1hr.

If you wanted to trade the 15min - then use 1hr and 4hr above

regards

Red

--- 帖子 #186 ---
yes you are right

I see the three tf as the followings

lets say we are doing day, 4 hours, 1 hour

the day in the trend chart

the 4 hour is the trading chart

the 1 hour is the signal chart

Hi Tebs,

If the trade entry for a short is below the 200 (see the USDCHF 1 HR chart attached) do you still take it or only take a break of S and R above 200 for a short?

In this case would you look for a smaller swing with an entry above the 200 or pass on the trade?

Thanks.

I shorted u/chf earlier today at 1.0998.  I think there is some resistance at the 200 ema on the 4hr chart.  Hopefully looking to pick up about 50 pips!

Also long on gbp/usd at 1.9464 following the month/week/day tf's.  Looks like it may have some potential to move +150 pips or more over the next couple days.  Hope so, we'll see!

Thanks TEb,

The chart is in the following post; #191

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thanks all for your work and input

Euro - Yen is one I have been watching.

Monthly above 200

Weekly above 200

Daily below 200

4 Hour above 200

Therefore, I should look for a 1-2-3 trigger on the daily chart.  Which it looks like we are getting close to:

1 - Dec 30th

2 - Feb 7th

3 - would be a sustained break above 159.50

The trend on this pair does appear to be down so I probably shouldn't gett too greedy with TP or too loose with SL.

Your comments please

Hi TEB,

Just repeating my question for you.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
You talk about 3 charts:

TREND

TRADING

TRIGGER

TREND is obvious

TRIGGER alerts you to the trade

But do you trade off the TRADING CHART not the trigger chart?

Surely, the swing is off the TRIGGER CHART?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Sorry teb - I must be missing something...

Sometimes I can't see the forest for the trees...

Are you saying you prefer $Y over the EY.  I am not in a $Y trade - no Y exposure.  That is why I am looking at EY.

What am I missing?

Hey red!

For all of my trades I have used day/week/4hr.

I used month/week/day for gbp/usd (currently open and up 165 pips).

It is still below 200 ema on the day and I am sure will pull back some, but I'm going to ride it out and see what kind of upside I can get. I have been trigger happy to close trades and have missed some upside. Not trying to be greedy, just want to trust the system and set the sl/tp and walk away!

Thanks to teb for the wss!

Teb - where would you put your SL on the eur/jpy trade?

Lux

2 pips below the "0 fibb"

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Often you can do a trade in a number of pairs

the best known case is the USD/CHF & the EUR/USD

almost always the two pairs move at the same time.

( theseare the two pairs I trade the most)

Now which would you take.

I would take both are you are doubling your risk.

If the usd is going up I would do it against the chf

If its doing down the eur.

Because of the interest on the pair.

TEB

--- 帖子 #218 ---
So that would be about a 550 pip SL with a 1:1 RR?

Thanks

Lux

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi lux

4 things.

1. its carry trade... So am not to concerned

2. 1 to 1 only on the 1st lot ... 2nd lot I will let it run

3. if it really dropped ... I likely would dump it before

(likely if it closed under the big tail a few candles back around - 157.64)

4. its a day chart so need big stops esp/ yen crosses.

you got in with a breaking of the 50%?

I would not ... but your 1st target makes sence if you do.

I think I have said when you have the same trend on the two higher time frames you have an 70-77 % to be right at any point if you just bid with them, waiting for a break of the 100% puts the odds up again`

likely a break of the 50 % to will increase.

I know a bounce of the 50% does for sure

thanks TEB

To be honest, I had a little help of tow things that made me take the trade.

1- bolinger squees ((which gives me an indication there is a big move a head )).

2- crossing of ema 6 and 16,,,,,which i trust too much

I know you like your system to be simple but there is a need of a trigger filter .

Teb, would you take the trade after the Daily close above the 100 level, even though the close is near the 200 ema?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
sure... I use a close above "the 100% fib" in the up or below in a down swing.

I get in late but get a very high % of wins

Hello TEB,

I am wondering where your first target percentage lines come from, on the E/J chart posted 2-27-08. It shows your trigger 100% line at apprx 159.50, the 200% line at apprx 161.25 and the 0% line at apprx 157.71. I thought you were in long (2 separate buys are visble) on the chart you posted on 2-26-08, where your 100% is at 159.48 and your 200% line is approximately 165.00 and the 0% line is apprx 154.05. The trade posted on 2-27-08 must be a different trade, other than the 2 buys shown on the 2-26-08 chart or do the exit parameters change due to passage of time. I am referencing the high/low dates for the fib tool are different on the two posted charts, so targets are very different. I am confused.

I am in for .30 units with buy @ 159.65 on 2-25-08, after the first 4 hour close above the 100% daily fib tool line. I was using the 1-30-08 high and the 2-7-08 low for my 100% and 0% points. I know I was playing aggressively as the daily chart was not yet above the 200 MA, but the 4hr had closed above the 200 MA since the end of the day/week on 2-15-08, and the weekly and monthly were strongly above the 200 MA. I have moved my stops to above BE at 159.80 which is just below the 4 hr fractal on 2-27-08. Management of the trade is truly the key to whether you win or lose over time. I am going to keep tightening my stops to just under key low fractals and wait on my first target at the 150% line (162.17) for .20 units and the 200% line (164.91) for .10 units.

Thanks for your imput on why the charts are different.

Hello TEB,

I think this system has some merit to it as I have concluded by testing it lately. Even after applying rules loosly it still managed better than my own trading.  Thanks TEB.

I feel a need for one improvement on this system.

Here is an idea: leave expert adviser to trail pullback against main trend at, say, 50pips so it can enter automatcally.

Not sure what this type of stop entry method is called. It is similar to trailing stop but trailing stop has a position to which it is attached.  This one does not have position open yet and just calculates amount of pullback.

I do not know where to find the EA. Can anyone point in a right direction?

I have tried 1d, 4hr, 1hr, and also 4hr 1hr and 15min with modest success.

Cheers

Hi TEB63

been watching your thread, nice system. trying to see it on my charts, coming along nicely, i assume you trade this setup, would you mind explaining it some more things like when you entered short and how you handled SL as the trade was from a different position than the original entry point.

regards

MPP

--- 帖子 #255 ---
sure... thanks

1. I do trade it 90% of the time, now.

2. "... enter short ... I do the same just "upside down"

3. SL is the "0" fibb the 1 in the system.. ( 2 pips farther away right)

4. Sometimes on the day I will find a swing the is closer then the "1" in the system,

... but you know I am moving away from that and just using the "1" which is the "0" fib.

I love this system not a lot of trades - but very good ones.

on the 15min -4 hour I always do 2nd target

on the day (the longest I trade) sometimes I only do the 1st target.

I do cheat a little I use the 100 & the 50 on the charts

and make them the target or SL if they are with in 10 -15 pips

on the rightside of the my chart.

ie. target closer & sl farther.

it really is a set and go system

other questions i will answer

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #256 ---
So on the shorter term trades are you only using the two tf's?

4hr    - 200 ema trend

15min - opposite 200 ema 1.2.3, entry?

If so, I get it!

msac

--- 帖子 #257 ---
going short term now I understand.... ok

4 hour & 1 hour are one way..

15 mins is the other way

then the 1.2.3 .4 breaks towards the 1 hour & 4 hour

then you are in

enter a few pips after the break of the 200?

you got it but.... Its not the same thing I am doing.

you are in fact doing "the real old 200 ema system"

& it works great....

I am trying to get in before price crosses the 200 ema

which is often when you see a great move ..

Like here...

but in WSS its the "4" breaking the "2" level

which is the 100% in the system right.

I personally believe in S/R more then MAs.

I use MAs just for trend

S/R for triggers ...so when the "4" breaks through the "2" or the 100% fib

....you enter

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #263 ---
it's the same i thought, only in this setup the 2 (100%) is bang online with the 200ema(think blue line) daily price below 200, weekly and monthly above 200.

price going to try to break over the 100%/200ma, i know the TF are a little higher then usual, but the setup looks spot on for the 1,2,3 - 4 with a much higher target due to the higher TF, thus we can enter and let it run.

not traded this before and so far price has not broken the 100%, may be waiting for the UK rate statement.

hope this makes sense,

edit: it's a bit like having the chance to play both system at the same time.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I do day as well...

I am a bit tired .... not sure where your 100% fibb is?

I think price was over your 100%

....but didn't close over it? is that right?

I wait for it to close over it !

....normally 2 tests ... then over ...

I would not have anything on the cable right now...

TEB

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Ok I think I see what you are doing...

I am a little slow on the up take here...

anyways ... I don't see a 1.2.3 system

that is just me ... I like to see it cleaner

so I know it really is a 1.2.3. system

TEB

--- 帖子 #266 ---
OK i see, still trying to fully understand it, price broke my 100% but didn't close, so no entry.

i know this system is probably better used at lower TF, but this seemed to be spot on, there was a much better setup on the 1h with clearer swings, but i was watching the daily.

thanks for you help and understanding,

Hi all,

Anyone can teach me how to setup this strategic?

Bcos i really not so understand even i read all the thread. Any one can simple explain how this strategic work? Please advice. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thats at very well - but you need to be looking at two time frames above...

There was a great setup in Feb when the 4hr started testing (rising above) the 200ma and the daily and weeklys price was below the 200ma - which is the premise of this system...

Think you need to re-read the orignal rules and read the 3 ducks system so you understand the setup properly - Fib etc help get you in and out.

regards

Red

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Its simple really - 3 time frames - in the 2 greater time frames the price should be above or below the 200ma - the lowest time frame it should be opposite to the 2 greater - thats the setup, then look for an entry and exit based on S/R or fibs or whatever

See my post 279 - read the first part of the thread and read 3 ducks system which this system is based on...

regards

Red

--- 帖子 #281 ---
i didn't think all the trades were being taken over the 200ma.  thanks for pointing that out

Had a great trade of the GU daily cross over the 200 though.  so loving the simplicity of this.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi redart007,

Thanks for your advice.

I will try to testing this strategic by the demo account.

Please correct me if i am wrong.

short entry,

when the weekly tf and daily tf chart is below the 200EMA and 4 hour tf chart is above 200EMA. wait until 4 hour bar cross the below 200EMA then using MT4 fib default setting to set 0 to inside day high and 100 to inside day low.

First TP is fib 161.8 and second TP is 261.8. SL is above two pip from fib O(meaning that if high inside the day is 180.00, then our SL is 180.02)

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Here i have few question need to ask;

1) We set the fib when 4 hour bar cross the 200EMA or wait until completed bar is below the 200EMA?

2)What timezone for this strategic? GMT 0?

3)Which pair currency suitable for this strategic?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi TEB63,

I really interested for this WSS, because i try to backtesting it and feel that can work.

How long you test this strategic? May i know the winner ratio is 5:5 or not?

Thanks.

in fact the idea is to get it before price crosses the 200 on the lowest TF as we normally see a big move as it crosses .

you are in on the 1.2.3 system not the 3rd crossing (like the 3 ducks)

also I don't use fibs at all I use the tool but that is it,

I use 0, 50, 100, 200, 300 none of which are fibs

--- 帖子 #287 ---
this system is not baced on 3 ducks ... the old 200 ema is one of the oldest trading systems there is.

but in fact the 2oo emas are not really the heart of the system rather it is an even older system the "ol' 1.2.3 trading systen" . ...which goes back to

atleast as far are candles trading in Japan. and some prove Romes used it at the time of Christ

TEB, after having read the thread and 123 PDF, I was very interested in the WSS and yesterday spotted an opportunity to use it.

Seeing the EURCHF daily and 4hr below the 200ema, I took 2 trades based on price being above the 200 on the 1hr. I know that might be dropping down somewhat but I was keen to trial WSS and the SL was quite small.

I have just closed the 1st (riskier entry) lot for +145 at 1st Target.

The 2nd (safer entry) lot is +109 (SL now at +50) en-route for the 2nd Target.  UPDATE @ 12:22 GMT: 2nd lot Stopped out at +50.

I love the simplicity of this method and will be using it more.

Thanks TEB! - any comments to help me optimise the way I trade WSS would be appreciated.

Hello TEB63,

Please, would you mind to tell me :

1) what you mean by less than 4 hours TF just stay away from 12-5 Pm Est ?

2) Is it a real fact, I mean that trading in the 12-5 Pm Est zone gives you a worst win/loss ratio, worst Risk/Reward ratio..etc...?

3) Whatever the TF, do you trade during days of MAJOR news release ?

Thanks

Happy trading

TEB,

I really like this method and am working hard on it. Thanks for the posts that have helped me learn more.

What is the reason you have replaced Fib levels (on the Fib tool) with 200 & 300 levels that we use as Take Profit targets when using WSS?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
They are where I plan of getting out of the trade -targets

short term time frame trades ie,   1.2.3 I look  I use 300%

For reverse trend line break and higher time frame trades

of either main kind or Head & sholders W or M trades I use the 200%

TEB.. how we should now when looking at the chart... we should buy trap or we should do a sell trap.

Is it been filtered by 200SMA..

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi TEB,

what do you do when daily and weekly chart show side way ? Can we use this method in houly or 30minut charts?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #295 ---
From this WSS TF is 4H, Daily and weekly.

Are you using TF for 1H,4H and daily?

Any one can help me which time frame is better for this strategic?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi HLAng,

In Post #1 of this WSS thread, TEB said;

"4 hour 1 hour 15 is the main one I use.

Can use any three."

For the WSS trade that I posted below (#289), I used 1Day, 4hr, 1hr.

However, when I look at the charts, I start with the weekly and drill down through the time frames until I find a set-up that looks 'comfortable'. E.G. I might see price above the 200 ema on wkly, daily, 4hr and 1 hr (4 time frames). If price was below the 200 ema on the 15 min, I would seriously consider this as a WSS trade as I have more reassurance from more time frames.

Essentially though, it's three time frames that we need to look at. Andy Perry (AKA Captain Currency http://captaincurrency.blogspot.com/) also recommends 3 time frames in his ebook, which is what TEB's 3 Ducks thread is based upon. The 3 time frames that Andy talks about are 4hr, 1hr and 5 min.

I am new to these methods and am still experimenting on what works best for me.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Thanks.

I will try to change the time frame to daily,4h and 1h to testing it.

but previously i use tf for weekly,daily and 4h this WSS strategic is can work.

but the signal very less.

Hope that daily, 4h and 1h can give me more signal and earn more pip. cheers

--- 帖子 #298 ---
why not trade both sets of time frames ?

i read these ideas on another thread so thought would it be safer or over-cautious if we enter a trade when/if.........

**) buy/sell on break or close (safer) of the 2nd 1-2-3 trend reversal rather than the 1st one.

example : prices going up and then sell when prices break or close below the 2nd lower low.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
one member (paradise103) has a good idea on adding units for those wanting to pyramid............

A) after reaching profit target, close out half of units and put the remaining units at break even

B) add units at subsequent highs/lows...........then put all SLs (including earlier entries) under/above most recent high/low so only latest trade will be a loss if price reverses.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
i just had a thought about trading the break or close of the very 1st 1-2-3 reversal.............

say price has just made a lower high so if it's now sort of a head and shoulders formation. would it be better and safer if the right shoulder is lower than the left shoulder ?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
What ever works and I do look for patterns too

But I would say .... simple is best!

the problem that most people do is they keep adding and adding

The more you add ...the more you loss as a general rule.

my rule

one trend,

one tool ,

one trigger,

one target,

Thats it

TEB, you've made some great trades recently. Congrats!

I notice that your screen shots recently are of the 4hr charts. Does this mean that you are using the 4 hr as your lowest of the 3 time frames for these trades? i.e. you're using the weekly, daily and 4 hrly.

Thanks again for your help.

I am getting a lot of questions on this system

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The system is very easy....

Trigger, Stop Loss, and targets are all shown on the charts.

- At target one take 1/2 your pips out as proffit..

and move Stop loss up to +1 on the other half.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #331 ---
The only other things 2 things

1.Make sure in an up trend

a. your in, is in fact two pips over the trigger line'

b. your stop loss is 2 pips below the Stop loss line

c. your targets are taken out 2 pips below the tragets lines.

( in a down trend all opp of coarse)

2. I am very mindful of the 100's & 50's on the chart.

If my target or Stop lose or even my trigger is/are closs ot these round numbers.

esp. if they are before my targets/stop loss/ trigger I will normally make them my target/stop loss/trigger.

teb

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Teb63,

i've been using your system and it's working..........very much like KHarvell's 'peak and valley' system with the Ema and profit target added

just one question though, do you take counter-trend trades too ? if not, then really have to wait quite a while before the primary trend returns.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
TEB,

Anything new on this?  Look like the EURUSD on 1hr is something to watch here?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
AUDUSD is preparing once again on H4....

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Yes - However I think your stop and entry could be better optimised - i.e get in earlier with a tighther stop...see the two positions I would have taken.

Red

--- 帖子 #336 ---
so just trade in the main trend or can be counter-trend (eg. selling eur/usd) if 200 ema above eur/usd price on daily and 4hourly ?

--- 帖子 #337 ---
It's always better to trade with the trend, but with this method the trend is decided by the 2 higher time frames, therefore all trades are effectivly with trend - at least the ones above 1h.  just my view on this method and so far it's been a good add on to my trend trading.

i'm sure Teb will let us both know the answer later.

I use it more on the 1 hour chart as it shows the 200ema from the  4 hour on the hour sort of

Hello,

What's the indicator's name with the blank arrows on the chart?

How do you calculate the EMA 200 from an upper timeframe on a lower timeframe?  For example which is the daily's EMA 200 on the 4 HR's tf?

Thank you!

(English is not my own langage. I speak french. Sorry for the faults.)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Salut Balouf ,

1) What's the indicator's name with the blank arrows on the chart?

C'est en fait la fonction 'Fibonacci expansion" avec des réglages différents que les niveaux habituels utilisés comme 1.272, 1.618...etc......

2) How do you calculate the EMA 200 from an upper timeframe on a lower timeframe? For example which is the daily's EMA 200 on the 4 HR's tf?

Tu devrais diviser ta EMA 200 par six car 24 heures/4 heures = 6 mais ATTENTION, des études ont été menées sur des sites sérieux de trading comme EliteTrader qui montrent que ce genre de manip manque de précision et surtout n'affecte en RIEN l'amélioration de ton trading !!!

Voila, bien sûr tout ceci ne reste qu'un avis personnel

I hope this helps

Happy trading

I'm not sure about the ema question.

Rob

--- 帖子 #346 ---
not sure if this was answered already

but its easy

lets use the 200ema on the hour chart as are base

pull the 200ema off the 4 hour chart it would be 800ema on the hour chart

200 x 4 = 800

pull it the 200ema off the 15 min chart it would be the 50ema on the hour chart

200 x 1/4 =50

hope that helps

yes this is right

its basic to the system....

some times you can jump a time frame

ie. the month & week are one way and the day is opp.

you might move in when the 4 hour moves the same way as the 2 higher ones ... but its a little more risky ... bigger rewards to ....

Hi TEB,

This is a great thread.

I am watching EUR/CHF at the moment. We are bearish on all higher time frames. Chart is attached showing where I intend to enter at present. Depending upon Price behaviour next week (if it does not break 1.5900) we could have a more relevant short setup emerging in the blue box. Would you consider an entry with Price bridging the 200EMA such as this? Or would you wait until the "entire" 1-2-3 setup emerges on the upper side of the 200EMA?

Thanks and regards

K

--- 帖子 #351 ---
well if you are using my 1.2.3 system you need to see the break.

(of the 2 point right) I think that is the best as S/R break

is the best why to see what price is doing.

and that is the way I would play it.

but you can also use the real 200ema system which is the break of the 3rd 200ems

(all 3 going the same way)I find that way works better on the lower time frames.

but personally I always want a break of a S/R

Hi Teb,

I've been talking with a guy working at a huge instituition and he is telling that they are using SMAs, and most of instituitions use SMAs for the higher time frames (50,100,200) and mostly EMAs for lower time frames (3 to 50)

This confirms my experience that the 200 SMA acts as s/r a lot more often that 200 EMAs.

What do you think of this? What's your personal experience?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I see some other computation of EMA on the different TFs. Please can one just use 200 EMA on each individual chart?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
well I believe that is true for the most part

but I would say the 200ema does act R/S

but to be honest I don't use MA for R/S ... I am using them for trend.

the 200sma will work as well... I just find I get more pipswith the Ema

But I would say 200 sma & the 200 ema are the 2 most important

but one is for trend one is for R/S

TEB and All,

I like looking for divergance and since we are essentially going with the Trend, we are firstly looking for a hidden divergence (HD). That means for anyone who doesnt know that in an up trend price makes a higher lows and an indicator makes lower lows / down trend price makes lower highs but an indicator makes a higher highs. I've found looking for a hidden divergance in the middle time frame as confirmation, then drop down and look for standard divergance together with 1,2,3. So if trading weekly,daily,4hr - look for HD in the Daily. I like the 14 CCI (ignore the woodies stuff on it) but you can use most indicators - See recent trade examples enclosed.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
hi Teb,

just like to know if you ever make any countertrend trades like selling eur/usd even though the primary trend is up ? or you simply let the 200 ema decide the 'bigger' trend ?

also related to the above, say there's a correction of the main trend on the daily chart, do you still take a trade back into the main trend  using the 200 ema as usual or do you wait for any confirmation of the trend's resumption before you take a trade ?

very sorry for these tedious questions, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Please TEB63 clarify this for me.

I will like to trade the 4h, 1h and 15 minute set up.

I place 200 EMA on the 4 hour chart.

I place 200 EMA on 1 hour chart

Thia is where I have some problem ie

Do I place 200 EMA on the 15 min chart   OR just change from 1 hour chart

with its 200 EMA to 15 min chart?

Thanks for your effort.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
In fact for this set up I only use the 1 hour and 15 min charts

the hour ... I have 200 ema

and I put the 800 ema on it which is the 200 ema on the 4 hour.

then I move down to the 15min and use only the 200ema.

some times I leave the 800ema on it as i use the same charts just move down on time chart

which is ok because the 800ema on the 15min is equal to 200ema on the hour (sort of)

Hi TEB63 and Everyone,

Thank you for this simplest yet profound system and all the inputs. I truly agree that the 200MA is perhaps the most important support/resistance level that the big boys are using all the time. It is very wise to watch it closely for any trading opportunities.

To make the task more effortless, I wonder if anyone who may know any EA available that could sound an alert when the price touches 200MA (or any other important MA levels for that matter)? I can only find an EA for MA crossover, but not price/MA. Any programmer around who may kindly code it for us? It should be a very easy one to do. In any case, thank you again for such an intelligent system and all the enlightening iputs!

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hi Teb,

This one I don't understand. The Daily and Weekly PA are also below 200 EMA. I would say that Profit Taking should be in the Sell Zone and not in the Buy Zone.

Sure you are in an up channel, but this doesn't follow the rules.

Or are you experimenting with new rules? Or did I miss something?

I one time I have the 1KT on my posting but they are not there any more?

They are on my profile. but not on the posting?

Does anyone have any Idea why?

like I said it really doesn't make any diff to me.

other then I like things that make sence?

They did that to every one with 1KT status. I think they want the posting side clean and 1KT as info of one's profile. That's my guess.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
it became a bit of a badge and new traders were taking the bagde as an indicator that what the trader said would happen, would happen - 1kt gods and all that.  so now it's not on show but it's there still for the 1kt traders section.

in theory it should stop the 'you vouch for me and i'll vouch for you' nonsense as we all look the same in the main arena.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
you know there are not many.. of coarse there are some.

But I don't know the last time I missed the 1st target.

Where you get into problems is were you cross the trigger by a lot when you enter.

That is the space between the trigger and the 1st Target... is more then 1/2 the distanced to the target.

(sometimes I will take a pass on this trade)

You get the 1st target.. no problem

But then on the second lot the stop loss is a long way back.

(you move the stop loss up to the trigger line )

and the proffit on the 1st lot doesn't cover the stop loss of the 2nd lot.

.

Other then that and news times.. loss are fairly rare

but they do happen

but the down side is you don't trade much either.

it was and still is ment to identify the traders with 1000 trades under there belt - but you had those that abuse the system by asking to be vouched for and giving it the i'll vouch for you business, so in the end the meaning became diluted, by putting it in the background i hope that this you/me business will slow down and poeple can then vouch for traders they think are of the right material.

What was forgotten is the reason for starting it in the first place - experienced traders can discuss in the trading room with other experienced traders - that way the newbies would have some idea that the info was from an experienced source and not someone who had only been in the game 4weeks and thought they new it all.

personnally i don't see mch changing as we all have our favourite threads and they can't be moved so why would we, occasionally i might drop by to see whats going on, but on the whole in the hallway with the rest of you.

well that is a bit of a pain!!

I thought it would get to the top.

just not today... oh well

can not be greedy

TEB

--- 帖子 #407 ---
well yes and no.

I have said the heart of the system is not the 200ema

rather its the 1.2.3. set up

I believe the 200ema is the best tool

but the strongest pattern is the 4 hour channel

so if I see a 1.2.3 set-up in a 4 hour channel I love it

I hope that helps

maybe I should call it WSS-2

TEB

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I'm new to MT4 and just new period.  Question: what does 1.2.3 mean, the 3 TFs?

Also, what is PA?

I have enjoyed browsing the thread because a 200EMA looks simple but then channels and Fibs got thrown in so I'm a little lost.  I will spend the weekend rereading but still need the 2 questions answered.  Thanks all.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
it's 2 different systems, the 200ema is a system where by you look for 2 charts with price on one side of the 200 and then look at the third and price is below, you then play the break of the 200 back into the trend.

the 123 is another system (they both work in conjunction very well)  where by the

we play the high to low and bounce from the 50% fib area and enter at the trigger point.

this is just a quick guide but i hope this will help you break the system down.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
TF = Time Frames, so 3 TF is talking about 3 time frames, say weekly, daily and 4hrs

and as below for 123

--- 帖子 #411 ---
yes to 3 TF, any three will do, but these are the better ones for me as i prefer to trade the higher TF.

there are plenty of charts which TEB has shown the 123 on, not to many post back either.  i know it's hard to do but it pays to read and when you come accross something of interest, make a note of the post number (i need to follow this advise, so i can point people to the correct page) and a few details to remind you, it's not hard on this thread as TEB quite often shows the 123 on his charts for the new members - he has a great attitude to new poeple, so hang around for a while

also you should consider this en education facility, it takes more than a week to understand (forex - not this method), so keep taking the classes - think of it as a 2 year degree.

very right, yes............just sell everytime it goes up higher......................

--- 帖子 #416 ---
is there too much risk if i were to place my SL below the 50% (or 75% if it bounces off there) since if price were to go beyond 50% (or 75%), then the 1-2-3-4 has failed and price would likely to go all the way back to 100% ?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
That is good thinking but I would not ...but you can.

I have seen it many times go down and test the 3 point on the 1.2.3

(some times you have a tail test this area but body holds to the 3 point)

You can place it 2 pips below (or above in a down trend)

1. The the 3 point

2. A very strong S/R

3. A round number ie 50 or 100

- the 50% holds a lot, but price seems to stop around it not right at it.

aften you see a tail go below the 50% but the body remains above.

that is why I would not use it

TEB

--- 帖子 #418 ---
many thanks for your valuable advice and indeed it would be a shame to be stopped out by the long tail................

best is to have the SL beyond support turned resistance and vice versa.........

I have been doing a lot of 15min trading this week

I have been watching the 800 ema & the 3200 ema

for angle and separation and I have found it quite helpful.

its not a new Idea at all of coarse .

Here it looks like a 1.2.3 set-up is coming

but the 800ema & 3200ema are flat

so it may be a trade to not take.

just something I am looking at

teb

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi TEB,

When you say that you are watching the 800 ema & the 3200 ema

for angle and separation ...what exactly are you looking for in them?

Thanks,

Rob

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Rob

well in this case..

Both the 800 ema (which is the 200ema on the 1 hour chart)

& the 3200 ema (which is the 200 ema on the 4 hour chart) are flat

so there are little or no trend in the 1hour and 4 time frames.

we would like the 800 ema to be pulling away from the 3200 ema.

and both pointed in the direction of our trade.

so we would like all 3 emas pointing up in an up trade - the 200 is not so important.

(opp in a down trend)

I hope that all makes sence

TEB

--- 帖子 #422 ---

I thought this was a very likely trade because...

1. The 800ema & 3200 ema are both pointed up.

See black circles (the 3200 ema doesn't need that much of an angle)

2. The space growing between the 800ema and 3200 em.

See the white circles between the 800ema and the 3200 ema.

the more the space the stronger the trend .

Were your 2 buys based on a 50% level, a trendline break or a channel break?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hi Teb,

Made a few MA indicators: Daily, 4 Hourly and 1 Hourly MA's. Each has it's own color and default have 200 EMA per own TF.

If you use this indicator on a higher than it's own TF, then it will be less accurate. On the same or lower TF they will be more accurate.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
TEB,

great system in line with DOW theory.

I'm just a bit confused about your triggers.

Do you always wait for the close of the bar before you trigger entry?

And at stoploss line, do we have to wait for the close too? In post #417 it looks like you always wait, so just for clarification :-)

And do you still trade your great systems TEB2 and the last one with RSI?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
always the close of the candle.

no I anm not trading TEB1 or 2

RSI  or stoch both do the same thing

RSI is easier to use for Multi TF on the same chart

TEB, the other interesting observation is that price has not been in this position on the Euro (i.e. correcting itself with the 200ema 4hr from the underside) since early February.

Hi,

Yesterday I had a few successful trades with TEB's WSS.

Watch the 300 level. Amazing!

Setup was on April 29 to 30. TP's on April 30. GMT time.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
200 ema on daily, weekly and monthly is above price.

Will the 4hr chart lead us to a possible short?

Price has been rejected three times near the 78.6% fib level drawn off the daily, and if the lower trend line is broken, we could gain more confidence to go short. If we entered upon this trend line break (which is also at the 50% level), that could also help us with the SL size.

The only scary thing on this chart is the size of the stop loss if we followed normal WSS rules. We could look for the daily candle to close below its 5sma and for the 4hr candle to close below its 5sma before entering - as a source of more reassurance.

Any thoughts TEB?

waiting on the Eu break of the 200ema for the long run up.

i'm biased long on Aj, 200ema held on the weekly, then broke through and became support on the daily, and is now acting as support on the  4h, the 1h has dropped though the 200ema and if it holds to turn at the 50% should give us the 123 trigger long. IMO anyway

will be interesting to see Teb's view on this

Hi Frank

Sorry, the trigger is 2.0240, the low of the wave that first broke the 200 on the 9th may. it's a long way off so i'm not sure if TEB will class it a valid - i'm still learning.

MPP

EDIT: it also puts the stop a long way off.

I think I must have misunderstood TEB's safe entry. He mentioned the entry as the first high after the 200 ema cross. The S/L is pretty far as well. I don't think I am getting it. Got to read the whole thread from the start. I do appreciate your help.

Dear Teb

I tried your system, it is really simple

But the price does not go directly to the target

All times, it goes to the opposite direction and then after hours it goes the target

Did I miss something, what do you suggest

Do you think the price must go to break EMA200 because the price the is in  the opposite side ofhigher TF

--- 帖子 #478 ---
that is 4X

you will see in an up trend higher hight & higher lows  ( in a down the opp)

but it is moving in the way we want

the higher the time frames the more you see this

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thank you TEB for your reply

Do you think if we replaced EMA200 with the pivot will lead to the same idea, but with better probability

By the way, I noticed that more than 90% the price goes to break EMA 200

That' really amazing behavior

Best wishes

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I am not sure if I really understand what you are asking,

But in fact I do the 1.2.3 system

which is  the pivot,

I really want price to break the pivot on the wrong side of the 200

& will smash through esp. onthe 4 hour.

TEB

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Dear TEB

I really like your strategy, I am testing it, I just noticed in high price explosions or movement it fails

I just want to discuss some thoughts:

- When I switch from H1 to H4, do I move to the future?

In fact both are past and present

If we use a strategy that depends on crossing of two moving averages, the cross starts in H1 then H4 as if H4 is the past and H1 is the future

Your strategy assumes that H4 is the future and H1 is the past

Just thoughts to discuss

I want to try to draw a sketch of the future using reading all time frames, is that applicable?

Hi Doubletop

From TEB63  ( just so there is no confusion)

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi Teb63,

Thanks for your reply, much appreciated.

The T/Frames I am using are: Weekly... Daily... and Four hourly.

Main reason being I dont want to sit around all day monitoring my trades.

Interestingly enough I have noticed a strong price rejection on the daily chart often offers a good entry on the four hourly timeframe.

Exits are plotted using your moded fib tool, I usualy settle for an exit at the T1 level, but have noticed a few of the pairs this week went well on their way  to the T2 targets.

The pairs I concentrate on are the majors only.

I must say this is the easiest most relaxing style of trading I have had the pleasure of trading, its a real breeze especially after an identifiable 123 correction.

All the best,

Take care,

Doubletop.

Hi,

I don't know the language sql to program.

On one another thread I have found a global indicator. An example is attached.

It would be nice to take the idea.

A dashbord with all currency pairs with different timeframes.

A green point would be when the trend of the price is above the MM200 in one timeframe.

A red point would be when the trend of the price is beneath the MM200.

Why not a signal when the trend is different between the 4H, the daily and the weekly.

The same for the 1H, the 4h, the daily and the weekly.

Thank you very much for your answers and your research!

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi,

On one another thread I have found this indicator.

It shows the trend by each timeframe for each currencypair.

It uses a simple moving average.

Replace the 5 by 200.

Can someone add a column for the spread, one for the TF M30 and one for the TF M1?

What do you think?

Thank you for your help!

Testing this on M5 (as trigger TF), M15 and H1 for directions.

Anyone ever tried this? Any thoughts?

Only problem I see so far with small timeframes is the fact that there is so much noise and the 1-2-3s don't form that "nicely" + the ranges.

But so far it seems like I can be quite positive when I use some good judgement to avoid these ranges.

Ok,guys. First of all I want to point on 123 patterns. The really strong 123 patterns should have number 3 higher,than number 1 if you want enter long.  2. When we wait for brek of 123 patterns we loose pips. My practice show,that its much better to draw a TD trendline from some previous most recent high and throu number 2 in long. After price broke and closed above in long or below in short case, we enter. Such a way we can earn pips more than half of way to number 2.  For now thats. Greetings,

--- 帖子 #515 ---
The whole premise of a 1,2,3 pattern is that it a reversal pattern and so the 3 point makes a lower high or a higher low suggesting a change it trend.

A 3 point that is higher than the 1 suggests a continuation in the trend HH or LL and then the break of the 2 point would in essence be a trend line break.

Can you post some charts to explain you take on it?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I dont know how to post a chart here. If you can help me with advise how to do this, I will post it. Whats to 123 I agree with you,that it is a very strong reversal patterns,but the correct strong classical 123 must be so: number1 is lower and number 3 is higher if you prepare to enter long. This pattern works very effectevely in direction of high time frames. Cheers,

Hi TEB,

I havnt been here for a while.

Have a question. The situation from a few days ago, I attachced. Was it the right setup, with a break on he 18th?

If so, can we expect the price to move up to reach 200% Fib? (the price has not touched the 200% yet).

I predict a move up, from the current moment, but do you think I am right?

Appreciate your response.

Great system!

Are you using the FIB indicator in MT4 to set your levels:

- Base point

- 50 Line

- 100 enter

- 200 1st Target

etc...

Or do you have a special indicator ?  Can someone create one?

Thanks

Hi Teb,

I've read the tread and this system has alot of potential. I actually was using a system like this but it used the 89EMA as the line in the sand for the traend. It was just look at the daily and when price crossed the 89 EMA enter. Needless to say the 89EMA was too small of an EMA and I got wipsawed to death just by entering blindly after the cross.

Your combination of the 200EMA, 3 time frames and the 123 set up makes alot of sense to me. I used it yesterday and had a +62 pip trade on the GBP.

Keep posting your comments and charts, I find them very helpful.

It was a choppy day !!

its best to stay with the eur/usd on days like today

I think the 89 might well work

I think the bigger issue might be 3 time frames

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi TEB63!

Just a newbie studing your system ;-)

Do you only consider fractal max or min points to "draw" the 123 pattern or no matter if they are or not fractals?

Sometimes max or min are not fractals, as they are too close...

Thanks!

The Eur/Usd is worth a watch

1. Bounce off the 4 hour channel

3. candle formation & tail

Hi Teb

Looking at post 519 I noticed you dropped back to a 15 min chart for the reversal , starting with the 4 Hr and then 1 Hr. What about the 1 hr and the 30 min charts. I was unaware you could drop the time frame out of order. Thanks

--- 帖子 #556 ---
sure you can do what ever you like!

I use the 4 hour for greater trend esp. channel & patterns

I don't use the 30 so much

I but I was using 15 min,1hour & 4 hour in fact

cheers

tom

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi Teb,

Say you use the 4hr,1hr and 15 min chart combination to trade. You use 4 hr to determine the trend, 1 hr to look for 123 set ups and 15 min to fine tune your entries, is that correct? If I determined the price is up on 4 hr chart above 200MA and then price comes down and crosses the 200MA to the short side. Are we only looking for short trades at that point?

I've noticed on a majority of your 4 hr charts that price crosses the 200MA in the opposite direction (which I thought was a signal for a trend change) but you continue to trade in the direction of the original trend. Can you explain why you do that? This made me a bit confused about when a trend change actually occurs. I thought the trend change was price crossing the 200MA?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Not normally do I do that... unless 1 of 2 things happens

1. I see a break or bounce of a major trend line.

2.  Sometimes I am trading on the 15 min 5 min & 1 min charts

then I am using the 15 min as a trend leader

cheers

Hi Teb..

Sorry I didn't follow your answer very well so let me ask this a different way. I am using the 4hr chart for my trend direction and I am trading on an hour or 15 minute chart. Say we have been in and up trend on 4hr and price comes down below the 200MA. At this point would you start looking for short positions/set ups on the 1 hr chart since the trend has changed on the 4hr chart?

Hi Teb,

I don't understand why you would go long here. On the daily we are under the 200 MA on the 4 hr we are moving up toward the 200MA (pullback). If anything wouldn't this be setting up for a short trade???

--- 帖子 #567 ---
in fact I am looking to short.

I am trading now two things here patterns & the 200 ema

the patterns are just very strong & will trump the 200ema

believe me

(long 1.3027 short strong 1.2796, or weak 1.2928 )

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #568 ---
YES 1,2928 short there was the daylow on the way...

1.2796 for short if i comes today. ADR=247.  Would you mind it if it comes today and skip the trade ?

--- 帖子 #569 ---
not sure what you mean?

--- 帖子 #570 ---
ADR=average daily range = ATR in the daily chart.

some traders say if the adr is nearly 100% of the daily range they skip trades

wich await more than daily range > ADR.

So it seems that it doesnt matter for you...

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Well to answer my question and hopefully some others, I did some research, copied it and made a PDF file out of it. It tells a little about this kind of trading. Hope it helps.

Good job on the pdf...

So if I trade M15, I look to h1 and h4

If I trade m5, I look to m15 and H1

and if I trade m1, I look to M5 and M30

Does that make sense?

I wouldn't personally

esp. without the 1.2.3 break part of the system

I have found anything less them 5 mins very hard

(5 min, 15min, 1 hour or 5 min 1 hour, 4 hour)

& then ONLY with a strong trend on the last time frame

I have said the 200 ema is for trend only & it works very well

but its the enteries you make your money with

remember .

To win in the 4X you only need 1 set -up

1. A trend -- The 3 EMA

2. A tool -- The Fractals

3. A trigger -- 1.2.3 break

4. A target-- TEB Fibbs

Sorry for going so slow, but...

I understand (from your first post) that 15m, 60m and 240m is a safe way to trade this system.

But when going to 5 min, it is not clear if we have to look at:5m, 15m and 60m, or 5m, 60m and 240m? Your help is highly appreciated!

PS: BTW, does it make any sense to work also with 60m, 240m and 1 day? or even 240m, 1d and 1 week?

Hi one and all

I think everyone knows this system had like a very very very hight kill rate

the last week I have played once again with the 60sma

sometimes called the 3 duck

but its a much older system

years a go one of my teachers showed it to me.

its a good system with good M/M

well with the 200 ems I have made a lot of money

on my demo account with the 60sma I have lost a lot of money

( not real!!)

I added to both...the 1.2.3 break

The 200 ema is greatly better at least in the last 7 days

which have been a chop

which is the best time to test trend system.

if I get a chance I am going to test 200 SMA & the 100 EMA

as well

When you say:  <<I think everyone knows this system had like a very very very hight kill rate>>

Hi,

I have been following this thread for 2 months already and I have a question. How to know if the trend is going to change?

Taking GBP/JPY as a example, the 5 min to 1h TFs are all above the 200EMA. While the 4h and above TFs are below 200 EMA. Does this means that the trend is going to change to uptrend?

Same for the AUD/USD awhile ago (21 Nov).

I used the 15min to short, since 1h and 4h were still under 200ema while 15 min was above. However, soon later, the 1h 200ema went above, the trade was a loser as a result.

So I was thinking, this method may fail if there is going to be a change in the overall trend. If such a change is going to take place, is there a way to find out?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Perhaps, we could use a 5ema on the 4h tf, so if the 5ema is against the trend (200ema of 4h and 1h), then we don't trade short when the price on 15min tf is above 200ema.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
As far as i understand, this system takes profit of small deviations from a solid trend. If 4h and 1h are above EMA200 and 15m is below, but 1h changes and crosses also below, it does mean the trend was not that solid. My setups only consider when 4h and 1h are clearly above or below, and they are not going to change soon. If any of 4h or 1h are close to EMA200 I just don't trade.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
yes .. you are right .

of coarse to system is 100%

you are just wanting the odds with you .

when you add the 1.2.3 break to the system it works very well.

cheers

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I have played with the 5ema in fact its the only other MA I really use

Hi TEB63!

I am actually testing your system with eurusd, eurgbp and eurjpy: it works nice!

Which others pairs have you already tried?

As with WSS you don't have many signals per day, why not looking at say 10 different pairs at the same time (with right setups of course)?

Have you tried other products: GC, ES, YM, CL etc?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi, This weekend's setups got me over 100%. So, I'm not concerned with the 'many' - just the 'few good ones'. Besides, then I have time for a life... Thanks Teb63!

--- 帖子 #621 ---
That's what I mean: I prefer to scan 10 pairs and only trade the high probability trades than using only eurusd and increase the risk of my setups.

That's why I asked if other pairs are also reliable under WSS.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I see. The 9 low-spread, highly liquid pairs Teb63 recommends, have been good performers for me, so far.

Hi. Interesting system and I like it because its simple. Most good systems are simple from my experience!!

One question. Apologies if its already been covered off somewhere on the forum

Have you thought of perhaps looking initially at the 30min timeframe and if this shows price below 200EMA , then going down to the 5min EMA and waiting for a cross down of the price through EMA and therefore only trading with the bigger trend?

This would be coupled with a TP of say 30-40pips on the likes of Cable and SL of 20-30pips

Thoughts? Can anyone easily EA this to see how it performs??

Regards

Vimal

Hi TEB!

I have been following all of your thread with a LOT of interest. BTW this is my first post and I would like to start off with a big THANK YOU to everyone contributing such wealth to FF

I cannot understand why you went long on the USDCHF so early. The charts are ABOVE the 200ema on the daily, above also on the 4hr, and broke the 1hr chart. I understand that you are trading the consolidation pattern off the support level, but this isn't following your usual trading system ?

Shouldn't we be waiting (now that the break has occured on the 1hr) for the continuation to BUY at about 1.2070 when the pair crosses back over the 200ema?

Thanks in advance!

Daniel

A new one in eurgbp: 1st target hit!

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Thanks for a quick reply TEB,

Can you take a look at CHFJPY ? (4HR is BELOW, 1HR is BELOW and 15Min crossed the 200ema earlier and is dashing down)..... would you consider this to be a good trade and how far would you place your T/P ?

May I ask (on the side), how long have you been trading this fantastic system? Are you a full time trader ?

Regards from Malta!

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I really don't trade this pair,

and I think it's important to get to know a pair & how they feel?!

!!! I do not know NFP will do to it!!!

but there are two 1.2.3 breaks on it right now.

so if I did trade this pair.. which I don't

I would look to go short.

I hope that helps

cheers

Sorry, what does NFP mean?

Solved: Non-farm Payroll

--- 帖子 #651 ---
TEB: The CHFJPY on the 4HR was BELOW the ema, on the 1HR it was also BELOW, so I waited for it to spike above on the 15mins and got in short at 76.64......currently at +140Pips (see attached untitled.jpg)

I know that sitting on +140 aint bad at all, but is this the correct way ? Or was it just a lucky trade ?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Sorry to read that eswap.

Taking the same currency pair (USDJPY): The 1HR is below the ema, the 15mins is below the 5min ema has just broke the ema. SO, would it be correct in now waiting for it to return back to continue the downward trend ? Personally putting a sell stop order at 92.30, stop loss at 92.75 (above the key support level) and target profit at 91.55. Would this make sense?

..:: Daniel ::..

--- 帖子 #654 ---
In any case I would wait for a 123 pattern. 92.3 seems to me very low actually wilth your 5 min chart.

By the way, it is already over 93.40

--- 帖子 #655 ---
yes the 1.2.3 is the key or a bounce off the S/R works too

or a breaking or bounce off a pattern

but you need something with price action

I closed all my setups: I don't expect large moves just before the weekend: it's interesting to see how nice setups will me frozen by the weekend.

Now we have usdjpg, eurgbp, audusd, eurjpg, eurusd and usdcad in nice situation: all broke their 4h and 1h trend crossing their 5m EMA.

We can say "they are at the wrong side, waiting to come back home".

Happy weekend!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
OK TEB so basically (you) wait for one of two things:

1) Either a bouce off a key support level and wait for a 1.2.3 pattern (this is waiting for a counter trend right) ?

2) Using the 200EMAs (for e.g. daily is above, 4hr is also above, and if 1hr breaks below, you wait for it to resume back into the trend)?

Is this correct sir?

Have a great weekend everyone!

..:: Daniel ::..

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi teb,

I notice you have more than just the 200ema, care to explain what the other emas are for? Thanks

And another issue, I am still unsure how to know whether to trade or not. When the 15min is broken, and there is a 123 break but the counter trend remains and even the 1h becomes broken. What do you do then? And how to filter out such trades. Thanks

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I have the 50 ema as well sometimes

the 50 ema on the 4 is basically the 200 ema on the 1 hour

& the 50 ema on the 1 hour is basical the 200 ema on the 15 min

so one chart can do two times frame

- easier for screening for trades - one chart is all you need

cheers

here is the system
http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1228650949

see what is happening on the 4 hour

( I would also look for S/R & patterns)

you can screen very quickly with the 50ema on

as the 50ema works out to be the 200ema on the 1 hour

where is price between or is price the two emas -- no trade - move to the 1 hour

or on the same side as the 2 emas set up -- move to the 5 min or 15 min charts

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1228650974

look for price to cross the same way on the 1 hour chart as it is on the 4 hour chart

( the 50ema is the 200 ema on the 15 min)

move down to the 5 or 15 min chart to look for trades

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1228650987

now move down to the 5 min or the 15 min charts to trade

like in this chart

look for 1.2.3 breakes

bounces & breaks of trend liness, S/R and patterns

in this case all three loses and 4 winners OI would not have taken

because

1. time od day 12:00 noon est - 7:00

2.news reports

3. possition of price

etc

TEB, The EURUSD on the daily is BELOW the EMA, on the 4hr it is BELOW too and on the 1hr it has just spiked up. So do we just have to wait for it to re-cross the EMA and hop in a sell order?

I should reconsider scanning so many pairs...

--- 帖子 #701 ---
I use to analize my loses.

My mistakes in eurjpy today were:

1- Two pips below 100% target was to tight

2- I didn't realize PA was so close 200EMA: in fact it acted as a support. I should have waited to get it drilled.

3- Crossing 5EMA and 30EMA some minutes before was a bullinsh sign, not bearist.

4- I thought Pivot line would act as a resistance, but it didn't.

You can not act mechanically: measure twice, cut once.

Hope you don't do my mistakes!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Hi TEB.

There's a thing I can't understand: ¿did you trade the 4h chart? ¿did you enter long at about 1.2969?

As far as I can see, with 4h, 1h and 15m above EMA we could enter long in 15m chart, not in 4h!

I also see that, according to 1 day chart, we have:A nice pattern in progress than can act as a resistence near 1.30 Round number in 1.30: strong resistence 1 day chart PA clearly below 200 EMA For those 3 reasons I wouldn't understant a trade on 4h chart but, you know, I am still learning...

Saint TEB , I am still doubious about the target levels (for some reason my fibs don't align with yours). Take the EURUSD for example. I know there is strong resistance at 1.2965, but the 30Min chart looks okay. So should I extend my Fib to the lowest point it broke the ema (1.2799) to the highest point (the highest point before breaking the ema or after) - 1.3000 or 1.2961

Hello Teb,

Thanks for your great simple system. The entry at the first blue box around 1.2900ish looks like a bounce off of a trendline with a pinbar. Am I seeing this correctly or were you seeing something else? Also, was this one of the alternate entries that you were discussing yesterday?

I have read a fair amount of this thread, starting from the beginning, and am now working my way back from the most recent. (Hoping to meeting somewhere in the middle :-) ).

I still haven't "got" what part fractals play in your system, unless you are referring to the 3 time-frames used - I get that bit, I think.

However, are you referring to the fractal indicators that I have noticed on your charts?  I don't know how these are meant to be used/interpreted.

With thanks,

Hi TEB

From your first post to this thread the basis is "wait for the main trend to be broken".

In the trade you just posted some minutes ago, 5m, 15m, 1h and 4h have been above 200EMA for the last hours, so no trend was broken.

It's clear that you used 123 break for your entry, but not so clear you were strictly following the rule, as PA was more than 30 pips above the EMA.

Am I right?

Should we read that the previous trend down in the 5 min chart that lasted 3 hours was in fact a "trend break", although it didn't crossed the 200 EMA?

I am asking all of that because I am trying to use your system in the less subjective way: your last trade surprised me because I have an alarm in my computer to advise me when the relation PA/EMA is different in the 5m chart and in 1h and 4H, and this never happened in the recent hours...

Thanks again!

Hi TEB,

I am still confused with this method. Because sometimes there is a 1,2,3 break based on your rules but it turns out as a false signal. and the trend change totally and does not follow the 1h, 4h trend.

Is there a good way to filter out such bad trades? I have suggested before using 5ema on 4H to determine trend. and you said see the candle of the 4h. Perhaps another indicator at the 15min chart? what do you suggest.

Hi danbuttigieg!

Should I understand that EA means Electronic Aplication?

Look: I like programming although I am not a programmer. I learned a little bit of C#, because my application (Ninjatrader) uses this languaje.

But there are no universal programms: it is different to make a script for Metastock, for Tradestation or so many others.

You can take a look at the screen I am using: appart from colours etc I added some few simbols in the corners:

W means downtrend (below 200EMA)

M means uptrend (above 200 EMA)

Blue dot means over 60 SMA (for 3 ducks strategy)

And red square below 60 SMA

You also have blue and red lines as a 123 break indicator

So:

Every 5 min the sistem is filing a file with the W and M, for 1w, 1d, 4h, 1h, 15m and 5m charts. EURUSD now looks like WWMMMM.

Every time a letter changes, I get an email so I can remotely check what is happening, as I have a full time job and can not be stacked to the screen.

Hope you can think about my settings and develope yours: it is funny, same as getting pips.

Hi, i just coded a WSS indikator

1.2.3 break system and TEB's trend continuation (4hr/daily is going above the 200ema and the 5min is on the opposite side)

I have no experience in MT4 programming, but if it's possible to create an indicator that shows you when it's good to take a trade, is it also possible to create an EA that could execute a trade for you ? I have tried many of these EA's in the past but they all seem to fail in the long run. But based on the WSS, 1.2.3 or TEB's system, there's little risk things can go wrong? Or am I wrong in this assumption ?

Again, thank you for sharing oechel

--- 帖子 #774 ---
oechel, two quick questions please:

1. Should I just put the indicator in the expertsindicators folder and attach it to a chart ?

2. Should I leave the default input value variables ?

Thanks for everything

If you have just one green circle around the DAILY for example, what should you wait out for ? (just the bottom left corner telling you when a trade should be coming up) ?

--- 帖子 #775 ---
ups ! Yes I can explain. There are no Inputs you have to change....

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Hello eswap, thank you for sharing. It seemed complicated at first glance, but it is really easy I guess because I am so used to believe that trading is made up of complicated indicators and flashing lines on your screen that when I come across something so simple and something so easy, I tend to be sceptical at first.

How does the WSS system differ to TEB system ?

It's interesting to read how you coded it to email you? (you could perhaps pass it through an SMS gateway, or MSN to reach you faster)   I have the same situation so I cannot be infront of my Pc when all the action is taking place.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
We're all ears

Can you please provide the source file so that we could implement the indicator to sms you when it's time to trade?

--- 帖子 #779 ---
What is different oechel? (apart from taking off the inputs form) ?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi,

maybe some people misunderstood the indicator. It is only showing the time when the EMAs are set like TEB needs it to search for an entry.

So if there is for example a green circle around the M15 in the upper left corner it only means that the price in M15 chart is above the EMA200.

(its the same with the other circles)

And if you can read in the left corner on the bottom for example "M5 Short" it means that you can search an entry (for example a 123 entry) on the M5 chart. It does not mean to go short immediately ! It only means that the price in M15 is over EMA200 and the price in H1 under EMA200 and the price in H4 under EMA200....

--- 帖子 #781 ---
nothing  i just forgot to do it

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Cool !! Yep figured that much out..... can we possibly take it to execute a trade when the price action is crossing over from a circle that was green and is now red?

Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #783 ---
mmh do you know the WSS ?

It has 3 parts:

1 looking the emas

2 looking for an entry for example 123

3 make the trades with the stops and targets and positions as shown by TEB

so part 2 is difficult to programm.... and without the 2 the whole system would be only a crossover system. that would not work !

So the answer is: NO you shouldnt !

Hi bjohn34,

Are you putting the indicator under the \ experts \ indicators folder ?

Can you see it under CUSTOM INDICATORS when you load the software?

Are you using XP or Vista ?

Have you tried updating and reinstalling your MT4 trader ?

Hi, this is my first post on this forum. However I have been reading alot in here.

Got to this thread a few days ago and have been reading from the beginning, and so far it sounds pretty impressing. And simple

Decided to try it out tonight and took a long trade on the EUR/CHF when the 1-2-3 pattern formed on the 15m.

It took me to my 1st target and made me 36 pips. Pretty nice for the first trade using this system

Just need to figure out how to add those nice screenshots...

That's it for my first post. Looking forward to following this thread.

Hi everybody!

Should be looking at eurusd?

Weekly and dayly charts are still below the EMA (what a nice resistence there!) and 4 hours is above and can be ending its way up!

If 123 pattern is formed in 4 hours chart we can have a nice retracement to the main trend down.

We still need to wait some hours...

Hi TEB

I don't see this trade: ¿can you be a little more precise?

Thanks you!

--- 帖子 #811 ---
ok... the 3 EMAs are just for trend. This is where people miss it.

You want to make sure

1. you are on the right side of the trend

2. you have a little "piproom" right.

that is why you wait for the small ema to be on the wrong side

of the other two..

well we use the 1.2.3 as are main way entery.

BUT if you have the 3 ema right

and a 1.2.3 break

can you trade .. well yes

But do you have "pip room'?

well on a range break you know you do

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #812 ---
OK, undrestood.

So, you use the security of beeing up by the 3 EMAs to play with patterns like range-breakes   trading always in the direction of the trend.

Nice.

I'm thinking that trading of the 5 min. is to much noise.

However I monitored some trades today on different pairs just to check.

Because I was just checking it out I didn't record them.

But 4 setups -> 4 wemt to 1st target...

Think I have to make records from now on, traded or not...

--- 帖子 #815 ---
you are missing the point

you are not trading on the 5 mins chart rather its the highest chart of the 3 you are using.

with all the big moves of late I am doing 1 hour, 15 min & 5 min.

( works better on the majors.. not so good on the cross lol)

so in fact I am trading on the 1 hour chart right

confirming of the 15 min

& buy sell signs on the 5 min

So the noice of the trade is from the 1 hour chart

that is the power of MTF trading

cheers

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Susan -

What you are asking for does not exist as far as I know.

If you are new at forex be sure you really understand how it works and the potential risks and rewards before jumping in too far.Also, if new, i would suggest you go to www.babypips.com for some basic information and training about forex trading.

Contrary to what some people promise, it is not an easy way to make money, but is sure is easy to lose it.

All that being said, I find it very exciting and rewarding, BUT there are no shortcuts.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Susan, Information about the market is counterproductive, and will get in the way of your understanding. I know because, the more books I read, and courses I took; the more confused I became. And, as a former college learning specialist, I knew it wasn't supposed to go like that! So, I decided to go to the 'primary source' (the market) and see if I could learn that way. It took me almost 2 years of 16 hour days before I really understood the dynamics of the market energy. I suggest you go back in these posts, and find Teb63's explanation of the strategy and its indicators. Study the screenshots of successful trades. Then on historical data, practice applying the strategy wherever you find clean, easy-to-see moves. Then, when you are comfortable with the process, go to the right of the chart, and practice in real time. Only go live in a live account, when you can, as Teb63 says: 'See the trade coming a mile away.' Insight will come easier if you begin to think of the market as a 'dynamic, constantly moving energy'. It's definitely worth the effort - there is no better self-development program. Enjoy the journey...

Hi Teb,

Regarding the post that you removed. Were you looking to buy where there was demand at a bounce of the long term trend line. Then you went to the 15 minute time frame to fine tune your entry. Thanks for any explanation.

Hi everybody!

For all TEB's followers I just discovered the new TEB's thread here.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Thank you eswap.

Why would he start a new thread and not tell anyone about it?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Maybe his simple trading system for newbies  doesn't fit us as we are not newbies anymore?

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Hi again eswap,

I have gone through the 3 pages of his new system but something inside me is battling which one to give more weight to.

I think that the WSS is cleaner and neater, but the new system also looks interesting. I know what your reply is most likely going to be "Use the one you feel more comfortable with and the one that yields more pips"..... however I have not yet experienced any profit from any system

Which one will you be focusing on ?

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Dan,

As Teb points out, he put that newbie system up because newbies have difficulty letting go of indicators. He gave them a system where they can still use indicators and not have a bad case of withdrawal.

I would stick to the cleaner charts. Just my opinion.

Take care buddy,

Dave

--- 帖子 #841 ---
WSS for real trading and will try the new system with paper trading.

As everybody knows, you need to test a system more than one day.

Last friday was (under my point of view) a very trendy day for eurusd and most pairs, with few (or none) chances for WSS.

Different time frames were pointing different 200EMA trends, so it was risky to trade WSS.

By the other side, other systems (like the new TEB's one) were really profitable.

I must first check what is going to happen in choppy days!

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Much appreciated Dave, thank you

I guess you know how this feeling goes ........"WOW I've finally found a system that works from a great guy and great community, with clean charts and if I be careful I can actually learn to profit finally"

Then all of a sudden ........."why is he putting indicators on and messin' everything up" ? (messing in a good way TEB, sorry)

I personally love your (this thread) and will be sticking to this 200ema WSS system.

Have you been tradin' it long Dave ?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Dan,

I've been aware of the system for awhile, but only using it for about a week.(Demoing) It is working pretty good. Teb's 5 min system is great for a trending market.(Like early last week) Teb's 1 min system is good for entering on pullbacks such as fib zones and support/resistance flips. I hope this helps.

Cheers,

Dave

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi Guys

the WSS is my main system (other then no tools at all!!)

I just saw all the people bellyacking about no system that works

they were newbies & so I wanted to show a simple system that works.

It is working really really well right now because of the big moves

but then the market slows  down the 200ema will be my main system again.

in a strong trend its easy the trade ...

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Dan, From this thread, you, now, have enough info to start 'testing' its accuracy. The most efficient way to become profitable, is to go to the charts and apply the strategy to significant moves that have gone smoothly, in one direction. When you can easily do that on completed moves. Then, make sure the Autoscroll feature is off and go back to the period before the moves started. Put on your setupindicators. Then, using the 'Step-by-Step' feature, advance the chart, candle by candle. Doing that multiple times, on many moves, will give you a sense of how well the strategy 'clues you in' about its future direction. When that becomes easy, enterexit trades using the demo platform. After your confidence grows to the point where you will be comfortable trading, live; profits will follow. With every strategysystem you test, repeat the sequence of this process, until your live trade report shows consistent profits. 'Asking' the market (the ultimate expert), directly, is the only sure way, I know of, to get an accurate sense of future price direction.

Hi TEB

The attached indicator is based on your idea

It searches for trade opportunities in multiple currencies and shows signals

each signal contains: Pair, BUY/SELL, entry point and target

Please review it, and lets all evaluate it, I hope it gives good results

Hi!

After a couple of days playing around with different systems and losing some pips, I came back to WSS (for me Wonderfull and Sure System)

Two trades today:

audusd, 200% hit, then stopped out.

eurjpy, 200% hit, still in with no risk.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
It is based on TEB idea

it searches in different TF if the price below EMA200, and in the following TF is upper EMA200 then there is a trade.

The target is EMA200 itself

By the way neglect big pips' signals, it came from high TF select trades with under 100 pips target

My last GBPUSD trade before Christmas (sorry I couldn't upload it before)

2 targets hit.

Interesting to see how trailing stops help you in certain circumstances.

I use a trailing stop for PT2 of "after the second target is hit, move your stop to 5 pips before, and move it again every 10 pips to 5 pips before".

Most of the time it makes you lose some few pips, but sometimes... look what happens: 2nd target was 1.4760 and I was really filled (after trailing stops) at 1.4709!!

See the trades in white circles.

Well, I wish you all Merry Christmas! We can forget about pips for some days...

And Thanks again TEB for your support to this thread.

Hi One and all

This will be my last post

I really came here to try help help people

But now its just a waste of time

& I am going to get very bussy next week.

But I wanted say good bye

Let be say what I have been trying to say too help people.

Forex is easy to trade if & only if you keep it simple!!!

all you need is ....

a trend
a tool (all you need is one but if more 2 at most 3)
a trigger
a target

more then that and you will lose

below are two charts

its east to see the trades

The 50sma is trend

the Stoch the trigger

Targets & Stop Loss take some learning

(do the Swing or "00" & "50")

(I could have put

one 200 ema on 3 time frames

two shochs on 2 time

three rsi on one time frame.

the point is, it doesn't matter

as long as you keep it simple)

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1230911456

If you get complex you will lose!!

The entery is not really that important thing

its the exit & the managing the trade!!

I openned this account less then a month ago

I started with $5020 funny money (not really sure where the $20 came from)

I now have over $11,000 of funny money

I traded at least 5 systems ... many live on FF

on at least 12 pairs

on at least 7 time frames

mostly I hold no longer then over night

I say this to say " KEEP IT SIMPLE"
use normal tools an normal setting!!!

& don't worry or buy systems about opening

Worry & pay for learning how to managing & exiting trades!!!!!!!

if you need a simple one email me & tell me your best tool & time frame & when I get some time i wil send you a opening

But I will also send a warning

you will lose unless you have a good exit & M/M.

complex systems pay simple ones

that the facts

you need to study & spend lots of chart time

Hi TEB63,

If this is your last post, I'd like to say thank you. While I don't trade any of your systems per se, I have learned a lot about how to get a feel for what price is doing by reading many of your posts...a couple of time frames, minimal indicators, and pay attention to price.

I have particularly enjoyed your 1-2-3 and fractals trading and your use of the fib tool. I use those a lot....to add help me find entry and exit points on top of whatever I'm looking at.

Good luck in your trading...or whatever it is you are busy with.

To add price levels to your fib tool in mt4, put your fib tool on the chart, double click the diagonal dotted line, then right click one of the dots on the line. Go to fib properties, fib levels, then add in the %$ like I have in the picture. I hope this helps.

I use 3, 200emas on 3 times frames

I have been using 50ema for pip room

and to see how strong the trend is

the Stoch is a diff system I also use

in short term trades I use candle formations as triggers

(30 mins 5 mins 30 sec)

in longer tern trades the 1.2.3 on the shorter time frame

(4 hours 1 hour 15 mins)

targets & SL same as always

Hi,

I'm not sure if I'm doing this right, so any comment will be highly appreciated. I am using three MACD histograms to represent the three 200 ema lines. So when the 2nd and 3rd histos agree (1hr and 4hr), I am waiting for the first one (15min) to disagree. That is the heads up signal. The trigger I use then is a CCI (13) crossing the 100 level from above (bearish signal) or -100 level from below (bullish signal).

In the picture, you can see the vertical lines, always preceded by the headsup signal of the 15min histogram. The vertical lines are bearish entry signals. The first two signals are more obvious, but the three last ones although valid, seem to be in a zone where the momentum of the higher timeframes is exhausting, so less pips to be made. That brings up some questions about stop loss and profit level. 35-50 pips profit would be possible for the first two trades, but barely 10 pips for the last one. what would be the best money management for all of them?

Hi TEB63

I cant understand this system. also my english is not good

would you tell me actualy when we can buy or sell on this system. for example when the price is top of the ema 200 we can sell until price touch the ema200? am i true? or we have to wait for price break the ema200 and trade at the direction of market?

would you give me an example (with picture ) and put mark on the picture (buy point sell.. s/l )?

excuse me if i am bigginer

thank you

Hi Teb

Thought I’d revive this thread as I’ve been trading this system for the past 5 days or so and have had quite remarkable results for a newbie. Hi all my names Mario. I like the fact that all the decisions are price driven, no indicators except 200ema. I really like its simplicity.

I especially like the fact that you have targets. A place to get out as well as in. Nice work

You can see from my results that a couple of times I was stopped out before reaching the 1st target, I bought back in (same direction) almost straight after, and as we know we're trading with the trend, I recouped my losses.

Is this something you would do???

Another thing I was wondering. Obviously we should stay clear of major news events. But what if a news event helps create the 1,2,3 pattern. For example, lets say price is rising (1), a news event comes out and causes the price to fall (2), then price begins to retrace and rise again, and consequently we hit are buy entry.
Should we avoid this trade???

The last thing that’s frustrating me, bit more of a general question and possibly a new thread entirely is pricing strategies between currencies. I've been trading every currency with 0.4 per pip. Obviously if you trade the GBPUSD at this level and the USDJPY at the same level, they won’t necessarily correlate, and I'd like to factor this into your system. Does anyone have a rough idea of how much to place on each currency pair so that you can make consistent amounts between them?

(Few, hope you understand what i mean)

Thanks
Mario

I think I'm going to like this system Can you check the cart below and see if what I've set up makes sense. As you can see the sell that I had before I read this is way off, hopefully everything works out. Anyway with your system I would have placed a sell @ 1.0537.

Is that correct?

Now in the past I would have seen this coming so can I put my trade in ahead of time before it hits my entry point or do I have to sit there and wait?

Hi Scatch99,

I think TEB likes to get in on the wrong side of the 200 EMA because once it closes past the 200 it usually shoots off. Then you would enter on a 123 break at 1.0590. As you can see this made the first target considering the 5 pips he normally subtracts from his targets. My entry looks to be a little higher than yours.

I guess its more or less a set and forget. My most profitable trades have been when I have left the room. Then you let it do its thing, after all you have your stop loss and target in place. I just make sure I am trading comfortably risking only 3-5% of my account.

I have been trading this method for a couple of months now and its been the really profitable. Its so simple and mostly keeps you on the right side of the market. The times when price has gone the wrong way have failed to trigger my entries anyway.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
maptoprofit,

I see that your indicator is not WSS. You use only the timeframe and one above it to get trend? As far as targets, etc., how did you come up with those?

I think if your indicator went along the rules of WSS (3 timeframes: e.g. H4, H1, and M15), and StopLoss and TakeProfits were included, then we'd have a good indicator for WSS. And if it were done correctly, it wouldn't be that far from getting an EA done. Just add trading capabilities to use those StopLoss and TakeProfit numbers (easier said than done, but can be done).

BTW, I do like that you have multiple pairs being watched in your indicator.

Regards,

Don

Nice job on the trade.

I didn't have those triangle trend lines.  Instead I drew that as a rising wedge in a down trend.

Either way I didn't trade around the news.

I found this tread on Sunday   now Monday in NZ.   Thanks to Teb63 and all the other posters here. I have gained so much from it thank you.

I have just been looking at pairs and found one that I think is set up ready to trade. U  J .  Please tell me if I am any where near getting this sys right.

I see W1 & D1 price below 200ema  H4 above 200ema

1, 2, 3,  forming with a trigger at about 83.67

TP,  1  @82.85    TP,  2   @   81.83

SL,   @  84.50      total pips 186  Is this any where near what I should be looking for or am I still a mile or off track.  This my first  shot at this so your comments would be welcome.  ( please be kind )

I will try and post my H4 chart

Are you laughing at xetrader?

--- 帖子 #902 ---
I had a good laugh at xetrader's question too....Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is the most popular indicator in the galaxy of indicators, a google search will bring up a million pages on it. It is like looking out at the sky and asking, where's the sun?

Bonjour Oechel,

Many thanks for your very usefull WSS indicator.

If I may and for those who get some problems for reading :nerd:, could you made some modifications :

1) Could you display circles around the time frame more biggers for getting a better view (I have difficulties to read them) ?

2) LETTERS in circles are NOT easy to see too, so please could you put 5, 15, 30, H, H4, D, W and M in BOLD letters ?

3) The M30 time frame disturbs me a lot because I don't trade this time frame, so is it possible to remove this 30mn time frame ? In fact, the M, W, D, H4, H, M15 would be perfect for my trading  .

4) Lastly, is it possible to extend at the left corner on the bottom for example "M5 and M15" to "H, 4H, D" ?

Examples, "4H short" when D and W is UNDER the EMA 200 or "D long" when W and M are OVER the EMA200.

Many thanks for your careful attention,

My best to you,

Angel

good systems let stuck in stupid fighting

this is an easy system!!

just follow it, really is a simple system!

cheers

--- 帖子 #907 ---
For this system  - you need to watch the angle on the 1st 2 charts

Keep away from Chop

you want a good angle on both.

you do not want price bouncing below and back up on the 1st two charts

clear clean trend

on the AudUsd charts in the ill.   the 4 hour is great - the 1 hour chart is bad

so the 15 min is meaningles

Also: watch the swings esp. the wrong side swings

ie in an uptrend watch the lows - you want higher lows!!!

Bonsoir TEB63,

Firstly, let me thank you for this thread.

Just for sharing, I made this week + 8% on a demo account (42 trades  : 27 wins and 15 losses or 64.28% of winning trades).

Time frame used : M-W-D-4H-1h and 15M (I don't use 5M)

If 2 higher time frame get the SAME color I get down to find the opposite color : for example, W and D are red*, if 4H is green* it's perfect BUT if there is NO 123 pattern, I get down to find a green time frame with the 1H and 15M too in order to find a 123 pattern.

Because I skip time frame, the 123 pattern should be CLEAN, CLEAR and obvious.

1% position sizing for each trade

I take a full profit if prices reach the 200% level or 1R

The winning rate is lower because I don't use exactly your method

Another example if D an 4H are green, the 1H SHOULD be RED to enter a trade but if there is NO 123 swing pattern on this time frame, I get down to 1H and 15M to find a 123 pattern ONLY if the current time frame is RED

In fact, I give it this try in order to check if this method takes care of itself

Thanks for your attention,

Let's see if this method will work the next week,

Angel

* Green=prices are OVER the EMA200
Red=prices are UNDER the EMA200

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Bonjour à tous,

Just for sharing, this is below my weekly trading results :

38 trades for 17 wins and 21 losses, or 44.74 winning % rate.

Even with a lower winning % rate, I even made €385,21 or a little +0.73% of my demo account.

Tweaking slightly the basic WSS method brings to a LOWER win rate and too much trade, so I decided to get back to the BASIC WSS* method even with a profitable WE !

See you next week,

Merci de votre attention,

Happy and fun WE,

* A big thanks to TEB63

I have two of  them, can you offer one...

Bonjour à tous,

Just for sharing, this is below my weekly trading results :

34 trades, 19 wins for 15 losses, 55.88% winning rate for a +1% on the demo account*

A better winning rate than the last week, not huge profits but still profitable, that's all !

See you the next week,

Happy and fun WE to all

* 1% risk for EACH trade

--- 帖子 #912 ---
what risk to reward ratio are you doing ...

do 3 to 1 and you would be in the money

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Bonjour TEB63,

Firstly let me thank you for all you have been doing on Forexfactory !

I use 1 to 1 risk to reward and I'm still in the money.

You're right when you stated to use a 3 to 1 RR but the more you increase your RR ratio the more you decrease your winning trade rate, if you see what I mean..................As we know, this is the EXIT that makes your trading profitable or not !!

What I like in your method is the "set and forget". NO guesswork at all, I place my trade and I forget it till it hits my TP or my SL knowing the fact that I DISMISS all the pairs concerned by big news of the day.

In reality and NOT on the paper, it seems that this exit method stated above seems to take care of itself after 3 weeks and 114 trades.

I agree that less than + 10 %* in 3 weeks is not huge but it stays profitable.

Let's see what the next trading week will bring us.

Merci de ton attention,

Happy and fun WE,

* 1% position sizing per trade

--- 帖子 #914 ---
ok I do understand,

when you say you are 1 to 1 are you accounting for spread and slippage ?

if not you are less then 1 to 1 right!

try a 1 to 1.2 or 1 to 1 .5

I see the 1 to 3 risk to reward as my greatest weapon!!

by the way great work!!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Hi TEB63,

Following yours questions :

1) when you say you are 1 to 1 are you accounting for spread and slippage ?

No, I'm not accounting for spread and slippage. I just add + 4 points in my risk size as my entries/Stop loss points are 2 pips beyond the 123 pattern, or + 4 points. Even with that, I have to be less than 1:1.

2) Try a 1 to 1.2 or 1 to 1 .5

Okay for that. I'll start with 1.2 for the next week.

3) I see the 1 to 3 risk to reward as my greatest weapon !

I agree with you, 1:3 is the greatest weapon, but does it mean that you take your FULL profit at the 1:3 risk to reward level or do you split your take profit ? For example, 1/3 at 1:1, 1/3 at 2:3 and the last 1/3 at 1:3 risk to reward level ?

4) By the way great work !

Thanks to you, I just apply your method like a robot just by setting trades and waiting that the market catch them for going WHERE it want to go ! Friday afternoon  is the only day I close ALL my trades, in or out of the money no matter ! The other day, as a trade is catched by the market, it's a full profit or a full loss !

We'll see if this way of trading stays profitable in the long term (at least 3 month in a row)...........

Thanks for your attention,

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I let the target remain the same

I will move the stop up even to BE

on the weekend I will sometimes move even beyond and up to protect pips

if you use S/R or S/D I look for a target of 1 to 4 and take it at 1 to 3 RRR

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Hi again,

I do understand, you let the target remain the same and move your SL to BE as you're half in profit for example. I notice that moving my SL to BE leads to many BE trades because a trend moves usually in zigzag swings (implusion and correction, impulsion and correction...etc...) and not in a straight line !

Thanks for having shared with us your trading style, it's kind of you !!

Happy and fun WE all,

--- 帖子 #918 ---
yes if you are not careful

( in an up trend)

only move to BE after price made a higher low and then a higher high over the entry and  is moved up again!!!

ie.

Green is the entry

red is the 1st stop

when price moves into the blue box - and closes over blue line

move up the stop to the entry - BE

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Ok, I better understand now.

Thanks for this valuable info,

Hello TEB63

I am new to this system and have below questions

1. is there any tool that alerts of PA crossing the 200 ema? so that we dont sit in front of all pairs waiting for it?

2. what other indicators/things we should use along with 200 ema? for confirmation etc. I personally use Heiken Ashi all the time.

cheers

--- 帖子 #921 ---
in fact the entry is when it takes out a hi or low on the 3rd chart- so you just set a limit order and go away,

- with the 200 system I might watch the charts 4 times a day for about 10 minutes - that is it,

Heiken Ashi I am not high on them personally but whatever works for you

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Bonjour TEB63,

I use ONLY "stop orders", not "limit orders" because it's a breakout entry and not a retracement entry.

I use to set +/- 2 pips from my entry/SL, so how many pips do you set your order from the last HIGH/LOW ?

Thanks for your attention,

--- 帖子 #923 ---
TEB, what are proper values for EMA 200? (shift etc)

and should I apply various values for ema for various timeframes?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
while playing with WSS I noticed that not only PA crossing ema means nice trade but bounces on the EMA generates nice trades as well..

look at the example...on my XAU/USD m15 chart there are two...using Heiken ashi's we can make good pips by entering from 1st or 2nd reverse candle confirming it by 5 EMA.

in this examples, each made 450+ pips..

--- 帖子 #925 ---
just close standard simple

I have found out the simpler the better in trading

each TF is the same 200 ema closed

--- 帖子 #926 ---
whatever works as I do not see the 2 other charts I do not what I would do

what you are doing looks great - But the 200 ema system is a trend following system

what you are doing is looking for highs and lows.

I do both type of trading - but not with this system - this system is just a trend following system - not highs and lows

--- 帖子 #927 ---
I use Oanda they use limit orders for everything they do not have stop orders

The lines thing- Here is how you draw them.
Go to your fibb tool take all the levels off

Hey TEB,

I took a trade based on your original post. GBPAUD on Weekly and Daily is up over the 200EMA while on the 4 HR the price was well below the 200. I set up a buy stop over a recent high and it triggered today. Thanks. We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Traders

I have observed that you can have three lines for this system.

200 EMA(Close of Price)

200 EMA(High of Price)

200 EMA(Low of Price).

This channel acts as a great support and resistance on any time frame.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Hi Mike

I would not have taken this trade

see line 1 (yellow line) - price never really left this area so it could come back to it.

- you want a clean clear 1 2 3 break

- you want to see some space between (a) the two top points and (b) the two bottom points

in this case its easy to see where the stop would go - I would put my stop at line 2 (red line)

also I would only trade pairs with at least one of the following in them the Usd, Eur, or Jpy in then (also the audcad)

I always think twice about pairs with Chf, Nzd and Gbp in them

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi Rich

I am not a great believer in  tools esp. MA for S/R

I really only using them for trend

I think you will do better if you use price for S/R

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Thanks for the advise. I admit my stop was in a stupid place. The last swing point there made much more sense.

So you are looking for a 1,2,3 pattern and then trade the break of that? Ok. I thought it was just play the break of the recent highs there.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
the 1 2 3 break is better

you want at least 5 to 7 candles (more the merrier) in between the two highs that have a big space down in between them

basically you want a hole!! see the two red circles

Hi guys! Thanks to TEB63 for interesting strategy

I'd like to clarify, if I get this entry thing right.. Let's say, we have EUR/JPY: weekly and daily are above, 4h is below, - so according to 1-2-3 idea we should enter like on my picture?

PS sorry for noob question, I'm currently reading whole tread, haven't finished yet though..

--- 帖子 #950 ---
hi pip thinker

Maybe

(1) you need at least 5 to 7 candles

(2) The more space between point two and break the better!!

(3) You want a clear test and  break of point 2

(4) and price can not take out point 1 of corse

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Many thanks for your reply, TEB63!

I'd like to ask if it's ok to use only one TP (at fib 200% - with 1:1 RR)? In your opinion - will it weaken the trades? I'm intending to use "set and forget" plan

Another question, if we were trading with this system only Weekly-Dayli-4H, how much trades could we have in a month on average?

Thanx in advance:nerd:

--- 帖子 #952 ---
BTW, it's my understanding, that NZD/USD is ready to fly, no?

--- 帖子 #953 ---
ok as I have said before I do not trade this system much.

I do trade it in the summer in thin markers

its a very safe system and good for people to learn to trade - I did !!

Also I said it was for people with day jobs - as you normally have like 8 to 16 hours to set your trade

But few trades made, maybe 4 a week might get 2

--- 帖子 #954 ---
the only thing is your TP needs to be more then 1 to 1 RRR

- look to the week or day chart and make sure you have a target

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Much obliged for your response, TEB63!

I understand you're not trading this system at the moment, but still hope you'll find time to answer again, it will really help me.

Is it about distance between 2 and 3 or is it about the whole 1-2-3 formation? Sometimes between 1 and 2 there is only one or two candles, but it still OK, right?

I thought, if I have 1:1 then by the power of  > 50% win ratio it will be enough to succeed. But since you recommend it, I'll look for some S/R structures on higher TF for exit, is that what you meant?

And I must say 2-4 trade a week is a perfectly fine with me.

Good luck to you!

PS On two higher TFs the price should be not just higher/lower than ema but "well" higher/lower, right? If it is just 30 pips away, that is not enought and we should not look for trades?

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Hi, everybody (if anyone besides me is interested in this system lol, maybe I'm talking to void)

OK so, EUR/CHF is one of the pairs suited for this system, right? So, monthly and weekly are down, but daily is just returning down from above. See the pic!

PS I just stumbled on a list of best pairs by TEB63 and it turns out EUR/CHF is not the best suited for the system, heh. Now I'm kind of worried about this (trying to risk as little as possible), but at the same time as I've read monthly and weekly trends are the strongest, so may be it's still a good idea to trade this setup...

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Well PipThinker, you're not talking to a void. I am folowing this method also as I like the higher trend following potential edge.

As far as 1,2,3 formations I am no expert. If Teb63 says the best formations have a 5 to 7 candle space between highs and lows then you have that on the EUR/CHF setup. You want the best set ups though. If he said that EURCHF is not a great pair for this system then this may not be a best set up,

if you're trying to be conservative.

Just saying that he probably knows this system really well.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Hi, mikeh3855!

If it's not too much trouble, could you tell me how long have you been testing this system? I'm currently reading fascinating stories of guys who tested it in past years, but it would be cool to read about experience of someone from my own era so to speak

(1)  7 candles between points 1 to 2  2 to 3 or 3 to break

(2) 1 to 1 RRR with kill you in a trend system

if for no other reason then because of spread and slippage -  so 50% win is in fact a losser

I just took a buy trade on USD/CAD. 1H and 15M above, 5 min - below. Now, when this is over (I won lol) I can't remember if It's worth trading TF below 15 or not? May be it was wrong to enter like this?

R:R was 1:1 (with adjustment for spread), still trying to figure this 1:[very much] thing

OK, good luck, people!

PS it was my first trade with this method

wow I didn't realize this method is so well tested, I applaud your determination!

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Nice trade Pipthinker.

Teb, yes, great advice about the R:R. Trend following system: win loss ratio low but R:R high.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Yeah, after i quit that trade (with profit of 7,5 pips) price continued to move in the direction of my trade for 21(!) pips, that's how much (3/4) I leave on the table

--- 帖子 #967 ---
you were going for 7.5 pips on a 4 hour chart? the spread was at least 2 pips!

Not sure you will make a lot

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Hi TEB63!

My spread for USD/CAD 0.9 on average (during London/US) and, of course, I factored it into trade, so RR was still 1:1.

Another question about R:R - do I understand it correctly, that this system has less then 50% win ratio, hence the need for more than 1:1 RR? I think I made a mistake by presuming it is a >50% win system, so 1:1 will be enough.

And yet another question, if I may - we need not just a breach of "2", but we need a candle to close above/below it, right? It was somewhere in a tread, but there was a lot of talks about entering through a pending order - which normally presumes a trader just need a breach (with exception - when price already closed above/below and retraced back).

EDIT: one more question: suppose we have - Weekly above, Daily above, 4h below (so we wait for trade long), 1H below, 15 above - So should we also wait for trade (short) on 15 min? Technically it qualify, is it alright? Or the fact that it's against global trend overrides the fact it is in direction of closest higher trend?

Another EDIT: I just avoided a loss because I didn't want to take a "in line with higher trend but counter to Global ultratrend" trade on EUR/USD 15min.

Good luck to you and everybody

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Hi Teb63,

Thank you for sharing this system

First trade with it EUR/USD.

The 4H and 1H both under 200EMA, 15min above the 200EMA. Sell order at 3 triggered.

TP at 1:1RR and 1:2RR

Does this qualify as a good setup ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #970 ---
A pity I missed a EUR/JPY 4H, wasn't at the computer at the time

The distance between "2" and the brake was small, so I'm not sure it was really a good setup though...

[quoteDoes this qualify as a good setup ?][/quote]I understand you're asking TEB and not me, I just want to point that IMHO while your trade setup is correct, you've pictured 1-2-3 scheme in inverted order (what you've pictured is a buy setup)...

Anyway good luck with the trade!

PS I forgot to mention I talked about this very same setup three posts ago, and why I didn't take it, obviously we wrote our posts simultaneously

--- 帖子 #972 ---
no sorry

--- 帖子 #973 ---
here is a set up and a better set up

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Please explain where is snipping tools

--- 帖子 #975 ---
hello TEB, thank you for this thread. This is teaching me alot.

I have a question about the entry.

In one of your posts you said:

and also:

So im a bit confused about where to place the order. Could you clarify?

In the example i have enclosed, there is a 123 setup. Would you place an order at :
a) the break level of 2,

or
b) the pullback to the level of 2 after the break,

or
c) after price has left the level of 2 by some candles.

Thank you in advance !!

A retest is great!

I normally just do 3 pips (or 2 pips plus spread) beyond the two point on an hour or less

over 4 hours you will have lots of time to get in normally.

But even better is when price breaks back over the two point towards the 3 point it gives you better RRR

The 50% fib (not a real fib!) is the best and I would use a 200% target and not the 400% target.

patterns on the 3rd chart

where the 1st 2 charts are up trending

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I had to let this sink in but i think ive got it now !

Thank you for the explanation

its more psychological for me i think....placing the order at point 2 but then seeing the pullback makes it scary...or waiting for the pullback but price runs away and missing the chance...

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Weekly chart - (1)  200 ema- down trend looks good - important (I have a 190 ema just to show better)

Daily chart - (2) 200 ema - down trend looks very good - most important of the 3 ema !!!!!!

4 hour chart (3) Not a great trade possibility - the reason is the stop has to be placed to far back.

4 hour chart (4) 200 ema- not great- it maybe tradable- if the other 3 points above were ok

--- 帖子 #980 ---
you will miss lots of trade set ups! its better to miss 3 bad ones and maybe miss a good one and take only 1 good trade - less is more in trading

"...pullback makes it scary...or waiting for the pullback but price runs away and missing the chance" that is why its better set and forget your trades

--- 帖子 #981 ---
yes thank you, this helps alot !

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Looking at setting up a trade on the USDCHF H4....

Would you agree? Any comments ?

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Don't know what Teb will tell, but in my eyes it's OK, though would be better if 4H ema was donwsloping.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
oh indeed, i have to keep an eye on the slope.....

thank you for replying

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Hi TEB

I also have only 200EMA. Its a floating S/R as well.

I suggest adding daily line indicator to NY close.This way you can see visually daily bias.Orange line EST is -7

Regards

--- 帖子 #986 ---
pip thinker is right about the slope!

but more to the point you do not have a clean move (hole) at the 2 point - price is hanging around - no clean rejection to the up

also you want at least 5 candles between point 3 and the break

- so I would not put in a limit order where you did

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Thank you for the reply TEB !

Interestingly, i was re-reading my notes from your thread right after i put the trade in , and saw the "hole" comment you had made. I immediately knew it was not right, but i let it ride anyways....

Im still in the trade; the  trade has come dangerously close to the SL and could go either way, but it is clear it was not a good setup.

Slope & Holes ! Important to remember  And i see that NOW there really is a Hole on the 2/3 line........

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Hi all

simple and seemingly brilliant strategy this is, I just have one question so far; which support do you use for the SL? I see that Teb uses the nearest sometimes but also the steepest occasionally.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #989 ---
I think where you put your stop is the most important part of trading.

its a real science not an art.

if you use a good RRR and good stops and have even less then mediocre entry you can make money

But

you can have spot on entries and poor stops and  poor RRR and you will loss money - NO QUESTION!!!

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Man I love FF so much junk

To trade keep it simple

1. Find a trend-

2. Find a good stop - whatever you like - S/R S/D "OO" & "50" the other side of a 50, 100 200 MA whatever.

3. Find a target - whatever you like - S/R S/D ”OO" & "50" the other side of a 50, 100 200 MA whatever  (I like it on a higher time frame)

4. make sure you have a good RRR

I like 1 to 4 so I can target 3 to 1 and if things change I can take it off at 1 to 2 and feel like a winner or better let it run.

5. Only trade in tradable times.  Best 2am to noon est. or if you are trading on day chart NY close - 5pm est.

6. Find a trigger - The least important part of trading - my triggers keep getting simpler and simpler.

7. Put on your trade and take your chances.  After that it’s a crap shot

8. Set and forget ( I check 2 or 3 times a day) less is more in trading

RUN RUN RUN fast from anything else

The more the tools the worst it is

Ie. More than two tools ie Macd. MA, RSI etc.

And I will tell you why because if you get complex you are fighting head to head against the super computers who work 24/7

and you will lose big 95% of the time!! And they are looking for you! People complex "up" because they think it gives them more control in fact its less.

The two things we can do better than computers are (1) simple (2) follow what they as the big boys are doing.

We cannot be the well trained bank elephant but we can be the flea on his back. ( LOL)

--- 帖子 #991 ---
\

I am sorry I missed the real meaning of your question as to stops

ok on this system I would look to stops - This is the most complex thing I do!! And that is because I see it as the most important

1. I would for at least 25 pips plus spread plus 1 pips.

2. I would look for the major swing on the 4 hour (or the smallest time frame) this is a bit subjective.

3. I would watch what was going on, on the two higher time frames day and week.

ie. If you have a major swing of 10 to 20 pips more on the day or week rather then the 4 hour, I would use that.

5. Last I would keep an eye on the whole numbers ie. "00" and "50"

ie. in an uptrend I would not put the stop at 1.004 rather  I would use 0.9995

I hope that helps

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Thank you teb for still being on this thread after 5 years. Your reply influenced me to trade with the 4hr chart instead. I was going to try this on the 15 min chart because I was obsessed with scalping, but now I see that:

1) Higher time frames are more reliable (as someone said anything below is pretty much noise)

2) More time to plan the trade. I can also concentrate on other things rather than constantly checking the market.

3) Spread becomes "smaller" as TP and SL is bigger for the higher tf, hence odds of winning is more even. It also means I can trade lots of other pairs, when previously I only looked at pairs with max 2.5 pip spread.

I can't wait to try this tmr...I see that USD/CHF is primed for a setup.

Once again, thank you!

--- 帖子 #993 ---
I hope this is right...

I think you are good

--- 帖子 #995 ---
I am quite thrilled to find that my entry, SL and targets are the same as yours. Even our broker is the same. First target just got hit

May I know though...did you purposely waited for price to retrace to the resistance candle's close? I got in at 1.3485 too but probably would have gotten in at 1.35 if I had seen it earlier. I suppose I shouldn't be trying to enter near a round number...

--- 帖子 #996 ---
congrads!!!!

No not really

the really nice thing about the 4 hour and above TF

most times you get lots of time to get in

retests and ranges around good entries

whole number thing I am more concerned about SL and Targets rather then enteries

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Hi Zaven!

If it's not too much to ask, could you tell about how intensive you've been testing Teb's system, and - most interesting - how much trades do you have with it on average? Like 1-2 a week? Or like 2-3 in a month?

--- 帖子 #998 ---
I traded this system for 3 years when I 1st started

now I only trade it when strength/weakness  is not working

ie, summer xmas

other wise I really so not use tools

tools are like training wheels

when we 1st start we need them

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Are u saying you are primarily trading relative strength now and only trade the 200 EMA system occasionally? Any words on the strength/weakness system vs. simplest system?

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
I just got here Pip...hope you would stick around cause it seems kinda quiet in here...guess people don't like simplicity

I am also concerned with the frequency of trades...but this is my first week and already I've taken 2. That is a massive amount for me. 8 trades a week, if it can manage a good win ratio with the 2 targets teb uses it would mean some serious percentage increase in capital every month.

Speaking of trades, here's another one that hit first TP a couple hours ago. I hope it's actually valid and not me being lucky...

congrads!!!

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
thank you teb! The trade is going strong now but should I leave it open over the weekend if it doesn't reach the 2nd TP in time?

edit: 2nd TP got hit but I would still like to know

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
That's cool! What pairs are you trading? There was a list of 7 somewhere in a thread.. Anyway, good luck to you, let's see what new week will bring us

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Thanks for reply, TEB! I agree with Zaven - it's great you still answering the thread after all this years. There's a lot of abandoned systems on this forum, we're lucky you keep updating this one

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Please ignore my last post...I see that teb closes his trades before the weekend in page 1 lol...how could I miss that...

Oops there's a list? Lol I'm just taking those that look good without lots of wicks on the candles, and those with smaller spreads.

I see that EU and the brother pair UCHF are good for a setup...waiting for 1-2-3 to form...

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
That's OK, he just wrote something like "all pairs with eur, us, and JPY + gbpcad" or something like that.

There's probably a GBPCHF setup on 15 min (don't know if I'll be at my pc to take it).

BTW, I see usdChf you mentioned  - it's going above ema, on 5 min. Didn't noticed anything on EU yet...

Good luck!

EDIT: I also eyeing EUR/NZD m5, it probably wants to return above ema...

Another EDIT: I think NZD/USD 5m is firing off right now, but I'll pass, as it's still a couple of hours left before the trading-tranding time.

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
ooh...im oni looking at the 4hr charts for now pip...it really is safer and more reliable. But the setup you've shown does look good...I might look to enter a small amount

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Normally I also prefer to look for W-D-4H combo, glad you are also a big-TF-surfer!

So, now I see this EU setup, is this what you've been talking about(pic)?

EDIT: good thing I was not in this EURNZD 5m, seeing how it went lol

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
I think it's time to set pending stop on USD/CHF(4H)...

EDIT: although SL would be 130pips, I'm not sure I am ready for this heh

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
U go for long or short as there is no 3 , like 1-2-3 setup .  Like to know please

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Pretty sure he's going short.

The Leg going from the last two fractals towards the black line is 1. The leg going from the black line towards the last fractal is 2. Just waiting for the price to go lower then the black line.and off we go..

But then again, what do I know..

Dutch

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Yes, you're right, Dutchy, - sorry, I wasn't specific enough, guys

Now the setup is complete (pic)

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
No worries!

Did you take it?

I went Long EU at 1.3566

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
I am in that one too...looking strong...

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Hi Traders  ,  Which TF is the best for 1-2-3  ,  i use all on weekly as its makes no noise and more accurate ?????

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
On demo Interesting, how much time it will take for this tale to unfold...

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
always the higher the TF the more accurate

ie. 1 2 3 on a week will be right over 85% but you might have one trade a year

on the 5 min likely less then 60% but you might have 2 trade a day

but if you are doing a 1 to 3 RRR even a 1 to 2 is great

1 to 2 RRR lets say  10 pips   = you would lose 10 pips make 40 pips = 30 pips

1 to 3 RRR lets say  10 pips   = you would lose 10 pips make 60 pips = 50 pips

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
TEB63 ,  Yes i will stay with weekly ,  Thanks

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Teb, could you eleborate on this? A Risk Reward Ratio of 1:2 should be risk = 10, reward = 20 = double up on hit.

1:3 = risk 10, reward 30 = triple up on hit.

Where do the 40 and and 60 pips come from?

Regards

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
3 trades

2 wins  - 1 loser = net pips

Winners  2 x 20  = 40 pips
losser     1 x10 = 10 pips

= 30 pips

etc

Was suppose to come down , Then it goes up ,   Where have i gone wrong , Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Was suppose to go up , But it goes down ,  Both on live charts .

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
ok the 1st one was too far away - never buy after a big buy  what for a retracement

the 2nd you took the wrong way

go with the 200 and you want  slope on it on the 200 it will be a small amount

also all the extra just confuses have just what you need nothing more on your charts

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Oh i see ,   Okay  Thanks .

Hello Teb and everyone!  I ran across this thread whilhe I was on deployment, so I had time to read the thread and when I got home, give it a try for myself.  First trade using the World's Simplest System.  I took this trade off of the M5.  I havn't modified my fibs yet, but I already hit 1:1 on this trade.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Heres one that I am looking at today.  Pending order on AUD/USD on the H1.  Its way below the 200ema on the H4 and the D1.  I have tried to set up my fibs, but for some reason just can't figure it out.  Although, I do know how to figure out were to take profits.

EDIT:  Ended up heading the other direction.  Canceled my pending order.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
so nice!

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
I couldn't remember where I saw this before but am glad I found this thread. I'm going to read back over it at the weekend. Thanks for documenting.

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
I hope it works for you

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Currently watching the GBP/USD on H1.   I have a pending order set.  Looking at the D1 and H4, price is above the 200ema on the H1 (Pic Below), price is below the 200 (purple MA) and looks to be forming a 1 2 3.  Still havn't figured out how to set up the fibs to show my TP, but looking at 1.6398x as TP1.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Nevermind, this thing dropped like a rock!   Canceled pending order.

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
I made with this strat +100% in last 4 weeks.(2%Risk)  W1/D1/H4/H1 and without TP. THX TEB!

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
This is a very interesting thread to follow and I will do just that but it seems the thread is getting quiet lately. Hope to try out this strategy next week and maybe make it part of my trading strategy.

Cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Teb just want to say thanks ... i go with your thread and find my mistakes  ! thanks a lot mate .. i hope i am going to make loads of pips

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
this strategy is fantastic on the 4hr, success rate is between 65-85%. However I have given up on the 15 min, it really is a mess for me.

do you have any other strategies to recommend, teb? Cuz on 4hr I only see 4-5 solid setups per year on each pair

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Looks good! Nice thread! Nice system! Thanks to TED!

My humble question:

Shall we draw S/R lines from the higher TF before we trade/entry at lower timeframe?

I didn't notice any SR lines being draw by TED, but I wonder is that important??

Thanks. And TEd are you still trading this system or you have other now?

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Hi ted, how you are doing well..

Here my second question on this system, hope I get some answers...

My observation:

Sometime even though price are above EMA200 for Week and Day chart, but you can see they are moving downward to the direction of EMA200.

And in 4Hour price is below EMA200.

In this case are we still 123 pattern uptrend follow your rule?

If we trade 123 to the upside, sometime our entry not hit, sometime our entry got hit but immediately turn to losing trade (M double top pattern)...I try to place my entry a few pips away from 100%fib but most of time it will get hit (by a long tail candle) and turn to lose after that...

am I missing anything?...

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
....I still hope to get my questions answered...please..

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
This sounds good but I prefer to trade using strictly support and resistance. I notice that the daily levels high and low when broken are very important. How do others feel about this?

Clifford

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
1 2 3 on the 4 hour going the wrong way would kill any possible trade set up for me

I hope  that helps

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Hi TEB, Can you elaborate further?

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
what are you asking?

if I see a 1 2 3 4(break) happen in the reverse to my trade on the 4 hour chart I would get out of the trade,

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
its a 50ema on the 4 hour is like 200 on the one hour

so I just have the two on one chart for scanning

( hour and 15min is the same)

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
I know this is an old thread but I had to try this and think the newer members should take a look on it...

s @ EU 1.09196

lets see what this tiny sized trade will show us... :-)

Thanks TEB for this inspiration...

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Also here a really perl!

I trade this with H4, D1 and weekly.

For enter i not using Fibo, i have for that S&R indicator and stoch (watching divergence).

Also included, but not needed, i use zigzag, 3 level zz semafor, fractals, tdi (easier for me to spot turning point - like the visuals )

Like it beside SMA 5 (Shiift 0) strategy from Bk8 for my longterm needs.

For scalping i have a similary system like your trend trading method.

Thanks for sharing it.

Greetings everyone,

Are there other traders still trading this strategy? I read through quite a bit and I like it. It's quite simple. I plan to demo trade it for a while.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Ive been trading forex for 15 years and MA indicators are one of the best indicators to use with proper analysis and price action you will have a winning system

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Hi Michael,

Can you plaese show us a few examples of how you modified this strategy using your indicatior and Stochastic?

Many thanks,

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
