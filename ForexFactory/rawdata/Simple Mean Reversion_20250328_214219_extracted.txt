Hi, and thanks for stopping by! Regardless if you're new or old member of the forum, keep reading here and I promise you will not be disappointed! From my point of view this thread is the natural continuation of the thread "Higher Edge within a Single Candlestick ” and here I intend to share with you some of my discoveries regarding this concept. As I commented in the original thread, I believe that we can create and apply multiple strategies only by using the information which is present inside a single candlestick. However I want to distance myself from the candlestick as a tool simply because we do not need candlesticks. I think they are just unnecessary distraction. We are going to focus on the raw data. That's why I want to concentrate and to bring to your attention the concept of the natural trading cycles . Primarily the daily cycle and to some extend the weekly cycle. Later in the thread I will attempt to explain the relationships between time and price which exist inside each trading cycle. These relationships are the foundation of the strategy which you are going to learn in this thread. So, let's get started! First if we want to have clear understanding, we have to define the main terms. Time! All times in this thread are based on GMT+2. This is my time zone and also the unofficial time zone from which we determine the start and the end of each day on the Forex market. The majority of the reputable brokers use GMT+2 on their servers. So 00:00 on GMT+2 is exactly in the middle of the most inactive period. (After US close and before Asia open) This is the start of the daily candle. What is " trading cycle "? It's very simple. The trading cycle constitutes a fixed period of time during which we have mostly uninterrupted trading activity. Each cycle is separated from the other cycles by a period of time with very low or no trading activity. On the Forex market we have only 2 natural cycles. Daily and Weekly. The daily cycle starts at 01:00 and ends at 23:00 each day. The weekly cycle starts Monday at 01:00 and ends Friday at 23:00. In our strategy we are looking at each cycle as independent event! High and Low . When I say high or low, I mean the highest or the lowest price of the current cycle. Range . The range is simply (high – low) for the current cycle. Mid - this is the middle of the range. Or, mid=high-(range*0.5); Or (high+low)/2; sqrt(t) - This is the square root of time. For now we don't need this. But we're going to use this calculation later in the second layer of the strategy. (Where we add some more complicated optimizations). So let's get down to the basics of the strategy. I use the daily cycle, but you can apply the same rules to the weekly. First we create the framework. For simplicity in this example we assume that the cycle starts and ends at 00:00. So let's imagine a rectangular flat plane. The vertical dimension is a variable and it's determined by the price. (The range) The horizontal dimension is fixed and in our example is equal to 24 hours. With this plane we continuously track the location (the coordinates) of the current price, the high, the low, and the middle. Here you can see one very common example of completed daily cycle. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice that we also track the location of the current time in relation to the mid cycle. In the base model we use 12:00. Later when we apply the second layer of the system we can shift this value back or forward in order to optimize the strategy. The location of the "middle" of the cycle in part determines the aggressiveness of the strategy. The further away it is from the start - the higher the risk. From this will emerge all kinds of implications in terms of the probability distributions. (I will explain the mechanics later) Now let's see how we can utilize all this information. Keep in mind that later we can modify some of the parameters for better optimization but the main structure of the system always stays the same! Here are the basic trading rules. I explain only for SELL position. The BUY is the same but inverted. We split each position into multiple units. The positions are build using inverted pyramidal structure. We build the position by "scaling in" UP TO the maximum size. (Not on top of the maximum). The maximum depends on account size, risk appetite and a few other things. 1. Initial signal. (If there is no open position) We SELL 1 unit when the current price is equal to the highest price for the current cycle AND the current time is below the mid cycle. (In our example before 12:00) 2. Secondary signal. (Position build-up). If the current price is above the previous entry price + X, then we add 2 units . X is a variable which we determine with optimization. As a standard in the first layer we can use 10% ADR. In the second layer we can add nonlinear calculation with sqrt(t). But for now we don't need this. You just have to understand the basic structure. So with this system we build inverted pyramid. Initial open 1 If the price is above 1+X then we add 2. If the price is above 2+X then we add 3. We can keep adding until we reach the maximum position size. 1+2+3+4+5.......... 3. Position Close. If we have open position and the current time is before the mid cycle (12:00), then we look for correction to the mid range. (50% retracement from the high) If the current time is after 12.00, then we look for 25% retracement from the high. In the second layer we are going to add more precise and continuous calculation using nonlinear formula. For now it's not necessary. Regardless of the outcome during the trading cycle, ALL positions are closed at the end of the cycle. I our example at 00:00 or at 23:00. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok. This is the foundation of the strategy! Even with these simple rules, this strategy will generate at least 85-90% profitable days. Or 9 out of 10. Average RR on trade by trade basis is above 1:1,5 (or closer to 2) and win% is over 60% for sure. But when we add the second layer with all optimizations and more precise calculation we can bring the success rate up to 98%+ profitable days. Here you can also download the indicator which tracks the cycles. It's very useful tool for visual/manual backtesting. At least I use it a lot.

Can you please refine the rules? At the first tick of the day the price is the only one. We have price=highest=lowest=mid. If I mechanically follow the rules: I have no position open AND the current price is equal to the highest price AND the current time is below the mid cycle =&gt; According to rule 1 I shall open a position. Now I have an open position AND the current time is before the mid cycle AND the current price is equal to mid range =&gt; According to rule 3 I shall close the position! Obviously my example is stupid as it is a degenerate case but a minimum time after "open" (origin of the box) and/or minimum range may be necessary especially because the origin is at a time of lowest volatility where the range will stay tight for some time and the low liquidity will make the price cross the mid several times quickly.

You are on the right track this system is the genesis of a worthwhile journey. PM me and I can share my notes on analysis of a single daily candle and the cycle or phase each forex pair exhibits daily. Roy

--- 帖子 #7 ---
You answered your own questions! Of course that we need minimum range. This is part of the strategy but I left the details for next posts. (I can't write long posts now) After all we try to capture only 50%(max) of the range during the first half of the day. So for example if we have range 5 pips it does not make sense to open position because the maximum potential profit is only 2.5 pips. This is why in the second system layer I use sqrt(t) to determine optimal entry points. I have this calculation in graphical/visual form as well. I will explain these things later! You will see how everything fits together when we add automation and when we diversify the system to run simultaneously on large number of markets. It's the real deal! With the right tech this system can turn into high frequency profit monster! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am playing with this system now, I really like it. When there are no strong trends it'll perform very well. I am thinking that to open a trade, the current range shouldn't be lower than 50% of ADR. Or the lower the current range, the bigger TP level, which gets lower through the time. The 25% retracement are really smart thing. Some of the trades today: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looking forward how to add sqrt(t) to this.

Hi AlphaOmega, This strategy I have worked for last 3 years. The optimized use of this strategy require some particular Technical conditions. I have optimized it to reach to 50% level at least of the range. It needs somewhat different rules but of course based on this basic strategy you have explained here.Be alert, Taking into account only the Time block and Daily price range can easily flush-out the account. Even a couple failures will lead to margin call as there is no limit on how much price can move against you before the end of the time block. But for sure if you can combine the technical analysis also you can find good strategies. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi AlphaOmega and thanks fort this strategy. What is going to happen if the market make a huge move in one direction and doesn’t come back? With this pyramid system, You will probably have a lot of positions in loss. You can see this condition twice in Your screenshot in the initial post. I think it would be hard to recover from those big losses...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Yep. This is pretty much the only potential flaw of the system. The week spot. The Achilles' heel Every system has a weak spot. That's why the whole development of this system is concentrated on different methods to reduce the impact of these undesirable fat tails . The good news is that almost half of the fat tails are caused by economic data(news). And most of these news are known in advance. They are scheduled in the economic calendar. So right from the start we can program the system to avoid almost half of the dangers. And we are left with the other half. If we find effective ways to reduce the % of losing days down to 4%(or less) - we can have relatively stable and extremely profitable system. (Fully automated)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
What can we do, apart avoiding the news, to reduce the losing days. With those losing trades, the risk reward would be pretty low

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Great thread and thank you for sharing all your hard work. I have been playing with the indicator and remembered a while back, I did some research on when Hi or low of the day is formed and found from LO it’s normally the first few hours. Having gone through your indicator, I can see that if there is a low or hi just after LO and it come back through the midpoint then we can expect the overside to be formed. So, if we have a low after London open then it passes through the midpoint we can expect to see a hi form, most time of the same distance. Just a observation looking forward to learning more on this thread

--- 帖子 #14 ---
You guys are avoiding high volatility periods. I am the person who can't wait for such days because making profit is efortless then. Thank you for sharing but imho there is no edge in such system. It would have very high drawdown. The only way to make profit here would be managing to withdrawal earnings before the stop out happens.

Hi! In threads "Quantum London Trading" by mer071898 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=551382 and "Q A M Trading Strategy" by Masterrmind https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=580721 guys did a lot research regarding to such trading style. Masterrmind says in his first post: Initially only 2 currency pairs EURCHF and EURGBP will be traded due to their common 'turtle' like behavior. EURCHF WILL BE THE ONLY PAIR traded at the start. EURGBP will be traded at a much later stage. TRADING WINDOW Asian Session initially over a 6 hour trading period Start Time = Tokyo Open End Time = Frankfurt Open Following it can help to avoid losses caused by trends. With regards, SP

Parisboy can you post your template/indicators plz? tnx

I've traded reversion to the mean systems for years and even developed a very robust trading application around the concept years ago. The way to get around long trends is multiple time frames. For example, if trading intraday charts, verify the intraday mean against higher a higher time frame like the 4hr or daily. More often than not, there will be confluence between lines across time frames. IE the mean on the Daily is the +1 or +2 on a 15 min or 30 min. etc. One of the things that can happen is that the mean can be trending upwards steadily and price will just keep going up at a steady pace hugging the mean. So ideally, you only take trades at the +-1 or beyond in the direction of the overall trend. IE buy at -1 or -2 in an up trend. As tempting as it is to sell +1 or +2 and target the mean in an uptrend, it's risky. So either decrease trade size, or only target the next level such as go from +2 to +1 and keep it tight. Price might not reach the mean. But the mean can catch up to price, if that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Dear Alphaomega, Thankyou for sharing your strategy, I love your concept as I developed and use a similar one that ignores the use of midlines. The position build up is a really clever way to scale into the trade and I am glad it is not martingalily, but linear. Now with the fat-tail days, is the position build up that detrimental that the 60-98% accuracy gains are so impacted? I am slowly learning to code in mq4, so that I can test my solutions for the fat-tail distribution days. Wish you all the best and happy trading, Tzamo

Here's a trade I did late in January to show a simple reversion to the mean (and then some). http://content.screencast.com/users/...0Jan.%2025.gif Using a lookback period of 2 days, price was huggin the mean (blue line) in an uptrend. I waited for price to dip to the -1 or lower area and went long when price dipped down to the central pivot which was also the -1. Initial target being the mean area and aggressive target being the +1 which was also a pivot area. Here's my old application with multiple time frames. The main thing with the old system was channel direction. Below the mean was a buy zone, above a sell zone. So I'd basically look across the numbers on the right and see what the colors were to know what zone price was in across the time frames and go from there. For example red (sell) zones on the daily and 4h, and look for price at the top of 15 min channels for more precise timing. This next screenie shows price coming down off the top on the daily, 4h. When price was at the top of the 1h and 15 in a down channel, that's the sell. All of the numbers on the right look like a mess but once you know what to look for, it would be easy to see the confluence across price levels. https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...3&amp;d=1190030361

for me it looks like you are drawing square of 9 roadmap chart http://www.tradingfives.com/square-of-nine-in-excel.htm

Initially I had the same thoughts. But my back-test results show that there is no correlation between higher and smaller time frames. Or in other words, it does not matter if we trade with or against the trend from higher time frames. In fact when we add information from other time frames or from indicators we get very bad results. More "filters" = bad results! This is very counter-intuitive and initially does not make sense. Right? But I trust my tests! I don't trust opinions. Not even my own opinion. That's why in the first post I said that we have to look at each trading cycle as independent event . We don't look at history! We don't look at other time frames. We don't look at indicators.....We don't look at news. We only take into account the current raw data. High, low, Range, Mid, Time, Current price. That's it! Keep it simple. Nothing else. Maybe only in the second system layer we can use daily ATR values for optimizations. That's all. In this strategy timing is the most important thing! We only open new trades in the first part of the trading cycle. The shorter the first part the less risk there is. And we have much smaller chance to get a hit by fat tail because almost all of the fat tails happen during the overlap EU-US. Once we are past "midnight" on the cycle clock we enter into management/close mode only. This is critical! The other thing is diversification! VERY important. We have to break and spread the trading volume into many instruments. The more markets we trade the safer it is. The performance of the system will improve as we increase the number of markets. Ideally we have to trade simultaneously at least 10-15 uncorrelated markets. This way even if we get hit by fat tail on one market the loss is usually compensated by the other markets. When we trade uncorrelated markets, it is very unlikely to experience big losses on many markets at the same time. The results are balanced at least 99% of the time. This way we get smooth equity curve. Without big fluctuations. To understand this, You can imagine extreme theoretical example where we can run this system on 1000 uncorrelated markets. This is will be pretty much bulletproof strategy. Almost impossible to lose. Unfortunately these uncorrelated markets do not exist. And even if they did we still need tens of millions$$ to start.

Let's see if my timing understanding works. It should be time-price unity now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The problem with this, that the price can slowly go up, without 25% retracement, and be with time unity. But at some point the daily range limit will be reached.

Hi, cool topic, I´m in. Would it be possible to create the indiacator for a broker who runs GMT+1?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
1. Initial signal. (If there is no open position) We SELL 1 unit when the current price is equal to the highest price for the current cycle AND the current time is below the mid cycle. (In our example before 12:00) I take it 12:00 is local London time 12:00 pm. If not kindly tell me what is 12:00 in local London time. Love you. thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #34 ---
My trades from this morning, little different but as said before using your cycle indicator to determine either the low or high of the day from Frankfurt, once we break the midpoint and work out today. Took a 1:1 risk reward but as you see we could have got three time that... This is a live example on one way to use your indicator

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Problem is : each trading cycle is NOT an independent event. Looking at this example , you can observe the effect of what Jim Hurst calls " the Underlying Trend " The Underlying Trend is the Sum of all Cycles whose Periods are longer that the period of the observed Cycle Let's consider the Envelope 32 TU - blue The Measured Move = The distance in points between the last significant Bottom and the Last Low of The Envelope 32 TU is around 650 points This represents the effect on Price Action of the Underlying Trend of the Dow (within the parameters) As the amplitude of the Envelope 32 TU - blue - = 2 x 62,5 = 125 points, we can conclude that the effect of the Underlying Trend Price Action on the UP Trend (+ 650 points) is roughly 5 times more important that the effect of the Envelope 32 TU fluctuations (+ 125 points)

That is just about the same thing I did last night! I got out a bit early but same idea. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I added the sessions indicator to tell me when its OK to enter (Blue square area) and where I may want to be cautious about entering (maroon square area). Beyond the squares, no new trades will be opened. Also, the white horizontal line is the daily open line indi. set to start at GMT+2

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi alphaomega I might be jumping the gun somewhat here.but using that daily and reducing down in time periods with a simple calculation you are able to determine the extended range and more importantly the price levels at which time and price converge with order clusters . Maybe you intend to touch on similar with the time sq. If I'm taking this off track that's fine and will continue as a silent observer with great interest Regards

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Fact is I do no trust your opinion ! I will not use the EURUSD because as it is traded day and night EURUSD most often FOLLOWS its averages (32, 128 or 256) I will use the German DAX because it is not traded at night ..... as most indexes, shares, financial instruments. Does the DAX sleeps at night ? during week-end ? during holydays ? NO Hence after the close, X hours after the close , at the Open we have a GAP. UP or DOWN Here we have a GAP UP of + 113 points (night shift effect) Then Price Action returns to its previous average - Chart is self-explanatory

I trade something similar on EURUSD..

Not in that chart. I do my Gann stuff quite differently than the tradingfives guys. (I know their stuff well. Been trading Gann almost as long as standard deviation channels)

Sorry mate, but I didn't understand why the position when the final rally occured shouldn't be opened, following the system rules. It's a new high, I should place a sell order. Am I missing something? Thanks again

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You can take that trade if you want, but according to system rules, it is more risky since it would be taken after the mid cycle (12:00)...therefofe it is not advised. Btw, great thread Alphaomega.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Ok thanks. This evening I will perform a complete backtest with historical tick data and I will later on share the results to have an idea...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
@alphaomega Why close at the 50% line? Looking back to Jan 8 of this current year on the EUR/USD M15, the price has gone back to the open line (the point where it was at exactly 00:00 on GMT+2) on a quick count about 39 times out of 41. Presenting an opportunity to make more profit most of the time. Thank you for sharing your system. I too am following with interest.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes there has been plenty of research in the mean reversion space applying Quantum trading concepts and building up cycles of trades either in a constant lot or progressive lot sequence however the DD has always been a key issue. Mean reversion tendencies on turtle pairs among others are common in the Asian trading session where price will move away from the daily open price in a certain direction over a number of pips only to later return to the daily open price. The EURCHF pair is a great example of this type of PA. Having a good idea of the expected trading ranges within a given trading session or preferred part of a trading session assists in knowing when its time to think about exiting a position since extended trends in a given direction accelerate DD and lead to huge losses based on the trade setup margin. One idea is to apply a hard stop just outside the typical average trading session ranges. Waiting for price to revert to the mean or to a preferred price level is a dangerous practise after average ranges have been exceeded based on experience and historical testing of plenty of data. Huge account balance with small total position size can weather many storms in the market in a mean reversion strategy but there will always come a time when price simply continues to trend heavily against your position(s) and puts a huge dint in your account balance. An effective exit strategy is the key to success but it is not easily found. I am keen to see where AlphaOmega takes this thread since the concept interests me. Masterrmind.........

I did some stats on this. There is no timing analysis in this. 10 years stats. Minimum range to open trade = 30pips. If you take trades from 0:00-11:59: *95% that the range won't be 2 times larger before 25% retracement occur.(It means if you enter trade at 30p range, the 25% retracement will be before 60p range 95% of time.) *the trade gets 25% retracement in 2 hours 94% of time. *Problem: max range before 25% retracement is 8 times larger.(It means if you enter trade at 30p range, the 25% retracement will be after 240p range.) Probably it was some news. If you take trades from 12:00-23:59: *93% that the range won't be 2 times larger before 25% retracement occur. *the trade gets 25% retracement in 2 hours 76% of time. *Problem: max range before 25% retracement is 8.5 times larger. So you can see here, everything is pretty much the same, but if you take trades in the first half of cycle, you get your TP quicker.

Hi! Thanks for the stats! Is it correct? If pair is moved away 30pips from Daily Open, then you open the reversal trade SL30 and TP7,5 pips and winrate is 95%? Kelly criterion will be here 0,75 ( Holy Grail for sure). May I ask what pairs you tested? SP

--- 帖子 #50 ---
The pair is EURUSD. The stats are correct, but you must think deeper. The SL will be the same, so yes 30p. But TP target will change, when the range changes. So TP will be from 7.5(30p range)-15p(60p range). So if range will be 59p and you get 25% retracement, your TP will be negative.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
thank you for the file. I did some tests as well. Below is Eurusd test from January 2015 until now on a 10.000$ account. 0,01 lots were used. It looks promising, but like it was already mentioned, diversification amongst more pairs and bigger account is a must, or sooner or later it will go downhill fast. DD for this test was 57%, which is way too much. So maybe limiting trade units for opening new trades could help...or even adjust mid cycle to the left. (10:00) for example. On the other hand, I did the same test for Eurusd, but this time with 1000$ account....and it failed. I am looking forward of the second part of the strategy and square root logic, seeing the whole picture and possible adjustments. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes your points are correct. What is interesting is that if you analyze the results in details, you will find that the system fails only a few days each year. And almost all of the other days are profitable. For example on EURUSD from Jan 1, 2017 - up to now there are only 4 big losing days. The last big losing day is Nov 14, 2017. Without these black swans we have smooth sailing.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Excellent Indicator and Strategy! I'm using and getting a good hit rate! Could you send the indicator buffers scheme? I would like to develop an EA with this indicator. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
So as you say - if you cast a wide net the baskets should take care of those few bad apples which are not likely to happen across the board. Sweet!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Just pay an attention the max DD almost equals the annual return. It is slightly over, actually. This is caused by the equilibrium, I suppose. To lower the DD, you can start with 100k account, instead of 10k, trading the same values (0.01 lot), but then the annual return of ~4.5% will be big enough, if trading is just for a hobby? I think CP should have said a word or two about the Hs/Ls in general, but surprisingly or not surprisigly maybe, CP mentioned nothing?!? Well, in this situation, I can advise you, driven by the collective brain power to start digging into that direction?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The indicator is not necessary. I use it only for visual back testing. (For confirmation) For the EA you only need: current price current time daily high daily low daily ATR. Everything else is simply derivative from the things above. If you code with mql4: Inserted Code double price=Bid; int time=Hour(); double high=iHigh(Symbol,PERIOD_D1,0); double low=iLow(Symbol,PERIOD_D1,0); double range=high-low; double atr=iATR(_Symbol,PERIOD_D1,20,0); double retr50=(high+low)/2; double retr25sell=high-(range*0.25); double retr25buy=low+(range*0.25); double addstep=atr*0.1; double minRange=atr*0.1; That's all you need. And from here you can modify the parameters and you can add other variables.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
You are right. DD almost equals the final return. Increasing the account size is ok and would lower the DD, but it's just a bandage for the strategy or "escaping the problem" in this case. I would focus more on filtering those bad spikes and close them sooner - limit the opening of new orders. So, Alphaomega suggested to play out this strategy on uncorrelated Fx pairs. I don't say, we should just put it on a net of baskets and let it run. Choosing the right Fx pairs is one of the keys here for this to go better. So I did that. Below is a quick test of three, uncorrelated Fx pairs; Eurusd, Usdchf and Usdjpy. The same period was selected: 2015 - Present Account size: 10.000k Lot size: 0.01 As you can see, we corrected the DD. (Relative DD, for all three pairs is now 27.47%)....so, all I am saying is playing this out on uncorrelated fx pairs makes more sense. But for further optimisation, we would need to hear further logic.

u are worng, this three are in fact correlated even eur/usd can be correlated with gbp/jpy (at macroeconomic level) plenty of smart people are doing this mistakes, just make sure that u bett small. and another thing that everybody should be aware: using mt4 for backtesting systems its a joke.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I understand what you are trying to say. They are, but they aren't as well. If you take for example Eurusd and Usdchf, the correlation between those two might even be positive if you look at short enough time scale. But further out we go, more stable are the correlation numbers. For example weekly correlation numbers between those 2 pairs might be around -80%. More you will zoom in, all the way down to the tick charts...more chaotic will those numbers look like. Regarding the strategy, I don't plan on trading it. As it is now, it is far too dangerous for my taste. And I am sure, the strategy wasn't even fully disclosed. regarding mt4 backtest; I know, I know they are a joke.....like I said those were just some quick tests, of testing multi currency idea and not much more. But isn't it irrelevant? You can do all those backtests on a super quantum computer if you want....they will still be, just some backtests.

Read the thread only superficially! Wonder if the black swan can be mitigated, with a hedge, locking the position in a "specific" span. Then, wait for the next opportunity, and use both (long an short ) as part of a new campaign, as opportunity arrives, with the same system. I use Oanda , live in Europe, you can hedge as much as you want, you can see both lots open on the same chart. It´s a way of giving your failed system, on that day, a (hopefully) better chance tomorrow. I understand those ocurrences are seldom. Just my humble 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
This sounds like a recipe for a disaster... For so many years here, no one ever described a proper hedging technique. You must double or so the proper direction lots and when the rate turns around into the direction of the black swan lots, which are the trouble ones, close the hedging lots and open them AGAIN into the new direction (the black swan lots one). That is more easy said than done, cause one needs an exit plan and very very good signaling system for a direction change. The other option would be to just close the losers and open net lots and harvest the trend and then the new trend... Most often I do this, but it is far less profitable than the first option. Hedging is not complicated when you have a nice signaling/exit system, but most traders do not have such, cause thinking is hard and why make life complicated?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This system indeed is a very good system if combined with technical analysis. You just need to have a mechanism to exit and technical analysis sound enough to retrace the price to 50% at least. It can be applied on weekly also. There are systems with 98% win ( specially position building systems) but can drain your account in a single failure. This is the problem with most of the learners that they jump in and declare a system Holy-Grail once they hit a couple win trades. Forex trading cannot be a profession until you have experience of at least 10 years with good knowledge of all technical and fundamental effects. But a very good time pass if experimenting bizarre systems. just my experience. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It is important to check the price inclination in this system, so I suggest, buy above 33.3% and sell below 66.6%, to ensure that we will have the established trend!

I see. There is possible to go with grid EU DO 1,2400, price goes up 30 pips. 1,2430 sell TP 7,5 SL 10 1,2440 sell TP 10 SL 14 1,2454 sell TP 14 SL 6 1,2460 sell TP 15 SL 2 Maximum DD is 36 pips with trading costs. With 95% win rate is Kelly criterion still 0,5 even if your average win is only 4 pips. Open trade is always closed, when there happens 25% retrace between 1,2430 - 1,2460. For example, it can come down from 1,2437 to 1,24277 (25% from 37 is 9,25) Profit will be 1,2430 - 1,24277 = 1,3 pips trading costs extracted. Can it work? In 95% cases trade result is starting from BE(minus trading cost) and going to 25% of full retrace TP. Grid is not ideally composed, because it does not cover trading costs when going to BE.

There can be some missing trades. These missing trades are the ones, which doesn't get retrace until the end of the year. It shouldn't be more than 5% of these results. But these trades would have range extended more then 2 times, in other words SL trades. I will do the same stats with continuous flow of data, that wouldn't be those missing trades.

Dear IenDzi, Could you describe please the way how do you got the result above? In range between 30-60 pips return 25% happens with 95% percent of days. Or did I understood something wrong? With thanks, SP

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I coded a system on tick data. Entry conditions: Range &gt;= 30pips. First entry is only from 0:00 - 11:59; Second entry is whenever the range extends. 1. Entry at new high/low; SL at 1.66 * range; TP = 25% retracement; 1p = 1usd 2. Entry at 1.33*rangeBefore1Entry; SL at 1.66 * range; TP = 25% retracement; 1p = 2usd; 1p spread; AccountBalance = 10000usd; Date: [2004-2017] Trades:15891; Account balance from 10000 - 16703; It is 14 years data stats. The money management is very simple, it's not even money management. But it's easier for me to see the stats better. When you look at all 14 years stats, it seems that results are good. But when you split in years, you can see that strategy works very well until 2011. The balance went from 10000 - 25100. And from 2011-2017.12 the balance went from 25100-16703. And it is more than a half of previous years profit. It's not the first time that I see this. I backtested my created trend trading system and the results were the same. It's interesting for me, what happened at that year. What i see in the chart in 2011, it seems that ranging/change of trend starts at that time. My previous stats were from 2004-2014 years. So from 2014-2017 the stats should be worse.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
First trade always be at 30p range. Then I measure the range until it gets 25% retracement. So the afterRange can get to infinity if there is no 25% retracement. So 95% of trades will get the 25% retracement before afterRange/range &lt; 2. When the retracement 25% occurs, the trade cycle starts over again. Waiting for a new high/low. Now range can be 50p ,100p ... infinity. And it trades until the time limit. AlphaOmega said we should trade until midcycle (12:00). The trades per day has no limit, it can go to infinity. So I measure the range before trade, the range after trade and the duration to get 25% retracement hit; The stats were 2004-2014 year, EURUSD. We need timing, without timing there is no edge here. Or a very smart money/position manager: a hybrid which trades trend system with this mean reversion system. I hope it is more clear now. Best, IenDzi.

Seeing this much of discussion on this system I wanted to post my analysis here with same system but not on daily time block. This has no time block instead has price action probabilities. Time block cannot direct any price change at all.But the basics are mean reversion itself. trend lines may not be accurate but correct approximately. The main focus is on price mean reversion. A bit out of my experience Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What is the name of the indicator in green and orange? thank you

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Very interesting Alphaomega. As a proof of concept this works. The statistical edge is there, it needs fine tuning for full auto though. This requires stringent downside control. Success rate, pip count are totally irrelevant for this concept. DD and XX% profitable days are robust measuring criteria. Looking forward to seeing your views and application of the sqrt(t) concept, that I have incorporated in my toolbox - and EA - since 2014. All the best and happy trading to you. LuXing

Hi alphaomega Very nice method... Just a question about the entry...do you wait for the end of the candle ? if yes, what TF ? Is anybody creating an EA from indications post # 56 ?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
This grid is not working, because trades from later needs multiplied lots and it increases too much risk. We are building a next perpetum mobile here. This thread is an excellent continuation for Merlins Amazing strategy thread https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=405 Rgrds, SP

--- 帖子 #88 ---
This is not the complete system yet. There is no edge in price itself, I've done lots of analysis in that. Lets wait for sqrt(t) implementation.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
alphaomega can you explain the rationale behind the 25%? Yesterday I took a pen an a paper and wrote down what happens if the price goes straight in one direction in the first part of the cycle. At 25% retracement the grid is in loss. Shouldn't the 2nd retracement be at least 33% (= BE)?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I think, it is because wicks are 25% of candle range.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
These inputs are not fixed and as I said we can modify the numbers later. We can also add smooth continuous calculation. For example at 00:00 we start with 100% retracement target and as the time progresses we reduce the target accordingly by using the sqrt(t) until we reach 0. Because at that time (00:00) we have to close all positions anyway. But for some reason during back-testing I get the best results with 25% retracement after 12:00 and 50% before 12:00. Here is the rationale as far as I understand it. Because the strategy is based on fixed time cycles, we have to find the optimal ratios between time units and price units at any given time. BUT, because the system is trading mean reversion logic, we also have to optimize the win%. This is where the edge comes from. Basically this is the exact opposite logic of trend following system. (With trend following we try to maximize RR). The key here is to try to get rid of all positions as early as possible. For this we exploit the natural mean-reversion properties of price which tend to be much more prevalent in the first half of each cycle. For example if you have position at 18:00 it does not make sense to target 100% retracement. The win% is just too small. But 25% retracement still makes sense. Because you have 6 hours left. I hope people can understand the logic here. It's just too difficult to explain this stuff. lol This strategy is just a starting point and I want to keep it as simple as possible. I want to show people alternative ways of thinking. And from here everyone can develop different versions.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Furthermore, it's not the same entering a trade at 5:00 than 17:00, I mean, I've also discovered with hundreds of trades, that depending o the hour of the day, the trade should be last longer than other opened at a differnt hour. In fact, I optimize the expiration time of a trade depending the hour of the day..

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes this is part of the "secret" knowledge about trading. Timing is the key! Most successful discretionary traders often learn to do this type of calculations intuitively as a result of long experience (trial and error). With the strategy here we can see different optimization examples and target settings. The examples below are for short positions. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #94 ---
In post#7 alphaomega shows a chart with a visual representation of the diffusion process (the sqrt thingy). To scale this parabola I wanted to use an estimation (forecast) of the volatility. I use the realized variance of the previous days computed from the 1 min returns (no GARCH stuff). I took the opportunity to do some stats on the variances split by day name. I expected to see that a Friday and a Wednesday had very different average variances. I got surprised by the result. The average variances are the same but the variance of the variance is much higher for a Friday than for any other day. =&gt; it is harder to forecast next Friday's variance than next Wednesday's one. This hints not trading this system on a Friday as part of risk management. Note: I only performs these stats on EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I tried to add an estimation of the trend too (I'm not claiming I succeeded here!). Originally I wanted to see if these "volatility cones" can help recognizing quickly a bad day. Look what happens when the price escapes the cone in term of retracement. Problem: At the early stage of the cycle the cone is so small that the price always leaves it. (adding an offset?)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Thanks! There is still a lot of work to be done until the system is refined enough to trade larger live account. On the entries I personally do not wait for candle close. Maybe we can add this option as additional protection against fat tails. But I'm not sure how the results will change. I already posted automated EA with the basic version of the system, here . You can test it on demo or small live account.

This system has no edge. It simply adds to losses until it reverts back to the mean. You can go broke waiting for it to go back to the mean. IF you used this trading bitcoin where is there is no defined cycle you would lose your money. Parabolic up and parabolic down.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
In the case of fx we have clear cycles with respect to time: in this case, timing is our edge. As has been stated, there are days when the cycles don't follow the pattern being exploited - but to our advantage, they are few.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
It's the "secret" sauce, you have to have patience You can calculate the projected volatility bands by yourself. It's very simple actually. Take the 20 day ATR. For each band/level divide the ATR value by the corresponding number from the standard Fibonacci sequence: 34, 21, 13, 8, 5, 3, 2. Project the levels from the daily open price. For example the upper levels are calculated like this: level_1=open+(atr/34)*sqrt(hour+1); level_2=open+(atr/21)*sqrt(hour+1); level_3=open+(atr/13)*sqrt(hour+1); level_4=open+(atr/8)*sqrt(hour+1); level_5=open+(atr/5)*sqrt(hour+1); level_6=open+(atr/3)*sqrt(hour+1); level_7=open+(atr/2)*sqrt(hour+1); ................... The same is for the lower levels just use (open-). I use these levels as filters in order to reduce the number of signals. This way I can scan 20-30 symbols. For example I take contrarian positions only if the price is above level 4 or level 5. And the current time is before 12:00 Stop loss at level 6 or 7. This is what the levels and signals look like: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Wooh Were these formulas created by you and pictures too ? Seems really good filters...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thank you for the updated information and your 'volatility' formulas. I'm not sure how your approach would survive an aggressive trending action by the market as it appears your only escape from a losing cycle is closing all trades at the end of the daily cycle by which time the losses could be rather large based on the trade dynamics and ultimately the sum of all trade outcomes and the daily range covered by the symbol at that time. Another issue I see is defining the entry time of Trade 1, perhaps not so much the timing as to the movement in pips from the daily open price. Most likely setting a minimum X%_ADR or minimum pip (eg 20 pips so that a 50% pullback still yields approx 10 pips) movement of the given symbol will resolve this easily enough. Sell Trade would consider High Price-Daily Open price whilst a long trade would consider Daily Open price-Low price. What would be useful here is your trade entry setup (entry, SL-fixed or dynamic and TP-fixed or dynamic) examples showing both a hindsight and before the fact series of trades throughout a full daily cycle. I'm assuming that for a daily cycle of trades that entered positions would oscillate between shorts and longs based on the PA and entry criteria of a given symbol. An extention into multiple symbol trading comes to mind rather quickly and reminds me of the Quantum trading approach where short positions are opened as price breaks higher or long trades are opened as price breaks lower usually via candle close (any preferred TF). Numerous entry criteria has been used to 'tame' the frequency of entries including but not limited to X_candles, X_pips, various other indicator parameters and many more. Perhaps your approach might offer an effective exit strategy to 'control' the evil DD beast which surfaces from time to time and destroys an otherwise great equity curve. As always it appears that one does not exit and only a very large account balance mated to very small position sizes and applying a hard exit strategy such as %Equity_SL may work over the longer term. I currently see good and bad in your current approach and I know you have not yet revealed the entire strategy. The good comes in the form of day end trade closures which provides a limit to the daily carnage if things start going pear shaped. The bad comes in the form of having several trades open in the market and no real exit strategy if trend is strong and pullbacks are minimal (&lt;50% first half or &lt;25%/33% second half) and the entire cycle of trades could end in loss. Nevertheless, I remain interested at this stage and look forward to your future posts. ps. I hope you do not take my comments the wrong way, they do not mean to offend, not at all, rather I tell it as I see it using constructive criticism. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Masterrmind, trades are not left open till the end of the day: stop loss at level 6 or 7.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
That is for contrarian trades what about the 'standard' type trades. Quoting directly from Post 1 the Thread Op states: " 3. Position Close. If we have open position and the current time is before the mid cycle (12:00), then we look for correction to the mid range. (50% retracement from the high) If the current time is after 12.00, then we look for 25% retracement from the high. In the second layer we are going to add more precise and continuous calculation using nonlinear formula. For now it's not necessary. Regardless of the outcome during the trading cycle, ALL positions are closed at the end of the cycle. I our example at 00:00 or at 23:00 ." Perhaps clarification is needed. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #113 ---
A question about the volatility factor: is it ADR or ATR ? just for clarification @ alphaomega.. could you post your volatility indicator # post 108 ? Many thanx and congratulations for your system.

ADR (average daily range) is the same as ATR (average true range) for the daily chart.

from my understanding, we only do contrarian trades here: sell when price rises through level 4 and 5 above the median. buy when price drops through level 4 and 5 below the median.

Perhaps in time we will see several trade examples posted by the Thread Op. Before the fact trade setups work best for me but certainly multiple examples of trade setups are a key part of showing the method. Masterrmind.........

I agree, it's a simple reversion to mean strategy, which works best in ranging markets and fails when the market is trending. This is why i believe it works best until daily mid point (12:00).....before the overlap of LO/NY. Since ranging market is one of the cores for this strategy to work....why not applying the strategy in asian session instead? I think I will do some further tests.

dear alphaomega thank you for this nice thread. may you give one example of this description? may you provide the indicator of the picture above? is there the calculation due to the ATR ? Best Hundsbua

--- 帖子 #120 ---
At first, great thread! My idea which can help to reduce toxic trades is, to open only one position/candle or open only one if the candle is "larger" then the atr. It can help reduce floating loss if there is a breakout.

been testing this vigorously for a few days and it always results in account blowing up at some point. unless the creator of the system has a way to mitigate a one way market this system will never work. i think you can take some risk off with tailoring around news events, but that alone will not cut it. the only option is to cap the positions it takes i presume and that could be tested if it was an input in the EA..can you add that to the EA ?? looks like thread is dead so i'll leave it at that.

I'm still struggling with the second bullet "after 12:00 looking for a 25% retracement from the high" Now, since positions may only be entered before 12:00, this 25% retracement from a post-12:00 high may be well in the negative, right? EDIT: To illustrate a bit, here's a screenshot from a day gone bad for the system: Provided there would have been an entry level for the last bar before mid-cycle, there was never a 25% retrace from high in the second half of the cycle (colored in red). Even if there would have been, the exit would have been above the last short entry.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
In my opinion, the system works like this : 1) You showed an entry at 1500 hrs. This is forbidden according to the system rules. No entries after 1200 hrs. 2) Now,let us suppose, this entry was before 1200 hrs. This entry is NOT the highest high at that moment, but must also obey the condition : ShortEntry &gt;= Level_4, where Level_4 = Open+(atr/8)*sqrt(hour+1) Afterwards, the trend was against you. Well, in that case you run into your stoploss. Which is defined as : Level_6 = open+(atr/3)*sqrt(hour+1); where atr = daily average range over 20 days. For EURJPY this results in around 100 pips at 1500 hrs. You calculate it at the moment, you take the trade. From then on, it remains a fixed Stop Loss price. 3) The 25 % retracement level for your Profit Target must also be calculated at the moment, you take the trade. So, your intended exit is never above the entry price, but always below it. (In case of an initial short trade). 4) if you show a chart, please show the price axis also. That makes it easier to discuss targets and stoplosses.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Er, no - 15:00 is arbitrary - it's the civil time according to the broker's time zone. The system rules exclude entries after mid-cycle, which the OP calls 12:00. You will notice that my day starts at 03:00, the forbidden zone at 15:00 accordingly. The supposed entry is in the 14:45 bar. That's why I said *if* there was an appropriate entry level. In the first post there was no "Level 4", and in particular no SL mentioned, these came later with the sqrt(t) rules. I agree that introducing SL will change the picture completely, in particular whole "look for a 25% retracement" scenario becomes largely redundant. However, as long as there's no SL but only the 25%r and close-at-end-of-cycle thing, there will be plenty of days as the one shown where the system runs into deep problems. Now that's something interesting where I think the rules are actually not clearly defined by the OP. Is the "take profit at 50% retracement between 00:00 and 12:00" always referring to the current mean level, or to the mean level at the moment the trade was entered? To me the first seems to be the case, as shown in post #30 . The close for the two sells is indicated on the current yellow line, sell1 is thus closing in loss, only sell2 is in profit.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I hate reading tea leaves and that is exactly what we are doing here so far. As the system was explained and which I've read several times this system reminds me of a chase betting system. You can win 50 games in a row (per series 7 game chase) and lose just one chase and most if not all the winning games are gone. As the way the system is now and the very limited EA inputs the OP has provided I would recommend NOT TO TRADE this system right now. Hopefully the OP will get serious with this thread because I have some ideas and input I would like to provide, but I will wait until system is revealed.. So far everything looks good accept dealing with fat tail days and sometimes weeks... could blow up your account very easily.

I copied the indicator for Pineview. For the interested: You can play around with it here: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/EU...-Range-System/ You'll quickly find that, at least as initially described, it has more days with problems than not.

The screenshot says alot. This is the typical behavior that is something mean reverting traders attempt to avoid at all costs (DD escalation !). As I've mentioned many times, there appears to be no hard and fast strategy to overcome this evil DD except a hard SL or close at Time_X. I was hoping on a more productive and faster discussion with the Thread Op however, it appears at this stage he is far too busy to get involved. I'll move on for the time being and continue with my own projects but I'll drop by now and again. Good trading, Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Exactly ! I have always been fascinated by the concept, and have tried several things to try and mediate the huge DD issue it always faces. I trade it but use a very tight SL on trades that go do not retrace much. So far i have not found a real good solid edge with the system. Interesting to see the second installment of the system because i have struggled with DD on this approach... green pips !

Just to add ... The global ratio similar to those you mentioned. From my own research I've seen one number occuring over and over again ... What is the probability that a bar has the same color as its preceding bar? What is the probability that a ZigZag repaints? What is the probability that a 5-chunk of candles fulfill the 5-linear subsequence theorem if the previous 5-chunk doesn't fulfill it? The answer is always close to 52.5 %!

Thanks AntiCre. Hope you are going well. I know you have a immense aptitude of analytical research mindset in you. I have to agree on your first point. I was being liberal with the 46:54 split giving some room for margin of error. Mine also tells me the real truth in trading that no one wants to accept. There are millions of binary conditions that could occur and no matter what strategy we deploy on which market condition, the probability will almost always fall within the 48%-52% win versus loss. That is why my Challenge to the trading community is still not broken. "A trading strategy that purely relies on price:time series on just one chart (one pair and one timeframe) will not survive more than 3 years". 3 Years is somewhat arbitrary to eliminate the human luck factor and to incorporate discipline in execution with discretionary style. There is not a single automated strategy that can last for 3 yrs in retail forex that is based on one chart one pair one timeframe. It cannot exists because if it were to exists, market will seize to exits and that will be the demise of the entire trading industry (which has started on a false premise and will continue the 'system' of brainwashing retail trading young and old to fall prey on their marketing promise. Feel free to prove me wrong. Use any tools, objects, indicators, candle formation, price action on a two dimension chart with price over time. There has to be atleast ONE external factor introduced in the strategy for it to succeed. Depending on a price or time derivative is just not enough. On your second point, I don't even understand the meaning of "repainting" of indicators as I am against using them... even for ATR. They are just illusion causing roadblocks or obstacles. I will leave the 3rd point for others to comment :-

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Well, they are measuring tools. A ZigZag is basically designed to identify breakouts. You see how people fool other traders. Moreover, there are only a couple of real indicators. For instance, ZigZags are the same as Stochastics, the same as Semaphors, Cycle Identifier, Williams % R, Donchian Channels, etc ... And the most crazy thing is that they have different standard settings. Who wonders that they give different signals?!

Hallo veefx, Your comment has been awarded the title of "complete bullshit" and has nothing to do with the original intent of this thread. Please, do not disturb an ongoing discussion with items that are irrelevant to it.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Would you agree that any system strategy is doomed for failure in the long run if it is designed to handle only certain market conditions? Example: if a fat tail in your example is a dooms day scenario, no amount of filtered can be applied on price or time or any combination there of to avoid the dooms day. Probably Yes. "On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero" Would you agree that any "optimization" based only on Price is a flawed strategy in of itself? I don't know. Would you agree that price will always diverge or revert from mean or whatever level 100% of the time? No. The price does not move most of the time. Would you agree that trades taken on divergence alone will yield close to 50:50 win/loss? it's more in the range of 46:54. No. (Other factors in play) Would you agree that trades taken on reversion alone will yield close to 50:50? No. (Other factors in play) Would you agree that market does not have a contract with Price to stay within a range or to conform with ATR/ADR? Yes and No. Would you agree that bi-directional trades taken on both diversion and reversion will increase your win/loss ratio? No. Would you agree that uni-directional trades taken on both diversion and reversion will increase your win/loss ratio? No. Would you agree that uni-directional trades taken on divergence and countertrend trades taken on reversion will increase your win/loss ratio? No. Would you agree that unidirectional trades taken on reversion and countertrend trades taken on divergence will increase your win/loss ratio? Maybe. Would you agree that bidirectional trades taken on both divergence and reversion would increase your win/loss ratio? No. Would you agree that bidirectional countertrend trades taken on both divergence and reversion would increase your win/loss ratio? No.

How is it possible that your average profitable trade, with a lotsize of 0.01, is $ 11.64 and your losing trade - $15.48 In general, the width of a trade is 25% to 50% of the daily range. That means, with your results, you have a daily range of 232 or something like that. But in reality the daily range is much smaller. For eurusd the ADR = 80 pips. So, profitable trades should be between $2 and $4 on average.

Here is an excel file, you can use for calculating the distances, at which point to enter a trade. You have to enter in the beginning of the day : a) The Open b) The dailyrange = Average daily range over 20 days c) alfa = a percentage . It is fixed at 10 % at the moment. This % is taken of the dailyrange. ==&gt; ADR = alfa * dailyrange. Per hour is calculated the lower range and the upper range. Upper range = OPEN + ADR * SQRT(hour) Lower range = OPEN - ADR * SQRT(hour) This gives an easy worksheet for the day. Here you can quickly check where price has to be at a certain time of day in order to enter a trade. The current excel file has the data for gbpjpy of today. The open was 150.16 and the average daily range is 1.197 (119 pips). alfa = 0.10 This results in a lower boundary of 149.74 at 12 o'clock. Price must be 149.74 or lower in order to buy this . But it did not reach this level, so we do not buy at the moment.

VEEFX; there is one strategy that meets your criteria above; and it's been working forever; market making. liquidity providers (including banks) have been doing it since the inception of the markets. their strategy only cares about current bid/ask, and upcoming news events (where they reduce their risk exposure). Having said that; you do have a point in having a strategy not lasing more than 3 years. This is because to succeed in systematic trading; you need to adapt; and improve the strategies all the time. In 3 years time; the strategy is still running; but because of the improvements made; it is perhaps not regarded as the same strategy. The edge is still the same however. It is either: - momentum based (aka trend following) - mean reversion - market making CP for example; uses momentum. (tips: His strategy will NOT work on pairs other than GU)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
VEEFX, this is for you. Once I have prommissed to you, to show you how to spot a range? Can you recall that? Unable to share a chart now. Some smart wolves sniffing around here. I will just simply describe it. In a strong trend, the price does not brake previous/last top/bottom. Range is opposite to that. First range sign is a false break of an opposite top/bottom. More of that follows shortly after. You are in a range now. I hope you will appreciate my honesty.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Most of your questions have unclear definition. My initial assumption was that by win/loss ratio you mean gross profit divided by gross loss. Also known as profit factor . If this is the case then my answers remain as they are. But if you mean percentage (%) of profitable trades, then the answers will be yes. BUT again, with the assumption that all trades have equidistant fixed stops and targets. Otherwise you will get different distribution. However under this condition the reasons for the placement of the trades is irrelevant. Regardless of the strategy, IF you place random trades in all directions you will get random results. Period. (50:50)-cost. No escape from this!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I have found, for myself, trading is a game of: Tops Center Bottoms Plenty of pips, when avoiding the Center. Center is aligned with timing. Everything Starts and Ends in the Center. The only way to survive, in a long run, is to learn to avoid the Center. The Market Makers want you to trade in the Center. Center is their best interest and best friend... This is quite practicle opinion... I hope it helps. p.s. Everyone has to find the answer of “How?” for oneself’s.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
the six dimentions thingy is an over kill. when you enter a trade; the market can go in the direction of your trade, against it, or dont move. 3 possibilities only. keep it simple. once you open a position; exit at a profit, and if the market goes against you or nowhere exit at a loss. period.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yes I agree. It's even simpler than that! Trading is just a sequence of binary choices (Bets) under different conditions. For example: if (trend == true) choice 1 = bet on continuation; choice 2 = bet on reversion; if (trend == false) choice 1 = bet on Up Trend; choice 2 = bet on Down Trend; And you always have choice 3, the safest bet - Do nothing and wait! You can also trade exclusively based on expectations and fundamental information. Without technical analysis. But this is another story. Lets just stick to the topic.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
you are missing a point in the probabilities; consider the following scenarios: 1. EURUSD has moved up by 20 pips since the day open; what is the chance of the price going up or down? is 50/50 2. EURUSD has moved up by 150 pips since the day open; what is the chance of the price going up or down after that? it's certainly NOT 50/50 probabilities change over time; just like the roullette' probabilities change after a long number of plays (refer to CP's post on roullettes) the point is to identify an edge. In the example by Alphaomega strategy; we use statistical edge. We calculate the average daily range; and enter when the price has exhausted its daily move (measured by the ADR)

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Some people will argue that this is a classic case of Gambler's fallacy However, I'm not completely convinced about the validity of this theory in the context of trading.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
that is the beauty of Forex compared to Stocks; it tends to have more rubber band effect. EUR/USD for example; never doubles in value; nor drops 50% of its value. It will remain within a reasonable value for a long time. compare that with S&amp;P price, or Facebook stock price; which tends to go upward over time. A Forex pair; is already a pair of two currencies; (EUR, and USD), you are trading the difference (aka the spread, in pairs trading terminology). Statistically; you do have an edge already; it will mean revert more than trend. You just have to cater for mean drift from time to time; due to macroeconomic/news events. During those times; stay aside if you are not in; or exit if you are in a position.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Your are right, except that you have missed the part, of that being a multi currency back test for 3 pairs at the same time (EURUSD,USDJPY,USDCHF)...which should clarify your questions.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
correction to my previous comments above; I just did a statistical study on EUR/USD and GBP/USD; and found out that: regardless of the current price in relation to the day open; the probability of the price moving in the same direction; or retracing; is indeed 50/50 in other words; whether the market moved by 20 pips above the open; or 80 pips, or 100 pips; the probability of the market continuing in the same direction; or reversing; remain at 50/50. the study I performed is from 2015 to date; using daily candles; and also using London session candles.

Hi Riverstar, Above of all, sorry for not explain it clearly, and thank you that you have tried to give me a clue, but ... it is not about pythagoras. My bad is not to read alpha's posts clearly before i ask, so this leads to misunderstanding ... ... Trying to read and Understand the contents first, then i will ask again if i find some thing not clear ... Time is limited at the moment, so can not explain it much, hope you can understand it ...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Maybe you should extend your statistical study to a few more years back, because it is a little flawed in my opinion. If price travels 20 pips is not the same with it traveling 40 pips and is even different of 100 pips. The distinction between them is a very thin line and if not looked at it carefully might at some point resemble Gamblers Fallacy. The reversion to the mean or diverging away from the mean is pretty complex and should be treated as such. There are simpler methods of trading for those who do not posess very well established statistical, mathematical and trading knowledge.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Hi All! I am not sure i understood this strategy, however i will write as i get it: The heart of the strategy is the assumption that prices tend to reverse to mean price. Therefore most of the trades are profitable. The heart of the problem with this strategy is the bad days, when you open many trades and they all go to loss, which make a very great loss. But if you take off the greed from the game, and never open too many trades on one day, you will still be profitable on most days, and also the bad days will not be so bad. For example, you can decide that in your first trade of a day you risk only 1% of account, second trade another 1%, third trade 1% and that's all for this day. On the worst day you will lose 3%. If there are many days of profit, this will not destroy your profitability. Regards, Avraham

--- 帖子 #158 ---
hi Avraham, OP in the second strategy is talking about only taking 2 trades: buy on level 4 and 5 below medium, sell on level 4 and 5 above medium. stop losses on level 6 and 7. so even better with only 2 trades.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
''Trade Small, Trade Often, Cut your Losses Short, Hold Your wins just a tiny bit longer (via Law of Averages and Large Numbers) is the only 'edge' I could quantify from the market.'' Perfect advice. I would also add Trade What You See, Not What You Think.

Great thread. I have a few questions that I was hoping OP could help answer: 1) Are there other ways to determine the start/end of a cycle apart from the hours? (Or would 00hrs-23hrs the "universal cycle"?) 2) Are some cycles longer/shorter in certain pairs compared to others? How would you determine this? Sessions, maybe? Overlapping sessions maybe? 3) What are your typical drawdown percentages like?

Hi! I would like to ask about the time GMT+2. I downloaded history data from tickstory without shift of time and put it into MT4 without shift. What i got is that at most of the year the trading week starts at 21:00 and ends at 21:00 and a little part of the year starts and ends at 22:00. and the days monday and friday are partial days- less than 24 hours. When i put the prices in MT4 with shift of 2 hours there is something strange. For H1, at summer the week stats and end at 23:00, and at winter 00:00. But for the daily the day always starts at 02:00. What should i do?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi! Another question about the GMT+2: I put in the data as i described at former post. And added indicator TM_DRS (by jensitzig). Since the daily starts at 02:00, the day of the indicator also starts at 02:00, which is not the start of the trading day. May someone help? Thanks, Avraham

--- 帖子 #174 ---
There are only 2 kinds of shift. First brokers with GMT time without shift (very easy because it's the standard). But kkep in mind UTC will be shifted 1 hour when daylight saving is on in europe. The other brokers have GMT+2 to achieve that the "trading week" starts monay 0:00 and end friday 23:59. Then we have the 2 weeks when american daylight saving is already on or still on and europe hasn't daylight saving. Then all brokers shifting 1 hour that the american session of friday ends 23:59 this comes with the problem that the week starting on sunday even for GMT+2 brokers. That's why i normalize all my time information in the programs and always calculating the higher TFs from the H1 data. That's the only way to have the same calculation between GMT or GMT+2 brokers. The shift will be also calculated for every week, fortunately there are fix rules for the daylight saving in europe and america. Inserted Code datetime getEUDSTStart(int year) { // DST starts last sunday in march MqlDateTime mqlDate; mqlDate.year = year; mqlDate.mon = 4; mqlDate.day = 1; mqlDate.hour = 1; // UTC=GMT mqlDate.min = 0; mqlDate.sec = 0; datetime dstStart = StructToTime(mqlDate); int dayDSTStart = TimeDayOfWeek(dstStart); if (dayDSTStart == 0) dayDSTStart = 7; dstStart -= dayDSTStart * PeriodSeconds(PERIOD_D1); return dstStart; } datetime getEUDSTEnd(int year) { // DST ends last sunday in october MqlDateTime mqlDate; mqlDate.year = year; mqlDate.mon = 11; mqlDate.day = 1; mqlDate.hour = 2; // GMT+1=UTC mqlDate.min = 0; mqlDate.sec = 0; datetime dstStart = StructToTime(mqlDate); int dayDSTStart = TimeDayOfWeek(dstStart); if (dayDSTStart == 0) dayDSTStart = 7; dstStart -= dayDSTStart * PeriodSeconds(PERIOD_D1); return dstStart; } datetime getAMDSTStart(int year) { // DST starts 2nd sunday of march MqlDateTime mqlDate; mqlDate.year = year; mqlDate.mon = 3; mqlDate.day = 1; mqlDate.hour = 6; mqlDate.min = 0; mqlDate.sec = 0; datetime dstStart = StructToTime(mqlDate); int dayDSTStart = TimeDayOfWeek(dstStart); if (dayDSTStart != 0) { dayDSTStart = 7 - dayDSTStart; } dstStart += (dayDSTStart + 7) * PeriodSeconds(PERIOD_D1); return dstStart; } datetime getAMDSTEnd(int year) { // switch 1st sunday of november from DST MqlDateTime mqlDate; mqlDate.year = year; mqlDate.mon = 11; mqlDate.day = 1; mqlDate.hour = 7; mqlDate.min = 0; mqlDate.sec = 0; datetime dstEnd = StructToTime(mqlDate); int dayDSTEnd = TimeDayOfWeek(dstEnd); if (dayDSTEnd != 0) { dayDSTEnd = 7 - dayDSTEnd; } dstEnd += dayDSTEnd * PeriodSeconds(PERIOD_D1); return dstEnd; } I hope the explanation helps you to understand the problem and the code snippet could help you writing a script to fix the problem,

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi! After my 2 last posts: it is very interesting. In both cases: when i put in the prices without shift and day started at 21:00, and when the day starts at 02:00: well, in both cases i see the same: when price arrives at level 4 ( and even when it arrives at level 3 in a very early hour of the day), it usually reverses towards the open price. However. it is just first observation, not backtesting.

Thanks for your reply. I don't know to read and write code. However, if you calculate from H1, i don't understand why do i get the start of day at 02:00 in your indicator?

Hi Jagg Tested DSR v1.2 but in the calculations there are some differences. Other levels and different 100% value see screenshot (didn't find how to insert img in quote). I'm using the version form alphaomega ? Erik

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Yes, I show 0,25,50,75 and 100% values because we look for trade closure at 50% (and 25% after 12 o'clock), so for me these are the levels I want to see (not 16,33,...) (regarding the different 100% I have no clue, look if the 100% line is really on the day high!?)

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Please don't waste your time with the standard buffer draw examples of MT. They are not implemented in MT4 but will not cause the compiler to show up an error. I believe they are implemented but as empty methods or something like that. Regarding my library i will not disclose details here (and not in private chat). I have worked on it for more than 2 years and it's to valuable for me. Since it's unique i have some customers wh hired me because of it. And as much as i like to develop it further with some members here, i don't want to feed the 95% of users who only steal and collect.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You have added a lot of value to the indicator. It also shows your clarity of thought. Have you coded any EAs? I can give entry logic. Exit logic has to be your indicator's.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yes, I made a multipair EA for trading this method and the EA is running in two variants on a vps to gather informations at the moment. First variant trades more or less how it is described in 1st post (with exits at 50% before 12 and 25% after 12). I only set here a min level of the ATR band of 3 to take the first trade and also a hard stop if ATR band 6 is reached. July results for this EA attached. What I note the last weeks I had a look at this simple mean reversion method is, that we often exit the trades in profit at 25/50% levels and the price goes way higher/deeper than that. So I set up a 2nd multipair EA which also has this minimum ATR band 3 restriction / ATR band 6 hard stop but don't have any fixed 25%/50% exits (except the day end close of course). This EA set a break even stop when a trade reaches + xy pips and then uses a "CandlestickTrailingStop" which sets the stop to the high/low of the last x bars of a M15 chart (+- an optional buffer of x pips to that high/low). It also only takes short trades when price is below the longer term EMA (I use H4 240 for example - optional) and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Great work Jagg. By hard stop, do you mean once price reaches ATR 6 you close all orders?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
yes... close all trades from that symbol. The "ugliest move" against our trades is coming, the question is only when (with this hard stop I feel more confident when this EA runs 24/5 in the background)

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Very nice. Can we not test the EA on Backtest. Are you able to share it yet.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The EA is not yet ready for publish. There are too much inputs in there which will confuse 90% of all people and I don't have the time to answer all that questions. I think I'll publish it in a few days/weeks

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Since it running on multiple pairs it would only be backtestable under MT5 but i think jagg has made a MT4 EA here

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yes, for mt4 but I made that multipair EA in a way you can put it in mt4 strategy tester. When doing this the EA takes not the set symbols from user input but the actual symbol from the strategy tester. Inserted Code e.g. //Allow backtesting with strategy tester in mt4 if (IsTesting() || IsOptimization()) { PairsToTrade = Symbol(); } This works for the standard method but with method 2 for example I use a MTF EMA and such things and using MTF calls on strategy tester is really buggy/not possible.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Ok, when the EA only "iterates" through given symbols and can calculate on each symbol alone, than this can be done. But if you would need data from various symbols to calculate and execute on a symbol, then we have to switch to MT5. So your Switch is the best solution here.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
My first test version still works well without any optimizations. This proves that the strategy has a lot of potential for development and the core idea is solid. But as I said in the earlier posts, the key element for the long term survival is the clever utilization of multi currency baskets. The main idea is to create custom index which has very stable ranging price action at all times. This means that we have to create a synthetic symbol which does not have fat tails. I know others have attempted to create this and failed. But still, I believe we have to give this concept another try. New formula. New thinking. Here you can see one of the unsuccessful attempts which provides good ideas at least for a start. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=262827

good idea. You can also diversify the strategy using various parameter values

This was last week running the EA's 24/5 (9990 = method 1 / 9993 = method 2 - see above for more details )

--- 帖子 #198 ---
The last week (2018.07.16 - 2018.07.20) method 1 was the better one. Friday was a really bad day for USDJPY which destroyed the overall week performance for method 2 (9990 = method 1 / 9993 = method 2 - see above for more details ).

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Once again here are the last week results (2018.07.23 - 2018.07.27). Both variants of trading this method were again green, original method was a little bit better like last week (but with much more trades taken). 9990 = my variant of SMR with 4H MA filter, BE stop, no fixed timed 25%/50% exits but "candlestick jumping stop loss" - see above for more details 9993 = original mehtod from post 1 with only BE stop added. _ EA trades the broker min lots per symbol (0.01 for forex symbols, 0.10 for dax/dow) with some small kind of martingale (0.01 for first 3 trades, 0.02 for the next two trades and then 0.03 lots until MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed is reached). Both variants open the first trade only when min level of the ATR band of 3 is reached and also have a hard stop if ATR band 6 is reached! The broker used has fixed spreads per symbol and charges no commissions per trade.

HI Jagg, I like your way of overlaying the Simple mean reversion indicator with ADR Pip scale with four markers. Being a financial journalist, I have found it is easier for me to trade on fundamental rather than any technicals. Your indicator with PIps scale is what would have helped me . Unfortunately, my neck and back took the brunt of my intense chart watching. So I have to go for an EA. My 3 years testing with EA has proved to be profitable. The only problem is I am not able to exit with profit when I am not monitoring the trade. Whenever I have monitored, the results have touched up to 50% gains in a month. My target is 80 pips a day. Maximum one position open any time. If I can hit between 4-10 trades during times when news trading is not happening, I end the day. Trading mainly during Asian hours and occasionally London hours. I am 69 and unable to watch the screen for more than 5 minutes and so I am keen on testing an effective method to exit via an EA. I will be happy to share my experience by mail if you are interested in knowing the entry methodology. I only use price action and currency strength to enter the trades and exit discretionarily. Entry logic mimicks my 15 years of chart watching and it has proved that EA can fetch better gains than the manual method. Exit logic eludes me as I am not able to convert my discretionary ways into a trading logic that can really be used by an EA. And that is what is preventing me from going live. I am mainly a currency options trader, and because of my focus on fundamentals, I depend on big picture to develop a bias for direction mainly for news trading. But momentum trading (no direction bias except for the selection of hot hours and guessing momentarily currency strength without any visual aids except eye) is the one that worked for as a manual trader. Manual exiting was arbitrary and I never maintained journal or maintained mechanics or metrics. I only maintained the mechanics for the entry logic's but never paid any attention to exit metrics. You have now provided a tool for measuring pips, is it possible for you to use the ADR scale to generate metrics linked to trading hours and size of pips to exit and generate notifications. I have never used stop loss and in case of strong reversals affecting my entries, I resorted to averaging. 10% of the times it happened. I stuck to just one currency symbol as I wanted to specialise in it. GBPJPY which can easily generate 80 pips a day in times of medium to high volatility periods. If you are interested in developing an EA I will be happy to share with you on PM

I just implemented the strategy described in Post 1 in MQL5 and did a backtest based on real ticks from 2017-01-01 until 2018-07-30 on GBPUSD,H1 starting with 2000 USD capital: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I observed that the big losses are mostly due to days that price moves in one direction. We may get better results if we can filter those days.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
So you took every trade (on every new high/low), no minimum ATR band level or something else? I try to limit the losses with the hard stop at ATR band level 6 and only take trades in the H4 EMA direction with my 2nd method (magic nr. 9990) for example. Last week (2018.07.30 - 2018.08.03) wasn't a good week for this method in general, we often had such situations where price trends in one direction the whole day. Therefore the original method from post 1 had its first red week. With my method I got still a good green week (because of Dow)! 9990 = my variant of SMR with 4H MA filter, BE stop, no fixed timed 25%/50% exits but "candlestick jumping stop loss" - see above for more details 9993 = original method from post 1 with only BE stop added. _ EA trades the broker min lots per symbol (0.01 for forex symbols, 0.10 for dax/dow) with some small kind of martingale (0.01 for first 3 trades, 0.02 for the next two trades and then 0.03 lots until MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed is reached). Both variants open the first trade only when min level of the ATR band of 3 is reached and also have a hard stop if ATR band 6 is reached! The broker used has fixed spreads per symbol and charges no commissions per trade.

nice work. can you show backtest for EURUSD on the same period?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Sure! I will post the results here.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
The EA opens a maximum number of trades based on fixed distance (100 points). I will test it with a percentage of the daily ATR value to see the results. The idea of using ATR band levels plus a trend filter seems valid to me. Good work!

As suggested by alphaomega in Post 1, the EA closes all open positions at 25% and 50% retracement depending on the time of day (one cycle). I am going to make some modifications to the original strategy. In case of any improvement, I will post the results here.

Perhaps some novice traders like mean reversion but they also might like martingale or trend trading or swing trading or any other type of trading. Certainly do not recommend it as a standalone trading strategy. Plenty of highly intelligent minds are parked in this space though.

I just read this Simple mean reversion, and i found it very very smart technique. I appreciate it. I have a good feeling about this. Now im learning how to make the right price action with this technique frequently.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Mean reversion in my experience tended to suit the turtle pairs such as EURCHF and EURGBP and EURUSD. Indeed it still might depending on the actual strategy used. If Equity is high and lot sizing is relatively small then try the volatile pairs such as GJ, GA, GN, EN etc. Here are a few key points from my own analysis of mean reversion: 1. Match the symbol against its session (does not always work out to plan but very often it does); 2. I found it very important to form an appreciation of the average trading session ranges for the symbol of interest; 3. How far price moves on average in a relevant part of the trading session (Use Excel or an indicator to record this data !); 4. Think about SD's, and placing hard stops just outside say 2 SDs or what ever standard deviation multiple you determine as appropriate; [I examine the outliers very closely here and attempt to determine their cause, the reason may not always be so obvious] 5. Be aware of upcoming news not only on the same day but the next day (avoid trading via mean reversion in this situation); [Sometimes PA will rip around and bring your cycle of trades into a major win but at what risk ??] 6. Next critical part of the puzzle is to formulate a Progressive Lot Sequence, that is each additional lot size is greater than the previous one; [Trade 1=0.01, Trade 2= 0.02, Trade 3=0.03 or non-linear approach, more risky but requires a less shallower pullback for a net +ve outcome] [You must know your average ranges and plan the PLS around it based mainly on your risk allocation] 7. SL placement just beyond a few SD's gives you some comfort but if price keeps trending, the reuslt will be a stop out; [if you trade smaller volume think about 3*SD's, make sure it fits with your risk tolerance level] Trend is your friend in the early stages but if it fails to bend then it may be the end ! What this is saying is that you need a trend to generate the entries afterwhich you need a big enough pullback in PA to exit in positive terrritory. So far with testing the approach offered in this thread I have found one pair to be the stellar performer ... EURUSD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This may not always be the case eith EURUSD and there are probably several other pairs yet to be discovered. Trading EURUSD provides lower trading costs due to tighter spread in general and if you use a H1 TF you can trade it manually. Masterrmind.............

Very interesting alpha! Hardest thing for me right now is to find a solution for run away days when price does not come back to BE even. Sometimes it comes back a few days later but there are times it takes months or even years before it reverses. What i'm trying to do right now is averaging in and get out at third step if its not profitable allready. (so trying to cut them short in a way) But as with all filters and ways to deal with losses, it will also cost winners. I hope you can give me a hint how to deal with those outliers.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
alphaomega has nailed it already with his exit strategy of a retrace of 50% / 25% depending on time of day. in my strategy above; the exit logic i am using is similar concept; a fibonocci retrace of 23% from current day range. this simple rule guarantee that you will be out on the same day. you will get losing positions and winning positions. no stop loss is used. i do not use them at all. i dont do swing trading. all my stuff are intraday. i like to sleep well and start a new day fresh. my broker wont get any swap fees from me

Time exits are also important in mean reversion. for example; for intraday trading; exit at end of day or end of session regardless of the position is a winner or not. if your TF is few days; than consider exiting at end of week. time exit is crucial to success. it is an indication that the trading decision you made may be wrong and thus we should terminate it

Hi Yonnie! I think we both did not understand the second strategy, because the heart of the mean reversion strategy is that there should be second and third trades etc and the volumes should be greater at the second and third etc. The bands are only filtering the trades, not changing the rules. However did you backtest / forward test it as you understand it? Thanks! Avraham

Or should I post screenshots of all the ~200 trade entries and ~200 trade exits my EA is doing over the week (The thread gets messy by doing that imho) To bring some value to my post here I show the trades taken by the EA for the best performing instrument last week - which was the DAX index (#9993 original method).

Last week I started working on a new improved trading model. The main concept is similar to the original but this time I'm using variable parameters depending on day of the week. I also made new management system which take into account the correlation in a basket of 5 currency pairs. After some extensive backtesting I found that Monday seems to offer the lowest risk profile for opening of new positions. And Thursday is the highest. So the same ( or similar) rules in regards to time cycles are applicable not only for the day but also for the week. However the weekly volatility is more risky. Especially after Tuesday. Part of the reason is because most of the important news are in Wednesdays and Thursdays. Today I made the first test of the new model. The initial result looks pretty good and the new model seems very stable. This is the result with low risk, no optimizations and without compounding. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

HIGLY I RECOMANDE SOMETHING REALISTIC Trading for a living: real talk; by Adam Grimes Trading for a living—this is why many of us come into the market in the first place. It’s the fuel that drives a lot of marketing, good and bad, and it’s an ideal to which many traders aspire. So let me just put the conclusion up front here: you absolutely can trade for a living. It’s possible, and many people do, make enough money trading/investing to completely fund your lifestyle and replace all other sources of income. But, as you might imagine, it’s not at all simple. Let me share a few thoughts with you. The marketing message On a very personal note, I realize that one of the mistakes I’ve made over the past decade is that I have not respected the supreme importance of marketing. I have operated under the assumption that if I produce top-quality content, good people will find my work. This is true (and, in fact, it’s probably how you found me!), but I now realize that me working with a proper marketing message is a net gain to the world—it obviously helps me build my business, it connects my work to more people who could benefit from my work, and the success of my businesses will allow me to create more content. That’s the very definition of a virtuous circle. But most of the marketing in the trading community is slimy and unethical because it is based on lies. When some guy rents mansions or cars to take pictures, or does videos by the pool saying things like “this could be your office every day while you work just 3 minutes each day on your trading”, that person is, with 99.99% assurance, lying to you. (Ironically, I’m writing this beside a swimming pool, but that’s not the point…) What they are selling you is the idea that if you buy their service you can follow their trades and own the sports car and flashy lifestyle. What is true about this marketing message is that trading can absolutely change your life and financial situation. It certainly has for me, and for many others. The lie is that any “service” can get you to that success. The lie is that you can get there by following someone else’s trades or chatroom calls. The lie is that it’s easy. The lie is that you can have this success in a few months. Yes, you may be able to achieve this success, but it will be one of the hardest things you do—it’s going to take years and it’s going to be a major focus of your life. The reality Ok, so, as they say “real talk” here. Here’s what I believe, based on nearly 25 years of experience in the market, a career of active trading myself in nearly all liquid market and on all timeframes. This is also what I’ve gleaned from knowing literally thousands of traders—from 8 figure annual traders (I did not mistype), to traders just scraping out a little bit every year, to traders who were not able to find success. Let me bullet point this and Ill expand: The path to trading success is far from certain. Starting out, your chances of success are far less than 50%. Trading success requires a significant capital base. Out of all the marketing lies, the worst might be that you can make a living with a few thousand dollars. You do need money to make money in the markets. Trading income is highly uncertain. There will be years you reap a bounty, lean years, and maybe even years you pay the market for the privilege of being a trader. Even once you achieve success, future success is not guaranteed. A lot of things can derail a trading career. I would say, to all of the developing traders who are envisioning a future where they trade for a living—one of the questions you need to be asking is should you trade for a living? Even if you could, should you? Do you really want this life? Let’s dig deeper. The path We don’t need to spend a lot of time here. If anything, my writing, speaking, teaching, has over-emphasized the negatives—the challenges, the pitfalls, and all the ways a developing trader can go wrong. Since we’re looking at reality against the typically slick marketing message of the internet gurus and scammers, let me just say this: your chances of success are far less than 50%. You must know and accept that going in, because it makes this different than most careers. If you want to be a doctor, you can probably follow a path and get there. Same with being a lawyer, or air traffic controller, or master craftsman. In most careers, there’s a pretty clear path to success. Industry stats (from brokers) tell us that between 80% – 90% of trading accounts lose money, depending on the sample. Don’t be too quick to dismiss those stats and say “well I’ll be a winner.” Maybe you will be, but you at least need to respect the fact that you are going into a situation where the cards are stacked against you. You have to respect the challenges and have a realistic view of what you need–edge, money management, capital, discipline, support framework, etc. If you respect that, you can do things to make your odds much better than the typical ~15% success rate. I know this is not in line with “the power of positive thinking”, but I also think that positive thinking and visualization can work against us in many situations. It’s not a panacea, especially if it encourages us to deny reality. Then, it’s a poison. You need money to make money There are laws of nature that cannot be broken. The speed of light appears to be one. Gravity is probably another. Risk/reward, and the somewhat proportional connection between the two, is yet another. Anything can happen in financial markets. It is possible that I can “invest” $500 and make $5,000,000. You could borrow money on a credit card and blow the trading account up into the millions. You could put all of your net worth on some 3 delta options and make it big. It’s possible, but it’s so unlikely that you must eradicate thoughts like this from your thinking. Yes, there are stories of people who have done this, so the hopeful, optimistic new trader will point to those examples and say “but it’s possible. Anything is possible.” This is true, but it also underestimates the impact of survivorship bias (and, possibly of how the markets have changed in recent decades.) If you are going to trade for a living, you are going to have to do it the old-fashioned way—slow(ish) and steady. Plan on making a reasonable percentage return on your trading capital; we can have a debate on what the number should be, but it’s far less than 100%, to be sure. What this means is that you aren’t going to open a $3,000 trading account, quit your job, and make a good living scalping off a 500 tick chart or something. (As an aside, if you’re absolutely determined to roll the dice on a tiny account, your best bet is to put all your chips on one big trade and sacrifice a chicken to the market gods. Ok, maybe the chicken won’t help, but when the odds are against you you should avoid multiple times at bat. Note that this is exactly the opposite of what a trader with an edge should do. (Except, again, maybe the chicken…)) Please don’t be discouraged by this—you can make a very solid living off a very solid percentage return on your account, but you will need a substantial capital base to make a substantial living. There’s no avoiding that, just as there’s no avoiding gravity. For the developing trader, work on developing the skills, showing the consistency, keeping your expectations realistic, and then you can address the capital issue down the road. If you have the skills, the money will come, one way or another. Trading income is uncertain Typically, when we get a job we know what we’re going to make. Even in crazy fields like finance where the bonus might be a huge and variable piece of your compensation (and your base salary insignificant by comparison), we still have a pretty good idea what your year-end compensation is going to be. Not so in trading. Some years, you’ll make three or four times what you expect. Some years, you will make a fraction of what you expect. Some years, you might get to pay the market (i.e., lose money) for the privilege of being a trader. Can you imagine a job where, some years, you might write a check back to the company? Of course not! That’s not the way the world works, but it is the way trading works. The myth of perfect consistency in trading is a lie, even for active traders. (It’s a lie sold by people pushing daytrading courses to the uninitiated.) You can tend toward consistency with active trading, but that’s also a function of leverage… which means your overall ROC will be lower… see? Everything is tradeoff. So, from a practical perspective, this means that you need to plan your trading career by looking to replace some multiple of your target salary with trading income. In other words, if you could get a job, live the life you want, and make $X a year, $X is not your trading income target. Maybe it’s 3 times X, but it’s certainly a lot higher. Also, once you do have some success, you need to think about how to plan for the lean times. Don’t spend every extra dollar you make. Don’t take out too much from your trading account to buy a car, planning to replace it with a few good trades. Psychological pressure is a funny thing, and you can easily find yourself on the wrong side of it. Planning your life A few practical thoughts here, some of which will reiterate points above. First, focus on learning to trade. Don’t even think about trying to do this for a living or living off trading income until you can show some consistency. It’s hard enough to learn to trade in a vacuum, and borderline impossible if you add the pressure of paying bills out of your trading account early on. It will take you several years to develop the skills you need, and you can’t really shortcut that growth process. There are laws of math, capital, and money, and you can’t get around those laws. You’re going to make a reasonable percentage return on your account, so you need a substantial capital base to support yourself, once you’ve developed the skills of trading. You need a larger trading income than you would need from a regular job because trading income is highly variable. Many traders find that having secondary income streams removes much of the psychological pressure of trading. I personally know traders who made millions of dollars each year for decades, who also had small side businesses that made maybe $50,000 a year, or spouses that worked relatively low paying jobs. What’s $50,000 to someone who makes and has made $5,000,000 a year each year for the past 10 years you might ask? Security. And with that security comes confidence and balance and the ability to do what you need to do as a trader. Consider how you might build an “antifragile” income from multiple streams and sources. Last, be smart. Be a good human. Do what people have done since long before recorded history—put something away when the harvest is good, knowing that there will be lean years. When trading is hard, know that good years will come in the future. Conclusion I think, sometimes in my work, I’m too negative. I portray trading as a very challenging endeavor for which few people are well-equipped, and at which few people will succeed. I emphasize the challenges and remind people of all the ways they can mess up and fail. While this is true, it’s also true that you can be a successful trader, and that success may exceed all your expectations. You can change your life and your world. You can change the world of those around you. You can make the world a better place. But you will only do that if you have a realistic picture of what is ahead, and if you’re prepared to meet the challenges along the way.

I don't have these stats yet. At this point I'm just trying to prove or to disprove the validity of the logic and the effectiveness of the model. So far it looks promising but the real stats can be obtained only with real forward testing on live data and this will take some time. However one thing is for sure. The characteristics of the model are such that the edge can be extracted only with variable position sizing + averaging/grid. So in terms of pips distance the average loss is always larger than the average profit. This however is compensated with high win% (75% +). As long as the markets are stable, this system will produce almost perfect equity curve. My theory is that it is possible to eliminate the drawdown almost completely by creating a complex basket of many different (uncorrelated) symbols. With the correct formula we create our own unique price action to fit the model almost perfectly. This theory is already proven mathematically. The hard part is the actual application of the theory. There are so many things you can miss. There is always a black swan hiding somewhere in the future!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Thanks AO. I agree on your finding on position sizing and distance between average profit/loss. I have does similar simulations and every time and effort spent resulted in validating my belief about "measuring" correlations during entries and expect those to be same or similar until exits. My view is...black swans impacting correlations happen several times every day at the micro level as part of the market design (mathematical dependance, twist and turns during volatile times. Money flow induced, market sentiment induced and many such related dynamics. This lead me to also believe that entry setup can never ever be the same as exit setup. I.e. buy on signal and sell on opposite signal. We need something else outside of price to make this work.All my effort included 28 pairs as I found majors-only to be more irratic if trading only the underlying USD.strength/weakness. Could you please share more details on what you mean by the bold below: "With the correct formula we create our own unique price action to fit the model almost perfectly .This theory is already proven mathematically. "

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I wrote a little bit regarding this concept in one of my previous posts here . (synthetic symbols) Also you can search in google for "LTCM dynamic hedging". I'm trying to study and to apply some of these old concept into my models. For the USD strength/weakness I completely agree. My basket model performs best when the USD is stable. This is why I try to avoid opening new positions on Wednesdays and Thursdays and Fridays. (Major USD news days).

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Just curious: What's your take on my latest shout out here ?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
My take is dont try to find the efficient ranging basket. if that exist, than any mean reversion strategy will work. A better path perhaps is to limit the downsize risk by parameter diversification. EURUSD is the king of mean reversion. it is the closest instrument you can find to the basket you are looking for

--- 帖子 #263 ---
You are probably right. But the idea of the "perfect" ranging basket is just too appealing to ignore. In the worst case scenario I just waste my time. But even this time is not completely wasted for me because during this research I constantly learn new things and I write a lot of new code which keeps my mind sharp and also expands my library of useful functions.

VeeFX: Binary Nature of Currency Markets Efficient/Balanced Ranging Basket for Ranging Market Efficient/Balanced Trending Basket for Trending Market Markets are efficient. There is no Edge in just Price vs time series There is no way to pinpoint when Range turns into a Trend or Trend turns into a Range Ignore Market Movements Ignore Market Conditions Ignore Price Action Analysis And Figure out a way to consider Market as Neutral. So How to create a market neutral strategy/portfolio? How to do both... generate income and grow capital from a market neutral portfolio? Possible solution: By trading BOTH Trending Following Strategy and Mean-Reversion Strategies in the same or different accounts. But how because we don't know "when" ! Here's how to determine "when" to invoke which strategy: Long-Only Divergent and Mean-Reversion in one account &gt;&gt; Trending Following and Pullback/Reversal Trading Short-Only Divergent and Mean-Reversion in second account &gt;&gt; Trend Following and Pullback/Reversal Trading For Income: Inverse RR or fixed RR for Mean Reversion For Growth/Capital Appreciation: Big RR for Divergent We fail because we do not know how to predict price We fail because we determine risk based on Price Alone We fail because we measure price distance or relative distance or correlations or strength to determine risk versus reward Remove Price from the equation and just randomly pick divergent and mean-reversion based on some simple rule because outcome of every rule applied to the market will ALWAYS remain a 50:50 probability outcome before trading costs. WTF - why 50:50? Because: Price is binary (bid/ask) One Pair is also binary represented in single price..... This is the biggest reason why no one is able to assign a tangible absolute VALUE a currency pair (Hint: How can we determine market valuation if we don't have the absolute price of a stock/pair/currency/economy?) Direction is binary (up/down) trade is binary (long/short) Market condition is binary (range/trend) Trade outcome is binary (profit/loss) Price behavior is also binary &gt; Price is either diverging from mean or reverting to mean With so many binary parameters driving a strategy, the outcome of any strategy will ALSO ALWAYS remain a 50:50 outcome. Why? Here's my challenge for those who say they have found an edge in "price action" &gt;&gt; Prove your profitable strategy can work with ANY position sizing/MM strategy. It MUST work at all times if there is a secret edge to be found in the market. As long as that edge exists, a strategy must ALWAYS be profitable regardless of trade frequency, trade mgmt, position mgmt, money mgmt, By definition, an edge in price must warrant a higher Risk to reward. Am I right ? No f*cking clue but this is what my tiny logical mind is telling me via my research. What I do know for sure is... the word "Simple" has no place in any System Trading Thread.

Can't agree more. High win rate requires negative R:R which can eat your account in one losing streak (i am not talking about HFTs here). Most manual successful systems have win rate of 40-55% and produce profit factor of 1.2-1.5 over dozens of thousands of trades. I want to quote somebody, but can't disclose his identity. Just to mention that this guy made hundreds of millions by the age of 35. "when you choose 1 THING and you do 1000 live trades and your win/take profit is 40% then you HAVE SOMETHING you can adjust your r:r to make that 40% profitable get it? trust me on this"

If you think EU is the king, then GBPCAD is probably the GOD of mean reversion. My algo trades with 99.80% hit rate over period of 10 years with static SL where the TP is 100 times smaller than the SL on average. But the TP adapts to current market conditions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A version with less filters produced 10 times more trades (which is better), but also more losses over time. Hit rate is 99.36% Attached Image (click to enlarge) These are old stats made years ago on MT4. TRD

the word "reversion" brought me here. And i have a good feeling about this.

Basket trading of mutiple instruments has the only benefit when some range, some trend and some trend HEAVY. The last make you the money, because we can only profit from the trend. Therefore imho looking at the dollar index and using that information for correlations with other pairs is wrong approach. The problem comes from "how hard the dollar affects other currencies?" The answer ofc nobody knows. So it should be better to apply the desired approach on each currency individually to extract money from the "some trend HEAVY". But you can make good money in ranging markets too. I think you are refering to such a system in your post. Because all the facts you shared match one of my algos using grid and averaging down (not martingale). Hit rate is 73%. It is using only 1 pair but variable position size, but fixed basket TP and SL. I mean basket as positions here. Grid is every 20 pips. Usually basket fails with 35% loss of the account, but it happens every 2 years on average and it needs about 2 to 6 months to recover that loss. 10 years: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It only on mean reversion pairs. It has also black swan protection naturally by putting the trades over time, not only over pips. Anyway i don't trust it much because the pair can change its behavior even after 20 years and you are dead in no time. The only advantage is that it makes money very quick. You can double the account in few months. I created a video to show how it operates, but price, price, time is hidden to protect its edge. Inserted Video TRD

I disagree about GBPCAD; it is the worst for mean reversion. have you been trading it live; or on demo? There is a big difference there. Transaction cost alone (especially slippage, and spread during quite times) will eat you alive. EURUSD is the King; and will remain the King; due to its fundamental nature. If you want to trade the USD index; trade EURUSD; it represents most of its weighting. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Below are spread and spread to average daily range statistics for Forex instruments during 2018 (January to present day): Column 1: Average spread in basis points Column 2: average spread divided by the average daily range. This is a true representation of the potential transaction cost. Notice that EURUSD is the king of them all; followed by USDJPY and EURJPY, etc. GBPCAD is way down in the list Edit: i have re-sorted the list; and included ADR as well

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Yes I agree with this information. Not sure what the other guy was on about but EURUSD is the king, no question. Two pairs I found incredibly mean reverting (most of the time) were EURCHF and EURGBP during the Asian session. An issue with trading them was a lack of volatility and a relatively high spread compared to the majors (correctly ranked low on your chart). Provided a broker could be found offering lower spread then what was commonly done was opening higher lot sizes because typically the pairs would not get too far away from you in the Asian session due to low volatility and small average trading ranges and although the pip count was small the gains made could be rather nice. However, this was usually during the early part of the trading day close to Tokyo Open with lets say about a 4-6 hour window. Often trade progression was a bit like watching grass grow. Price would head away from the DO line from anywhere between say 10 to 30 pips on average and later cross the DO line. In fact a number of Quantum traders applied this approach and I for one spent more than a few years analyzing each pairs typical behaviors. The danger as always was the rare occasion when a trend ensued creating escalating DD. Without an effective exit strategy it was a challenge to keep the Equity Curve pointing towards the moon. I like where this thread is headed. Masterrmind............

By the way, this is very very old strategy! Buy low, sell high and exit in the middle. This is mean reversion in it's purest form. Super simple and it just works. And will continue to work forever because its based on simple math.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Hi alphadude, thanks for the stats. Please correct me if i am wrong, but i am refering to price returning back to a previous exact point which also includes the mean (i guess), because the mean is nothing more than a average price calculation like a moving average. But its too limited, because it has specific params which do not consider what will happen next 1min, 1hour or tomorrow. And TBH i don't really get it, how ADR or spread has anything to do with if price will return to a previous point or not. You can't predict the daily range tomorrow or the day after or for any day. It depends on unlimited factors for example the placement of all the stars in our universe at that very day Spread can be predicted. I have a contract with few brokers that offer me fixed spread almost 100% of the time. Thats a risk a broker takes for me, for which i pay with higher spread. For GBPCAD i pay either 3 or 4 pips depending on the broker. But my system is not influcenced much by the spread. 3 or 6 pips, results are almost same. Now i realize we could have different opinions, because you guys use mathematical models to calculate price and i don't use anything like this. My algo trades based on repeatable behavior of that pair which tends to return to its original price 99.36% of the trades (with my edge) over 3600 trades taken for the last 10 years. And i backtested much more years with same results. But i find it cool that everybody disagrees with me :-) TRD EDIT: JFYI because you asked for life account, i let it trade life on a small spread betting account just for demonstration purposes. Dont ask me to prove its real )) : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi TRD, nice work there. you points are correct; and mine are too. The reason I asked you about live trading; is to ask for your experience on slippage. I have never traded GBPCAD myself. my experience live trading pairs other than EURUSD; is high slippage when you need it. Usually this occur during closing of positions; especially when the size is slightly large. In some occasions; I get slipped 20 pips and even 40 pips on pairs like AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD and EURJPY The backtest (using real ticks) shows fantastic results; yet live result differ because of slippage. Not to mention high spread during quite times. EURUSD appear to be having the lowest transaction cost; and lowest slippage of all pairs that I trade. I have recently dropped all other instruments; and I am only trading EURUSD; even though the strategy works on many other pairs in backtest. Crosses are another story all together. Take GBPCAD for example; the spread is about 4 times the spread of EURUSD. Opening and closing a position in GBPCAD will cost me 8 times the cost of trading EURUSD. We are giving too much back to the broker. I trade short term; and that requires low transaction cost. In your case; you appear to trade medium term; where spread may not be a problem.

Thanks. What do you mean by upside risk? I love equity explosions :-)

--- 帖子 #279 ---
" Would not use mean reversion as a standalone strategy " - I tend to agree with this one statement. It's possible but I wouldn't.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
One word of caution I'll give you though Mizi is be sure you have a reasonably solid exit strategy, by that I mean one that protects the loss on your account when price trends away and does not come back. The strong trend will eventually strike and if the traders mindset is something like this; "It'll be ok price will reverse soon, its always reversed for me over a hundred times in a row... I'll keep the trades running..." Then the fact is that the account will eventually end very very badly. Long term account survival depends on having a solid exit strategy, hedging approach or some type of loss control technique(s). Most traders who are committed to mean reversion or very similar PA are seeking to find ways to minimize DD and be profitable long term. In my own testing I looked at introducing multiple pairs. It is in my opinion a natural progression to want to trade more than 1 pair at a time and some simple testing indicates higher returns over same time period are very likely as opposed to trading just 1 pair (this one point here might open up a ferocious debate in itself). I was chasing 2 main outcomes in trading multiple pairs; 1. Reducing the risk by spreading margin across several pairs (Sum [Pair A floating P&amp;L + Pair B floating P&amp;L + ... + Pair N floating P&amp;L]); and 2. Increasing net gain in Equity over a shorter period of time. Eventually more than one big trend would arrive on several pairs and create a humbling experience. An otherwise perfect Equity Curve would be savagely bashed ! There are techniques however that can be used to reduce DD but I will not elaborate on them here. Mainly because of my invested time in them and the fact that they are code intensive (multiple pairs) and still under testing mode. If you trade larger TF's mean reversion can also work but you may need a much larger account balance depending on the time slot you intend to trade and your actual trading strategy especially lot size allocation and SL pips. Simply going through multiple charts of different pairs and different time slots (and/or sessions) will open your eyes to the good and the bad in terms of the PA you may encounter. Take a look at AO's Sqr(t) formulas, they are rather interesting. Traders here will probably modify them to suit their own versions of mean reversion as I have done. Masterrmind.............

Kudos for a well written post. I am a huge fan of multi-pair trading so this resonates with me. Just a quick comment on the following.... Reducing the risk by spreading margin across several pairs (Sum [Pair A floating P&amp;L + Pair B floating P&amp;L + ... + Pair N floating P&amp;L]); Even with single pair multi-position strategy, I am a firm believer that we should always base position size (for %risk position sizing) from "Available Margin". Open 1st position, x% of accountequity()...free margin depletes Open 2nd position, x% of free margin The beauty of this is a more balanced exposure and if you can visualize this, a far "optimized" use of margin..... you can literally squeeze every penny worth of free margin under a certain threshold to avoid MC. This model is far superior than a higher %risk bigger lot position sizing.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
So all hope is not lost. This post is actually a good one! I was beginning to think you had become all jaded and scorned.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
hehe... I belong to the camp of "Risk increases astronomically the moment we enter in the market". Risk is not fixed even if we measure the range/distance of price in pips. We need to do more to contain risk without dependence on price itself. Price will always go wherever the f*ck it wants to go for one pair... but price will never go up or down for all pairs. Using this method builds a fabulous cushion or shock absorbers by considering what market HAS to DO.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Good points raised here. What I was leaning towards was spreading the margin (not the risk) across a basket of trades and not just the one pair. The interesting part though is that at some stage there will also come a time when more than 1 pairs floating loss will also align with at least 1 to 2 other pairs floating loss and create a larger cycle of DD. This is accelerated (or should I say more commonly noticed) the longer the cycle of trades remains active in the market. I've seen this more than once on several test runs, demo as well as several in live mode. Regarding the higher lots, these were applied only in sections of the Asian trading session and only on certain favored pairs. So its a unique setup and certainly not to be played out in general terms or the market will eat you up. The weak link in all of this is running out of free margin (or the trader for allowing it to happen in the first place), then the choices are gone and so too the account thereafter unless the market reverses and takes away your pain but rarely does this occur. Plenty of good points raised by you though. ps. The font in red above should be re-written to say spreading the margin NOT spreading the risk.... ha ha. Masterrmind..............

Aint that one so true. Masterrmind...............

Thanks... are you a believer of "measuring currency correlations" in your trade entry decisions? Just curious because, being a non-believer of Price itself, I do not measure or calculate anything based on price. A price as a dot in infinite space that keeps moving every tick by tick simply cannot be measured or contained or captured or trapped or cornered or pivotted or fibbed or trendlined or bands or waved or... you name it.. using any calculation of price itself. So the classic problem arrives with "how to balance or select pairs to extract more when they move in our direction and protect us from drawdowns when they move against us. We simply cannot rely on correlations to contain risk as part of our portfolio basketing. It will always results in ziggy zaggy shitty equity curve imo. Any suggestions? if you have one, I will share mine :-)

--- 帖子 #287 ---
There are only 3 effective ways to diversify for the purpose of risk reduction. 1. Apply the same strategy to multiple uncorrelated markets. 2. Apply multiple different strategies to one market. 3. Apply multiple different strategies to multiple different markets where each strategy is optimized individually. I cant think of any other way to reduce risk and volatility in the equity. Maybe we can use options as a form of insurance....like alternative to disaster stops. But this depends on the strategy.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I fall under #3 with a twist. The twist being "using the exact same entry applicable to a universal principle or rule at applies to all price movements". I am also not a believer of any such thing as a "strategy optimization"... optimization by definition means you are trying to fixate a circle inside a square or vice versa.. neither the circle (radius/range) nor a square (top or bottom) can be fixed as part of any strategy parameter optimization for it to last longer so that is ruled out in my research

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi alphadude, slippage is part of the game and it depends on your size. 1 pip for 10 lots trade is nothing to worry about. If you get slipped 20 pips, then you probably didnt notice the spread which was same size or you have to double check your broker or account type. Fx is liquid enough even on retail level. "Not to mention high spread during quite times." I think i clarified that in my last post "the spread is about 4 times the spread of EURUSD. Opening and closing a position in GBPCAD will cost me 8 times the cost of trading EURUSD" That is true, however GC has unique edge compared to EU. And probably because of spread most traders will refrain from analysing its behavior. Which is good for me "In your case; you appear to trade medium term; where spread may not be a problem" It depends on the market. Some trades close in 1 min, some in 1 month. So am i trading long or short term.

Nothing new. Actually, I was completed jaded trading manually. Going to automation route opened my eyes to the world of possibilities (but still at the mercy of the darned broker) It's all included in my bookmarked (or perhaps deleted) posts in the past. read up on my "TradingCostMultiple" and many other ideas all shared throughout my journey to get the F out of here one day from this revolving door :-)

By default its set to 100 times, but because of adaptive TP strategy, the algo managed to bring it down to 40. As mentioned recovery takes 2-6 months. The obvious choice is usually wrong TRD

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I have advocated using currency correlations on entries in some strategies but not in all. I think you need to consider many other factors as well when it comes to entry techniques. Being a transparent trader I have no problem outlining a trade setup before the fact and following it through to completion. If this occurred in this thread then it would be based on at least some resemblance to simple mean reversion out of courtesy to the Th Op. I tend to use the word, confluence alot, meaning that I'm more of a trader that seeks to make an entry from an assumed higher probability setup. But I may apply a relatively high risk to some setups especially scalping type strategies where I closely monitor the SL pips as a % of account. Since I trade multiple strategies it would probably not be the right place here in this thread to elaborate on them. But I will say this, everything in trading is relative period. When trades move against us and accumulate DD something needs to happen. Either hedge, drop some positions, add additional positions apply some elaborate techniques or two or sit and hope that things change for the good. I go for the elaborate techniques(s). Using correlations to contain risk might offer some relief but it is limited in its effectiveness mainly because it can change in time and the trader might be in a period of time where the effectiveness of correlations isn't so effective and is basically out of sync. If its related to trading multiple pairs in a basket then it may have its uses but its still not a simple matter. There are numerous other competing factors at work in this space and when correlations diverge and converge from one another over time the account margin levels will also fluctuate. An immediate 'band aid' effect is to drop several opposite direction trades to ease the escalating DD but this is only a temporary measure and to be very effective the account requires plenty of free margin otherwise its usually a less than favorable ending. A worthwhile exercise is to intentionally run a demo account or more into serious DD say over 50% and then attempt to recover the account. I wonder how many traders have tried to do this ... you will learn an incredible amount in a very fast time. I believe there is a way to smooth out an equity curve but as I've mentioned in a previous post I'm not going to divulge it. Testing continues and in any case I've been working on it for a very long time. The greater the number of pairs the more one must rely on an automated approach because I've tried it in manual mode and its a beast to handle. I would certainly be interested in your ideas about controlling DD in multiple pairs or singles for that matter but not sure you'll share it since I'm not about to share mine. I am willing to drop some hints though and in any case I am searching for one more piece to the puzzle and my hope is that it might show up somewhere in this thread. Do I really need this though for my trading ? The answer is ofcourse no. However, I do need it to conquer this Quantum trading style if I wish to drive a 1K account into 10K .... thats why I need it, to finish this goal. Sometimes I wish I never had made this goal but now its become an obsession, in fact I'm also hoping that some other trader does it. One thing is forsure and that is plenty has been learnt along the way. Perhaps the learnings can later be shared here once the goal is completed. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I will look into your quantum thing but it is definitely possible under the right conditions. I did something similar in May across four 1K accounts shared here . I will remove the screenshot soon. Hint: two were long-only and the other two were short-only with two strategies (diverge and converge) across 28 pairs. Edit- I am a demo trader for life for the same reason you mentioned above. I run 5 instances in parallel with live :-)

The test is done with control points on 30 min. chart! This is not accurate result. Find some real historical tick data, and make the test again. Ideally you need real ticks + spread data. But if your trading model is based on higher timeframe above M15, then even M1 bars will produce a more realistic picture.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Agee. Tick data has more accurate results, but for this kind of test deviation is minor. For the sake of short video I did that. In fact I don’t use much mt4 anymore for automated testing as I find it less flexible and sometimes produces weird results. And as for test data I use fxcm and dukascopy high quality tick data. Trd

--- 帖子 #297 ---
dukascopy is quite good data actually. I use to test as well. It goes as far back as 2008 for some instruments. All my testing are done with real tick; I long ago stoped using control points. Better to be confident 100% before launching the EA to live trading.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Have you used real spread or fixed? I highly suggest you use real spread; as you will see big difference in results when I test GBPCAD with real ticks I get negative curve all the way down; as opposed to GBPUSD for example which is in the positive

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Lately I am too paranoid about any commercial or free software. I am writing my own now

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I have an agreement with my broker about fixed spread, so I test only with fixed. Ofc in order to be able to participate also during rollover when the spread can go as high as 50 pips. MT4 backtester cannot be trusted. I also noticed about it that depending on the strategy and type of test, results can deviate dramatically Suggest you to move also to other software or create your strategy by manual testing and do only forward tests The past doesn’t really matter much

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I stopped using MT4 since 2012; and using my own software (java based). If you are a programmer; it is not difficult to build a backtester that use real ticks. All you have to do is read the file ticks; and loop through them one by one till the end; and spit the results out. You can then improve it bit by bit as you go; till it becomes mature and matches your trading style. Based on my experience with backtesting on tick data; there is no way GBPCAD will work on this strategy.

Hi. Could you try this avarage atr list calculated by me. for example "eurusd" left side is eur right side is usd. left side eur m30 says 15pips / right side usd says 11 pips. i am in cautious side and i use 11 pips for target and 15 pips for stops if i open trade in m30 tf. (P.S.:and i hope to close in a few hours. 2-3 m30 bars) you could simulate only left or only right. what will be result.

I was on vacation so the week results are a little delayed... The results from 2018.08.26 to 2018.08.31 , nothing spectacular - original method with a little profit, my variant with a little loss. 9990 = my variant of SMR with 4H MA filter, BE stop, no fixed timed 25%/50% exits but "candlestick jumping stop loss" - see above for more details 9993 = original method from post 1 with only BE stop added. _ EA trades the broker min lots per symbol (0.01 for forex symbols, 0.10 for dax/dow) with some small kind of martingale (0.01 for first 3 trades, 0.02 for the next two trades and then 0.03 lots until MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed is reached). Both variants open the first trade only when min level of the ATR band of 3 is reached and also have a hard stop if ATR band 6 is reached! The broker used has fixed spreads per symbol and charges no commissions per trade.

The first week of september ( 2018.09.03 - 2018.09.07 ) ended +-0 for the original method and +50$ for my variant. 9990 = my variant of SMR with 4H MA filter, BE stop, no fixed timed 25%/50% exits but "candlestick jumping stop loss" - see above for more details 9993 = original method from post 1 with only BE stop added. _ EA trades the broker min lots per symbol (0.01 for forex symbols, 0.10 for dax/dow) with some small kind of martingale (0.01 for first 3 trades, 0.02 for the next two trades and then 0.03 lots until MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed is reached).

Thanks for providing the ongoing trading results Jagg. I'm yet to find any solid benefit from using the ATR bands although they do look pretty on the chart. Pretty or not its the advantage, if any that I'm after and so far its eluding me. More often than not its simply a case of being fed 'favorable data' by the market that provides the 'nice' outcome. I've modified the ATR Band formulas but nothing great has been found at this stage. Including the addition of ADR levels above and below DO price as well as Session Average Range levels above and below DO price to guage SL/or TP. I've also been testing hourly cycle lines in combination with ATR bands and Fibs to somehow contain the DD and this will continue. Although as I've always said, open trades 20-30 pips away from the DO line and then close the trade out at the DO line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Example, Stop @ Level 3 or Level 4 (at time of entry) Entry at Level 2 ATR band TP @ DO line. Note that Session Average Range Line is not shown but the actual high and low of completed session is shown (66.7 pips). Masterrmind.............

Hi Jagg, thank you very much for sharing your indicator. It is great to looking back the historical data and find it very useful to filtering those PA during Tokyo and early Europe market sessions. On the other hand, the indicator will repaint slightly, with a variance of 1 to 2 pips, over the day until the day close then no more repaint occur for that day. I guess the reason is the use of ATR which has included the TR of the current day (as day high/low will change over time). Is it possible to use ATR of previous day to keep the bands constant over the day?

The whole concept of mean reversion is straightforward and easy to understand. I don't trade full mean reversion strategies live yet, but I intend to add a pure mean reversion strategy to my current portfolio. I have attempted to create a fully automated EA with OP's original rules - with limit orders and market orders. But a intraday close all rule just wasn't giving me the ideal profit scenarios. My next step is to extend the intraday cycle using the original entry rules, but with different exit options.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Wouldn't you want to pass something tangible to your kids as a foundation for their future? That was my only intent to move from manual to automation plus travel the world care free and have someone else monitor my automation :-)

--- 帖子 #318 ---
That is very interesting that you would say that, because that is one of my major drivers. 1. I told my kids that I started late. A 20 year old with my information is almost promised to be a millionaire. 2. I distrust automation because platforms change with OS. In short, if you have a system that will bleed them dry slowly but surely you will be met with the same fate that happened to the MIT kids who cracked the blackjack table. You would never want to automate that. 3. Because of the WWW, I can still travel at will, I only really need to be online once a day at the FX reset. I just do not trust automation. Too many things can go wrong. That said, automation is one way to defeat biases.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Automation can be used in a smarter way than trading. For example if you are looking for an edge or to add a tool to your manual trading. Lets say if you trade Daily chat and you want to use a reversal candle pattern, but you dont know which is better : a pinbar or engulfing candle; inside or outside bar; etc. So you write a simple program that will give you the results over thousands of examples in minutes. You will spend weeks to figure out that manually. When you create, upgrade or just improve your strategy, you need to take out every feature and test it independently how it performs. For that automation is useful. TRD

Real proven edge + Automation + OPM( Other People's Money) = BIG SUCCESS! You still have doubts about this?? Inserted Video But still, probably the best solution for the average trader is the hybrid system. Automation + discretionary. I'm also big believer in pure old school manual trading because this style has its own advantages. However, the problem with manual trading is that it creates a lot of stress and emotions. And you get tired very quickly, especially with intraday trading and scalping. And when you get tired - you make mistakes! The robot never gets tired, and never makes mistakes.

Everybody wants a magic indicator then automation. Trading is about a deep connection to one characteristic of the market, that give you an edge. Most traders will spend years looking for indicators and automation, rather then do the hard work.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
True. But automation on itself is a VERY HARD WORK! You can wait for someone to give you the "magic" indicator or the magic EA - this is easy! Most people will settle on this option. Or you can start to do your own research and your own coding. Search for patterns, test them, build trading models.......it's a long process with many ups and downs. Excitements and disappointments......until you find something stable that works. Manual trading or automated - both require a lot of work and dedication. (If you want to do it professionally.)

as long as it technical matters, it is what it is. we even must be discipline to technical we are using. The common mistake trader makes is they dont pay any attention with the timing. even when with news come, they still do S/R measurement. Lol.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Exactly! People think automation is something you build once and mine the markets forever. Thats far away from the truth. Take prop firms that use such processes. They have huge teams of market analysts, physicists, statistician, risk managers. They invest millions in hardware, powerful internet connection, high quality feed. They use complicated mathematical models adapted to current market conditions and modify them on a daily basis. Machine learning, data mining... They collect terabytes of data on a daily basis from whole internate, scan forums, chat rooms, news sites, process,store and use the data in a complex way. They adjust the algos every day and improve them nonstop. They have teams to monitor them 247 and interact if needed. Who are we to try to copy them? haha TRD

Hi Jagg, You have done a good job of putting range scale on the chart. Is it possible to have a 4-hour range average scale on the chart. Attached is an indicator that draws vertical timelines every 4 or 8 hour. The past 1 4hr bar dotted line can show the ADR scale in gray color. Two gray scales will be there - one at the end of the chart for daily ADR Another at the end of 4 hours for last 4 hours. Thank you.

So is there an edge to incorporate 3/6/9 in a strategy? I tried a different I could not pinpoint any relevance either in price movement, use of it in indicator settings, in RR, in position sizing etc. It probably gives a edge in your mindset lnowning you are doing what's part of the universe....but then folks have tried fibo sequence, triange, rectaunglar, sqrt, forks, pivots, and everything inbetween. Perhaps, like adphadude's automation, we should do it all as sum of all parts to rebalance towards whatever works as part of intraday diversification. FYI - I AM currently looking into pure reversion to mean intraday strategy. Have you do any research or attempted aggressive stacking from 1 or 2 std deviations .By this, I mean how many positions (not martingle recovery) one must add to Breakeven when price oscillates in beteeen 1 and 2 levels. By this, I ask if there is a optimized position sizing formula in pip distance (not sizing) to strategically do the placements. By this, I ask if I have found something interesting that 90% of the time net position size goes into average be+1 for almost 90+% of the intraday candles. There are 3 sessions, 6 H4 candles and 24=6H1 candles, 60 M1 candles etc etc What I have yet to confirmcis whether there is any significance in tick time/volume weighed stuff. I will get this SOB one day :-(

--- 帖子 #332 ---
No. There is no edge in the numbers. But there is a hidden formula involving these numbers which can lead you to the edge . With this formula you can solve the "inevitable" problem which arises when you apply dynamic hedging trading model. (The problem of the constant unbalanced equation) I think I found a way to balance this equation perfectly at least 99% of the time. I'm sure of this! Now I'm writing the code in order to prove this theory first on demo and later on a live account. Maybe there is no real holy grail in trading, but this will be the closest thing to a holy grail.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Interesting.....good luck man. If you balance the dynamic hedge 99% of the time, how will you recover spreads and slippage costs? I tend to also think it is possible but only (at least in my case) if you trade really small size with large number of positions. Even with reversion to mean techniques you will always need a repeat of small (although brief) directional moves to recover and profit from that 1% to tilt the needle towards profitability. I think theorical models will look good but practicality of implementation would be prohibitive in nature (based on what I am seeing with mean reversion techniques which I recently took on) I feel I am still on the right track of saying we will always need more than just price to feed into your formula to generate positive expectancy. Perhaps volume? Not sure but it is indeed a fascinating problem that just makes you suck into the weeds deeper and deeper. Let me ask you this and hopefully we can look at this dilemma from a different perspective or theorem. How many attempts are required to make a 1pip net profit from a n pip range? This range could be a microscopic iew of say M5 or M15 candle range. I ran some models in demo this week by adding 100s of trades solely based on tick volume and observed 9 out of 10 times, my positions would always go in next profit even if it was only for few seconds. Is that a .Edge? Mathematical or theoritically for sure but in practical terms I highly doubt it. Brokers/MM will always have the upper hand with the 00 edge to prevent high speed sxalpers. If you are attempting something similar in nature then spot FX en vironment is not the right pace for it. Sorry for the rambling.

food for thougts http://technical-analysis-addins.com...-numbervib.php I found this post somewhere on the web. Its thought provoking if nothing else. Gann was into numerology. In numerology you want to find the number vibration by adding up the digits to bring it down to a single digit. For example if you have the number 2417 you add up the single digits [2+4+1+7 = 14=1+4 =5 So the number 2417 dances to the vibration of 5. Now the circle is 360 degrees if you break it up into 30 degrees increments you have 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 and 360… now if you break each number down to a single digit then you have a pattern or symetry working..3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9. Now you might say so what ?. Look at the pattern in percentages of price movement (Read W.D Gann..45 Years in Wall Street} 3.125 = 2 43.75 = 1 84.375= 9 6.25 = 4 46.875 = 3 87.5 = 2 9.375 = 6 50 = 5 90.625= 4 12.5 = 8 53.125 = 7 93.75 = 6 15.625= 1 56.25 = 9 96.875= 8 18.75 = 3 59.375 = 2 100 = 1 21.875= 5 62.5 = 4 25 = 7 65.625 = 6 28.125= 9 68. 75 = 8 31.25 = 2 71.875 = 1 34.375= 4 75 = 3 37.5 = 6 78.125 = 5 40.625= 8 81.25 = 7 See the percentages table when broken down to a single digit the percentage move to a perfect Yin and Yang pattern of order starting from Even digit to Odd digits and back to Even and then Back to Odd digits. Gann mentions in 45 years of Wall Street that the percentages was the one of the greatest discoveries he made. Now lets look at the number 144... when we bring it down to a single digit it comes to 9..so change of price or time can occur. So the following digits 18 36 54 72 90 108 126 144 bring to single digit = 9 . This applies in time and price. But you must go and back test these numbers on ranges in price,multiples of 144 For example look at the price of the stock when it is at 144 288 432 and so on. Also when the market of a particular stock is say for instance is at 2999 then look for the next resistance or support by adding 144 and wait for confirmation whether it will move into the next square of 144 If 144 is to much for that particular stock then do divisions of 144...18 36 54 72..... Study the number 144 more you will find it all ties into square of nine. You then needto go and back test these numbers on past history of a stock on a chart. The answers are all there one needs to put in the effort and you will see and discover more. kind regards to all Brett Hello David Thanks for the email Look at the number 144 .if you do a bit of study on numerology to find the real value of the vibration of the number you need to bring it down to a single digit. So if you add the digits 144{1+4+4 =9} So when a number reaches 9 it has to change back to 1 again. 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90 99 108 117 126 135 and 144 all add up to 9 when you bring it down to a single digit. When you look at a circle it has 360 degrees start from the cardinal points we have 0 90 180 270 360 now all these numbers add up to 9 when you bring it down to a single digit...now the trine points of the circle which is the 45 degrees to the cardinal points which of course is 90 ... so the trine points of the circle are 45 135 225 315 now each number here adds up to 9.... change occurs so in relation to the stock market go back test time and price .W.D Gann stated then go back test the history of the stock and prove it to yourself that the numbers keep on coming in.Also use time periods of 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 .. now if you bring these numbers to a single digit you will see a pattern of symetry 3 6 9..3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 ... in regards to % movement in price use the percentage number of 3.125 equals 2 6.25 equals 4 9.375 equals 6 12.5 equals 8 15.625 equals 1 18.75 equals 3 21.875 equals 5 25 equals 7 28.125 equals 9 31.25 equals 2 34.375 equals 4 37.5 equals 6 40.625 equals 8 43.75 equals 1 46.875 equals 3 50 equals 5 53.125 equals 7 56.25 equals 9 59.375 equals 2 62.5 equals 4 65.625 equals 6 68.75 equals 8 71.875 equals 1 75 equals 3 78.125 equals 5 81.25 equals 7 84.375 equals 9 87.5 equals 2 90.625 equals 4 93.75 equals 6 96.875 equals 8 100 equals 1 now you can see the symetry .But dont believe me go test it out for you self mathematics and Geomtry applied to the market reveals the Truth. Study study apply and prove it to yourself the biggest obstacle in one life is each individuals human conditioning and flawed way of thinking base on human emotion . To tap into the Universal Truth one needs to vibrate the same frequencies.....kill the ego embrace your realself {SPIRIT} and hang on for the time of your life. kind regards Brett Re-read the post .Buy the book The Day of Wisdom According to Number Vibration by Mrs .L Dow Balliett. regards Brett The book is available to read for free on-line at: http://site.ebrary.com/pub/kessinger

I started with numerology few days ago. Well more like "day ago" but on people it is fairly accurate. I use bigger numbers than 1 to 9. Even 85 says something about the person, house, phone number etc... And of course, got the idea to apply this on the market. But so far no ideas. I'm curious if we can use it also. You can count with name of I don't know... Princess Diana for 1997 and get some kind of result. Interestingly enough it showed number that says "death" in the year she died. So if we take EURUSD can we get future movement for year let's say 2019 or even month? It says yes, but I'm not yet sure how that works since it is kinda confusing for starters. I even tried few other persons that died and I took year the died and created a numerology number for them for the year. Did 3 so far and all of them got number that has something to do with death. I was kinda amazed to be honest, since the way I count it is the same. SF

V, have a read on this book; it's a classic and it is very useful for mean reversion trading. Pairs Trading: Quantitative Methods and Analysis by Ganapathy Vidyamurthy Trading Forex is actually "Pairs Trading" because you are trading the spread between two currencies (EUR vs USD, GBP vs USD, etc). the secret to mean reversion trading; is to know when to add positions; and when to exit positions solely based on the mean reversion model. Positions management, and exit management can add to the success; but the main edge; is in knowing when to enter and when to exit based on the model alone. hope this helps !

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks Dude. I will most certainly read but only after I tackle the mean reversion research on my own merit and effort. When I wear my research hat on, I go into complete information vacuum to elimination any bias to affect my 1000s of iterational approach I take to eliminate one theory at a time. I did the same for my trend following approach (dubbed universal time action strategy). It used the appraoch similar to Mandlebrot and I had no idea who he was until recently (I am one ignorant a'hole by design lol) You are spot on about entries when you say "the secret to mean reversion trading; is to know when to add positions; and when to exit positions solely based on the mean reversion model.".... I am of the belief that exits should have no significance on what type of entries one takes. I like to match my exits with my MM plan and objectives and not worry about exiting too early or too late (which can be a misery in itself if you keep on starring at entry setup and hoping the exit reversal setup would follow. As we know, what happens in the future is anybody's guess. I tend not to fool myself into thinking a exit "strategy" based on how I enter would give me any edge but that is just me.....specific to trend following. For mean reversion, you might be right but so far, I still like my exit to trigger based on my %target goals. With that said, I do tinker with overall equity %target goals based on my overall view of market sentiment (similarly, in your case with reversion to mean, you will need to tinker with %risk as entries are more important than exits). For divergence, exits are more important than entries.....classic dilemma but hybid model covering both RTM and DFMDFM off the best diversification out there. You can trade trend following using a mean reversion and you can trade a mean reversion using a trend following. We only need to watch for scale, duration and frequency which boild down to "Trading is an Art" philosophy camp and of course the overall understanding of market sentiment and volatility that one must have to make informed judgement across all strategies and entry/exit types.

THINK! PATTERNS! MARKET MODELS! TOTAL NUMBER OF VARIATIONS??? CYCLES! TIME DIVIDERS! RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TIME AND PRICE! PRICE OVER TIME! PRICE MOVING OVER TIME! (Not time over price!) TIME IS THE KEY! TIME DETERMINES PRICE! (Not the other way) NUMBER OF MARKET MODELS BASED ON FIXED TIME CYCLES? HOW MANY? 3 ! 1. HORIZONTAL RANGE (Many variations) 2. RANGE WITH DIRECTIONAL DRIFT (Many variations) 3. SMOOTH DIRECTIONAL TREND (Many variations) WHAT ARE THE PERCENTAGES FOR EACH MODEL TYPE? 1 - DOMINATES! 2 - APPEARS FROM TIME TO TIME. 3 - VERY RARE! WHAT ARE THE MAIN PARAMETERS WHICH DESCRIBE EACH MODEL TYPE? (These parameters never change!) PAY ATTENTION! The number 3 unlocks the next secret which is based on the number 6 !

Look at the pictures above! Do you realize, that there is nothing else beyond these 3 models? Of course, the market is a fractal and there are models from different time frames. There are smaller models inside the bigger models...... But this is all there is! 3 main models!!! These are the building blocks. Let that sink in.

What you have shared here is the foundation of my automation. Across the 3 models, there is a signature that makes room for "Universal Entry setup" that could work under all market conditions covering all trading styles (scalping, day,swing,position, bounce, breakout, follow, reverse, pullback etc etc ).... requiring just a little bit of proactive creativity to manually manipulate the "SCALE". Hint: Markets are Universal and Neutral - PipEasy Universal Time Action Strategy - VeeFX Price is a variable 100% of the time Price can be manipulated 100% of the time via spreads and slippage Time can/is also manipulated.... eliminate GMT, DST and offset crap from your strategy and you finally have "Time as a Constant" to anchor in space to base your Universal entries from. Eliminate as many variabilities from the strategy and rely only on constants that can be managed via parameter setting Eliminate history. You don't need it! Eliminate backtesting. It cannot be done - Doable but certainly not easy . Works most of the time but requires time consuming and tiring active portfolio management (even with automation). IT's not something I had hoped for when I embarked on my journey towards automation - Works awesome when things are aligned and going your way with no cap to upward limitation. let the equity explosion happen and take it as far as you can - Works not to well at some times that I am unable to figure out the reasons.... perhaps at times of algo manipulation by big boys - Works only with 28 pairs or all individual AUD, NZD, EUR, JPY, GBP etc pair selections - fails with just one pair or random selection - works when pairs are matched with active sessions - works with active exposure management.... reduce positions during session lunch time, in-between sessions etc, add when volatility picks up - requires many open positions for week to end in net positive.... my optimized model reveals the approx number of trades required to end the week with net positive pips (if market dislocations that I am unable to capture in real time does not happen) - it performs better and more superior performance with account growth and with larger account size (as I requires trade small and often). This model is ideal to be run as a hedge fund lol - round the clock rinse repeat.... make me work round the clock as well :-( Edit: I just made some edits

A bit more on my philosophy about "Time is everything". As CP rightfully said here , Time has no effect on price movements in a pure abstract form i.e Time is not the causation of price movement but Time is definitely a determining factor of volatility which will ultimately move price. This is especially true in spot fx when session open/close, scheduled economic news releases, etc can be trapped towards profit-taking episodes. Time in regards to entries is not important (and completely ignored), Time becomes the "crucialpoint" (he he) for my volatility induced exits. I take all my universal entries as long as I have free margin (with the necessary diversification controls in place.... as and when signals are generated. The juice gets squeezed when the exits are triggered based on my manipulation of scale and pair selection matching process against time (as a constant) within each session. Time is also a crucial point when it comes to your trading objectives and goal setting (i.e. investment horizon) imo. Monthly goal setting requires far more trading capital to open more positions. Weekly requires less, daily even less.... hence "Time is Everything"..... "Timing is everything" applies to just about anything in life.... even to a cheetah catching his prey and to all aspects of similarities we find in mother nature. Peace

let me spill some beans about the markets; trading the markets is like having sex with a woman. there are times when sex will be great; and times when it will be horrible. eventhough the man (you in this case) can be ready for sex anytime; the woman (the market) is not. You need to know when she is ready and when she wants it

AO, you have shared plenty of extremely valuable information and ideas around the concept of mean reversion. Many of us sincerely appreciate your contributions and sharing of information. We look forward to more details regarding your thinking around this concept to grow our knowledge within this area. For me, the concept of "mean" is a reference point. This reference point could come in many forms. It could be measured by simple moving averages, ATR, or even using various forms of custom indicators. These 3 factors have kept me grounded when it comes to creating a mean reverting portfolio: 1) Diversification 2) Position sizing 3) Trade management Entry and exit conditions would form part of the equation of a mean reverting strategy, and could range stretch from intraday, weekly to monthly in terms of time horizon. This is not to discount the fact that intraday closures are not optimal - I just couldn't replicate better results with a day-end close. I couldn't stress more about the importance of diversification for pure mean reverting portfolios because of the fact that you need to spread your risk out across as many currency pairs as possible, and it's not always a bed of roses if you trade just one single currency pair. View the attachments for some examples for GU and AU. I may spend more time elaborating and I am keen to hear more from AO about his current methodology. Time to hit the bed, it's been a long day..

The very nature of space-time is changed because it actually contains these changes of scale in an intrinsic and irreducible way to the ordinary space-time which is, in itself, in the physico-mathematical vision, a set of points. (...) In reality, this vision in which we represent the world in the form of points pretends to make measurements with infinitely great precision - at each small spatial interval corresponds a small time interval. However, it is quantum mechanics that tells us that it would take an infinite energy to be able to make such a measurement. One could say that this is only a limit for the man who observes and measures, but that is false. This limit, in particular the Heisenberg inequality, is related to the fundamental mechanism of matter and not only to a measurement made by man (or the machine produced by him). This means that a very small space requirement requires a very long time and a very short time requires a very high energy. The point, defined with infinite precision, requires infinite energy! Nature can not realize its own interactions, independent of the observer, by constantly spending such infinite energy. It operates necessarily with imprecision. It is the most energy efficient mechanism. Convergence occurs only after emergence of a global order resulting from the disorder of variable, imprecise and unpredictable interactions. (...) One point, it does not exist! Moreover, it can be seen right away. If we say that there is a point on a table, what is meant by a point? Something that has no dimension. Just look with a magnifying glass to discover a structure. We continue to magnify the magnifying glass and then we go to the microscope: when can we finally see the point? Never. So, physically, the point does not exist. (...) The interesting idea is that each time you get fat, you see something new.

As If is a good tool we do not know really the exact nature of Price and Time Relationship , but we can approximate this relation and use analogy the Gap Down between the close of Day (N-1) and the Open of Day N can be seen as a "Quantum Leap" . This Gap disturb the previous balance of Price Action . Then Price Action needs some Time to recover its Balance and returned to its mean. Price and Time can be shown on a Chart to help us , but Price and Time are not of the same nature. Time never goes backwards. Price can.

Space and Time have become inseparable. Two simultaneous events in a reference system are no longer in another reference system. The principle of relativity implies the absence of a privileged observer. The description of the phenomena should not depend on the different observers. Each of them must find the same physical law. Everyone can find the referential coordinates of other observers. Space is not three-dimensional and there is no absolute time, each individual has his own measure of time depending on the place and the way he moves. Every moving object has its own clock. If observers observe a phenomenon while moving at different speeds, they will describe the event sequences differently in time and what for one happens in his future, appears for the other in his past. This, of course, seems unthinkable for our ordinary consciousness, which is experiencing daily an arrow of time, the inexorable flow of a past to the present and the future. In addition, the time passes more slowly if the speed approaches that of the light (it is the dilation of time). The speed increases the service life (in accelerators, a particle with a very short lifetime sees its life increase at very high speeds close to that of the light). Mobile clocks delay compared to fixed clocks. It is an illustration of this real existence of space-time. Before Einstein, space and time had been thought of as possessing fixed characteristics, given once and for all: the geometry of space is, has been and will always be that described by Euclid and time advances independently of all the rest . Things could move in space and evolve over time, but space and time themselves never changed. (...) Einstein's general theory of relativity differs completely. There is no fixed background. The geometry of space and time varies and evolves constantly, as does the rest of nature. (...) There is no longer a field that moves on a fixed geometric background. On the contrary, we have a collection of fields, all of which interact with each other, which are dynamic, all of which influence others, and the geometry of space-time is one of them.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
The astrophysicist Laurent Nottale exposes, in "The complexity, vertigo and promise": "The very nature of space-time is changed because it actually contains these changes of scale in an intrinsic and irreducible way to space ordinary time which is, in the physico-mathematical vision, a set of points. " One of the fundamental results is that space has a discrete structure (as opposed to the space-time continuum of general relativity): areas and volumes of space are quantized. The notion of space is in a way replaced by the notion of primitive grains, sorts of "atoms" of space or, more exactly, quanta of the gravitational field, connected to each other by links characterized by a spin (spin of link) hence the name of spin network. This field (space-time) should thus present a granular structure in the form of a cloud of space-time grains, the dynamics of which must be probabilistic. From today, you will consume me as totally crazy to apply all this to trading. But read well and you will find concordances.

So much crap in the main stream, deceptions and half truths....................... Time is MAN Made............ The fiscal world only knows the present............ we humans can only reflect the past and contemplate the future- but there is no future only the present. Bending time and space has no basis in real world -- verbal masturbation at its best. Bending space --- define space, please...........Its the either stupid. Einsteins equations were crap...... Morley experiment was plagiarized..... Its possible that Einsteins wife wrote the formulas.... ..... Einstein even admitted that there had to be a either..... I can go on --- but it does not matter... we live in the age of deception and most science, health, politics- that is main stream is wrong... Einstein had some missteps. Particularly he introduced a Cosmological Constant to achieve a static (non-expanding/contracting) universe. Einstein revoked the notion when Edwin Hubble proved conclusively that the universe was expanding. Einstein called his Cosmological Constant the biggest blunder of his life. Tesla references to relativity: In 1934, on the occasion of his 79th birthday, Tesla denounced relativity theory as "a beggar wrapped in purple whom ignorant people take for a king" and "a mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of science of the past and even to common sense... the theory wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors.... its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists. Not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved." (NYT, 7/11/1935, hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view. Today’s scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality. – Radio Power Will Revolutionize the World in Modern Mechanics and Inventions (July 1934) “Only the existence of a field of force can account for the motions of the bodies as observed, and its assumption dispenses with space curvature. All literature on this subject is futile and destined to oblivion. So are all attempts to explain the workings of the universe without recognizing the existence of the ether and the indispensable function it plays in the phenomena. My second discovery was of a physical truth of the greatest importance. As I have searched the entire scientific records in more than a half dozen languages for a long time without finding the least anticipation, I consider myself the original discoverer of this truth, which can be expressed by the statement: There is no energy in matter other than that received from the environment.” – Nikola Tesla There is so much more --- but this makes the point...... want to know more that is in the present, ck this org out.............

Hi Apha first i congratulaite you for your results the curve look's awesome now what i see on the photo is 1 weekly candle wich shows you the weekly trend and bigger M daily candles. Now from your experience (because price allways have tendency to go in 1 direction and revers) you chose reversals in direction of major weekly Trend!? Thanc you.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
No. It's a different logic and much more complicated. The MTF trends are irrelevant for this system. As I said in my earlier posts, from statistical point the time cycles are 100% independent events. My algos trade all signals, in all 28 pairs, in all directions! As you can see in the screenshot there are 4 automated Algorithms. (A1, A2, A3, A4). Each algo is a separate system and a different signal. These algos operate in such a way that they have almost no overlap. They also take into account the correlations between the currency indexes (see my previous posts). This is how I detect dangerous situations very early and automatically trigger the equity stop. (before the shit hits the fan) I also put size limits on each position based on the volatility and other things. Bad things happen only when you get too big too fast against the strongest trends! So far, in this thread I only gave info and partial description for the first system (A1) and a few clues for the other algos. A few people got it, they understood my ideas and are working on their own versions. The rest still scratch their heads. It is what it is. Maybe I already gave too much info here.....

--- 帖子 #379 ---
AO; good work mate. I like the currency index filter. if you can elaborate further it will be great. I tried in the past similar filter but with no statistical significance. i.e. trade only if currency is moving alone; not because of USD index is moving across the board.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
The indexes are just one factor. If the whole index is outside 2 standard deviations - take actions to reduce risk (close positions if you have to). But there are many other factors that you have to track if you want to detect the danger early! News. Obviously. Turn off the system before major news. This way you avoid almost half of the fat tails. Sometimes manual intervention is necessary. Pay attention to the spreads ! Track the averages! Sudden spread spikes across the board for no reason = danger signal! Watch out for smooth trends. If the trend is too smooth and too fast with very few corrective moves this is danger signal! Pay very close attention to the characteristics of Model 3! (the smooth trend). Unusually high tick volume = danger signal. There are many more. But just to name a few. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Thx AO, nice tips!

--- 帖子 #382 ---
AO, that's plenty of filters to implement; and all make sense.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi AO, what do you think is the best quantitative way to measure the smoothness/corrective moves of a trend? In hindsight we can detect that by just observing the chart; but programmatically it's harder.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi alpha, if I may share my thoughts on on this.. AO is mentioning model3 when he talks about smooth trends, if i look at model3 i see price is not returning to mid range. This fact alone is not enough, maybe add a time parameter? for example: when price did not touch mid range for an x amount of time, you are in danger of being in a smooth trend? Or: if price did make new highs/lows x amount of times in an hour you are in danger of being in a smooth trend? To know for sure when you are in a smooth trend is only to be seen in hindsight, so these thoughts are surely not 100% correct but better be safe then sorry.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
will check it out with statistical analysis. I previously used a concept called "Bar Factor" to determine that market within the current day is trending or not. for up trend: Bar factor = (Close - Open) / (High - Low). for down trend: Bar factor = (Open - Close) / (High - Low). if Bar Factor is greater than 0.80 (meaning 80% full body or more); then we are likely in an up trend. Tried this filter but did not improve the results in the backtest. This bar factor filter *may* be useful in predicting if today will be a ranging day or not: If previous day's bar factor is &gt; 0.80; then today is likely to be a ranging day. However this fitler did not improve the backtest results.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
As a matter a fact, yes there is something unusual. I find it a bit hard to understand how the indexes are calculated, the numbers (bid or ask) don't add up. Take for example EUR index, you can easely see sum of bids (or asks) is above 140 while the index is @ 134 in the screenshot. I also tried some variations adding the ! colomn to the equation but no succes. EDIT: Nevermind this question, a kind member of the forum explained to me how it's calculated, thanks a lot luisinho! Very straightforward multiply all members of the index by factor 100 except jpy pairs and then calc average. Bit embarresed why i didn't think of this myself lol.

Measure the average and the maximum length of the trend corrections for the given period. In the context of this strategy it's best to measure this length as a percentage of the range. I give you example: For Model 1 the average correction is above 50%. And you have at least 2 or more corrections above 100%. For Model 2 the average correction is below 50%. But you have at least 1 or more corrections above 50%. For Model 3 the average correction is below 25%. And the longest is below 50%. In some extreme cases the longest correction for the whole cycle is below 30% and even below 25%. This is extremely smooth trend! But this type of cycles are very rare. Play with the numbers, see what happens......

Thanks for the link. It seems that they try to use just one idea "horology" but thats not imho a good way and far to be the most interesting idea developpe. The difficulty is indeed to "translate" and use these apparently complex notions in trading.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Tracking and logging your account drawdown (and other metrics) in real time is very important when you trade with automated systems. Without accurate data you can't go very far and the probability for catastrophic mistakes is too high to ignore! You need accurate statistics in order to optimize the systems for maximum performance in relation to the risk. Now, you can use some free third party online apps (trade explorer), but this option is very unreliable and not accurate at all! I came to this conclusion recently after some detailed "manual" analysis on my accounts. So last week I wrote a few different loggers in order to track and to record some account/market metrics in real time. The difference is night and day! The conclusion? If you trade with automated systems - do not try to use online trade explorers for system optimization! Make your own tools! Make you your own statistics! Here you can test one of my new tools: Drawdown logger. Attached File(s) Drawdown Logger.ex4 8 KB | 586 downloads This indicator will log your account drawdown in real time with perfect accuracy! The indicator creates separate folder for each account and separate file for each trading day. You can change the log interval. The default interval is 60 seconds. NOTE! If you change time frames or the settings while the indicator is working - this will restart the statistics for the maximum drawdown. Simply attach the indicator to some empty chart adjust the log interval and leave it there. As long as the platform is connected you will have perfect logs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The system is working great for now! Now it's OFF for some upgrades and optimization. I'm still testing on demo and on micro live accounts with different settings and risk levels.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Absolutely no problems during the S&amp;P500 crash! Even with the highest risk settings. Actually Monday was a lot more problematic. One of the demo accounts had 40% drawdown but this is because I set very aggressive settings and high leverage. Here is my method for risk optimization: 1. First I have to find the maximum risk limit of the system. (By using multiple demo accounts simultaneously) 2. I will set the risk level on my live account 60% below the maximum limit.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
This system has potential. As I mentioned earlier in some posts; that I trade a variation of your strategy for few years already. Here is my *live* trading performance for the whole year of 2018 till present day (in pips) on EURUSD. There are 950 trades, longest drawdown was 36 days, and max drawdown was 180 pips; and return is 780 pips.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Today i tried the logger, but it looks like there's something wrong with the last column: max drawdown, it doesn't seem to calculate the max DD properly. It works great when DD is increasing but when DD decreases at some point it will log a lower max DD.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
You have to place the indicator on a separate empty chart! Do not use this chart for other things. Max DD value will reset if you change the time frame or the settings. I use separate MT4 terminal on VPS where I place all loggers. This way I log everything nonstop 24/5. (Drawdown statistics, all ticks and spreads for all pairs and the slippage on all trades)

I haven't read the entire thread. But you might want to consider trading ONLY in the direction of H4 and H1 relative currency strength for the chosen pair(s).

It sure is the million dollar question!

You can't imho. Another option is spread the risk trading multiple instruments and at end off each day cut the loss where the other profits will make up for a part of it. I'm not sure yet, there may vary well be much better solutions...

More or less good profits were generated only for the indices CFD (Dax and Dow) - forex doesn't look that good. 9990 = my variant of SMR with 4H MA filter, BE stop, no fixed timed 25%/50% exits but "candlestick jumping stop loss" - see above for more details 9993 = original method from post 1 with only BE stop added. _ EA trades the broker min lots per symbol (0.01 for forex symbols, 0.10 for dax/dow) with some small kind of martingale (0.01 for first 3 trades, 0.02 for the next two trades and then 0.03 lots until MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed is reached). Both variants open the first trade only when min level of the ATR band of 3 is reached and also have a hard stop if ATR band 6 is reached! The broker used has fixed spreads per symbol and charges no commissions per trade.

Interesting that indexes show better results.... Keep in mind that the original rules of the system from the first posts are only a starting point! A seed for something great! In order to make this system really profitable you have to do many mods and optimizations. And by the way, I already gave ALL necessary information in this thread. Unfortunately most people are too lazy and do not want to use their heads. Everyone wants to get something for nothing. You will see most people wasting their time in the "Interactive" section, commenting the next "big" move, or reading the fake news. While threads like this where real development happens.....these threads are neglected. I tell you, there are MANY profitable strategies and good ideas here in Forex factory and in other forums. Especially In old threads from 10 years ago..... But I guess people don't want to be real winners. They like to lose. If you look at my "crazy" posts back in the thread - this is where my hidden message is! This is the gold for the next generations. Someone who is smart enough, somewhere, someday will find this gold and will become rich!

Are you sure AO ? That 'Load' run-up is way too heavy IMHO to trade live. Trade carefully ! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Yes, I'm pretty sure. What you see on the chart is a stress test with maximum leverage 500:1 ! And the system still survives. This means that with lower leverage this system is very safe.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hello, the stress test is on multiple pairs or just one pair?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Glad to see you getting it done. Wondering if we will get to see a live TE as mentioned in the screenshot below? I am also curious to see if you have incorporated the 3/6/9 "formula" mentioned here

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Interesting. Would you be able to run this only on one Index NQ (nasdaq) from July till date with MaxTradesPerSymbolAllowed = 3 and (only if possible) during NYSE active session from 9:30am = 4pm ET? If it is configurable, please include a fixed spread of 1 tick (or what equivalent 'pip' is valid for CFD) and $5 per contract (1 tick is $5 in futures contract) on a $25K account size. and same configuration with SnP if you can. It would be interesting to compare stats between the two SMR. I think NQ will blow the account and SnP will work the best.

Just sharing my experience... I spent months developing and optimizing a multi-strategy, multi-pair, multi-tf system on 500:1 leverage using offshore broker which was extremely profitable (by design) only during fat tails (diversified divergence from mean instead of reversion to mean). When I moved to 50 leverage, it balked because it limits the scope of diversification and the way I calculate my position sizing based on FreeMargin. What you said is true only if you have a very large capital base to compensate for the leverage and have no impact on diversification across the intended multiple pairs of choosing. Just sharing my own experience which turned out to be quite disappointing in the end. I would also say (not sure if this is applicable in your design).... I would question the merit of long term success of any strategy that is dependent or sensitive to Account Balance or Account Leverage or Position Sizing in general. To me, these are the tell tale signs of a heavily optimized strategy to curve-fit the market movements from past. I really hope you have found the gold brother. I never doubted your intelligence :-)

Certainly the rest of the trade analytics would be useful here instead of just showing a single chart. But its your show. Masterrmind.............

Secrete of No 6 is market conditions? 1 High volatility 2 Low volatility 3 Trending up 4 Trending down 5 Ranging 6 Transition condition market made up on these conditions.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yeah, and all you actually need is: 1 - Buy, 0 - Sell (up/down, high/low). That be it... Everything else is meaningless.. Sell high, buy low, zoom f*g out for better results, cause on 5min you really don't know where you are... Kinda Photoshop trading, if it's high on screen sell, if its low, buy, do this on 30+ pairs and you got profit... Simplify as possible, not otherwise...

Missed the all time results from magic number 9993 - so here is the last peace of my gathered results (for better comparison again the all time results from magic number 9990)

Dear Alpha, Is it possible to have the drawdown for each pair opened? Thanks in advanced

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yes, it's possible, but not with this indicator. This indicator records the difference between the balance and equity taking into account all open positions. When you don't have open positions it does not record anything.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Dear Alpha, thanks for the quick reply, looking forward for the 'each pair drawdown' Indicator . Thanks anyway for the info.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
AO, with your DD logger i can see one version of this system i made, sometimes reaches 50% DD intraday... But always comes out ahead eventually. How much intraday DD do you experience in your system if I may ask? And how much would you consider too much?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
There is no such thing as too much drawdown on account basis. All depends on how you manage your capital and how much you are willing to lose. All about risk:reward. If You don't understand what I mean, you can check one of my old posts on this topic. This is how I manage my capital. You can apply this system no matter how large or small your capital is.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
great post, thanks!

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Do you want to know WHY this system works?? Here is the answer in the form of nicely visualized statistical data. This is the price distribution (close prices on M5) from the last 200 days on EURUSD. Do you notice the cluster in the first half of the day?? BOOM! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Do you do your statistical analysis in MT4? Have you changed scale in/out or do you still add to losses on this EA? Nice EA thanks for all your posts, not just this one.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Can you see the pattern? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #435 ---
If the market moves from point A to point B in a straight line over time T , then what is the actual length of the movement from A to B ? If the market moves up from point A to point B and down from B to point C, then what is the actual length of the movement from A to C ? If the market moves down from point A to point B and up from B to C and down from C to D , then what is the actual length of the movement from A to D ? If the market moves........ Yes, that's right. The more it moves, the longer the length becomes. Or in other words, the frequency of directional change + the amplitude determines the total length. Now, here comes the real question! Where the total length of price movement is longer? During range, or during trend? And why this even matters? What happens when you know precisely the total length of price movement for all time frames and all markets all the time?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
well I have more questions. How are A,B,C,D defined? Local max /mins?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
The best way is to use fractals from different time frames! I simply apply the standard formula with 5 bars. You can apply this formula even down to the tick level. BTW Just look at the EURUSD for example. How much movement there is! The total length is enormous! Thousands and thousands of pips every week! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Reminds me somehow on th π and river movement analogy . However, if you use the tick chart to get the best estimate of the market fluctuations, you'll find that π is very different from 3.141 ... So, if we would precisly know the total length of price movements for a particular time and time frame, we could somehow predict how price has to act. Example: We know that price has to move X ticks within 1 hour. Now we waited 55 minutes but price just went X - 142 ticks. Thus, price has to move more (either in an oscillating = ranging or in a straight line manner) to reach X within the remaining 5 minutes ...?!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Yep that's fine but again, you need direction in order to profit from the move. At the start of the day I know a pair is going to move &gt;60 pips, but I need direction to get the pips..

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes - I was never able to do something useful with it, especially since its variation is too high in short-term applications ...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
During range, it matters because mean reversion profit is ideally made during range. What happens? I'm not sure... Total length will increase if you go into smaller timeframes, but if you calculate this for all markets and all timeframes what happens? Your CPU will be busy, but that's not the correct answer i guess.. I'm in the blind here, I don't know what happens.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Are you refering to the scaling laws from R. Olsen ?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I was puzzled by the question so I took my ticks database for EUR/USD. I measured the path length (sum of absolute tick returns) over all periods of 24 hours starting at every hour. It isn't really a range vs trend classification but the bigger the return the more I expect the price has trended during the period... I cannot see anything. Yet I'm amazed that the average length of the price path is 18980 pips per day for an average return of only 58 pips. This is for EUR/USD since 2003 Attached Image (click to enlarge) (I did this quickly after work so there may be an error somewhere)

--- 帖子 #444 ---
how many of 18980 pips were up ticks (in distance) versus down ticks on a one hour engulf candle (if any)? how about a day or week or month or a combination of H4+H1 or H1+M30+M5 or M30+M15+M1 or any such combinations? "Mandlebrot"

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Nothing happens! But it will take you awhile (or forever) to understand what I mean by nothing . And why this is important. I strongly suspect very few people know about this. For example, I started trading a long time ago and I found the most important things only in the last few months. And that's not even funny. Now I know that I wasted many years walking in the wrong direction. Most people don't even know they are walking in the wrong direction. You will have to go into the deep, back in history before the year 1970 to understand where and how the current financial system came to be. The architects of the international currency markets created very fine machine! Almost perfect. Their secret "multidimensional triangular equation" was supposed to keep the world under control. And it does. To some extend. However, they made one mistake! There is a flaw in their machine. Anomaly. If you find this anomaly...... You see, it is very simple. The market is like a game. (Do you like to play games? Mind games? Logical games? Math games?) You can play with the market by the rules (Like 99.9% of the people) and in this case you will lose every time ! Just like you will lose every time if you play in the casino. OR you can initiate a search for the back door . OR you can simply look for the weakness (the anomaly) in the system! All you need to know is that Everything adds up to 1 . Remember that! The market does not move as much as it appears! The sum of all prices is pretty much stationary and oscillates around some fixed values. All these currencies...USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, AUD, CAD, NZD, CHF........they are simply cogs in the machine! You can't beat the individual cogs in the long run. Or it's extremely hard and mostly depends on luck. But, if you are smart, you will target the whole machine! And in this case you have a real chance to beat the game. And the market makers (the LP's) will hate you for this! Just like the owners of the casino will hate you when you hit them with 100K 5 times in a row. You beat their little game every time. And in the case of the market you beat their large game every time. I know that many people will not understand a single word of what I'm saying here. But that's OK.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Good Job bro... something I have been screaming all long since I wore my "facts and data" hat. Many will NEVER understand the entire inner workings of that fantastic mathematical balance. It is REQUIRED to keep the faith in our global financial system. You are getting there.... on the right path but not possible in retail market structure with the tools we have available to us.... and mind you, in regulated markets, whatever you discover (I know where you are going with this) is not allowed under the context of "keeping markets fair and balanced" or "preventing market (making) disruptive practices". I know first hand on my first day trading futures. You can NEVER win going against market making... you have to piggy back them and use their support and leverage. "Do what Markets(makers) HAS to do to survive(make price)".... i have been telling this all along and there is a reason why I was yelling and screaming "Show me the evidence of your success" on every thread from June thru August. Long term profitability is VERY HARD in the currency market trading price based strategies. Only two ways it is possible for intradays... 1) microscalpings 2) portfolio diversifications via multi-strategies and I will stand by my research till the end of time. It's a game designed to trick you into thinking "you are just around the corner to make it big". That day will never come for the 99.99% who are still trying this for over a decade.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Now that you found part of the "secret", what is your next step? Come on, PipMeUp you are one of the smartest people in this forum. If you can't find the solution to the problem here, then what is left for the rest of the forum? Here is what I'm thinking. If there is so much "excess" movement in comparison to the actual open to close change, isn't this the most obvious market inefficiency? Add the fact that the 28 pairs balance out most of the time, during the first half of the day. And we have all the stars aligned right in front of us. Directions, trends, news...all is irrelevant. All we have to do is to make the correct algorithm (with the correct math) to capture small percentage of this total excess length. All we need is something like 0.1% of the total length of all pairs. This will result over 500 pips per day net profit. Can you see the light?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I am generally weak in math (I can barely understand your SQRT(Time) function) so went the route of applying brute force. If I may add a hint. I came to the conclusion that there are only two possibilities (across 28 pairs) given unlimited capital (just for modeling purposes). 1) you either take frequent small wins during your accounting period (mine of always 4 days of week) and close the remaining in loss 2) take frequent small losses and end the week in net profit... pick your poison. The magic (balance or equity explosion) happens when you know which market conditions is ripe for which type of exits to incorporate for which pairs to match against which sessions and using volatility (news/session open or close) towards lift your spirits :-

--- 帖子 #449 ---
For now, all I know is that my 28 pair HFT system works surprisingly well most of the time . (It's a real beast and amazing to watch in real time) Unfortunately not all the time. Occasionally the balance breaks and I have to give back almost all of the profits in order to prevent larger losses. I still make a little net profit, but this is not even close to the real potential of the system. Now here is the real deal, If I find effective solution (the correct math) for this balance problem, then the market makers (And the retail brokers) are going to be in serious trouble. It's possible for this to escalate very quickly even starting with small capital! The only way for them to survive my algo it to hedge every single trade. Otherwise am going to drain them to the last penny. They will owe me money! But we all know they can't hedge my trades. And so, I'm going to kill them with 1 million cuts! They will have to ban me from trading if they want to survive. But for now they are safe. For now.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Your experience is VERY similar to my algo. I posted by results in the diversifief trend trading thread for april/may. It might still be there I think. If you are doing this in mt4, they won't ban you. They will simply issue to "Not Connected' comment and fake disconnect your EA. I really hope and pray you succeed as you are only validating my hard core research...I love it !!! EDIT: Not to discourage you... that is certainly not my intention but the biggest enemy you will encounter in creating such a balanced equation (in real live environment) is the spread widening. It destroys any sort of mathematical equation which simply cannot be modeled in demo unfortunately. I could not try this but please see if entry and exiting on midpoint of bid/ask helps with the balance. May be always use midpoint in the calculations and/or limit your algo execution to only just few hours during one active and liquid market and use session start as your starting time instead of daily open. And, finally, do not forget to check for spreads during exits. Not many know or track spread widening at exits. lol If you really see all the "trading conditions" that span across brokers, you will see a hidden message in those terms. example: stop limit distance. That's the biggest edge they have to prevent retailers from trapping price to the micropip level by disallowing them NOT to enter too close to the current price! Second spread widening but with a twist either by keeping bid static and spread the ask or keep ask and spread the bid... depending on whether you are entering or exiting the position. Third, cutting the margin in half for hedged trades. Yes, that is a huge apparatus in their arsenal. Forth / StopOut levels, this is ALSO huge, the more they allow you to drain the account, it becomes almost impossible to recover making you lose MORE than your USED MARGIN. Biggest scam ever! We must only lose the required margin per trade and nothing more! Fifth, Charging swap by the second. Shame on you Oanda ! you are draining accounts in microcents at absolutely no cost of credit for intra-day positions. Sixth, altering margin rules based on increased volatility... quite damaging for position traders and finally, Seventh/ Messing with improper FIFO implementation. Edit2: Forgot to add two more.... Eighth / NOT checking available/free margin for pending orders. Recipe for quick margin call if you are not careful. 9) not allowing change of position size of pending orders.... another huge edge they want to prevent! All of the above only applies to MT4 platform brokers.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
This is what I think: The broker will start to initiate "disconnections" as soon as my account becomes large enough to cause problems. The other thing is that most brokers have some limit regarding the number of open trades. Usually from 200 to 500 max per account. (These limits cripple my algo) If I put 100K in one account and my algo starts hitting them with a few hundred trades per hour they will notice this quickly. Especially considering the fact that sometimes I make up to 20% per day. So here is the actual plan for implementation: I select the 20-30 brokers with the best trading conditions and spreads. Deposit small amount into each broker. Ideally below 5K. (This is the average retail deposit). All terminals are running on one workstation and I use one of the terminals for a signal. This is where I Install my system with the interface. From the main terminal I send signals to all other terminals via trade copier. Hopefully this way the operation will survive a lot longer and I will be able to withdraw profits before they even know what is happening. It's not ideal long term solution, but I think this will work for some time. Probably long enough to pull a few mil. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #452 ---
They performed disconnects on my $1000 400:1 leverage when it reached a rapid 1200%. My experience with brokers is limited to being in the USA so this model could work if you are based elsewhere. I like the trade copier approach but know that internal memory leaks will start to creep when you reach to 200+ position count and could not run more than 4-6 terminals in parallel on the latest I7 7th gen CPU. Keep at it man. I really hope you succeed. Dont forget to put a live TE for us wannabe millionaires to gaze on :-)

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Will see how it goes. I'm currently starting to experiment with this setup with demo accounts just to see if I can run the whole operation from 1 PC. So far 20 terminals no problem. CPU below 30% and memory a few GB max. The key is to make the terminals light! No charts, no indicators, minimum bars in history. Only 1 chart per terminal with lightweight EA. And you keep the platform minimized! On the main terminal I have my interface where the signals are coming from and this alone consumes around 5% CPU. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Forgot to ask... does your algo try to optimize trade frequency? I think trade frequency will matter hugely in what you are trying to achieve and not just std deviations of price. It would be interested to know if you do (and the framework around it). Time Frequency is essential for scalping volume-centric trades in order to optimize use of available margin. Also, when your algo does not work (as you said), look into the pairs with disproportion margin requirement and $/pip. I feel this infinite design (the global currency market game as you rightfully put it) has some protections built in between $/pip vs used margin vs pip range over speed to thaw down the equity explosion process (either upward or downward)... extremely complex shit that drove me insane for over 2+ yrs. Yep. tried all that. CPU will churn up with volatility so something to keep in mind. IS your EA one multipair, multiTF EA running on each tick? mine required that I run on every maintenance on every tick and entries/exits only on open close of M1 candle (M1 being the universal time element). The entire entry signal generation process would take over 20+ seconds across 28 pairs.... perhaps yours is more lightweight and optimized codeset. Mine is just copy/paste/make it work type programming skills :-

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Also investigate CHF when things don't make your algo work smoothly. I think CHF plays a unique role in striking equilibrium (flight to risk situations). I could not figure this one out. There is something about it in the design that makes CHF unique. I have found even strength indicators to be unreliable for CHF pairs (after the peg was lifted)

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Trade frequency is proportional to the volatility. (Most of the time) But I also try to optimize the system in such way that it never reaches the limit for max open trades. My standard limit is no more than 15 open trades per pair at any time. And based on this rule I calculate my margin and trade sizes so that even if I have max open trades in all pairs I still have another 50% available margin. In other words I never use more than 50% of the margin. My system is not tick based. It's based on multiple millisecond timers! This way the CPU load is almost constant and the periods of high volatility does not affect the performance of the system too much.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Got it. Because of reversion to mean, a boundary is required for you to cap. Mine was mostly divergence from mean so it was far most aggressive in using available margin. If I had a free magin be one available even for one microlot, it would take the signal and trigger partial close when margin gets depleted squeezing every little bit of buying power made available to me I would also go in idle mode during low liquid times by closing trades that approach Breakeven ( not those in profit or loss) to free up margin and accommodate for the next volatile period (and there is one always happening around d the corner...i.e. do what market have to do to survive. Markets won't exist if there is no volatility :-) Anyways, good discussion bro. Keep us posted of your efforts. I will most likely resit this model when I retire to keep my mind occupied from collecting dust..lol

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I would say it depends. It depends on how far price moves from the mean in a trend and for ranging it depends on how many times it crosses back and forth across the mean. The trend is what kills me though with this method of reversion to the mean. In a trend it can be a long, long time before it gets back to where the first trades were made. Maybe years.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Recycle trades daily. Close all trades and pending @ 23:30 or 00:00

I understand that this can help! They have weekly settings!

@AO: Your proposition is that the overall market movement is constant. Right? Now let's consider a triangulated market with just 3 currencies A, B, and C. Then M(A) + M(B) + M(C) = const for 1 time unit (where M(X) is the sum of all movements of the currency X). Is this what you are saying or do I misinterpret/misunderstand your point? I've thought that whenever the currency pair AB moves strongly, AB, AC, and thus BC have to react (move) strongly, too.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Don't worry AO I perfectly understood where you were getting at ;-) When I realized the length of this coastline path was so long compared to the bird flight straight line I said to myself: "Oh F*** I want to be a market maker". But your question was about the relationship between this length and trend vs range. I expected to see something like "when the move is not so big while the path is already very long that's a range otherwise we avoid mean reversion". But the scatter plot doesn't show anything that clear cut. The path can be both very long or quite short for the same return. Sure when there is a very very long path (&gt;75000) the move is less than 200 pips but we can also see a 600 pip move with "only" 30000 "linear pips" (I don't know what to call that unit). If the price walks so long to go nowhere then necessarily ticks go up and down is a fairly well balanced way. If this is true at any scale (aka power law) it's not moving in zig-zag but much more randomly to form the fractal. How to capture even a fraction of that? The first obvious way is to grid. I mean at every pip. First problem: we pay the spread we don't pocket it. Anyway. In theory we should capture a big share of the length (linear in volatility). But we would also lose quadratically in the return. An average day is 58 pips return and 18980 linear pips. Let's say the grid catches'em all. If there was no spread/no comm. we would win 18980 pips thanks to the grid and only lose 1711 pips because of the move. Days with big return and short length will be much less fun. Say 500 return and 25000 linear. We get 25000 - 500*501/2 = -100250... That's 10K lost in a day using micro lots. Again: no spread/no comm. And that's the kind of day that echo across all the board.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Perfectly explained. Thanks

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Yes the grid is the tool. But not the operator! You need automated central control unit to manage these grids for 28 pairs. The control unit starts the gird at the right time, and stops at the right time. Otherwise the whole thing blows up on a regular basis. On average every 10-15 days the machine breaks. I suspect that the market makers initiate the "break switch" on pseudorandom intervals in order to prevent HFT machines like mine. BTW Look at the difference between these 2 charts. EURUSD vs GBPAUD What is the first thing you notice? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #465 ---
volatility, much higher with GA

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I'm not sure that the volatilities are very different. I think the larger fan out is an effect of scaling the chart vertically. What I see is that E/U and G/A charts are looking alike. When you long one you short the other?

--- 帖子 #467 ---
For the most part the volatility is proportional to the price. The pairs with low absolute price have the lowest volatility. Or at least the averages are very close. I pointed these 2 pairs specifically because from the whole pack of 28 these 2 are the 2 most "different" pairs! GBPNZD has almost identical properties to GBPAUD. All other pairs are placed in the middle between these 2. EURUSD has the most condensed cluster and GBPAUD has the most scattered. But in reality the difference is very small. If we leave the absolute range aside, the other characteristics are very similar for all pairs. What this means is that universal strategies exist. And these strategies can be optimized in such way that they can work equally well on all pairs! Something like the search for the common denominator!? At the same time, the pairs move in different directions at least 90% of the time (they have different PA shape) and this creates the effect which is necessary for the dynamic hedging model to work. If you constantly buy at the current lowest prices and sell at the current highest prices on all pairs, the equity curve becomes very stable. Often you can have huge exposure with many positions going against you, but the net PL simply fluctuates around 0. And so, if you take partial profits at fixed intervals you basically capture some percentage of the excess movement (randomly) while your equity stays flat. It's pretty much risk free profit. The bad news it that this model does not work all of the time! Occasionally (on average every 10-15 days) something in the market breaks and the balance in the equity disappears. In the worst case scenario you can end up with 7 really bad positions. And somehow the combined loss from these positions almost exactly equals the net profit accumulated during the stable period. Zero sum game??

--- 帖子 #468 ---
The conclusion so far is that mean reversion is almost inescapable (Like gravity) and this affect everything, including your equity which also occasionally reverts to the mean. So in order to beat the gravity, you have to (a)apply brute force or (b)find anti gravity technology. Both of these tasks are extremely difficult!

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Spot on brother. I would be very curious to see your results if you only flip the direction i.e leave everything as is and go fir divergence from mean. Try it man. you will learn a whole lot more about this superficial fiat market. The outcome would remain the same but it will give you more avenues to avoid "gravity"

--- 帖子 #470 ---
It is so amazing to see you are arriving at similar observations. Universal entries is the absolute necessary ingredient for any such balancing model to work imo. In the ocean of variablilities of every tick having the immense power to impact many pairs within the mathematically correlated currency model, one has to become the constant in actions and entries (and even exits but I found hard to do for both entries and exist so chose the universal entry route). What I also discovered is entry "setup" (the how!) does not matter 1) directional bias is maintained throughout the week (or day) 2) Divergence or Reversion is maintained throughout the week(or day) 3) Trading frequency "spacing" is maintained within the given scale across the span of extremities across entries and exits. By this, I mean the speed of entries somehow has to be in balance with the speed of exits (I am not talking HFT here). Price has to be removed from this aspect (atleast I did and it worked great if you know when to Idle and when to go full on throttle!) Once you track of EACH entry scale and manipulate the frequency (via TIME), you have a pretty decent tool at your disposal to remain "anti-gravitational" most of the time. It's that &lt;5% of situations that I could not figure out which takes the account (VERY quickly and rapidly) to negative expectancy which I believe you are also observing in your model. I have repeatedly mentioned throughout the year that my universal time action model has one or two such conditions that I am just unable to analyze the root cause. SOMETHING mysterious just happens out there (and I truly believe it HAS to be done arithmetically/algorithmically) that PREVENTS such balance to be achieved 100% of the time and I also think this is in place BY DESIGN to prevent any non-US economy to have an unfair advantage over the rest of the world. Without the availability of this feature (I call "intrinsic manipulation"), we would be seeing a whole lot of more Central Bank interventions imo. At the end, I just got burnt out, given my limited math skills and lack of fancy tools required to investigate further.

I understang what you are talking about and agree with your principles. Your robot is a way to play the game. I have been testing it and the results are possitive. There are many " I would like" but I like this system. Please put the number of entries in the setup. Thank you for sharing this robot and your great ideas

Great images and explanation AO ... still have limited Time to read all of your great posts, especially the Cycle &amp; Sqrt ... but will do it again soon after doing my homework , i hope ... Time to wish you &amp; all our good friends : a Merry Christmas 2018 &amp; Happy New Year 2019 !! may we all get much green pips in this coming year ... i hope it is not too late to congratulate, isn't it ??

Thank you Jagg for providing us the great indicator DRS_v1.2j. It works nice for past few months. But just after Christmas, I find all the band lines of the indicator in a little bit of chaos once the market reopen on 8:00 today. I guess it is due to the omission of hourly records before 8:00. Is there anyway to fix it? Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi Jagg I am in love with everything that smells like dax and in relation to the graphics that you post I have been looking at the image and sometimes it seems that you enter not only in the ATR lines but also among them, I understand with the sequence 1,1,1 , 2,2,2,3. I would like to ask you why those entries between the ATR lines. It would also be interesting to see how the robot behaves, being able to establish the departure of the ATR bands starting a one hours before the opening of Frankfurt. If you ever have time and try it, please tell us the results. I hope that one day you will be encouraged to publish the EA but I understand perfectly why not publish it. In any case, very interesting thread in relation with Normal or Gaussian distribution among other concepts. Regards.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Today it is back to normal.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
The EA takes the first entry only when we reach ATR band x (and I use e.g. ATR band 6 as a "chaos stop loss" to get out of all positions and don't do further buys/sells). All trades after that 1st one have nothing to do with the ATR bands, see post 1

hmm.. I have not shared my robot with anyone.... just thoughts, ideas, techniques, philosophies, and snippets of code.... but appreciate the feedback :-) Perhaps one day I will share the whole enchilada but not until I give it one more attempt down the road (outside of CrapT4) when I have free time and when I gain some machine/deep learning skills.

Looks like we are conjoined twins brother. My coast line principle is also based on the screenshot you posted. Not sure where you are with this journey but after numerous twist and turns, I ended up adding a "shoulder" to my pacific coast highway (your top portion of the range in the screenshot) to keep "pushing" centrifugally outward of the curb until a turnout/vistapoint occurs to make a U turn to travel inland. Doing this shit on one pair/time series quantitatively seems doable in theory and logic but extremely hard when factoring all the market variabilities. Still not perfect but getting there. Some days are like driving 90 mph taking perfect curves and some days, it crashes straight in the ocean lol

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I try to solve it by using the models described in this post. Quantify wich model we are in, cut the wrong one's and let the right one's continue and make up for the losses. So far so good, but i'm not sure if i'm there yet, need more confirmation.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Interesting way of classification of the market. Once a market is classified in a given cycle (i.e. daily cycle), a strategy for that model is activated for the day. The challenge is how to predict the model that we are in during the day. the following is a potential quantification algorithm that should be run at each bar in the day, in order to classify which dimension we are in: 1. T = total number of bars bars since day start (i.e. using 1m bars) 2. U = count how many breakouts to the upside 3. D = count how many breakouts to the downside 4. U% = 100 * U / T 5. D% = 100 * D / T 6. Identify the model as following: Smooth uptrend if: D% &lt; 1%, U% &gt; 30% Smooth downtrend if: U% &lt; 1%, D% &gt; 30% Ranging uptrend if: U% &gt; 1%, U% &lt; 20%, D% &lt; 1% Ranging downtrend if: D% &gt; 1%, D% &lt; 20%, U% &lt; 1% Ranging horizontal market if: U% &gt; 1%, U% &lt; 20%, D% &gt; 1%, D% &lt; 20% This algorithm can also be implemented on any market cycle (i.e. any candle, such as 8H, 4H, 1H, etc). The next step after implemention the above detection algorithm, is to: 1. decide what pattern to trade (some of the above or all of the above) 2. write strategies for each pattern 3. find a way to switch between patterns during the day, if the market changed direction let's implement this and see where it takes us.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Great stuff alpa! This morning my eur.chf trade was cut off, because an model 3 uptrend was detected. Sometimes the prediction is right sometimes not, but better be safe then sorry, the other trades make up for the loss and even made me some profit, so i'm happy the way it's going lately.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
hi Chake, nice stuff. it could be either model 3 uptrend, or model 2 ranging uptrend. perhaps it is too early to say

the collective brainpower we have among us is all we need to crack the market! Interesting way to quantify I must say. I have slept over this shit for way to long to understand that no matter what we do, there will always be some unique or weird market condition that will trigger the wrong algo causing a instant drawdown in our account and efforts. We have to think in terms of taking actions that accommodate all possible models/market conditions/patterns etc so here's where my head is.... Any of these three models require two actions... either divergence or reversion. We could do BOTH but I cannot find any way to make it work without time based filters. I consider price to be ALWAYS ranging or ALWAYS trending and I am a subscriber of this basic principle. I don't care what patterns or models price is making over time. The change in SCALE is what determines whether it is ranging or trending. Range expansion from the first tick of session open is trending.... scale expansion when range has developed and broken is also a trending state (trend continuation by definition is trending condition) in my opinion. But I have tried both Divergence only and reversion only and both cause drawdowns as expected when there are dislocations in price movement which obviously are unpredictable as to when they will occur to switch our algo from Diverge to Revert. That is the key to our problems in my opinion.... and not to predict or anticipate what phase the market is in or going into. The holy grail is the understand and devise a fantastic quantified model which will remain agnostic to changing market conditions and "ADAPT" to any predefined model shown in his screenshots. It is a bit scary how AO and I have taken two completely different routes (mine being Divergent and his being Reversion) and arrive to the same conclusions. It has been relatively easy to do this across 28 pairs as we have the tools like correlation, currency strength etc at our disposal. Doing this model on just one time series on one pair is VERY HARD.... I would say impossible but I am not there yet to make that claim. This is what I have been doing for last 3 months with NQ. one pair, one timeframe, 4 divergent algos. 4 reversion algos, 1 pullback/bounce and then apply brute force at each tick to pick up which algo picks and take the trade.... this way, I am not relying or anticipating which market model to go with. All I am doing is taking the right actions based on divergent or reversion setup and let price be my guiding principle.... all good in theory but very hard to maintain a consistent positive outcome. I am not giving up on this fascinating area of research. This CAN be cracked imo. Last night I wrote a 2 page post (which I lost in my thread) describing 3 more research projects that I am adding to my long term bucket list :- EDIT: And if I may add, the holy grail is understanding the "Opportunity Cycle Theorem" that I have mentioned a 1000 times in my thread. It is the universal thread that connects everything in one place across all these unlimited (not just 3) models of market making patterns. You would be starring that charts for next 30 yrs if there is no concrete understanding of the underlying uniformity that exists in everything around us. It's the Pi or fibo or gann or elliott or chaos or fractal or whatever. It is the universal form of denomination that exists that we all overlook.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Hi AO, please allow to ask some questions: I basically means, that most prices are often returned during the lifetime of a day, doesn't it? This somehow reminds me on Eurusdd's "transience and recurrence" - no worries, I don't think that betting on the recurrence for a particular price value isn't you key to success. But maybe applying some ranging market strategies?! I think this is the reason why you concluded here that ranges are more often than ranges with drift and far more often than smooth trends. What do you mean with "balance out"? I could think about two explanations: The sum of the coastlines of the FX majors is almost constanct (if we compare two [almost] consecutive days) plus an error. Then balancing out could mean that if there is a very small coastline on some pairs but the coast lines of the other pairs almost reached their expected daily level, you can expect that the lagging pairs catch up since there only very few occassions of very big coast lines (the single points on the far right of PipMeUp's image ). The three possible categories of days (as explained in your post linked above) will have reached a state so that the category is identifiable till noon. Then we could focus on trading applying the correct strategy for the corresponding category. (I think this opportunity isn't very likely.) Is one of it correct? Which one? Thanks, AC

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I have a theory here to share.... but please keep in mind, all my "theories" are completely based on what I have seen via screentime or via quantified research so I will share something interesting. Unfortunately my math and coding skills are not as great so hoping someone can prove me either right or wrong. I am responding to this post but in general applies to all your posts here on this thread and primarily comment on "capture small percentage of this total excess length" below but please note that it applies to 1) one pair 2) one timeframe only i.e. a price vs time series 3) only one trade open at a time 4) only one microlot The "small percentage" has to be less than the total high/low range for a strategy to have long term merit. Anytime the profitable pipcount increases the high/low range (what I refer in my terminology as the OCRange), a)you got lucky and caught the trend b) market is throwing a fat tail distribution 'allowing' you to make a profit. The moment you exceed this range, market forces will double up against your will to make more. Now, there is a catch in the above statement and none of you have discussed the fact that Range is a homogeneous organism that is every changing and is never fixed (or should never be considered a "fixed range"). In my definition, there is never a Fixed Ranging market even if you are able to draw a straight horizontal line. If it is not obvious why, market events can and will always happen unannounced breaking the range into shreds along with any "fixed" logic you put in place to enforce the range criterion. In my view, it will work but only upto the point when you decide to STOP trading after your goal is reached and with this statement also, there is a catch... how do you define a goal when the range is not there yet. Gathering all these elements in a basket, shaking it up side down and sideways, the only technique I can come up with has to have the ingredients that does not depending on "market conditions". It has to be agnostic. It has to be neutral. It should have no effect on when you start or stop or where you enter or exit.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Have you tried to apply this heuristic principle in trading? looks legit..

--- 帖子 #500 ---
It's the right way to go about it. First need to ascertain the occurrence of the trades while looking back from : datetime to: DateTime Find occurrences based on a threshold of xxxx pips using xxxxxBars . At least 1,000 pips are produced on a daily basis based on 10 pip size. The machine moving between high and low of say 150 pips is actually producing 100 trades of 10 pips size while moving up and down. We have to target at least 30% of it daily. 30 trades of 10 pips will be 300 pips positive and 150 pips negative. Nett gain on each day 150 pips.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Ideally an EA should trade randomly buying and selling. Driven by some Momentum Driver. I have done it manually and currency strength in pure form (not averaged) worked well. 100 trades , each of 10 pip size , are shot between daily high low range of 150 pips. As a result of screen-watching and executing trades manually my back suffered and now I can't sit for more than 10 minutes on the PC. Manual trading for me is out for ever. If EA is fed with currency strength logic, Momentum is triggered in instalments. You have to be direction neutral. Direction bias only when you are sure of timing. Ideal candidates will be mean-reverting symbols. Should correct by 40% at least in a week. Hedged broker platform will be ideal . 95% negatively correlated pair also should be traded to control drawdown.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Yes, I have applied this principle and proven the theory works.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
can you elaborate more on the "randomly buying and selling" vs "momentum driver". perhaps if you can write the strategy in clear forms so we can understand the logic in it.

Hi AO, Same question as alpha. And if you do still trade it, how did you do today? I was doing ok, but today was a bad day, a lot of runners in oposite direction from initial trade (aud and eur crosses).

--- 帖子 #510 ---
It's been a while since we've heard from you AO. Are you still trading this strategy? Keen to find out your progress!

--- 帖子 #511 ---
It's relatively easy to achieve gains from random movements if there's only a slight tendency to revert to the mean. Simulating an instrument with a mean exchange rate of 1.0 and random variations and applying a very simple "sell when quote rose by 0.3%" and "buy when quote fell by 0.3%" yields a result like the one below. Attached Image (click to enlarge) (btw it's intersting to see how many well known patterns appear in such a randomly simulated price series: trend channels, s+r lines, shs, ...) Doing it 1000 times and overplotting the equity curves shows that it is actually quite a safe approach, more so when averaging ovear a number of instruments. Attachment g The disadvantage is that you can't leverage too much, otherwise the thing explodes.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Looking at the dips in equity - are you applying a grid-based approach similar to what AO does?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
The original rules that AO set in the beginning of the thread has an edge. I'm not sure how many of you have been able to successfully adopt some of the ideas here into your own strategies. If you find yourself stuck, do not give up. It does not seem like the thread has any meaningful discussion left, I have taken my own studies outside of this forum but for whoever is still on this, keep at it. You can DM me if you would like to discuss further. All the best guys!

--- 帖子 #514 ---
It's really as simple as I wrote above and not optimized in any way. Also, it's not tied to any specific hour as AO's original scheme, it keeps going on forever whenever price moved by another 0.3% in any direction. So yes, it's grid-based somehow, but the grid is newly set up each time a trade has been made.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I made it to Page 16 tonight. I have to get to bed though. I have been testing Money management using a coin flip simulator. I think people get it wrong by only focusing on R:R and going 1:2 1:3 etc. That can maximize an effective system, but you have to have effective control over money flow itself regardless of increased R:R. All that to say.. I'll catch up on the thread, and maybe we (Mfeldt and Carddard) can add some better money management to this and see what it does to the equity curve? If you give me a 50/50 system, I can make money with it without increasing R:R.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
To me, this is the key to success. Making money from coin flips is safe + sound. Imagine betting on a stock market index: You can be sure it will not fall to zero. You can flip a coin at each point and decide whether it will rise by a certain percentage, or fall. Now you can e.g. always enter with 1% of your equity when the index drops by 1%, and pull out 1% when it rises by 1%. This system will always make money and never fail! The problem, is you can not leverage, and most of the time you'll make less money than with a simple buy+hold! Now you can try to come up with something smart that allows shorting, but it will naturally be less safe as upwards there's no limit for the index! Or you can go to forex, where you essentially trade (at least) the ratio of two indexes (aka currencies). The ratio will also never fall to zero, but here you can be sure that also the reverse ratio will also not fall to zero, i.e. there now is effectively also a limit to any upward movement. Now you need to find a good model to generate movements from coin flips, and then play with MM parameters (e.g. leverage, entry+exit sizes, hedging if you like, ...). Once you find something that makes decent money, you can pretty safely enter the market without going through any test on real data (which, in contrast to thousands of generated series will always be only one specific realization!).

AD, using your suggestion, at which point (e.g. after 2 hours into the start of trading cycle): would you determine which dimension we're in?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
i think 4 hours is a good start, or perhaps use min of 50% ADR is reached during the day, then start classifying. no point trading a very narrow session. to be avoided at all times. george from tma thread uses the min adr, which i found to be useful for trading current day, or current session.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
To make sure I am understanding this right, are you saying that one could use the following ways to quantify the "state" of the market using your defined rules: 1) State of the market would be obtained during the 1st 4 hours of market open (i.e. at 00:00 hrs) - This gives me about 8 hours left to open trades (if mid cycle hour = 12) 2) Once 50% ADR has been reached (could be within 1st hour or 6th hour of market open), state of the market would be obtained Or perhaps a combination of both, whichever comes first?

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Either of the 2 conditions is fine; for example; if the market reached a 50% ADR in the first hour; it is up for something sinister; see for example 24th June 2016; during Brexit vote count. After you have started classifying the market; you need to re-do the classfication all day long, at every 1minute bar. If the market changed from trending to ranging; trade it accordingly; basd on your algo for that type of market. We don't know how the market will behave; sometimes it changes from ranging to trending, and vice versa during the day. Some quants uses pattern recognition machine learning algorithm to classify the market regime intraday; based on past pattern pre-selected by the user for the AI to learn from it. however; I have gone that route and spent lots of time on it; and beleive me it is not worth the hours. It's better to use simple classification algorithm; like the one mentioned above.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Have you tried successfully implementing your classification algorithm on AO's mean reversion method?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I didn't have a chance to implement it or test yet

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I've been looking for an ADR indicator like this one. I like to work within statistics.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I gave this a go last night. I had to modify the percentages though, to make them more realistic. I tried variations of implementing the quantification algorithm - for e.g., using it as an additional filter for entries or exits. Couldn't seem to find an additional edge because of this. Maybe there's a better way for me to utilize this.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
What did you modify them to?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Tested a few ranges. I noticed that the percentages do not differ too much. I increased the 20% to 25% and the 1% is no longer relevant. The difference between the 2 percentages is more important, I realised.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Yeah, 50 seems high unless you're taking a small target with a big stop loss, but then that topic had already been brought up here I see, back in the first few pages. You might have to explain more how you used the difference.. but I was going to type more on my earlier comment, but held back to see what you said first.. Anyway.. That is why I posted the ADR % concept in that picture. I believe the best way to go.. added filter also or not, is to take a percent of the ADR and then take a move of that. If 90% of days are over 64 pips and 50% are over 108.. that sure tells me something. Simple filters should take care of the bouncing points, then enter the trades at the extremes, 2 positions, one for the near term ADR target, move stop to BE and then the other for a larger percent of the range. I think I would shoot for 65% of the time for probability sake, and then take half of that move from the HOD or LOD plus bounce filter as the entry. I don't care where or when it bounces as well.. as long as I am already in the trade in the opposite direction, and it's finally going to make the move to the larger percent of the ADR. So trend or range doesn't matter. Anyway, what percentage difference worked the best? you can PM me if this is all hush hush or something.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
It doesn't matter. There is no additional edge. It could be good for other uses I'm not sure if it adds incremental value to AO's strategy.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
i did quick test, and you are right. it does not seem to help at all

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I think you may be right. Every time I go to try and make His system work, I end up with.. pretty much a whole new system. That's happened like 3 times. I know for sure the original system wouldn't work as is.. or even with that one small tweak. Question is.. how far away from it do you guys want to get and still call it the same system? This was the latest. I used volume waves, m and w formations, and an MTF ATR grid set at 14per and 20%. Not exactly The same system.. But I guess I kind of put them all in the same category. Strictly or blindly keying off of the high or low doesn't make sense to me. So we can add PA, volume, and bounce TA type filtering a few different ways and change the furthest from the original system. Or.. I still think the easiest is a hedge sort of formula. All I would need to know is the accuracy rating of the system before/between the huge draw down days. Then I think we could Use a hedge system, limit scaling in to like 3.. have B/E point and make sure the streaks outpace he hedge losses and the hedge captures the big move days. Take some tweaking, but that is the only way I see it happening based on pure math without going down the pair correlation path that the others seem to have traveled.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I did some statistical analysis of price movement after a breakout of x pips from the daily range. Negative values means the price retraced on average. Positive values means the price continued in the same direction of the move. here is the result for EURUSD; from 2011 todate. Some observations from the chart: - There is a negative correlation between the day's range and retracement; which means; the larger the value; the more likely it will retrace - On average; EURUSD reverses course after a 150 pips of daily range; which is interesting to know. This means EURUSD tends to continue the move if the price range is below 150 pips. - As the day range approaches 200 pips; there is an edge there; the average reversal movement is 20 pips

--- 帖子 #536 ---
AUDUSD has higher reversal rate compared to EURUSD GBPUSD is a breakout beast; don't attempt to fade it!!!! You are better off trading breakout strategies on GBPUSD especially after 200 pips range GBPCAD is even worse than GBPUSD; never fade that monster! EURCHF is also bad for fading NZDUSD is perhaps the best for fading so far

--- 帖子 #537 ---

Have you tested this with tick data ? or at least taking the spread of each pair into account?

Jagg, here is the analysis on DAX I don't have price data for Dow at the moment.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
So the Average reversal over the 150pip ATR is less than 20%?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
its 20 pips average

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Right. Just interesting that it's such a small percentage reversion. Speaks to me of the margin of inefficiency/volatility in the market. It's an interesting point. Side thought.. Could we work backward from that average and figure out which mean it is respecting/reverting to and draw it? I have another point on that about market structure.. but I am working on another way to show it. I'm good with ideas.. bad with words and pictures. ha

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Keep in mind that the context of the study above is we enter at the specified range, then exit at EOD. another way of looking at this, is to study the excursions after the breakout, measure the average retracements. those retracements is where the edge might be, because the strategy discussed in this thread, exits intraday. shoot your ideas, and lets see where we can go. it is important to do the studies that finds the edge.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Okay. So I'm a visual person, I'm semi following your statistics. I actually think the edge might be before that, but might be able to utilize that information. Do you guys mind if I post 4-5 chart shots/pictures?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I attached pictures to explain something and I think with your smarts, you can make something out if it. Every day has a structure to it, and I bet you could do a scan for the percentage of days that follow the structure very closely. It's definitely the majority if not practically all days. And there is a good reason. This structure encompasses and contains pretty much all of the concepts talked about so far in this thread. Principle 1 Every day the market forms what looks like a heart beat wave. And between each day there is a period of consolidation. (see structure.jpg) The reason every day forms one of the variations, is because that is what a candle looks like. There are only so many different candles. They all fit into 7 basic categories, but assuming I didn't forget one.. they all really fit into 4 bars because 3 are the same just the inverse. Also.. if you think about it.. it is easy to identify by drawing a line at the top quarter of the bar, and a line at the lower quarter of the bar. The open and close are just variations of being in one of these three sections. (see candles.jpg) So.. all of the candle within a candle stuff.. fractals of time and price movement, Atr of different structures, interplay in these 2 concepts. Picture 1 and picture 2 show how easy it is to find this structure every day. picture 9 and 10 I had to look for and are harder days to see, but they are still very tradeable as you can see. There are many many conclusions to be drawn from this very simple way of seeing the market for what it really is. If you want just some of my ideas.. it would be like this.. Every day the market cannot keep moving. People rest.. it has to rest.. banks don't push the market 24 7 because they need the market to bounce around so they can accumulate and distribute their volume. Also.. there is time between the trading sessions where things die down. So you can see the consolidation on the daily cycle happens at about the same time every day and this resets the market structure the majority of the time. Market maker and bank behavior is clearly seen without even using volume! They consolidate.. stop hunt, push the market, take profit, it retraces, consolidates.. and does it all over again the next day. This is all reflected in each daily candle and the daily fractal structure builds into their larger position moves. M and W formations can be seen on the smaller fractal levels and on any time frame. They always happen at reversal points in the heart beat structure. So you can see them coming. What the AO system got right.. is that the banks usually move the market in relation to HOD and LOD of either the current day, or the previous 1-3 days. Why? Because they stop hunting and absorbing positions so they can move the market. What does this tell us? I'm sure you guys already see it.. but that first wave out of consolidation is almost never what we are trading. sort wave, long wave, short wave. We want to trade the longer waves. So alphadude, you can see where your info factors in right? I mean.. if I read what you wrote correctly. After a long leg that extended the range.. you statistically showed what the last return wave of the heartbeat structure is before EOD right? If you can do that.. I believe you have the capability to show how to filter the beginning impulse wave, to catch the major heartbeat move. I don't cherry pick stuff.. that orange expanding wave is all we really need to be able to trade effectively. I noticed the consolidation period is always somewhat relational to a % of the daily ATR. I used a daily atr grid set at 14 and .2. So each line is .2 of the daily ATR. I noticed that the wave that forms the first small wave of the heartbeat can bounce around, but the actual first leg will be between 1 and 2x the width of the consolidation and at least .2 of the daily ATR. I think with your smarts, you can test to see which ratios and fractions are most ideal, and we can construct a system that self adapts. The trickiest part will be automating the consolidation range accurately. If that is drawn too big or too small due to automated inefficiency, it would be off. We need to filter the wave size, and focus on testing and stop hunting the highs and lows of the consolidation and or the HOD LOD. They are typically in the same areas, but not always, and a statistic to show the strength of convergence, if any, would help. The ramifications are pretty deep in regards to the fractal rabbit hole of all of that, and how you could auto trade.. but hopefully that all made sense and was pretty simple to see. So.. what do you guys think? Want to work together on it?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Filtering the Wave Size

--- 帖子 #550 ---
There is a simple answer to your questions; checkout this thread about "London close strategy". It does exactly what you are asking for. It fades the day range; but at specific time of day; when consolidation is expected; and also it fades it at the extreme points. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=12354771

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Thanks. I'm familiar with the strategy. Kind of forgot about it though. Except for that guy's youtube commercials about the London Daybreak strategy. haha. I mean.. I guess if simple works.. But I think I would rather filter and have tight stops and not fade if I don't have to. Maybe it's a personal hang up, but I think I would rather be right, than guess.. but maybe that is idealism. My other hobby is tinkering with random entry systems to still make money. so.. anyway Also though.. and probably the biggest reason.. is you can scale the concept up or down, and not just fade a daily movement, but larger and lower fractals. The consolidation happens on the one hour chart and is a similar structure but different. But scalping and building up into the larger movements might actually be the safest and most effective. Lastly.. what was AO's original method if not scaling/trying to fade into trades? So it really just depends which way you guys want to take it.. if any. It looks like you could take this concept, slap AO's system and some better money management into it and it would work pretty flawlessly. If you could slap fractal recognition into it and building into larger candles somehow.. that would be pretty next level. But that would be a pretty long project. So I guess the question is, where do you want the thread to go? Do we want to build something that works and exit the way that those earlier in the thread did, when they figured it out.. or.. is it dead?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thanks @parisboy. I'm actually a big fan of your channel stuff. I think it's a very effective way to trade. I read a similar book quite a few years ago. I could geek out with you all day long about patterns and stuff. I've forgotten most of it, so it will be a fun read. Honestly though, why I stopped, is because at the time.. I found that volume and order flow is all that moves the market. People act in predictable patterns, and will until everyone figures out volume and they have to switch their money grabbing methods. Long story short.. I didn't need all the patterns, and it just cluttered my chart. In other words.. if I know price is going to bounce here.. and if it does.. it goes to point B, if it doesn't it goes to point C.. then I just trade those and don't get caught in the middle. You know? I could see a value in auto pattern recognition and building that into smaller time frames on a scalping basis. Because price moves too fast at that level to analyze 10 different patterns on multiple pairs. I can pretty much trade naked. Add volume and I can tell you exactly what's going on in the market. Pattern recognition, in my experience and opinion, is best used for probability analysis and mechanically trading in an auto system if you want added levels of complexity. Range and trend really don't matter in the scheme of things. All we really need is for the market to move. We just want to predictably catch a set or predictably variable movement. I think your envelopes do a good job of doing that.

Hi Reteid2222, I hope your staying safe. I sent you a PM concerning this post. To understand your properly, just for example sakes, you said 1) 150 emas applied to high and low, that I understand. What I don't understand is the "with distance 2". What do you mean when you say"with distance 2?" 2) How did you get that center ema line? emas applied to high and low dont have a center line? 3) lastly, those number on top of the candle, what do they represent? Thank you for your response and please dont see it as a stupid question. I'm just trying to learn. Thamk you.

Nowadays most of the fx move happen due to unscheduled news and political reason. That news and movement we can't predict before it happens.

I spent a whole day by carefully moving page by page .Its very interesting and a simplest method to follow &amp; implement . Unfortunately no active participant ..Really ..really useful thread ..

--- 帖子 #573 ---
A simplest way to compare this thread to nature circle(cycle ).. We can divide the day by two portions ( day /night). .which is 24/2= 12 hours each.. further dividing we can get ( day,evening ,night ,midnight).. which means 24/4=6 hours in a session(sections) 6hour *60 min= 360 min (360 degree is a circle ).. for example if the market time ( your exchange open to close time) is 10 hours .. mid section comes at 5 hours from start &amp; each section is 2.5 hours .. this may help you how to use this system ..

Please would you mind to release the source code.

Also for better observation on any market, could the spread indicator being modified for display as line of values over time It would be wonderful if you could implement that to see if spread analysis helps ... If you have not much time and I have the source, I can ask another forum to see it modified Please please please ...

I am using the indicator for microanalysis and using my brain to generate signals. The return is 350% in a year. The brain generates the signals, not the information indicator. It is the best tool for microanalysis of the auction market movements. My brain is happy with a single tool. Now I am looking for a second tool to help control drawdown and give me a solid auto-pilot tool for margin management. Just two tools are enough for my manual trading.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
My understanding was that the levels are chosen based on the assumption that price does a random walk. With a random walk you expect the maximum excursion from the day open price to expand as sqrt(t), hence the indicator shown in post #7 . To verify that assunption, I analysed the EURUSD M5 bars of the last two years. Graphs use percentiles instead of averages to better filter out noise due to extreme outliers. Between yellow and green is 1 sigma, between red and blue is 2 sigma. First I calculated where the current relative price was during the day: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, this does not look like sqrt(t) at all. Next I calculated the maximum excursion from the daily open price: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Apparently the EURUSD is not likely to make a new high/low after 19:00 when the curve flattens, but again no sqrt(t) profile. Can someone explain why sqrt(t) is used?

Hey all, Ever since I came across this thread I started thinking of ways to actually make profit in the market without using technical analysis--which, besides analyzing MAs speed/acceleration/convergence/divergence, feels like pure astrology to me-- and fundamental/sentiment analysis--which, at a retail level, feels very hard to get a complete grasp on. I have actively been trying to decrypt alphaomega's messages in this thread on mean reversion. I personally tried to understand what he meant through those messages, overall I had a few ideas but nothing I really fully trust per my experience. Before I delve into it, I'd like to say one thing; I don't feel like laying down cryptical messages on this forum is of any help to anyone. I fully understand how someone who has an edge on the market would not want to share it. But then, no need to spread mystical stuff that could mean everything and its opposite on such a forum. It's not particularly encouraging or helping anyone (which would be the purpose of the forum to begin with); as a matter of fact, stating plain truths like "price moves during the day and usually does not close at open level; only a professional like me is able to understand this" is quite pretentious as a statement to begin with and has no business in helping other members here. At first, we discussed about buying/selling when price exceeds a certain threshold (given by a price diffusion model proportional to t^1/2), betting that the price always reverts back to the mean. I feel like this assumption is not completely true; locally, there might be a mean reversion process happening, but on a bigger scale, one instrument's properties such as mean or deviation has no reason to stay stable. Then, we discussed about the "coastline" vs. daily return. This part is very interesting; realizing how much movement there is on a daily basis vs. how much the open-close difference usually stands at is eye-opening on the market mechanics. Alphaomega stated that his strategy is to capture a fraction of that massive pip movement in between the open and the close of a given daily candle; when asked if martingale/grid is involved in his system, he says that there is no grid in his system but then, a few posts later, he says " grid is the tool "... Finally, there has been discussion around the fact that the market balances to 1. In which way exactly? For example, if you went to buy 1 EURUSD, sell 1 GBPUSD and sell x EURGBP (depending on current quotes) you would end up with a neutral instrument minus spread; the fact that it's neutral would be temporary as quotes always change (so this instrument would end up drifting and being more exposed to a certain currency overtime). Is the strategy simply buying the whole 28 currencies betting that it's equivalent to a heavily ranging instrument, on which we can use strategies such as grids (that assume the underlying instrument won't trend in time)? That would involve paying so much spread that I feel like it's not the right path. Also, I might miss something: do we have statistical proof that buying on current lows and selling on current highs during the first half of the day (or whatever first n hours) and closing at EOD on all instruments is profitable? What are your thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi marengo, I coudn't dercypt alphaomega's messages in every detail either, but as an algo-trader, they gave me some valuable hints for my search for statistical edges. I would like to comment two of your statements: At least for Forex, my statistical evaluations and tests tell me, that mean reversion strategies mostly have a better edge than trend following ones. It seems, that the old economic rule "low prices attract buyers and high prices attract sellers" is still valid in the long run. I coudn't find any edge until now in buying/selling extreme values in the first x hours of the day.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I would also add that he said he was using multiple (at least 4) different strategies at the same time, on all instruments and all “directions”. My guess is that such a heavy trading setup is such that drawdowns would be compensated by other wins but this is not necessarily the case; for this to be a true statement, drawdowns need to happen enough, below a threshold that is lower than what most of us expect there. He said he gave description of his 1st system (sort of reversion to the mean thing) and hints on the others (“3 models” of the market being range, sub-trend and trend—which, to this day, are still not identifiable until they happen). Or maybe this was all fake to begin with?

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I'm sure you find other things. What if mean is dynamic?

GU 2010-2021 Initial lot size: 0.2 Yes, the DD is huge compared with initial deposit. But, yet again it's profitable. It will be incredible if the huge losses controlled.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Thanks for the info. Based on post #108 these levels would be between 0.1 and 0.15 * ADR * sqrt(hour +1). Time for some experimentation...

--- 帖子 #600 ---
should be 1/34 to 1/2 * ADR * sqrt(hr+1)

--- 帖子 #601 ---
There's no edge selling/buying in the first x hours of the day. But you can find the edge when you can identify the value (undervalued/overvalued) of certain instrument, but that under/over valuation returns to the fair value/mean within short-term. Sometimes the value offer very good opportunity (like 100 pips), and sometimes few pips. As a proof of my word, look at USDCAD. The fair value is 1.34, but according to volatility and time fair value can change a little up/down. At least here 100 pips can be grabbed. Cheers And this leads to that if someone can't identify the worth/value, how someone know where the mean is?!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
The simplest solution is to calculate mean of N last observations and use it in mean reversion strategy but this is MA-divergence strategy at its core, maybe playing with weights or window size will help but overfitting is likely at some stage.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I have already solution for this Nothing to do with MA

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Care to elaborate? I am confused…

--- 帖子 #605 ---
I mean it has nothing to do with averaging

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Also do you pay attention other pairs are trending while USDCAD is ranging? Because it should hit the mean And pay attention if UCAD breaks today's low first, be ready to see 1.34 If it breaks first today's high, be ready to see 1.36332 UCAD

Disclosure: I don't trade with AO's method. But I've been a follower of his posts for years. I have tested, analyzed but haven't gone live with his methods before. AO's thread has fascinated me for so long. His messages are quite cryptic indeed, but he's also shared plenty of interesting nuggets that may help you with your trading. He's pretty much laid out the entire system in the first few pages of the post, albeit with obvious flaws when a major trend hits. He's suggested filtering out major news events, and optimizing the mid cycle hour according to each pair. I'm personally not a fan of filtering out major news events and optimizing the hour, but there may be merit in that. I have recently jumped back into analyzing AO's content, and here's what I will share: 1) The 3 market models that he proposed exist indeed. Find a way to mechanically classify each day into each market model. I have simplified them into just 2 models. Ranging days (Including flat ranging days and ranging days with a directional drift), and trending days (Trending days with a directional drift). 2) How the market moves determines when it is the best time for you to enter into a mean reversion strategy. (What kind of mean-reverting strategy doesn't seem to be material. The key is the filter, not the actual strategy itself). 3) AO's original trading rules can act as a decent mean-reverting strategy. You can use your own methods to test out the efficacy as well. Combine 1, 2 and 3.
