Description of my trading system ″Andrew Forex″ Currency pair: any, but better cross-pairs that give good trends. Time frame: any, but usually 4-hour Indicators: supertrend, nonlagdot (value: 20) Entry rules Buy: a dot of Nonlagdot changes from red to blue. At the same time dots of nonlagdot should be above the Supertrend line. Also the Supertrend line should be green. A position should be opened by execution of a pending order. The order is placed on the upper point of the market extremum, which is formed after the first rebounce of the market downward (when closing price is lower than previous one). That is one should wait untill the price has exceeded the point of extremum, and only then buy. However, if the price fails to exceed the level of the point of extremum, one should wait. After the formation of a new point of the market extremum, the order should be shifted to that point. If the color of nonlagdot or supertrend changes to red, the order shoud be canceled. Sell: a dot of Nonlagdot changes from blue to red. At the same time dots of nonlagdot should be under the Supertrend line. Also the Supertrend line should be red. A position should be opened by execution of a pending order. The order is placed on the lower point of the market extremum, which is formed after the first rebounce of the market upward (when closing price is higher than previous one). That is one should wait untill the price has exceeded the point of extremum, and only then sell. However, if the price fails to exceed the level of the point of extremum, one should wait. After the formation of a new point of the market extremum, the order should be shifted to that point. If the color of nonlagdot or supertrend changes to blue, the order shoud be canceled. Market entries without placing pending orders are not recommended. Pending orders for market entries are placed with the regard of the amount of the spread and additional 3 pips. Exit rules I exit when: 1. The price touches the Supertrend line, or 2. The Supertrend line changes its color, or 2. The price touches the first line of the Fibonacci fan . The Fibonacci fan is constructed from the point of the market extremum at the beginning of its movement and up (or down) to the opposite extreme point of the current market, that is, from the bottom to the top of the movement (when buying) and from the top of the movement to the bottom (when selling). It is important not to confuse: the Fibonacci fan is constructed not from the market entry point, but from the point of the beginning of directional movement or trend (up or down). Fibonacci fan line, which is closest to the price, serves as the exit level. And the exit order should be moved on this line. Stop-loss is set: 1. On Supertrend line, or 2. Below near price swing, or 3. Under (over) the closest extremum of the market, which exceeds the Supertrend line in the opposite direction. Stop-loss order is placed with the regard of the amount of the spread and additional 3 pips. The following m oney management is recommended: either not more than 10% of the capital per trade, or a progressive system (e.g. Fibonacci or semi-martingale). Martingale is not recommended because it is far too risky in case of the lack of capital after several consecutive losing trades. Adding is recommended solely to profitable positions after the regular change of Nonlagdot color in the direction of the current trend.

Andrew, Thanks for sharing. Looks like a clean, simple system. Signing up for further study..... A couple of questions: 1. Don't you think 10% per trade is a little extreme? 2 .What's your experience of E/U, G/U with this? Thanks, Kostas.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Does the super trend indicator lag? And how much pips do you average weekly?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Very true, virtually every indicator out there can do well when it's trending. I was thinking of using with support and resistance and fibs in some way, it looks very useful for entrys, but gotta demo test it over a good period to be sure if its any good.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Or put up a picture of a ranging market then we can all learn more in how to trade/avoid trading when market isn't so pretty

--- 帖子 #6 ---
The Trend Magic indy refurbished, good indy for showing the trend....

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Give the guy a break, he is just trying to share his method of trading and help others. Obviously anyone can pick a nice chart but why would he want to choose a messy/rangy chart to illustrate how his system works , not how it doesn't work. Fair play to you Andrew, looks like a simple and easy to understand system so keep posting all your trades then people can decide if they wish to use it. Cheers Foggytrader

--- 帖子 #8 ---
If Sim you have a better trading method that can trade both trending and ranging, I suggest you going ahead to open a thread to share it to the world and I would be the 1st to take part... or else be just be a silent observer like many others do. Thanks Andrew for sharing...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
To both of u. As said before, anyone can pick those charts and put a simple MA cross and you'd both be in awe...at least put 1 ranging 1 trending surely? Or one of you do it instead of living in the fantasy world that it's always gonna trend like that

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Andrew, Thanks for sharing your system. I found that it shows good results on 1h time frame as well, as 4h chart is not the same on every broker platform. Thanks. Knez

--- 帖子 #11 ---
These indicators are repaint?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
thanks andrew its a great system i think with discipline and good mm(pyramiding) its a winner

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks to everybody who approves the system! I've been working it out very thoroughly. I have come to a conclusion the system must be simple and effective without unnessary additional bugs and troubles. The market should be seen clearly to trade and give the predicted profit. This system includes, as you noticed, two indicators: Supertrend and Nonlagdot. They do not repaint and do not lag except for the current candle (bar), as well as any other indicator (including the moving average, Stochastic or RSI)! Otherwise, I do not see any reason to develop the trading system with repainting indicators. As for criticism, please, give the constructive criticism for the benefit of all the participants. And do not forget about money management and diversification of assets! It supports essentially and helps to go through "the hard times" without unexpected problems. This system can be effective in trading different currency pairs. In confirmation of my words I give the whole of my trading desk at this time.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Andrew I have attached both indicators to my chart. but could not load template on it. is it mandatory or these two indis is sufficient?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
See the image. Go to your broker's directory. [1] Store the tpl into "templates" [2&amp;3] Then store both mt4 into "experts\indicators" Hope the above help.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hello Andrew As a newbie, at times I am not clear about the terms being used. What do you mean by "better cross-pairs that give good trends?" How about E-U, G-U, G-J and E-J that I am demo trading with? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Andrew I wish to have a better understanding about your entry. Your clarification or input is much appreciated. Pls. refer the image attached for a sell entry in E-U. Are my understanding (drawing) correct based on your trading guide for both new entry and add entry as shown? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Andrew, Trying showing more LIVE trades...rather than PAST trades.. (That means..post your chart's pic when u enter a trade and post a another pic when u close that trade).... http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jWNhyMUpjS...s400/kitty.jpg Sonic

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Andy, does the nonlag dots re-paint? Meaning if current bar registered a red dot, will this particular bar change to a blue dot after several bars later?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Please refer to post #13.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Though that way of adding would be a little bit not exactly according to the system (because one can add after the regular change of Nonlagdot color but not just after the regular rebonce) but, I think, it can be used too. But the better way for adding is to wait untill the regular change of Nonlagdot color and confirm the signal by the next rebounce (if there is no strong trend). Anyway if you placed that pending order to add to the position, now, I recommend to cancel it, because at the present moment the Nonlagdot has changed its color, and the moves against the trend. In such situation one should wait until the change of Nonlagdot color and the following rebounce. Only after execution of those requirements I would add to the position (if I did not exit before by take-profit order). Otherwise I would recommend to cancel previously placed pending orders for adding and to wait. Now on EUR is going in the indefinite movement (Nonlagdot is blue while Supertrend is red).

Hello Andrew Thanks for your reply. Perhaps, due to my novice skill, I need some illustrations, if you may, to fully understand the entry and rebound. The video is good. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
compare the color changing of the "supertrend" and also I think the non lag dots change color just as the "trendtool" indy does, so? they seem to do the same thing...

Good work andrew!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Andrew, I want to thank you for all the hard work you have put into sharing your system and your great generosity. Chango

--- 帖子 #49 ---
There are an infinite amount of systems one can create to trade swings, a simple ema price cross will be sufficient if one uses price action to take the trade. That still leaves us with many bad trades in between reasonable swings. When is the best time to trade your swing system? How to trade a range bound market? It is easy to put up screen shots of trending perfection, and the fact is anyone can trade these moves. The question is how to pick only the best signals and most profitable swings? Thank you Andrew none the less.

Good Job Andrew ,

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Question..... if current TF (e.g 1h) meets criteria for long, but 4h shows super trend is still red, do i still take the trade? Is there a need to check higher TF?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi Andrew, is there a need to confirm the trend with a higher timeframe? Say, 4 hour with daily before placing the pending order?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you for encouragement and approval!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
To be successful in sideward (flat) movement one should strictly follow the rules of the system. Besides, one should not add in that period, and, of course, apply rigorously clever approach to money management and diversification of capital.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
i like your system do you describ your MM

--- 帖子 #61 ---
In my opinion, one should follow strictly that timeframe one has chosen. If there is a temptation to trade also in another timeframe one should just diversify the capital between two timeframes. But comparing timeframes between each other can lead to losses, especially when there is a trend in one timeframe and a retracement in another one.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Andrew, i took a long trade on USDCHF on 30 min TF today. However it went south.. I went in because : - Super trend is green - Non Lag Dot is blue - broke the high of the extrema candle Could you tell me where i went wrong?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
maximteo andrews never says its a 100% win system

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yep that i know free84. just wanna check if i followed the rules correctly

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Great I was going to ask you if you could do that for us to understand more in depth when to place trades. Thanks Andrew Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #66 ---
sorry maxiteo i think yes you do well i if can i would sugest to play in 4 h its more sure i take 2 trade yesterday and 2 win

--- 帖子 #67 ---
maximteo, you entered the wrong candle. your entry would have been the previous candle's high...the one before you entered in. As you could see, there would have been no trade.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It is the first candle of pull back and only enter if the colors stay the same till it enters you. if at any point it changes color before entery, cancel the pending order. this is my understanding after watching videos.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Tha'ts what I thought too, however on post #35 where Andrew talks about the NZDUSD, it wasn't the high of the first pullback candle, it was the last one. Maybe Andrew could clear this silly confusion that i'm having?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I'm getting lost, on few of them he uses first and on the others he is using last. GC,EC,AC are using first and EG,NU are using last. May be it depends on the pair?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Moving the pending order to the next candle for a more profitable entry the market depends on two conditions: a) on the timeframe that is used trading. On the small timeframes (1, 5, 15 minutes) fluctuations of the market are more disordered, therefore moving the pending orders from the market entry point is not recommended on these timeframes. b) on how far the price broke away from the Supertrend line. Take on a note, please. The most favorable period in the market to place pending orders according to the system is when the price goes close to the Supertrend line. But if the price breaks rapidly far away from the Supertrend line, it is better to place tight stop-loss order, because, likewise, the sudden retracement can roll back the price in the opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Andrew I can see that you can get 10 pips easy each tarde on 15 M using your system , with the help of multi piviot ind. I banked anther 41 live pips in the last 45 min durring asia session , I will wait for london for few more NZDJPY 11 Ppis AUDJPY10 AUDUSD10 GBPUSD 10

--- 帖子 #73 ---
In the case of maximteo, it depends on where a stop-loss order was set. If a stop-loss order was set below the nearest price swing, that is under the previous candle (rule 2 of setting stop-loss orders), moving the pending order was undesirable, because the stop-loss order was close enough anyway. But if the stop-loss order was set on a Supertrend line or under the closest extremum of the market, which exceeds the Supertrend line in opposite direction, that is downward in this situation (rules 1,3 of setting stop-loss orders), moving the pending order could be reasonable, as the market broke rapidly quite far away from the Supertrend line and started a sudden retracement afterwards.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Another 10

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Good results! But it should be done carefully because all the levels are of a relative character.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hello Andrew you are making good.And one more request,as you are posting the video for diff currency pair,first make a video on how to decide a trade and make a pending order with a SL by a video.??That will help the newbies here..

Hi Andrerw This is the best system that i used so far , Today was my first 15 Pips loss But I made another +20 right after. If I am a full time trader I will not make less tha 100 pips every day using 15 M charts . Thanks again for sharing your system.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Tazzam, I find interesting the scalping variation of Andrew's method. Could you describe the details of your vatiation? For example: target (I assume 10 pips), stop-loss, R-R, money-management, etc. Thanks, Kostas.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
F.Y.I. I see that the problem has been sidestepped by using the paperclip. Another solution is to simply rename the file.. example you D/L the "Supertrend1" indi... It downloads as "attachment.php" Rename this file to "Supertrend1.mq4" INCLUDING the ".mq4" part!!! Your computer will then recognize it as a valid .mq4 file! This was the workaround I found months ago when this starting showing up from the servers Hope it helps somebody else! Oh... almost forgot why I was here! A STAND UP JOB ANDREW!! KEEP IT UP!!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I take 10 to 20 pips per trade based on A)How far the price from support or restanice , For example If i saw a valid sginal and the current price less that 20 pips from S or R ,I don't enter the trade to get my 10 pips If the price if 50 pips from the next S or R , I get greedy and shoot for 15 to 20 pips See Chart below for a possible trade that i will not take because it so close to weekly pivot. So I trade between pivot points .

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Tazzam Can you post your pivots indicator?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Here is a trade that i just entered for 15 pips because the next R is 65 pips away from the price. My SL if a candle closes under The trend line ,

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Here is the Multi pivot indicator

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Closed this trade -27 pips bar closed under super trend . Wait for the next valid sginal.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Just closed 2 trades @ 15 Pips each on 15 M ALSO as you see that there was a valid trade for a buy on AUDJPY 15 M that i did not take beacuse price was near to the weekly pivot and was a good call .

--- 帖子 #90 ---
See what happen after i got my 15 pips on this trade , Price moved down touch Daily S1 then bounce back up that is why i dont trade near pivots

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Great work taz!! Using pivot points would be a good guideline as well. I just took 17 pips on the 15min

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I took the same trade

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Tazzam, thanks for the quick response. What is your SL usually for the 15-20 pips target? If you are using the supertrend and the distance to the line is more than 15-20 pips (i.e. R:R of 1:1) do you still take the trade or is there a fixed SL that you use? Thanks, Kostas

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Any idea of using this on a D1 chart? The entry would be the same but what are appropriate exits and stop losses? According to the rules, the sl on the other side of supertrend line can be up to 200 pips or more on the D1.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I will take the trade but I will not risk more than 30 pips , I lost 3 trades this week one15 pips another 25.5 pips and the third one was29 pips, Pro traders says that they dont trade Sunday or friday and look like i need to listen to them i lalways lose most of my profit either on sunday or thursday night after 7 Pm EST , So starting next week i will only tarde Monday ,Tuesday and wednesday , Thursday until 4PM EST .

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Great job, tazzam72! Interesting implementation of the system on 15 minutes charts! As I can see it's going to be surely profitable!

Nice system andrew. Check out these two "live" trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thanks! All the glory to Lord and Savior Jesus Christ! Concerning those trades, well, they are quite interesting. And if you are success to get profit following such approaches it's great! By the way, an interesting implementation of my system. In my personal opinion, all the overbought and oversold levels in such indicators like RSI or Stochstick are of general and relative character as well as the levels of the price movements. So, I do not use levels in trading because I consider them quite risky instrument of analysis. And one should trade very carefully when usinf levels. But if it tastes good for you, so, of course, you can use it in trading.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
You can use if you like but I don't like overbought and oversold levels. I think they are not reliable, and they are useless in trends where most part of profit is taken.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
How is your sell order? I hope everything is all right.

[quote=Andrew Forex;3347988] Description of my trading system ″Andrew Forex″ Be carefull, nonlagdot REPAINTS!!!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
[quote=vince;3388053] The indicators I posted here, in the forum, do not repaint . None of them (neither nonlagdot, nor supertrend) repaints, except for the last candle like all other indicators (a moving avarage, RSI, Stochastic, Momentum etc.). If you loaded the indicator Nonlagdot not from this thread, then you should change the "colorback" setting to 0 as DETrader advised. There is no sense to develop a trading system with the repainting indicators.

Andrew: Nice thread and thanks for your videos. I have a request, is it possible to post a video while placing a order with analysis and then a follow up video so that we can see the take profit/Loss analysis? It looks so easy to see a chart with indicators after some time. It always confuses to take the trade when indicators are still shaping up. I have no intention here to question your strategy. In fact, I am asking for this favor as I see your willingness to help others. Thaks, -FX_California

Andrew Very nice indicator mate, well done on sharing. I have successfully traded the London open yesterday on the 5M with this, and a little of the lead-in into the NY open. Thanks, Chngster

Great videos Andrew they're are really in understanding how you analyze the markets . I'm really struggling on determining the right stop loss distance, I've tried an aggressive stop loss of 20 pips, but that is clearly vulnerable to whipsaws specially on the 4 hr charts. Could you post a video on how you determine your stop loss (I know you use the super trend line for your exits as well) for all the various entries and what do you think of a fixed stop loss of around 30 35 pips, have you found that to be too small. Cheers

--- 帖子 #155 ---
30 to 40 pips on a time frame like the 4H is much too small. After the 30m TF your going to want to see SL's going upwards 50 up to 200 pips depending ont he TF. For me ont he 4H it is not uncommon to see 100+ stop losses unless you want to get stopped out very quickly.

Dear friends, thanks for your supportive opinions and approvals! You are welcome! Hi, FX_California! Thank you for the approvement of the system. Well, you should not be confused at that time, while trading I mean. If doubts are cast upon it you should trade on demo account until you examine properly how the system works in practical trading: where to enter the market by placing the pending orders, how to settle and move (if necessary) the stop-loss orders, how to determine the most profitable points to exit depending on the strength and length of the price movement). Also it is highly recommended to choose a good strategy of a money management and follow it strictly (what amount of assets you should invest after positive trades and also negative ones). I am also trying to diversify the assests between different currency pairs and timeframes (mainly 4 hour and 1 hour). These issues are important for a success in trading. Concerning online video broadcast of trading, I think it can be possible in the near future. Now I post videos like previous ones here in the therad mainly to make my system more understandable in practical trading. Besides, it takes much more time to trade and to keep on commenting a market at the same time. But anyway, I think from time to time it would be possible. Thanks! Wish you every success! Yes, to settle the stop-loss order correctly is quite an important issue. Sometimes there is a need to move it closer to the price on the Supertrend line or on the nearest price swing if the price goes in a far break away from the Supertrend line (when there is a big probability of a retracement). One should do it to avoid exessive loss. Nevertheless fixed stop-loss orders can be used especially on those pairs and timeframes you know the best. Of course, I agree with DETrader's words in that issue that a 30-35 points stop-loss could be quite a small one for a 4-hours timeframe and could be hit by a simple market noise on a such timeframe. Personally I prefer to settle a stop-loss order according to the system rules depending on the price movement on a chart.

mr. Andrews Can you please give me a template and indicators here in mq4 downloadable instead of Zip files I cant open your system. thanks. bomi

--- 帖子 #158 ---
See the first post There are no zip files

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I know this fhp files I am unable to open.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
You should not open those files. You should download them and copy the indicators to the folder with indicators and the template to the folder with templates in the general folder where the metatrader is installed. And then you can use those indicators and the template in your metatrader trading platform.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Andrew which time frame have you found to work best.on your videos i see you work on the 4hr i guess the higher the timeframe the better the signals,as i see some of the members working your system on the 15min timeframe. How long have you been using your system to trade live Andrew? Regards

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Nice method and explanation Andrew..I was recieving a few of your free signals a while back and they were pretty good, wondered if you were using this system your displaying now.... I have tried the system itself on normal price charts and gave it a shot on a Renko chart. Things seem to be much more clear since it greatly reduces the "noise" of fluctuating price and leave pure price action. I would to know what the opinion of the guys in here would be about such an application. If you dont know about Renko charts, just search it on this site and thers all the info you need.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Actually, there is no difference what the timeframe is used. The system can be used on any timeframe. But if to trade on the timeframes less than one hour one should observe the market literally around the clock, that is 24 hours a day to catch good trends. And it's a bit inconveniently. One year.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Thanks. Though I prefer japanese candlesticks in the price analysis, but anyway it's the interesting information.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
hi Andrew and everybody, really like this system at all!!! i'm actually trading it on a 15min time frame and of course sometimes it's a little boring like this morning (writing from italy gmt+1) but sometimes it's really amusing! that's why i'm thinking about making an ea modifying a couple of stuff that work better for me...(swingman indy, auto s&amp;r and fibonacci pivot) anyway what i do is: look for 15min entry, if none i switch to 1hr and the to 4hr, in this way you multiply your probability to find an entry! on 15 min i apply the following mm: on 10 pip profit (10 on 4 digit, 100 on 5) stop loss at breakeven + spread, at 13 stop loss at +10 pip (so i lock my ideal 10 pip profit), then i move the stop loss every 10 pip. so: at 13pip sl is 10, at 200 is 150 and so on. But what i run for are my wonderful 10pip per trade applying the formula: lot size= account balance/25000 in this way, i'm averaging from 1 to 3% daily....trading mostly the london session (in a couple of months trading forex will be my only job....no more stock market analysis!!) i round the weekly income trading (when appear) some 4hr entries: i run for 25-30 pips then i lock in and use a trailing stop. Of course i close my trades earlier than yours but using other indicators i can screen the best opportunities (for me) and leave the less floating/dd amount as i can in order to trade other system! good pips to everyone! ps: i'm really waiting for swingman indicators v3 because in v2 i do have some problems of repainting.... do you know how to set them in order to read not the present candle but the previous one?(the same logic we follow when we manually trade it?) thanks!!

I realize i'm a little late to this party, so you can castigate me if these are dumb questions. I am wondering if the Supertrend indicator is the same as the Ninja trader TSSupertend indicator. Since I only program in trade station for backtesting purposes, I am wondering if you could furnish me with the basic algorithm or formula for the Supertrtend and the nonlagdot indicators. I find manual back testing too tedious so i'd like to program the stuff and give it a go with some of my own ideas which i can share with you guys. I was alerted to TSSupertrend on ninja by a friend of mine. But he doesn't know the algorithm for that either. He has been simming for a short time with good results. Thanks for your help, dbl

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi, The flame! Quite an interesting approach to trading rules as well as to money management. As for me, it would be also interesting to get an Expert advisor but with the manual confirmation to enter (to exit) the market or just to open the each trade according to the system rules.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi, oleevier! The orders seem to be placed correctly in your charts. But, at the same time, you should take into consideration the price has already gone quite a long way in the trend till the present moment. So, in such a situation in the market, you should trade carefully and strictly follow the money management rules because of the probable general retracement.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Andrew, Thanks for a great thread. I have been experimenting with the Nonlagdot indicator over the last few weeks so your thread is very timely for me. I was wondering if you or anyone else had a Nonlagdot indicator that had an email function. I would like to get an email sent out during the last minute of the candle so we do not get 100 emails sent out as the candle is forming. Similar to the ASHFX signal indicator that Swingman made. Thanks in advance and I look forward to the growth of this thread.

Dear friends! I am glad to represent you an aggressive version of my trading system Andrew Forex. So… My trading system ″Andrew Forex″ (an aggressive version) Aggressive trading can be much more risky as well as more profitable. It is strongly recommended to master in practice a classical version of my trading system ″Andrew Forex″ before (For those who are spoiling for a fight!) Currency pair: any, but better cross-pairs that give good trends Time frame : any, but usually 4-hour Indicator: Supertrend Entry rules Buy: a) when a Supertrend line is green. A position should be opened by the execution of a pending order. The order is placed on the upper point of the first candle (bar) which is closed above the Supertrend line. b) when a Supertrend line is red*. A position should be opened by the execution of a pending order. The closing price should be going above the Supertend line. The order is placed on the upper point of the market extremum, which is formed after the first rebounce of the market downward (when the closing price is lower than the previous one). That is one should wait untill the price exceeds the point of upper extremum, and only then buy. However, if the price fails to exceed the level of extremum, one should wait. After the formation of a new point of the market extremum, the order should be moved to that point. *Annotation. If the color of the Supertrend line is changed from red to green until the actual entry into the market, the order should be placed on the upper point of the first candle (bar) which is closed after such a change of the Supertrend line color from red to green. Sell: a) when a Supertrend line is red. A position should be opened by the execution of a pending order. The order is placed under the lower point of the first candle (bar) which is closed under the Supertrend line. b) when a Supertrend line is green*. A position should be opened by the execution of a pending order. The closing price should be going under the Supertend line. The order is placed under the lower point of the market extremum, which is formed after the first rebounce of the market upward (when the closing price is higher than the previous one). That is one should wait until the price exceeds the point of the extremum, and only then sell. However, if the price fails to exceed the level of the extremum, one should wait. After the formation of a new point of the market extremum, the order should be moved to that point. *Annotation. If the color of the Supertrend line is changed from green to red until the actual entry into the market, the order should be placed on the lower point of the first candle (bar) which is closed after such a change of the Supertrend line color to red. Market entries without placing pending orders are not recommended. Pending orders for market entries are placed with the regard of the amount of the spread and additional 3-5 pips. Pending orders can be cancelled after the change of the color of the Supertrend line or after placing the pending order in the opposite direction. Exit rules I exit when: 1. The price touches the Supertrend line, or 2. The Supertrend line changes its color, or 2. The price touches the first line of the Fibonacci fan. The Fibonacci fan is constructed from the point of the market extremum at the beginning of its movement and up (or down) to the opposite extreme point of the current market, that is, from the bottom to the top of the movement (when buying) and from the top of the movement to the bottom (when selling). It is important not to confuse: the Fibonacci fan is constructed not from the market entry point, but from the point of the beginning of directional movement or trend (up or down). Fibonacci fan line, which is closest to the price, serves as the exit level. And the exit order should be moved on this line. Stop-loss is set: 1. Under (above) the extreme point of the signal candle (bar), or 2. Under (above) the nearest extremum of the market, which exceeds the Supertrend line in the opposite direction, or 3. On a Supertrend line, or 4. Below the nearest price swing. A stop-loss order is placed with the regard of the amount of the spread and additional 3 pips. The following money management is recommended: either not more than 10% of the capital per trade with the regard of the assets diversification (not more than 1% for one currency pair per one trade), or a progressive system (e.g. Fibonacci or semi-martingale). Martingale is not recommended because it is far too risky in case of the lack of capital after several consecutive losing trades. Adding is possible solely to profitable positions after the each rebounce in the direction of the current trend.

The supertrend repaints. I used 4 hr chart. The first white dot that showed above the green line; that candle closed. Then I placed a pre order at the highest high of that candle. My trade was enetered, But the 4 hr candled immediately went back down and the supertrend line that was green before had turned red for about 5 candles back. It would have been a good system if no repaint

--- 帖子 #173 ---
It doesn't reprint, you should have a wrong supertrend indicator, for me is working more than perfect!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
As I have informed in the previous posts neither Nonlagdot indicator, nor Supertrend indicator repaint except for the current candle as well as all others indicators (i.e. Stochastic, RSI or Moving average). That is if the current candle does not its forming, the indicator could change its color. But when the current candle is closed, so, the indicator fixes the price movement correctly. I strongly advise to use the indicators I have posted in the beginning of this thread.

Hey Andrew, I've been following your system and I must say , it is quite nice in its simplicity. I tweaked it a bit with some James 16 PPZ and some weekly pivot points and and I've been demo testing for a few weeks now. The results do look promising. One question for you though., what is your win % like with this system?? it should be quite good seeing that you place stop entries and if you move your stop with the supertrend line you could be in a trade for several days Best Regards, -Ian

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi, Ian! Thanks! About 5-10% monthly on average by a conservative approach to money management. At the same time I shoud say that it is not a mechanical trading system, but live, analytical one. So, the highest possible level of the profit could be limited only by the skills and the pracrical experience of the trader who implements the system.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Not able to download the indicator in the first post, When trying to download its being saved as attachment.php rather than the indicator itself. Any help would be appreciated.

What is the knowledge behind the supertrend line? sma? ema? CCI 50

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi, 3thPri! It works also perfectly on daily timeframe but waiting clear signals can take much more time. Only retracements can take even a lot more time than two weeks. But profits are higher and more reliable, of course, on daily timeframe in some sense.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi guys! I am not a programmer but, as far as I can see, it is based on CCI 50 applied to the chart with the smoothing functionality in determining the levels of deviation of the price movements.

Dear Andrew, first of all, many many thanks for sharing such a good system. I really enjoyed reading the thread and learnt many things ..appreciate your work and willingness to share in such a nice way. I am a real fan of swingman for his brilliant ideas and esp his dashboard stuff..simply marvellous. I see that he has made ind for your conservative(orginal strategy), just wondering if ind are available for aggressive approach as well. tx again.. ------Learn one new thing a day and never repeat a mistake.

Hello Andrew and all other followers! I noticed the beginnings of your thread and have admired how much time and effort you put into teaching others Andrew! Kudos! I realize that in your strategy you use the Supertrend ON the chart (over price) as a reference of SL levels and such..... When doing some house keeping of indis and EA's I did come across this and thought of you... It is a BAR (history) version of the Supertrend. Just in case somebody has been wondering or wanting! You may not be able to use it... or this might have just made your day! Either way, keep up the great work Andrew!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I always trade with higher timeframe(s) confirmation. So, I find attached version best. It is very comfortable to use because it always shows current + 3 higher TF.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hey GPRFC Do you still trade all the pairs he says. AUD/CAD and EUR/GBP are kind of tough on an hour time frame. Do you use different targets for these pairs or do you use the pairs that trend more Thanks Ed

Hm, I really do not know... It is possible that the MTF indi refers to ordinary Supertrend. Try to put this one into your indicator folder and see what happens. I have tons of different indicators and as I am not a coder myself, I am sometimes not able to say which one refers to another one etc.

Hi Andrew, Great system. I've been looking for something based on Supertrend for a while, but that will avoid fakeouts, and your entry criteria using pending orders below the initial spike certainly makes alot of sense. I have one question in regard to the indicators. 1. Nonlagdot - As i would like to know what the indicators are doing...I'm finding it hard to figure out exactly how it is calculated....have tried googleing...but can't really find out much. Does anyone have any overview on the basis of this indicator? 2. Supertrend. Your version of Supertrend seems slightly different from others i've seen. Mainly, there is no option to change the ATR deviation or lookback period....also, when the trend changes, you don't get the big deviation in the line from green to red - only the colour changes. Again, is there any information about this version of Supertrend? Overall a great system. I've found that I need something at least partially mechanical....systems that are too discretionary get me into trouble! and it's simple! Cheers from oz Seb

--- 帖子 #205 ---
It is based on this indicator except it is showing dots not a solid or dashed line: you can find it in this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=202556

Hi everyone!! Ive joined metatrader platform and have managed to save the nonlagdot &amp; supertrend indicators in the right folders and got them on my platform (thanks seb). Im just struggling to get the settings right on both the indicators so they correspond exactly with andrew forex system, could anyone help regarding how the indicators need to be set up ie to make them non lagging. So when im on my charts and go to insert, indicators, custom, then click on supertrend or nonlagdot there is a box that comes up with different settings for the chosen indictor. Does anyone know what these settings need to be set at to correspond with andrews forex system?!?! Any responses would be greatly appriciated!!! Thanks rich!

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi, I just installed using the defaults, besides nothing to mess with on the Supertrend. On the Nonlagdots: Price: 0 is default = current time frame could also be 15/30/60/240 Length: How long the MA (default is 20, OK for most) Displacement and Deviation also refer to modifying the MA (beyond me) Happy trading

Andrew Where are you my friend? Once again thanks for the great systems i have now used both systems,which are working very well,however i find the aggressive system best for me lets me get into the trades a little earlier,and from my tests with the same risk as the regular system,the power tool here is the super trend line. I am using to other simple indi,s just to confirm entry and exit but once again a good week last week. Regards P.S Keep it simple!

Good to see u again Andrew Could u help us and show some of previous signals that did not work and why u did not take these signals ? How avoid fake signals ? example as shown :

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi, oleevier! In your case the entry order could be placed on the previous rebounce before that rapid and short growth of the price (because the blue dot of the Nonlagdot was on the Supertrend line at that time and the local up trend has been finished its forming). As I said earlier, one should try to place tight stop-loss orders in such market situation when the price goes out rapidly far away from the Supertrend line. Also the proper money management should be taken into consideration in every time of trading. N.B. After a short retracement a USDJPY keeps good profitable trending up still on a 4-hour timeframe.

--- 帖子 #219 ---

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I have been trying to find a good email alert for this system too. I have only come up with this so far. It is an EMA crossover alert with email. The settings for the EMA's are 4 &amp; 8. This ussually hits on the first candle to cross over the Supertrend line. The only issue is that it will send an email before the candle is finished, therefore creating false email signals. It should be moified to only send out 1 email during the last minute of the candle formation. I know that some of Swingmans inicators are created this way so I know it can be done (just not by me). The indi is attached. Thanks for any help modifying the indi. I do not have a desk job so the email function would be great fo on-the-go alerts.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I've got to say I've been using Supertrend for a couple of weeks now and just found this thread and a big Thank You Andrew, that nolagdot indicator and your explanation of a system is going (and has on a couple of trades today that I didn't enter because of Andrew's rules) to help me cut out the already minimal losses I've been experiencing with Supertrend alone. Again thanks Andrew for taking the time to share.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Ty for this niceeasy system, Andrew!

I think any of the following Indicators with email alerts would be a great addition: Nonlagdot - at close of candle with new color dot Supertrend - at close of candle with new color trend line smAandrewSys Signals - Close of candle above or below Supertrend line - new indicator EMA crossover - at close of candle Just a few ideas for programmers with extra time on their hands.

From the author's own words : "I've developed a new SuperTrend indicator. It works the same as the ProRealTime version where you can set the 'Nbr Periods' and 'Multiplier' values. Bear in mind that because of differences between brokers that in places it may change direction earlier or later than the ProRealTime version if you are to compare the two side by side."

The most successful trade for the last week in the forex market according to my trading system rules: GBPJPY, 4-hour timeframe (February 26, 2010)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hello, Andrew! Your system very nice! Thank you for sharing.. I've been testing it for 2 weeks on demo 1h-4h timeframe - the results are good, very good! By the way, what do you think about using an additional indi in your system - standart fractals. Use it only after the 1st entry (1st pending order is opened). Use it just for increase total profit.. Let's see, what we have: 1. Know the trend direction. 2. Have 1st pend order opened. 3. (Maybe) Open additional orders on some price rebounds. 4. Open some additional orders by the standart BW fractals. With fractals we have (if we catch the trend in the beginning) 2-3 (or more) additional trades with good potential (if we guess the trend direction correctly). The sl and exit rules are like your's. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Andrew, what do you say about that? Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Dear Andrew. I liked if are able to give some ide with my trade.I went short on the GBPJPY @ 134.846 hopig for a ride down to 133.810 as first target and then possibly down to 132-131 area. I would appreciate if you can shed some light on the direction of this pair.Also I have been long on GBPNZD for a about 2 weeks and this pair seems to trend down more than up. I am holding on to it as it when it changes direction it charcteristically goes ballistic. Please post me your comments. Thanking You

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi, Noisee! I've not been trading the system with fractals. It looks nice for adding to the current position in trend using the fractals. So, of course, you can use fractals if you feel comfortable in it. Hi, Waheed! The price movements in the forex market are unpredictable at all. And nobody knows what will happen in the future. So, one should use some trading rules to get the expected direction of the price movement. According to my trading system the GBPJPY is in down trend currently on 4-hour chart. Concerning GBPNZD I'll not tell you because I do not trade it. But you can analyse the current situation on GBPNZD yourself using the trading system rules.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks Andrew.You reply is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
It is, of course, up to you how you trade but to my mind you should be careful with setting so many pending orders. The currency pairs are correlated and market is unpredictable, so if you set 10+ positions you have to understand that if you are wrong then you are wrong 10+ times...

Nice trade Andrew. I love how the chart is so clean.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Andrew, Thank you very much for sharing your nice system. I am a novice in forex trading. I liked your system and I tried on demo account for few days and I was successful. Yesterday I started live trading for the first time. What do you mean by "Profit order here. Still in the market"? Does that mean you close the order and make another order.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Exit Rules, page 1, #1.....when price touches trend line

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Post #238 - is this truly SwingMan's latest (v.3) Andrew's Signal indicator? If anyone actually knows. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
It's mean, that the order still open and have good profit. It would be closed by "exit rules". Read first page of the tread. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
By the way, if someone needs.. Indi, that notify (sound alert or signal window or email's you) you then pending order is open (closed or modified). If you trade with many pairs - add this indi on one pair (else the alert doubles). If someone interested in that indy, i could explain, how work or set it. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
i'm just waiting not actual SwingMan's V3

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks for the indi, it will help if you could give a run down on the working of the Indicator. I think it will come in handy.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Just download the indi, copy it in [your terminal]/expert/indicator, open the terminal and drag it to chart. Then pend. order will open - the indi will show notify window.. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi, I put a sell order today with a stop loss on supertrend line. Later on I found that supertrend moved to a higher price when price went up. Should I move the stop loss to new supertrend value or keep the old value?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hi. I don't think, that you must move your SL to highter value. Add attach, if you can.. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi Andrew, I'm a little bit too late to learn your system, but this one is great. Simple for newbie and looks profitable, thanks for sharing. Regards

--- 帖子 #251 ---
hi noisee how to use the indicator FX-EVENTS.mq4 ,can you explain to us? thank you yourspace

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi. Add it to chart - it described in Post #249. If you want, you can customize it in MetaEditor. Just change variables (True or False). Description default settings: Show_Alert=true; //open signal window Play_Sound=false; //then alerts - play sound (do not recommend use it with Show_Alert) SoundFile="news.wav"; //file, that would be played then fx_events alerts (file must be in "sounds" directory) Send_Mail=false; //send e-mail then alerts (e-mail settings must be set up in terminal) MarketOpen=false; //alerts, then order is open (not pend.order!) MarketClose=false; //alerts, then order is closed (closed not by SL or TP) MarketStopLoss=true; //alerts, then order is closed by SL MarketTakeProfit=true; //alerts, then order is closed by TP PendingSet=false; //alerts, then pend. order is set PendingDelete=false; //alerts, then pend. order is deleted PendingOpen=true; //alerts, then pend. order is open MarketModify=false; //alerts, then order is modify (if change SL or TP) PendingModify=false; //alerts, then pend. order is modify (if change SL or TP) Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Guys, based on the description given by Noisee, I have amended the Fx-Events indicator showing all the above inputs. Hopefully, this will help some of you. I'm waiting till market open because testing it. Noisee, please if you feel it inappropriate to post this copy let me know I will remove it.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi! I don't mind about that.. And i attach the source code.. Customize it how you want I hope it helps somebody. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Andrew, Great work with this system, and superb support and walkthroughs. I have some questions regarding the entries. I wonder how you treat the rebounces when entering. Many times waiting for the rebounce can cause missing the bigger part of the trend. How long do you wait for the rebounce, in terms of number of bars? If the rebounce comes in the second bar, most often one can catch a good trend, but waiting a couple of bars often gives an entry in the middle or end of the trend (at least when I have been watching EURUSD for the lasrt couple of months). How much does profit increase when taking trades only after a rebounce, instead of taking it e.g. at the high/low of the first signal bar? I am thinking about taking it after the second bar, regardless of it being rebounce or not, or immediately after the first bar. What is your input? Also, btw, do you always place the new versions of the indis in the first post? Is there currently a newer version of supertrend available? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi again Andrew, I wonder about your approach for stop loss. How do you move it, when using the different choices, according to your first post? If you choose the signal line, do you move it along this line, or do you set some sort of trailing? Do you use a fixed SL, set according to the distanceto from the line in the beginning, or is the SL more dynamic?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Andrew or anyone can help to explain why is my supertrendline is having two colour at the end. One red and one blue (refer to attachment)? Note: i have changed the original green colour supertrend line to blue colour.. Any help will be very much appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hi! Refresh the template, maybe it will helps.. Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
okay SO i have been using some variations of this system but I am extremely thankful I have found these two indicators I really like them! Okay So i was thinking about this system conceptually and it would make more sense if we used a combination of Moving averages to determine our short period or long period. In order to get rid of these false signals. I would prefer a system that gave me less signals but more reliable results i.e higher percentage of wins. have any of you ever thought of using a triple MA indi to determine true times or do you guys think this is too much. This system alone used in conjunction with S&amp;R/pivots can be a powerful tool but every now and then I do get false signals and bla bla. (Yes i know every system gives them) but we wouldn't be good traders if we weren't continually trying to adapt and be better would we? Just some thoughts

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I have found this indicator but there is one of more faults. I am not programer. Perhaps can someone fix them?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi,Could anyone alter swingmans indicator for andrew's aggressive strategy. thanks in advace.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Many people know that investing in the stock market is very important nowadays, but the problem is that they don’t have the knowhow. With the knowledge of the stock market you can end up losing a lot of money. This is where stock trading software comes into picture. It will help you to make profits as long as you know what you want it to do for you and as long as you let it do its job.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hello, Andrew. Like your trading system. I decided to write her an expert. There are already some operating time, but still far from perfected, but becomes quite interesting. If there is a desire to see, write me at pavelg123 dog gmail.com, I will send what you already have. In the automation of your system, there are moments that I would like to discuss. I apologize for my English. If you're going to answer and if not difficult to write to me on the russian.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I also think there may be someone who can write an EA for the Andrew system. if so please do not hesitate to share among ourselves here. every effort is appreciated that poured. keep it up pavelG!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Where is everyone ... Just a quick update about TF. I've been having good returns using 15M TF. Anyone else using similar lower TF.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yeah, I've also been surprised at the lack of activity on this thread, given how simple and effective this strategy is. Maybe it works so well that (well, it works fine for me - I've been using the 4H original rules) there's really little else to talk about!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
i have based my strategy off of Andrew Forex's two indicators but I added a 200 SMA and Trade in the overall 6 month direction. it is AMAZING. It is incredibly easy. super picky tho. only 1-3 trades a week. IF THAT. I have literally gone two weeks with 1 trade. My money Management principles allow me to maximize returns. Its easy. just take a look and customize it to your personality.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Where`s Andrew Forex?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Br_pippin, What pairs are you trading with your variation of this method? Congrats on your success... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I just came across this thread. Br, what time frame are you using, 4H also? You're only taking a trade when both the 200 MA and the 6 month trend are in the direction of the trade?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
What TF are you using? I had some success with system and had a couple of bad trades due to false breakouts.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
How do you avoid false break outs or do your winners out weigh the losers?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
okay let me answer a few I trade the 7 majors with a couple of crosses on the Eur Cad and Eur AUD. yes I take the direction of the 6 month trend and 200 day SMA. (usually always same direction) I mean I also use SandR and its kind of subjective now that I think about it. You know Not very often will you get with with a false breakout if your trading in the direction of the overall trend. thats why it works. if you really wanna know the secrets its just simply stay away from lower TF's and when i say that i mean Nothing lower than a 1 hr TF. I BARELY even look at 1 hr TF's anymore. I use 4hr and dailies. (things get very simple and easy as you go larger TF's)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
sign there waiting... do u see... just wondering V3

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi andrew can you tell me if there is a MTF version of the nonlagdot ? if not who do you think could help me, thanks

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thanks for ur system, it is promising. There is no way the indicators will not repaint bcos they all follow the market. The supertrend, trend magic are just a cci with 50 paramiter, so when the colour change that means the cci is above/below zero.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I would like to know what the nonlag indicator is based on? Meaning how to use it on a platform besides Mt4?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Lokks like you could use a good approximation combo with CCI50 (or simple MACD histogram) and PSAR (0.03, 0.3) in replacement for Supertrend and Nonlagdot respectively for those using other platforms. http://i43.tinypic.com/iwme4j.jpg

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi Andrew Just wanted to say Great job on laying out your method. I appreciate all the videos you have done . Lots of good information in them. Hope to see you posting once again. Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi, friends! Thank you! I’ll try to keep in contact as regularly as possible. I trade without email alert because of probable some false work of such alerts. If it is possible to eliminate those false performance it would be interesting to check them up in trading. Hi, Archie! If you enter the market according to the trading rules of the system, of course, you can miss the very beginning of the price movement but at the same time you enter with lower risk and cut off the fake trends. But, if you want to keep risky trading you can consider and test the aggressive version of my trading system to trade according its rules. ( Post #171 ) I put the stop-loss order according to the system rules. But if you feel more comfortable in putting other kinds of stop-loss orders (e.g. trailing stop-loss order), so, you can do it. Generally speaking, nobody in the market knows when the trend ends. But I prefer the dynamic kind of stop-loss as you said (that is putting the stop-loss orders according to the trading system rules). Lower timeframes can give good profits also but one needs to observe the market 24-hour a day for not to miss the profitable trends. Hi, winterflood! Perhaps, there is. But I have not.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
It is good to see customers all around the globe. It functions on brokers or dealers. It has profit potential from diminishing and raising price. Forex trading as great scope in finical market.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Anybody still trading this system? What a pity that many people are looking for as complicated systems as possible and miss the best strategies that are just working thanks to their simplicity. To my mind this system here is one of the best that is available in FF. I myself do not ever trade any system strictly by initial rules. I just look for ideas and combine them with my own knowledge. But the very basics of my main system have come from this thread. So, hope more people find this place. Thank you, Andrew, and keep up your good work!

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Any system will have a bad draw down period.... in my experience with threads on FF all the time things are going sweet and pips are made a thread survives The moment you get 3 losing days or a bad week people jump ship and look for other strategies Its a real shame because profits have to be looked at long term and not in short term gains. Paulus

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Absolutely! The real result appears only after months of trading, not weeks and certainly not days.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Indrek, That's nice to hear. I wouldn't mind for this thread to get revived. Actually, I was looking at this just before the Dance system, and I would be interested to re-examine. It's just that my trader psycology is more suited for short-term trading but I wouldn't mind developing some abilities for longer term which is what Andrew's system requires. Do you have any tips/hints about how to go about here and what kind of modifications you have applied? Kostas.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Kostas, I have been using this system with a few minor minor tweaks of my own. I like clean simple charts myself. I like shorter timeframes as well and one of the basic things I do is base direction of my trades off of the four hour and enter on the 15. Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Two important tips maybe: 1. I always trade to the direction of higher timeframe. That is why I have two supertrends on my H4 chart - current and D1. I attach the indicator that I use. It has been modified by a user so that it does not repaint. (I have discovered that usual supertrend indicator repaints sometimes.) 2. After having a signal at H4, I usually go to M30 for entry.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks Indrek and Bluesteel. I will try demo trading on these principles. Do you use Andrew's rules for SL and TP? I guess if you fine tune your entries/exits using a smaller TF it could save you some pips (meaning if you are on a H4 and your M30 shows a reversal pattern you could get out earlier before the price touches the supertrend)? Kostas

--- 帖子 #289 ---
No, I do not use supertrend for SL. I prefer to leave more room for my trades. My initial SL is usually 1,5*ATR of H4, and TP is 2*ATR. I set SL to BE at halfway (1 ATR). I do not watch my trades more often than once per 4 hours. I never follow them on M30 timeframe and usually do not close any trades manully. I wait for either SL or TP hit.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
hey guys this is pretty much the system I use. I use 4 hr time frames but very subjective. my MM makes it a LOT different also and a little bit more volatile with more at risk but higher return =D. I prefer to trade in overall direction of charts (I chart on weekly/Daily to determine 6 month direction) then i pick up trades on the 1 hr and 4 hr. I never go under 1 hr. No need, too much stress and too much of my time glued to the screen. I have my phone for that hahaha. I find it to be MUCH more profitable (at least for me ) to focus on the big picture. I think this is incredibly fun and easy and I am bummed I just need capital now (still demo)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Indrek Thanks for sharing MTF Supertrend and how you're using it. I have a couple of questions. Trading in agreement with Daily Supertrend, are you concerned with the color of the Daily Supertrend or just the fact that price is above/below the indicator? Is this a valid entry on chart? Price and H4 Supertrend are above Daily Supertrend but color of Daily Supertrend is red. After getting a signal on H4, if price is above Supertrend and green on 30M chart, do you enter immediately or wait for price to retrace below Supertrend and wait for a fresh signal? You made no mention of the non lag indicator (dots). Is is part of your strategy as well? Are you using 14 period ATR? Thanks Charlie

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I trade a bit differently and always add discretion. So, I cannot comment your trades according to Andrew's system. And also not according to what I use because it always depends on what other pairs are doing. But, of course, it is safer to trade if all your indicators confirm. I just wanted to point out the possibility to trade with higher TF confirmation . I trade MTF whatever system I use. And I do not use ATR(14). I use ATR(120) for my SL and TP. I like longer term averages.

Good to see you dude.We missed u a lot Thanx for coming back.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
yes i also have confusion like mike 1980 that supertrend have tow colour at the end ....... can you please halp us regarded this ......

I am Took first profit at ATR - 59 pips.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
thanks Indrek do u have the last Andrew signal indi. ? I got v1 and doesn't work with IBFX 4 digits

--- 帖子 #299 ---
No, I do not. I find it unnecessary. But I remember that v2 was also posted some time ago.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
thanks anyway , hope the threat stays active . I don't follow USD/CHF but it could be nice if people post the trades they make .

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Short on EU, sell stop placed at 1.234 I use 4 hr charts and we are in a red super trend. But the most important thing to realize is that we are in a 3 month-6month down trend. therefore the odds of a placing a short at this time and it going in our direction are VERY good. This is a high probability trade. Although at the time of this I do not know of any fundamentals that affect this. But I am going for a quick 100 pips. I picked up 100 last night on the Eur/Jpy pair from 112.6 to 111.641. Again they are all 4hr charts and I pick up trades off of rebounds and small retracements IN THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF THE TREND. I have a VERY aggressive money management system so. Usually these trades are placed in full lots or half lots.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I saw the same but since I'm in EY and waiting for AU to brake the '60 trend line I'll have to pass on this one .

GREAT DAY FOR THE SYSTEM , thanks Andrew

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi.. Swingman.. any news for V3 signal indicator ? Activemax

--- 帖子 #309 ---
be careful with rebounds. I already exited my E/Y and E/U orders for 100 pips each. I would recommend staying out of E/U for the moment unless we continue to see another red dot on non lag with confirm from closing of 2 bars and obviously sell super trend. Ive got my eye on A/U and and E/Y this is a good time for this system so take advantage of it.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks for Your advice..

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Will anybody be taking longs even if the daily supertrend still red ?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Andrew, I am perusing your thread very carefully as I already signed up as a student of yours -- thanks for taking the time to share and explain. I have the following questions: 1. You listed 3 possible conditions for Exit. Do you mean by the "Or" between them is that one should adopt one rule and stick to it, or whenever one of them happens one must exit? 2. Would you please share with us some statistics about the performance of this system (hopefully live account). 3. Don't you think that exiting upon "touching" Supertrend line or Fib line makes the trade vulnerable to the inevitable volatility of the market and kills the trade prematurely? i.e., do not you think that we should wait until the candle closes completely above those lines? 4. Do you have any pointers that explain more about how Nonlagdot and Supertrend indicators work? I Googled them a bit but failed to find documentation. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Good morning everybody , any trade today ? I'm waiting for AJ AU to brake the top .

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hello Andrew. First, I greet everybody in the hosue, and I thank Andrew for sharing this wonderful system with us. I learn fast when I see the demos (youtube) you attatched. They really go along way to explain the system. If it will not be too much, can you please do a similar demo (youtube) to explain the aggressive sytem too? Secondly, can you please share the buy/sell indicator you are using? Thanks and GOD bless. Austin.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Austin, Go here to download the indicator - http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=107

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Andrew has put a lot of effort into this and I appreciate that. But could someone explain why they think this strategy would be more successful than just trading a simple moving average crossover and taking only trades with the major trend? I see lots of whiplash losses looking back at charts. I know forward testing on a demo over a long period would tell you. Has anyone been trading this strategy with good results since the thread started in January? thank you

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Can't agree more. I think Guppy's GMMA (beam of moving averages) does the same job if not even better. I see them better because at least everyone still understands what an EMA is and how it behaves. I am not sure what Nonlagdot or even Supertrend is actually, and what is their inter-relationship? I already asked for a sketch of the performance but no one responded. Is Andrew still around?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Nonlagdot is the same as NonlagMA and Supertrend is CCI(50). So, when using these indicators, you in fact use one MA and one CCI. It is matter of taste what systems you use, and other people's results with some system do not matter at all. I personally think that FF is not a place where you can get ready systems that work for everyone. No one would publish a really professional system in a public forum. Remember that trading is business and we all are competitors. But it is a very good place to pick up certain ideas to construct your own system that would be your professional secret.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thanks Psseuro I've downloaded this. I thought the one Andrew is using is different. Thanks once again. Austin

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I love how in forex there seems to be total absence of competence and repetition (and time wasting there from) is the norm. That indicator posted per the link will not work on its own. You need the indicators referenced by iCustom.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
You went wrong because forex is random, yet no one seems to be able to stop themselves from succumbing to living in hope that somewhere in it there is reason logic and sense and they'll find it. And they keep searching.. and losing their money. Get it into your head: FOREX is random and unpredictable! If there were rhyme and reason to it, everyone would make money, which is a contradiction in itself and impossible. The only thing that's predictable about it, is that you will lose your money!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
most complete and utter rubbish I have ever read. The why you think Tahiti you certainly are destined to loose in Forex. I use Andrew Forex but I backup my trades through charts. Here is my GY pair analysis. Attached Image (click to enlarge) does the movement looks Random to you ? to me is looks anything but random. my message to newbies is Learn to read the chart.

Not in hindsight no, it's not random. Why don't you restore the faith of all newbies and post your 3 month trading statement to verify that it is possible to be consistently profitable in forex. Let me guess: 1. you "don't need to" 2. you won't, citing "confidentiality reasons" Just think, one glimpse of a successful 3 month trading statement by newbies will give them all the encouragement they need to persevere. You would be doing them a great favour. You can't possibly deprive them of this can you?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Let me tell you what a great trader taught me once long ago and it echoed what I learned already many times over before in other pursuits. 90-95% of new forex traders fail but it is also true that 90-95% of all sales people fail 90-95% of all new small businesses fail 90-95% of new restaurants fail 90-95% of almost everything there is fails within 5 years. The failure you seek to point out is not in the market, its in you. With sincere hope for your future success I say that only with that intent. It sure took me longer than it should have because I was always looking for the answer to success with it, outside of me. All the best Brian

Hi Thanks to Andrew for sharing his system. I like the look of it- follow the trend, wait for confirmation, and enter on a long-ish timeframe. It would be nice to see some confirmation of whether it works, though, so any info on that would be most appreciated. For my part, I have started the system this morning on a demo account. I will share my account via mt4i: http://www.mt4i.com/users/fokkercharlie For complete transparency! Charlie

--- 帖子 #379 ---
The faith can come through personal trading experience only. Someone's trading statement is not relevant at all. The problem with most of the newbies is that they want to start trading profitably from the first day they find out about forex. Instead, they should spend months or even a year studying before going serious with their trading. By that time they should already have their own trading system that may be put together using the elements of different systems in FF. Trading any system exactly like someone else is not the way to success because no one is posting 110 % working systems in public forums. Look for ideas and pieces of the puzzle but be independent in your decisions!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hello, again. I have a question about a trade I entered with the system this morning - see attached chart. It looks like the trade is valid iaw the system, but I also see that I could have entered the trade 7 candles earlier (before the weekend). So, the question is, should we only take the FIRST valid entry after crossing the supertrend line, or can you do what I have done? Also, what about weekends? I presume that you would advise closing your trades over the weekend with this system, Andrew, and re-open after the weekend assuming that the gap was not too large? Regards Charlie

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I hope nobody missed Indrek's post because you will never read a more meaningful post on any thread in FF or any other trading forum. Forex is like learning to walk... you observe and then you start off crawling, then you take advantage of available support to get upright, then you take some tentative steps on your own. You fall down a lot but eventually you learn about balance and motion and what muscles to use to keep from falling down and get from place to place etc. etc.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
How can you possibly say that someone else's trading statement is not relevant or a source of inspiration and encouragement for new traders? First and foremost it shows that it is possible to be successful. I don't know why there is so much stating of the obvious in this world: obviously no two traders following the same method will achieve the same results. You don't say? Guess what? You will have losing trades! You will also miss great trades because you're eating lunch. Now that really is stating the obvious. Does anyone learn to walk without seeing others do it successfully as well as being shown how? Same for talking. Same for trading! Without hard verification that success can be achieved it's all just hearsay, and yet more of living in hope, which many gullible people seem only to happy to persist in doing.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Andrew, Under white arrow, is it a valid sell entry? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Andrew, Would you explain how you put the Fib Fan on your chart to get your initial take profit point. What points do you use and so forth. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. Trader2010

Hi, I put this indicator on my chart, but it doesn't work. Any parameters to modifiy ?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hi I started testing this system, and uploading to mt4i. Unfortuantely, after 1 week, my circumstances have changed, and I'm not able to keep the test going. The system showed, for the record, a small loss for the week. Good luck, all. Charlie

--- 帖子 #387 ---
How did you arrive at these SL/TP values? I too am trading H4 chart, but use 6 pd. Price Channel (24 hr) H/L as SL and 5 x ATR 1440 (excursion FROM SUPERTREND at time of signal) as TP. I made excursion studies to arrive at these values. EDIT: For the sake of accuracy,I must say that I use a similar, but alternative, indicator in place of Supertrend. Supertrend is shown in chart provided.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
It's futile. I've seen many traders asked to do this, the minute they then show their fantastic results, it's dismissed as fabricated. You also realise that the very best traders, the ones that are really making money that most of us could scarcely dream about, aren't sat around wasting their time on FF. They're making money and enjoying themselves. For as many successful traders there are out there, there also seems as many people like you who want to believe that it can't be done. I only assume you're a bitter Forex loser who cannot accept that others haven't lost their shirt like you have.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I also found my SL and TP values through my personal experience. When trading from h4 chart, I use ATR120 (i.e average range for last 4 weeks).

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Firstly, because I have seen so many false statements in FF. Secondly, the only real motivation that can make you a good trader is your own wish and strive to become better, to learn things, to invent something new. Big money will come to you when you become very good in trading. It is then like additional bonus for being clever, consistent and disciplined.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
to establish parameters. On H4 chart 1440 pds. is about one year look back, ATR for one year.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
One year is too much for making decisions because market can change very much during a year. I use ATR1440 when trading from m5 chart; then it is average range of a week. But on h4, ATR120 is good enough.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
this? You may be right...ATM Eur/Aud ATR 1440 is .0063. One month ago, the same. ATM ATR 120 is .0077. One month ago, .0099. The fluctuations in the shorter average will be greater in amplitude and shorter in duration. Difficult to determine which average is too sensitive, and which, not sensitive enough. Perhaps do away with averages altogether!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
wonder how many ppl still use this system and working for them?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
working with the method in 3 months, good

--- 帖子 #396 ---
no one using this system? no one comment

I Took the indicators and kind of created my own system using them. I also use another indicator and the three of them help me dictate direction of trend then I use VSA for entry and exit... Pretty solid setup

Hi Andrew I have just stumbled across your thread, I am not really intersted in your more aggresive method more your original. On your original statergy what is your general numer of pips you aim for each trade, how many trades per day are you looking for and what is your percentage win ratio? Apologies for all the questions..! Thanks WFX

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Thank you Andrew. Great videos. Cheers

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi, WFX! Pips can differ in number depending on every particular trade. There are periods I have no trades at all for one or even several days. It depends also on the market situation and other factors. About 7-10% monthly by conservative trading if you mean the average profit rate and I understand you correctly. At the same time I should say that it is not a mechanical trading system, but live one. So, the highest possible level of the profit could be limited only by the skills and the practical experience of the trader who implements the system.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Thanks, can you please attached your template with the indicators included? Also do you need to monitor closely your trades, or can you set a pending order with SL and TP and go to bed!! Cheers WFX

--- 帖子 #407 ---
The indiators with a template are in the first post of the thread. As usual, I monitor my trades as often as every four hour, especially during the European and American trading sessions. Of sourse, I trade only by pending orders, and, in very rare cases, I close trades manually.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Welcome back Andrew, let us know you are still in the markets.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
This strategy is so simple. It's very interesting and profitable. Does it exist an alert for this specific version of supertrend indicator (smSuperTrend)? Or does it exitst a version with a sound and/or email alert of this indicator? Thanks a lot P.S. Andrew, do you think that the level of S/R are important? In the post #1 I don't find nothing about. But, for now, I use a S/R sindicator for the daily, weekly and monthly level. Is this necessary? Can you have to pay attention during news announcements? Or this problem is important only at lower timeframe (M15 M30)?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Andrew I would like to ask did you trade usd/cad?? the Usd/CAD market are flat on the 4 hour chart how did you trade the usd/cad by using your system? What i mean is when the Market is flat did you trade? thanks

--- 帖子 #411 ---
This what i mean

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi, leoforex! Good question! Of course, I trade! Nobody knows in what direction the market is going to move in the future. I do not know what happens the next moment: the price is going to break through into the big trend or do not change its sideway direction. Here, one should have the wisdom to act accordingly. First of all, it concerns the money management. You should be certain about how to react upon such situation when you closed your trade by a stop-loss order, or some losses in a row. Should you increase or cut down your invested capital per a trade? Should you close the next trade as soon as you compensate your capital balance or hold on and wait in spite of the possible retracement? During that period of USDCAD sideway movement the price made violent leaps and broke away from a supertrend line for a big distance. So, as I said earlier, one should consider the distance between a supertrend line and price to determine how tight stop-loss orders to set too. Also, you can refer to all the explanations and comments I give through this thread and I hope it will help you to find out how to trade during dramatic times when they come for one or another currency pair you trade.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Andrew thank you for your answer for the USD/CAD that i mention before Now i have another question. I saw the exit rules of the trade and I don't know how to use the Fibonacci fan to exit the trade. Can you show me some example by using picture to show how to exit on the Fibonacci fan?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
hi, leoforex: let me answer you the question. between the red vertical lines are what the image you posted. if you long eur/usd, i don't think there is a singal of out this market. you need to add the stoploss at 1.3763. the charts below: 1st is 1day, 2nd is 4 hour.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Concerning "dramatic times" on USDCAD and the construction of the Fibonacci fan

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I think its very risky to trade usd/cad now, it's not the price-trend or techtical-trend, it's the oil-trend. There is no fibonacci can draw on the chart.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi to everyone, I hope this will be useful for all of us. I have modified the smAndrew_Signals indicator and I add to it a popup alert that appears when the arrows and the prices appears on the screen. If can be useful, I can add an email alert too.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Thanks forexcfa Thanks Andrew for explain to me how to trade on Flat market and using Fib Did you see today Eur/usd? the market is bearish it hit the Supertrend line. Did you exit the trade? or you exit at the trendline that i draw?

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hello Andrew, Please clear these points.. Regards, pip26

--- 帖子 #421 ---
On hitting the Supertrend line. White blocks can be taken as trend continuation entries (to enter the market or to add to the currently opened position). But do not forget, the longer way trend contiues, the more risk it can stop and reverse in the opposite direction. One can move orders to enter the market from more profitable position (on the new highs or lows depending on the direction of the trend), but it can be also more risky for the price noise not to hit it casually. That sell entry point with a blue dot was not ignored because of the big size of the candle and the little probability of casual hitting the order. In other wirds if the price reaches that order the color of the dots surely turns into red again.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
hello leoforex, it is hard to predict the market of eur/usd now, as you can see the chart I post, it is crossing the 200sma in the 1 week chart, I think if you are holding the long order, you should stop to take profit now. Wait for some time, wait for some news to give the dirction of the eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hello Andrew, Thanx for your reply. still have confusion I am asking about reversed candle dot..... breakout candle is having red dot. but reverse is showing blue.... after candle close there is not a chance of previous candle's dot to turn into red.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi Pip26 what Andrew means is when you place the order (entry on the last extreme)...it will not be triggered until the price moves down again...if the price moves down then the dot will have changed to red again. Hope that makes sense Oh and Andrew nice system!! Thanks

--- 帖子 #425 ---
That's all right! I am talking not about the privious candle, but about the next ones, The sell order was placed under the bullish candle with a blue dot. So, if the price could overcome the distance to that sell order and hit it, there was a big probability it kept going down, and all the next dots could become red again. And as the history shows it just so happened!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Thanx a lot men for all replies...

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The eur/usd right now is it still a good time to "Long"?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Andrew, I took the EJ trade at the vertical marked candle low breakout. But CJ i think picked the wrong entry.. can u point out my where i gone wrong for it.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Why are you worried? It may be a good trade.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
well i m not worried about it... but just confused with the behaviour of nonlag dot colour change.... i think according to the rule if dot changes its colour then pending entry shld be cancel... so what about if dot changes its colour for 3-4 candles at or very near of entry point when ur already in trade?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Both EJ and the CJ i think you pick the right trade. But the Behavior of CHF/JPY is not a good currency pair to trade by using Andrew Forex Trading system.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Forget what i ask before. I think I am right by adding a macd on the chart. Just take a look at what happen with eur/usd today

--- 帖子 #433 ---
To place sell orders the dots of the Nonlagdot indicator should be red. And there are not entry points to sell CHFJPY because the dots are blue. As I have informed in the previous posts neither Nonlagdot indicator, nor Supertrend indicator repaint except for the current candle as well as in all others indicators (i.e. Stochastic, RSI or Moving average). When the current candle is closed, so, the indicator fixes the price movement correctly. Also, the indicator's setting ColorBarBack should be 0.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Men EJ has the same manner.... reversel candle also has blue dot... so??? ColorBarBack is 0.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Here is setup for today...

--- 帖子 #436 ---
It is a good entry Pip26 I want to ask why you don't "short" eur/usd rather than short eur/cad?? Also i saw a EA on your chart. could you mind to tell me what money management EA is that?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Another pending order....

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hello leoforex, on my platform Eur/Usd hasnt given me the entry setup yet.. and i m not trading aggressive method. I use this EA for moving my SL and TP on my chart.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
The EUR/USD Supertrend signal is Sell signal before. Therefore, I Short EUR/USD Right now i saw the supertend have both long and short signal together Is this happen all the time???

I think I place the wrong trade. I am too aggressive.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I also think that

--- 帖子 #442 ---
pip26! you break my heart exit the trade I got loss 60pips I also exit eur/cad and loss 70 pips

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Think back on "Short" EUR/USD, I should draw a Trendline to make sure if the trade is right. If you saw the photo on the Last entry short trade, it obviously already break the trendline. Right now the trend on eur/usd is Flat. Should I Long the trade @ 61.8 or Long when it break the trendline? or do nothing?and why?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
not sure if the trend will go back to Bullish again? http://preview.shareapic.net/preview7/023616639.gif EUR/JPY http://preview.shareapic.net/preview7/023616846.gif It's break the trendline. it will wait to entry when the Andrew entry trading system rule appear I really wanna "Long Eur/JPY" but i need to follow Andrew trading rules.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Maybe I just cannot read your charts correctly but to my mind all the setups are totally wrong. Short orders should be under bullish candles and long orders above bearish ones. I attach my GU trade that triggered today.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I dont get your point Indrek... can u clarify it?.. I think i picked the bullish candle for short and bearish candle for long.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Your entries are not clearly seen, so I might be wrong. I marked the signal candle with green arrow. Pending order is above this candle.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Men we have different charts... but on ur chart u took the extremum high, i want to know y did u not pick the second long wicked bearish RED CIRCLED candle after 1st one?? forgot to attach u chart... see please

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Because the system works this way. I have tested moving pending orders to next possible candles but it is too dangerous. The best is to use the extremum as described by Andrew.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
These words are from 1st post of the thread. Where Andrew described the method. Can u clear me this thing. ( That is one should wait untill the price has exceeded the point of extremum, and only then sell. However, if the price fails to exceed the level of the point of extremum, one should wait. After the formation of a new point of the market extremum, the order should be shifted to that point. ) What i m following is... when after making bearish candle in bullish trend look to buy bearish candles high and if price fails to break its high and form another bearish candle then move entry to 2nd bearish candle high. You are right i m also having some aggresive price action and drawdown while taking these type of entries. I am new to follow this method and there is no one who can guide newbies for this method. Even andrew dont visits his thread daily. On chart i marked 2 candles with arrows.According to you and rules, shld i take the short entry at green arrow marked candle not white?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I am just wondering if it is a best time to Long USD/CAD basic on the Andrew Forex Trading system. This is the USD/CAD 4 hour chart http://preview.shareapic.net/preview7/023633632.gif

--- 帖子 #460 ---
How is that? There is no trade at all according to Andrew's system.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Yes, the pending order should be set under the candle with the green arrow that is the extremum point. I prefer to keep the pending order just for next two candles (i.e 8 hours). After that I delete it and wait for a new setup that can occur only after a retracement or reversal.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
why? there is no trade??? the candlestick is above the line and the Line is Green? can you explain why?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Candle is above ST but it is a bullish one! After the ST line turns green, nonlagdot is blue and above the line, you put your pending long order above the first BEARISH candle. In your case, you have to wait for the bearish candle. No trade yet.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Thanks Indrek I think I understand what you mean.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I dont think that any system can get any easier than this. There are bunch of videos explaining how it works. So please stop asking the basics like "Is this a signal" etc. You dont have to read the whole folder, but please at least read the first post... Sorry, I just dont want the thread to die because of this...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
your pending order should have been placed 2 candles before at the H of the short candle. The first extremum was made on the previous candle. In the short candle was the rebounce.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I think some people have already read the first post but they still got question to ask. They may be very new into this market or they may not totally understand or hesitate if the way they use Andrew system is right. That's why we ask question. That's why we have something call "Forums" If a Forums is not letting people to ask question and "Keep your Mouth Shut! don't ask some stupid question", then this is not a forum to build for.

According to my chart, SL should not be hit. The high of the candle was 1.6085. Supertrend line was at 1.6087, so your SL had to be at 1.6087 + 3 pips + spread ...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Andrew, So are you trading the original version or your more recent aggressive version?

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Yes you are correct. I placed the trade and did the stop loss calculation's wrong.. Tired and long day oh and i did the profit to small as well but never had a chance to get it anyway.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Yes, I keep trading the original version mainly (an aggressive version is used as an additional strategy so far).

--- 帖子 #489 ---
and thanks for your contribition to all. Have read the thread, but don't see confirmation anywhere that smAndrewSys Signals gives correct signals according to your method. In your judgement does it give correct signals?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi Pippo, I wonder the same thing. I know Swingman said there was a few bugs with his second version of the entry indi. and he was going to post new one. that was the last post he made on this thread.??? I dont use it personally and look forward to Andrew's input.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
This works fine but when you put up 4 or more charts it puts out a 2010.11.17 20:13:53 Mail: not enough space for 'Andrew System: ' error.. I'm woundering if i chang the "bars back" this would limit the number of email positions from the past comming into the mail que. Once its full thats it. No more emails to phone

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Well I must either have bad luck or I'm doing something wrong. Every trade for me has been a loser thus so far. Could just be market conditions at this time. Will keep testing.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Well I took profit on GBPUSD wayyyy to soon because I've had my physic beat up a bit by loser after loser. I took loss on aud/usd then went into profit then on next trade and closed it to early as well. Overall its a good system but the stops are very big. Still testing.

--- 帖子 #494 ---

Is it possible to add an additional soundfile for Order closed by Stoploss with Profit? if(!OrderExist){ if(LastOrderType[i]==OP_BUY){ if(OrderSelect(LastTicketList[i],SELECT_BY_TICKET)){ if(ND(OrderClosePrice())&gt;=ND(OrderTakeProfit()) &amp;&amp; ND(OrderTakeProfit())!=0){ if(MarketTakeProfit){ //========== BUY TP ========== 17 if(Show_Alert)Alert(LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed by TakeProfit "); if(Play_Sound)PlaySound(SoundFile); if(Send_Mail)SendMail("Order Event",LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed by TakeProfit "); } } else{ if(ND(OrderClosePrice())&lt;=ND(OrderStopLoss()) &amp;&amp; ND(OrderStopLoss())!=0){ if(MarketStopLoss){ //========== BUY SL ========== 18 if(Show_Alert)Alert(LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed by StopLoss "); if(Play_Sound)PlaySound(SoundFile); //&lt;&lt; Maybe here? if(Send_Mail)SendMail("Order Event",LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed by StopLoss "); } } else{ if(MarketClose){ //========== BUY Close ========== 19 if(Show_Alert)Alert(LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed at "+DS(OrderClosePrice())+" "); if(Play_Sound)PlaySound(SoundFile); if(Send_Mail)SendMail("Order Event",LastSymbolList[i]+" "+"BUY "+LastTicketList[i]+" closed at "+DS(OrderClosePrice())+" ($"+DS2(OrderProfit())+")"); } } } }

Yes, it looks interesting... Could you give us indis &amp; tpl?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I've been testing for about 2 wks and I must say I like it. I don't have time to sit in front of screen all night as im in Caliy . Even though SwingMan never did a vs 3... it seems to make good trades. So far I'm doing well. Again demo. I only have trouble taking profit, I take it to soon most of the time. A few times I just trailed stop to super trend line and that has worked about 50% of the time, but that is on the rare occasion I'm home to watch trade on and off. Anyone else just take a hard TP number or what?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Is it possible to turn this into an EA or are there too many variables? Andrew your systems seems very straight forward with little room for error. This seems like it would make a wonderful program. Also, What is the best trimeframe to use with your system? 5min, 15min, 30min, 1hr, 4 hr, 8hr, 1 day??? THanks for your great work and sharing with us.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Andrew, I have a question as to your exit strategy. You say exit when the candle touches the Supertrend line. Does that mean the candle or the wick of the candle. The reason I ask is because if I go by the wick of the candle many of my trades that would be profits would have ended up as losses. Trading where the candle stick touches the Supertrend seems to be more reliable than when just the wick of the candle touches the supertrend line. I would appreciate your input. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Hi, Evaluator! You see, I don't know even if it is possible. I do not use EA and I am not a programmer to make it. But it would be interesting to examine how it works. Besides, indeed, perhaps there can be too many variables to consider them in the EA (especially, concerning MM and diversification of assets between different pairs and timeframes). I would not tell you the best timeframe because it's a matter of a personal choice and trading style, but 4-hour and higher seems to be quite adequate for the system. Where to exit is the important issue that requires much experience and trading skills from all the traders in the forex market I think. In the first my post I described some options to exit including by touching the supertrend line, changing it color or by the first line of Fibonacci fan. But, of course, every trader should accustom the exit strategy according to MM, individual preferences, timeframe (especially it concerns intraday trading on timeframes lower than 4-hours). And it is surely possible to use any additional suitable tools to determine the best point or level to exit.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Andrew, Thank you for your feedback it is most helpful. I have been testing your system for a week now and I must say that I am impressed. I have tried your system in multiple currencies and with multiple timeframes and I have the following to pass on to you and the group. First, this system really works well with the major currency pairs (eurusd, audusd, jpyusd, gbpusd, usdchf, nzdusd, eurgbp, eurchf, eurjpy, gbpjpy, gbpchf). However, with more exotic currency pairs, I have run into many problems. Unfortunately, the margins charged by my broker are high on these exotics pairs like (eurnok, eursek, gbpnok, gbpsek, usdrub, nzdaud, usdnok, usdsek) and these pairs produce alot of whipsaw action that caused many loosing trades. I would NOT recommend using your system on the more exotic currency pairs (eurnok, eursek, gbpnok, gbpsek, usdrub, nzdaud, usdnok, usdsek) because I was unable to produce reliable profits and most were losses because the pairs move whipsaw violently and reach your exit guidelines quickly causing one to incur a loss in most situations. Second, your system tested well in the major currency pairs as I said but only in the higher timeframes. (30min, 1hr, 4hr, and daily) As you move into the lower timeframes these is more chance of whipsaw or market noise (as you call it) that causes your exit critera to be reached resulting in a trade loss. Therefore, I would recommend only using higher time frames. (30min, 1hr, 4hr, and daily) Lastly, as to an EA, if someone could take the indicator ( smAndrewSys Signal v2 with alert created by swingtrader) and turn this into an EA using the Supertrend line as the stop loss I think you would have a winner EA. THis would still require alot of back testing and research to find what conditions and optimaizations would be necessary but based on your principles setforth this could be a very powerful and profitable EA. Again, thank you for investing your time and effort in developing this system. It is great! I have now started to live test it with real money this week and the results look exciting! Best Regards! P.S. Attached are the indicartors and template I am using.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I too am having the best luck on major pairs and on the 4h time frame. I've had mixed results with the "aggressive" vs of this system.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
nice template, but too many indicator, too many parameters. The andrew system is good because is simple and clear. I have been testing it on M5 to have more opportunities. The only problem as in all good strategy is the patience to sit on front of the machine and wait for the signals. I am thinking on turning it as an EA. A lot of work upfront...

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hey dinhero! Thanks for the reply. Yes I tend to over indicate a strategy ; as to the EA I would use the smAndrewSys Signal v2 with alert as the base parameters of the EA. This alert indicator calls on the parameters of the andrewnonlagdot and andrewsupertrend indicators. I know my template is alittle complicated but for me it works. Andrew made an original template that he uses (see the first post on this thread) but I like using 3 level ZZ Semafor indicator to assist in identifying where potential tops and bottoms.(it is not always accurate only 70% of the time) However, it helps to avoid whipsaws and cuts down on loosing trades. Good luck with building the EA. I can not wait to see it and test it. Best Regards,

--- 帖子 #508 ---
an ea would be good for long term charts.. not as much whip But using the email function has helped allot, I can't sit all day long in front of puter.. have a job still lol

Hello, can you write an indicator for the alarm, the trend line changes from red and blue ?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
lufulin See my post number 505. It has the alarm indicator for changed in Supertrend. It is called smAndrewSys Signals_v2_with_alert.ex4

--- 帖子 #513 ---
and thank you very very much or that. I get emails in the middle of the night (london session) and I love it. With out that mod I could not use this system. I would give you 10 vouchs if I could. LOL

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Andrew Are you still out there trading your system, any chance of posting some charts with potential trades? Or of course others who are trading this system....... Thanks

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I am here. I am trading.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Just got long signal for eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Yep but she's not gone back up yet.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Do the indicators only repaint over the course of the candle? Or over a few candles?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I see no repaint. the eurgbp not doing well -34 pips but the eurusd is up so far 2491pips

--- 帖子 #520 ---
If you use these indicators from post 505 you should not have any repainting problems. These are the latest and updated indicators from this thread. They are: 3_Level_ZZ_Semafor.mq4 (8.2 KB, 114 views) andrewnonlagdot.mq4 (4.7 KB, 125 views) andrewSupertrend1.mq4 (3.5 KB, 123 views) smAndrewSys Signals_v2_with_alert.ex4 (8.1 KB, 223 views) EJ_CandleTime.mq4 (1.7 KB, 103 views) http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/attach/tpl.gif andrewforextemplate.tpl (7.9 KB, 130 views) Good Luck in trading.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
the last two weeks have been bad for this system. Lost some of the gains i've made. Still testing

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Have you tested 2009? That would be a real challenge. Very choppy on H4 chart. If method does not blow up in 09' ,IMHO, bodes well for future trading.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
STILL IN USE

--- 帖子 #524 ---
how far? is the still system still performing

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I've been trading it live on the 4 Hour and daily Eur/Usd for months...System works great just as Andrew described it on the first post!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
so here is Aud/chf 4hour are we just wating for red dot below red line here and short it than

--- 帖子 #527 ---
isnt this too far too fast? or would you buy this one?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
l;ike you could get short on first red dot below red line and first green dot on green line and get in and out quickly with 20-40 pips

--- 帖子 #529 ---
wait for swing man signals

--- 帖子 #530 ---
tommbstone, I am trading with Andrew's system for some time, strictly visual which is time consuming. Could you please explain how you set up the email alert? I cannot find an email setting in the smAndrewSys Signals_v2_with_alert.ex4 I am not a programmer but I have other alert indies and they show a false/true option for the email alert line. Your help is very much appreciated Shaishen

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hello Andrew, Just wanted to say thank you for this simple and profitable system. I joined this forum only because to be part of this thread. Hope to be part of this. Is there any way I can get the updates on your posts as and when you publish them. Thanks again. Regards Manju

--- 帖子 #532 ---
My computer is getting updated. i'm old lap top for a bit. so i don't remember but the email t/f setting I belive is in that program. Just need to set up MT4 email which by the way I lost my settings. Grrr let me know if you can't find it.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I would normally be in these trades right now, but it's been a hectic week and I just missed them!! This is a great system, i'm always surprised that it never took off...

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Datrader, I think its never taken off because for one its a 4h time frame. And If your not using the text emails you miss the trades. So its very boring trading. Another reason is you will get smashed in sideways markets. I was ups 1000's of pips then got most smashed everytime we get sideways action. I had to put this system on hold because my gmx email is no longer working with mt4. GRrrrr stupid gmx.com:587 always fails now

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi Guys, this question is for those that are still using this system. How do you set your take profit if you want open a trade without necessarily watching it. I mean open the position and shut down the system for other engagements. Andrew system actually showed how to set the stop loss at the point of opening a trade but not what the take profit should be I will appreciate if Andrew or any other person can shed more light on this. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
set profit to what ever you want or trail it back a few hundred pips. Since its a 4h chart I just move my stop manually everyday till its hit once its at break even.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I'm new to this thread, been trading for a couple of years. For the last few months I've been involved in a system on a different thread. That thread is a very good thread with everyone helping each other. Saw this one while browsing around the Forum. I know this system is different, but I'm hoping it's got a similar character. LOL, I didn't check it out before this because I assumed, incorrectly, that it had to do with Andrew's Pitchfork, which I'm not real crazy about. Anyway, to Andrew, I've read most of the posts on this thread and I would like to say thank you for all your hard work, the YouTube videos are an especially nice touch, and for sharing something you believe in. I'm going to give your original system on page one a go. I love simplicity. The fewer the indicators, the better. What I'm going to do with Swingman's Alert (and thank you for that too Swingman) is put it on the charts. If I like the signal I'll take it. If I don't I'll ignore it. If I'm going to be home, I'll trade the smaller TF's. If I'm busy working, I'll check out the Daily charts. I don't have any questions for you Andrew. Thanks again for sharing. The rest is up to me.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Thanks for the reply. One more thing, is it advisable to trade many cross pairs or just focusing on one or two. While I was demo trading the system, I discovered some pairs will make profit while others will swallow the profits already made.

Hi Andrew! Can you share your trades and results for the last 12 months on google? Thanks Slovforex

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi, DaTrader! Thanks! Hope the big profits will continue in the future! Hi, Slovforex! Yes, I can. But I trade through different brokers, on various instruments and with some breaks, you see. So, it can take some time and efforts to collect all the information on the trading statistics. Concerning results they are profitable.

Closed all positions. I'm tired and have to get up early for work. Total 219 pips. All trades tonight were on H1 TF. Happy trading. Good night.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
How did you get an entry in EUR/USD at 1.4377? Do you wait for the bar to close or enter on a stop? How do you exit? What is your SL? I am using ST to trade the ES on 60 min charts. TP is 40 ticks SL is 10 I also use it to define the trend and then enter on pullbacks to 20 EMA

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Sorry, that should have been 1.4477. I always use buy/sell stop orders, never market or limit orders. To go go short I'm trying my best to follow the original entry rules that Andrew gave on page 1 of this thread, and wait for a red dot below a red ST line and enter on the low of nearest pullback, usually a bull candle. I'll exit when the ST line changes color, the price hits the ST line (which is slightly unprofitable) or PA tells me I've overstayed my welcome and the ST line color be damned. But I will close all open trades at the end of the trading day on my platform (GMT+9), or I can't keep my eyes open any longer, whichever comes first. (I get up at 4:30 a.m. every morning for my regular job.) I use the ST line for a SL point unless it is too close to entry. If PA indicates that a sudden spike could stop me out from entry, I'll use S/R points for SL. IMHO, for H1 TF, there should at least 20-50 pips for a SL. jpy, chf, aud, and nzd pairs have been relatively quiet lately. But eur crosses have had some pretty big daily ranges lately. I sometimes trade the D1. There, I use SL of 50-100 pips. If I have the time to watch the PA, and it becomes obvious that it's going against me, I'll get out earlier, and look for a different pair to trade. I have been looking at a kind of hybrid trading system of trading using some of Andrew's ideas and some ideas from another FF thread. (I'm still not sold on the ST line.) It has shown some good results. But out of respect for this thread and Andrew's hard work I won't discuss it here. I've learned a lot about trading from a lot of traders at FF, for which I'm immensely grateful. But, my main goal is always to keep things as simple as possible. It's OK to have indicators to point to events on charts and/or help confirm an opinion. But, for me, Price Action always trumps indicator.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
hi andrew, glad you are back!, just curious but do you have any other system too or do you stick to this one alone? karan

--- 帖子 #556 ---
iv been searching quite awhile for a longer term trading system that works, glad to see you back on the forum Andrew. performance results or not if your still trading the system after this long that's answer enough imo look forward to learning from this thread.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Not much response lately. I guess everyone is successfully trading this system. I am still learning it but am impressed so far. Thanks Andrew.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Andrew what awesome system why there are so few respond on it, one question do u use this system for your living or you have stopped, and u trade all the session london US asaian or u have spacific session to trade... i would for sure give 9 on 10 to this system very simple so easy to learn and makes total logic of this system i 100% agree to this logic... some thing worth learning and put to practice.. is there any other blog or any other place thaat u put your trades, and why u never made a selling of this system so simple u can cash on this system.... 100 thanks to andrew

--- 帖子 #559 ---
shhhhhh!!!! Don't make noise. Did i hear you say few responds on the this thread? That is to tell you people are enjoying the system. I'm not an exception. This system worth million dollars. Can I tell you this? This is a system that I don't have problem with loss, I have problem on how to say I'm ok in terms of taking profit. Andrew God will continue to bless you.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
i dint get u bro... this is some thing mind blowing system, what a way to approach the forex market and kill pips and to be on the odd side. thanks for the respond. i have a question say we have clear up trend on H4 and we get a reversal bar ut say we have serious of reversal bars but the trend is still up, so we take still the first reversal bar or the last one. and say if u came on the charts in morning and u see the there has treding up pair , but we see tht the pair has reversed four to five times and they all have successful trend back up , till how long do we take those reversals bar as entry, there will be one point where we will have a fake break and turn to a loosing trade. thanks

Can you do a screen shot of your question for more clarity. i didn't get u.

hey chemmy i got the answer to my question i went to all the videos again... it was like i looked all the videos all in one day so went to sleep but took videos session by session and makes notes now its fit in my head, i am not going to trade aggressive style i loved the old andrew logic which has so much solid base in what is teach just perfectionist andrew but where is he not seen a post from him from long time..... andrew sir any new updates or any thing plz comment or please mail me on bhavsar.y@gmail.com

from past one week i am trading in demo not getting any great success any tips as of now i am looking at 7 pairs but gettin 50% 50% results is the session i am enteing is wrong i traade from asain to UK to US i stay in INDIA so its good for me to take few hours of ASAIN session full london and again few hours of US how to trade and which session

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Keep trading the 50% That are winning.... Just Joking! I've never traded this on a short time frame, I have traded it on 4 Hour and daily and it works well. Maybe try a higher time frame with less pairs..

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I've been following this system for a while now, and just gave it a go today. I've already got a floating profit of 550pips+ with 10 trades open at the moment. I also have 4 pending orders ready to go. The first post is all you ever need, no wonder why this thread is so quiet! EDIT: Looks like today is a massive and strong down move all over the market, I was just reading another thread where the result was strong selling as well. I guess this system will have it's fast and it's slow days too

--- 帖子 #568 ---
it does not matter the season you trade, the system works. Focus on these pairs for now and see result. they are eur/jpr, eur/usd, gbp/usd &amp; aud/jpy

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Seems to me you are not understanding the first post. Hint: Before you enter, you must let the price retrace back so that it forms a recent low (for sell-stop) or a recent high (for buy-stop) to base your entry from.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
got u guys thnks will try in few pairs......

--- 帖子 #571 ---
I have been to all this thread. I really like the patient and curiosity of you guys and i have been to all the discussion of you guys about this system..which truly is not giving you the potential of the trade. I can modify it in such a way it will give 3:1 risk reward ratio. I will give you guys examples on the same charts posted by andrew... So i hope waiting will be worth to you guys..i will be back soon. Regards. Shaik mohammed.......4m dubai.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Is it similar with the AVERAGE TRUE RANGE TRAILING STOPS published by Sylvain Vervoort in Stocks &amp; Commodities? This system only very profitable in trending market.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Post away. We are waiting to see how it can be improved.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Its a good trending system. When its not in trend it can kill your gains I like the system.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
hi this system is good in smaller time frame it rocks.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Anyone done any back-testing on different time frame as well as currency pair? It seem to be more reliable on the 1hr time frame for aud/usd than the 4hr time frame. Result for me has been mixed so far. Tried a couple of short time frame 15min for NZD/USD and it hit my SL. Now sticking to higher time frame of 1hr and 4hr.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
My latest 4hr trade on the GBP/AUD currency pair is in the RED. Past experience, i think it is more profitable to take the 20-30 pips offered by the market on the break instead of holding on for longer term. Although the Risk Reward Ratio is not attractive. What is the view of others who has tried the system? So far it is like 80-90% success rate for me if i set TP at 20pips on the break.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi Chemmy, what is the time frame that you are using for those currency pair? Thanks and appreciate your reply.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
honer the stop. When the h4 is trending and your in you make 1000s of pips BUT ranging markets give you a nail biting Draw Down for awhile. I just like the set and forget nature. I move the stop manually. Check the charts every few hours etc easy

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Thank Tommbstone. What is the best time frame for you so far? 4hr? daily? Which currency has been most accurate for you? It is getting near to my SL... hope it wasn't hit it.... For short time frame.. the audjpy seem to work well on 15min for me.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
hi erelation! i think 1 hour time frame is better for this system, because 4h need big stop loses and no often trade. for me most acurate is eurusd.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I used 4hr time frame. i just set take profit and stop loss and short down the computer. I don't have the opportunity of monitoring the trades because of my job. I actually added one indicator from a system which I bought from a guy, although the system is not profitable but I realised that this particular indicator will show me when to place my take profit. So, I decided to use this indicator along with Andrew system and its been wonderful. I don't have the opportunity to be moving my stop loss manually using fibonaci fan according to andrew system. Whenever I'm setting my pending order, I set TP and stop loss. I would have love to do a screen shot of my trading but i don't know know how to do it on this old compaq system I'm using. If anyone can teach me I would be glad. Anyway, from my trading so far on my live account I discovered that Andrew forex system works well on eur/usd (confirmed) eur/jpy, eur/chf and aud/jpy. It is dangerous on gbp/jpy, aud/cad and aud/chf

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Still waiting.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I only used the 4h and yes the SL is larger but the profit is greater. Im just to busy with work to look at smaller TF. Good luck PS the swingman alert that emails/texts is best way to go

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Great work! Thanks Andrew. Looking forward for the metatrader 5 vertion of your system.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
i cannot get andrew sms forex signals to put any arrows on my charts? am i loading wrong?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Andrew's original system does not provide arrows. You can use SwingMan's modified indicators which will signal entries if you wish. Look for them in the attachments section (paperclip, top right). They all begin with sm such as smSupertrend1, etc.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Ive been going through this thread and it looks interesting. Can one of those smart people in here code a sound alert for when the super trend and nonlagdot change color at the end of the candle so we don't have to be glued to the screen (at least we could watch a movie while the trade plays out) God bless you Andrew and everyone contributing to this thread

Dear Аndrew, could you tell me please should I find out is there a flet market or trend, strong trend or weak trend before trading with your strategy? Sorry if this question was already asked, I am newbie in forex. PS: sorry for my english!

Try using this, it seems to work reliably well in the 5 min window. So far I have had a 70% suscess rate. Using the two indicators can help you to identify extremes in trends and make courter trend trades for small pip gains...usially 5 to 25 pips. I just started a new thread to get feedback. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=315572 Check it out and try it with demo dollars. I think you will be satisfied with the results you get.

I downloaded SwingMan's smAndrewSys Signals v2.mq4 from post #107. It shows up in my Navigator folder. But when I attach it to a chart (default settings) nothing happens. Am I supposed to change something in the input section? If anyone could help, I'd appreciate it.

Hi there, I haven't read this thread in detail, but I can answer the question you asked two months ago! An error message will be displayed if you try to load the indicator then click on the "Experts" tab at the bottom of the screen. To get the indicator working, you need to download two additional indicators as well. These indicators are smNonLagDot and smSuperTrend1. Both are available if you click the paperclip icon (196 files) on the right hand side of the screen, and you can find them on the last page, page 4. Once you have found them, just right click to download them. HTH Chris

Hi Andrew Glad to see your recent post. Please explain your entry on EurAud trade. I do not see the original retrace signal. I have searched for a good daily system and keep coming back to your's. If you are willing to share, are still trading this system and have you made any refinements to it. Thank you so much for your efforts &amp; willingness to share gmcc

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Sorry Andrew, ignore the question concerning the entry. It's been a long day. I am interested in any minor changes you may have made in your own trading. Thanks gmcc

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I want to know why no body is posting here in this thread, i think this is very good sistem. Andrew where are you?, are you still trading this profitable sistem?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I guess everybody is making big pips and keeps quiet Seriously, threads with lots of traffic are not necessarily the most productive ones. People tend to try to tweak, twist, improve a system to no end. That is human nature and nothing wrong with it but doesn't mean it will generate better results but often just more confusion Andrew's concept is simple but works. Combine it with the occasional fib and some candle price action, it produces great results. GL

--- 帖子 #605 ---
in my 2 cents... i have observed many great threads are inactive due to a high commitment to keep the threads active by the owners for no financial gains at their own times... it is not an easy task! comments from shaishen is also quite true... an unpleasant factor of human nature... well you will find a simple trading method here... look at the threads ranked "5 stars" good luck!

aud/usd 4 hour is kinda in a channel but dot retraced and is below supertrend

--- 帖子 #607 ---
you can see the 4th arrow to the right was the first one to be a failed "rebounce" as andrew calls it. end of this week or first of next should be good for a short on this currency. Also RSI is starting to dip below 50 and should start hooking DOWN.. Daily timeframe on andrews system takes patience, but the rewards R huge

--- 帖子 #608 ---
first rebounce on friday 4 hour but yellow lines show channel is this a safe short since off of fridays action. on a note Aussie monthly cycles should be down til april

--- 帖子 #609 ---
2nd line kinda shows a "fail" but all 3 others looking good

--- 帖子 #610 ---
hey kara can you tell me the MA you using and the rsi period you using i would like to even know your rule andrew is there any change in the reading of the supertrand indicator thanks

--- 帖子 #611 ---

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi all Please can anyone help me to figure out why the supertrend repaints on the 5 minute chart?

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Yogesheena, if you read all the thread you will find that Andrew have two strategys the first in the 1 post and other a little more risk is the one that you are talking about, he enter when a bar cross the super line trend at the low for short and at the high for long. Take Care. Excuse for my english i´m from Colombia.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi Colin, i think you must be careful whit the 5m TF becouse of the noise, Andrew only take trades in 1H and 4h TF, and the indis does not repaint in that TF.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
if you are a believer of RSi i just look at short shorts when 13 period or 14 below 50 and for longs vica versa

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Thank you kindly for your reply happy trading

I am new user in forex trading. For begging, I am looking for a Low profit (but very very low risk) system for trading. I considered very different system and found that the trend follower systems are suitable for me. But many trend follower indicators are repainting and they confuse me about entry and exit time. Which system is suitable for me?

Andrew, great strategy. Does the Nonlagdot calculation change for other charting systems? For the Marketscope platform Nonlagdots do infact repaint on a 1 minute chart for example. Should I stick with 8HR and Daily charts instead or is a difference in programming translation? Thanks for the ideas!

The next support or resistance according to the daily pivot, news ahead (i get out when news are to be released) i also avoid being in a trade when markets open or closes I would recommend all these things when you are trading M15 Best trading

Hi Andrew Have you traded this system on shorter time frames? If yes, what were the results? awesome system pdt777

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi Andrew, How can i view the videos? Every time i am trying to view the video a message comes up saying it is private. Thanks dave

--- 帖子 #483 ---
You are correct, vids no longer view-able, even on his you tube channel. Guess he retired I still like the system, still use it. If you study his "work sheet" both for aggressive and conservative entries you should be able to run it. GL S

Does anyone know what post or page the latest version of Swingmans indi's are on?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
o Man, this is the bomb, thanks arigatou gosaimasu. This will save me staring time and i think it might save me from premature e, euh closing as well. I suppose it can be adapted to playing different wave files for different events as well with a little twidling. Dont mind if i ever do ? If i do i'll post the twiddled version here.
