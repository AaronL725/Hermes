Hello Everyone, I am pleased to share some knowledge in trading from what I discovered a few years ago this is my first thread here on Forex Factory, I must say thank you to those fine folks for allowing me the privilege here to do just that. THE CHART: Japanese candlesticks,horizontal,vertical lines and possibly zig zag indicator,this will help you identify HH,LH,LH,LL (little or no indicators required) THE SYSTEM: 1. Identify the main trend on a higher timeframe.This would be the Daily/H4 if you need entries on H1,just an example.Looking for a clear trend is essential allowing you to draw trendlines connection points 1,2 &amp; 3. When you establish the above on HTF it's much easier viewing LTF price action.What you don't want on HTF is congestions and too many spikes not allowing a clear run for your trend line (TL). 2. When trend lines are drawn,LTF entries can be taken.What you have to look at when price makes contact at 1/2/3 points are candles breaching the TL and closing within the main trend.Let's say the trend is down,you sell or go short ,you have a TL at a slope from high to low and points 1/2 are connected,price will retrace to another point calling this #3,candle need to breach that area and close inside your structure to become a valid sell. Of course the opposite will apply for buys/longs,screenshots and detailed descriptions will be posted. 3. Buy/Sell on LTF only if HTF framework has been established.There is more to this than meets the eye and that's where the magic unfolds! More to come soon..... 4. Trade Management illustrated in screenshot EURUSD attached.You'll aim for 1:1 risk using SL at previous swing low or ATR if you're fine using that calculation. At 1:1 target close 50% of your position/s and leave to run until 3:1 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

THE SHARP INCREASE IN DELTA CASES WORLDWIDE IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY US jobless claims fell to a pre-pandemic low of 348,000 (previously 377,000), indicating a recovery in the labor market. On the one hand, this is very good for the economy and the dollar index. On the other hand, the labor market recovery can influence the Federal Reserve, so it will begin to reduce the QE program, triggering massive sales in the financial markets. The US stock market ended Thursday's trading without a single dynamic. Index Dow Jones decreased by 0.19%, S&amp;P 500 added 0.13% and NASDAQ added 0.11%. The FOMC minutes indicate that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting the QE program at any time, but analysts tend to think it will happen between September 22, 2021, and January 1, 2022. Investors are likely to be very cautious all this time, so the growth potential of indexes will be limited. European stock indices closed in the red zone yesterday. The British FTSE 100 decreased by 1.5% (a 3 month low), German DAX decreased by 1.25%, French CAC 40 lost 2.4%. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are not going to change their monetary policy at the moment. Given Europe's conservatism, the EU is likely to be the last on the list to tighten monetary policy. The gold situation remains unchanged. Now it is important to know when the Fed will start cutting the QE program. Reducing the Fed's debt purchases will raise US government bond yields, which will lead to a sharp drop in gold. But as long as the monetary policy remains unchanged, gold and silver prices will rise. Oil prices fell to a 3-month minimum. The sharp increase in Delta cases around the world is worsening the outlook for global fuel demand. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) kept the loan prime rate (LPR) unchanged. China aims to build modern socialism in the country. At a meeting on financial and economic issues, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that excessive income should be combated and called on citizens and companies with high incomes to give back more to society for the prosperity of all. Amid the news, Hong Kong's index fell by 2.28% to a low this year, while China's blue chips decreased by 2.4%. In July, Japan's consumer price index fell by 0.3% on a year-on-year basis. It didn’t meet the forecasts of economists, who had expected a 0.5% decline. The core consumer price index, which excludes changes in food and fuel prices, fell by 0.2% on a year-on-year basis, beating economists' expectations. The coronavirus continues to constrain economic activity in most cities across the country. Seven more prefectures are under a state of emergency. Analysts believe the quarantine will hit the already weak household incomes. Japan's Nikkei index decreased by 0.87% to a seven-month low. Quarantine restrictions in Sydney were extended for another month. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

still, some sectors will benefit on the next covid cycle. if current governments won't be replaced then we can expect covid-cycle based economies additional 2-3 years and there will be huge development/investments into various hi-tech solutions to "get out" ... indexes could crash no more than 30%. then govs will stabilize. because pension funds rely on stocks. print additional paper money and stocks price get bounced back on the track we all see mega inflation for construction materials, metals, electronics, electricity, gas etc Attached Image (click to enlarge) thisis May.. now I see in construction materials stores prices are up by 200% on some stuff...

Totally agree on that...gov't replaced lol...smart thinking next covid cycle is coming for sure.They will stabilize anything once it keeps them afloat to remain in the system.Greed,Corruption,Power......CONTROL!

Yes,H4/Daily shows a down trend but a correction happening as we speak,but who knows this retracement might just be a reversal. Zone where bearish and bullish patterns are formed being tested/broken.This is why most of my charts will have those patterns and they play an important role in trading...I don't care looking at indicators,price and patterns give the story.

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech, a long-awaited development that public health officials hope will persuade some people who remain hesitant about the vaccine to get the shot. The vaccine is the first of the pandemic vaccines used in the United States to transition from emergency use status to full licensure, a major victory for a partnership that decided to forgo funding through the government’s Operation Warp Speed program on the belief that the development project could move faster without being part of the government fast-tracking program. The FDA said the vaccine was now approved for use in people ages 16 and up, the only group for which Pfizer now has the required six months of followup safety data. Study of the vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds began later, and the six-month followup is still underway. Until it can be submitted to the FDA and an extension of the license can be issued, the vaccine will continue to be used in 12- to 15-year-olds under the emergency use authorization. Pfizer and BioNTech are still conducting a clinical trial to support the vaccine’s use in children 11 and younger.

JACKSON HOLE SYMPOSIUM SHIFTS TO AN ONLINE FORMAT; DOLLAR INDEX BOUNCES FROM 9-MONTH HIGH Major US stock indices closed Friday in green territory. The S&amp;P 500 index increased by 0.8%, the Dow Jones index increased by 0.65%, and the Nasdaq added 1.2%. NVIDIA, MSFT, and CSCO stock prices made new all-time highs. But that did little to make up for the week's losses. By the end of the week, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 decreased by 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively, and the Nasdaq technology index fell by 0.7%. The main event of the coming week will be the annual symposium of the world’s central banks’ heads in Jackson Hole, where signals concerning the plans of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy are expected. On the one hand, last week, the FOMC minutes showed that the Fed was not planning to cut the QE program until September 22. On the other hand, hedge funds and well-known private investors are reducing the shares of companies in their portfolios, so the probability that Mr. Powell will announce the start of monetary policy tightening still exists. It also became known that the growing number of COVID-19 cases prompted the Federal Reserve to shift its annual symposium in Jackson Hole to an online format. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told senior White House advisers that she supports the reappointment of Jerome Powell as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, whose term expires in February. The White House has not yet commented on this issue, but the Biden administration is inclined to nominate another candidate according to preliminary information. European stock indexes closed in the green zone on Friday. The British FTSE 100 increased by 0.4%, the French CAC 40 gained 0.3%, the German DAX added 0.3%, and the Spanish IBEX 35 added 0.15%. By the end of the week, the FTSE 100 fell by 1.8%, the DAX index decreased by 1.1%, the CAC 40 lost 3.9%, and the IBEX 35 lost 0.9%. Shares of European automakers fell after Volkswagen said it would cut production at its main plant due to a chip shortage. Analysts estimate that the global semiconductor shortage will lead to a 6.3-7.1 million reduction in car output this year, and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will affect the auto industry next year as well. WTI crude oil prices decreased by 2.55% on Friday, while Brent crude lost 2.15%. By the end of last week, WTI decreased by 8.9%, and Brent decreased by 7.7%. The oil market is still under the pressure of the global spread of Delta and, as a consequence, a decrease in demand for fuel. The gold situation remains unchanged. As long as the Fed maintains a soft monetary policy, quotes of precious metals will rise. But any hints on the reduction of the QE program will cause a sharp fall in these instruments. A lot will depend on the economic symposium results in Jackson Hole later this week. The shares of Chinese IT giants are going down as China has passed a new data privacy law that is considered one of the strictest in the world in terms of requirements for companies that collect user data. Another reason is the ongoing trade war between the US and China. Container prices between the US and China have skyrocketed, which will undoubtedly be reflected in higher prices for goods from China. At the same time, the Chinese authorities were able to contain the wave of the Delta strain: no new cases of infection were detected in the country on August 23. As a result, Asian stock indexes slightly increased at the opening on Monday. However, the situation with the epidemic in other Asian countries is only getting worse.

Nice one. Gold +53

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Breath-taking sell ....it came back to your boxed zone,by any chance,did your MACD give bearish divergence at that peak? You're 53 not out,keep the innings strong! Probably you're a good to send as an opening-batsman,then you have to decide which format: test,one day or T20 Speaking of the zone Alan,on HTF swings (like those 1-2-3 points),there is this 5-mins strategy to capture the real deal at turning points,I did a course about that using breakout and bear/bull divergences with the RSI.I think its the best way using an indicator and defying LAG.When prices are closed,there can be no lag/time difference/time-decay,whatever you want to call it,when compared to real time price.I will explain the 5-mins strategy in due time.

US STOCK INDICES CLOSE AT NEW ALL-TIME HIGHS AGAIN Yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs. The Dow Jones index increased by 0.09%, the S&amp;P 500 added 0.15%, and the Nasdaq jumped by 0.52%. Investors are waiting for Friday’s speech by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The July FOMC minutes suggest that the Fed could start cutting QE by the end of the year. However, there is a high probability that Mr. Powell may refrain from talking about cutting QE because of the spread of Delta and the fact that Fed officials aren’t unanimous about this issue. New home sales in the US increased in July after a three-month decline, but housing market dynamics are slowing since the rise in housing prices against the background of a limited proposal displaces new buyers from the market. Major European stock indices were trading flat yesterday despite positive statistics from Germany. Germany’s GDP increased by 1.6% in the second quarter. On an annual basis, Europe's largest economy grew 9.4%, leaving economic activity 3.3% below the pre-crisis level. The European economy is now recovering at a slightly faster pace than the US economy. The German DAX index increased by 0.3%, and the British FTSE 100 added 0.2% yesterday. At the same time, France's CAC 40 decreased by 0.3%, Italy's FTSE MIB decreased by 0.1%, and Spain's IBEX lost 0.2%. Investors are now buying gold, silver, and other commodities as they do not expect Jerome Powell to announce this week that the Fed will cut the QE program. The Fed's soft monetary policy contributes to an upward trend in commodity markets. Oil prices have been rising for the 2nd session in a row. On the one hand, the growth of the quotes is affected by the fact that the US regulatory authorities have fully approved a vaccine against COVID-19. It will reduce the spread of Delta and lead to a resumption of demand for fuel. On the other hand, the epidemiological situation in Asian countries (except China) remains very difficult, which clouds the prospects for a quick demand recovery. China's central bank increased short-term injections into the financial system to calm market worries about the reduction in liquidity. As a result, Chinese companies sharply jumped yesterday. Malaysia's consumer price index, which is responsible for inflation, increased by 2.2% in July compared to a year earlier. The number of cases of COVID-19 infection in Sydney reached the highest record on Wednesday. Officials are calling for more vaccinations to stop the wave of hospitalization. In Japan, the situation with the spread of the Delta strain is worsening. According to the Ministry of Health, the country reported 21,500 new daily cases of COVID-19 and 42 deaths on Tuesday. Eight more prefectures were added to the state of emergency, bringing the total number of prefectures under quarantine to 21. The state of emergency will last until September 12.

Thanks Alan,I have attached the Swing Indicator to post #1,easy connecting the points descending from one time frame to the next.I'm up late today didn't trade much.Any questions just ask.The problem everyone face is coming to the charts late and missing the move,if you do see it later don't chase,be happy you identified the correct move,next time you nail it.When you catch trades open up abnormal risk,well unless you a scalper.

Hello there. New to this thread. I have read it through but I'm a bit confused. I hope you don't mind answering some dumb questions. First off, can you tell me what the square/rectangle boxes are on many of your charts? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I think they are areas of interest where price might reverse from and also a junction with SR lines and/or TL. Drawn manually. go to lower TF when price enters the zone.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks for your thoughts on this. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Is a bit subjective i must admit with regard how we do the lines and boxes but obviously the OP knows how to make money and I am just trying to get into his mindset. The more pictures that he posts the closer we get to doing it right. i can draw lines joining swing points on the chart all day long and it looks a complete mess so be aware that less is more.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hello TBS....sure,never a dumb question,those refer to 1-2-3 patterns, all connected from previous days,where price has created a low,then higher low,breaking market structure buying in case of a failed downtrend on LTF,since we are looking at HTF swings and labelling them.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
XAUUSD Rejection at levels when price made a decision for direction.At HTF we can see the swings from H1 and up creating points 1/2/3,sometimes even whe 1/2 connected price swings rapidly....inside those points on LTF ,this is what can be seen Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks for clarifying. I like what I'm seeing but if I'm totally honest, I still don't quite understand some of the comments in the original posts. Perhaps I could ask more questions about what I'm finding confusing?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Sure,you're welcome to ask......I'll try my best to find straight forward answers,this is why I created the thread,help others and learn too.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I have my gold chart. Top TL is from the H4 and the bottom TL is joining the swing bottoms on the H1. We can see price doesnt like that TL where it is now and keeps rejecting it trying to go up but also a bit stuck there too. I am still puzzling over the LTF charts and how to implement some trades there. But keep posting bossman, we will get there.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
And on the M5 we have what looks like an upward channel making HH and HL heading towards the daily open after the H1 TL rejection. Have opened a long, so lets see what happens

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Nice charts,each time there is a rejection the price is telling us something...are we in for a HL or LH,as with your chart Alan,simply isolate a swing point,add a vertical line where price rejects the TL and the indicator swing point,its H1 TF and wait until the candle close on making a decision,when this happens drop to LTF maybe 30,15,5,1M TF...look for the 1-2-3 rejection at the swing points,maybe its already happening and that is what we see on H1.The idea is to zoom in and get detail entry rather than waiting for hrs .I'll post XAUUSD chat room with some explanations.....time to eat lol

123 BOOM +52. Got scared and closed it before it noticed me and reversed. Little doji there too EDIT:- Looks to be resistance at 1797 from the H1 chart.

This looks like it is going to match in with the other learns I am working with at present. I am happy I woke up in the dark hours this morning to find this tread, great start to my Friday. Have not finished reading all posts yet, however just wanted to check the times you have mentioned being 9pm Tokyo open, 2am London open and 8am being the NY open, would that be a correct judgement?

Thanks for answering and that link you put up, I must have missed something along the way as I did not know that was available or I'm just a little slower than others I just used the same theory on oil with good result so far. they are smaller moves that I worked with, and still proved to work. This is by far my best trading week ever. It is only going to get better from here with your thread.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Great stuff, thank you very much. OK, I'll start with a few general questions if that's OK. Please reference one of your early charts below:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1) Where you have specified "H1 TL", you are referring to the ZZ, not the adjacent horizontal line? 2) Looking at point #2, you use that point as the main reference. So, if a horizontal line (HL) drawn at the lowest body at #2 intersects anywhere with price at #1, we have the initial connection and requirement? 3) Is the point of the HL intersection with#3 to show a break of trend in order to trade with the break of trend? I can't think that #1, #2 and #3 could all connect with the HL and stay on the same side of the higher timeframe trend line. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I'll always answer and thanks for asking,its easy to miss information in real time,it happens with me,I lost the opportunity getting in at the best times for trading,I don't worry,you not slow ,no way...yes Oil is good for smaller time frames getting i and out quickly.....I'm happy to have you...keep safe with the situation all over bro,same to your family.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
1. The ZZ make automatic swing points according to its inputs,thats the indicator.Manually you construct a TL using those points. 2. Point #2 close price at bearish H1 candle.This position on the TL is valid as a connection on price holding the line even with a wick, as long as the body is supported above the line we look for another extension on price.1 &amp; 2 must make some some level to be extended on point 3 in the future.Sometimes it will move away from point #2 and now make 3,as we expect price holding on a tangent. 3. At each point from 1-3....on LTFs will be able to assist in the rejection of price going lower and that is what we are trying to do establish.At point #3 its seems selling will continue within the 1H candle , but never continued and the same candle was a blue bullish one and price never returned as I type right now....turning points and getting in early analysing HTF down to LTF. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for your fantastic explanation! It's starting to make much more sense now. Please kindly refer to the image below. Have I understood the correct location(s) of points #1, #2 and #3 ? The reason I ask is the white line intersects three lows but, the ZZ misses one of the lows so, just to be sure, I thought I'd ask Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Cheers mate and the same to you and your family in this crazy time we live in.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Million Dollar Question We now have #1 followed by THREE (3) #2s At a certain point in time we always think that the preset low is the low we expect the market to paint with prices and candlesticks.This does not happens,for many reasons,I highlighted 3 areas,we take the fist low mark the level after candle on H1 closed and place vertical line,on lower TF we do look for 123 patterns to the left and present price action,if none is available,we wait.Price retraced up and came back down giving us the LH/LL combination and at point,now the 2nd low observe and move the TL to that low as previous low not interested because we're learning to BUY as the very lowest prices with hardly any DD.At 2nd highlighted low candle closed go across to LTF and search for 123 formations.......do the same for the 3rd and which can be said is the final low found in that series.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Looks like the TL are being drawn from candle bodys and not the wicks? That would mean the lower TF candles will break the TL before reversing back thru.

These wicks that spike low do close above as in buys,especially as we're attacking the low level TL formations getting breached we have seen, gets panic into traders and they think selling is going to continue and hold all positions,not looking at the directional movement overall.We can work all day and watch HTF but the second you see swings starting to form,connect the points then go to LTF,a trade might be in the making,this is the edge you want

THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BEGINS IN JACKSON HOLE TODAY The US stock market closed in the green zone yesterday. The financial, industrial, and oil and gas sectors were the growth leaders. The S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.22%, the Dow Jones added 0.11%, and the Nasdaq added 0.15%. At the same time, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indices renewed their price records. The annual meeting of the Federal Reserve will begin in Jackson Hole today. Analysts believe that the Fed may postpone cutting the QE program because of the global rise of Delta cases. Goldman Sachs experts have raised the odds of a stimulus cut announcement in November to 45% from its previous forecast of 25% and lowered the December chance from 55% to 35%. But a lot will depend on whether the cutting happens this year or next. If the program is cut this year, investors can forget about the stock market’s growth until the end of the year. On the other hand, short interest is at its lowest level in 20 years. The same level was before the collapse of tech companies in 2000. So there is still a possibility that the market will go into a deep correction. Everyone is waiting for Jerome Powell’s speech on the results of the symposium on Friday. The US House of Representatives has approved a $3.5 trillion budget program. Democrats plan to spend trillions of dollars on a number of social programs but are having difficulty getting these proposals through Congress because the party does not have a substantial majority. Republicans strongly oppose the plans, citing the high cost and unsustainable financial situation of the country. European stock indices were mostly up yesterday. The British FTSE 100 increased by 0.34%, the French CAC 40 added 0.18%, the Spanish IBEX 35 increased by 0.32%, and the Italian FTSE MIB added 0.12%. Meanwhile, the German DAX lost 0.28%. Germany’s Influential business climate index from the IFO institute has been decreasing for the second month in a row. The reasons for the drop are problems with the supply chain of goods to production and fears of new restrictions due to the increase in Delta cases. Oil prices have added about 10% this week. But now, the situation in the oil market remains uncertain. On the one hand, oil and gasoline inventories are declining (US commercial oil inventories declined by 2.98 million barrels last week; previously published data of the American Petroleum Institute showed a decline of 1.6 million barrels), which increases the supply deficit in the market. On the other hand, demand for fuel is not growing due to the spread of the Delta strain. Stock indices of Asia-Pacific countries are decreasing on Thursday. Investors are waiting for greater clarity regarding regulatory reforms that China holds in relation to technological companies. In turn, the Bank of Korea raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% per year. South Korea has become the first major country in Asia to begin to gradually abandon the stimulative monetary policy. South Korea's Kospi index decreased by 0.5% at the opening session. Japan's Nikkei 225 index didn’t change. China's Shanghai Composite decreased by 0.5%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.3%.

Three #2's ??? - that's really thrown me a "curve ball"! I'm going to have to really think about that I just thought the pattern was three consecutive lows (or highs), labelled 1, 2 and 3, that were evaluated against the higher timeframe trend line. I don't understand - in the context of your last chart, what (reason) makes them consecutive #2 lows? Thanks for your continued patience

--- 帖子 #82 ---
No,we only have 1 white TL,what I mean is during its course in time I had drawn 3 to explain what happens at each point,we are seeing changes in market structure,the lowest low is where we at right now.Price action changes with time,structure will change and so does TL. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Ahhh! I get it now One of the original questions I was going to ask was from your earliest charts where you said "3 is invisible, I don't even know if price will get there". I really didn't understand what you meant by that and now I realise that you were really just enumerating the progression of the market structure! Dohh OK, I'm over that conceptual hurdle so now, I'll re-read the thread armed with that little bit more understanding and see where I get. Thanks so much for taking the time and having the patience to explain to me. Sometimes, I take things so "literally" that I cause myself a ton of unnecessary confusion! As "Arnie" said, "I'll be back"! Cheers.

The greenback ended the day with modest gains against most major rivals. Geopolitical tensions in Afghanistan and comments from US Federal Reserve Robert Kaplan, who said that September would be the time to outline tapering and start it in October, were behind the slump. James Bullard, another member of the central bank, also made comments in the same direction. Comments from Fed officials fueled speculation about some announcement from US Federal Reserve Chief Jerome Powell on Friday , within the Jackson Hole Symposium . Powell will likely refrain from anticipating a shift in monetary policy but instead reserve any announcement to the upcoming Fed September meeting. Market participants, however, maintain high expectations ahead of his speech. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi everyone, If you could take a look at the chart below, I'd like to understand the "Buy" arrow/decision. I've drawn a box around a bullish engulfing. Is that the reason for the buy signal. If so, is that always the trigger for a buy? Thank you very much! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yes I would say the buy signal relates to the engulfing candle. The actual signal comes from the lower TF like M5 and M1 showing an uptrend and rejection of the H1 bottom at 3.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Ahh, I see. Thanks Alan

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi, What are the reasons for all of the thicker trend lines I have arrowed on the chart below. From what I can understand, the 1,2,3 points all fall below the trend line at the very top so, unsure what the other trend lines are for, if anything, and which timeframes they represent. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
They would be TL from other TF like the H4 and D1. I would recommend not having too many TL on the chart as it will get confusing. The OP says Less is more.

--- 帖子 #101 ---

--- 帖子 #105 ---
There be some serious candles going on there. Is is the Fed chair speech?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Yes J.P has a speech at 10am as well as Jackson Hole Symposium. I will reply to all questions soon. https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar

--- 帖子 #107 ---
TODAY, ALL INVESTORS' ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON THE JEROME POWEL'S SPEECH ON THE RESULTS OF THE SYMPOSIUM IN JACKSON HOLE The number of initial jobless claims in the US slightly increased to 353,000 from 349,000 last week. But these figures are still at pre-crisis levels, indicating a stable labor market situation. US GDP year-on-year increased to 6.6% (previous 6.5%), although this is below economists' expectations of 6.7%. The head of the Fed, Jerome Powell, will give a speech today following the symposium in Jackson Hole. This verbal intervention may increase the volatility in the financial markets. If nothing will be mentioned about the reduction of the QE program or if Mr. Powell will indicate that it is too early to speak about it and better labor market numbers are needed, the dollar index will rally down, and stock indices will jump. And vice versa, if Mr. Powell says that the QE program reduction is scheduled to start this year, in this case, the dollar index will jump sharply, while the stock indices will go down. Analysts believe that the central bank will seek to begin reducing monthly bond purchases this year to avoid having to catch up with the market later and risk more aggressive steps to curb inflation. Investors were cautious in the stock markets yesterday, with some investors starting to trim their portfolios, which caused a short-term decline in indices. As a result, the S&amp;P 500 decreased by 0.58%, the Dow Jones lost 0.54%, and the Nasdaq fell by 0.6%. Thursday's US military losses were the first in Afghanistan since February 2020 and represented the deadliest day for US troops in a decade. Some critics blamed Joe Biden for the hasty evacuation that threatened the lives of Americans in Afghanistan providing security at the Kabul airport. Ahead of Mr. Powell's speech, European stock indexes also decreased yesterday. The Stoxx Europe 600 composite index of the region's largest companies lost 0.32%. The British FTSE 100 index decreased by 0.35%, German DAX lost 0.16%, French CAC 40 fell by 0.42%. Spanish IBEX 35 and Italian FTSE MIB fell by 0.94% and 0.76%, respectively. Deutsche Bank shares decreased by 2.3% on news of an inspection of the bank's unit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on information that the bank exaggerated its use of ESG criteria in investing. The EU is considering reintroducing restrictions for US tourists visiting European countries. On the back of this news, stocks of European tourist companies fell yesterday. Oil rising in price and finishing the week with a steady increase. The Chinese authorities were able to contain the wave of delta strain, and analysts at Goldman Sachs and UBS still expect oil prices to rise until the end of 2021, as the supply on the market will be insufficient. Gold added 0.15% yesterday, hitting $1,793.60 per troy ounce. Gold and silver price dynamics are highly dependent on the dynamics of the dollar index and US Treasury bond yields. If the Fed keeps its soft monetary policy, gold prices will continue to rise. On the contrary, if the Fed announces cuts to its QE program this year, gold could see large sales. Retail sales in Australia fell in July due to the spread of the delta strain. The New Zealand dollar slightly decreased after the country's prime minister announced a quarantine in Auckland, the country's largest city, which is likely to remain in place for another two weeks.

You had more opportunities down the road,the fact that BE got hit means your MM system works,congrats most times we are expecting a full run to 2:1,3:1 and it simply may not happen the first time take 1:1 and as price retrace get in as long as lows are still valid,that's the good reason drilling into M1 TF so much chances on the same move down. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #109 ---
You're a Marksman :-) that I like about you,never let a BE or losing trade get you down,re-load and continue the battle,very good On H4 price might just breach the TL with a wick and on H1 broken,this is why H1 and H4 lines show a sign of price not going where we think and can act swiftly on reversals at m1,M5

--- 帖子 #110 ---
The entry could be done on H1 TF as right here visible,or at LTF 123 pattern.there is a reversal morning star there, blue bullish candle failed to close lower than previous candles in the swing.This give us the chance of buying on H1 about a few pips higher than the closed price.The previous swing failed to go lower at #2 and the present H1 candle ,closed above that as well.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Good explanation ,so much reasons to list there on that failed LL.....Yes,LTF give you the live version of price action.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yes,multi-timeframe TL....they help with price exhaustion and rejection at the swing points,if 2 HTF are holding price in the zone,usually its a strong reason the swing might be a good one.Some of those white TL are also H1 adjusted when price action changes,that means if a candle exceeds the tangent of point #1 and #2 connected its corrected when candle is closed,placing TL closest to body/wick.We do this because price remember old levels better than us and TL becomes much more accurate in the future

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Too many not good it becomes confusing and somewhat seems like indicators on a chart instead lol

--- 帖子 #114 ---
This is 1-2-3 pattern we trade on multi-time frames,they are found on all,just getting in early on m1,m5 makes complete sense and allow lower risk and great reward. TL 123 points are just for validation at levels the market allowing us to analyse in real time as the PA defines itself with trend type manner,by definition books say TL must have 3 contact points,but sometimes 1/2 connected and price shoots off,we have a trade and see this very often.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I've attached a chart below - GU H1 with an H4 trendline. I've drawn what I think are the H1 pullbacks against the H4 TL and arrowed where I think you would drop down to the lower TF to look for a 1,2,3 entry. Does this look correct? Thanks! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Swing #3 on that TL was virtually created a long time now,its just price never reacted until 1:00 - 2:00 broker time as the vertical line suggests.

Just reviewing some history on GU H1 charts and looking at engulfing candles from a M5 and M1 perspective. This attached pic is interesting in that it shows an engulfing H1 candle rejecting our H1 TL. Price comes back to retest the zone on numerous occasions and it takes over 8 hours to actually take off long. I am not sure if these small zone retests of 15-20 pips are tradeable for people not constantly chart watching unless we use a break even EA or similar. But the best entry is after the H1 engulfing candle high.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Engulfing candles at various time frames they are powerful levels identified can be a game changer for intraday trading or even long term positions.Rejections at LH retesting LL in uptrend and downtrend usually indicates price is moving in it trend like path.You can trade it on H1 or H4 successfully or scalp LTF rather,since you might have time sitting down at the pc,but not all the time. It such a trend the risk is reduced by placing SL at previous swings,your draw down shall mostly be retracement to HH from LH structure Imagine what those bullish engulfing patterns look like on M1-M5,many opportunities from 10+ pips per day.....

THE US FEDERAL RESERVE'S MONETARY POLICY REMAINS UNCHANGED Jerome Powell’s speech became the main event of the last week following the annual Symposium in Jackson Hole. Mr. Powell said that as long as the labor market remains substantially sluggish and the pandemic continues, tightening the monetary policy could be a premature mistake. In other words, the soft monetary policy remains the same. The Fed Chairman also added that the spread of the Delta strain poses a short-term risk to economic growth and said that the Fed remains optimistic about economic recovery. Nothing was said about the timing of the end of the QE program. Discussions are still ongoing, and this issue will depend on economic and health care risks. However, Powell noted that if inflation remains high, the Fed will undoubtedly take action to reduce price pressures. After it became known that the QE program was not planned to be cut in the nearest future, the main US stock indexes sharply jumped and closed the day at the maximums. At the close of the trading session, the Dow Jones increased by 0.69%, the S&amp;P 500 index increased by 0.88%, and the NASDAQ index jumped by 1.23%. The rally continues. On the other hand, the market indicator of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who compares the stock market valuation with the size of the US economy, reached 205%, which indicates a huge overvaluation of stocks. This indicator has accurately predicted the impending collapse several times. It reached a record high during the dot-com bubble and was also high before the 2008 global financial crisis. And both times it remained below 150%. During the testing of the distance on one charge, Lucid Air's first electric car traveled 445 miles and outperformed its Tesla Model S competitor (405 miles). At the same time, Lucid Air representatives said its Air Dream model can reach 517 miles on a single charge. But the cost of the car from Lucid Air is a little bit higher - $169,000. It looks like Tesla has a serious competitor. European stock indices finished last week in the green zone. At the end of the week, British FTSE 100 added 0.8%, German DAX added 0.2%, French CAC 40 increased by 0.2%, Italian FTSE MIB increased by 0.2%, and Spanish IBEX remained the same. The consumer confidence index in France decreased by 1 point in August compared to the previous month. Germany’s import prices jumped by 15% in July compared to the same month last year and 2.2% in the previous month. European inflation data is expected this week. Oil prices fell and rebounded from a 3-week high amid a powerful hurricane in the Mexican bay. Gasoline prices in the US increased by more than 3% as a power outage shut down the Persian Gulf Coast refineries. Analytical firms still expect oil prices to rise by the end of the year. Gold and silver prices jumped on Friday as the Federal Reserve maintained its soft monetary policy. Until the Federal Reserve announces cutting its QE program, precious metal prices tend to rise . The broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan, MSCI, jumped to a two-week high on Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.46%, Australia's ASX200 added 0.2%, Korea's KOSPI increased by 0.25%, but China's blue-chip index CSI300 lost 0.26%. Japan is exploring the possibility of mixing AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine with vaccines developed by other drugmakers in an effort to speed up vaccine introduction. Japan is struggling with the worst wave of infections caused by the Delta version, and for the first time this month, the number of new daily infections exceeded 25,000. In Japan, 54% of the population is vaccinated with at least one dose, and 43% are fully vaccinated. Japanese prime ministerial candidate Fumio Kishida is calling for a huge stimulus package in the amount of several tens of trillions of yen to maintain the pace of economic recovery.

MAJOR US INDICES CONTINUE TO UPDATE HISTORIC HIGHS The US stock market showed multidirectional dynamics. Technology, healthcare, and consumer cyclical sectors demonstrated growth. The oil and gas and financial sectors declined. At the close of trading, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.43%, while the Nasdaq added 0.9%; both indices updated the price highs. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased by 0.16%, even despite the growth of Apple and Microsoft's shares, which increased yesterday by 3.04% and 1.29%, respectively. The US dollar index is under pressure right now. Excess liquidity in the financial system is driving the dollar index lower and major stock indices higher. And most likely, the situation will not change much before the next Federal Reserve meeting, held on September 22. The only thing that could significantly affect the market before that date is strong labor market data later this week, which could trigger a sharp rise in the dollar index and a decline in the major stock indices. The earnings of more than 75% of major US companies surpassed 2019 levels in Q2. This suggests that many types of businesses have adapted to the new conditions. The majority of European stock indices grew yesterday. The activity was lower than usual due to the bank holiday in the UK. German DAX increased by 0.2%, French CAC 40 and Italian FTSE MIB added 0.1% each. However, the Spanish index IBEX 35 lost 0.6%. Inflation in Germany jumped to a 13-year high of 3.4%. Companies are struggling with supply shortages, which are putting pressure on prices. Other countries in Europe will also report on the level of inflation today. Economists expect consumer prices in Europe to reach 2.7% annually, which is significantly higher than the 2% target of the ECB. Due to the growth of COVID-19, Europe will tighten the rules for US citizens to enter Western European countries. As a result, the capitalization of Deutsche Lufthansa and EasyJet airlines decreased by 1.5% and 0.3%, respectively, the shares of TUI tour operator fell by 1.1%. Oil rose on Monday as US Gulf Coast refineries faced uncertainty over the timing of a restart after Hurricane IDA damaged the region. Natural gas prices in Europe continue to rise. The gas price in the European futures market exceeded $600 per thousand cubic meters for the first time in history. High prices are supported by such factors as low storage levels in Northwest Europe and the uncertainty with the launch of Nord Stream 2. The US Treasury yields are declining. This indicator correlates inversely with gold and silver prices. As long as the Fed maintains a soft monetary policy, the price of precious metals will rise. Industrial metals are also on investors' radars right now. Asia-Pacific stocks have decreased during Tuesday’s morning trading as data shows a slowdown in manufacturing activity in China in August. Japan's Nikkei 225 index decreased by 0.1%, South Korea's Kospi lost 0.15%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and China's CSI300 blue-chip index opened lower by 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. In response to growing concerns about gaming addiction, Chinese regulators reduced the period of time players can spend playing online games. Users under 18 will only be allowed to play games between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. local time and only on specific days. Online gaming companies will be prohibited from providing gaming services to minors in any form outside of those hours.

INFLATION IN THE EUROZONE INCREASED TO A TEN-YEAR HIGH Amid a temporary strengthening of the dollar index, major US stock indices declined yesterday. The Dow Jones index decreased by 0.11%, the S&amp;P 500 index decreased by 0.13%, and the NASDAQ index lost 0.04% at the close of trading. 7 of the 11 sectors closed in the red zone. The technology and energy sectors declined most. But despite that, the S&amp;P 500 index added almost 3% at the end of the month. It is the seventh month of growth in a row. And while the Fed is in no hurry to tighten its monetary policy, the rally is likely to continue. Investors' attention is now focused on labor market data, which will be released later this week. The Federal Reserve relies on employment reports, so very good figures may provoke investors to start selling. Amid the return of millions of employees from remote work to offices, shares of video conferencing service Zoom fell by more than 15% after the company signaled an earlier-than-expected decline in demand. Investors now expect the Q3 report period will not be so profitable as the previous ones. European stock indices also showed negative dynamics on the last day of summer. The British FTSE 100 decreased by 0.4%, German DAX lost 0.3%, French CAC 40 decreased by 0.1%, Italian FTSE MIB and Spanish IBEX 35 decreased by 0.06% and 0.2% respectively. On the other hand, the FTSE 100 index showed its best month since April, while the European Stoxx 600 index grew for the seventh month in a row. The UK energy regulator has established a £450 million fund for innovative projects that will help the country reach its net-zero climate goals. Ryanair plans to transport more passengers this fall than it did in the summer, raising its plan for the next three months after restoring traffic. The inflation rate in Europe increased to 3% year-over-year, which is much higher than the target indicator of the European Central Bank of 2%. The new ECB program implies some deviation from the target, but what kind of deviation is acceptable and what is not is all at the discretion of officials. It took nearly a month for gold to recover from a sharp drop in prices that had occurred at the beginning of August. At the end of the month, the price closed at +0.3%. And as far as the Fed puts off the cutting of the QE program, growth is likely to continue. Aluminum reached its highest level in a decade due to high demand and concerns that China may cut production in an effort to reduce energy consumption and emissions. According to the American Petroleum Institute, oil inventories fell by 4.045 million barrels last week, which was higher than analysts expected. Today, the OPEC+ meeting will be held, and the crude oil reserves data will be released. Volatility in oil prices will jump. Yesterday, Kuwait's oil minister suggested that OPEC+ might decide to postpone plans of increasing production by 400,000 barrels per day. However, most analysts and refiners expect OPEC+ to stick to its plans to increase oil production gradually. China's recovery has slowed. The corporate growth has almost stopped, and the service sector is contracting. It is negatively affecting the dynamics of major Asian indices. Australia's GDP increased by 0.7%, but economists are confident that we will witness more consequences of COVID-19 restrictions.

Piercing pattern,Yes,it breached the zone. If you look at previous swings they failed to go any lower,notice there were engulfing patterns,however this HL didn't create one...we only need data what price did before as historical price action as the swing zz indicator,you can't wait on it for real time,or else you'll be late. After that area where the arrow is pointing,price make HH and retest the zone twice,then making it way up,forming what was the current high of the day.

THE DOLLAR INDEX IS DECLINING AMID WEAK LABOR MARKET DATA FROM ADP September started with renewed buying of tech stocks, which helped the Nasdaq index add 0.33% and close at a new peak yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial index decreased by 0.14%. The S&amp;P 500 index stayed about the same. The national employment report from ADP showed that the US private sector jobs increased by 374,000 in August compared to 326,000 in July, which is much less than the forecast of 613,000. Such statistics have negatively affected the dollar index. Now, investors are waiting for the report on initial jobless claims and non-farm payrolls. If these reports are also lower than the expectations, most likely, the quantitative easing (QE) program will remain unchanged till the end of the year, and the dollar index is heading to a strong decline. Most European stock indices rose yesterday but closed without a single dynamic. The British FTSE 100 increased by 0.4%, French CAC 40 jumped by 1.2%, Italian FTSE MIB added 0.7%, Spanish IBEX 35 jumped by 1.6%. However, the German DAX decreased by 0.1%. In Germany, shares of tire maker Continental (-2%), real estate company Vonovia (-1.5%), and chemical company BASF (-1.4%) declined the most. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said in an interview with Spain's El Confidencial that Eurozone economies are performing better than expected in 2021, and these improvements will be reflected in further economic forecasts. Two major factors affected oil prices yesterday. On the one hand, OPEC+ countries agreed to support the current plan to gradually increase supply by 400,000 bpd, which plays in favor of lower oil prices. On the other hand, the US government report on crude oil reserves showed a larger-than-expected drop in inventories, which would push the price up as oil demand remains at a high level. As a result, the oil price fell during the US session, suggesting that the market is paying more attention to the OPEC+ agreement than to oil inventories. Natural gas continues to set price records. Natural gas inventories reports are expected today. A drop in inventories could lead to even more growth, as the demand is now much higher than supply. Gold prices haven’t changed much compared to the previous day. The fundamental picture for gold is now in favor of growth, as the soft monetary policy from the Federal Reserve leads to lower US Treasury bond yields, and gold has an inverse correlation to this indicator. Asian stock indices are trading without a single dynamic. Asia-Pacific's broadest index outside Japan, the MSCI, decreased by 0.2% from a five-week high. Japan's Nikkei added 0.2%, and South Korea's KOSPI lost 0.9%. Bank of Japan member Goushi Kataoka says that the Bank of Japan is ready to increase stimulus if a new wave of coronavirus affects the economic recovery. Japan should not lag behind other countries in supporting the economy with ultra-soft monetary policy.

INVESTORS' ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON NONFARM PAYROLLS DATA The number of initial jobless claims in the US fell to 340,000, the lowest level since March 2020. Investors are now focusing on nonfarm payrolls data. Economists expect the number of workers to increase by 720,000 a month and the unemployment rate to fall from 5.4% to 5.2%. If the data is above those expectations, the dollar index will rise substantially, and major stock indices will decrease. The US stock market ended Thursday's trading higher due to the strength of the oil and gas, health care, and utilities sectors. The Dow Jones increased by 0.37%, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.28%, and the NASDAQ added 0.14%. European stock indices increased on Wednesday as investors bet that the global economic recovery would continue, even as central banks considered cutting stimulus. The Stoxx Europe 600 composite index of the region's largest companies added 0.3%. The current value is very close to its all-time high. The British FTSE 100 added 0.2%, the German DAX and the French CAC 40 increased by 0.1%, the Italian FTSE MIB added 0.2%. Meanwhile, Spain's IBEX 35 lost 0.1%. Oil prices jumped sharply yesterday. The pressure on prices triggers a sharp decrease in US inventories, the data on which was released on Wednesday. Despite an increase in production by OPEC+ countries, market supply is still far below demand. Optimism about economic recovery and the weakening of the US dollar also contributed to the growth of quotes. The situation with gold has not changed much in recent days. Fundamentally, quotes will rise as long as the Federal Reserve maintains a soft monetary policy. But traders have to be careful, as good labor market data can make the dollar index and government bond yields rise, which in turn will make gold prices fall. Japanese stocks jumped on Friday after officials had said Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga would resign. Japan's TOPIX stock index jumped to a 30-year high, while the Nikkei added 1.87%.

My few trades for the day on GU during my lunch break. I had the zone marked on the M5 and convinced myself that GU was heading down after the zone retouches X 3. Only one short was successful unfortunately. And then NFP arrived and killed 2 of my shorts. I feel progress is being made tho with the TL forecasting of the possible swing points. Just that alone is a big step in trading I believe.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I have buy pressure and sell pressure areas,thats why I focus on swings and many horizontal price lines,this will come with experience when you draw zones well enough to hold price and know when it invalidates such space,you are able to close a loss and recover when price moves within any area at ''X pips'' to recover the drawdown.This has never been thought in any published material I believe,since its a skill to develop naturally.

THE DOLLAR INDEX DECLINES AMID WEAK LABOR MARKET STATISTICS Last week investors' attention was focused on Non-Farm Payrolls data. The labor market statistics were disappointing. The US economy added only 235,000 jobs in August (vs. 733,000 expected). This is a very sharp slowdown in the labor market. The main reason is the increase in the number of Delta cases. However, the data from the previous two months were revised upward, and the unemployment rate decreased to 5.2% (previously 5.4%). On the one hand, such statistics would be negative for the dollar index and positive for the stock market. On the other hand, the market sentiment is now sharply shifting towards further growth of the major US indices. Considering the strongest divergence with the technical indicators, which indicates the strong overbought market, such market conditions will put pressure on the growth of quotes. In other words, the growth of main indices is limited. On Friday, the main American indices failed to strengthen. By the end of the week, the Dow Jones index decreased by 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.6%, and the Nasdaq jumped by 1.6%. It’s a Bank Holiday in the United States and Canada today, so with no important events in the European session, the trading day will be quiet. The leading US infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that officials were likely to get regulatory approval soon to introduce the COVID-19 booster vaccines produced by Pfizer. Moderna is a bit behind in this regard. Last month, the Biden administration announced that it would begin offering boosters to Americans by September 20. A week ago, Israel began offering Pfizer's 3rd vaccine to people older than 12. Officials said the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer declines five months after the vaccination, requiring revaccination. A third dose restores the level of protection. European stock indices also decreased, following the US ones. On Friday, the British FTSE 100 decreased by 0.36%, Germany's DAX 30 decreased by 0.37%, France's CAC 40 lost 1.1%, Italy's FTSE MIB decreased by 0.64%, and Spain's IBEX 35 lost 1.3%. The spread of Delta negatively affects business activity in the Eurozone, slowing the pace of recovery. After last week's poor inflation data, some ECB officials began calling for a reduction in the QE program. The ECB meeting on monetary policy will be held on Wednesday, so traders should not expect a strong increase in major indices until then. At the close of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on Sunday, Israel's main index TA 35 added 0.33%, reaching a new all-time high. The Israeli index often reflects investor behavior after Friday and before the opening of trading in the United States. So it is very likely the major US stock indices will continue to rise on Tuesday. In October, the Saudi state oil company, Saudi Aramco, said that it would cut prices on all oil varieties for buyers from Asia and the Mediterranean countries. Oil prices began to decline at the opening of trading on Monday amid this news. This suggests that Saudi Arabia is assessing the situation on the worsening prospects for global demand because of the new wave of COVID-19 in the world. On the other hand, the number of active oil rigs in the US decreased by 16 units (to 394) last week due to Hurricane Ida, which resulted in a slight decline in production. Chinese Internet giant Alibaba will invest the equivalent of $15.5 billion over five years to the country's "general prosperity." The 100 billion Chinese yuan will be spread over 10 initiatives, including technological innovation, support of economic growth in China's less-developed regions, and support of workers and young entrepreneurs. The investment from Alibaba followed a similar $7.7 billion promise from Tencent. Both companies have previously been the focus of Chinese regulators. Many economists believe that this is a deal with the government to reduce the pressure.

VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS DECREASED AHEAD OF CENTRAL BANK MEETINGS IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND EUROPE US stock exchanges were closed on Monday due to the banking holiday. European stock markets ended with strong gains yesterday. European technology stocks reached a 20-year high and the Stoxx 600, the main European index, increased by 0.7%. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.7%, France's CAC 40 increased by 0.8% and Germany's DAX jumped by 1%. Italy's FTSE MIB added 0.8%, Spain's IBEX 35 increased by 0.2%. Rail traffic in Germany has been limited for the fifth day because of a train drivers’ strike: Deutsche Bahn was able to provide only 30% of its long-distance and 40% of its regional trains on Monday. This is the third strike this year, and the parties cannot find a compromise. At the same time, the volume of new orders from German industrial enterprises increased by 3.4% in July compared to the previous month and was the highest since the data began to be tracked. The famous airline Ryanair has abandoned its plans to buy Boeing 737 Max 10 planes. The reason is the too high price of the airliners. Ryanair is now considering options with the purchase of competitive aircraft from Airbus. Gold prices are slowly but surely rising. From a fundamental point of view, the soft monetary policy contributes to the growth of precious metal prices. Therefore, gold and silver prices tend to rise before the announcement of the "tapering" (QE program cutting). The price of aluminum jumped to a maximum of more than 10 years against the background of the state coup in Guinea, which put under threat the supply of the metal from that country. Oil prices fluctuated around $70 per barrel of the WTI brand. The situation in the oil market remains uncertain. On the one hand, oil prices are affected by a slowdown in demand in Asia and the US, amid a growing number of Delta cases. On the other hand, global demand for oil is still significantly higher than the supply, which should contribute to the growth of prices. China's trade surplus surged to $58.34 billion, the highest since January. Exports increased by 25.6% compared to the previous year, and growth in July was 19.3%. Imports increased by 33.1% year-over-year and exceeded analysts' expectations, who had expected negative data because of port closures due to COVID-19. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept interest rates at record lows and left monetary policy unchanged. Previously, Australia had intended to begin cutting stimulus from September this year, but the economic recovery was interrupted by the Delta outbreak and restrictions imposed across the country. The country's GDP is expected to fall substantially in September and the unemployment rate is expected to rise in the coming months.

Anyone checking the trading system and unclear how to get a good entry or even analysis,ask questions,I'm here most times,if you have been trading with indicators mostly this might become a bit strange as there are no oscillators or moving averages to check levels and crosses,I've been through all that,it just gets me in too late. Even some trades here i'm naturally waiting on retracements,then sometimes set pending orders for entry and the one time you move away price decides to make the move

Hi: Since you mentioned it, I am going to ask a really stupid question. I have been trying to understand this system but there are just too many lines and boxes on each chart. Basically, you draw a trend line on higher time frame from point 1 to point 2 and when price comes back to point 3 on that trend line you switch to lower time frame and look for that 1-2-3 pattern you mentioned earlier in the thread. Did I get the gist of it right?

WORLD INDICES ARE DECLINING DUE TO WORRIES ABOUT A SLOWDOWN IN ECONOMIC RECOVERY The US stock market closed in different directions yesterday. Industrials, utilities, and real estate sectors showed negative dynamics. At the close of the stock market, Dow Jones decreased by 0.76%, S&amp;P 500 lost 0.34%, but NASDAQ added 0.07%. Walt Disney Company (+1.85%) was the biggest gainer among the components of the Dow Jones index. Moderna shares jumped by 4.72%. Apple increased to a historic high (+1.55%). In the US, unemployment payments will end soon, which could have a significant impact on economic growth. Also, it should be noted that President Biden plans to raise corporate taxes, which will mean a drop in corporate profits. Many economists are inclined to believe that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting the QE program in November. All this consists in the “perfect storm”, which will eventually lead to a drop in major stock indices. European stock indices closed in the red zone yesterday. The Stoxx Europe 600 composite index of the region's largest companies decreased by 0.5%. The British FTSE 100 lost 0.5%, French CAC 40 decreased by 0.3%, German DAX decreased by 0.6%, Italian FTSE MIB lost 0.7%. The exception was the Spanish IBEX 35, which added 0.1%. Indexes of economic sentiment in European countries are declining, which indicates a slowdown in the economic recovery in the region. The UK government plans to increase the National Insurance Tax to pay for social and health care services. A growing number of business groups and analytical centers oppose this decision since due to labor shortages, such a move threatens to further undermine the prospects for economic recovery. The situation in the oil market remains uncertain. On the one hand, the sharp decrease of Saudi Arabia's selling prices for Asia and some European countries caused fears of a demand slowdown. On the other hand, good economic data from China and production disruptions in the US limit the decline. Analysts' houses are still forecasting a rise in prices to $80 per barrel by the end of the year. Gold prices dropped sharply yesterday amid a rise in the dollar index (+0.55%) and rising US Treasury yields (+1.39%). Gold prices are inversely correlated with these indicators. Pressure on prices is also triggered by concerns about the soonest reduction of the QE program, which will undoubtedly lead to a decline in precious metals prices. China plans to open a new Beijing Stock Exchange. It was announced by the country's leader Xi Jinping. He said that because of the reduction of opportunities for listing on American exchanges, Beijing will refocus on domestic opportunities, which will allow direct investment in promising technological companies. The news boosted shares of Chinese brokerage companies, but shares of companies on competitive exchanges declined. Many investors now fear that competition for the listing companies is inevitable. Revised Japanese GDP growth data boosted the Nikkei index at the opening of trading on Wednesday. Most other indices opened lower. Australia's main index ASX 200 decreased by 0.32%, China's CSI300 blue-chip index decreased by 0.04% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.12%.

THE DOLLAR INDEX HAS STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF GOOD JOB OPENINGS STATISTICS American employers struggle to find workers. As a result, the number of vacancies in the US reached a record high of 10.9 million. The news was positive for the dollar index and negative for the major stock indices. At the close of the stock market, the Dow Jones index decreased by 0.20%, the S&amp;P 500 decreased by 0.13%, and the NASDAQ technology index lost 0.57%. Mostly the negative dynamics were observed in the oil and gas and technology sectors. John Williams, the representative of the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that the labor market needs significant progress to achieve the maximum goal of the Central Bank. However, he added that it might be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to start cutting the QE program later this year if the economy continues to improve. Eventually, it is becoming clear that growth in the US economy is slowing. There are plans to raise corporate taxes and reduce the quantitative easing program. Investors should not expect further stock market gains this year and should focus on closing positions and rebalancing their portfolios. European stock indices also closed in the red zone yesterday. The British FTSE 100 decreased by 0.75%, French CAC 40 lost 0.85%, German DAX dropped 1.5%, Italian FTSE MIB and Spanish IBEX 35 lost 0.75% and 0.6% respectively. All indices finished the day at their lowest levels in the last two to four weeks. Significant declines were also posted by the pharmaceutical stocks, including Novartis (-1.8%), AstraZeneca (-1.8%), and Sanofi (-2.5%). JP Morgan downgraded green energy companies Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy S.A. and Siemens Energy AG. As a result, the companies' shares lost 8.6% and 8.1%, respectively. Today, the European Central Bank will publish its interest rate decision and announce further monetary policy plans. It is more likely that nothing will change, but amid high inflation in Europe, there are talks about possible stimulus cuts. The US Department of Energy slightly lowered its forecast for the price of Brent crude oil for the current year from $68.71 to $68.61 per barrel. OPEC+ crude oil production increase and reduction of global oil demand in response to COVID-19 spread have a negative impact on the growth of quotes. Against the backdrop of a rising dollar index and rising US Treasury bond yields, the price of gold and silver declined yesterday. Given the fact that the QE program is likely to be reduced this year, investors should not expect a significant increase in precious metal prices. Japan is going to extend the state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions until the end of this month to curb the outbreak of the virus and prevent hospital overflow. Major Asian indices are still under pressure from the outbreak of the virus in the region and also because investors fear that major central banks will soon begin to cut the QE program, which will lead to a large correction in the markets. At the end of yesterday's trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 index decreased by 0.38%, Australia's ASX 200 index lost 1.01%, Korea's KOSPI decreased by 0.74%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 1.17%, with tech companies declining the most.

THE DOLLAR INDEX CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN, SENDING MAJOR STOCK INDICES DOWN Last week, investors focused on the release of the ECB's monetary policy plans. The European Central Bank left the interest rate unchanged and slightly raised its inflation target this year. But the ECB will likely start to reduce its stimulus program in the next quarter. Such news had a negative impact on the US market as well. Also, investors are now inclined to believe that the Federal Reserve will follow its colleagues from Europe and start cutting its quantitative easing program next quarter as well. A lot will depend on inflation data released this week in the USA, Canada, Great Britain, Europe, and Japan. The US stock market finished Friday's trading with a decline amid negative dynamics from the utilities, technology, and health care sectors. Dow Jones index lost 0.78% (-2.24% for the week) reaching a monthly minimum, S&amp;P 500 decreased by 0.77% (-1.63% for the week), NASDAQ index lost 0.87% (-1.29% for the week). Apple shares were the biggest fallers among the Dow Jones components, falling by 3.3%. It becomes clear that investors and hedge funds are cutting their positions now. US Democratic senators have proposed imposing a 2% tax on the amount that public companies spend on stock buybacks. Given the Democrats' plans to substantially increase taxes on large corporations, such rhetoric puts negative pressure on major US stock markets. On the other hand, tax benefits for electric vehicles will be expanded. The main European stock indexes closed in the red zone on Friday. The only exception was the British FTSE 100 index, which increased by 0.07%. But by the end of the week, the index lost 1.53%. German DAX lost 1.32% at the end of the week. The correlation between the American and the European indices is clearly seen again. Considering the fact that the ECB plans to start cutting back its stimulus program in the next quarter, traders should not expect significant growth of the main European indices. Oil prices increased to $73 a barrel on Friday, helped by growing signs of a US inventory shortage in the wake of Hurricane Ida and the hopes for a renewal of trade between the US and China, which boosted riskier assets. Two OPEC+ sources said Monday the group would lower its 2022 oil demand growth forecast as the spread of the Delta virus casts doubt on fuel demand growth. Asia-Pacific stock indices opened the trading week lower, following Friday's negative performance by US indices last week. Japan's Nikkei 225 index has already lost 0.3% since the opening session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index decreased by 2.2%, China's Shanghai Composite decreased by 0.2%, South Korea's KOSPI lost 0.5%. In Japan, the PPI index increased by 5.5% in August compared to the same period of the previous year. Shares of Chinese technology companies are falling again amid increasing control by the authorities. Regulators have strongly warned internet platforms not to try to bypass recently introduced restrictive measures.

INVESTORS ARE WAITING FOR INFLATION DATA IN THE US AND EUROPE The US stock indices closed in the green zone yesterday. The Dow Jones added 0.76%, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 0.23%, while the Nasdaq Composite technology index slightly decreased by 0.07%. On the one hand, the market was positively influenced by the investors' expectations that inflation would not accelerate and the Federal Reserve System and the US government would continue to support the economy. On the other hand, Patrick Harker, head of the Philadelphia Fed, also wants the central bank to start cutting stimulus as soon as this year. It also should be noted that statistically, September and October are weak months for the major US indices. The indices tend to drop before winter and then experience a bullish rally for Christmas. European stock indices also closed in the green zone due to an increase in energy companies' shares amid higher electricity and oil prices. The British FTSE 100 index added 0.6%, French CAC 40 increased by 0.2%, German DAX jumped by 0.6%, Italian FTSE MIB added 0.9%, and Spanish IBEX 35 jumped by 1.4%. Commodity prices are rising again. European gas and electricity prices have set new records, while commodity prices are on the verge of exceeding ten-year highs. This threatens faster inflation, higher consumer spending, and pressure on central banks to limit the massive stimulus measures underlying much of the rise in commodity prices. Aluminum and steel prices have also resumed growth. OPEC+ officials see higher demand for oil this year and next. Gold prices are trading around $1800 per troy ounce. Gold has lost some ground over the past 7 days as the dollar index and US Treasury bond yields increased. Traders should not expect the precious metals prices to grow substantially till the end of the year, and gold and silver are likely to lose their prices sharply if the "tapering" is announced. Asian stock indices showed different dynamics yesterday. Australia's ASX200 index decreased by 0.31%, China's CSI300 blue-chip index decreased by 0.2%, but Tokyo's Nikkei 225 added 0.72%. Hong Kong Hang Seng Index and Chinese CSI300 have already lost 1.21% and 1.51%, respectively, since today’s opening. Alibaba Group Holding decreased by 1.6% yesterday. The Chinese authorities intend to split the Alipay payment service, which has more than 1 billion users. Beijing demands to separate Huabei and Jiebe online lending services into an independent business, attract outside shareholders, and create a separate application for these operations. There is a new Delta outbreak in southeastern China. In just four days, 102 cases were reported in three cities in Fujian province with a population of 5 million. This is not much for the density of this region, but local authorities have already taken restrictive measures. The head of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), Philip Lowe, said that restrictions due to the coronavirus would cause a sharp decline in the economy this quarter but expressed confidence that activity would quickly recover after removing restrictions in the next quarter. Also, Philip Lowe confirmed that interest rates would remain low until 2024.

THE MAIN STOCK INDICES ARE REDUCED AHEAD OF THE FED MEETING The US Producer Price Index, which shows the rate of inflation between factories, jumped to 9.6% year-over-year (9.2% was expected), the highest level since 2010. Major US stock indices are reduced ahead of the Fed's decision, while Omicron is again fueling investor worries about the imposition of restrictions in several countries. This will surely lead to a drop in business activity as well as a delayed labor market recovery and supply chain issues pushing up inflation. By market close yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30) decreased by 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 (US500) decreased by 0.75%, and the Nasdaq Composite (US100) lost 1.14%. Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to announce an acceleration of QE program cuts today. This will allow the central bank to begin raising interest rates as early as next spring. Fed officials are expected to release a new forecast showing two or three interest rate hikes in 2022 and three or four more in 2023. American Airlines plans to hire 18,000 people next year as it predicts a recovery in travel. The WHO says that 77 countries have already reported cases of the Omicron variant, which is spreading faster than any other strain. Yesterday, European stock indexes traded without a single trend. German DAX (DE30) decreased by 1.08%, French CAC 40 (FR40) decreased by 0.69%, British FTSE 100 (UK100) lost 0.18%. At the same time, Spain's IBEX 35 (ES35) added 0.67%. According to CitiBank, inflation expectations in the United Kingdom for December are 4%, while inflation will peak at 5.5% in spring 2022. November’s UK consumer price was 5.1% in annual terms (4.8% was expected). Analysts believe that the Bank of England should immediately tighten its quantitative easing program and seek to raise interest rates. Sweden saw record-high inflation. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England will release their monetary policy decisions on December 16. Crude oil prices continue to decline ahead of the Fed meeting and because of uncertainty in oil demand due to the Omicron option. Yesterday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered oil demand estimates for the current and next year by 100 thousand barrels per day, noting that the emergence of a new strain of COVID-19 will slow but not stop the recovery in fuel demand. Asian stock indexes are also declining as Omicron fears intensify and after China reported its first case of infection with the Omicron strain. China's industrial production increased by 3.8% in annual terms in November, while analysts had expected a 3.6% increase. However, new restrictions to combat the rise in the disease hit retail sales. China's retail sales increased by 3.9% last month compared to an increase of 4.9% in October. In Hong Kong, the government announced last weekend that those returning from the US must spend a week quarantined in a government facility. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HK50) decreased by 1.09%, Australia's ASX 200 Index (AU200) decreased by 0.7%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Index (JP225) added 0.10%.

THE US STOCK MARKET IS SELLING OFF AGAIN. THE BANK OF ENGLAND UNEXPECTEDLY RAISED ITS KEY INTEREST RATE The US stock indices ended Thursday's trading in the red zone. The technology sector saw a strong sell-off, which negatively affected the entire market. The S&amp;P 500 (US500) decreased by 0.9%, the Dow Jones (US30) decreased by 0.1%, and the Nasdaq (US100) lost 2.5%. Meanwhile, the financial sector was the best performing, as investors believe that US Treasury yields will rise in the coming months after the Fed meeting. European stock indices, on the other hand, looked green yesterday. French CAC 40 (FR40) gained 1.12%, German DAX (DE30) added 1.03%, Spanish IBEX (ES35) increased by 1.27%, while British FTSE 100 jumped by 1.25%. The Bank of England unexpectedly raised its key rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. At the same time, the central bank left the volume of the government bond-buying program at the level of 875 billion pounds. The main theses from the head of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey: inflation could reach 6% in the coming months; inflation is also on the rise due to tensions with Russia; Omicron will undoubtedly have a significant impact on economic activity; the labor market is currently very tight. On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised its inflation forecasts and lowered expectations for economic growth in 2022 because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain problems. The ECB expectedly kept its prime rate at zero level, while the deposit rate was left at minus 0.5%. The ECB will end its PEPP program in March 2022. The ECB can also extend PEPP reinvestment until at least the end of 2024. With a high probability, investors should not expect the ECB to raise interest rates in 2022. The ECB's inflation forecasts are 2.6% (revised from 2.2%) for 2021, 3.2% (revised from 1.7%) for 2022, 1.8% (revised from 1.5%) for 2023, and 1.8% for 2024. On Thursday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) remained its ultra-soft monetary policy, deviating from the tightening course that a growing number of central banks are following. The SNB said its current policy, which combines the world's lowest interest rates with intervention in the foreign exchange market, remains appropriate, despite the Swiss franc's rise to six-and-a-half-year highs. As expected, Norway's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate on Thursday and predicts more hikes to follow next year. Germany's regulator doesn't expect Nord Stream 2 to start in the 1st half of 2022. The Turkish lira fell to another record low as Turkey's central bank cut interest rates from another 100 bps to 14%. The Turkish central bank cut its benchmark rate for the 4th consecutive quarter despite a sharp rise in inflation and the lira falling to record lows. The lira lost 51% against the dollar since the beginning of the year. The ECB's oil price forecast: $71.8 per barrel for 2021, $77.5 per barrel for 2022, $72.3 per barrel for 2023, and $69.4 per barrel for 2024. On Thursday, oil prices increased as an indicator of consumer demand for gasoline in the US rising to a record high. Also, the price increase affects a sharp decline in crude oil reserves, which was published on Wednesday. Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday trading on the green territory, except for the Australian stock index. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) increased by 0.2%, Japan's Nikkei index (JP225) added 2.1%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) decreased by 0.4%. Japan has seen a significant increase in exports. It was driven by strong demand from Japanese companies ahead of the holiday season and some easing of supply chain problems. Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region ended Thursday trading on the green territory, except for the Australian stock index. Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) increased by 0.2%, Japan's Nikkei index (JP225) added 2.1%. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) decreased by 0.4%. Japan has seen a significant increase in exports. It was driven by strong demand from Japanese companies ahead of the holiday season and some easing of supply chain problems. The Bank of Japan made no changes to its ultra-soft monetary policy as it monitors the impact of a new variant of the Omicron coronavirus. At the same time, the Bank of Japan decided to cut its funding support program due to the effects of COVID-19 as financing conditions for large companies improve. The interest rate remained unchanged.

THE DOLLAR INDEX IS RISING AMID THE FED'S STATEMENTS ABOUT THE IMMINENT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES Last week, investors were focused on the decision of the central banks in the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, Japan, the Eurozone, and closely watched inflation data in European countries, Great Britain, and Canada. Following Wednesday's FOMC meeting, the US Federal Reserve doubled the pace of reducing the quantitative easing program to $30 billion a month. At the same time, Fed officials forecast 3 rate hikes in 2022 and 3 rate hikes in 2023. On Thursday, the Bank of England unexpectedly raised its key rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. At the same time, the central bank has left the volume of the program of state bond purchase at the level of 875 billion pounds. The European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged but raised its inflation forecasts and lowered expectations for economic growth in 2022 because of the Omicron option. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) stayed true to its ultra-soft monetary policy, deviating from its tightening course. As for inflation, the consumer price index and the producer price index broke records in nearly all countries. It is not surprising that more and more central banks are turning to more aggressive measures to fight inflation, from cutting stimulus programs to raising interest rates. Federal Reserve officials said on Friday that the first interest-rate hike could come as soon as March. Investors began shifting their portfolios back to the "cash," which led to an increase in the dollar index and a decrease in the stock indices quotes. The US stock market closed in the red area on Friday. The Financial sector fell by 2% as 10-year yields fell below 1.4% due to concerns about the impact of the Omicron strain. The Dow Jones index (US30) decreased by 1.48% (-1.65% for the week), the S&amp;P 500 index (US500) decreased by 1.03% (-1.90% for the week), and the NASDAQ technology index (US100) lost 0.07% and became the leader of the fall for the week (-2.89%) among US indices. A Goldman Sachs study found that the US stock market has grown very disproportionately over the past year. The giants TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, and AAPL showed 35% growth in the S&amp;P 500 index. And if you look at April, they gave a total of 50%. FB and AMZN increased slightly, and the remaining 493 companies in the index traded within +-2% over the past year. At the end of each year, the largest investment companies evaluate the prospects for markets and give forecasts for the main stock indices. JPMorgan Chase Bank predicts growth in the US stock market next year. Analysts expect the rise of the S&amp;P 500 index (US500) to 5050 points. The potential growth from current levels is about 8%. The chief strategist of Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, expects that by the end of 2022, the S&amp;P 500 (US500) index will rise to 5100 points (+9%) due to the continued growth of corporate earnings. Morgan Stanley expects the S&amp;P 500 (US500) index to decline to 4,400 points over the next 12 months. Pharmaceutical company Pfizer expects sales of the Covid-19 vaccine to be about $31 billion in 2022. The World Health Organization said a variant of the Omicron coronavirus had been detected in 89 countries. According to the study, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is five times higher than that of the Delta. Scientists predict that Omicron will lead to record hospitalizations and tremendous strain on health care systems in all countries. European stock indexes were traded without a single dynamic on Friday. British FTSE 100 (UK100) gained 0.13% on Friday (-0.30% for the week), German DAX (DE40) decreased by 0.67% (-0.78% for the week), Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) decreased by 0.82% (-0.78% for the week) and French CAC 40 (FR40) lost 1.12% and became the leader of the fall among the main European indices. France's consumer price index increased to 2.8% in November. According to INSEE, the main reasons for the increase were energy prices, industrial goods, and services. Spain's inflation rate reached 5.5%. This is lower than forecast, but the overall picture remains the same: inflation is at its highest level in 29 years and is rising faster than wages. Germany's statistical data showed that producer price inflation reached its highest level since 1951 at 19.2%. Consumer prices in the Eurozone remained at a 4.9% level. Omicron strain infections continue to rise in the UK. The Netherlands imposed a lockdown until January 16 due to an increase in Omicron cases: stores, bars, restaurants, and other public places of prime necessity will be closed from December 19. The EU has extended sanctions against Russia for six months. Asian markets mostly traded in negative territory on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) decreased by 1.79% (-0.56% for the week), Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) decreased by 1.20% (-4.33% for the week), and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) added 0.11% (-0.67% for the week). China's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since the pandemic. The People's Bank of China cut the one-year lending rate to 3.8% from 3.85%. The five-year lending rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 4.65%. In China, domestic gasoline and diesel prices have been lowered since December 18. At the commodities market, futures on orange juice (+9.03%), timber (+1.85%), and palladium (+1.5%) showed the biggest gains by the end of the week. Futures on natural gas (-6.52%), Brent oil (-3.03%), sugar (-2.94%), and WTI crude oil (-2.13%) showed the biggest drop. Oil prices fell again last week, and gold closed above $1,800 a troy ounce for the first time in a month. The decline in oil prices has been attributed to Omicron fears, leading to a drop in fuel demand and last week's sharp drop in crude inventories. Gold ended the week with 1.1% growth, its highest weekly gain since early November. The rise in gold came after the Federal Reserve announced its heightened concern over inflation in the US and began cutting the QE program more quickly while scheduling several interest rate hikes next year. On the one hand, this should, on the contrary, have led to a decline in gold prices. But because of high inflation and low prices for the "yellow metal," investors began to buy gold again as a hedge against inflation.

STOCK MARKETS ARE DECLINING DUE TO RISKS RELATED TO THE RAPID SPREAD OF THE OMICRON STRAIN Yesterday, the US stock market started the week with all three major indices down more than 1% due to concerns over the rapid spread of the Omicron strain, which could potentially slow economic growth and intensify supply chain problems. The Dow Jones Index (US30) closed with a fall of 1.23%, the S&amp;P 500 Index (US500) decreased by 1.14%, while the Nasdaq (US100) lost 1.24%. There is also an alternative view on the reason the stock indices fell. The whole previous year there was a huge injection of liquidity into the stock market due to economic government stimulus. Now the Fed has begun to reduce the QE program, which means that the infusion of liquidity has begun to decrease, and it will stop completely in the spring of 2022. This means that liquidity will begin to slowly "withdraw" from the market from this moment. And together with the overestimated assessments of companies, this all leads to lower stock markets since the "inflated bubble" will "deflate" as liquidity is "withdrawn." According to a Bank of America study, there have been very large outflows from funds investing in developed market stocks this month. Such large outflows occurred during the March 2020 crash and during the December 2018 crash. Therefore, there is every reason to believe that investors should not expect significant growth in stock indices next year. Investor sentiment was also dampened by news that Senator Joe Manchin blocked US President Joe Biden's "Build Back Better" bill. The pharmaceutical company Moderna has provided an update on the booster dose of its 50-microgram vaccine, according to which it increases antibodies against the Omicron strain 37 times. This news may, for a while, remove fears around the new strain of coronavirus, which is positive both for stock indices and for oil quotes. Japanese drugmaker Shionogi announced today that its pill against COVID-19 suppresses the severity of infections caused by the highly transmissible Omicron strain, inspiring optimism that an inexpensive treatment could help prevent a rise in hospitalizations. Clinical trials began in late September and are in the final phase. The company plans to apply for approval in Japan this month. Oil prices continue to fall since the rapid spread of the Omicron virus has strengthened concerns about the outlook for energy demand. But analysts expect oil prices to rebound soon. News of the booster vaccine Moderna is also encouraging. Stock markets in Europe are also decreased due to concerns about the rapid spread of Omicron in the region. The British FTSE 100 (UK100) decreased by 0.99%, German DAX (DE30) lost 1.88%, French CAC 40 (FR40) decreased by 0.82%, Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) fell by 0.83%. Due to a cold snap, electricity prices in Europe increased to a record high on Monday. The Bundesbank predicts the German economy may contract this quarter due to the Omicron strain. A 26-year-old man died in New Zealand whose death may have been caused by a Pfizer vaccine. Asia's stock indexes declined on Monday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HK50) fell by 1.93%, it’s 27% below its peak in early February 2021. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index (JP225) lost 2.13%, and Australia's ASX 200 Index (AU200) decreased by 0.16%. In addition to a potential decline in economic activity due to the spread of the new strain, investors are also worried that Omicron could add to inflationary pressures. And if the situation reaches the point of restrictions at seaports, factories, and other key points for global supply chains, it could worsen the supply crisis that has already erupted. Australia's central bank believes that the Omicron strain will not undermine the ongoing economic recovery and is preparing for early termination of the quantitative easing program if the labor market, inflation, and other economic statistics remain positive. The next meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia will be held in February, where the question of early termination of stimulus will be considered.

STOCK INDICES PLEASED INVESTORS WITH STRONG GAINS BEFORE THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS Wall Street's main indices showed strong gains yesterday, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at an all-time high. The positive for the market is the fact that the concerns of investors at the expense of the seriousness of economic consequences on the Omicron variant decreases. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30) gained 0.55% yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 (US500) added 0.62%, and the Nasdaq Composite Technology Index (US100) jumped by 0.85%. Today is a bank holiday in the USA due to the Christmas holidays. The US stock markets are outperforming stock markets in the rest of the world by most measures in 2 decades. According to Wells Fargo, the US Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates in the second half of 2022. The US airlines United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were forced to cancel more than two hundred flights on the eve of the holidays due to massive COVID-19 infection of flight crews and other workers. United Airlines canceled 120 flights, and Delta Air Lines canceled about 90 flights. European stock indexes followed the US ones yesterday. Germany's DAX (DE30) gained 1.04%, Britain's FTSE 100 (UK100) added 0.43%, France's CAC 40 (FR40) increased by 0.77%, and Spain's IBEX 35 (ES35) jumped by 1.2%. Inflationary pressures continue to rise in Germany. Import prices in Germany increased to 24.7% in annual terms in November. Monthly import prices jumped by a colossal 3% in November, which is three times more than the evaluation. The UK auto production in November 2021 fell to 28.7% in annual terms and amounted to only 75,800 cars, the worst one since November 1984. Today is a short banking day in Europe, and volatility in financial markets will decrease. The Hungarian Central Bank raised interest rates for the 6th time in the last few months to stop inflation and weaken the national currency. The Hungarian forint has lost 2% against the euro and 9% against the dollar since the beginning of the year. Amid falling natural gas futures, the price of gas in Europe fell below $1600 per thousand cubic meters. Yesterday, oil prices continued to rise as the "Omicron" strain was brought under control, which strengthened the prospects for oil demand. The WTI crude futures increased by 1.4% to $73.76 a barrel yesterday. WTI crude oil rose by 4.3% for the week. Asian stock markets are trading without single dynamics today. Japan's Nikkei 225 index (JP225) decreased by 0.05% in today's trading, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HK50) increased by 0.13%, while Australia's main index ASX 200 (AU200) added 0.44%. Japan's core consumer price index posted its biggest year-over-year increase in nearly two years in November due to higher fuel prices, signaling the widening impact of rising global commodity prices. Core inflation, which excludes food prices but includes the cost of oil prices, increased by 0.5% in November. However, this increase is unlikely to prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to reduce monetary stimulus anytime soon since inflation is still far from the central bank's 2% target.

THE US FEDERAL RESERVE'S BALANCE SHEET HITS A NEW RECORD. AIRLINES AROUND THE WORLD CANCEL FLIGHTS OUT OF RISING OMICRON RATES The US Federal Reserve's balance sheet has reached a new record of $8.8 trillion. But it should be noted that the Fed's bond buying pace is declining now. Meanwhile, the Fed's total assets are 38% of the US GDP compared to 82% for the ECB and 133% for the Bank of England. The Fed's balance sheet growth will continue until March 2022, which will have a temporary negative impact on the dollar index, but at the same time, will be a positive factor for the growth of major US stock indices. The US stock market ended pre-Christmas trading higher on Friday. By the end of the trading week, Dow Jones (US30) gained 0.55% (+0.42% for the week), S&amp;P 500 (US500) added 0.62% (+1.58% for the week), NASDAQ Technology Index (US100) increased by 0.85%, and became a growth leader at the end of the week (+4.10%) among US indices. European stock indices were mostly on the rise on Friday. The British FTSE 100 (UK100) decreased by 0.02% (+1.41% for the week), German DAX (DE40) gained 1.04% (+1.00% for the week), Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) jumped by 1.24% (+2.86% for the week), and French CAC 40 (FR40) decreased by 0.28% but added +4.46% on the week's result among major European indices. Today is the bank holiday in most European countries, so low volatility is expected on the market. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that the government had destroyed the "currency bubble" after the central bank took measures last week to protect Turkish lira deposits from volatility. Erdogan also said Turkey's economy would enter a very different environment in the summer thanks to a "new economic model" of low interest rates. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov threatened Europe with a big war because of Ukraine. "The course of dragging Kyiv into NATO with the prospect of the appearance of shock missile systems near our borders creates unacceptable threats to Russia's security, provoking serious military risks for all parties involved, up to a large-scale conflict in Europe," the minister warned. In recent weeks, Oil has heavily depended on the news related to the Omicron coronavirus strain. It is now difficult to predict exactly how European authorities intend to respond to the upsurge of the disease and how severe the restrictions will be during the Christmas vacations. Today black gold prices are decreasing after airlines around the world canceled a total of about 5,900 flights starting from Dec. 24 because of the spread of COVID-19. Gazprom has not booked any pumping capacity through the Yamal pipeline for a week now. As the company explained the day before, now it does not use this route because several customers, particularly from France and Germany, have already fully used all their annual contracted volumes and no longer put up requests for gas supplies. Asian markets mostly traded in positive territory on Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) decreased by 0.06% (+1.61% for the week), Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) added 0.13% (+0.62% for the week), and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) increased by 0.44% (+1.59% for the week). Japan's retail sales rose faster than expected in November thanks to a decline in COVID-19 cases this month, which prompted buyers to increase spending on goods and services. On Friday, Japan's government approved a record $940 billion budget for the fiscal year 2022. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy is now aimed at actively stimulating the economy. China Evergrande's chairman promised to deliver thousands of apartments in December. China's real estate index increased by 2.5% on this news. At the commodities market, palladium (+8.89%), wheat (+5.19%), fuel oil (+4.96%), soybeans (+4.45%), WTI oil (+4.3%), platinum (+4.29%), Brent oil (+3.18%), copper (+2.56%) and corn (+2.28%) futures showed the biggest gains for the last week. Lumber (-3.37%) and orange juice (-1.54%) futures showed the biggest drop.

US INDICES ARE GOING FOR RECORDS AND OIL IS STABLE Yesterday, the US stock market traded without a single trend. The S&amp;P 500 index (US500) decreased by 0.1%, the Nasdaq technology index (US100) lost 0.56%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30) gained 0.26% and rose for the fifth straight trading session, the longest uninterrupted period of growth in two months. Since the beginning of the current year, the Dow Jones (US30) has gained nearly 19%, the S&amp;P 500 (US500) added more than 27%, the Nasdaq (US100) increased by 22.5%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 index showed a larger gain for 2021 than the Nasdaq index for the first time since 2016. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reduced the recommended isolation time for Americans with asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 infection to five days from 10 days previously. The CDC has issued new recommendations, as well as the approval of new pills and vaccines against COVID-19. This helped investors not respond sharply to the cancellation of thousands of flights and the closure of Apple stores due to increased illness among employees. European stock indices mostly rose yesterday. Germany's DAX (DE30) increased by 0.81%, France's CAC 40 (FR40) gained 0.57% and Spain's IBEX (ES35) added 0.77%. Spain's retail sales index jumped by 4.9% in November. The sales did not grow four months in a row. The ECB began to reduce the pace of buying assets. These are the first steps toward ending the PEPP program next year and raising the issue of an interest rate hike. But analysts agree that the ECB will not raise the rates before 2023. On Tuesday, Asian stock indexes were mixed and are decreasing at the opening on Wednesday. Traders negatively weigh the economic growth risks associated with the Omicron virus outbreak and the latest regulatory tightening in China. In Asia, there are relatively few cases of infection with a strain Оmicron compared to European countries and the United States. Despite this fact, investors are growing concerned that the rise in the disease will lead to lockdowns and new problems in supply chains. But the Australian stock market, which opened on Wednesday for the first time since the Christmas holiday, saw strong gains. The Australian ASX 200 Index (AU200) jumped by 1.21% from the open. The data from the American Petroleum Institute showed that US crude oil inventories fell by 3.1 million barrels last week, which was in line with analysts' expectations. The oil keeps its upward trend as Omicron risks to demand decrease while inventories are also declining, causing a weak deficit. The US Department of Energy will release its report on crude oil inventories today. The number of tankers carrying gas from the US to Europe has increased by a third. This suggests that Europe does not have enough reserves to pass the heating season.

Don't want to be jabbed,ok swallow a pill lol. There is little to fear from Omicron, as it is a mild variant, and there is no reason to panic. Omicron primarily induces mild disease and, as evidence, in South Africa, there has been no increase in hospitalizations or intensive care units, despite the increase in cases.There is a reason why many are dying.....I've been studying this more than forex.The reversal procedure is simple,no hospitalization neither oxygen.NEVER fear what you UNDERSTAND! I live in the country with the world's highest deaths per million population ,just imagine the situation. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

TODAY ALL INVESTORS' ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON NON-FARM PAYROLLS DATA IN THE US AND THE INFLATION RATE IN EUROZONE The US stock market ended Thursday's trading with a decline amid negative dynamics from the utilities and healthcare sectors. By the close of the trading day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (US30) decreased by 0.47%, the S&amp;P 500 (US500) fell by 0.10%, and the NASDAQ Composite (US100) lost 0.13%. The number of new jobless claims in the US was 207,000, while analysts expected 194,500. But the market participants are still confident in the economic recovery, especially in the labor market, and expect the monthly job gains in December to recover after the weak November data. Economists are predicting that the US economy will create 400,000 jobs in December. The good data may further strengthen the dollar index ahead of an interest rate hike. Bank of America raised its target for Tesla to $1,300 a share. European stock indices closed yesterday in the red zone. By the end of the day, German DAX (DE30) lost 1.35%, French CAC 40 (FR40) decreased by 1.72%, British FTSE 100 (UK100) fell by 0.88%, and Spanish IBEX 35 fell by 0.90%. German inflation accelerated to 5.3% in December. The last time German inflation was 5.3%, the Bundesbank's key interest rate was 8.6%. Today, the ECB's key rate remains at 0%. Analysts expect the ECB to raise interest rates by 10-15 basis points in October-December 2022. In November, German industrial production fell unexpectedly, indicating that the recovery in the manufacturing sector is weakening. On an annualized basis, German industrial production fell to 2.4%. Eurozone inflation data will be released today. Economists are predicting that inflation will remain the same or even decrease slightly. Oil prices have exceeded $80 per barrel on unrest in Kazakhstan and supply disruptions in Libya. Still, analysts are confident the price could exhaust itself soon as the Omicron strain continues to threaten demand at a time when supply should increase in the first quarter because of the release of strategic reserves. Yesterday, gold decreased by 2% and broke down support at $1,800 an ounce. News of a rate hike is almost always negative for gold, which was reflected to some extent last year when gold ended 2021 down 3.6%, its first annual decline in three years and the biggest drop since 2015. But some analysts believe that if US inflation continues to rise through 2022, gold could rise again and even update the price highs of $2,100, which, by the way, happened against the background of concerns about the sharp rise in price pressure. Asian stock indices closed lower yesterday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index (JP225) decreased by 2.9%, Australia's ASX 200 Index (AU200) lost 2.7%, the exception was Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50), which gained 0.7%. The benchmark consumer price index (CPI) in Japan's capital, which includes oil prices but excludes food prices, increased by 0.5% in December from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year increase since February 2020. Meanwhile, inflation-adjusted wages fell 1.6% in annual terms, declining for the third month straight. Such data does not foresee a stronger economic recovery.

NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA ARE TAKING PLACE IN ISTANBUL TODAY. INVESTORS ARE OPTIMISTIC, BUT ANALYSTS ARE NOT Yesterday, all three US indices closed in the green zone. Dow Jones (US30) gained 0.27%, S&amp;P 500 (US500) added 0.71%, the NASDAQ Technology Index (US100) jumped by 1.31% on Monday. US government bond yields remain close to a three-year high as investors gear up for the Federal Reserve's rate hike campaign. This plays in favor of a stronger dollar index against other currencies. US President Joe Biden submitted to Congress a budget proposal for the next fiscal year beginning October 1. Under Biden's budget plan, corporate executives would be required to own the company's shares they received for several years after purchasing it and would be prohibited from selling shares for several years after the share buyback. This would deprive corporations of using profits to buy back shares for the benefit of executives. The plan also includes $5.79 trillion in defense spending, aid to Ukraine, higher taxes on the richest Americans and companies, and a reduction in the national deficit. Tesla will seek shareholder approval for a share split to pave the way for dividend payments to shareholders. Yesterday, the company's shares increased by 8% on this news. Bloomberg will disconnect Russian users from its terminal. Access to the terminals has already been blocked for several Russian banks that have fallen under Western sanctions. Major European indices were mostly on the rise yesterday. German DAX (DE30) gained 0.79% yesterday, French CAC 40 (FR 40) added 0.54%, Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) increased by 0.42%, British FTSE 100 (UK100) decreased by 0.14%. Investors continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Ukraine. The next round of talks between the delegations of Ukraine and Russia is taking place in Istanbul today. This will be the fourth attempt to find a common language. The last three attempts were unsuccessful. But judging by the preliminary comments of the Ukrainian and Russian Foreign Ministries representatives, the negotiations will not be final, and investors should not expect a settlement agreement. But investors are optimistic because almost everyone involved, including Europe, is losing the war in Ukraine financially and economically. The US and China are in a better position, but even there, the negative economic impact of the war is present. The EU expanded sanctions against Russia through the "50% rule". Companies in which two or more sanctioned individuals jointly own the majority of shares are now blacklisted, even if none of them owns more than 50%. The sanctions "50% rule" has been in effect in the US since 2008. It is not yet applied in the EU. The energy sector has had the most impact on the market as a whole, as concerns that the lockdown in China could dampen demand. On the contrary, peace talks between Ukraine and Russia have somewhat cooled fears of supply disruptions. This situation allowed oil prices to correct, but it should be noted that this is a temporary phenomenon as the market deficit persist. Asian markets traded without a single trend yesterday. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) decreased by 0.73% yesterday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) gained 1.31%, and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) added 0.08%. Today, stock indices in the Asia-Pacific region (APR) are rising. Japan's unemployment rate fell to 2.7% in February from 2.8% a month earlier. Investors are also watching the spread of the coronavirus in Shanghai, one of China's largest industrial and commercial centers. A nine-day lockdown was imposed the day before, the largest in two years. The Shanghai lockdown will be divided into two phases. Shanghai's Pudong economic region and surrounding areas will be closed from Monday to Friday in the first phase. The second phase will begin on Friday when the central part of Shanghai will be closed for lockdown. During these periods, residents will be required to stay at home, offices and businesses not considered essential will be closed, and public transport will be suspended. Also, during the lockdown, mass testing for COVID-19 is carried out in the city.

INVESTORS ARE OPTIMISTIC AMID LITTLE PROGRESS IN TALKS BETWEEN UKRAINE AND RUSSIA The S&amp;P 500 increased on Tuesday as rising hopes for a de-escalation of the Ukraine-Russia conflict helped stocks shrug off further bond market signals of a potential recession. All three US indices closed in green territory yesterday. The Dow Jones Index (US30) gained 0.97%, the S&amp;P 500 Index (US500) increased by 1.23%, and the NASDAQ Technology Index (US100) added 1.84%. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds temporarily fell below the 2-year Treasury yield for the first time since 2019. Such an event is called a yield curve inversion. It's should be noted that a yield curve inversion has preceded every recession in the past 40 years. The US Federal Reserve is trying to weigh what strategy to choose to suppress inflation in a way that does not stop economic growth. Many analysts believe that it will be difficult to find a middle ground here, and the US Fed will have to sacrifice economic recovery to reduce inflation. This week's employment data will also be taken into account by the Fed when deciding at the May meeting. Bank of America is forecasting three consecutive 50 basis point interest rate hikes. Yesterday, major European indices jumped significantly against the background of the first steps in the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. The German DAX (DE30) jumped by 2.79%, French CAC 40 (FR 40) added 3.08%, Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) increased by 2.98%, British FTSE 100 (UK100) gained 0.86%. Germany's consumer confidence index fell to a 14-month low amid the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. The consumer confidence index in France also declined. Spain's consumer price index unexpectedly jumped from 7.6% to 9.8% year on year. This is the highest value in 30 years. Rising inflation in European countries may force the ECB to revise monetary policy towards tightening. Some progress was made during the talks in Istanbul between Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine is secured in a non-bloc and non-nuclear status without foreign military bases but with security guarantees from guarantor countries (UN Security Council+ states) under the principle of NATO Article 5. Among the guarantors are the countries of the UN Security Council, the United States, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Poland, and Israel. With such guarantees, which are equivalent to article 5 of NATO, Ukraine will also not join military-political alliances. But nothing should contradict Ukraine's right to join the EU. The issue of Crimea is resolved non-military through a bilateral negotiation process, which is given 15 years. The issue of ORLO (LNR and DNR) is resolved separately at the level of the meeting of the presidents of Ukraine and Russia. Russia is taking two steps to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that Russia had decided to reduce hostilities in the Kyiv and Chernihiv directions. However, this does not mean a ceasefire. The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine believes that the withdrawal of Russian-fascist troops is probably a rotation of individual units and is intended to mislead the military leadership of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) and create a false image that the occupiers abandoned the plot to encircle the city of Kyiv. At the same time, British intelligence reports that having been convinced of the impossibility of encircling Kyiv, Russia decided to reduce its activity in this direction and transfer part of its forces to the Donetsk and Lugansk sectors of the front to get the South-East of Ukraine and create for itself a land corridor to the Crimea. At the same time, US sources indicate that Russia is not withdrawing troops, but is moving them around Kyiv. Despite some negotiations, the shelling of Ukraine from the territory of Belarus has become more frequent. Almost all missile launches on Ukrainian territory yesterday were made from Belarus, from the areas of Mozyr and Khoiniki. Every day Russia confirms that it is a terrorist state. By starting the war in Ukraine, Putin has already created a global food crisis. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said Russia's war in Ukraine has led to critical food shortages in Ukraine, and the effects of the "global food crisis" are being felt around the world. Sherman also noted that Russia attacked at least three civilian ships carrying supplies from the Black Sea. The Russian Navy is blocking access to Ukrainian ports, depriving Ukraine of its ability to export grain and preventing 94 food ships from entering the Mediterranean Sea. It should also be noted that in Ukraine, the Russians are purposefully destroying food warehouses, thereby increasing the humanitarian catastrophe. Asian markets closed higher yesterday. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) gained 1.10% yesterday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) added 1.12% and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) ended the day with +0.70%. Asian stock indices are also generally growing today. The exception is the Japanese market, where negative investor sentiment was caused by fears of a new outbreak of COVID-19 disease. Retail sales in Japan fell 0.8% in February from the same month a year earlier. The fall was recorded for the first time since last September.

The secret about how to only show your wins and not your losses to make it look like you are actually profitable? Or how you randomly mention a telegram using those stupid emoticons like every scamming signal service out there, but of course you dont mean to commercialize anything. You just wanted to show your telegram channel for fun. You call this thread a swing trading channel when you are scalping the 1minute timeframe. You dont even know the difference. Dont scam people. Start educating and giving signals once you are actually profitable. Clown. Dont even bother replying.

THE PANIC NARRATIVE IS RETURNING TO THE STOCK MARKETS. THE FOCUS TODAY IS ON A NON-FARM REPORT The US 10-year bond yields rose nearly 10 basis points to 3.85% after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said yesterday that the central bank is "very far" from suspending its tightening campaign. Kashkari's comments followed a series of hawkish remarks from other officials. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Thursday that the US Central Bank's discount rate is likely to reach 4.5-4.75% by the spring of 2023 as the Fed increases the cost of borrowing to reduce too much inflation. A day earlier, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said that investors are wrong to anticipate monetary policy easing in 2023. Such hawkish rhetoric brought negativity back to the financial markets, which triggered some sell-off in stocks. At the close of the stock market yesterday, the Dow Jones Index (US30) decreased by 1.15%, and the S&amp;P 500 Index (US500) fell by 1.30%. Tech Index NASDAQ (US100) closed the day down by 0.35%. At the Fed meeting in November, money markets are pricing in a more than 85% chance of a fourth straight 75 basis point rate hike. Today, the main focus for investors will be on the US labor market data. If the report turns negative, it could trigger a drop in the dollar index and a rise in stock indices on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in tightening monetary policy further. But if the non-farm payrolls report is positive and shows the strength of the labor market, the opposite reaction could follow a sell-off in the stock market plus an increase in the dollar index and treasury yields. Weekly labor market data showed that the number of Americans filing new jobless claims rose more than expected last week, but the labor market remains strong even as demand declines amid higher interest rates. Stock markets in Europe were mostly down yesterday. German DAX (DE30) decreased by 0.37%, French CAC 40 (FR40) fell by 0.82%, Spanish IBEX 35 (ES35) lost 0.92%, British FTSE 100 (UK100) closed down by 0.78%. The report on the ECB's September 7-8 monetary policy meeting released yesterday showed that an absolute majority approved a 75 basis point rate hike of the Governing Council. The report also indicated that in the medium term, a 50 basis point hike would be part of a sustainable path toward more neutral rate levels, and such a dynamic would be sufficient to alleviate inflationary pressures and not "drop" the economy deep into recession. But all inflation forecasts for 2023 and 2024 have been revised upward. In August 2022, seasonally adjusted retail sales were down by 0.3% in the Eurozone. Retail sales also declined by 0.4% in July. This is negative data, which indirectly points to high inflationary pressures. Oil prices rose about 1% on Thursday, holding at a three-week high after OPEC+ agreed to cut global supply by 2 million BPD, the biggest cut since 2020. Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the real supply cut would be 1 million to 1.1 million BPD. Experts believe that such a move by OPEC+ will not only boost oil prices but also cause a new round of unwinding inflation, which central banks around the world are actively fighting. Asian markets traded flat yesterday. Japan's Nikkei 225 (JP225) gained 0.70%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HK50) decreased by 0.42%, and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 (AU200) ended the day up by 0.03%. A report released Thursday by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) indicates that most regional economies in Japan are seeing a moderate rebound, with some firms considering wage increases, stressing the hope that household incomes will rise enough to offset rising costs of living.
