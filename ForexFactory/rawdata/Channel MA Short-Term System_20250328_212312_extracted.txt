About Me I have been trading for 12 years now, and for most of this time I've made my living from the market, or from market-related business. I have traded many systems, of mine and of others, with various levels of success. For about 4 years I have settled on this system, which fits my financial objectives, my trading style and my psychological profile. I have consistently been successful trading it, and for years I felt no need to try any other on my live accounts. I have decided to make the step towards sharing and discussing it, for 2 reasons: one is to give back to this community, where I've been lurking for many years, and from where I took many ideas and learned a lot. The second is more selfish: I'm looking for help in coding an EA for the system, since the technical work is probably not too difficult and the benefit for us all would certainly be worth it. And also, I'm looking to share what I know so far in successfully trading it manually, in order for us all to make it a success in automated trading as well. My schedule lately is more and more busy, I want to keep trading but at the same time I feel like manual trading is starting to be a burden for me, and because I have extensive experience with this simple system and already took almost everything I could from trading it manually, i feel this step is the logical one at this time. The System – General Stuff I started trading as an Elliott Wave guy (a method I still value a lot and prefer for market analysis, for its detailed insights into all kinds of scenarios), but at the same time I have always been fascinated by MA crossover systems, for their extreme simplicity. I always thought I could find the "perfect" MA crossover combination that would work universally, and spent years trying and testing such crossovers. As you can probably guess, I found there is no such thing I have started to be successful with MAs when using the Rainbow template (which I still consider very good for identifying levels and diagnosing trends), but it needed "analysis", and I wanted something even more simple, faster, easier to trade on the go. Then, about 4 years ago, a simple idea crossed my mind: the MA crossover systems are all perfect in trending conditions, but their main (and major!) problem was their repeated small losses in sideways markets. What if I could find a way to avoid that noise, and filter most of it out? That's how the idea of channel trading the MAs was born. I tested, and immediately found it to be a huge improvement, even at a first glance. Without much concern for the "perfect" MAs, I chose a channel defined by MAs I had used before (55), and I made a few days' testing to find a signal line. I applied it retrospectively on some pairs, and it seemed to work. Then I introduced a few more rigid rules, and it worked like that as well. I started trading it live (taking into account the rainbow levels, too) and within a few weeks I was consistently profitable. Then I started to trade this system exclusively, and since then I only traded this strategy, with a few minor variations (money management, stops, scaling in, choice of pairs). The system is extremely simple. Chart Settings M15 Chart (but the principle works on larger charts as well) 55 EMA, applied to low + 55 EMA, applied to high = the channel. 33 EMA applied to close = signal line. System Rules: Long signal: signal line crosses above channel (33EMA applied to close crosses ABOVE 55EMA applied to high) Short signal: signal line crosses below channel (33EMA applied to close crosses BELOW 55EMA applied to low). STOPS: Hard stop: 40-50pips (depending on pair and situation) No stop: close &amp; reverse at opposite signal. TARGETS: Fixed tp: 40pips, with SL moved to break even when price reaches 20-25pips profit. (needs a lot of management, and only works if you handle few pairs) Flexible tp: set at 210 pips, and trade closed at the end of the session (I do this many times, and it seems the best option). No tp: trade is closed at opposite signal in profit. There are 2 entries: Normal Entry : the crossover happens within regular volatility conditions, with price close to the channel (a SL placed at 40-50pips distance from entry would be placed on the other side of the channel, so the channel becomes a "barrier" between current price and SL). The trade is executed immediately according to the rules. Delayed Entry : the crossover happens as a result of extreme volatility, with price far from the channel (more than 40pips), so an attempt to put a hard SL would result in the SL being placed inside the channel, or on the same side of it as the entry. In this case, the trade is not immediately executed, and instead a pending order is placed at the level of the signal MA (the order should fill when price touches again the signal 33EMA). The order remains valid for as long as the signal is valid, and usually is filled. The delayed entry is meant to ensure that there is enough room and power for a move in favor of a signal, and that we do not enter at the end of a push. I have found the channel to be a pretty strong obstacle, especially in such situations, and so I always aim to have my stop protected by the channel. System Advantages: Simplicity: quite obvious, no need for further explanations. All trading is done in the direction of the short-term trend. Absolutely no top or bottom picking: very good for traders who struggle with discipline. Controlled risk, but high profit potential (if used without fixed 40pips tp) MA noise and false signals filtered up to 80%, while still receiving early M15 signals to ride the big moves. Possibility to use as an entry system only, with analysis done on larger timeframes (for those already fond of other analysis methods, longer-term). Even if there are many failed signals, the losses are small and the losing trades get closed out quickly, while the correct signals (more in number) can make profits of 100-200pips easily, every week. Possibility to trade a basket of currencies, with focus on overall equity and not the individual signals (the option I'd like to explore with you guys here). I want to use the system on a larger basket of pairs, but was unable so far because it's difficult to take all signals and manage them if trading is done manually. I read and appreciated a thread here in FF, something like "set and forget basket trading". Those guys do exactly what I plan to do here, with the only difference that their signals are given by other indicators, and are the same for the whole week. I liked their work, and I admired their system, which in spite of its rigid setup seems to work pretty good. The channel system could be more versatile when traded as a basket, and we could enjoy the benefits of basket trading while still being very quick in adapting to market conditions, because no matter what the market does, we are NEVER against the trend for more than 40-50pips. If the market makes large moves in favor of a certain currency, all the pairs involved will bank in hundreds of pips (over 4-5 correlated pairs more than 1000pips can be reached within the week). In choppy market conditions the system does ok, breaks even or can even make small losses, but in strong trends (on any currency) the system makes huge profits. Considering that each currency has its own time of rally which may not coincide with the others, with a good EA we can be there EVERY TIME the market moves rapidly and never miss any large swing, because the small chart it works on (M15) will push us in very early. The EA would have to take the rules into account (especially the delayed entry), have an option for taking all signals/crossovers or just the first one (the one that changes the bias from long to short and viceversa), and have the option of hard SL/TP or flexible (close at next signal). We can discuss all that here, I hope. I would love to offer any kind of feedback to those of you trying it out, and also to work together towards making it an automated system generating a minimum of 500pips monthly (in manual trading I usually got more than that). Please share your testing and let's make some pips together!

Thanks MickeyMar for sharing your system and experience...

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi .... does it work on the day?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Very interesting, thank you Mickey! Subscribed :-)

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thank you for posting Mickey.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks Mickey, this looks to a great system and thank you for taking the time and effort to share it with us. I am in and excited as I really like to use the MA crossovers.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
System Rules: Long signal: signal line crosses below channel (below 55EMA applied to low) Short signal: signal line crosses above channer (above 55EMA applied to high). I don't understand the rules sorry, Should I long when the signal line crosses below the channel? The pictures you posted contradicts this statement.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Nice introduction, waiting for more

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Means to say.. Long :When 33 EMA crosses the upper band (of channel of 55 EMA) from BELOW To UPPER side .... &amp; Short :When 33 EMA crosses the lower band (of channel of 55 EMA) from UPPER side to BELOW.. Am I right... MickeyMar?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Do you have successful trading exposure? I'm also a fan of the average crossing system, because I've designed a similar strategy, just a little difference in the parameters of moving averages, but the trading results are not very ideal.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Correct, an error slipped in when I pasted from the word doc. Fixed now. Long is when signal crosses ABOVE the channel, short when it goes BELOW. Thanks for pointing it out.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks like a cool system and I want to propose two questions: 1) What if you exit the trade once the opposite signal is generated? This could increase profit potential during strong trends... 2) What if the 33-MA was rather a 33 period Bollinger Band and once the 33-MA from the BB crosses the channel, wait for a pullback to the lower band (buy signal) or upper band (sell signal)? This could potentially eliminate early entries...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Mickey, great simple system, what pairs do you trade and what time Europe open to close or UK open to close? Also, would this EA trade 24 Hours a day? And when you say Flexible tp: set at 210 pips, and trade closed at the end of the session (I do this many times, and it seems the best option). This session is that UK session/US session or the day? And lastly, what do you do about red news?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Subscribed. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for sharing! It's really interesting, I want to test it. What is the session do you use to trade it? In case of "Flexible target", when do you mean to close all your trades? London close, NY close?? thanks you TONI

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Maybe I missed it, but which Time Frame are you trading? Thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
He mention it as 15M

--- 帖子 #18 ---
First of all guys, thank you all for the positive response. I feel that together we can make the best of this system, and hopefully manage to start trading it via EA (automated). I will try answering all questions. Cix79, Im not sure what you mean by "does it work on the day" - the principle of the channel works everywhere MA crossovers are used, and it will filter out noise, for sure. But I'm not sure if these precise settings will be any good other than giving you an orientation on the larger charts. I only used it on M15 (extensively) and H1 (just to see how it behaves). The main point why I came up with this system was that I needed a short-term strategy that would ALSO catch 150-250pips moves, and one that would discipline me in never going against the current market move, in the hope for a turn. The system is perfect for this, and if you are a mid-term trader you can still catch the new trend right in the early stage, because of the very small M15 chart the system uses. At the same time, this system manages to keep your risk very low (it MUST be maximum 50pips, if not the entry will be delayed as per the rules!), so this is an advantage over systems trading larger timeframes (with larger stops, of course). The trading results are very good indeed, but I admit to using some discretion sometimes, especially in exiting and scaling in. The system has clear stops, limited to 50pips - but the targets are not equally clear, because the hourly trends can be quite long and powerful, and with one such risk a trader can make anywhere between 20pips and 300pips (some signals on some pairs make more than that). Lifestudent3 - you make a good point, and yes, it's good to wait the trend to follow its course and close when an opposite signal arises. But this will not necessarily make you THE MOST pips. From my experience, the most pips are made when the close is done right at the end of a trading session (can be any of them), for me it's usually US, because I trade London &amp; NY. Also, it depends if I have other trades in the same direction... This is exactly why I want to explore basket trading this system, as I'm pretty sure the results will be much better if we allow more opportunities to grow, on more pairs. The EA would generally trade around the clock, yes - but a filter could be used against opening positions in Asia, for instance, so we can experiment with timing. About the news: I make sure I'm aware of them, and tighten the risk right before the announcement. If the SL is hit, I am usually pushed out quickly, before a much larger move develops (the opposite signal does not come too quickly, as it will probably be delayed). Usually, since I am ALWAYS trading with the trend, with the move active in the market at any time, the news tend to CONTINUE that move, rather than go against it. I'd say Im around 60% likely to have my trades favored by news, in general. Which is good enough for me. I do NOT close before news, ever - because all my study and testing included these large moves caused by news, and it's VOLATILITY, and I'm with the trend. I have no reason to refuse volatility, especially since I'm on the right side of the market. And by definition, I will always be. In case of extremely choppy news, with say 100pips in one direction, then 150 in the other, the channel will make sure I am not going in and out with many losses... So even if the worst happens, I'm usually out with 1 loss, then I can re-assess the situation and get back on the horse in the correct move. Finally: guys, his system has many losing trades, as moving averages are not predictive in nature. There are on average some 20trades in a month per pair, out of which some 8-9 are losing trades (even if slightly in negative). I have no problem with all that, as my monthly target is 500pips, and there are many opportunities to make them across just a few pairs, with minimal discretion (closing at good levels). But even if you make it a rule to take profit around 40, from my experience you should still be profitable if you trade 3 pairs. My favorite are: USDJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD. The very volatile crosses give more losing signals, but since their volatility is much higher when a good trend is caught it covers easily 3-4 losses in one move. This is exactly why I am thinking to trade the system as a basket of 15-20 pairs, with calculated correlations, so as to minimize overall risk and never miss huge short-term moves (there are 2-3 almost every week, across all pairs). Thanks again for all your feedback, it's much appreciated. Anyone willing to take a look at the rules and try an EA, that we could all share, improve and use? Cheers!

My first trade with this sys, closed partial, today most of the pairs are ranging, will forward test it and post it here.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Very nice of you for sharing! Mickeymouse, what does it mean delayed entry? How do you enter on the delayed entry?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Mickey - I am new to this so please excuse my "noobness". I was working on your plan this morning. Put the indicators on my chart and found this.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) If there was a SHORT ENTRY and some profit and then a sharp move against me, I would have stopped out and if I had used a trailer, at say 50 pips, my loss would have been fairly small. The system did not signal to go LONG with the spike up (good thing) and then it looks like there would have been another SHORT re-entry, which is still running for great profit. Am I reading this correctly?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Let me give you guys a sample of how I use the system - taking today as an example. EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Today we had a very early signal reconfirmation (because the original signal short is from October 12. I don't trade at those hours, so I found it in the morning at 1.1778, some 12pips lower than the signal. Since a 20pips stop around 1.18 was at the time on the other side of the channel, there was an opportunity to short intraday. Of course, if the trade had been taken at the signal reconfirmation, or on Oct.12, we would have done nothing else than watch the pips grow GBPUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Well done Bandit. If you had caught the signal when it originally came out, you'd have made twice as much good job. Guys, I posted indicators and template in the first post. The arrows are my improvisation, from some indicator I found here on the factory. Would be nice if we designed another one

--- 帖子 #24 ---
See the first post, and the chart examples. The delayed entry is simply an order to sell or buy (according to the signal which came out too far from the channel), when price reaches the level of the signal MA (33EMA applied to close). Or you can manually take it, as close to the channel as possible.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
EU trade

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Bandit, Thanks for posting. It seems to me that in both your posted trades you entered late (long after signal MA crossed the channel MAs). What's the reason? What other considerations delayed entry? Does MickeyMar have any thoughts on this? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
One suggestion would be to ignore signals prior to either Frankfurt or London open, regarding use of EA. Perhaps with the exception of Aud, Nzd &amp; Yen pairs. Generally the distance between 55's is 7-10 pips. Adding the 33 cross, &amp; close, maybe enough of a buffer, even during non major market times. MM, you, apparently, have been tracking this for a while. What is your opinion on this? Sorry, I see you already answered this. Did not refresh thread after being open for a few hours.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi MickeyMar, Thanks for sharing your strategy, it looks very interesting! Attached is a quick first version EA that follows your rules, with a hard SL an TP for this first version. It looks profitable on some pairs but I'm sure we can improve it a lot Please check it and let me know if I understood all your rules correctly.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
ill wait for a retrenchment of the price on 5M and i dont sell or buy with market order,i always go with pending sell/buy, this my way of entering the trade , nothing to do with the original method

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Looks interesting - subscribed - thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Yes, it's true Bandit entered late but I'm assuming he doesn't sleep on the PC, so probably he saw the signals late and followed them as he could. I do that too, as I said I have no EA so I can't be that precise, I've always used discretion. That's what he did, too. Marc, yes, the signals you point out are correct. You see... if we had used the EA, probably we'd still be in that original EU short - but in discretionary trading you could have taken some pips first, then be stopped out, and then re-enter on the reconfirmation (new cross) and go all the way down to where it is now, close it now, or keep it running. Both approaches are ok. I tend to favor the first approach, because entering with the FIRST signal and staying in, together with other 15-20 pairs, could take our equity way up, and when we hit say, 10% of the account, or more, we can close them altogether and then re-enter signals as they re-emerge. We will explore this scenario with the EA made by Damien, which I'm testing now. Thanks Damiend! Diamond - yes, would be nice to have an hour filter, that we can use for non-jpy, aud, nzd and usd pairs. I don't really need to take a signal on EURGBP in the middle of the Asian session... Another useful filter would be the option to use just "first signal" (the first time market changes direction, and not re-enter on the reconfirmations after that - new crossovers), or enter a new lot for each crossover, even if it just reconfirms the original direction. Could we put that on, Damiend?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hey Mickey do you have to monitor the trades or can you open the trade at start of London session for example and close at NY close??

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The EA should have one very important feature, without which the results would be a total mess (I don't know if the current EA has it, because i can't see the code): the signals should be considered valid only if they are PRINTED on the chart, meaning only AFTER THE M15 CANDLE CLOSE . Many times the indicator i have gives a signal, only to dissapear at the close of the candle (because price goes back before candle close and the signal MA pulls back as well, invalidating the signal). Also, an option "no tp, close at opposite signal" (and reverse), and the possibility to combine with a fixed (200pips fixed TP but close on opposite signal, for example). What do you think Damien?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
interesting thought! I have always monitored, because I've used discretion. But with an EA, we won't have to. However, it would be nice to know what would happen if we traded the system the way you suggest... like: open a trade on the current active signal and just follow from there all the way until time "x" (end of session), when all would be closed. The EA could maybe have an option "open trade immediately", which would make the EA take a trade in the direction of the current active signal, without waiting for a new one or a reconfirmation, as it does now. But probably i'd still prefer the "entry at signal" option, because a good entry is essential for the system to work well (its money management depends on an entry close to the channel).

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I reset my balance in my Paper Trade account to $49,653.64. I added three new charts, all 15M...USDJPY, EURUSD, and GBPUSD. These are the three Mickey mentions as his favorites right now. I have all three charts on AutoTrading. It is now 11:07 AM EST (Chicago Time). Just like fishing with a tilt up...I'm gonna go to lunch and when I come back, maybe I caught something!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Mickey, Great way of escaping ranging market conditions. What is the reason for the EMA? A LWMA gives an earlier entry.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
The reason has to do with what you just mentioned - escaping ranging markets. If we enter too quickly we may be too early, or not escape a choppy period. My main objective was to keep the system COMPLETELY OUT when the pair I trade is being choppy The EA works, but the entries do not wait for the candle close (first fix we need to do) and the EA takes reconfirmation signals (we need to keep this as an option, but add a filter to only trade FIRST signals, which is the core strategy). Can't wait to see a delayed entry in real time, I'm excited

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I just applied the template to a few markets on Global prime M15 charts. Looks GREAT! I like that it's simple. I had to fight the urge to put a few more confirmations in there and just let the cross speak for itself. Thanks so much for sharing. I'm subscribed and will add value when I can

--- 帖子 #39 ---
yea, I know what you're saying... I thought of a thousand additional filters myself but in the end, the simplicity is its advantage. One filter only I found to be worth while and making results more "stable" in the mid-term and long-term: taking only the signals confirmed by the H1 system as well, which means you would take on M15 ALL there is in the same direction as the H1 cross, and ignore the rest. But I'd rather not insist on this filter yet, we will have time to explore it later.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thank you very much Mickey for this great strategy. I have another strategy which I use every day with good success, but your strategy I a good addition for me to filter my trades and to find the point, where I have to close my trade... Thank you for that! Good job!!!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi can you please share your template .Thanks

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thanks Mickey. Really wonderful on your part to share your work so generously... On 15 Minutes Time Frame, there are arrows that correspond to the Buy and Sell signals. Could you please incorporate the same/arrows for other time frames like 1HR,4HR etc... Thanks

--- 帖子 #43 ---
i'm already GU short....would this setup still be a valid "re-entry" off the trend line???

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I like this system for avoiding choppy markets, here is my simple contribution to this thread. An arrow indicator for any time-frame... no alerts though.. i personally don't like them Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks alot !

MM, after staring at your chart set up for hours, I noticed a repeating set up within the set up. Once the 33 enters the channel, I watch for Price to close on the opposite side of channel. Then I wait for price to retrace to within 3 pips of 33, and enter there, with a 20-25 pip SL, depending on spread &amp; overall market conditions. In my overall observations, price tends to rarely travel less than 20 pips in desired direction. Also, this entry is usually 15 to 25 pips sooner than following basic entry. Screenshot is of EurAud on April 20, this year. It's not my intention to highjack this thread. I hope this may simply add to it.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Aaven: on my template (shared in the first post) all you need to do is right click BOTH a red AND a green arrow, and under "visualization" check all timeframes, and it will appear. I simply didn't want signals on all TF, that's why I removed them. Or I think Sedric's posted indicator is already set for all timeframes, so you can use that instead. mine is actually an improvisation But guys, make sure you take only signals PRINTED on the chart, where the crossover happened - do not trade signals on candles not yet closed, cuz you will experience a lot of bad entries. Kaiser: yea, you got it right. The move on GU was clearly bear, but the system will have you wait for an entry close to the channel, simply for risk management purposes. If you look at my GU chart from yesterday, you will see that the original re-entry order would have been higher, but since the MAs traveled lower, the entry was possible lower, after a few hours passed. It's important I think that the EA take into account the position of the signal MA (33) and enter once price hits it, anywhere that might be, as opposed to placing an order immediately at the level of the 33EMA at the moment of the delayed signal. Because the order may never get filled that way, or if it does it may be at a weird, very high level where we would no longer be interested to take it. Diamond: thanks for your contribution. I will not alter the setup or enter other filters for now, because it would be the beginning of a whole new learning curve for me But in time, once we get this system running on EA with optimal settings and make a minimum of 500pips monthly (same as I usually make trading manually) I'll be more than willing to try out refinements like the one you proposed. I am currently trying out the EA on all pairs, and take notes. We need to make adjustments &amp;add some filters, but it's a very good start. Also, I am yet to see a delayed entry (these are very good, actually, as they happen within strong moves, in the direction of the move, at a good enough level). I will post all observations in one single post, once done, so as not to spam the thread.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
since several guys asked, I give one more example of a perfect delayed entry from yesterday (didn't take it myself, but the EA would have caught it). Of course, not all will work like this: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #52 ---
GA from yesterday and today one more entry

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yes you are right, I used candles 1 and 0 (actual one) for the cross. I will change it to use candles 2 and 1 to ensure we get the signal when candle 1 is closed. For the TP, yep we could combine a fixed TP and a close at opposite signal option, and use both together or one only. That would be interesting to backtest and see which combination has the best performance. I will add that too.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Could you annotate a chart showing that? I'm not sure to understand what you mean by reconfirmation signals and first signals... Thanks

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hey Mickey, Following your system I am overflowed for the amount of signals I see today. Could you post the list of pairs you use to watch? Another doubt. In case you take a trade and the other side of the channel it's just, let's say, 18pips, do you fix there the SL or do you still fix a 40 pips SL? thank you Toni

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This UsdChf signal happened 15 minutes ago.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks Mickey for taking the time in addressing my need. Much appreciated...

--- 帖子 #58 ---
There are no words to describe my gratitude Mickey! Your system is another evidence of theory that everything genial is simple! :-) I personally can see 4 clear signals to enter on the chart USDJPY. I missed second signal, so entered after third one (shown on screenshot). Decided to close it manually because of possible pull-back movement, resistance level ahead + ADR was about 100% already.. greed is healthy but it has ability to kill))) Result for today +50pips (R/R = 1/2.5) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Where can we find a good programmer for this? I'm looking the charts and it looks good!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Excellent question. No hard stop is ever perfect... Actually, if you can trade the system manually, it's ideal to reduce the stop if you can. If you can place a stop of, say, 35pips or 30pips, and still be safe (stop beyond the channel, maybe even above a swing high/low), then it's fine, you should do it. The most important thing is to never let the stop exceed 50pips. Forexdaist - you can use any pair you want, but not all will perform equally well, and it's possible the pair you choose to have a bad period right when you start. Patience is needed, as always in trading. I like the majors because i have a smaller spread on them, i usually don't like the CAD pairs because they make frequent sudden large moves against the trend - but I've seen cad pairs giving hundreds of pips on the system... so you never know, it's all about personal preference and patience. This is why i want to automate and spread over many pairs, to be able to compensate losses between pairs and benefit from more rallies. For starters, I'd choose a pair I know at first, and go from there. Fotolia: you illustrate very well my approach, of keeping in mind your own criteria when you trade, and take profit when you have it, if the profits are reasonable and if the charts are showing you signs of trend exhaustion. 50pips with a risk of 40 is still not bad, and besides you can always go back in at the next pullback to the channel Damiend: thanks for your patience and effort in helping us all with the EA. First signal: a signal that changes the direction of the trend, the first BUY signal after a SELL or a series of SELL signals, or the first SELL signal after a BUY or a series of BUY signals. Reconfirmation : a signal of the same kind as the previous one: BUY when the previous signal was also BUY, or SELL if the previous signal was a SELL. Would be great if the EA could have 2 options: 1) to only enter ONE position, on the First signal, and then ignore the next signals of the same kind (so as not to have a too large exposure in that trend), or 2) enter ALL SIGNALS, as they come, regardless of whether there is an open trade in the same direction or not. Hope this clarifies this issue.

actually, from what i see in the chart you posted, nr2 is not a signal - the signal line just goes into the channel... it doesn't come out again, to reconfirm.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thank you for great system and explanations Now I'm sure we are on the same page.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Guys, Attached is the new EA version 1.1, the new features are: TakeProfitAtOppositeSignal parameter : enable it to take profit at opposite signal. It can work : with the hard TP: in this case the first to be triggered will take profit without the hard TP (set it to 0) : in this case, take profit will occur at opposite signals only MaxOpenedTrades parameter : by default it is =1 and it means the EA will take one trade/signal at a time by default. You can increase it to allow more opened trade and such take more signals. It can be a reconfirmation signal or an opposite. AdditionalLotSize parameter : if you allow more than one trade, all additional trades will use this lot size. UseTradingTimes parameter : if enabled, the EA will trade between TradingBrokerStartTime (GMT) and TradingBrokerEndTime (GMT) only. In this case, please setup your broker gmt time in BrokerGMT. Signals are now valid on candle close only to avoid too much false signals. Don't hesitate to test it and send us your feedbacks Please don't use this EA on live account, it's not enough tested yet.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Damian, by the looks of it you included all that's been discussed, thank you! I will immediately start testing it across all pairs, to see how it behaves &amp; get back to you guys with feedback when I have it. Looking forward to your suggestions or comments, if any. A question: did you manage to implement the "delayed entry" concept? What is the rule you used, to determine if a signal should NOT be taken immediately by the EA, but use a delayed entry instead? Is it a pending order? P.S. the EA set on all pairs gave an overall 200pips maximum profit today (in equity, all pairs combined) I think it's not bad, given the fact that we had a few losses too, and about 50pips were lost in the spreads used to open so many pairs... Looks like we're on the right track!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I tried creating an EA based on MickeyMar concept......hope it helps. see attached cheers

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Mickey, Yes good result, we are on the right track I have backtested it on GU and the result looks good but I will take some time to test more than that. I noticed that the takeProfit when opposite signal alone is not the best option, as you said it's not as efficient as a hard TP most of the time. But let's test more and we will see. The delayed entry system is implemented since the first version, and is enabled by default with UseDelayedEntries=true input param. It can be turned off to make some tests and compare the results with and without it if needed It is not using a pending order because when you get the signal, you don't know what will be the level/price to place the pending order yet. Instead of that, the EA memorizes the sell and buy signals and wait for the price to touch the 33EMA to enter at market. Every time there is a new sell or buy signal to delay, it will overwrite the previous one. I hope I'm clear enough, else don't hesitate to tell me.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
the settings can be tweaked to improve it..play with them.......used hidden trailing stop and stoploss to hide from broker

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks for your effort and for Ea ... but regarding delay entries is this entry correct? (the 0.51lot one)...I've enabled it but if understand right we had to wait price touch 33 EMA... or not? Thnaks Regards https://i.gyazo.com/cb4f68da4a62036a...a28323c1a0.png

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Cescof, Your delayed entry is not correct, you must wait for the price to touch the 33ema. Did you place this order manually or is it from the EA?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Off course I've posted it cause it was Ea related.... I'll go to check for next orders... And of course I will check new updates... but that's order was wrong.. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ah I can see that I forgot to explain how the current condition for the EA to delay an entry works. An entry is delayed if the SL would have been below the Channel high for a Sell, or above the Channel low for a buy. In others words, if the SL is not on the other side of the Channel, the entry is delayed because it's not secure enough.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Not sure it's wrong, sorry. See my previous post. If the SL was set above the channel, the entry is correct.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Crystal clear Damian, all I wanted to know was how you implemented the rule into the EA. I got your answer, it's perfect the way you did it. Let's see how it goes, the EA is on now, I will watch the equity curve on the basket of pairs. Cheers and thanks again!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
That's exactly the rule I used, so it's correct from my side. I was thinking of making that rule "10pips beyond the channel", to be even more sure, but I guess the difference is negligeable. We will still get stopped out many times, the important thing is to keep the good trades going... and going... I still haven't seen any delayed entry, but there will be this end of week, for sure. The EA now opens trades after the candle close, so no more trades taken before the signal is printed. Good job Damian. THanks also Elsar, for your EA - I will see if I can test it in parallel. Any extra feature, compared to Damian's work?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
hello thanks god ea can you add trading hours

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi MickeyMar, Thank you for the nice system. Hope, we can make some green pips with this system. Roy

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Could you give some explanations about the parameters, please. Some are self explanatory like the MA settings. But other like basketprofit, newstop need some explanation for me. thanks in advance Jan

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi damiend, Thanks a lot for your latest version of the Channel MA EA. In my chart I have set the trading time from 05:00 GMT to 18:00 GMT (broker time). But now I see that that the EA started trading from 22:00 GMT (broker time). Is it because of some bug in the EA? Is there any possibility of converting this EA in to an ' one chart basket trading EA' ? Thanks in advance. Roy

--- 帖子 #79 ---
hi Mickey, please correct me if i got you wrong just want to get the difference between Delayed Entry and Reconfirmation Signal. 1) Delayed Entry =&gt; Crossover happened on extreme volatility.We do not enter at the end of push at first crossover, we wait for a pull-back when price touches again the signal 33EMA. Then we enter. At your example was there a Delayed Entry? (file attached below) 2) Reconfirmation Signal =&gt; What this signal is? and when it is formed for us? Is it a swing point on red signal line that touches 55EMA and points out in the direction of first signal? 3) Why it is not a Reconfirmation Signal at this example? Becausered line doesn’t touch the upper blue line? Many thanks in advance Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Well for me delayed entry is same as pullback, the price moves strongly with the trend, goes back close to ma's and you enter on pullback.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
srcs76, would be ok if i ask you to share yun atr/adr indi present on your tf... thank's in advance.. MickeyMar, nice strategy yu have here very profitable but have to be patience for more profitable position... goodluck!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
How do you trade it for it to be profitable ? Thank You. Best regards

--- 帖子 #83 ---
hi jgadefelth, once the 33ema cross the band on high volatile status, you have to wait for pullback/retrace where candle touch the 33ema/55ema band most likely the cross happen with very high push/pull or with the news event... don't jump yet on the smoking gun instead wait for better position during pullback/retrace...

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hy... Ea vers 1.1 ... why i'dont have any entries here? Is this the case in which Ea waiting for pullbcak? Thanks Regards https://i.gyazo.com/e17ba1bde721282a...e6c4f34228.png

--- 帖子 #85 ---
We don't see the prices on your screenshot so I can't tell you for sure... But you don't have an entry here because the price is too far from the channel. See my picture, the EA tried to open a SELL position in "1" but the stop loss would have been in "2" (the other side of the channel), but it didn't open it because the distance is more than X pips, X being your StopLoss value configured in EA input parameters. NB : The vertical lines drawn by the EA are showing the delayed entries for debug purpose.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Yes we could try that later, but I agree with you, I'm pretty sure the difference will be negligeable. From my first backtests on GU, I even feel like a 30 pips SL would produce better results than 40 pips but I will make more tests.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Really thanks for answer.. and great Ea... Maybe if you can/want could be useful add a kind of trailing stop manager... Regards

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi RoyPK, Thanks for your feedback. Is your broker at GMT+0 time? If so, did you set the BrokerGMT input parameter to 0 ? (It is 3 by default) About the multipair EA on one chart, it is not my primary objective because: It would not be backtestable, or very difficult It is more flexible to add the EA to each chart if we want to set different parameters by pair (TP, SL, trading time...). All in one EA would produce a huge list of param The code will be much more complicated to manage multipairs and I don't have enough time to do it currently But still I plan to add a global daily/weelky/monthly pips target. With all the EA instances having the same target, it would stop to trade when reached. Of course I could reconsider a multipair EA when the current monopair one will be fully tested and working.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
May i try toi use this Ea with in a renko chart? Thanks Regards

Yes thank you. What pairs do ts use and i dont think i see how he take profits if we dont take the small 40 pips ? Best regards

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes I didn't test it but it should work with renko and all others candle types.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thanks for this cool system. I have just took a sell on GBPUSD delayed entry. I saw in backtests that it is more reliable when it also retrace to 50% fibo. Let's see Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #95 ---
For discussion; I would suggest that once price moves to the opposite side of channel, there is a good chance that a change in momentum has taken place. I generally keep my Stops within 5 or 6 pips outside of channel. The only variation could be if price is moving out of a long period of consolidation. In many cases, my stops would be 30-35, following these guidelines. Just my thoughts, not trying to alter basic set up.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Fotolia: I think you should see the rules again, but in any case I'll try to explain again: There are 2 ways to enter: immediately (when a crossover happens and the 50pips maximum SL is not on the same side of the channel) or delayed (when the crossover happens after or during a very large move, and we can't put our maximum 50pips stop on the other side of the channel). In this second case, the EA is simply waiting for price to hit the 33EMA (signal MA) and enters when price touches it. On the EA, you will see it as a vertical dotted line, which means the next time prices touches the 33EMA, the order will be executed. Now: ALL THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIRST SIGNAL AND RECONFIRMATION SIGNAL. Both the first signal (which changes the direction, as I posted in a previous post) and the reconfirmation (happening when the signal MA goes inside the channel and back out) can be immediate OR delayed. So, we have: 1a. First signal immediate 1b. First signal delayed 2a. Reconfirmation signal immediate 2b Reconfirmation signal delayed In your picture: 1) is nothing, no signal. I don't think it's a delayed entry, because the previous signal appears quite close to the channel, so it would have been executed immediately, with no delay. 3) is nothing, no signal 2) it's a reconfirmation signal. signal line goes (very little, but it goes) into the channel, then comes back up to cross above the channel. Hope this helps. I really can't explain it better Use the EA in testing, visualization mode, to see how the signals are executed - it will give you an understanding of how the system works, in concept. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Is your manual entry? Below same charts but with Ea entry... delayed condition not true but your manual order is better in this case.. I will try to take two charts with different magic and with delayed option true and false .... Regards https://i.gyazo.com/d41d05312089cec7...595668fa8c.png

I am completely on the same page with Damian here. the Daily/weekly/monthly pips target would be a great idea. For instance, last night the NZD pairs produced HUGE profits on the system. I accidentally closed my pc again when I went to sleep... so I only have one nzd pair open now with +130pips. But the results were MASSIVE. Honestly, I think these times should be used in order to BANK PROFITS. I really don't care if the pairs could have gone further, if I can make 1000pips on all pairs in ONE DAY, regardless HOW, I would just take them and go, end of story. And this exact thing happened LAST NIGHT, on GBPNZD, EURNZD, NZDJPY, and NZDCHF pairs combined. I am aware that the system, in testing, will not always be profitable. USDJPY for instance, my best pair so far, only made 700pips in testing, for the whole year. But I am not planning to trade the EA for weeks without checking. The purpose of the EA for me is to help when I am sleeping and not able to manage trades, when Im away for 6-12 hours, stuff like that. I will never abandon my live trades completely, and have a profit of 1000pips dissapear from my platform Im sure you guys get the point. We are traders at the end of the day, and profits are about BANKING MONEY. I don't care if the EA in testing on the NZD pairs is not profitable. This is the reason why I want to trade the EA as a basket. Damian is right, it's too complicated at this point. But Damian, if you could add a "close when equity reaches + x%, it would be great. Last night I literally WATCHED the EA taking all the trades from 2017 it was a lovely movie for me anyway... it occurred to me that the entries are VERY GOOD, and so is the trade protection setting. But the take profit side sucks... Which is why I want to manage that manually, until a better filter than fixed TP or close on opposing signal is found. So Damian, here's an idea that could really improve our profit taking greatly: what about having an option to CLOSE TRADE IF PRICE CLOSES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL? You get my point? This will take out many trades, but I don't mind, because if we trade reconfirmations then the EA will open again the trade if price goes back into the trend... so we will not lose much. But we could gain hundreds of pips by not letting the stops be hit... Let's try it? So, these 2 things are for me the only ones left for a GOOD EA: 1) option to close all if unrealized P/L hits X% of account balance. 2) option to close trade if price closes on the other side of the channel (for a long, if price closes below the 55EMA applied to low / for a short, if price closes above the 55EMA applied to high). I'd prefer this to a trailing stop (I hate trailing stops in general). Closing beyond the channel, from the "movie" I saw last night... is usually a sign that the signal's strength is gone, and there's no point in continuing to stay in, especially since there's a good chance if we are wrong and exit too early, the EA will get us back in at the next reconfirmation. Right now, missing many trades last night, my demo account with EA put on ALL PAIRS (some 25) is showing a 200pips NET profit (down from 300pips some 1hr ago). It's really exceeding my expectations. One more thing, and sorry for the long messages: I don't use optimizations, and I never used backtesting for this strategy. The system was designed with MARKET LOGIC behind, and meant to MAKE SENSE IN ANY MARKET, IN ANY VOLATILITY. I was happy to see that it generates profits on paper, too, just running the EA. But believe me, using a minimal discretion and some sound money management to close/alter the EA manually, the results could be X10 better than using the EA blindly. Sorry if i don't answer ALL messages, sometimes the questions are already in the previous posts &amp; between my trading and my life there isn't much time to answer. But I read all and I thank you all for participating and helping improve this system and making it automated.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
first of all, thanks for the strategy. Second thanks for the expert. I just found this and am now trying to setup with 28 charts, then leave it for 1 week to get more info. Question can the EA be modified so that each chart/instance of the expert gets its own magicnumber assigned? would it also be possible to change the comment to external variable

--- 帖子 #100 ---
You can modify the magic number for each chart, when you put the EA on. It's editable.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I hadn't seen this post - I suggested the same thing to Damian, a setting that would allow taking profits if price closes on the opposite side of the channel If 2 people see the same thing... must be right Yea, reducing stops is good in the long run, especially when you have time to enter manually and place them better than the EA. The EA is a TOOL, it's not meant to beat a trader's good judgment or technical/fundamental outlook, and it also has no idea when there's news... Good job, and thanks for the input!

Is everyone who is running the EA using M15 charts with standard default inputs?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's the situation now on my platform. Unfortunately, a valid signal was missed today on my platform, I don't know if it's an error on my side or some EA issue: GBPCHF should have taken a delayed entry around 1.2871, but this trade was never opened. I think chances are it was my error (maybe i closed the platform and didn't realize it, or maybe I had that chart on another timeframe than M15 at the time?). Damian: if the chart is moved on, say, another Timeframe when a signal is happening, it will not be taken? I don't necessarily mean we should change it, I just want to know. Today, with all the movements, the equity kept steady between +100pips and +300pips on all pairs. The best thing for me is that there was no drawdown and that equity was steady, which is by far what I value most. If we manage to keep the EA running on basket of pairs with no serious DD, sooner or later a big move with the trend will give us many many pips. Starting Monday I will put the EA on a basket of pairs on a small live account. Time to get some hands-on experience Right now for instance, I would manually close some trades: the NZD pairs traveled a long way, and it's the end of the US session, it's likely some serious profit taking will occur. Of course, the new updated EA will close anyway when price goes on the other side of the channel, but I'd manually take my profits NOW on these pairs, if I had them. On demo I will just keep all open, im watching the equity curve carefully. As soon as Damian is done with the last updates, I'll be jumping in - waiting for this moment for a long time

Hi Diamond, Honestly I don't follow, I have no idea what AMA is, and in general what the above has to do with the system we're discussing in this thread. This sounds more like a scalping strategy Please, don't take it the wrong way, but if what you are trading is not directly related to the MA channel system let's discuss it in a more general thread? I imagine there are other traders who want to trade the system, and the offtopics tend to get them off-track. Thanks!

All pairs Joseph, since I'm still testing the EA. Manually I traded EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD. When I start trading live i will probably reduce it to about 10, so as not to expose too much from the start.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
@cescof Yes, it was a manual entry and closed at +11 pips as i had to go away from computer. I don't like trades to be managed by an ea. And i also prefer to take some entries at 50% fibo when price has retraced into the channel. It might be interesting if this could be added in EA as options. Best regards, A

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hy.. last night many orders was opened by Ea ... some closed by tp and other by sl. I've chose to take 2 charts for each pair and put Ea with different setting in delayed order true and false to see the difference. In the screenshot below you can see USD/JPY chart one with delayed set to true with order delayed rightly and the other one with same signal but no order entry... What's wrong? I really like this system but as i said before i think great improvement could be trailing and ADR %stop. Every pair is different and also ema channel is different so i think tht's this kind of order management coudl be really useful.. https://i.gyazo.com/fd228c4955040d8c...57625619bb.png https://i.gyazo.com/16525c9c21c63a76...a77123651b.png Best regards

Hi MM, have to give you the credit for this sys, im trading similar sys for living for abt 2 years, but your helps me to void choppy market very well, i generally use higher time frame to guide my trading from 4H to 15 min, now im more confident with combination with your sys, once again Thanks to you. just a brief abt my sys, i use 60 EMA and 34 EMA ,both EMA should be align from 4h to 15 min, and must close above or below daily opening, This way i stay with the trend, not toconfuse everyone with my sys,ill just focus here with your sys, your method is a great way to avoid ranging market. Thanks again for you contribution.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yes that's the way I coded it. If UseDelayedEntries is disabled, the EA won't take these kind of setups where SL is not at the opposite side of the channel, it would be too risky.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
On your MT4 software, click on file &gt; open data folder. In this folder, copy the EA file in MQL4 &gt; Experts folder. And restart your MT4. Or search in Google for "metatrader 4 install EA" to know more.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Nice system and nice way to control chop somehow. Thanks for sharing, MickeyMar and thanks damiend for the EA.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Ok thanks i tought the opposite... delayed entry as a sort of protection and not delayed entry in any case.... maybe could be better or not?? In a sense that if you want be more conservative you can use delayed but if you wanna try to catch entire trend you can chose to enter even if hig volatility... and use sl This my 2 cents Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Guys, this indicator should indicate the "banking levels" or, in order to understand each other, important levels: levels where the price made spikes in the past or important reversions... in the inputs you can choice the amount of days to analize, max 10. I suggest you 6. When you'll load this, you' ll see that sometimes these levels forms a "cage", when this cage it's broken (before that the price could go up and down blocked in this cage or retrace ecc), the price goes straight to the next higher or lower level: So when there is space between these levels, it's a good thing, it's "tradable space" and the price seems like it's free to move strong. I have noticed that these levels are good targets: instead of taking only 40 pips each trade, we could set targets where this level is, and achieve for example 60, 70 pips or much. Only my thoughts. Maybe i'm wrong, load it and give it a look please.

Hi damiend. Your EA looks nice. Can I suggest to add a trailing stop after BE option to it? I would like to try it on shorter TFs and I have the impression that trailing would give nicer results. Thank you

i dont think its for you, i guess MM got confuse, its supposed to be for Elsar.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
how about exit condition: dont close while candle touching the standard BB, but close first time candle does not touch either wait for new signal or ... optional: if next candle breaks current candle low re enter short ... it it breaks the high open long ... just a suggestion ... nice work going on here!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Posted for Elsar. AMA just opened 90 trades in one minute. Some are 0.01, Most are 0.1. All trades opened on candle following touch, and close, below upper band. Chicago Rob. My Margin showed a negative balance on this demo acct. All trades closed out in profit between 0.02 pips, &amp; 2.65 pips.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Sorry Mickey if you feel i was trying to hijack the thread but that is not the case.I was trying to help implement your wonderful strategy . it follows the same principle as you suggested. the only difference was my attempt to deal with the issue of fixed take profit and stops so as to maximize profit. if you take a look you will observe that instead lets say 0.1 mini lot, you can set it to buy 10 micro lots (0.1)and as trend move in your favour, trades are closed partially so that we can extract all possible profits. trades are also closed when candle close above or below opposite channel. I forgot to add the number of lots per trade that was why it appeared to open so many trades

--- 帖子 #147 ---
sorry forgot to limit trades to open. see modified. you can control number of trades with the max open trade

Because there are news. Be careful, you've been lucky (Me too). I forgot to watch the economic calendar; On CAD/CHF in a good entry this would be a huge loss. Never forgot to control economic calendar guys! Back to the basics, lol

++++++++++++++++++++++ Generally good advice. However in one of MM's posts, he responded to a question regarding news, and said that for some news, changing trade status may not be needed. Cad pairs are a different story. MM also mentioned (early on) that he didn't usually trade Cad pairs due to their affinity toward powerful, and erratic moves. If I got any of this wrong, I apologize.

Diamond, please, don't take it the wrong way - I just didn't understand what it was all about, because I could only test the EA made by Damiend, and the trades you showed in the picture seemed all like scalps. And the system I presented doesn't scalp, that's all... But please, if you think it's relevant for us all go ahead and share, we all have a voice here, without you guys this thread wouldn't exist. You didn't do anything "wrong".

No problem Bandit.

Hi Rob, PM me as there is a solution which I use ( I am in same situation )

--- 帖子 #160 ---
thanks for the reply, every time i click on the ea to down load it from here, it simply opens up in notepad and I cannot save it in any other format apart from a text file, is it possible to have it in the MQ4 format as this downloads without any issues?

AU reached TP, +30 pips. EU is going nice. TP is 40 pips. While see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #162 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++ Sounds like you're on a Mac. If so, simply close .txt file. Then find the file (probably in your downloads folder), single click on file name, to highlight (it should give title, followed by '.mq4.txt' [filename.mq4.txt] ) then delete .txt from name. Of course you can reverse this procedure to access the code, in case you want to look at it, or change it.

hi guys can you help me to understand the rules and MM in this example according to rules 1 signal accure price was 30 pips away from channel pretty far and fixed stop got hit, also delayed enter would SL 2nd signal if you consider fixed TP 40 didn't quit reach it 3rd signal also about 30 pips far from channel

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Actually, as mentioned before, I like the news Because with this system there is no HUGE loss, our damage is limited at 50pips or, like some of you suggested, even less. While the profits are not capped... CADJPY closed at break even, while USDCAD now has +112pips. Thanks to the news on my test with all pairs, I missed some huge moves on gbpaud and gbpnzd due to the "delayed entry" setup - this time the market went straight up, without retesting the 33ema. I still believe in the delayed setup, over time my best manual entries were on such setups, and I know it's good. But I'd still like to be able to have an "open trade now" option on the EA, so if I decide to go in late, not to take the trade manually but activate this option, so that the EA can manage it further. I had 2 trades that were not taken by the EA, surprisingly - NZDUSD and NZDJPY last night. Maybe the spread at the time was larger than 6 (what I have set up)? What do you think Damien? I tried it in strategy tester, and it opened just fine.. what could it be? OK, here's 3 extra improvements that I hope we can make to the EA on the next release (I think we're pretty close to a stable version now). So Damien, when you have time.... 1) An "open trade now" setting , which, once ticked, would open a trade immediately, at the market price, on the current active signal direction, with default SL/TP as per the other settings, without waiting. I want to use this when I want to trade a setup manually, but I still want the EA to manage it further (exit, stop moved to Break even after 25pips, etc.). 2) A frequency filter for the reconfirmation signals - I think this is important. let me explain: sometimes the signal MA and the channel MA are almost overlapping, and if price spikes a few times, the signal EA can actually make several crossovers in a very short time, resulting in unnecessary, excessive exposure. This is what happened last night on AUDCHF (see picture below, entries are marked by the EA). Solution: a filter (customizable, if possible) that would prevent any trades on the same pair to be open at less than, say, 20 pips distance of each other. This will ensure no repeated exposure will take place on the exact same signal, like last night. 3) A Trailing stop option (this is for the other guys, i personally will probably never use it, but I understand why traders would want it) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The EA works fine for me so far, can't wait for the new release so I can start trading live It's very clear that some discretion must be used in order to get maximum benefit - closing at the end of a session, partially closing in profit pairs with 2-3 entries, adjusting SL or taking profit right before big news (not closing the trades, but adjusting SL or updating the TP), stuff like this. The EA on all pairs, taking many many losses since yesterday, missing the CAD signals, taking 3 erroneous trades on audchf (see above) still managed to keep a steady equity curve and be little in negative. I am satisfied, and quite confident that after the new release (with earlier profit taking) the EA will start to give its real value. Thanks again guys for all your inputs and feedback, and thanks to the programmers for the indicator and continuous EA support!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanx for EA. I have a bug in setting sl tp for orders. For some pairs, they are set as in the settings, and for the other x10. I put sl 50 pips in settings. Attached Image Sometimes it is exhibited 50 sometimes 500. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Beethoven, you got it right - CADJPY was not exactly a symphony the last few signals: first a loss (-40), then a trade closed at breakeven (right before the fall) and now a +6pips open trade. CADCHF, AUDCAD and AUDCHF are responsible for about 400pips losses in the last 2 days. I never even tested the system on these pairs, so it's all new for me, too but 3 of these losses (about 120pips) were simply repeated signals, taken by the EA at about the same levels - this will never happen in live trading for me (I already posted this problem to Damien, I'm sure there's a fix) Sometimes it's even worse... I've seen it, it happens, so I just take it as being part of the game. Even my favorite, USDJPY, had a moment early this year when it made some 3-4 losses in a row. IT HAPPENS... This is exactly why I want to trade more pairs and use some common sense discretion from time to time, so as to be able to compensate for these inevitable losses with some nice big profits, and still be left with many pips to spare

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Great thanks for the extensive tests, it helps a lot because unfortunately I don't have a lot of time these days so it's difficult to do the coding + the tests. Ok for the 3 new features, I can add that to your shopping cart It sounds good, I will do that asap next week. Honestly I think I won't use the trailing stop too because I tested this on a lot of EAs and it didn't improve the overall results so I don't have a lot of faith in this. But I will add it because it's requested by a lot of people there. For your trades not opened in NZDUSD and NZDJPY, I guess the spread was too high during the night yep. If you still have the logs, could you check in your terminal log tab? When a trade is opened, I log a line with the spread.

Don't worry Damien, you do the coding, we do the testing and reporting

--- 帖子 #170 ---
As I get more of feel for this method, I'm of a mind to stay mostly with the mainstream pairs. Spread is one good reason. I'm also not convinced that Gbp pairs play well either. I guess that would leave; EU, AU, NU, UCad (maybe), UChf, UJ, AJ, ChfJpy, EJ. I might reconsider as testing continues. I'm also considering not trading Friday. The last trading day of the month is also a candidate for exclusion. But I'm definitely looking forward to getting more and more data, as time rolls on.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Sorry Elsar, it's my bad - didn't realize you guys were discussing scaling out options. I could not test the other EA, unfortunately, as I'm still trying to get a good grip on Damiend's work. This weekend I'll have a look, since it's clear that what we need to perfect is not the entry, the stop or the initial trade management, but the take profit. I personally don't use bollinger bands or other indicators, i prefer to keep it simple and next week when I start live trading the EA I will close based on price patterns, timing and/or key S/R levels, the way I've always done. The old classics still work But I will definitely do this fine tuning, and let the EA do just the "dirty work". Thanks for trying out options and sharing them, we're all here to learn, grow and.... make pips! cheers!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
What is the obvious way to trade it? Maybe you mean to enter when the channel it's broken? But this generate a lot of false signals... (maybe i'm totally off-road) Why are you saying to trade without stop loss? For me trading without SL it's a crazy idea. I don't think the idea behind it is a garbage, because Mickey have traded it 4 years, not 4 months. Who would trade garbage 4 years loosing money...?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Mickey and traders here, I've been testing the EA since two days. I did it with a little discretion closing some trades. I've just closed everything. Results are great, even today friday that usually don't work very well. Here the numbers: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Keep on with the thread. I'm sure we can refine the EA to make it better. I neither think I will use any trailing option. The frecuency filter idea is good. Next week more test! thanks you TONI

Hi all, I'm following this thread with interest. Congratulations to mickeymar about this system. For Renko's fans, here is a possibilty to trade the system but you need to change the EMA. I tried EMA 17 for high and low and 13 for signal. Of course, the number of winning pips is increased.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi alicia You can easily change the settings in the EA.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Please what is the Renko size?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
3 pips but you can choose You delete the files in Tools &gt; Global Variables, take a M1 chart ans install the EA with the chosen size. In Chart offline, you choose M2.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi MickeyMar: How does the EA know to trade only in the M15? When I load it into the M15 time chart it shows in all time frames. This is the first EA I've tried, so it's quite a learning curve for me and I want to get it right the first time. Hoping to test it starting Monday. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
It's working too in daily 937 pips on EU....trade in progress but reversal possibility @damiend Could you check your code ? I wanted to do a backtest in daily from may 2017 to now with Take Profit at Opposite Signal the EA took the trade correctly on may 5 but with only 5 pips profit ?????? ....no in agrement with the chart

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Regarding your question in the image: I confirm that if UseTradingTimes is false, you don't have to worry about start and end time. Thanks for your tests!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
It doesn't know. There's no such restriction in the EA, it can trade on any chart it is attached to. It means if you attach the EA to a M15 timeframe chart, it will use M15. If you attach it to a D1 chart, it will use D1, and so on. But if you test several timeframes for the same pair, I advise you to set a different EAMagicNumber in the settings for each timeframe.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hmm I guess you are using the default BreakEven settings, aren't you? Because with default values BreakevenAfter=25 and BreakevenValue=5, it will set SL at 5 pips when it goes 25 pips in your favor. You can disable BreakEven by setting BreakevenAfter=0, or use highers values if you don't want to be stopped by a retracement.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
DamienD, sorry to be a pain in the ass... but could you also add a simple ON/OFF button to the EA? It would be useful to simply turn off a certain pair if the situation in the market requires it, without having to remove the EA from the chart and lose the personalized settings... of course they could be saved, but if it's not too much trouble, I could use this simple setting (ideally placed first in the list). Thanks man... Have a good weekend!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thx damiend it's correct now but why is it impossible to get a good modeling quality in the backtest ?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I just picked this quote to post... Ive never even loaded an EA except RonZ for auto TP. Anyway... I’ve placed a -5 shift of the 33, this forces the cross of the 55ema sooner at least visually, will this “visual” representation be present in the trade itself, of will it still only enter upon the default parameters? as I’m new to this, you guys may need to make Thisbe slight input change to understand what I’m talking about... please reply...

I have been comparing this system with others here and i have come up with a perfect combination for those who are interested in getting very early signals, just look at the blue and magenta arrows as compared to the original ones i posted above and make your judgment. I compared with paradox system and coded Romar_MA_cross.ex4 that produces the blue and magenta arrows (you have to also download the included Paradox_ROMAR.ex4 for it to work). I hope I'm not distracting you from an already working system but i believe this discovery makes it even more profitable.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
55 EMA high 55 EMA close 55 EMA low 33 EMA close Damiend can you please add the option for the EA to use the 55 EMA set to close as an stop loss? If long only close the trade if price is below the 55 EMA set to close. thanks

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thanks for sharing bro

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Actually Sidric... no offense, but for me this is a bit distracting. As far as I see this indicator has no connection to the original strategy. Bringing other systems and indicators into what we have is taking us way too far from our main topic, and in my opinion it's complicating things for those just starting to use the system. I put the romar arrows you mentioned on a chart, out of curiosity. 13.10 at 18:45 and 18.10 at 3.30 on EURUSD were actually false signals on these arrows, filtered out perfectly well by the original channel MA system . Yes, the entries given by these arrows are apparently earlier, but what about FALSE ENTRIES? The system's main objective and logic is exactly to filter as much as possible the inevitable MA noise and false signals... The channel idea is the main focus of this thread, and I'd like to keep it that way, please. If the Romar indicator or others have their own threads... please share all that there... There are so many MAs, there are many MA systems, none is perfect and believe me: no MA combination is "THE BEST" . Many times "better" is the enemy of "good". I never said this system is the best, but it is working and i think it's in our best common interest to focus on what was found in real trading to be working. Of course improvements are welcome, but I think these must come from a lot of market experience , not just a quick look at one chart. If we keep changing the rules, we will never master the game as it is, so we can make real money from the system. Which is why we're all here, I think Please please please don't take this personal , i'm not trying to silence or block anyone from openly sharing their ideas and experience - your input has been very useful and appreciated so far. Sidric: your indicator is the one I use now, thank you for your work, your enthusiasm and interventions! But please, let's STICK TO THIS SYSTEM here in the thread, so that our discussion and efforts can all point in the same direction Thanks in advance for your understanding!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
+++++++++++++++++++ Agreed. btw, this secretive romar MA is simply 8SMMA. The paradox thread, is the work of a madman, imho. Regarding the on/off switch for Damiend's EA, try changing the 33EMA to 55, set to close. No cross, no entry.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I was wondering what romar was. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. I've found out that it's actually 33 EMA crossing 36 SMM and i agree it shouldn't be here....... Before i came here i developed a headache after reading the first few pages of that thread lol.. On that note I'm requesting guys not to use it if you don't know what you are doing, it's for aggressive traders like me

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Please alicia, keep the original settings 40 pips SL / TP and 55,55 and 33 and follow the thread

Good idea. This button with Manual trade button add to the EA some discretion. Trader trade, EA is tool.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
In the original setting we have the option to close/take profit at oposite signal,if that is true we are not just taking 40 pis sl/tp right?

Damiend, not clear on Broker Time Item. I thought you explained it, but unable to locate post. My broker time is GMT +5. I normally view London open at 0900. Should I change broker time to read 0700?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
After extensive testing on EU, Beginning in December, last year. I found the original settings to be the best. 40 TP, 40 SL, BE @+25 moving SL to +5. This is trading only during a 9 hour window from 0900-1800. I think that GMT for this is 0700-1600. Not clear on that yet. While I was testing, I also compared other three MA methods for 55. They all suck, BiG TiME !

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hello everyone. EMAS only applies for movements in trend. And with a good filter, they generate good signals. Here an example of an EMA of 21, with a filter of one of 100

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I wonder if I can suggest one more option for the EA i.e. to discard the main signals and take only the delayed entries which are supposed to happen at a better price. Of course that could leave out good main signals but it could be a chanced to test the strategy in a different way by reducing the risk. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Thanks Diamonddbw, all sorted now and installed. I have loads of spare time on my hands and am going to start testing the Ea. I can spend up to 8 hours a day doing this if needed. Apart from the installation process which I have now completed, do I need to adjust anything to set it up? also will it place trades automatically on any pairs that I have charts for? thanks, Peter.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
+++++++++++++ You're welcome. EA works only on specific charts it's installed on (as far as I know). You may want to use different magic numbers on each chart with EA.

Hi cesar8, We look for the ATR indicator as it is on your chart. Can you give it to me ? regards,

--- 帖子 #207 ---
+++++++++++++++++++ GU Best results were using 60-65 TP &amp; 45 SL . Less, or more than 45 on GU had significantly worse results.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Diamonddbw, I am now testing and have noticed that the EA is not setting a SL or TP? do i need to set them in the properties section and if so to what values?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I should have said, it has now taken 6 trades and all are running.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes, this is a very good idea - or program the EA to enter trades in 2 contracts ( 1st contract so we catch the big move if there is a no delay - we have to accept smaller profits ) , (the second contract would be when price touch the signal line..) Both contract should have same TP / SL Needless to say high risk = high reward so this option for conservative traders. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I think this is already implemented with the option to enable/disable the entry on 33. I was suggesting exactly the opposite i.e. to take only the 33 entry. which is usually on a retracement, and disable the entry on 55.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
not sure if this has happened to anyone else, the EA just closed all of the trades in a single action, so no current trades open. any ideas what would have caused this? 1. internet working. 2. all pairs showing activity. 3. all pairs closed at the same time. 4. status is showing working its now back to opening trades again so i will see what happens again.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I am not familiar with the magic number? what is it and why would i want to change it? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi, i thanks to the author of this method. I am looking fot the last version of EA in mq4 format. SOmebody can post it? I am a developer so i think that i can contribute to the developing and optimization. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I did Extensive testing on EU. I did some on GU. Below are best results for each. Test period, December 2016 through present. EU is first picture. Please keep in mind that testing this way is not a very accurate representation. Real results may differ, however if you're leaving trading up to an EA, it's going to be a challenge.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Mate, look at the last a couple of posts. The guys are struggling. And the is the backtest BS reality?!? Can you imagine what will happen on real trading? - Slippages? - Fridays? - Some "unexpected" events? - Some even expected? - Not to forget about the news? - Dedicated server down? - VPS down? - Data center down? - MT4 server down? - Internet down? - Lost hard drive? - Lost back-up(s)? - Loving broker activities? - Even more loving Liquidity Providers activities? Hello?!? Houston, do you have a problem? Trade it, the OBVIOUS WAY, mate. The channel is a super cool idea. You screw it all up, with the stupid MA cross. The MA cross (the "signal") you are using will never going to work, unfortunately. And do not use SL. Flip instead.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
@MickeyMar, thank you for sharing your system. Nice and easy. @damiend, excellent EA. Keep the good work coming. And thanks to all other who shared other indicators too. Managing trades is always the tough part of a good system. Leaving money on the table is frustrating. I think the priority now is making sure that the EA trade according to the original rules, backtesting and live testing for enough period before Mickey and Damiend can give the green flag to go live. Maybe in the future Damiend can add more option for trade management, such as 1) using MA and/or ATR for TP targets and SL. 2) Add multi partial close option (by percentage of open trade, say TP1 20% @ 20pips, TP2 30% @ 40pips, TP3 30% @60pips and leave the remaining open , while moving the BE and trail stop on these TP levels). 3) option to place multi-order at same EP (I think multi-entry / multi-exit strategy is a good way to max locking profits). PS. I'm not sure how the EA handles open trades calculations if/when we switch from TF to another. Say I have open trade triggered by a signal from M15 chart, then I switch to H1, will this affect the open trade (my understanding that the EA takes signal from the TF it is attached to. In this case, maybe an option to select the signal TF in the EA will be the safest way to manage open trades forward) Anyway, good work here. I'll be following this thread with interest.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I think this can be done already by just going to the 'Common' tab and unselect the "allow live trading" option.

I'm not sure what your purpose is here, mate. With both your posts you have only managed to bash this system and have added nothing constructive. I would call it trolling so far, wouldn't you? I see you are an HI member but your behaviour doesn't seem to be in line with your rank, so either say something useful, beyond "trade it the obvious way", or stop posting. Fair enough (or not?)

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I agree....no negative posts here

--- 帖子 #223 ---
diamonddbw, The start and end dates on the EA are GMT times. This way everybody could use the same times to specify london open and close (for example). The GMT times for this session is from 7AM to 3PM, for the EA it would be 7:00 to 15:00. The only different parameter we will have between us is the BrokerGMT (5 for you). As a result, London open trades would start at 12AM with your broker (start GMT time: 7 + broker GMT shift: 5)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Guys, I had NO IDEA about other systems using this channel or the 55EMA. I don't claim any originality, I don't care about that, only about making this system automated and working profitably. This Dennis whatever system HAS ITS OWN THREAD. If you are interested in that, please just POST THERE and leave this system as it is for the people who want to trade it!! THANK YOU!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Maybe one more idea for the EA if possible... to add at least one or two more optional trading time windows, so we could avoid important news or slow sessions. I'm not sure if the suggestion to disable the autotrading temporarily is effective, as when enabling it again it could trigger trades that are not at the original price anymore (unless I'm wrong?).

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This looks very nice....which tp and sl strategy do you use?

There isn't any asshole at all. I think Mickey has been very clear in is explanation. The system and subject of this thread is pretty clear. Please repect it. Read all his posts and follow and help him. He shared with us a valuable estrategy, so let's help him to bring it on to a "catch-pips" machine. All toghether we can do it. let's work! toni

Hey Mickey Ty for sharing the sytem wiht us i tink i finaly found one sytem that seems to work for me. Can u pls share a little more if is not asking too much your money manegement, lot size that basic stuff that we all love to hear specialy if is from a true profitable trader

Mickey, I understand your point about the frequency filter. I have thought about a solution and I'm not sure that setting a pip distance is the best one, as we could probably want to add on a winning position on a reconfirmation signal (that could be some hours or days after the first signal) even when the pip difference between trade #1 and trade #2 is less than X pips. Instead could we use a minimum time between two valid signals parameter? I mean if the first signal appears at 09:00AM, and MinTimeBetween2Signals=2 hour, we would not take into account a new cross until 11:00AM. The parameter could be a number of bars too, and will apply for standards entries only because delayed entries could be pretty fast. What do you think of it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hi maximus I believe your trade is not in the rules. You need a cross below the lower channel line for a short trade.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Correct. I closed a sell trade manually on EURCAD because the 33 EMA was in the channel. Immediately the EA re-opens a sell trade ??????

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi. Here the indicator is requested.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hello, I asked a question yesterday that has not been answered... but. Today ive had the AMA by Elsar running, it took like 90 trades, all losing, all around .50 or less... None allowed a 40 pips Loss while none allowed a 50 point TP. ive also had the DD EA running since 5pm last night, it has not taken one trade, it is set on GU and EU 15m, both show a smiley face in the top right contener, but at the bottom left it reads Stopped, while Elsars EA read working... Please inform me if I’ve loaded it wrong.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
yes ur completly right ty for pointing that out i read again the sytem ^^

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Sometimes bad rules get good results

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I do not want to digress and talk about renko... Briefly I think SL 40 pips but no TP....take the profit at OppositeSignal

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Well, I don't know about your chart, but on my charts for EU and GU no trades because there are no signals. If you have the default template, do you see any arrows since market opened? No idea about your issues with the EA's.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
You're right Damien, what you say makes sense in the logic of the system. Yes, let's do like you propose, but let's make that setting editable, so each can adjust it to the number of candles they want. Thanks for your efforts!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
forget about AMA. has some bugs . Use the the DD-channel by Damien

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I had the same problems as Elsar, lots of loosing trades etc, where is the DD-channel system download? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thank you for the response, the DD still hasn’t traded. Not sure why.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
#post 63 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...7#post10403187 @Mickey, please add the latest DD EA to post 1 so that we can get the latest from there instead of searching the thread (maybe other useful indi's too such as the modified MA crossover).

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I've found using the strategy tester comes with lots of extra work. I began looking at results to eliminate NFP day trades, and found tester taking trades outside of time parameters. So if you choose to use MQ4's built in tester, it's important to do your own filtering.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Damien, the main problem is the standard entries, because only then we could have (because of MA overlapping temporarily) a few valid signals within a short period of time, like the one that happened on audchf last week. I just don't want the EA to open many trades when in fact it's pretty clear that the signal was only ONE, and the repeated entries are just a technical glitch. There is nothing in the logic of the system that would justify 3 entries instead of 1 in this case. I think you generally understood very well the system, and this request as well, so I leave it up to you to solve this the best and technically easiest way for you Guys, we have 2 EAs, one of DamienD and the other one by Elsar. I appreciate the work of both of them, but I only used Damien's EA so far, because it works just fine and I think once these last modifications are made the EA as I saw it will be ready. It doesn't mean I don't agree to Elsar's, I just didn't use it. Those of you who did - could you share your experience? does the EA do what it's supposed to do? Starting today I am trading the EA live on 6 pairs (will add more later), but I keep an eye on the trades every 2-3 hours and will close manually. I reached the conclusion that an EA (no matter how many settings it may have) will not be able to close positions automatically better than I can do it manually. The EA helps me A LOT, because it opens my trades for me, and leaves me with the easier task of managing them. So THANK YOU again. But I will want to manually intervene in my trades, for best results. I don't mind that at all. I am also continuing the test on all pairs on demo, with the objective of seeing how the system works if traded on a basket of pairs. I will ignore the trolls and the questions that can be answered easily by reading the previous posts - because of lack of time. But I will continue to update on my live trading with the EA, and what I found to work after using the EA, as well as answering relevant questions, if I can. I appreciate all inputs on your live trading the system, and in general all constructive talk about this strategy. Thanks again!

Its true---everybody learns everything the hard way good luck, regards

I started testing the system on Friday and so far happy with it...73 pips so far...I'm trading 7 pairs https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/77966...5-simplefx-ltd

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Done!

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Thanks MM and Damien D, downloaded and installed.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Not yet. Post 127

--- 帖子 #251 ---
yes but: Thanks for the contribution, elsar! So, let's focus our test on DD's EA only.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Beside the ones you mentioned in post 1 (UJ, EU and GU), what are the other 3 pairs?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
For now, I started with EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF. Not because they are necessarily "better", but because i know them better, and can manually adjust the trades with more accuracy. in a second phase I will probably introduce: EURJPY, GBPJPY, AUDJPY, NZDJPY, EURGBP, EURAUD, EURNZD, EURCAD, GBPCAD. But until then, I will get the hang of the EA with these pairs, while waiting for the next version of the EA.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Today result since market opened last night... 28 pairs default setting with 35sl and 2 order per pair... Not a good monday... https://i.gyazo.com/539278634607d466...15f6dd995e.png

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Cesar8 It does not appear on the chart once I've attached it. Do I have to do something ?+ Regards,

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I am trading live now , two arrows should tell us something , I took a short after the retest , mental SL above previous high... Correct me if I am wrong Thanks again to all contributors

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Guys it seems fit to create a discord channel for the thread. What do you guys think? and only wiht mickey on board ofc. Its easiaer to share stuff and we can even do share screen . Pls post your opinion. Ty.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
It breaks down like this. I’ll watch for more signs, but the program still reads stopped along the bottom, not sure why... that what I’m asking.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Sam, 2 arrows are not better than 1 , actually. it's not a sign the trend or signal is stronger - it's just that 2 crossovers happened instead of 1. My advice is to start with 1 trade open at the same time, which means you would take no re-entry signals unless the previous signal resulted in a profit or loss. MAX OPENED TRADES = 1 Yes, you can use manual variations of the system, if you failed to get the actual entry for any reason. But my advice is still to stick to the "first" signals, the ones that change direction, at first. Then add the reconfirmation signals once you start getting the "feel" of the strategy and you understand well how the system works. Like any other system, this one has its flows, and it's good to get to know them in demo, not live trading. Again - MY MAIN PURPOSE WAS TO TEST BASKET TRADING OF THIS SYSTEM, and see how I can adjust the regular settings of to basket trading. I'm still at the beginning of this task, demo trading a large basket and watching the equity. It's not bad so far, but it's still not in profit. It will take a few weeks to get some clear ideas and reach some conclusions.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I am very keen to hear from Mickey and to contribute and learn. The system is sound and worthwhile spending time to understand it. The EA is very useful and I want to understand as much as I can. If it would help to run a discord system then I am In.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi traders, One more day green pips. I've just closed the basket, 77 net pips. I started to switch on the EA just 30 minutes before London open. I made the basket with these 22 pairs: EU, GU, NU, AU, EJ, AJ, GJ, EA, EC, EG, GC, GA, AC, ACH, NC, CJ, CHJ, UC, UJ, UCH, CCH, CHJ. Have just one big loss, AUDCH. I closed some trades manually, USDCH and AUDUSD with small loss, AUDJPY-CHJPY-CADJPY in good profit. Here the numbers: Attached Image (click to enlarge) keep on with this amazing thread! thank you Mikey and Damien. TONI

--- 帖子 #262 ---
well done tony. great results. I have just downloaded and installed the EA, I am struggling with the operating times, I live in the USA which is 7 hours behind the UK. my broker GMT time is set to 3 and the opening time is set to 05.00 how do i work out if this is correct? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
OK, DD took a trade for me, although I’m thinking it’s an opposite scenario, the EA has at least taken a trade. Thank you, I’ll update with my minimal results...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Thanks , I got you MM. this pair was getting very low during US afternoon session of course to the extent I got out on break even as I do not want to be glued to the screen. It did move nicely producing around twenty pips or so in beginning of Asian session. As I understand you trade from Europe it makes a big difference with pair and session selection. Have to figure out couple of others that could work during my timezone Looking forward to see the results of the basket trader. My Regards

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Regarding testing of EU from Jan 2 through last Friday, and going through all the data to remove trades executed outside of agreed upon times, and removing any trades on NFP, and using 40 40 TP SL, here are the final results: (I also periodically went back through the charts to check actual candle data, and removed 3 to 4 trades each month) Sorry for sloppy data. Tabs in original document do not display properly here. 2017 EU 40_40 --------------W L BE Jan 1 - Feb 3 - 4 4 Feb 4 - Mar 3 -.5-- 1 Mar 4 - Mar 31- 1 1 1 Apr 3 - Apr 28- 3 1.7 3 May 1 - Jun 2- 6 2 3 Jun 5 - Jun 30- 2 3 Jul 3 - Aug 4- 3 2 1 Aug 7 - Sept 1- 4 1 4 Sep 4 - Oct 6- 4 1 3 Oct 9 - 23-- 3 1 0 Totals 28 16 19 = 556 pips (approx.)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Your effort is appreciated , so my eyes are widening when multiplying by 10 pairs ...

--- 帖子 #267 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++ I've performed cursory tests on a few other pairs. GU &amp; UJ performed the best, but not nearly as well as EU. Other pairs I've looked at, without editing MT4's results, all showed negative balances over the last 10 months. imho, The EA can do a wonderful job, however personal oversight is needed on all trades. Do your research to see the best parameters for all pairs you choose to trade.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Some problem here with 1.1 Ea... I've 2 different broker with quite same setup.. all with delayed set to true but why i don'have any order entries in activtrades ? Thanks Regards https://i.gyazo.com/1ce089a1f683ec78...3ef6346ccb.png

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi all With DD 1.1 EA, do you get open orders according with the rules ?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hi, Do you have an error logged in your Terminal logs tab at the time where it should have open the order? I have found a bug about pip value with some broker that will be fixed in the next release, maybe it's related with your issue.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Damiend, sorry to be a pain but i am slightly confused ref gmt broker time. i am -7 hours behind the UK but am using a UK broker. can you tell me the correct GMT broker time to insert? and can you disable the time limits so that you can trade at any time? thanks in anticipation.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
good morning guys Im still learning the system before i use it in a ea i want to learn it proprely so i still struggle to evade the flase signal maibe with a tight stop loss but i dont want to smuther the trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) Guys i still dint do the discord channel cause only one person reply Still waiting on your opinons

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Msmaximus, GBPJPY has high volatility, at the beginning you would better start from major pairs which MickeyMar uses in his trading: regarding your loss, there are no perfect systems without losses and noone promised you a holy grail, the best thing you can do as a trader is to follow rules and mm. That's it.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Ty for your input i apreciate, something that i alredyt know but its alwys good to ear it to make us realistics

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi pet3250, You will have to find your broker GMT time and enter it into the BrokerGMT parameter. Then the start date and end date to specify are GMT hours. It means if your broker is at GMT+3 and you want to trade between 9AM and 5PM your broker time, you will have: start date : 06:00 (your broker time - 3) end date : 14:00 (your broker time - 3) BrokerGMT : 3 But you could trade at any time too, and it's default behavior actually. UseTradingTimes=false means the EA will trade at any time.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
i have a supply and demand zone indicator that may help in eliminating false entries... All of these rules would be greatly helped with a zone indicator. At least to help know to close.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Thanks for the reply Damiend, looking forward to seeing some testing results. I have noticed that even when it is running with an open trade there is still a sign at the bottom left saying, "stopped" that cant be correct? I appreciate all of your work and efforts.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Overnight results... Attached Image (click to enlarge) No surprisingly, these are mostly losers, I guess where the SL works. The open trades all look good. Attached Image (click to enlarge) When I woke up I manually changed some of the open trades to increase protection. I am in Missouri, US Central time.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Over 70 pips this morning. Would have had more except I moved the SL on a couple of trades too close to price and got stopped out, still profitable. Thanks, Mickey, for this outstanding trading system. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thanks for your tests and your patience guys. Attached is the new version 1.2 The new features for this version are: A trailing stop. You will need to configure TrailingStop and TrailingStep for that. Set TrailingStop=0 to disable it. MinBarsBetween2Signals parameter which is the Minimum number of candles between 2 valid signals to avoid multicross CloseTradesAtOtherChannelSide parameter to close the trade when price closes on the other side of the channel TradingBrokerStartTime and TradingBrokerEndTime have been renamed to TradingGMTStartTime and TradingGMTEndTime. Sorry for that, but I noticed the old names were confusing and wrongs because it's not a broker time. A new simple UI that displays the EA status, a one click button to disable/enable the EA, and a one click button to open a manual trade. the UI can be disabled with the settings, or you can disable the "trade now" button only (for those who are now scared by manual trading ;-). Warning: the "trade now" button will open a trade immediately using the all the EA parameters (for Lot size, breakeven, trailing stop SL, TP...). It will place a SELL if the price is below the channel or a BUY if the price is above the channel. A bug fix for some brokers pip calculation. Another warning: the EA will work on currencies only for now. It will not work on gold and silver for example. The multipair closing strategy will come in another version. I think it's better to ensure we don't have too much bugs before adding this ;-)

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hey Damiend New version doesn't open any SELL orders, only open BUYs I tried diff timerames, including M15, same thing

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I've done a few test tests the results are much, much better with this version - I think we finally got something GOOD here. Surprisingly, I think the trailing stop will actually improve the performance. There is much much to see and test (I test visually, so it will take me a long time). But THANK YOU DAMIEND, for your very professional work so far.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Check settings of EA on General tab, there you can choose what type of orders EA should open ( only sell / buy / or both long and short) Maybe this will help. (my mt is in russian, but I think it's easy to understand what you need to check) Attached Image

--- 帖子 #284 ---
SUka blyat Detected ^^ im cs go player so just kidding ^^

--- 帖子 #285 ---
There's no reason for that, the EA manage the buy and sell orders the same way. As fotolia said, check in your "Common" tab that you allow the EA to open long &amp; short positions, attached is a screenshot in english. If it still doesn't work, could you be more precise ? Like posting a chart where it should have opened a Buy + the settings you are using. You could also check the Journal tab from your terminal (screenshot attached too), maybe it tried to open a buy but there was an error.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Nice, happy to read that Yes trailing stop could maybe improve the performance from an intraday perspective. I mean if the goal is to close the positions at the end of the day, it could help maximize the profits. But if the goal is to let the profitable trades running during the night, most of the time it will close the position too early. About the feature to close the trade when price closes on the other side of the channel, from my first tests on one pair I don't think it will be valuable for us, the results don't look good. I will post some test examples tomorow if possible.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Ty for all the job your doing it seems is becoming a pip machine

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Just spent some time with the tester. The attached chart and stats are for year 2017 to present, trailing stop, and no stop loss. When the stop loss is set to 0, the EA only goes long, so what you see are only long trades. When a SL is entered, the EA goes long and short. Not a recommendation, only food for thought.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++ Thanks CR. My problem is not getting time constraint trades using MT4. Therefore my results show up as being skewed. I've check for other testers, however, MT4 is the only one I've found that accepts all EAs. I'm back to visual testing, which is slow, but it's not like picking one out of a "Box of Chocolates"... at least I know what I see is pretty close to accurate.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Damiend, thanks for this, all up and running. I am on holiday from today and will let it run for the next 5 or 6 days on a new £10000 demo account to see what happens, should be interesting.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Damiend, any ideas why i keep seeing Stopped on my screen? you can see the icon smiling top right, and I have activated auto trading. https://charts.mql5.com/16/523/audus...services-2.png

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Damiend, I still had the old EA on my main testing platform last night... and it missed entering the EURAUD trade (delayed entry). I can't find any explanation (the dotted line was there, max spread was set to 6 (I have 2), the time spent at or below the level it was supposed to enter was more than sufficient... I checked all parameters, the EA was surely on... Could you have a look, please? the same thing happened on EURNZD. There is some bug with the delayed entries, which I'm not sure was fixed in the last version. I will close trades today and start testing with the last version the whole basket of pairs, just in case, but I thought you should know. https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/78042...global-markets

--- 帖子 #293 ---
In 1.2 version i have big problem and seems Ea can't opena any order. Seems time session problem ... look at my screenshot experts log says market closed... Hope for a solution.. Regards https://i.gyazo.com/9373ecd1e8ba69c8...b13bc4f0e4.png

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Mickey I am testing the old version too and my broker is Pepperstone Aud, my trade was taken on that EURAUD and EURNZD

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi I confirm the issue...no short trades. The MM is not working too.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi traders, Last night I left open my basket that was -70 pips. I mean left opened in asian session. This morning I've seen the basket has closed +100 pips, so again we are in positive this week. I see that it had would be more profitable leave it open all positive trades until "oposite signal". If I had set this way the basket we could reached three times more pips. More test is needed, that for sure. Attached Image (click to enlarge) thank you PD: still testing with old EA TONI

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi ChicagoRob, Thank you for these info, it helped me to find the bug with sell orders when when SL=0. I was opening sell trades if slPrice &gt; CHANNEL_HIGH only, it couldn't work with SL=0 ;-) Attached is a minor version 1.21 that fixes this SELL orders issue. And yes the curve without SL is interesting, but not advised because you know what could happen at the end

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thanks for your tests while you are in holidays! For this Stopped stuff at the bottom, I have no idea what this is about. It looks like you are using an indicator that prints information at the bottom but I don't know this indicator at all. It has nothing to do with the EA, the EA status "waiting for signal" is OK.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi MickeyMar, I'm not sure why it didn't open the trade. The two only reasons that could prevent the delayed entry to be opened are: a spread too high and a SL price &gt; channel low. For the spread, I will make an improvement in the next version because (for a Buy) it's using the Ask price to look for the EMA33 touch currently. I will use the Low of the candle instead to ensure the spread doesn't prevent some trades to be opened.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I think it's a broker related issue. It's an error message coming from the mt4 platform when trying to open an order. In your screenshot it tried to open an order at 23:59:59, I guess your broker doesn't take orders at this time.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks Damiend, I will look at this again. I have installed your latest update and it has just taken a UJ trade long, but it seems to be miles away from any MA, screen shot attached; https://charts.mql5.com/16/528/usdjp...l-services.png I have now also deleted every indicator and reloaded with out the silly stopped sign, so all good to go

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I don't know if I'm asking too much for this but would you include an option of hiding stop loss and take profit information from the broker ie process it from trader's machine instead of fixing it with the order. I'm requesting this because I've noted on 4 occasions on this demo account I'm using when my stop loss was tampered with by the broker and moved closer to the price. Thank God i delayed opening a real account with them besides i don't trust brokers and i suspect they are all to some mischief like hunting stop losses

--- 帖子 #303 ---
That;s the first time I hear about brokers faking stops on demo accounts... On the contrary, I believe, if they really want to cheat, demo accounts are exactly the ones they would leave alone, don't you think?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Ok, it looks like it is miles away, but from what I see on your chart, it's less than 40 pips + the SL is on the other side of the channel. So it's following MickeyMar's rule correctly. If one would like to reduce it, it would require to reduce the StopLoss, that's all.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Switch to another broker More seriously, it could be an interesting feature for live trading, thanks for the idea. But it would take some time to implement, test and ensure the trades are always closed as expected, else it could be dangerous and wipe a live account. So I prefer keeping that for later, when all the main features will be stable.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Thanks Damiend for your efforts. Have a suggestion here to have a variable as to the distance from MA that it should not trade. There were a few signals today that were at some distance from MA but were quite successful. with the variable, the user can decide as to the distance from MA that he is comfortable with. GBPAUD, unsuccessful trade at 20:15 Eastern time, with a possibly huge winner at 22:00 Eastern, though distance from MA was very high.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Is it possible that your stops were moved because of "trailing stop" function of the EA?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
At that time I was trading manually with no EA attached, i ditched that broker though....

--- 帖子 #309 ---
GBPUSD unsuccesful trade at 3:00 am Eastern and possibly a huge winner at 6:15 am, but for the distance from MA.

Hy... seems 1.21 is not able to open delayed order... https://gyazo.com/18be880e154272839035dccf5be138f9 https://i.gyazo.com/98e09a50264e60c5...a45dec7b62.png

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Damiend, so far today from london opening my system has only opened one trade on the UJ as mentioned above, is this what you would have expected and I would have thought that all of the traders who are operating within the same time frame would be opening the same trades and possibly more than the one trade?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Delayed trades picked up by v1.2

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Damiend, I just took 3 manual trades using the trade now button and all 3 trades were placed as per your specification. I also tried to take a trade when the position was still within the channel and that would not allow me, so thats working as well. just thought I would let you know.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Thanks but i'm referred to v 1.21 and your is 1.2 or not? Regards

--- 帖子 #316 ---
It seems that the problem with pip calculation remained in version 1.2 Attached Image (click to enlarge) StopLoss 500 instead of 50.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Yes mine was v1.2 Maybe something went wrong in the next ver 1.21

--- 帖子 #318 ---
There's no difference in delayed orders code between 1.2 and 1.21. The only change in 1.21 is a bug fix for sell trades when SL=0

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Hmm strange, with my broker it works. I use the mt4 Digits(), the stop loss calculation is like this for a BUY : Inserted Code slPrice = entryPrice - StopLoss*MyPoint(); double MyPoint() { double CalcPoint = 0; if(_Digits == 2 || _Digits == 3) CalcPoint = 0.01; else if(_Digits == 4 || _Digits == 5) CalcPoint = 0.0001; return(CalcPoint); } Maybe someone knows what's wrong there... Else could you send me your broker name via PM? Maybe I could create a demo account and test it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Here is the version 1.22 with a minor improvement with the spread during delayed entries I talked about earlier.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
You have "CalcPoint = 0.01; " Should it be 0.001? You can also try something like this: double CalcPoint =0.001; if(MarketInfo("EURUSD", MODE_DIGITS)==5 ) CalcPoint = 0.0001;

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Again same problem as reported before also with 1.22.. (order ok with old 1.1) Please anybody here can check same order with last version? Thanks Regards https://i.gyazo.com/7cbdacd572199ded...06ea54208b.png

--- 帖子 #323 ---
May be this helps Inserted Code slPrice = entryPrice - StopLoss*MyPoint(); double MyPoint() { double CalcPoint = 0; if(_Digits == 2) CalcPoint = 0.1; else if(_Digits == 3) CalcPoint = 0.01; else if(_Digits == 4) CalcPoint = 0.001; else if(_Digits == 5) CalcPoint = 0.0001; return(CalcPoint); }

Today's report: again awesome performance. I ran the EA from asian session untill 2 hours before NY close. Finally I close the basket with 81 green pips. At London open the basket was negative about 45 pips. Some good trades closed reverse the situation. At New York open it was positive already. Here the numbers: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If it was real account right now I think that I could close the week. Almost 200 pips a week it's enough for me. But we are testing. Tomorrow again we'll try. thank you all you, thank you Mickey and Damien TONI

Maybe this is better solution: Inserted Code double Pip; // I put this on global var // This goes to Init() double realDigits = Digits; // or MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_DIGITS); double gPointPow; if(realDigits &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; realDigits != 2 &amp;&amp; realDigits != 4) { realDigits -= 1; } gPointPow = MathPow(10, realDigits); Pip = 1/gPointPow; Calculate Pip variable in Init and use it after in whole program. This is faster then call function whenever we needed it. You may try this like script

My system has been open and working for the last 10 hours and it has only opened 3 trades. have you altered any of the original settings?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
What version your working on ?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
1.21 until 1 hour ago and then the latest 1.22 I keep getting the sell and buy and crossover indications in the box that appears on the left, but very very few trades have ever been opened. probably no more than 6 in total

--- 帖子 #329 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Awesome numbers Forexdaist. It looks like you simply set EA on every major pair, and let 'em run. I do see a few with early exits, which is from closing the basket, I think. Keep up the great work.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Thanks for your inputs guys. I will have a look at this pip calc issue today.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Well, I trade 21 pairs at time as a basket. I set the EA as Mickey basic rules, 40 pips TP/SL, breakeven at 20 pips profit. Sometimes I manually move some of the SL, and close few trades. Whenever I see a good decent profit I closed it all together. I don't mind the point the market are in. There's no need to be greedy. That's it. TONI

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Nice feedback and thanks. How do you set the trade time? Do you trade whole day or specific time period? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Please don't forget the indices CFD which use 1 Digit (Dax, Dow,...)

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Andrey, I have checked on your broker platform, I don't see any issue with the pairs you mentionned in your screenshot. For me: 134.436 - 133.935 = 0.501 =&gt; 501 points (or pipettes) =&gt; 50 pips 150.624 - 150.101 = 0.523 =&gt; 523 points (or pipettes) =&gt; 52 pips 0.68405 - 0.67905 = 0.00500 =&gt; 500 points (or pipettes) =&gt; 50 pips The StopLoss value is in Pips, maybe you expected it to be in Points?

--- 帖子 #335 ---
There must be something wrong somewhere, I have not adjusted anything on the EA, I am using the latest version, 1.22 there are 25 pairs now loaded and we are 2 hours into the london market and I have not had a single trade opened. is this correct and am I the only one that is experiencing this? I get the alerts appearing saying that there is a buy/sell signal. over the last 48 hours it has opened no more than 6 trades in total, all losers.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I don't use the time setings of the EA. I begin London open And close when I ser Good profit. Still we have to test EA performance under any market condition. toni

--- 帖子 #337 ---
The settings for when to trade are as per original in that it is set at false and able to open a trade at anytime. I want to let it run 24/5 to see what happens. it has just opened a trade on the EG long, 35 pips after the buy signal came. but its the only trade open at the moment. 5 pips up

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi guys, Just saw this thread and I like the system. I was just browsing for trades and saw one that might turn into a delayed entry setup. It's the EURGBP. Do note that we have upcoming EUR news.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks, I have tested your code with some indices. It works as expected with 1 digit stock, 3, 4, 5 digits currencies. But it still struggle with 2 digits, I have tested on gold and it produces a 0.01 pip value but the pip value should be 0.1 actually. Could I remove the "realDigits != 2" condition or does someone know some other 2 digits indices where it will not work?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Instrument with 0, 2 and 4 digits have same value for Pips and Points. But... Some Broker may have different digits for some instrument. My ICMarket have Gold, D30 (DAX), US30 (DOW), US500 (SP500) ... 2 digits This calculator say GOLD Pip is 0.01 And Dukas calculator for gold say: Attached Image USA30 and USA500 same 0.01 per pip Hm... You decide.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi damiend Any reason to not provide the code ?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
so after 24 hours continuous trading, it has opened and closed 7 trades, 3 by me manually, all in profit. system worked manually. 4 automatically with 4 losses. all settings as standard, version1.22 smiley face on. I do notice that the time stamp on the trades is not the same as the time on my PC i dont know if this has any effect? I will be travelling for the next 10 hours so I wont be able to leave the system on for that time but any comments would be welcome as this is a little disappointing.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Not a good day. EA running untouched since 5:00 pm Eastern. Practically all transactions prior to NY session lost. A few transactions at NY session running. One setup of v1.2 seems to be picking up delayed entries whereas another setup of the same version is not taking delayed entries. Another setup of v1.22 is not picking up delayed entries. Maybe some coding refinement will help.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Probably not the best idea to be trading eur/xxx over ECB, especially with such a long euro concentration , plus usd/chf is basically the inverse of eur/usd

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Super strategy but works best manual not EA.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yes, I use some personal librairies common to all my EAs that I want to keep private.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
That's normal, the trades times are broker times, not local times. The broker timezone is different than yours.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thank you. Yes, I really messed up the points and pipes.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
What is different between your two setups and what kind of improvement are you thinking about? Regarding delayed entries, in general, I think I will add an option so that we could take the entry at a certain distance from the 33EMA, and not only when PA touches it. I suggest that because I can see from my tests that some very good entries are missed. Attached is an example from today.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi, folks Today is not the best day. I m currently down 100 pips for the day, it was -150 few hours earlier. One day or one week is not a valid example for the validity of the system. It looks great and I m patient to see more. As MM said earlier, he had up to 8 (i believe) loosing trades in a row, and then profit again. We have to be patient. I would like to ask Damiend to add option to "delayed entries" (besides pending orders) - another pending order let's say 10 pips away from the signal. Meaning, if price doesn't retrace back to 33, and continues moving in signal direction - pending order will kick in.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks mate. I understand your point and will let your code as is then. It looks like the gold pip with my broker is 0.1 but I have a special case, all the infos I found on the web are saying 0.01 like you.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
No problem, it's complicated for me too.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Turned on my EA's at London lunch. Technically only 5 trades, although pic shows 6. I manually entered AudCad buy on pull back to 33. Then 33 did a flip flop, and gave another long signal, and EA opened the second trade. What I learned: Even if EA is set to open only 1 trade, it apparently doesn't see manual entry (yes, I used "Trade Now" Button). This is not a complaint, or request, this is just info for all using this method. GBP trades both hit profit Stop Loss. Note to self, 'I'll change GBP settings to 35, before going to BE'. GU would have hit TP (55), and GJ still has 20 to go. I'm satisfied with both the method, and the fantastic EA. Also grateful we have had very few missile tests from the FF Trolls. I too will go with 'forexdaist' method of starting with Tokyo open, going to London Close, or London Close -1. Any day with + pips is a Freakin' Awesome Day ! ! !

--- 帖子 #354 ---
What is slippage? It set to 3...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++ If you attempt to enter market @ 100, but broker does not honor entry until 104 (or 96), no trade will be taken.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
The two setups were the same and on ver 1.2 The difference was that the MT4 instance that took the delayed trade was running at the time the the initial signal was generated but was not taken due to the distance from MA, while the other was started later on and was not running at the time the initial signal was generated. As for "refinement", I was wondering if speed of executing the relevant code was an issue, you might look into it. I reviewed the journal around the time the delayed order was taken and observed that activities with respect to two other pairs was going on exactly at the same time. This was also the case with the MT4 instance that did not take the delayed trade.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Aah ok thanks for the details, I understand and know what happened. The speed isn't the issue. By default the EA starts to work and scan for signals at the current bar when it is loaded. It doesn't scan for signals in the past. That's a good improvement I could add to the delayed trades feature. At the EA init, I will add some code to scan for a delayed entry in the past. Thank you for your tests!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
thanks for your all of your hard work Damiend and others, we will get there. I am now going to set it running until friday close and then open it on asian opening and then let it run till next friday close to see what happens.

Hi Cesar8 The ATR indicator I gave to me does not appear on my chart. Help me please Regards,

--- 帖子 #361 ---
well bit of a turnaround now, 4 trades open with the EA and all in profit so far, will be running until NY close tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi, Vaxx. To load the ATR you must do it from the mt4 platform. entering by file. Open data folder. This directs it to drive C: / Find the path where the ATR file is downloaded. copy the two files, the executable as the MQL and paste them inside the folder MQL4, in the folder indicators and ready. Close the mt4 platform and start again, now it should appear in the files as indicators.

Hi, I followed the steps listed by you and nothing, the indicator is not attached to the graph. Help me please. Regards,

Hello traders, End of the week. I'v just closed the basket with 85 positive pips. Yesterday was my first negative day in 10 days of trading the strategy. I had 75 negative pips, but I have to say that two very good trades catched by the EA were close breakeven just for 1 pip. After that both would be 40 pips winners (USDCAD, GBPCAD). The numbers: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Total of banked pips first week: 196 Let's keep on! TONI

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Are you thinking at a limit order to benefit from a minor retracement or a stop order in case there is no retracement at all ? Regarding the first point, I made an improvement to the EA and am testing it currently. The delayed order would be triggered by a smaller Moving average and a configurable number of pips from it.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
its will be great if you can add additional choice to close the trade if the 33EMA close inside the channel, will be useful for trader with different risk appetite. TIA

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thank you and Toni for your tests reports !! Keep up the good work, the best is to come ;-) I will check that Trade now feature. It should take the manual trades into account while counting the total orders opened. I thought it was the case but maybe I forgot something.

yes, all same , i only change time frame

Hi, Mic FX, did your EA placed that delayed entry? My EA Didn't.

@bandit Are you placing these trades manually or with EA? Following the same rules? Thanks

--- 帖子 #379 ---
manually

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hey there, I loved the simplicity of this system however I think we are pushing too much with the EA. I understand people want to take advantage of off hour trading or whatever reason you might find to use an EA. But reading everything from the very beginning I feel like any EA created for this system cannot beat the manual trading due to the traders discretion. Even Mickey don't want to abondon manual trading with this system. So as well as we can develop the EA I think it would also be good to develop a signal generating indicator which would serve for manual trading. The reason I am saying is because there are a lot of people out there who doesn't like to use the EA but want to practice this system with their own ideas as well. I am not saying lets polute this tread with various other versions of it or millions of other indicators posted but to make it more user friendly. Saying that I would appriciate if anyone can code this EMA crossever indicator with push notification feature so even if we are not sitting in front of the platform we can easily check the chart and make our own decisions. Also it would be even better if someone can build a multi time frame of this indicator. I am saying that because I believe there are really good chance to catch up true waves or beak out points with lower TF confirmation. I would really like to see this indicator with M15 values on M5. Or H1 values on M15 charts. May be that would also contribute to the EA deveplopment.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Yes, additional options based on yesterday's missed opportunities with EUR. - one delayed pending order when price goes back to 33 (already in EA) - another delayed pending order 10 pips below or above the signal price. If price stops moving in the direction of a signal - it will go back to 33, in case it continues - it will trigger another order. Let's try it out?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Try this... added all kind of alerts (Didn't changed anything regarding your MTF wish)

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Cheers mate, It would be awsome if we get something for MTF as well

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks for effort... Could be possibile have a kind of dashboard with signal per TF could be really useful for manually trading... Regards

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Noted on opening platform today: I did not leave MT4 running overnight. When I opened it this morning, it immediately took a trade on EurAud, even though ten minutes of the subject candle had already passed. In this case the entry was 12 pips in my favor. It could have also been the opposite. This is just something to be aware of, if you are using EA. Knowing this, it might not be a bad idea to turn off "Autotrading" button at top of platform, if you're going to shut down, and reopen MT4.

Attached is a new EA version 1.3 with some bugs fixes : fix for pip value calculation, the EA should work with more Symbols and brokers added a check to MaxOpenedTrades in "Trade now" button feature fix to keep the delayed entries signals in memory properly until the SL is tight enough to take the trade or if another signal appears And a two new features: At the EA init, it will scan for a delayed entry in the past that is still valid. If it finds one, the delayed entry will be traded as per usual EA rules A new DelayedEntriesStrategy input parameter that you can set to : 33EMA or 25GWT. The 25GWT is a linear weighted moving average that will allow the EA to take the delayed entries more aggressively. And a new DelayedEntriesAtXPips input parameter where you can set a number of pips from the moving average where a delayed trade can be opened. If you want to keep using the original MickeyMar's strategy, you can set DelayedEntriesStrategy=33EMA and DelayedEntriesAtXPips=0, this means a touch to the 33EMA.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I did a quick test on pair (GU) from 2015.01.01 to 2017.10.01 (Max 2 trades: 0.1 lot for the 1st, 0.05 the 2nd) With version 1.22, the result was a 2193.49 profit and 19.09% drawdown Attached Image (click to enlarge) And the same test with version 1.3 using DelayedEntriesStrategy=25GWT and DelayedEntriesAtXPips=5. The result is a 2844.07 profit and 16.65% drawdown Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Can anyone explain what the TrailingStop exactly doing here? I'm still confused. Thanks ahead! Jeff

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Damiend, Does the EA have a min lot size? I had been running it on a demo account (and doing well) on a 0.1 lot and I tried to put it on my real account and lower the lot and it didn't take trades (the demo did).

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Awesome Damien!!! thank you again TONI

--- 帖子 #399 ---
the ea ,using your setting gave back 50% of the profits. You need better setting to bank more profits.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
It's strictly a baseline demo. Settings are not mine - they are default.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
the new EA give even better results on back test tried the EA on live most jpy pairs and cross pairs give less resaults i think most trades that the EA took and went to sl was at good profit in some point so it's better to monitor &amp; close profit trades even when they are at 20 pips profit then they will reverse to lose or to 1 pip BE thank's demien

--- 帖子 #402 ---
MaxOpenedTrades - does it apply for overall opened trades or just the pair that is running this EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
You're great. :-)

--- 帖子 #404 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++ Excellent Damiend. Did you use time constraints for testing on GU? And were your targets 40 TP &amp; 40 SL?

Hi everyone ... and thank you! In my opinion I have to put filters not so much on the ea but the method .... above the mobile average 200 only long ..... you say ???

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hello Traders, I've been a lurker on FF for quite a long time and this thread has sparked such an interest for me that I had to formally sign up and join in the conversation. Firstly, A massive thank you to Mickey for bringing this to my/our attention, its very much appreciated. I too have been searching for a simple MA system like this and was hell bent on finding it but you have beaten me to it lol. I have been studying the charts with this set up and just love what I see, this suits my trading style perfectly so thanks again. Personally I would never rely on any EA as for me it cuts out the fun in trading. And of course there is no better indicator than the human brain so I want to be the decision maker on every trade I take. I appreciate this is why you Mickey brought the idea here in the first place to seek an EA but I shall be using this manually and I don't think you will ever beat that in my opinion. But your desire for an EA has brought this method to us all so I'm very grateful. Further to the above I wont be relying on the immediate EMA cross for entry either as its a bit late for me so I will only be looking to take the delayed entries. I want to see a pull back first before getting in. With the above said I want to share how I will be trading this method which may be of interest to others. It's certainly worth looking at and I hope it helps..... In addition to the use of MA's I like analysing and trading price action off major price levels so I like to use the Quarters Theory. I use the Quarters Theory indicator on my charts which is available here in FF which was kindly created by Swing Man - https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=567962 Analysing these levels can provide that extra confluence when using this MA method when trading the delayed entries. In some cases you could even get in before the cross happens. For example when the 33 ema looks like its very close or about to cross over one of the 55ema's, as per the rules, you can see price cross and pull back to the quarters levels and continue in your direction. Its worth adding the indicator to your charts just to have a look and you will see exactly what I mean. Please note I'm in no way trying to hijack this thread. I just want to try and help and offer what I can see through this combination of indi's which provides that extra confluence to this method. I wanted to share to show my gratitude to Mickey. All the best, Hissy

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Try using a 10 or 14 ema price cross

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Yes you are right, we cant just take all crosses to enter the trade, ive been trading something similar also, not to hijack this thread,we have to see what the higher time frame price action doing also, i always check 2 to 3 higher time frame before pulling the trigger, for me ill prefer manual trading VS EA, i make sure higher time frame channel are also align with 15min, and i always wait for the price to pull back, i have and very old EA that will alert when retrenchment is present on my prefer time frame by checking higher time frame, so when ever my EA alert me with pop up msg, ill just double confirm one more time before pulling the trigger, in this way i minimize my exposure to too many pairs and limit my risk, best is to go with 4hr, make sure 4hr,1hr and 3 min are below/above the channel .. but MM method really help me to avoid ranging market and keeps me in the trade. the credit goes to him for opening up this thread, we are here to help to fine tune this method. im not against EA trading , it up to individual traders , for me ive plenty of time to sleep on me PC and observe the market.always watch the higher time frame sup/ress area. green pips to all

2 great posts from hissy and forexbandit lets hope that we can add indicator to ea. thread is going from strength to strength what time of day do you guys trade are you both pro traders or part time. Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hello MickeyMar first off congrats on a very interesting strategy and for starting this thread. I have followed a similar MA cross over strategy in my manual trading and it's been successful some of the time but not all of the time, so this is a very interesting approach to trading the MA cross. I am one of those traders from the CCFp basket trading thread and I trade baskets successfully live, so I will be following and testing this strategy to see how to incorporate it in basket trading. I have been testing the EA running some back tests on the major pairs testing out different settings to find one that will work successfully overall, and so far the results are impressive with a good 10-20% growth with minimal DD. If this is sustainable long term this can be a powerful and profitable strategy and I can see myself on a yacht in the Caribbean very soon one day!

--- 帖子 #413 ---
HI What settings are you using for backtest?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Here it is but be aware this was through back tests only. This week I'll be testing with different settings so this setting could change depending on what I see and learn and from live results.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I was away for a while (personal stuff) and only now was able to catch up with the thread. Wow... I am again congratulating myself for puttting this system here, seeing that many of you guys are putting it to good use and selflessly sharing your experience and ideas. I really appreciate it! I have been testing with 1.2 many pairs, with active trailing stop. I like what I see. The trades are almost all stopped out, many in profit. I will share the statement and settings at the end of the week. My live trading with the EA went really bad the first 2 days, I took some quick losses (the entry moment was badly chosen) so I traded manually to recover. Due to this I don't have relevant live experience with the EA yet... Soon... I appreciate the input and view of kxeroo. Indeed, I am of the opinion that better is often times the enemy of the good, and having traded this system manually for years (successfully) I feel some discretion should also be used. A robot is best put at use when subjected to the will of a human We can't ask that this EA should be able to cook for us, too So I agree we should not try to swing every detail of the system until it looks good on EA testing. Backward testing is of no value when it comes to future results. What I discovered (the system) was done using the logic and experience of the market and working with EAs. Now Damien's 2015-2017 testing with such good results is for me very valuable exactly because it was not done "backwards" and fit to give profits - the system existed before 2015, and it gave profit "in the future", not in the past. But there are some "tweaks" which I'd really like to explore further Bandit's M5 trading is amazing, in my opinion. I thought of it too, and tried to follow to see if it works, but didn't want to divert my attention from the system, and my experience with THESE signals. These M5 signals should work very well with the timing settings (only active sessions), and the trail option. I would really appreciate bandit if you could gather some, say, 100 trades and then share those results with us in a nice sheet All taken with the same setup on M5. Also the multi-timeframe idea is fantastic - but I don't know how difficult it is to implement. I have another system based exactly on multi-timeframe (also based on MAs) but I'm unable to still trade it due to this difficulty... maybe soon I will share that with you as well, as it is the only system i used long enough to be worth sharing (apart from this channel MA system and manually trading the Elliott Wave setups). I also appreciate Diamond's sharing of his results, please keep it up diamond, we need a longer test period to draw relevant conclusions (same as Bandit's M5 setups). Busted - is that real trading or demo? great results man! The default EA settings are not necessarily the best - I think Damiend never said that they were. You guys should take from there what suits your trading style and preferences. But please share the best results, so we can test on our end too. You guys really rock!

Here is an EA for signal, please take note and pay attention . DO NOT TAKE OPEN TRADE BASED ON THIS EA SIGNAL!, This EA will just check for the higher time frame EMA alignment for you, im not a coder so i just adjust the time frame i want it to check for me to alert for retracement on 15 Min. Once you have a pop alert ,1. check your 15m chart 33 EMA is outside the channel ,2. dont trust this EA, go to the next few higher time frame to visually check all the EMA are align, (higher time EMA can be your fav EMA, for me i prefer 60,14,or 10. 3.Enter trade based on your preference ,market or pending buy/sell from the signal candle( retracement candle. if some one can fine tune this EA based on MM method ,it will a be great help for all the traders. Green pips to all

--- 帖子 #417 ---
No there's no min lot size in the EA, but your broker could have one.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
It applies to the pair where the EA is running only. The function that counts the opened trades uses the pair and the configurable EA magic number. It means you could even have a MaxOpenedTrades per timeframe if you run the EA on multiple timeframe for the same pair, by setting a different magic number.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I didn't use any time constraint for this test, I used UseTradingTimes=false. The settings were: SL 30, TP 180, BE 25/15, and no TS. I didn't have a time to make a lot of tests though, It can be improved for sure.

İ appreciate this EA and want to ask if coder master can add two option to this EA. 1-Lot increment when order type changes ,buy to sell or reverse 2-Close partially of all orders ,according to sumPL of closed and openned orders

Attached Image Is that DelayedEntries not working? This trade open few minute ago and far away from 33EMA

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi Damien, Today the EA don't work well. Closed all trades second after opened. I am using the first "classic" version EA. I've traded with it all last week without any problem, so I can't find where the trouble can be. Don't know. Have any idea? Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is one exemple. thanks in advance TONI

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I'm testing the EA on 6 of the major currency pairs and so far the EA has opened 5 trades. 2 of the trades have hit TP so far, and 3 are still running. I'll monitor and keep track this week and report back with my results. So far no issues found with the EA and its opened all positions as it should.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
As I explained already, the delayed entries work in relationship with the StopLoss to stick to the original strategy. If the EA has enough space to set the StopLoss at the other side of the channel, like it did on your screenshot, then it will take the trade. If you want to open the trades nearer the 33EMA, you could set a tighter StopLoss.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Toni, Do you mean the EA closed the trades some seconds after the opening? Or do you mean you closed the trades manually because something went wrong? In all case, you should try the latest version because some bugs were fixed since the 1.1

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I mean EA closed all trades automatically just in seconds after opened. I'm also testing last version of the EA, later I'll post my report. I think I've had some issues.... thank you Damien, you are very kind TONI

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi all ! Today I made a forward test and I am confused. Should not the robot open a position where I have noted?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Good results from yesterday through noon today using default settings. Will keep testing.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I'm not surprised... your "AUTOTRADING" which is on the status bar is not "ON" I would also like to add that if this EA can have a higher TF trend check, it will eliminate many of the false trades triggered! Have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #432 ---
very nice set up looks good

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I agree. Like on trigger trade if H4 or H1 cross is already in direction of trade, or something like that but still the manual trading works really well and takes care of this issue pretty well

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thank you for your answer but this is just visual graphic .The robot was working on another chart and the auto trading was ON , I have smile face and in the settings I set the delay entry on true .

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Hi, I don't see any cross between the 33EMA and the 55EMA low on your chart...

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Thanks for the good idea, I think I will add an optional H1 and H4 trend check in the next version for us to test.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
@ damiend Thanks for keeping improving your EA. Since the pip value is not the same for different pairs, can I ask to implement a % risk option for the delayed entries as well? Thank you

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi Damiend, Its good to see you are trying improve the EA, here are some suggestion that you might add into the EA if possible, 1 Let the user choose the EMA for delay entry currently you have preset to 25LWM,let the user chose the own fav EMA for delay entry instead of preset 25LMW. 2 SL, close trade if the 33EMA close inside the channel, This is to suit diff trader risk appetite . 3 EA only take trade based on 4HR and 1Hr EMA driection, Assuming 14 EMA below or above 60 EMA on 4hr and 1hr and 30 min,This way we trade with the long term trend . 4 EA able to request to open trade(semi auto),User can decide if he/she wants to take the trade based on their own analysis . i know its aload to do, hope you can consider it. TIA

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Since yesterday a total of 9 trades have been opened by the EA so far, 2 have hit TP, 1 hit SL, and 6 are still running. 3 of the running trades are in DD with 1 of them close to SL. Still too early to tell, and will see on Friday how this weeks performance goes using this strategy on the 6 majors.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I think you all go in wrong direction. Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. Antoine de Saint-Exupery If you add new filter, you not only filter bad trades. If you have good RR, you lose more. This system is very good, you not improve it with any filter. Your discretion is best filter (button trade/not trade) Less is more

340 net pips in six days, original version with defaults, no time restrictions.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
hi friends , original version mean which one ? can u please re-uploaded hear . thanks

--- 帖子 #443 ---
It's actually version 1.1, so technically it's the second version. You can find it under the paperclip up top.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
++++++++++++++++ FYI in all of my backtesting, I found out that when "Closing" a trade, should it have a candle that closes on opposite side of channel, was terrible, when price was ranging. I would imagine it could be even worse to close inside channel. imho. If you really want to do this, then simply move your SL to desired price.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I have a request; I'm working with Damien to create a manual for his EA. If you have any specific things you have discovered, things that were a surprise to you, or just unusual things, please note them here. It would be a help to all of us, and help in creating a comprehensive user manual. Thanks, Darryl It may be best to PM me with things you have found, so we can validate, and avoid clogging up this thread with banter.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++ Good show. Thanks for sharing. I believe last week, at one point, you only traded from Tokyo open. Now you are going 24 hours daily?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes, just letting it run unattended. Spreads are low during the NY session, so I may try that next.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
++++++++++++++++++++ How big are your Stones? Will you let it run over the weekend? btw, for those not living in US, we go to Standard Time on Sunday. Clocks reset Back one hour.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I don't, generally, like to hold positions over the weekend, so my stones are small. Good reminder on Standard Time. New end/start time for the daily candle.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Picked up something strange, possibly a bug? I got the alert form the MA cross indicator for the cross over on GBPUSD, but the EA did not open any buy trade?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Was it to far above the channel?...or do you have that turned off?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
turned the EA just hour ago the GU was very quick profit

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I traded this method manual on Monday using 6 pairs. Throughout Monday all the pairs were in the negative and one of the 6 even hit my stop loss of -45 pips but the others ranged between 20 to 35 pips negative. I was worried and doubtful but since it's demo I decided to just let it run and guess what, today all remaining open trades, almost 24 hours later, closed in the positive. This is a great strategy but I think as someone mentioned earlier, before you take the trade make sure that at least 2 higher time frames are also going in your direction and if so, be patient as it might take 24 to 48 hours to win the trade. Also the EA version 1.3 is doing very well too.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++ GU was too far from opposite side of Channel. 40+ on my charts. Also your EA should have marked that candle with vertical Silver line, as on chart below.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Many thanks again Darryl for your work on the EA manual, it will help a lot!

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Nice results, congrats ;-) I still didn't have time to start a multipair test on my side, hopefully soon.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi all. First I want to say thanks for this very good strategy and for very good EA. For those of you who want to close trades as a basket I have 2 EA. One is to close trades at X amount of profit (which I use) , and the other one is to close at X amount of pips (didn't tested). Just install EA at any clean chart and it will close trades when reach desired amount.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Did I perhaps missed a setting built into the EA that limits opening trades after a certain distance from the channel? I know about the delayed entry rule from the first post, but don't see why the EA did not open the order. The signal was 30 pips above the channel, and if the EA had opened the trade it would have already hit the 40 pip TP.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Does anyone have an interesting set to share? I can not create a profit set Many thanks to the helpers

--- 帖子 #460 ---
İ want to repeat my request for this valuable EA. İ appreciate this EA and want to ask if coder master can add two option to this EA. 1-Lot increment when order type changes ,buy to sell or reverse 2-Close partially of all orders ,according to sumPL of closed and openned orders

--- 帖子 #461 ---
At my charts EA doesn't open any trades at all. Have anyone any thoughts about this? I tried default settings but EA doesn't open any trades After I got curious if I change settings for delayed entry to take trade on the distance 30pips from 33EMA to make EA to take a trade under the push. But it doesn't take any trade anyway, screenshot attached. Will be appreciate for advices. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #462 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++ Match your Broker time to the times you want to trade. Set "Use Trading Times" to 'True'. Then set "BrokerGMT" to '0'. Make sure "AutoTrading" button is Green. See if that helps.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Unfortunately, same situation.. no result Attached Image (click to enlarge) *UPDATED* EA has opened trade with standart settings, were changed only these two parameters: (1) GMT=1(my broker time) (2) Use Trading Times=False

how that s* can be real?

i got nu short, and n/j long from EA gladly break even, longing this mother* ficker myself

hello friends my EA does not open any operation, I go to Spain and I leave my settings to see if anyone can help me. thank you very much for sharing and helping the most novice as I greet Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Should we pause or close the EA during big news like NFP time ??

--- 帖子 #470 ---
yes I know, but I didn't opened SELL, that was made by EA what is very strange as I don't see any signal and strange it did open short position on such distance from singal line and etc..

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I have the same problem with version 1.30. I upgraded yesterday morning and left it on for 24 hours but no trades were taken. Reverted back to 1.22 now and 2 trades have been opened already... Anyone else having the same problem?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I had same problem, this helped

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I had it right already with the difference that my broker is +3 but it didn't help. I wonder if it's something to do with reverting back to winter time...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
today profit and basket was nearly +70 i think why is your EA took opposite trade, check magic number different in each pair, the common-&gt;allow DLL import is on

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi, Thank you for your ideas. Sorry this thread is so active that I focus on helping people that have troubles with the EA/strategy and I miss some posts somtimes. Could you elaborate on why you would like to have the 1/? And how the 2/ would work? Are you thinking at a daily pips target? A basket close at daily target is planned already, but we thought about closing the orders fully, the partial close to let the profits run could be a good idea maybe.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Strange, it should have placed a trade or set vertical line to indicate a delayed entry (depending on your SL value at this time) when the cross occured around 17:00 on your chart. If the EA were running at this time of course. Did you have an opened order failed or something in your logs around this time? Even if the EA was working on your side, setting the DelayedEntriesAtXPips=30 wouldn't have helped to take the delayed trade. Below is the explanation on the picture. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
For those who have issues with the Time filter, try to set UseTradingTimes=false, it will disable the time filter entirely. Then test again with filter on and if you still have issues with this time filter, I will check how to improve it. Well in any case, I will try to improve it or add some debug infos because it looks like it is a common issue.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Damn yea, I have checked usgin the strategy tester, I can't reproduce that. Maybe a cross occured quickly or during the high volatility, but it would surprise me because the EA waits for the candle close to consider a cross. I will make some tests and maybe add a global security check to prevent opening sell orders above the channel and buy orders below the channel.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks damiend. But I've always set it to false as I open and close the EA manually. Only v 1.30 gives me that problem.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Logic is very good on the EA But İ must say that there are many bugs that can be seen on strategy tester. 1-Lot sizing option dont work. 2-Money management option dont work And eitherly Can those options be added 1-Lot increment when order type changes ,buy to sell or reverse 2-Close partially of all orders ,according to sumPL of closed and openned orders Respects

the Ea have its flaws but it filters at least 80% of the good signals TY for the killer strategy Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Falanca, I am doing tests now, and just today I used both features mentioned by you, and seemed to work just fine. Im using version 1.2 of the EA.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
it take sometime trade before the cross may be that not bad many pairs end up in +10 pips from default trailing set up and continue after worry is if 2 trades will hit sl, it will take back all this week.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Checking out Higher Time Frames.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Diamond Which arrow indicator do you use with the LWMA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #488 ---
+++++++++++++++++++ MA Crossover Alert, listed in this thread. I Use two. One for 55 Hi, and One for Low. On the Hi, I use no down color, and vice versa. That way I don't get arrows I don't need. Orange MA is 8 LWMA. Trading the H4, I only look for signals that go beyond set up candle by at least 10 pips. That will eliminate many false signals. I will not post anymore about this set up, in this thread, out of respect for those trying to focus on our main topic.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thanks diamondbw. I have been experimenting with different values, as well. I like what I see with your setup. H4 is MUCH more convenient for me. Green pips for everyone!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi and thanks for this awesome system! I just wanted to share the EA I use for money management because Im trading this manually. You can set automatic tp, sl and trailing. Awesome if your not by the computer at all times.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
I dont tink its bad you been posting another way of trading the same strategy cause we all diferent and things work different for each one of us so i dont mind you posting in fact i apreciate i tink that only mickey and damien can say something cause they the one having all the trouble with the thread

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I've been testing some different MA parameters for the channel an signal line just to see what works. I'm testing the default settings, edited default settings, and customized parameter settings, all on the same pairs to see which is more profitable and consistent. I will say though that the default settings haven't been to great so far.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
DamienD, I have a request of my own, if possible, if it's not too much trouble... It was mentioned by 2 other members here, and I also like that idea a lot &amp; would like to test it. How about if we introduce a filter that would only take the signals in the direction of a higher timeframe signal? Example: while the H1 chart is on a BUY signal (or price above the channel), the M15 takes only LONG trades and ignores the shorts. This could help, because we could set larger stops for our trades (being confirmed from "above") and keep them for more pips (as they follow the overall bigger picture). The setting could sound something like: Filter timeframe: options: H1, H4, D1. Or just higher timeframe, whatever's easier for you technically. Do you think that's doable? Thanks man!

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Also, I'd like to back up the idea of a global rule that would prevent the EA from EVER opening shorts above the channel or longs below the channel (as you suggested).

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Selective manual trading result for today, right side at the right time.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Hi MM, try filtering with 60 and 14 EMA on 4hrs, this keep with you in long term trend, i only trade in the direction 60 and 14 ema on 4hr direction. once this 2 EMA are align then i go to 15min and wait for cross of 33EMA on 55 channel or if cross already happen ill wait for price to retrace to 33 EMA by 5-10 pips.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
The Enforcer (AKA: DD-channel-MA) pulled off a trade that lasted 25 seconds on Delayed Entry.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ It's always a good idea to do your own testing. I've done quite a bit myself. One of the things I'm convinced of, is that the 55 Channel is Excellent. I'm certain Mickey has done extensive testing to determine this. Doing your own testing and experimenting is how creativity happens. Everyone has their own methods, as well as opinions. Always remember that opinions are neither right or wrong, they are simply Opinions. Use them according to your own values.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
LOL!! My Enforcer decided to pick up GBPJPY delayed entry and was stopped out 40 pips in 3 seconds.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
There seems to be a bug in the current version of the EA. Signal line crossed below the lower channel but no sell order was opened?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Guys, i suggest you to go on the thread "Schaff Trend Cycle", i think it could improve very much this system. Try these settings for basic Channel-MA: Signal dotted LineM15 10,23,50,3 Signal normal lineH4 10,23,50,3 On the daily: (i see channel-MA can make THOUSANDS of pips when you catch the trend) Signal dotted line D1: 10,23,50,3 Signal normal line W1: 10,23,50,3 Let me know what do you think!! Here you can see two examples with the basic system and daily version:

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Yes, that's not a big deal. I'm traveling this week so not sure you will have it, but beginning of next week for sure. If I add one option like UseHigherTimeframeTrend where the values would be a predefined list with every timeframe from M5 to W1, would it be ok for everybody ? Or do you need two options to filter using 2 highers timeframes? I would like to keep it simple as much as possible.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Damn it could have been a nice trade ;-) Just a thought but maybe 40 pips SL is not enough for this GJ because the moves are bigger than others pairs..

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Could you send a screenshot of your EA settings? Also do you have some debug message around this time in your Journal/Log tab from the terminal view? Did the EA take the previous BUY I can see in your screenshot or was it a manual trade? Thanks !

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I'd prefer it SIMPLE, one timeframe of choice as a filter. Thanks &amp; bon voyage!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi damiend please see a screenshot attached. There is no message except for the alert message form the ChMaCross indicator. No the previous signal there was no trade as the parameters of the EA were different at that time.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
My delayed entries worked like a charm during the news today... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Hey MickeyMar are you still using the original default settings of the EA or have you made some changes?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
What's the reason behind the discrepancies.......

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Killer trades, bro.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++ Gray Vertical line, signals that stop was too far from entry. Over 50 pips on my charts.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
This has also happened to me and I don't fully understand why?

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) for now these are the settings for all pairs, but I will adapt them according to my testing and according to volatility, im not done testing yet (takes hours for every pair). My basket account active for about a week is now in profit, although many trades were not taken (many green pips missing). But I don't think i have the guts to trade them all live, not yet at least, I will stick to some 6-10 pairs. Will post the best settings I found here, when Im done.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
if using trend might miss enters also, mickey mar can you share your settings please to EA 1.2 you got 100 more pips set to tp 1.3 acting bit weird today

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Been lurking on FF for quite a while (a couple of years) and have tried a bunch of strategies, but I love the simplicity of this one. For trading a trend it just works! Many pros talk about using a couple of EMA's on their charts, and that's it, of course many of them are using S &amp; R lines and trend lines, etc. as well. So what I'm finding is that the EA works well... BUT ONLY when it catches the trend. Otherwise it stops out or we have a 50/50 chance of it going well as time progresses. And maybe that's the key, over time there are simply more wins than losses overall. For example... EURUSD - the channel eliminated a lot of ranging but after the big trend drop recently, it's been a little brutal. If you're trading this manually, how have you guys been filtering out the ranging?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
İ think this EA must be coded by another coder.Becouse logic is good but no function works properly

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Falanca, I think we should be grateful for the time and commitment shown by Damien. We all work together here to eliminate the bugs, test, share, so we can have a better EA. Unless you can code the EA yourself please show respect for his work.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I agree damiend has done a great work voluntarily for us, it's completely natural for an EA to have bugs initially, that why we as a community of traders test together to fix whats not 100%, and work on improving things. It's only v1.3 so yes I can also agree that there are still a few bugs and things to iron out but so far we have something with a LOT of potential.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I think the logic is excellent in this strategy but I think that only manual trading will yield the best results because while the system is simple there are some subjective elements that require the human touch I feel such as considering higher timeframe trend and s/r, when to exit, money management, setting the stops and tp at a good level(the 210 TP rules sounds good but if you wait until end of session price can go against you before the session ends). SL/TP placement is the real challenge in forex in my opinion even more so than entry. Also looking at price action or other factors to avoid ranges will be need the human eye as well. But still a great thread. Maybe using adx can help filter the ranges

--- 帖子 #520 ---
hi, I checked and implemented the indicator, but nothing shows up (4Hr TF)

--- 帖子 #521 ---
completely agree, we are all very grateful for the time and effort that Damiend has given us.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thanks much for sharing this great strategy and thanks to those who made the EA's. Been following this thread for a while now only reading but seems like i might improve someones results by a simple hint. Im trading the EA in its version 1.1 (DD-channel-MA-1.1) with default settings on EU, GU, UJ, UCHF, AU, UCAD. Default TP and SL is set to 40 BUT i actual manage the trades manually on the SL. Cant put a finger on a simple rule for that but just move SL according to the last markable high/low. Here a my results from a cent account since 7 trading days: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS: Seen some posts about "missed" entry. You might check your brokers spread an the EA's max spread value. That might do the trick.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Mikey Can't understand how do you manage to avoid the 40 pip loss in GBPJPY. I had same settings as you but the spike reach the SL. I also want to send my support to Demian. Your EA is very good. I've been having good results for almost two weeks. We have just to test some more time and then we can go live. Thank you all. Thank you Damien! TONI

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Please respect the work of our fellow trader cause hes doing his best , if you can do better or say some construtive critics i apreciate it too but if you just for puting down all the work please respect all of us. The strategy is a mazing and ea is amazing too. The Ea will take alot of time until its at his best possible but the journey is the fun part too. MM and D i thank you for your work guys and i will try my best to add something usefull.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I usually have 2 different brokers charts going. When the GJ move happened, there was a 15 pip difference in the up move, from one to the other. That's not uncommon, and probably why you lost on that trade.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Thanks for this Dtde, i appreciate it cuz it's live trading experience (even if on cent account). Please keep us updated! Forexdaist - it was plain luck, actually, the order could not be filled at the requested price but much higher (due to extreme volatility), which means the 40pips SL was also higher and price didn't hit it. But just as I was lucky on this one, I was unlucky not to be filled on other GBP pairs that went flying today... Anyway, it's pretty clear that 40pips on the volatile pairs is too little, as their channels are many times larger than that... I will post all my test results soon, with my conclusion and the settings for live trading. Damien, what do you think is the safest EA to trade, which version, in terms of stability and lack of bugs?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Ok thank you for the screenshots! From what I can see with your chart and your settings, it's not a bug. Let me explain again the rules implemented in the EA from MickeyMar's original strategy: The signal (cross) is valid after the candle close only (around 1.32400 on your chart, where I have drawn the bottom line) If the EA can't set the StopLoss on the other side on the channel, the entry is not valid and there won't be ay trade opened. You have set the StopLoss at 30 pips and the entry was more than 30 from what I see on your chart The EA could have opened a delayed entry in this case, but you don't use the delayed entries from what I see in your settings, you have UseDelayedEntries=false Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Dont missunerstand me please.İ appreciate all work here.İ only mean perhaphs other way of coding may be more suit for that logic.Just this.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
For example MickeyMar who is the master of the idea also ask this Damien, what do you think is the safest EA to trade, which version, in terms of stability and lack of bugs?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Nice results, congrats and thank you for sharing it Yes, very good point on the spread. Don't forget to check that guys, and as I remember the EA should print a debug line with the spread when it tries to open an order. It could help you to troubleshoot this kind of issue.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thanks for your support guys! I appreciate. Falanca, Please be constructive, as everyone else tries to be in this thread. If you find some bugs, please report it with some details. And if you want an EA with all your custom needs for tommorow, try to do it yourself or pay someone because you are not at the right place. And of course, everyone could make and post an EA for this strategy. I don't own anything here and I would be more than happy to test another EA or collaborate.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I think the best thing is to perform the operations manually, many times the discussions in the forums are confused in the search an EA to do all the work. Many forums die for the ambition of a public that thinks that EA solved everything.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Thank you damiend for the clear explanation, I was not aware of the SL having to be set on the other side of the channel, I must have missed that. I was doing some backests and had better results with 30 pip SL than 40 pip SL. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
MM and Damiend, are you going to let the EA run on auto through the non farm payroll etc? I will just to see how it performs. I am running the latest version.

What should be the settings for Slippage and MaxSpreadPips....?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Mickey, The latest one the v1.3 is the safest, and generally speaking it will always be the latest minor version because most of the time I fix some bugs and add some optional small features between minor versions. Regarding the bugs, I have the bug when there is high volatility to fix still (sell below channel and buy above only) so I don't advise to use the EA live yet. For the others various bugs reported about entries not taken, I still have nothing concrete to work with, each time I checked some screenshots sent to me, I found out it was an EA config issue. But I'll make more tests for sure.

Hi, Has anyone tested on DE30? below 1/Nov/216-1/Nov/2017

--- 帖子 #541 ---
what about ur version &amp; set ? thanks

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Guys, I finished the initial testing and these are the results (tested from 2015-2017). I will go live with these settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
May I know if you'll be limited only to these 4 pairs for your live trading...?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Initially yes, then if I am comfortable with other pairs' results I will gradually add them. I tested basket trading the EA for some time now (a few weeks) but I still haven't made steady profits in that demo (automatically), so I'm still researching the optimal settings. For me now trading the EA with some manual discretion on limited pairs seems like the best option.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I hope you realize that you are taking a risk running these on a live account. Your model quality on your backtest is N/A. I suggest to anyone who tries these settings run it on a demo account first.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thanks for the warning. I really don't care too much for the tests, especially backtests. Even if the modelling quality were perfect, there's zero guarantee it will work the same in the future. I just use those tests to set up my EA on each pair - I will manually adjust the trades according to my S/R levels and close trades manually, the EA is there to make sure I don't miss setups

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Some people are asking me in pm a lot of things about my screens. Here i post a conversation + indicators and .tpl, maybe it could help someone. "It's very easy. The normal line shows us the trend on a major timeframe, which "control" the minor timeframes. In the case of basic .tpl, we have m15 dotted line and h4 normal line. We have various types of trades: (in a case of a long signal) -Normal line (h4) it's green, and in the 90 zone, dotted line down and turned green. Also good if both are in 90 zone. -H4 line it's green but not up to the 90 zone, and dotted line turns to red to green crossing the h4 line: i think this is the best setup. Risky trades: (in a case of a long signal) -H4 line red and dotted line green. In this case we could wait for the pullback and enter later, anticipating the h4 line. Sometimes the crossing of dotted line with the h4 line can anticipating us the signal of the channel. Just observe the chart and you' ll understand what i mean. All this taking for granted the signals of the channel-ma. Now, imagine a dashboard which control 28 pairs with the basic system (the one on m15) and 28 for the daily with all these filters. We could just take signals and then decide whether it is the case or not to do the trade. " I have no intention to hijack or something like that, just sharing some ideas. You can like it or not, no problem.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi Joseph, out of respect to MM and Damiend, could you please not post this sort of info? its not helpful on a thread that is concentrating on something else.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Yes. This was my last reply regard this type of .tpl. I have posted because people are asking me in pm.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Joseph, introducing a whole new indicator (and repeatedly pushing it onto us, including PM) is confusing and offtopic. This thread is about trading the channel signals, WITHOUT OTHER INDICATORS. I know you mean well, but please share all this in private, let's not make a mix of everything here. Also guys, I'd appreciate if you could share the indicators or other things NOT RELATED TO THIS SYSTEM in private messages, for everyone's benefit. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Would you start a thread of your own? I know that i would follow it and I am sure other people would as well.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
OK,thank you guys,just read through full thread so big thanks to all and work being done by the gurus ! I have just installed ea and all up and running. Something I have noticed regarding the re-entry rule. It will only enter when the initial entry stop loss was too large to place a trade. If we open chart and ea and we missed a Valid entry from earlier,it wont take the trade on a pull back to ema Are these statements correct ? MM ,if that happened to you trading manually would you enter ? If so we would need that to be programmed into ea. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
I think it's not the case, because it will be a copy of two existing threads. In my previous reply you can find all what you need; if you want to go deepen: just contact me, even if any of my ideas are in this thread

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi traders Defenitly not the best week. I had trouble with the EA first two days of the week. Also yesterday haven't got any luck because of news. Anyway, I close another week in green: 100 pips up. Here some of the last trades and results (ignore first day of this week): Attached Image (click to enlarge) Mickey, I follow you, please don't forget to post results of live account. I'm thinking to reduce the basket from 22 pairs to 10-12 maybe. Next week I keep on testing. salut TONI

--- 帖子 #556 ---
sorry to ask same question again, is it 1.2 default? because you sayed 1.1 stop to work mickey and chicago rob testing the 1.2 did good and toni in 1.3 got kicked out most news and finish with +15 profit after all this week in 1.3 i didn't understand demian said if it correct something the entery point based also on some past sl to give more space

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Thanks Mickey for this amazing system! I have a feeling that it should work out well!

--- 帖子 #558 ---
this week i tryed EA + another EA for profits and all was in very good profit until my emotions got out of control and i blew it, because this s&amp;r atheer style if i didn't do it i finished in nice profit

--- 帖子 #559 ---
nice weekend

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Coincidentally, yes. Testing GER30 and GOLD on M1 and M5 at the moment. For my surprise, ger30 on m1 is doing good for now. Too early to judge, but the strategys idea seems to fit for more than just currencys. Renko charts might be worth a try as well.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi Mickey, Damiend Thanks for this great system and EA. A humble request, please bring this goldmine to fruition as soon as possible. I placed the EA on 27 available pairs on two MT4 instances. One produced close to 60% and the other 25% in one weeks trading. On a $6,000 account with 1:400 leverage there were a maximum of ten full contracts running at a given point of time, I.e one full contract per $600. Not exactly what one can do on a live account. Point to note here that the system handled this very well. I would think that one full contract per $2,500 to $3,00 is probably workable and can produce a hefty monthly return. There are improvement possibilities by way of selecting the pairs to trade, not trading during news hours etc. There were times the EA was inadvertently shut down and at others, there were internet issues, possible areas of improvement. Also, difference between the two setups was that for the 60% setup, I used to close all the trades when a 10 to 12 % gain was recorded for a particular run. I did not do this for the other setup, another possible improvement for basket trading. All in all, a great system and a great EA. In relation to Basket trading, I know that it will not be easy for Damiend and will take a lot of time and effort. If you decide to go for it, it will be great. In the meanwhile, can I request you for something that will help me “ manually ” basket trade the EA. A check in your EA so that no new trades are placed if the account balance is 1) above a certain amount 2) when account balance is below a certain amount. These balances to be picked up from global variables. Having these two values as global variables will not need any new input fields for the EA and will not affect the functioning of the EA. Thanks

--- 帖子 #562 ---
After testing it i came to the conclusion that EA is a good idea when you haven't scree-time for don't loss some good trades, but this method gives the best with manual trading and human analisys: this is why i ask here if someone could make also a dashboard who can monitoring 28 pairs + metals, indices, commodities... all if is possible + the daily timeframe; It would be FANTASTIC. I wish you a lot of green pips. Good night guys :-)

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Glad to see your results. One thing though,you will need to recalculate your risk. 1 contract per $2500 with a 40pip stop is running at 16% risk per trade. And your going to have 27 pairs running the ea ! Margin call a whistling in the wind ! I dont know what the chances are of getting half the 27 pairs to have open trades but its something that should be covered. 1% risk per trade might be a good starting point. How many trades do you recall open at any one time ? ive only been running today on 13 pairs as a test and had 4 open trades. Be really really interested to know if you can remember.We can then work out the best risk/reward. Great info !

--- 帖子 #564 ---
As mentioned in the post, ten pairs, could have been twelve. As for risk, at 16 percent calculated by you, that will be the case if each and every pair being traded at that particular instance goes all the way against you, highly unlikely. Also, most of the time, the number of pairs traded at the same time is lower than 10/12 pairs. I would think 6 to 8.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Ok,thanks for the info. unlikely,maybe, but possible. so what happens if we get a bad day... or two. I understand what your saying,but for me on a live account,I would be cutting down the risk. Your results are great and even reducing it down to a manageable risk your still on the way to making it. im using an ea at the moment that increases lot size based on balance,it would be the icing on the cake if that could be programmed in to the ea by damiend and maybe the close all trades at equity increase as you seems to have good results with it.But these are all things for the future. Have a great weekend,looking forward to next few weeks to see how this all develops.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hi, great. I did backtest on M15 and went well. I put on renko but no trade so far, perhaps need to change some settings. good news is that DD is on good level. Appreciate for the developer ! mojepole

Hi, Latest ver available. time M15; set will provide later from my 2nd laptop. mojepole

--- 帖子 #568 ---
So first weeks results are in! 6 major pairs traded, total of 30 trades taken, 9 hit TP and 21 hit SL. I think this week was not the best week for testing with all the news that came out and the EA didn't handle it well, but that being said it could have gone either way if the news had come differently. Not the best performance for me, but I will admit that I made some changes to some settings here and there throughout the week, but nothing drastic. This was a week of testing different scenarios and settings to see what works, and this week I got to see what doesn't work! I've made some further adjustments and will run them next week and see how it goes. I have also thought that if the EA could cross check the higher overall trend before opening a trade it might help to filter some false signals.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Last week results (V1.3, standard settings).. also some funky pairs in the basket

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi mrdfx, I had very similar results to you over the same period, I started on version 1 and updated as soon as an update happened. I lost 3% in the first 4 days and have now got that back to almost breakeven. testing next week again so hopefully we will see some good results.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Thanks Damiend, for all the work that has gone in to DD Channel EA. I had been testing this EA and the results have been good. Few observations, the breakeven is really good and it protects the initial, however profit drops if trailing stop is used I dont see anything wrong with that it works as expected. Will it help if another step similar to breakeven (2nd) is introduced. Could we check how that works, first one will prevent the initial money and second one will give a garanteed return. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Thanks to MickeyMar and other contributors of this thread. I hope you will pardon me for this post because I am grateful to find this thread as I tried to get someone to help in making this system as EA without help. For the purpose of the EA and to quicken the curve of perfection, I think there is Forex Power Pro by Russ Horn which may help in finding a filter for the EA. NB Just added below are 2 indicators as my cross alerters

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Thank you very much for posting the Russ Horn system. It should prove to be a very useful tool.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Damiend, Still new at this, haven't finished the thread yet. You're saying the trade would be opened if the SL is more than 31 pips, which is on the opposite side of the channel?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Here it is, please check on longer time period.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
For everyone that has posted results, thanks for your efforts. One Caveat; We could really use help with an itemized naming convention. i.e.: 1. What Stop Loss &amp; Take Profit are you using? 2. Do you use a Break Evan price trail? 3. Do you use a Trailing Stop? 4. How many entries, per trade do you use. 5. Do you use Specific Trading Hours? Times in GMT Please. 6. Do you use a Specific Closing Time, or Specific Daily Pip Count, etc. With many of the posted results, we are left to guess the answers to at least, some of these questions. Therefore, some posted results are of no use. It's like presenting the response to questions by using some form of unknown language. Just trying to help keep everyone totally informed on the Specifics of what everyone else is doing, to give us all a Common starting point. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Super useful filter, I posted similar before but it was removed for some reason. Will try again.....this keltner channel keeping the EA/manual trader safe in a ranging market. Must use the 40 period Keltner to work. https://www.forexstrategiesresources...nnels-and-ema/

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi I have a request for damien about the next version About the management there are 3 options: - a fix TP and a fix SL - a trailing stop - a TP at opposite signal I noticed sometimes a TP at 40 pips while the trend goes on until more pips So I suggest to open 2 orders to choose the desired option. For instance I can open 0,05 lot with a fix TP and a fix SL and 0.05 lot with a trailing stop or an opposite signal It's a way to optimize the trades.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Darryl, FQ_Custom_Levels_v7 indicator By applying it twice with High Low Bars at 120 and 30, I manually determine my possible TP and SL See the about section of the indicator http://prntscr.com/h70cpu Sorry didnt want to divert the thread

Hi all, thanks to MickeyMar for sharing this strategy and thanks to Damiend for his patient work with EA. I have read all ideas and indications on this thread and I try to give you my little contribution sharing my results on real account from 3 to 6 november... are few trade but fully automated, so may be helpful to improve EA. bye

--- 帖子 #581 ---
hello traders, Best start of the week ever. I'm testing two diferent settings since today before London Open. The usual setings are doing very well. I set the 40 TP/SL but manually modified some SL and BE trades. Finally I've just closed the basket with 134 pips up. I reduce the number of pairs to just 14. But the other settings have been better, awesome: almost 300 pips. I set 120 TP and 40 SL. No BE, neither Trailing stops. Just modified a few SL, and some manually BE. These are the numbers and pairs: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If this was in real account I probably just finish my week here. But I'm demoing, so let's keep on! thank you TONI

--- 帖子 #582 ---
nice toni this is your pairs and 1.2 EA? i used EA to close profit on each pair individual so i ain't loosing at least, but if i kept it run it could be much more maybe it just today very trendy

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Is the Forex Power Pro a strictly 1Hour method? Thanks

--- 帖子 #584 ---
It should work on any time frame.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
He says any time frame, but m5 and m15 might be a little twitchy when you are just learning. Maybe start with H1 or H4 as you ramp up.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
No. This EA is the latest 1.3 version. By the way I've just having an issue. Again same as last week, in one of the platform (I'm testing in two separate brokers platforms) the EA are closing automatically the trades just few seconds after opened. I had same issue last week and as I was unable to fixed the error finally changed to another broker. Now it happens again in this nes broker. So, I guess it has to be an EA bug. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look at this EURUSD sell trade exemple. That happened in opened trades, all closed just in seconds after opened. Don't understand why. Any idea? thank you TONI

--- 帖子 #587 ---
can you post the reduced pairs, cause it seems more than 14

--- 帖子 #588 ---
As an experiment for testing this strategy as a "basket" I have opened a separate demo account with $1000 and opened all 28 major pairs. I'm using my own modified setting that has been working well for me the last few days. I'll let this run for a month to give a good real world test. I'll update you guys weekly on the progress of the account.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Hi Toni, Do you have a log in your Journal tab? I would like to know if the order was closed or if the SL was modified by the EA. Additionally are you using the CloseTradesAtOtherChannelSide or the TakeProfitAtOppositeSignal parameter? These are the only two functions allowed to close a trade therefore if there's a bug it may come from one of these functions. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Thanks to author of the thread for generously sharing his idea, as well as to creator of EA. As proposed system is trend following in it's nature, I would kindly ask for a possibility of adding a "reverse" function which would help to briefly counter trade it in ranging and runaway markets, meaning buying once Ma has crossed lower, and selling when crossed upper channel boundaries. MickeyMar has mentioned that he will not place EURGBP trade during Asian session, what I see as trading opportunity if countertrend traded.. Also we are not immediately taking trades where PA has deeply penetrated our trading channel, but instead waiting for PA to reach MA, what usually happen, and which could actually be our TP target. Hope that my request makes sense! Good trading everyone!

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Sorry Damien!! You were right it was my fault. I forget to close another EA, which I use to close all open trades, that I had it added to other pair. All problems solved yet. Thanks for your help TONI

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Sup guys, market took back much of my live gains using the EA. Well, part of the game. IMHO, SL and TP might be chosen by each pair individual. Depending on pair, SL of 30-40 with a TP of 40-60, which brings a better risk reward ratio as well. The BE is best by default. For now, i had a good trading day on ger30 m1 and m5. M1: 8 Trades, 1 loss, 7 wins - (risk-rewark of 2:1) M5: 2 Trades, 0 loss, 2 wins - (risk-reward of 1:1) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Todays ger30's priceaction was mostly foolproof so i wont judge the results just by one day.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi friend , can u please share ur ger30 setting ?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Using v1.3 with default settings, except using a MAChannelLowShift of 3 and MAChannelHighShift of 3. Manual monitoring still seems like the best way to go with the EA, otherwise the losses equal the profits for a breakeven position. Yesterday was great with about 95 pips, this morning not so good with -107 pips as news decided a different direction than the channel break. Manually closed each of the following rather than letting them go a full -40 pips (though now I'm regretting closing a few since they did end up heading in the right direction LOL!) EURJPY EURAUD AUDJPY GBPUSD CADJPY These two are heading in the right direction for me though: CHFJPY NZDUSD Monday being a no news, trendy day, was fantastic, but after this morning I might shut everything down during the early morning sessions before news and before I can monitor it manually.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Sure, here you go.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
damiend - question here: What is the EA's rule if initial entry failes due too high spread? For example, check this png: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Illustration shows a prevented entry, according to my max spread value. If and when does the EA trigger another entry? If prices moves back to where the initial entry would have happen or just once the spread fits to the max value? Thanks much

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Dtde, Your signal at 17:30 was marked as a delayed entry (I know it because of the vertical line). In this case we don't care about the spread, the delayed entry settings apply. The delayed entry will be opened when the Price will retrace to the signal EMA (more or less, depending of your EA settings)

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I have only enabled from EURUSD to AUDUSD, total 14 pairs. Look the list in the picture. toni

Dear Jagg, I am using this indicator efectively. Espacally it is greta that it alerts only on upper cross of the upper line -on the bar close- or vice versa. I have Keltner &amp; ATR Channel indicator with alert but it alerts each time the price thouches the lines. Do I disurb you if I request from you to make this indicator just like your indicator? Thank you very much in advance. Regrds.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Hi guys, Sorry for my lack of time, I'm not sure I answered to everyone because of that but I read all posts and compute all your suggestions. Attached is a new version 1.4 for the EA with the following changes: Added a check to prevent opening sell orders above the channel and buy orders below the channel, could be useful during high volatility New UseHigherTimeframeTrend (disabled by default). If you set a higher timeframe, it will open trades according to the higher timeframe direction only. The trend check is very simple, it is done with the position of the signal MA versus channel on the higher timeframe : higherTimeframeAllowBuy = (SIGNAL_HIGHERTF &gt; CHANNEL_HIGH_HIGHERTF); higherTimeframeAllowSell = (SIGNAL_HIGHERTF &lt; CHANNEL_LOW_HIGHERTF); New CloseTradesWhenSignalMAInChannel parameter to close the positions when the signal MA goes back into the channel (cross channel low for a Sell, cross chanel high for a buy) A new logging stack (LogsEnabled=true) by default. I added this mainly to log the missed trades, like if the higher timeframe isn't in sync with the signal or if the SL can't be placed on the other side of the channel. It will help you to know why a signal was not traded (the logs are displayed in your Journal tab). I advise you to disable it for backtests though because it's very verbose and will slow down your backtests. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Thanks damiend for the update, with the higher time frame check, which higher time frames is it checking before opening a trade? EDIT: Nevermind I've seen you can select which TF.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thanks Damiend for the update

--- 帖子 #604 ---
+++++++++++++++++++ More difficult work performed. Thanks for that. I would like to know how the "Trade Cancel, when Too Far from Opposite Side of Channel" works. • Is it a fixed number, like 40 from entry? • Can it be controlled, especially on higher time frames? I have been working with how to set up channel trading on other TF's, so having the ability to alter to "Too Far" settings, is a must. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Darryl, The distance that says "order's entry point is too far from the opposite side of the channel" is a fixed pip number, and is the StopLoss value actually. The StopLoss pip value is used for both this control and the regular SL as per original strategy rule. Maybe it would be more flexible to have 2 separate parameter though. Don't hesitate if it's still not clear, I could draw an example on a chart.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Please draw an example on chart to understand better

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Hope I understood you correct... try this please.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
+++++++++++++++ Thanks D. So if I change my trade "Stop Loss" to 50, then My trade will execute even if the distance to the opposite side of channel is 49? Whereas now, if Stop Loss is 40, and distance to opposite side of channel is 41, trade will not trigger. Correct?

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Yes exactly!!

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Ok I hope this picture will clarify for those with didn't understand yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dear Jagg, Thank you very much. It is appreciated... Regards.

This week has not gone well for the basket testing. I'm not sure if it's my settings or just how the market was this week. In my back testing of the settings on multiple currencies it worked well and was profitable but this week its on

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I said we need 3 options: 1/3 order with SL/TP fix 1/3 order with trailing 1/3 order with opposite. So we can optimize. I noticed also SL 40 pips is too big ...it's generally in other side of the channel

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hello everyone! I've been following this thread with interest. Thanks to everyone for their contribution. What madscalp said here touches on what I have been thinking. A realistic TP SL would depend on each pair individually as some have much bigger (or smaller) moves than others so determining and applying parameters based on the volatility of each pair would seem necessary in order for this EA to prove profitable. What would be a reasonable profit for certain pairs, may well turn into a loser due to waiting on the 'across the board TP' to be hit.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
this ea closed all the open trades despite of being tested on demo account with apply to current chart,do you know why?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Agree. Having the same TP and SL for every pair is just not optimal.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I damiend, in your example delayed orders are Sell or Buy order? Thanks

--- 帖子 #620 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Also for dethkult; If you open up the EA, you can optimize settings for each chart to have open. Default happens to be 40 TP, 40 SL. If you don't like 40/40, Change it! To everyone that is newer to this thread, if you plan on trading real money, it is Imperative that you read the thread, take notes and assume the responsibility any job requires.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Oh, already did so. That was towards people who'd expect to have one setting fits all. Different pair, different nature, is all I'm saying.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
First off, I want to thank MickeyMar for your generosity for sharing your system with us.! just like you I have been always fascinated by "MA crossover strategy", and I think you have found great solution filtering out "the noise"!! Thank you also for Damiend for working EA for us! Anyway Damiend, If I may ask, would it be possible to add several option for TP method for future EA updates, I have several thoughts on this, 1. TP/close when price closes below signal line for buy . (and vice versa) 2. TP/close when price closes below "configurable MA", for example, smoothed MA period 10 apply to low for buy (and vice versa) it's great if this can be configurable Thank you and good day!

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Dear Jagg, I am afraid I cannot receive any alerts from this indicator Am I doing something wrong or is there any issue regarding the indicator, please? Thank you in advance. Regards.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Things seem to be turning around on my $1000 account 28 pair basket test. The first week was bad and I thought the account would blow, but this week almost all the pairs seem to be trending just right and the account is almost recovered.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Thank you to MM for sharing his ideas and methodologies. I have been trading the Stairstep Breakout method for a few years while also working on a method similar to the one presented here. I have found that the signal line break of the channel and the breakout on the SSBO system are pretty close together and usually yield good trades. I offer a couple of observations from my research. In my research, I use a 55 ema channel and either a 9, 13, or 21 ema close - depending upon volatility and my risk tolerance that day. I do not suggest that this is a better setup than MM's use of the 33 ema. Each must make a system their own and this just happens to be the way I like it. One of the tools that I have used to filter out some of the false breakouts is an ADX. I like to see the ADX line above 22 or 25, and increasing. i.e. the value of the ADX on the signal candle should be higher than the previous candle, and above 25. Since the ADX is indicating the strength of the current trend move, I am only interested in the ADX line, not the D+ or D- lines. If the ADX requirement is not met on the signal candle, I consider the conditions for the next two candles. If the ADX goes above 25 and the signal is still beyond the channel, I consider this a valid trade. If the ADX does not go above 25, I consider the signal failed and wait for another one. Attached is a quick screen shot showing the 55 ema Channel with a 13 ema close signal line. I scrolled back a few days and placed lines of potential trades. At point 1, the trade is not taken because the ADX is below 25. However, two candles later, at point 2, the ADX is above 25 and the trade is now taken. At point 3, the ADX is below 25, indicating a weak move. So the trade is not taken. At point 4, the signal has crossed, the ADX is above 25 and is rising. the trade is valid. Perhaps this ADX filter could be helpful in this method.

Thank you Tpc23 for sharing observations from your research here. With the ADX, your system seems to be very impressive. When I scrolled back, I saw some good profitable trades. I tried with the 3 EMAs combined and found out that when the 3 EMAs crossed, a good move is on its way. Hope to hear more from you. TQ

What a turn around for the week! The first week the account took a huge knock, but this week it has recovered very nicely, and looking set for some good profits. Still 2 weeks to go to finish the 1 month basket test. Let see how it goes.

Thank you for your ADX input - a very strong tool indeed Here is an excellent presentation complimenting your input

we missed MickeyMar and Damiend?

Defininitely y're right. Most probably lack of time. I've started with a UsD 10,000 account 3 weeks ago with 8 pairs. Result this morning: usd 9,933. all default settings. must be adapted individually, of course still experimenting. Running the updated version DD1.4 / 24 hours. I have also tried 5min / 3O / 60 min with other brokers. The results are very negative so far.

with some buystop and sellstop perhaps this EA can works good, but................

Dear Mickey, on Nov 3rd, post 542, you published settings for DD-channel-MA-1.2 that you wanted to trade live. 20 days are over: which are the results? The same settings, backtested on the last four years, make it difficult to believe that you were able to make a living out of this system. What is the main difference between your profitable way of trading this system and the way it is traded by the EA's produced by the wonderful damiend (congratulations for the coding from a coder!)? I became curious about your thread because, before discovering it, I was coding, by myself, a quite similar logic, which unfortunately I did not manage, yet, to make profitable. And I was looking for hints. Your initial post looked very promising. Can you identify what you are manually making differently from what a "dry" mathematical algorithm is rinsing and repeating? Thank you so much in advance.

So 21 days have passed with the monthly basket test, and I thought things were coming back nicely last week, but today has been a bad start. There's still 1 more week to go before the 1 month test is completed. One thing I've learned during this test is that it's not suitable for basket trading as each pair behaves differently so each would require different settings to "optimize" them to the strategy. I think perhaps sticking to 6-10 pairs max and tailoring the settings to suit each pair would work better, using the same setting for each pair has not worked well. Lets see how the rest of the month plays out, currently 3 weeks gone and the account is at -33%.

you're absolutely right. my 15 minutes of trading with only 8 currency pairs only has recovered slightly to 9153 but then losses again. so still a total loss overall starting with 10,000. It is interesting to note that the 30 minutes trading (everything with standard settings) I am in a small profit! Generally speaking, I've had only bad experiences with moving averages eg Puria (other concept with 13 pairs, other standard averages (75-85-5). Even after 5 months in a loss. The idea is good and plausible but the practical implementation is negative as a result.

i get the CK alerts,BUT nothing show, no lines 0 blank ,is that the way for the CK _

No one using this for intraday? Or, at all? Damiend, I'm putting 0 pips on delayed entry, but it opens the trade immediately after arrow appears. Does 0 mean cancel delayed entry, and I should've put 1 instead?

I love the ADX filter to this method. My problem is the exits... When are you exiting? Because I feel that the recross back over the MA lines is too much profit given back.

Hello all! To sumarize the results after more than three weeks gone: I've started with a UsD 10,000 account and 8 pairs. Results today: usd 10,004.59. Well not a loss (some losses in between) but not for living. all default settings. must be adapted individually, of course Running the updated version DD1.4 / 24 hours. I have also tried 5min / 3O / 60 min with other brokers. Completely a nonsense as no surprise. not meant to be.

Ok guys the time has come! After 1 month of running my basket test with this strategy I can finally share my results. First off just to recap, I traded all 28 pairs 24/5 with slightly modified settings from the original. It's been an interesting month to follow the account up and down. Total results after 1 month of trading are: Starting balance: $1000 Trading size: 0.05 Final balance: $643 Total profit/loss: -$357 Total profit/loss percent: -35.7% So overall the basket test was not very successful. I did learn that having the same settings for each pair is not the way to go, and they all need their own optimized individual setting, so this goes to say that using this strategy for basket trading is not really recommended. I do believe that there is potential with this strategy, we just need to test and find what works best. Thanks and green pips to you all.

Thanks for the update mrdfx.

Good morning MM. Hope all is well with you. Although I have my own way of trading your method peeked my interest. For the most part never been a fan of MA's, but I have trader friends that use them &amp; they seem to do well. What peeked my interest was the way the MA's handle the choppy consolidating times we are faced with in trading. The MA"s you have chosen offer the trader the opportunity to stand aside &amp; not be lead into trading in the wrong direction during the choppy times. I have watched numerous times price start to travel against me casting doubt as to whether I should close the trade only to see price return to its original direction going on to produce a winning trade. I know NOTHING IS 100% &amp; this is NO EXCEPTION, but it sure increases your odds of being on the right side of a trade. This method is simplicity at it best. Concise &amp; for the most part clean on the chart. I HAVE NOT traded this method on a LIVE ACCOUNT only in demo, but the results I have so far are very impressive. I have traded for many years &amp; have developed my own method to this madness call trading, but I will begin trading this method on a small live account in January. The method - system is simple to understand, but its up to each individual trader as to how they use it. I wish you the best with the method &amp; your thread. ________________________________

I' m using it on daily tf with analysis (clearly), and works good (+1600 pips live account in 32 days and i'm not a professional trader) But it could be better with a very simple dashboard who monitor every timeframe from m15 and advise us with an "up arrow" when the signal is coming: like this we can't loss any signal and we should just check and doing our analysis. For example for intraday, take longs only if we have 2 up arrows also on m30 and h1.. I'm saying it from the beginning of the thread but no one has taken in consideration my idea. The people just want to sleep/do other things except the trading, and make millions without doing nothing.

Hi, Joseph95, I am working in M15 tf and the results are not very good. I was thinking to trade in higher time frame to see the difference in result. can you explain it more in simple words please.

Hello again everyone, First of all my apologies for not being able to reply to all of you guys who wrote to me over the past year with ideas or results after trading this method. I haven't visited FF for a while now, been pretty busy with various other personal projects, but I am still trading and still using this system. I found from your messages and some of the posts that most of the traders happy with the strategy are the discretionary traders, those who use the system with at least a pinch of manuality - which is also what I learned in my experience with it. Autotrading it did not work for me, although I haven't tried much (just used for some time the EAs you guys so generously shared here, mostly on demo). Thanks again for all the work and sharing your experiences. I've continued to use this system in my private trading with good results - which is frankly all I ask for from my trading. I haven't had spectacular gains because I trade part time, but the system has been keeping me at break even when the market's choppy and winning when there are good rallies. I continue to think that this is a good manual system, one that keeps the trader safe and gives good direction and entries - but only a trader's eye can feel market volatility, timing, and apply correct money management. I am thinking of sharing a kind of a journal on this system here in this thread - documenting the manual entries and the results on the system in manual (live) trading. Please let me know if that would be useful to anyone. Also if you guys have any other ideas related to the system that I can help with, I'd be happy to. Cheers everyone and happy pipping!

How it works automatically ؟؟؟؟؟؟ Do you need pressure TRADE NOW

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi MickeyMar, I would like you to post that journal of yours if the offer is still on the table. I got interested in this strategy and going to check it. you were showing examples of USDJPY but what pairs do you mostly focus on? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Yes, i can see good idea behind this system. Can you please add martiangle in the ea? after a lose trade it will increase lot size using martiangle. thanks.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I guess to differentiate between good and bad signals one should consider the slope of the signal line when it breaks out of the channel. If the slope is weak it would signal a choppy market to avoid...

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Anyone who is still using this strategy can you please tell me if it’s still profitable or share more new findings to add on this strategy.
