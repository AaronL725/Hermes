This is very simple. It's there on all time frames. Can see it with naked eye. Can be applied in many ways. The implications are breathtaking. These are the crumbs that big money leaves for us. In words: Bullish setup: 1. Candle 1 paints. 2. Candle 2 breaks 1st candle's high and closes bullish (usually). 3. Candle 3 dips below 1st candles high and the goes up above it. Picture: Daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Zoom into Hourly: Attached Image (click to enlarge) if you want to refine your entry, you can do it to any zoom level. Here see the check marks the setup and arrow marks the entry. Fibs indicate one way to manage. This thread is making history! We have our first baby: FLASH SETUP! https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...3#post14879473 If you're looking for holy grail, don't stop looking. But you won't find it in trading systems, indicators, expert advisors, signal services, gurus, furus, whatever. Those are just tools (and fools). Holy grail is inside of you. You need to understand yourself, understand what's stopping you from seeing clearly, from making the right decisions. You need to solve your riddle. Only then you'll see what tools suit you, and which fools are useful. Then trading will become effortless. Many people on FF and other forums hate, slander and persecute those who succeed. They demand proof, they demand records, they demand step by step. They hate because they feel that there's something very hard that needs to be done before they succeed: and that is change themselves. You'll have to change.

Thank you! Your Fib-tool is cool. Never thought about this way.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Can you kindly go into more detail on refining your entry at the H1? I'm a tad lost there. Thank you in advance!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
could you upload a picture for the bearish trade? also, what are the TP and SL?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
what’s the logic or implications of the market here? yes it’s a pattern, but why is this pattern happening?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
If you like trading, that means you have predator mind. Predator's eye instantly zeroes in on a point of pain, on a point of weakness. I will post explanation later, but for your exercise, find these setups on Daily chart, and then see where the wick bounced on H1 or M15.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I understand that you wish to simplify. Pattern is painted but the reasons are many, depending on context. However, I'll provide additional conditions where the pattern probability increases. For your exercise, look for pattern right AFTER the tops or bottoms occur and keep looking for it BEFORE a top or bottom is broken.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I marked bullish and bearish patterns connecting three candles with green and red. The SL depends first two candles, on what third candle touches and how it develops. About TP. You see, you can be precise about your entry and SL because they are in the past. Price has painted them for you. TP cannot be precise because it is in the future. My goal is to hold at least to EOD, or even to EOW, but preserve capital and keep some profit if it fails, that's why I have HALF and BE in my management. YOUR TP can be anything you wish. It can a FIB, it can be a near TOP/BOTTOM, it can be a multiple of your SL. It's personal.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
It's everywhere. Open your mind.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Must Candle #2 close above/below Candle #1's high/low?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
every system looks great in hindsight when you know where the "bottom" is.. cant wait to see some live charts!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Not a simplification, but a contextual explanation

--- 帖子 #13 ---
It's better that it does, then the setup is easier to find.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
It's easy to see the bottom develop. It starts with a fractal. But then you sit on your hands thinking that you're late. This is how you get in.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
If it’s all so subjective and variable, then how can we ever test it to discover factually whether or not it’s profitable for us?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I believe I supplied some options. This is not a signal service. I will explain what I do in my trades.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I love simple systems based on candles, set and forget, and this is one and for this reason I have subscribed and will follow this thread. Pease let me to understand: what mean EOD and EOW? Secondly: the enter for long is at the high of the second candle, once his high and low are both higher than the first candle? Some examples in the picture are not pretty clear. Clearly the SL may be the low of first candle and R:R may be 1¨2. For those who can follow faster tf, they can get better entries. Waiting for your next posts.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Let's look at BTCUSD. I marked second candle. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The third candle didn't bounce. But there's a setup there. Once second candle paints it's time to look for setup. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Zoom in to one hour. Second arrow marks the point of departure. See, it's a second candle again. And see, price bounced on return there. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Actually, this is the bounce of 3rd candle off 1st candle high/low. To refine the entry, we can zoom in to what happens in 1st and 2nd candle. Or just use the wick of 3rd candle. Rectangle marks the area of interest. EOD is the end of day, close of daily candle, and EOW is end of week, close of weekly candle.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Actually you gave me an idea. And I'll name this setup after you. Flash Setup. And it's really simple. Bullish setup: 1. 2nd candle breaks 1st candle high and closes near high. 2. 3rd candle dips below 1st candle high and bounces above 2nd candle high. 3. Entry is 2nd candle high. SL is 3rd candle low, and TP is 2:1 or EOD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Bearish setup: 1. 2nd candle breaks 1st candle low and closes near low. 2. 3rd candle rises above 1st candle low and bounces below 2nd candle low. 3. Entry is 2nd candle low. SL is 3rd candle high, and TP is 2:1 or EOD. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #21 ---
In summary, your strategy assumes that after the second candle, for example bullish, the third follows the same trend. The rest is to confirm the entry for example with a pullback with a needle on the Fibonacci on the second candle, or between the first and second candle, confirm it and close everything at the close of the third candle or even higher. But it happens that since the market is more lateral than trendy, after the second candle the market reverses and takes the SL or even worse with a sudden movement of high volatility. I believe that we need to be ready for a reversal and enter a reverse trend. If the second candle is a pin candle, it can be dangerous to trade. The strategy is good, but it needs to be perfected.

Recent drop on gold: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let's see if we could refine it: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Yes, it was H&amp;S, and the entry was hooked to original point of departure to break 1st candle low. Red rectangle is the entry, and SL if you wish.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Le CAC, or FRANCE40 did a little drop there: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Where would we get in? Let's look at H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It's H&amp;S again. Check is the origin of the move. Rectangle is where price should bounce.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Price keeps bouncing and I could take off half already at 100% but I only put 0.01 lots. Perhaps it reaches TP below 300%

This setup is in the family of Three White Soldiers and Three Black Crows. Allthough theese require long bodied candles. I I never found the time to use that strategy, but I think now is it for me. It is clear to me, that used together with trend lines this is a perfect bounce setup. In matter fact if you had a Dash Board continuesly looking for this pattern at all 28 Forex pairs, then you would get many opportunities for bounce setups to choose from every day. In a Long setup: Find this pattern at bounce of trend line. (Or some MA that can be used as bounce wall). Conservative SL on the low of bar 1. More risky on low of bar 2. BE at 1:1 and let the rest run using Trend Magic. Nice thread!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I am thinking of creating a dashboard. Working on specs.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Volume is important together with this setup.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
When looking for refinement, the patterns I choose are usually on high volume because they involve some kind of shakeout or strong movement. So I don't need to see volume. It is there.

This is exactly like the ICT concept Immediate Rebalance Here's a fully coded indicator with HTF options available as well https://www.tradingview.com/script/A...lance-LuxAlgo/

Thanks D! . The strategy is interesting. Subscribed!. Considering the fact the all charts and TF are fractals, appreciate if you can please share you thoughts for scalping. intra-D variation. Attach is illustration of 2 trades on XAU today on H1 as main TF and M5 as entry TF. 1. Entry Taken on BO of M5 Resistance Candles. 2. SL on Recent M5 Swing Low. 3. TP 2RR for both trades (Can be H1 Resistance Level).

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I know about this, and I don't want to get into arguments about stealing shit from ICT.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yes, this is good stuff. The points of departure are obvious. Also look at candle 4. The break of candle 3 was rejected and again you can see your entry point for scalp short.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
That makes good sense, especially when you think that Huddleston has stolen all of ICT’s shit (including the parts he has tried to take credit for inventing) from other, much older stuff anyway. Some of the Wyckoff stuff he’s relabeled is now over 100 years old.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I don't claim to invent anything. Just pointing out a simple pattern. Third candle bounce happens. Sometimes it doesn't. The pattern is not a system. The system is creating rules about when pattern should work. That's why I go into refinement in LTF. Also since the pattern is fractal, it makes sense to create a dashboard that shows it on multiple timeframes to increase confidence and to catch it on multiple instruments.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
BUY SETUP: In the end we always have TO WAIT for "3rd candle dips below 1st candle high and bounces above 2nd candle high". ONLY THEN we can place the buy stop which is on the 2nd candle high. By this way it is necessary to switch to faster time frames to catch the pullback. For example from D1 to H1; H4 to M30. Do I have understand right? I have seen that sometime the trend is so strong that it doesn't come back to pick the high of the first candle. Many occasions of trading are loosed. It is not a critic. Only observation.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
hi @d5400 Good trading method and is profitable with proven money management strategy for entries and exits. This is one of my trade setup entries which I traded since 2018. If you are looking MTF Fractals you can consider @FerruFX' Fractals until you develop your own dashboard. here&gt; https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ard-indicators USDCAD May28, we have a fractal high ... that's the swing high on Daily Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Thank you sir, for visiting my thread. Your influence is on many of my favorite traders. I respect FerruFX very much and would seek his help with my dashboard when I figure out the specs for it.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
d5400, thank you for sharing this method. Please find attached a simple indicator to markup the candles. -The diamond means the 2nd candle is a HH or LL. The second candle is to be the same direction as first in this version of indicator (can be changed later). This occurs in realtime as current candle fulfils the rule. Then we wait for the rule below to be fulfilled. -The arrow means candle 3 low of high is lower / higher than the candle 1. -Obivously there will be situations where 2nd candle is a HH or LL but the 3rd candles does not meet the rules. So need to wait for the arrow to appear. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have not incorporated the 3rd candle being a HH or LL yet; await feedback. Looks like some filters are needed. This is a starting point and the indicator can be developed further. regard, R. Attached File(s) 3rdCandleBounce_v1.ex4 15 KB | 202 downloads

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thank you, developing specs continues. Here's the chart where I marked third candles. Crosses mark candles that are not considered because they open on the other side of the 1st candle wick and never reach it. I also marked inside bars. An inside bar marks the mother bar before it, and any bar after that is considered inside bar until it breaks mother bar. Checks mark the candles that follow outside bars and reach the 1st candle wick from the right direction. Safe entries are from the 1st candle wick. For long, third candle needs to enter 1st candle upper wick from above, and for short, enter lower wick from below.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
1) Second candle needs to break previous candle, or mother bar. If this is an outside bar, then it broke both directions, but further rules may filter one direction out. 2) Safe setup: Third candle opens above or inside upper wick of 1st candle to long setup. Third candle opens below or inside lower wick of 1st candle for short setup. 3) Aggressive setup: Third candle reaches upper wick for long setup, reaches lower wick for short setup.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let's see if I did right.

That worked just off 1st candle high. On M15 there was H&amp;S

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Clearly by working on lower TFs it is possible to find better income. Be patient please. What means H&amp;S ?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Head and Shoulder, Quasimodo

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Quasimodo is a very convenient setup for refinement. Recently a bunch of setups breaking daily highs/lows on M15 were quasis.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thank you for the explaination. Is it correct that the thrid candle open must be above / below 2nd candle close?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi, I am practicing. I have highlighted what I think are 3rd candles that meet the criteria. Criticism welcome.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Where did you get that indicator with the large candles?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This is not simple. There is another word starting with "s" character. Let me ask you a question. What candles are? Candles came from Japan. There was a market of rice. Why it worked? Because the volume of the rice was about the equal each year. And what candles now? One candle has 1$ inside, next 1m$. So what you are trying to compare and what magic must happen to let it work for you? You can create simple script that will check your magical setups and then you will see that it has max 47% winrate and never more. Why 47%? Because all you need is 51% to be profitable, but that 4% are fees, spread, slippage, red news, weekends, fat finger issues, greed, fear and all the other stuff that works against you and for the broker. Casino never lose.

3rd candle open is above/below 1st candle close

--- 帖子 #56 ---

--- 帖子 #57 ---
If 1st candle wick is non-existent, then it's body has to be considered. 1st. and 2nd. don't have to be bullish together, but 2nd candle has to be bullish to create a bullish setup, as long as 3rd candle opens above 1st candle close.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Sorry, "as long as 3rd candle opens above 1st candle close"... Do you mean 1st candle's close or 1st candle's HIGH (for bullish)?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Above high is too strict of a requirement. Can miss a lot of setups. But it does seem like a safer bet.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I tried on demo the system and what happens in that frequently the third candle already lose his force and the price comes back closing in loss, or at the contrary the trend is so strong that doesn't pick the high of the first candle and goes on without to open trades. Il you close in the day, you can make only very few pips because the force is already going in exhaustion. It depends by lucky. Or you do work also in minor timeframes to take advantage of configurations to anticipate the entries, as you have already shown, or the results will be weak.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Results so far. I had to manage average some trades, had to close some in loss. This is just from looking at weekly and daily candles at the start of the week and looking for H4/H1 setups

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Do I interprete this right - You take trade at different pair in exactly same secund. You must use a robot???

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Please note I placed limit orders at the start of the week. So It's possible they executed at the same time. No robot yet. I wish.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Oh, I did not understand that. I can make a robot. Interested??

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Testing TF M5 with entries on M1

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Yes, very much. Let's see what ideas dashboard gives us.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Very nice. If you could show a chart that would be great too.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
No, I am not an expert in Dashboards. If you have an exact way to trade, I can copy that in a robot. That would be: At week opening find the pairs that are a subject to trade. The robot needs to know exactly how it is done in order to copy it. And it must be based on rules. The robot will then look for the setup in lower TF during the week and set the Limit orders, when setups appears. The charts will be coloured in accordans to the status, so that it is easy to follow the pairs in their work. No#1 - selecting pairs to trade, can be done manually and fed into the robot. But it is best if some kind of rule can be coded into the robt, because then consistancy can be obtained. So this will not be a dashboard, but a fully automated robot.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
We can then use the robot in demo and refine it at we go.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I normally colour the background of the pairs so I can easy overview if the pair is loaded to take a trade, or have taken a trade and in which direction the trade is.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Obviously position management plays a big role. But how about something for you to bite into? Bullish setup, (reverse for short.) 1) choose two timeframes, HTF, say M30 and LTF, say M5. 2) Wait for HTF [2] to close above high of [1] 3) Wait for HTF [3] to touch [1] high 4) On LTF wait for a candle to close above high of a candle. Enter on that candle's close. TP/SL your choice . Trading hours, trading days of week, your choice. Etc.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
If somebody do works only up one or two cross with two different time frames he can get good results. I am trading with Mini ìndice Ibovespa because I am in Brasil. Look at the graphic on M60 and M30. It was not easy due high volatility: I have had to wait on M30 the price to go down the white line. EMAs 18 and 9 confirmed the tendence.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Very good. BTW there was Flash setup on M30

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Sure. I will make a shot for this to have a robot ready for monday. BUT - it is vital for any robot, that it has been helped by working in the right main set up from start. That is what you did in post #62. Looking into weekly and daily candles to decide which pairs to trade and in which direction. If we just put on the robot blindly, then we can be sure of losing. See post #61. So I want people to find the crystal ball which tells the direction of the next daily candle. That is the key to succes.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I marked third candle of flash setup. Sometimes third candles follow each other.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
You don't need to know up front the direction. You just need to know that setup is currently valid on HTF. Then you can look for setups on LTF. Here's a less than ideal setup on daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We know it's working when 3rd candle is below 1st low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) While setup is valid you look for LTF setups. Can you find LTF 3rd candle bounces SHORT in yellow square? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Is it too easy to say that all we need is to wait two candles in the same direction, then a third contrary candle (retracement) and to enter again in the same direction? Is it not the 1-2-3 price scheme? What is important is that there is a strong spine on the contrary candle that reject the previous level and confirm the original tendence.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Yes, rejection engulfing candle is one variation. But same direction candles also work as long as their highs or lows are near each other.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Here is the Flash from post #20. 1. 2nd candle breaks 1st candle high and closes near high. 2. 3rd candle dips below 1st candle high and bounces above 2nd candle high. 3. Entry is 2nd candle high. SL is 3rd candle low, and TP is 2:1 or EOD. I really do not need to work in different TF's as I see it. (I can - it's a bit more complicated). Situation is this. (Setup for long trade) 1. We are on third candle. The last candle has broken the high of the candle before it. "Near" is subjective and does not work in a computer. A numbwer of pips must be chosen. 2. We are still on the third candle - it is ongoing. Now price has fallen below 1st candle high. Exactly when price fall below 1st candle high - I set a limit order on 2nd candle high. OK? I do not have to change to a lower TF. The price is the same at all TF's. This is a case of a few minutes work for me. I just want a confirmation that I am right. When I code a robot I always make it possible for people to get an alarm in stead of the robot taking the trade.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Sure, "close enough" I usually define as percentage of ATR. That can be a parameter. Distance between 1st and 2nd candle highs or lows is the filter defined as ATR percentage, let's say 25%.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
OK. Let me start then with what I have described, and then we can add this ATR filter later on. Just so that we get going. I will do this today.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
First sign of the robot trading. Using M1 to get some signals to test. Just to show that we are getting there guys. I will test some more.

Can you give me some settings that work? It's not placing trades for me in tester.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Remember that it is a requirement that the robot is trading WHILE the candle is ongoing - not at the close of the candle. Therefore you must use "Every tick" model. Could this be the problem?

--- 帖子 #86 ---

--- 帖子 #100 ---
We analyze three candle configurations. Necessarily we make a choice for short or long bias. And then either trade blindly and hope our choice is right or we look for signs that confirm our choice. First two candles decide our bias. And we look at the third candle for the entry. We can look at LTF and HTF for more information. There's a limited number of three candle configs but still it's pretty big. So I devised a code to describe them. I'm going to post some configurations and their codes. I'll post the legend later but for your entertainment you can try to guess what the letters stand for.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
As usual, it does need an encryption machine to translate your impossible-to-understand acronyms. Anyway, thank you for your job. She must have taken a long time to make the drawing. I appreciate it, but my impression is that in any configuration all we have to do is wait for the second candle to break the low of the first candle in case of a bearish trend and place a sell limit order and a buy limit order on the high of the first candle in case of an uptrend and let's hope that it goes well. Stop Loss at the opposite of the first candle, but it may be a big stop loss if the candle is high. The strategy is much simpler than it seems, but only by moving subsequently in shorter times safer income can be achieved as you have already pointed out in previous publications. But in this way we lose the possibility of a set and forget strategy which would be very good for those who cannot spend a lot of time in front of the computer. The weak part of this method is that it does not take into account the strength of the trend. Many times it is already too late, especially with long candles and the price, by rebound, goes back towards the stop loss. Going long back in time I remember that this is not a new strategy and those who shared it also used moving averages and were more selective in choosing the movement, not a whatever pullback on the minimum or maximum. I believe that you may add a filter such as a simple pair of moving averages that confirm the trend with settings suitable for the time frame you want to operate. I use EMA 18 and 9. Others 12 and 6 for long times. It is only a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I agree that at it's core it's a simple system..and lets keep it that way. Similar to how the Magic100 system identifies it's trend, we could do the same here. Don't overthink it and just a simple moving average with a period of 100 to make sure we're in a clear trend, or simply just use your eyes.

Yes, that's one way to keep it simple. Maybe RiskFighter stops ignoring me and comes back to create a robot on these principles. Come back RF! I was too harsh, but that's reality. I was having a bad day. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I was having a bad day. everyone does pal. the important thing is to comeback from it and dont dwell..... always better weeks ahead

--- 帖子 #106 ---
This is what acronyms stand for. You won't find them in Oxford dictionary . First two candles decide the setup, long or short. Then We want to trade in the direction of the third candle. Third candle will move and hit some lines. Current state of third candle is the configuration, and the code describes current state of where the third candle is now and what it did in the direction we wanted it to go. That means if the setup is long, we record what it did for the long side, same thing for short.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I simplified the code. Made it numeric. It's more to the point now. The point is that each candle has 4 lines OHLC. These lines can be crossed and they can be crossed back. We count lines depending on our setup. For longs we count lines beginning with High, and for shorts from Low. We can enter 1 line and exit, then it's 1/1. If we enter 2 lines, and exit one, then its 1/2, one of two. If we blow through a candle on the other side, then it's 4. But if we blow it and return to the wick, then it's 1/4. If we don't reach line 1, then it's 0.

That's nice visual. Good job.

It is on demo. I just blindly followed the rules as at the beginning of the thread in graph D1. I only placed an order on the low or high of the first candle after the second candle surpassed them by going up or down. I don't have followed the other timeframes to confirm the entries. I just let it go. The strategy must be improved by defining SL and TP, any loss recovery method; or close everything when it reaches an overall SL or TP value.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or the lines via RebelAnt3CR (Pic2). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here I'm not sure whether candle counting is still the basis for the decision .

RebelAnt3cr is a nice indicator, but it's different from 3cb. The biggest difference is that 3cr is a reversal, and 3cb is a continuation.

Just a suggestion, i think that this strategy would be ideal for EAX dashboard (there is a thread here on FF https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-dashboard-eax ) Idea is to incorporate any indicator in fully functional Dashboard as a signal provider and let the dashboard do the rest from the trading side. This could save time in developing the dashboard since there is fully functional free dashboard which is working for years based on customer indicators as triggers. Basically piece of the code needs to be added in any indicator to become readable buffer for the dashboard and a trigger.

becareful on gold, previous signals was not so efficient, if i understand well... to simplify the method, if you see 2 blue candle, the third must be blue to make profit in most case (not exactly true, price must go down to enter and then must go above open of the high of the first) ! sometimes it works, 3rd candle close up, sometimes few pips can be done before price go south: hard to know when you must just scalping little pips or let candle close .

if(Low[i] &lt; High[i+2])// Don't continue if(High[i] &gt; High[i+1] &amp;&amp; Close[i+2] &gt; Open[i+2] &amp;&amp; Close[i+1] &gt; Open[i+1] &amp;&amp; Close[i+2] &lt; Close[i+1] &amp;&amp; Low[i] &lt; High[i+2] )

--- 帖子 #246 ---
We need to anticipate what we want to happen. We want High[i] &gt; High[i+1] to happen, but we need to prepare for it when Low[i] &lt; High[i+2]. So let's draw the line when we see Low[i] &lt; High[i+2]. Anyway, your condition describes three soldiers: three candles in one direction. There are other patterns for 3cb, and other lines that third candle bounces off, not just high/low. We'll get to that later.

The line has to be marked on the high or the low of the candle, not at the close. Obviously, if the spike is short, there is not so much difference, but a long spike does it.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
gj potential buy.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Yes, if high/low is near the close, the price may want to go there, but if the wick is large, the price may not reach the close.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
But you could have been short a couple of candles before, right?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
1. i do not see any rejection candle in h1 to short. 2. if you short, you are not following the higher time frame direction.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I am not sure. I see a short on the daily with the same system.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Yes that's my logic if lets say difference between wick high or low and body close is 10 pips, i will put it on body close because ( insert here any reason you can think of, but in short its a magnet for price). I am still experimenting, but in case of JPY pairs i would love to put as much distance as possible, since they will eat my sl easily if its a a crazy day. Just for the record bunch of orders this week didnt reach the body close but they reached the wick high or low, and i missed those opportunities, so FlashPaul has right, on the other hand i want this to be boring as much as possible methodology and i don't want to be in the trade all the time and i dont want to feel the adrenalin rush.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
It should be interesting to follow these weekly opportunity in D1 and H4.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
This system also suggests looking for a refinement entry along with higher timeframe direction. Although we see a break short on the daily, the source of that movement can be quite far up the candle. So I actually would look to go long to that level.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Although the long term trend on this pair is currently obvious, it's not often the case in Forex. I like to make sure setups applied mechanically have a positive expectancy, even a slight one, and then apply a bias on it. Otherwise, it would be one of those thousands and thousands of systems here with subjective rules, changed every day that gives negative expectancy in real trading in live accounts. If we would have to apply the long term obvious bias, there would be no added value to a simple stochastic oscillator or a MA crossover.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
then if your set up comes from d1, then one has to become aware that it is counter trend trade, when compared to one or two time frames higher. nothing wrong with that as long as one is aware of this situation of a lesser probability trade, and being consistent with your own trade set up.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Everything's an average, even the candle. Everyone has their own view on the market. I'm not looking for mechanical rules. I look for opportunities. Third candle bounce shows one way to look for opportunities.

hi ! Nice result, can you detail the entry model you’ve used. There is already several way to trade the strategy on this thread

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi David, The entry was as described on the first page, the only difference was that i ignored setups if the wick of the first candle covered the second candle, and if the difference of the body and the wick was less then 15 pips on average i would place limit order on the closing of the first candle. But these were the small changes, all in all keep the rules from the first page as guidance. Everything else will come with practice and previous experience. The idea was to have mechanical system with minimum 2:1 ratio, and simple set and forget....i almost managed to do it, since i moved some trades to BE...regrettably. All in all it was profitable trading week.

Hello, EURGBP D timeframe, if i understand well, it is now developing the third candle, since i don't have time during the day to watch the charts, i can put a buy order at the level of second candle high with sl at the level of the second candle low. RIght? I understood that the refining using lower tf is better option, but since i cannot, i would like to ask 2 questions: 1) is it this one (chart attatched) a good setup, and now we are waiting for the third candle? 2) can i use JUST daily tf without using smaller TF? Thanks very much i really like it Mirko

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Subscribed! One question: some broker use the daily and 4 HR candle that start (and end) at different time than others, example Activtrades uses London time for the start of the daily and 4 hour candle, but if markets use new York time for the start of those candles. So for example while with Activtrades I have a setup, with ic markets I don't have it, because the charts have different daily and 4 HR candles,I hope I am clearing explaining the issue. Is this discrepancy a problem? Thanks Okrim

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I never have problem with different brokers. If your trading method is sensitive with candle stick formation, you need to backtest again using your particular broker. My opinion: sensitive methodology won't be good for long run, it will get confusion to the users.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
do not use the sunday candle per your chart. it distorts your view. it is not a full day candle. compare with other brokers like fxcm , ic markets ......... as for myself and for good measure, i prefer the 2nd candle to close above/below the 1st candle high/low. if you use d1 as entry time frame, remember to check one or two time frames higher for direction.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
you have to make do with what your broker has. or keep on comparing with other brokers. they all use their own servers, with different times starting the day and are different from one another. what the brokers offer you are CFDs. they whether forex, metals, commodities, indices, all differs from actual pricing from the Exchange. if you want standardization, trade the futures which only shows what the one Exchange shows, just like there is only one Dow Jones Stock Exchange.

Refinement is still an option for entry, since you already can see where the breaking move started. That'll reduce your DD, but you can also miss the setup if price doesn't reach LTF entry.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
IMO, ideally, the 2nd candle closes above/below the 1st candle's high/low. I prefer a limit order at the 1st candle's high/low on a retracement, with a stop loss above/below the 2nd candle's high/low. But it's better to hear from those who are more experienced with the strategy.

gj long result

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Thanks everyone for answering, very kind. In the box, about your trade, very good, but just to understand about your gj long, you enter late, because the setup was three candles back or I am wrong? See attached image thanks!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
d1 is not my set up time frame. it is my directional time frame. it tells me that previously at that level price shot up. so if price came back to the same level again it may some how find that kind of support also. my set up was in the lower time frames where one uses it to refine entries. you see it is all fractals. the big time frame and the small time frame have around the same level. what is your reaction when i say h3 is my entry time frame, then it is all perfect right? trading is not like precise science or math where a level is determined by a single straight line. trading is more like art where a level is using a big paint brush drawing across a zone.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I say "amazing!", and I thanks you for your insights and inspiration. Now I understand, please provide more chart and information if you want. Cheers Okrim

Yes nice, let see how it develops!

consolidation and break out move. but which direction? i do not have to mention that. could be pre or during frankfurt open. if not then it's london.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Well, a fake-out move could also be a possibility.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I am monitoring 15 minutes tf indeed, now the price is ranging sitting on the level of the 2nd candle high, it would be interesting to see the price going lower piercing that level for a bouncing up, that could be an opportunity to go long, right? Amazing, it ls like a sniper Okrim

--- 帖子 #281 ---
you mentioned sniper. what is his main job? wait with patience. wait for price to come to you, not chasing price. analogy is a crocodile waiting under water for those thirsty preys to come to the river to have a drink some times prey not thirsty hahaha.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
when situations have more things stacking in your favor, just take the plunge if your method back you up with success three quarter of the time. one quarter of the time hitting SL. things like htf direction, ltf pattern appears, following the rules, time with market open (choice of entry: during market session is conservative, outside is considered aggressive).

--- 帖子 #283 ---
your m15 triggered trade. i trade the mtf engulfing method. there is not much difference with the one in this thread.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Are you already in? If so, which is your entry point? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
yes. using many methods, including this one here. will show after TP.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Just an example, i attatch GBPCHF 4hr TF, here we have a nice setup, right? On 15 minute TF we see the price is finding resistance right at the level of the low of the second 4hr candle. Here could be a good point for open a sell trade? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
m15 set up

--- 帖子 #288 ---
EURUSD 4hr TF we have the third candle bouncing right now I have entered based on 15m TF because the price is breaking the low of the second candle. Let me know if i am right or wrong, thanks!

Hi, i coded the same EA and there is the result i have (2023/01/01 - Today) EURUSD Daily

--- 帖子 #290 ---
There is also my result with this system on GBPUSD Daily (2023/01/01 - Today) You can find the EA i've made here if you want to test by yourself.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi David, this is my manual simulator results for the period of February 2023 till the February 2024 for EURUSD. Its similar to your results, and the only difference is in exits i think, and that makes a huge difference. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its very hard to code the ea for these type of strategies since, although my aim is to be mechanical 100%, i am tempted to close trades earlier, or simply ignore some signal because i dont like how the candle looks like on weekly. For example this is my manual demo testing's in last 2 weeks(7 trading days) on all pairs i can see, with as much as possible realistic trading, or the ones which would mimic my live account. My full focus is on DD, and fixed risk of 0.5% per trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will test your ea, but can you summarize the entry logic, and maybe we can collectivly improve it at least for entries.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi, What are the settings for this EA regarding money management? Is it coded with a set-and-forget approach? I'd like to see the results of making this strategy as mechanical as possible, setting a RRR of 1:2 and taking the entries the simplest way.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Regarding your ea, for now i can make 3 suggestions for now: 1. If trade is positive close at the end of DAY / input must be selectable. This way we can kill the order if it doesn't go anywhere. 2. Please check entry logic since i see on some cases that the first candle is bearish, second is bullish and the trade is open buy as per rules, or vice versa. First 2 candles should follow rules, 2 bearish, we wait for the pullback on the third on to enter sell as per rules, or 2 bullish and we wait for pullback after which we can enter the buy. (please note that i am trading with limit orders in order to avoid spread/slippage) For example first candle bearish, second bullish, trade shouldn't be placed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3. Risk must be 0.5%, this option should be unlocked for manual input. My test results are bellow, and they are good as far as i can see , result wise, but i am not sure if the entry logic is correct. All in all good work for a alpha version. EURUSD 2020.02.01- 2024.06.18 Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBPUSD 2020.02.01- 2024.06.18 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #294 ---
i appreciate your feed-back, I will add your option tomorrow and send it back here. did you use my ea in the last image you sent to achieve this result ? If yes can you tell me wich broker do you use to check the data ?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
No problem David, i used D1 for testing your EA on the last 2 pictures in my post , Darwinex broker, not a best solution but conservative as hell, so it keeps me on the safe path. Just to be on the same page here is a template i am using for candle coloring ,found it here somewhere on the forum thread. PS. I have a tendency to simplify things, maybe D5400 could add more useful inputs, since i am aware that this is very hard to code , developer, trader expectation wise.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Nice results on a conservative timeframe. Looking forward to zeze progress.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
This looks great - I understand how you do your entry, but what about stoploss placement? Is it below 1 or 2 candle? And do you have a fixed take profit or and end of day take profit?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
There is a V2. I have changed the trade opening condition to open a trade only if the previous two candles are of the same color. I have also added the option to manually choose the risk. For the 1. point you mentioned, I disagree. I will try to code it anyway, but I think it is unnecessary to close the trade if it is positive at the end of the day because those are usually the ones that hit the TP, unlike the others. So, I think it would be counterproductive and detrimental to profitability. This ea use the logic behind the Flash setup mentionned in First page. EA only take the trade when price retrace to n-2 candle high and break n-1 candle high (for a buy)

--- 帖子 #299 ---
There is the V3 with the condition "true or false" if true, EA will close the trade at the end of the day if it's profitable, and don't wait till TP

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Result of zezeV2 2020.01.01 till today

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I'm open to any idea regarding increase the profitability by adding new condition or changing the existing ones. Note that i'm not a dev, just using CHAT GPT4o to code this

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Can it code a mt5 version ? Not that I cant do it manual, but would be nice with an alert for a faster scan

--- 帖子 #303 ---
il sure it can, but mt5 is not working on my MacBook so I can’t test it…

--- 帖子 #304 ---
no body posting trades. the following happened today.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi David, I found some interesting data. V3 - EOD YEs Attached Image (click to enlarge) V3 -EOD NO Attached Image (click to enlarge) V1 - default Attached Image (click to enlarge) So i dont know why but V1 is by far most successful. Can you open on V1 ( the first ea you posted), input for the risk...by default its 3% if i am not mistaken. I would like to test it even more, and see why its working better then latest version. Somebody mentioned MT5, which i dont use, the only advantage i could see is that we could test all the pairs at the same time and see how would dynamics work in case when the multiple trades are opened on a different pairs. Today i had only 2 manual Trades, and deleted all the other pending orders since it was a madness on my regular job: AUDCAD SL Attached Image (click to enlarge) XAUUSD closed in profit Attached Image (click to enlarge) Nice trading day, no hassle.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi, can you explain me what you want me to do with the V1 ? i'm not sure to understand

--- 帖子 #307 ---
That you add option to enter risk % in the version from this link post: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...0#post14905010 As it is , i think now its 3% by default and it cannot be changed.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
V1 has more trades because it does not has the condition added on v2 &amp; v3 (2 bearish/bullish in a row): Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Inthebox, I focus my analysis on bigger tf, where I pull the trigger on daily tf, so I go slow. I work 9 hours per day far from pc. On evening time I scan the market and put an red flag for the pair near to the setup. If you like I will post my analysis tomorrow. I found very interesting scenario.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Is there a specific reason you are filtering by this condition? I don't recall reading anywhere on this thread anyone mentioning this.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Can you also test this on EUR USD 2020 01 01 till today. My result are not really good. Your one seems to be more promising but we are using same ea. There is the updated version with risk pourcentage accessible in the parameter manually.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
these are my results for the period EUR USD 2020 01 01 till today, 50k deposit ZEZE EA Attached Image (click to enlarge) ZEZE Original Attached Image (click to enlarge) Question, in Zeze original risk 0.03 mean 3% risk correct? So 0.5% risk would be 0.005? I am testing on darwinex so i am not sure about the discrepancy between our results. I know that Sunday candle can mess results significantly.

Getting closer to dashboard. Look at the three candle code. I made it symbolic. It will take time to get it. The idea behind is like rubber bands, doors and explosions. Say a door has a spring that closes. You open a door a bit and then spring closes it. That's what we want when we trade the bounce: open the door and then have it close on us and kick us out with pockets full of money. But if you push the door open too far, you run into a room and face another door. The house has three doors. If you run through three doors, the house explodes. Or, rubber band snaps. Left is for Long. Right is for shoRt. We record long situation on the left, and short situation on the right. They are separated by bar "|". We record second candle, or candle[1] close to "|" and first candle or candle[2] next, separated by "." We'll have to put in dashboard to see if it makes it easy to train the eye. We record what is right now and what third candle or candle[0] did to previous two candles. If price is below a candle's low and didn't poke above it, then for short side it's "-", which means nothing happened. For long side it's "*", which means total disaster, explosion, rubber band snapped. If price is below a candle's low but did poke above it, then for short side it's "]", the door was opened and then closed. If price is above a candle's low, then for short side it's "&gt;", the door is opened, rubber band is stretched. We don't care whether candle is green or red. We count its levels for short side from bottom up. and we count from up to bottom for long side. The effective configuration will tell us the colors if we are interested. We record what happened towards the bar "|". which means current events are near the bar, and past events are away from the bar. ]&gt;&gt;| means price is inside the body of candle[1], and it did poke below the body into the bottom wick. We know this because left of the bar is for the long side, and we count levels from top to bottom for longs.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
how are we supposed to use this code in live trading ?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
It should help anticipate desired price movement. It will be in a table for multiple timeframes and multiple instruments.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
can you give some examples ? I have to admit that I don’t really understand your post and all the logic.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I don't want to type out all codes for multiple timeframes. Examples will be easier to give with working dashboard. The logic is simple: there's no bias, only opportunity, that's why code gives three candle configuration from both perspectives: long and short. More is coming.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Looks familiar

--- 帖子 #319 ---
According to this, maybe we can try to add a new condition "candle n-1 must have been take the low of candle n-2"

Why has the thread gone silent all of a sudden? This strategy looks promising.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Guys can someone explain once again when we need to look for a test of the high/low of the 1st candle.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
If you catch it on monthly timeframe then it's pretty cool. If you're looking to catch monthly candle then beginning of the month is the time to look for high/low test. If you're looking to catch daily candle, then look for news and session transitions between asian/london london/new york

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thank you, I see the same strategy as BMF on Twitter, but yours is easier to understand, you are all great, I have to learn. In addition, in order to identify 3cr more easily, what indicator tool is better to use?
