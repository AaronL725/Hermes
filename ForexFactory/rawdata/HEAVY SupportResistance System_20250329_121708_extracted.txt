HEAVY Support/Resistance System About me: Trade only about 3 years. Age 25, Singapore, 26 soon at end of July. Doing Manual &amp; EA trading, alt coin mining and website related stuffs. A chart speaks a thousand word. But the kind of information obtain out of a chart is different for every individual trader Attached Image (click to enlarge) However the chart did mention good sell, but price could still go higher as its not at the top yet. However its just that the entry at this zone to 1.6500 is a good entry compare to somewhere in between . Never ever long/short a pair because its near whole number or "good price", rather you should look at previous reaction to the price zone using historical data like H1,H4 TF which tell you where likely seller or buyer could be hiding at for opportunity entry. Another example of AUD/USD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another example of USD/JPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) *Dont bother about the buy on this chart because its an EA that I forgot to switch off, its not my real entry, my real system is on an Non-MT4 system. Everyday, there are multiple entry to be made on heavy support and resistance. If you like this system, you can also share your observation on other pair that is currently in the Heavy Support/Resistance zone. I will post more live chart rather than historical chart in the future. Its just the beginning . Hope fellow traders can share their support/resistance of Live Chart observation too with picture. Inserted Video No matter how good indicators you got, it is always "LAGGED" and not the best thing to consider. The best thing for trading is to use your eyes and look for price action. In my context, which is support / resistance , High Volume @ Low/High - Market Behavior of Buying/Selling at certain price. There no gurantee that the price will react the same upon touching the same zone, its more of not picking the low or high, but rather put a SL to minimize your impact. I used to look @ many systems, but the best one I have found is just trading with the market, the trend, if there strong buying, its a turning point, vice versa for selling. It was never easy to hold firm in this ideology, but it have give me more withdrawal than deposit in the past month. more than 100% return of my investment.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
what are the indicators you have using ?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Frankly speaking what Indicator I use is not important as of this system. The most important is Heiken Ashi candles for me to look @ price action. Basically the strength of previous [STRONG] support &amp; resistance is not to be look at lightly. [STRONG] Not some weak candle with small volume should be considered, if you notice the 3 charts i posted above do speaks to you how heavy that price is holding. NEVER EVER GO AGAINST THE FLOW OF TREND. ALWAYS TRADE WITH STOP LOSS. BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW HOW FAR A TREND CAN GOES ON. My kind of trading is more of a scalper, KISS ideology KEEP IT SHORT &amp; SIMPLE. Guys do share your Support/Resistance insight for today trading ** Y ou can also feedback on my charts / system , I am open to all kind of constructive discussion. ** Your feedback or reply on this thread will keep this thread alive and stay on If lack of attention this thread will probably start to fade away.

Just closed my EUR/USD long in profit Now added new position to GBP USD Short. This is a good spot to entry a short position using this HEAVY SUPPORT/RESISTANCE ideology Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Another chart to share for today Attached Image (click to enlarge) So much money to be made . But I not entering this as I am in GBP/USD short for now. Look @ the previous 2 candle stick, long and show heavy buyer hiding at that area.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
hello chaosbun, what is your TP for gbpusd then...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
nice simple logical trading... picking swing points are higher TF SR levels, so will pay really well, especially if you hold them longer. Why dont you lose all that junk on your charts? you dont need it for your system.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Those junk doesn't affect my vision I used to create a system called TDI H1 Chaos system, but after using it over time, I realize heavy support &amp; resistance of historical price seems to pay off better . The idea is to entry at the extreme end and even if thing goes against you, the damage is limited. I not trying to pick a high or low here. Not only looking at previous strong support and resistance zone, we also should look at the candle stick length and the reaction on the price upon retest. Look @ the Candle stick and price action to get an idea of where price would move next Thanks for your feedback and compliment 60minuteman. Cheers, enjoy trading.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
maybe you could explain more how you pick your areas, where you exit and any other nuances (i think for beginners it would be easier for them to understand your concept without all the indicators..)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
My exit is when price stop moving when e.g for GBP/USD if it fall and touch a previous support and went into tight trading zone, I might consider adjust my SL in profit / Trail stop or close position in profit. I might use TDI for such move too. My entry is simple, look @ the candlestick as can see on the AUD/USD &amp; GBP/USD chart I post today . The Candlestick length and the reaction when retest previous strong support/resistance. Out of all the indicator I use, the only one that is needed for this system is simply Heiken Ashi, and probably TDI for my exit usage. The TF that I play is at least a H1, sometime I use H4 , D1 is the rare case. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There is no guarantee that my entry is a 100% profit, its just that the chance of winning is higher than usual. HEAVY is used because as you can see on previous resistance, the reaction is a very strong bearish movement. ** However price might not repeat like what It does on previous case. Fundamental events can change the technical outlook. Its just I look @ Candlestick &amp; the previous reaction thus I decided to short. The fall might not occur instantly, sometime its can took 1 day, 2 days or maybe 1 week to get to a proper return of investment. ---------- Another possible chart on heavy resistance zone EUR/AUD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hey, thank for time to post your system. Is based on solid principles. How do you use Heiken Ashi as part of this? e.g Is entry after candle changes color, with stop above the swing? Or is it to stay in the trade? Sorry if I jumping ahead.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I use very similar simple resistance and support strategy, maybe the same if i am understanding you right... but i only use TDI and Stochastic to confirm entry or exit SOMETIMES. It works really well if you are good at spotting those entries. Thanks to this i may be getting a serious trading job soon. Anyway i was wondering if its possible to create an EA based on this... i always wondered, never really searched if there is one there. Entries for SHORT could be under the resistance line. SL few pips above from entry resistance line. Entries for LONG few pips above support line. SL few pips under entry support line. TP is harder to figure out. I think it could work well on 4 hour chart. Is there such an EA out there, can someone make it happen?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Heiken Ashi is good as u can see the HA High,Low,Open &amp; Close. Main concern is the high/low vs the close. How much seller &amp; buyer appear at a certain price zone. TimeFrame that I use mainly is H1, and then H4(sometimes). Entry can be before candle change color, probably when you meet some long wick or you think seller/buyer is heavy at a certain price which previously serve as a turning point of price. Stop loss can be at the high/low + N pips where N is a value u want, probably 10 pips. But its up to you. Actually its not necessary to use EA to do this, the amount of trade you could open a day is probably less than 3, the thing is not to get in fast, its rather to get in "right". Move with the market. TP is depend on individual appetite for risk, probably some would be happy with 30 pips while some prefer a 100 pip profit. What can be done is to put SL in break even + 1 to protect your original equity. I would always advise you not to use an EA if you are serious enough, its better to train yourself rather than rely on coding. For real money trading, I still advise you to learn to pick chart &amp; post it here, then share &amp; let other users feedback on your entry. Be it a mistake or a good entry. I myself do use EA but that EA is more for long term, rather than this system. Take a look at the chart below. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Did you notice that in the past few days, price touch the same zone . went up &amp; then went down again and then went up. This is showing you that buyer is appearing at that PRICE ZONE, I would call it HEAVY SUPPORT. The concern is, price might break lower because the buyer might have run out of stream, mostly entry is best at the 2nd time test of the heavy support/resistance. Another chart to see USD/JPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) What do you think will happen if price test 38.2% again, the 102.90 - 103.20 zone, It might not even test that zone if 50.0% fibo hold. However a good entry for long would probably at the 102.90 - 103.20 zone.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Yeh my biggest weaknes is over trading when I get confident. .. I am not a patient guy but this works best with me when I am disciplined. EAs are not good I know but I dont believe there isn't a profitable ea out there.

Reviving my death thread Attached Image (click to enlarge) A long position at 0.8970 - 80 zone looks good My Entry Plan Long @ Current price 0.8988 (1/3 equity in) ----------------------- If price continue to fall and show heavy buying candle I will look to long another batch at 0.8955 ---------------------- If price went up and breach 0.9000 and touch 0.9030 and retrace - Add Long Position @ 0.9015

My trading records for 28 Dec 2013 to Today (Why 28 dec and not other date, because its the date I start my other thread TDI H1 Chaos System) Deposit Payment In: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Withdrawal Cash out: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am using CMC Market Singapore for the nice spread and easy cashout / deposit without fees. I am using FxCM for my analysis in Mt4 For now I am comfortable with trading with $4000 SGD on my account, and making big entry ( 1/3 to 1/4 of my equity ) per Trade Position -- For how I manage to keep winning Its simple , don't just follow blindly on your Indicator, look at the price action , Volume at High / Low and you will ride the trend. Even if price went against you, eventually things will goes back your way and you can cash out your position.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Some gold bear lover, will you short at this point? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will like to short but my broker at CMC seems to have extremely bad margin leverage and the profit will be very minimal using much of my equity. A SL at 1290 would seem perfect to cut loss.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Going in for my 2nd entry of USD/CHF Long Attached Image (click to enlarge) After that I will wait.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Actually I don't see what's wrong with using indicators. Even prop traders use indicators, bank traders rely on things like RSI, moving averages too; all depends on the system.. but as a rule of thumb, indicators that give similar/same information shouldn't be used together.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Nothing wrong with using Indicators. I am also using them, but sometime indicator are lag thats why I mention don't follow blindly. Even using indicator, we should apply some of our evaluation and judgement to place a proper entry.

Adding my Final equity to USD/CHF Long Attached Image (click to enlarge) Ding 3 position of USD/CHF Long to go, the candle is more obvious at this current 50 zone, showing buyer occurance.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
gold got squeezed out, but 1290, would that have been quiet a large sl?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
How do you determine TP?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Fundamental overpower technical. Thats all i can say What technical can do is give you an idea of price action. But what Yellen testi today is a gold rush thats causes the SL. Anyway I not in that position due to the leverage with my broker. TP is mostly take at the next support/resistance or when price start to dance at a small range. -- Position updates -- Closed my USD Chf Postion #2 and #3 and make roughly 7% returns of equity. Position #1 still running with minimal unrealized loss. Added new position AUD/USD Short - Using Daily Chart to determine entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Your stop losses are huge. what percentage of your account is stop loss?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
You mean unrealize loss ? For now my loss is like less than $100 of a $4000 account. Regarding my SL position for the trade I open is roughly on the next support/resistance. I do watch price action to prevent stuck on a bad trend. So far so good. Price is going as what I see

--- 帖子 #27 ---
My question , how much of the account do you risk per trade?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I risk about 30% to 50% per trade. I set SL and to make my maximum loss to 10-20% of my equity per trade. --- I closed my USD/CHF &amp; AUD/USD position in 7.2% equity profit. Withdrawn all Current only Position: -- Open GBP/USD short &amp; EUR/GBP Long Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

[quote=chaosbun;7278614]{quote} I risk about 30% to 50% per trade. I set SL and to make my maximum loss to 10-20% of my equity per trade. Wow... 10-20% risk on each trade...you will kill the account.... I wish you luck...

Today outlook GBP/USD Look like a good buy at this level 1.663x , so do EUR/USD. EUR/CHF will be good buy when it reach 1.2170, I see more pushing down soon which will be a good entry soon. The best price for GBP/USD would be near 1.6600 though. My recent trade was quite well. I am stuck with USD/CHF but unleash most of them. This week increase my bankroll by a few thousands, probably because I short EUR/USD at 1.3750 and close at 85 today, and also short at 1.3741 yesterday and close at 18 low before it rebounce. Also did some EUR/CHF grinding. It seems trading get finer when a trader turn 3 years old Even SPX500 work with Heavy support/resistance trading method This is an account I open @ Etoro 2 days ago and this is my trade history Attached Image (click to enlarge) I open at etoro just because initially I wanna trade SPX500 with 50x - 100x leverage which my Singapore Broker couldn't provide. Some FXPro result which I trade 1 Lot ++ Attached Image (click to enlarge) I din't include my singapore broker which I trade with higher balance, the account is also winning, with very little unrealize loss for USD/CHF for now. So what is a HEAVY Support/Resistance Simply just look at chart like this Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some chart of USD/JPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its seems buyer appear at 101.95 - 102.10 area If not for recent China issue, I might had long NZD/USD , but for now I will stay out of NZD

Hi, thank you for share your trading experiece. I see in your chart that you have HA and BB. You use theese two indicator for determinate Heavy Support and resistance or you analyze only the price movement? Thank you

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi thanks for commenting. I use Heiken Ashi as my main candlestick, I use it to analyze where Buyer &amp; Seller appear, base on the thickness and length of the Bar. I use H1/H4 and sometime D1 Chart to analyze. Bollinger Band is just extra information, it factor less than 5% of my trade opening criteria. Mainly I see price action at certain price zone where historical buyer and seller appear in the past few days, not just some buying, but rather big pushing up/down Thats why i use the word " HEAVY " Support/Resistance My method seems to be ANTI Trending trading , but actually I am just following trend , I join in when the seller or buyer appear. Another chart to share Attached Image (click to enlarge) Take a look at EUR/GBP chart, you can spot where the selling &amp; buying take place If you was to trade EUR/GBP , your SL should be place in this way Attached Image (click to enlarge) Somewhere below the zone where the previous Heavy Rally took place Same thing for GBP/USD long Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would place my SL below the previous heavy buyer zone However there are some fundamental news that might cause RISK OFF (USD Buying) in regards to Ukraine issue. So trade safely.

Pick another trade for tonight. EURO short. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Risk: Medium (Careful of adding position at 1.3880 - buyer accumulation zone) Euro stay in the range of 1.3880 - 1.3940 for now, tonight FOMC statement will push out of the gap. EURO upside limited to 1.4000 (whole number), bias is more towards downside. Adding short now with a SL 100 ( above 1.400 + 20 pips) to 150 pips away is a good medium term trade. Short term trade is to add now and a SL above recent high at around 1.3980 should be fine. But careful of whipsaw at High Key Event. I will still prefer place SL above 1.4000 with 20-30 pips buffer.

Ding dong. Trade was good. Closed. If anyone do follow my guide above should be happily counting profit.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
hi chaosbun can you explain me what you wanna mean for risk: reward 100 :30 ?? you will risk 100 point in loss, to take 30 point profit? thank you

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You mean my EUR/CHF trade quite a while ago, yes I will risk 100 pips to ensure my trade is safe and secure. And take 30 pips scalping profit. There no exact reason why you can't risk 100 just to get 30. Even if you risk 30 to get 100 doesn't mean 1 will be successful and profitable. The main thing of trading is to secure your capital, follow by making profits. Risk / Reward need not necessary be 1: N(must be above 1) , the main thing is look at price action and close when need to.

AUD/USD Long Attached Image (click to enlarge) Possible buy zone at this price due to historical support.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Possible Sell Zone - USD/CAD , Seller appear at 1.127x Attached Image (click to enlarge) If want to take this position, stop is advisable 10-20 pips above last high.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Chaosbun, i like your way to trade. For a long time i choice to trade using very smal stop loss, with a rr 1:3 , exactly i risking 3-4-5 pips, to take 9-12 -15 profit. The most of the direction was right , but price took before my stop loss and then go in my direction. Regarding the chart of USDCAD you posted, price broke the resistance, i think is something like a stop hunting, so it could be down . But by the way the difficoult using this R/S strategy is to identify the zone of support and resistance , i wanna mean, we can undestand same exactly point of low /high to take advantage of a support /resistance, but not the zone, this is more difficult. Last question Mr.Chaosbun,did you never try something like this in 1 min charts?n the scalping way?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Nepul, Thanks for liking my trading style. The reason why this thread is call HEAVY support / resistance instead of just support/resistance is because HEAVY refer to strong buying/selling at certain point which make its more reliable. M1 is too weak to be term "heavy", while H1,H4 and D1 works better.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Heavy Support spotted at EUR/USD long Attached Image (click to enlarge) SL put 1.3740 will be good. Seems like 1.3750 is DEFENDED as of now.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Whoever actually follow my pick for today, your AUD/USD should be up by 30 PIPS.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Chart to watch for the next few hours &gt; EUR CHF &lt; Attached Image (click to enlarge) Should price test 1.2160 , its a good entry. SL will mostly be 100 pips below. Target Profit is around 30 to 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Another nice entry will be EUR/AUD long Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do the pictures show you something, to me its look like EURO is suppose to be add in dip Most of the EURO pair tell me that EURO will go higher. Should EJ fall, I will not be in a rush to add more position, I will wait till the next Heavy Support zone. P.S: No matter what I say, its still your responsibility to set a STOP LOSS to limit your loss for any trades you open.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
GBP/USD had daily chart going with old resistance turn support. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Above is a daily chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its also explain why price got supported at H1. If price retest near that zone, I might entry a long. If I got a position for G/U, my stop will likely be lower than the support line.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Chaos, nice tread. Looking at your chart and post, is it look at 1hr and see the past S/R, and wait for the next long tail at those area to determine if there's support or resistance there. Once long tail appear, go in and trade accordingly. The S/L should be last known S/R? Do you look at session to determine whether to enter?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
By the way my strategy is very close to the strategy of this post. The difference is that you enter in a 1h -4h .daily signal. I wait for a 1h 4h -daily signal of support/resistance but then i go in 1 min chart and from there i start my entry . I dont know why and maybe somebody can help me to understand the reason, but it seems that the ex support and resistance(for example what before was a resistance now become a support) works better than a normal resistance or support with more precision. The only one problem for my strategy and for what i'm waiting to optimize it , is the trade management, i 'm waiting to understand what is the better for me. You Chaosbun told me an RR like risk 10 pips(or 100) to take 3 (or 30) in profit.. i wanna try.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Nepul, as long you can determine the support/resistance level, do NOT enter straight away, look at price action too. If price do stop, if price is starting to change etc. and then you join in the trend. ------------ Danieltang, the price keep change, so do Heavy Support/Resistance, I always look at the chart to see if I detect any retracement on a sharp fall/rally, then I might join in following the new trend direction. Price action is important, look at the candle behavior, always use at least H1, up to D1 for your analysis. Don't use too low TF, I know its fun to get into trade, but its more fun to win money than regret your actions. ----------- Placing a trade require some courage, and confidence on the trade you pick, as long you on the right trend, even if price move against you, you need to stand firm and price will eventually be the same way as you. For example I got a E/J long at 141.10 yesterday, then today it fall to as low as 140.60, but I reopen at that spot, because there some buying at that spot, about 1 hour ago from this post, I just close both of them at 141.28 Not only that trade, I also reopen my GBP/USD long at 80 zone and close at 05, a few times, it is really nice scalping. The same for EUR/AUD which I open at 3x yesterday which is still running, it fall to 7x earlier on (60 pips) and I reopen a new position there, and close after. I also close my USD/CAD after the good CPI result. The thing is, as long you make full use of the buying/selling zone, not just minor TF like M15 or M5 or even M1, but H1,H4 and D1, and watch the candle, you should be good grinding a few thousand dollars with just 2-3k capital. You can say its a risky trading method, but its a profitable one once you involve $0 capital. Inserted Video

Observation since I deploy this strategy for my trading. 1) Profits 2) Lesser mistake 3) No speculation on news The idea of this strategy is to look for historical support/resistance ( buying / selling zone ) that are of heavy volume. &gt; Stop Loss need to be deploy, my SL will be from 30 pips to 100 pips. &gt; Profit taking will be when price stuck or get into ranging When price hit a previous strong buying or selling zone, it will stop for a while, or a long pin bar will be form. Upon the pin bar form, its show that there is a lot of buyer/seller at that very point. It could continue fall, but 1 need to watch the candle and then made decision to buy/sell at that zone. Sometime I just load like $400 to 1 of my FxPro account, go for a 0.8 lot size trade using 1:500 leverage and cash out at $600-$700 equity which is about $300 profit. Making big profit or large % of your equity does not require a lot of capital. Its better to use lesser capital and you will have lesser fear. Cash out your winning so you will be consistent instead of making it a big sum then lose it all. If the trade fail, sometime its wiser to close in small loss when it losing just $20-$40 instead of when it become $200-$400. There surely mistake made as even me to date also make 1 or 5 mistakes in a week which sometime stuck my trade for 1 - 3 days before it get release in a small profit / loss. 3) No speculation on news Sometime when Forex economic news release, price will get push to the last historical support/resistance(heavy). Heavy means a support/resistance that is of notable volume. This news will bring the price to the good buy/sell zone and then retrace. Which most of the time it do, unless the news is too strong. Like FED minutes this week which cut down a few EURO/USD support, which at that point I was shorting so its okay. Most of the time trade are being stop out due to speculate of Whole Number e.g 1.3800 , 1.3900 and assuming they will hold. but the best support/resistance is actually better to be reference from previous support/resistance of notable volume. You need not be a math expert or a genius to understand this ideology, its just that the big players are buying/selling with their orders at that zone/spot and its better to ride with them. Hope more people will contribute to the charts and post your heavy support/resistance chart

Forex Trading is also about Buying a Strong Currency //// Against a Weak Currency. How to notice which currency is strong while which is weak, just look at the price action of the 2 currency. (1) Strong currency is a currency that despite having bad news against it, it does not move much or so. (2) Weak currency is a currency that got sell on every rally. The seller holding firm, bad recent news / statement by Central Banker. So its very simply buying a strong currency against a weak currency. It sound simple and straight to the point, but many people when jump to the market or trading a live market have no common sense like this, sometime includes me I am a risky trader, I risk almost 100% of my floating balance at my accounts every week. But I manage to make back quite a big sum for consistent 3 months since I use this system that I observe myself. Anyone can trade any amount, be it 1% or 2% or even 30% in a trade, as long you are confident and got the right strategy. But never trade amount you cannot afford to lose. In the past I used to bias against a certain currency, expect if its go too HIGH, it can't go any higher, this is absolutely wrong . If it go too high, it can go down. But at a certain previous resistance that turn support(heavy), it can go higher where we say as "Add in dips". After take away that prejudice of mine, I manage to ride with the trend for quite comfortably. Every profit counts, 1 need not just close trade for EXTREME profit, sometime a scalp of 10-20 pips per trade, which if you do 5-10 trades , its over a 100 pips and is a good profit if you risk as big as me.

good to read your posts and find a good trader using the bband rare to get bband traders to exchange trading methods in ff btw what is your setting for bband? it does not seem to be the standard 20,2 or 20,1? what ma you use in your chart? my trade G/U here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...00#post7357000 cheers

I think its 50,2 , I saw your thread on GU but I beg to differ that only if 1.5480 break in a large margin, GU will then continue head south till the next heavy support. I reload quite a few long at 8x zone and is scalping happily as the support is quite good.

Ok Chaosbun. regarding the money management, for a long time i was using some different way for example 1:3 - 1:2 or 3:1 - 2 :1. Then i realized that for me the most profitable R:R is 1 :1 , but when i reach the profit i cut 3/4 of the trade and put the breakeven. But this way only for 4h or daily trading. Else in my scalping strategy i use a completely different way to manage the money. The focus is that if we open a position without sense we have 50 % to win and 50% to lose, with support and resistance we have more than 50 % to win. So i take it easy, using a 1 :1 R:R, but if i lose, i double the lots. So first 0.1 then 0.2-0.4-0.8-1.6. i know many people dont like the martingale, but i'm using it for a long time and i didn't entered for more of 0,4 so no more of 3 consecutives losing trade. And in the meanwhile doubling the capital. By the way as i told , this is only for scalping (1 min and 5 min), and i'm still studying to improve this system. Ps : i would post my completely strategy but i dont know how to become a full member, hoping some advice to do it.

Your kind of entry is adding position to a losing position. At time when it retrace, it will definitely be good. The pro and cons of your scalping method is Pros 1) Easy to make money 2) Adding position to a losing position will average your position Cons 1) Easy to lose money too. As you add more to your loser, a trending market will kills your balance fast. 2) If your initial trade was open correctly, you only make 0.1 lot size worth, which is very little compare to if you put 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 which is 0.7 at your first position, you would make 7 times more. 3) When you open more and more position, the tendency of you close them in LOSS is very hard. because you already hold them very long, position 1 to 3, it will be difficult for you to cut loss and you might face difficult situation. I still suggest not to add to loser, rather you put a SL, if its hit, thats it. Try find another way to make back the money by looking for new opportunity. But everyone got their own way of trading. I trade before your method so I know the pros and cons. I tried almost everything in the past and lose a lot of money. Only until I change myself then I can achieve profitable months of trading.

Hi Chaos, thanks for the reply. I can't post a chart now, just curious, in your opinion, for Eur/Usd is 1.3840-50 consider a heavy resistance to you?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
just to share some experience with you my friend, i try using a system which i believe has a 50% chances of winning. Each trade i took $50, thinking that each losses i will just double it. To cut story short, i lose more than 2k just to try win that $50, which i didn't double it again as it just doesn't make sense to lose another 2k to win a $50. I'm glad i pay that 2k to learn such a lesson though. I read up on it and understand that there's actually a term for it. Is call risk of ruin.Just to share.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Its is adding to loser. Which will be heavy sum IF the trend goes few hundred pips in the direction against you. One should just set a SL on the trade you open, and if it touch, forget it. Find another opportunity. The main thing here is to get a win rate of like lets say 80%, assume 5 trade you lose 1. Humble up, keep your ego, take the loss. If you add to loser, you will be BIAS to a certain direction, you "PRAY" that it goes your direction and you will close everything. But market is CRUEL, they don't care if you lose or win. Never trade base on "PRAY", "HOPE" , just trade base on looking at price action, observe it, place the right trade, set a SL. Wait for profit.

if you could have waited for the h4 completed then you might change your call. imho:- the past 2x 4h candles shown are PB + solid bear candle and following the daily downtrend so, for the near term, a short is seem favoured no taken on this pair but A/U + A/J as both gave similar formations my g/j stays same http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...01#post7357001 cheers

Hope you guys made a killing with the heavy support trades. I closed my E/U , G/U , E/A in profits. I still got unrealize loss E/A running thou, but all is good now Happily cashing out winning. New Trade Recommendation AUD/USD short Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Another good deal to go EUR/GBP short Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not the best position, the best one is near 0.8400, but I will not mind taking a position here after a rapid euro rally earlier on. Expect to scalp 20-40 pips for this trade.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
By the way what i meant before was not adding position to a losing position, but close that and open another one. It's seems the same but it's different. Anyway i agree with you is not a good way to manage money but i really want to try something different from the normal R:R . I also tried the hedge but it's useless for me. Chaosbun, can you explain me the real difference from your heiken ashi candle and the normale candle? i always used the normal candle.. How you take advantage from them?

EUR/GBP Short Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would like to recommend this, a stop loss above 0.8330 is required. EUR/AUD short - Higher Risk Attached Image (click to enlarge) I would like to recommend this too. At least 50 pips play is required.

what do you guys think of Eur/Jpy now? I'm waiting for it to show some weakness and going in for a short.

I´m not sure about the JPY.I would wait. What about USDCAD?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I will wait it reach the white area(about 1.1010 - 1.100). Just my opinion though.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Danieltag.You were right about CAD.....

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Congrat Daniel, you sort of master the simple technique I trying to brought forward. The chart is very well shared. I also hope those who look at this thread yesterday make some decent 20 pips at EUR/GBP and 40 pips at EUR/AUD ------------------------------- @Wether, the E/J chart was correct, I did went in at that spot, did you went in? You can actually check JPY pairs resistance using Usd/Jpy Too ! For all the EUR cross pairs Players Traders, be careful, either book your profit or be prepare for another test of high by EURO as now its testing the support , either make or break. Its a risk, but a break below 60 will see we test 45 very soon. (EUR/USD) or a retracement to the 90 zone is very possible. Just be careful. 1 thing you can't be sure is whether ECB will take actions tommorow. The reaction to me is 1) Rally to break 1.38 - If no rate cut 2) IT might test 1.3820 , then break lower when Draghi talk. ---------------------------------------- Why the ECB might not cut rate or negative deposit despite the 0.5% inflation, very simple. What euro zone need is investment, they need make euro stable, cutting rate will discourage investment in some ways, also knowing that the inflation is at 0.5%, but the core inflation are stable at 0.8%, which the transition(not so important) reading are lower so I doubt any action will be taken so fast. So the initial reaction could be a knee jerk rally by euro, follow by a retracement. You are warned, since 75% of trader like us(retail/speculator) are shorting EURO because of the low inflation, the chances are the shorter will get wash away first, before a real down trend begin. Thats my 2 cents thoughts. If you can escape now without much loss, just do it. I wish for this moment since yesterday, I make 30 pips average per euro trade, I open like near 5 lots. which i quite happy I did escape now. ----------------------- The EURO/USD Chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you notice the price is ranging between the yellow box and orange box. I only think EURO will drop if only they implement some nasty negative deposit rate which I doubt will put in place since CORE CPI is stable as of now. I not trying to convince you to close your euro position, but sometime I believe its important to "secure" your capital rather than speculate with 50% chance. Anyway I will re-open EURO position if its hit my heavy support/resistance zone.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
well...I didn´t trust the JPYs but did some PIPS in EURGBP and EURAUD... very interesting your comments about EURO.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I did a small experiment, did a LONG with EUR/USD SL I am using 30 pips below recent range low. Its better to use 35 pips thou. My target is a 20-30 Pips profit Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its currently at recent support, which historically proven strong. USD is relatively slightly strong now, as major usd pairs are falling in value. Just trade with care.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I do play that chart too, I entry slightly earlier at 28 , but I close just only, which bag me 40 pips profit. Happy as I open a few lots for it. You EURO/AUD Chart is very well play off too. Congrat Werther. IT seems this strategy is not hard to apply and can be very naked without much indicator. I realise few important thing after trading for 3 years 1) Secure your capital 2) Don't over trade what you can't afford to lose 3) Don't open too many positions because it will be very hard to close 4) KISS principle - Keep it simple stupid 5) Always and always use a stop loss, and not just put Stop loss for fun, put it at a place that make sense ( above previous resistance + 10-15 pips or below previous support + 10-15 pips etc ) 6) Learn to close your trade and take loss if need to or learn to take small / big profit base on market situation. 7) NEVER try to speculate news because its very risky to do so. Unless you really dam good in it. 8) Ride the Trend (Hardest)

Nice!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
i'm thinking something about the point where we can exactly enter in a trade. For sure here there are trader better than me and can give me some answers. When we talk about heavy support and resistance we refer about a price zone where it's nice to buy /sell. The problem is where exactly it's better to insert the trade, i will try to be more clearly. Watch the photo. If i buy in a resistance zone maybe price can hit the order but still go up for others pips in the resistance zone, so we should the position hold until it go in profit, or in lose. i do in this way , if there is a price zone i will make a order zone. My stop loss and profit will be the same . In the photo is not possible to see but i placed more order in all the resistance zone, one in the starter of the zone was reached and went in profit. If price go directly up without retrace and bouncing on resistance i will take a normal stop loss. what do you think?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Trading always have risk. The answer for you in this case might be to watch for pin bar with heavy volume of buying/selling. Notice how price bounce at certain price ,e.g 1.3750 for EU and 1.4870 for E/A at the past few hours. I entry for E/A long and make a sweet 30-40 pips profit (Din't post chart here).

Can say is right, because you use a previous strong support to aid your position. Just that your candlestick color is not easy to read, but thats the naked chart Nice play thou !! Do share more with us your entries , I also forgot CAD was a good hedge for EURO, cause CAD sort of too over buy as of now. Remember to input your stop loss in case price turn, and never assume a previous strong support/resistance always work, sometime need to see price action too.

All the pairs you posted was fine. Just that to be safe. You might wanna use a tight stoploss. The chart which interest me probably is all except aud usd short. Maybe because if you look at it. Aud is quite Bullish. And also the pinbar seems not thick enough to withstand buyers. But nevertheless. Its worth a shot with tight sl.on Monday we have jpy monetary policy. Uj might be a good play. But be careful Consider if boj going increase stimulus or so , gbp aud and usd likely benefit. And careful of playing aud as euro weakness Is providing aud with strength. And consider what yellen say about usd recently doesnt seems to looks good on usd.But usd jpy is consider a risk pair but aud usd not.I will likely try gu long. Uj long and usd cad long on monday

NZD/USD long before the NZD cpi release. Attached Image (click to enlarge) With NZD/USD at the well support heavy low, and if this low break, it will change trend of nzd, but I don't think so. because nzd seem very well supported and good to long for now to get a smooth 30-50 pips profit. I already in at 34-38 zone. Its not late to join nzd love 2 things that will affect nzd other than Ukraine tensions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ---------------- M15 zoom in for NZD/USD Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you look at the forecast, and the prior, NZD is forecast at 0.5% from prior 0.1% , the prospect is positive and market is looking for good inflation data from NZD . However China GDP is revised lower to 7.4% from prior 7.7% and China might not even able hit the 7.4%, the risk is quite high. However if China able to substain a 7.4% to 7.5%, commodities pair will benefit greatly. Given a choice with sufficient rewards from nzd, I will exit my nzd trades in profit before china gdp q/y However if the move is very limited, I will hold for china data. If you look at my previous few charts that I post e.g AUD/USD yesterday before AUD monetary minutes which I recommend a short at 0.9410 zone, and you close now or earlier on, you will already bag 50 pips or so. I think its quite important to look at both technical and fundamental. To add on, if you think about the Ukraine tension that is on-going, Euro is not a good place to park money, so do USD dovish stance. The only left options are Commodities pair and yen. With yen unpredictable, I will go for commodities. Advice: Always set SL to expect the unexpected. My words are just my views, everyone have their own position &amp; method to trade the market. My words here are just for reference and sharing. Anyone are welcome to post their heavy support/resistance feedback/charts to share with the rest

Sell GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Today bad move I set a buy limit to buy USD/CAD at 1.09571, the price went to 1.09586 and rebounce.. The reason for my call there was heavy support was at 1.09561 previously and I was depicting that the price will be attracted to previous support and bounce.. next time need give 3 pips allowance +3 / -3 ------------------------------------ Look out for a good long at 1.3794 approx for EUR/USD . Touch trend line &amp; Heavy Support. But I went in already at this current price with stop around 1.3770 spot. Either it break the trend line and head to 1.37 zone or it continue its uptrend. I manage to increase my 3 accounts equity by like 20% this week. Although my nzd call for fundamental reason was fail last night, but manage scalp a lot of trades with trend line &amp; heavy support/resistance and still up my realized equity (after minus all the losses). A new way to look at chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trend line and Heavy Support/Resistance is the same thing. GU recent out break Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUR GBP Signal ( Just combine top 1 and top 2 ) will give you top 3 (Today movement) Attached Image (click to enlarge) ​Sometime have you wonder if trend line is just coincidence or its work. I would pair it up with a heavy support/resistance zone for entry with stop loss at next heavy support/resistance within 30-50 pips range. ---------------------------- I am thinking AUD will go down , pair it up with my 34,89 EMA and the trend line, with the heavy resistance. The questions are when ? and will it work, how much I need risk and when I need take profit. It could/might touch the higher trend line near 0.9400 and then retrace. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am also taking a long call for EUR/USD as of now. Anyway my forecast might not be accurate, just like yesterday my nzd forecast was fail due to CPI only hit 0.3% instead of expected 0.5% lead to NZD fall 50 pips. Always trade with SL &amp; caution. I am still learning to get a better view of chart and price.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Support comes in at 102.36 zone If UJ Break below 102.30, I might do a short . --------------------------------------------------------- Euro break the daily pivot, and went higher, will the pivot hold as a firm support for more uptrend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) --------------------------------------------------------- A look at the H1 chart tells us that EURO got some HEAVY support at 1.3806 zone. and a test of the trend line will test near 1.39 Attached Image (click to enlarge) -------------------------------- Another interesting things to share is USD/CHF short chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) The uptrend was broken and it went to test the previous resistance at trend line. I did a short here and target to TP around the triangle price. You might question why I use trend line and break out , 1 2 3 pattern to do my Heavy / Support Resistance Thread. The answer is simple, they are inter-related and provide firmer entry / exit. Basically price often touch a heavy support / resistance and then decide the next movement. Should Support or Resistance Hold the price in trend, the price will move from the support to the resistance. But sometime when the price break the trend, the heavy support / resistance will draw price towards it and most people place stop loss and entry there. While wipeout the losers, and bring in new volume, the price will move faster towards the trend. Just like the USD chf chart which I depict it will fall after touch the resistance. ##################### Attached Image (click to enlarge) Many people would short GBP/USD or EUR/USD at the current level, thinking they are "too high" or so. However yesterday I mention I will long them on market open, I went in with 0.9 volume on G/U and now is up near 20 pips as I went in this early asia market price around 7x to low 8x I also went in EUR/USD long and USD/CHF short, I don't think price got high or low, but we need monitor the trend and watch for break out. When trend break, if you read on 1,2,3 pattern it will actually not go down at 1 go, price will move as normal then fall on touch the opposite resistance/support and continue its new trend. Stop Loss is important for Forex Survival too.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Another Chart I would like to share is this. EUR/GBP LONG Attached Image (click to enlarge) I fancy a long here . with support holding and a break out of the down trend . I anticipate E/G will rise over time. The movement of 1,2,3 pattern is this way. Step 1 Break out of trend Step 2 Went back to test support (if break out of down trend) &lt;- EUR/GBP current position Went back to test resistance (if break out of up trend) &lt;- Not applicable as this is a break out of down trend. Step 3 Continue going down (if down trend) Continue going up (if uptrend) In regards to step 2, normally it would test a heavy support or resistance. Not just a small 1. Take note: My technical analysis might WENT wrong if Fundamental news affect it, so always trade with STOP LOSS. Inserted Video

Nice thread... With a 4k account...what lot size do you recommend to use ?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
1. How much you expect to make 2. How long you been trading 3. Are you winning or losing overall in your trading As for me, I trade about at least 1 lot per pair with 500x leverage.I am more of a scalper so i always play 1 lot and aim at least 10 pips of scalp to 30 pips approx the lot size really depend how confident you are . And also how experience you are.if you are new. Dont play too big and risk everything in 1 session

Expect some movement at GBP news. Probably downside in my opinion. Time will reveal. A break of 1.6810 target lower movement towards 1.6803 and maybe will test 1.6780 maybe today or so.. However a higher move towards 1.6889 and breach through will target 1.7025 I fancy the downside more than the upside for current wave.

I am not greedy, all I ask is just another 20-30 pips for each account I open with short. This is against the trend play. But I just keep it there because I am comfortable with what I am doing.

Did you try out UJ and EJ long for now ? They seems to be in the trend line. I quite excited about whether NZD will hike rates or not.

3 Possible Entries of EUR/USD Short Attached Image (click to enlarge) I favor a short with 50 pips SL if entry at current price. But for more safe trader, can entry at safer spot. Next week we will have EUR Flash Estimate on Inflation. I favor downside for EURO before the news. The trend itself seems downside. IT could be point 2 for what EURO is doing now. Remember the 1 2 3 pattern. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Step 2 also can be 1.3830 - 1.3840 range. But nothing is confirm in forex. Just that we analyze trend and follow it to ride some small profits.

If anyone did follow this post yesterday, they will make at least 20-30 pips per entry. ########################################## This is my best week of trading session for this year 2014. What I change in my trading style is 1) I constantly withdrawing profit and keep my equity at a certain level ( Fxpro have a feature call Fx Vault where temporary hold my money.) 2) I use trend line to join the trend. I use heavy support/resistance zone as additional reason for entry. 3) I take profit when price seems to stuck / struggle and I re-entry when I am confident that the trend will resume. ---------------------------- &gt; This week I make near 150% ROI . I din't risk all my money in 1 session, I just entry at the right spot. &gt;My best winner is Gold LONG at 1272 and close at 1290 which account for almost 1/3 of my profit this week. I post my live chart at this thread most of the time. 1 thing I realize that &gt; Trader should not add to loser e.g after 30-50 pips and give excuses like market maker are pushing price up or down . &gt; Trader should look out for other opportunity to make money while your 'running' bad trade are losing money. &gt; You should not be discourage to look to open opposite trade against your original trade because whatever you open won't change the market movement, what will happen will still happen. What you need do is keep earn more winning trades and increase your equity. ------------------ Example if you long EUR/USD, you should not be shy to long USD/CHF although its opposite, you need not put all your egg at 1 side. As long trend line reveal the direction, heavy support &amp; resistance give you the green light, just go ahead. I realize usage of trend line and analyze chart , price action make my entry almost perfect. I trade big lot size, with tight stop loss. I lose 4 trades this week, I open more than 100 trade positions . The trades that I lose is because they are still unrealized loss and still running. I din't really bother my original trade, I just open the trade base on price action &amp; trend, support/resistance, I don't care if its against my original trades. My purpose is just to make more money to my accounts. With more equity, I can get more opportunity trading. Money management is important also, such as transfer winning back to my vault. and not to my account because if I lose everything in accounts, I need not transfer money from my credit card into my accounts. Do join this thread to post trend chart &amp; support/resistance chart, because the more people join, the more chances we would not miss out any possible winning opportunity.

The coming week is filled with exciting news. Euro Inflation Data - I expect EURO to touch 1.38 or lower before the news - position covering. So a scalp at the current price 1.3830 can reap some profit. We also have payroll data, and the UK GDP q/q, the expectation was 0.9%, quite high in fact. JPY monetary statement which will affect the yen crosses. I expect more stimulus and yen pairs to rise. but all we need to see is price action &amp; trend line. ====== I saw this blog &gt; http://ibankcoin.com/flyblog/ &lt; from forexlive commentary, this guy state he win a lot of money and recently QUIT the stock market after losing 32% year to date, I read his recent blog post and knew he is doom to fail. Holding losing stocks for 8 consecutive weeks. Below are pointers to make ourselves successful. - Never hope a trade will go your direction, if you open a position and you know you are in the right trend, it will go your way, no need to "hope". - Never add to your loser too much, you will really get kick out of the game if its a big trend. - Never add position just because you got no position, rather add because there a trend with heavy support/resistance - Use STOP LOSS or put a limited amount of money in account. - Lastly, the most common term here in Forex Factory is the "Market Maker" term which some traders are trying to guess what the big players are doing, I just think you don't have to know what they doing, rather ride the trend and get some pips out of it. There also a lot of discussion on forexfactory in regards whether scalper made money. 1 thing about scalper is we don't lose big money, because our position are small and short. unless the scalper break the rule and hold a position by extend stop loss or add to loser. Good luck next week, a lot of money to come. Play the Pounds, Euro &amp; Yen crosses next week will be fun. Should EURO &amp; pounds fall, the best hedge is commodities, which will gain favor, especially NZD.

Not sure if it make sense. But its useful if you are short EUR/USD just like me. Nomura Article on efxNews: http://www.efxnews.com/story/23962/e...decline-nomura Theres 2 take profit zone . 1.3790 area or 1.3660 zone. I prefer to take at 1.3790 and then re-short after ECB inflation data (depends on the data outlook) Of course I will like to use trend line &amp; heavy support/resistance for entry and not blind faith. ** If you did look at the chart i post on 3 points of eur/usd short entry on friday *** You will notice that the 1 2 3 pattern , which step 3 lies on the 1.3790 area too.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Kudos to chaosbun for starting this thread Good system that you have there. It is very interesting to know that someone who would risk more than they actually get, but this is a good stuff to be true, as you tend to secure more of the profit to tank the losses. May i ask, which session do you usually trade though?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Hihi, thanks for respond to my thread and the compliment. I trade mostly during London &amp; New York Session, sometime I trade Asia Session if there is fundamental news on that period, e.g AUD, NZD or CNY news. I just wait for news to breakout and watch my trend line &amp; support/resistance. Actually yea I sometime risk like 40 pips and get only 20 pips back. Although my R:R is quite weird. i manage to make back twice my equity last week. I been winning for 3 months consistent since my 3rd year of trading. I trying to refine my trading method by adding trend line 2 weeks ago, the result was quite good. I think the main thing of trading is to not go against the trend and not add to loser. Money management &amp; risk management is important but if keep go into wrong entry will also lead to lose case. Also limit your loss per trade, using stop loss or just use a limited amount of money in your account. My case is that I have 8 Mt4 account in FxPro , and some money at my Fxpro Vault. When I see a good entry, yet I want seperate from my main account due to the lot size too big or so. I will fund my extra account with money and open the trade, close the mt4 and wait for it to earn enough, relogin the mt4 account and close position, transfer all the money back to my fxpro vault. I also set stop loss for my trade at main accounts. Chart analyze is quite important also.. like the 1 2 3 pattern, the trendline breakout idealogy, the entry using heavy support &amp; resistance. with this 3 thing, its sufficient to make a living, or even big &amp; fast money. A lot people prefer the safe approach of making 1-10% a month, I prefer to make 100% and above per month. But main thing is not to lose my capital. Let's have earn big bucks this week Look forwards for more people contribute potential trend line entry or heavy support / resistance chart.

In this risk aversion asia session, the currency that got hit the most is EURO, as from my phone app I can see euro drop the most in this risk aversion due to japan yen retail sales issue. Perhaps the risk aversion will give further weight on EURO pairs. Don't really look forwards to long any euro pair until EURO inflation data past with result as expected. Some support at near range thou for EUR/USD, which 1.3782 is the strongest for breakout. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will go with the approach of adding euro position at the high/upside of the down trend line or low of support (probably at 1.3780 - 1.3800 zone) depend on situation.

Fear strike us when we are in losing pips. But i find eur usd and usd chf as a golden opportunity for week earning. Invest well and you good to go. However always trade with a limited loss. Some say this upmove is gap filling. To me its a test of the daily downtrend line. Could it be the step 2 of 1 2 3 pattern on the earlier upmove. When time dues we will see if euro will touch 1.3790 first or break 1.39 This move could also for the big player to close their short at the high. Its quite common on eventful week.

Greetings, chaosbun. I would like to ask you something. How many times will a trend line or horizontal support/resistance be tested? Thank you

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Sold eur/nzd, taken profit +30 pips ! thanks chaosbun.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
This question answer is actually no answer. Sometime the trend line can hold 3 times, sometime 4 times, sometime 5 times, its random. Just that normally its a good entry if you got a good heavy support/resistance at the price too. Expect some "break through" or some range again. Never use anything below H1 for trend line drawing. Daily Trend is stronger than H4 Trend H4 trend is stronger than H1 Trend. Took profit on EUR/USD short, EUR/NZD short, USD/CHF long, EUR/GBP short My weekly return of investment is more than 50% (ratio to my Equity). Withdrawing profits now More battle to go on for this week. We have upcoming EURO Inflation Data &amp; FOMC Statement. I got no EURO position now, I going sit out and watch the price first.

Will be following this thread Pretty much a simple system yet effective though. Just playing out with probability and a good way to secure pips into the pips bank. I am normally a intraweek trader which i will hold till the Friday, but the problem recently with the market is that it often tend to reverse and hit my trail stop. Last year was really smooth trading year for me, but after the government shutdown, eurozone inflationary problem, china credit crunch or shadow banking, and recently sanctions going on for vladimir's pussy doing , all just stacked up and caused the market to be cuckooing all day long. Therefore, your scalping system will help to secure pips as much as possible though, for example gbpusd had been hitting the roof for like 5 times or more, so if for like a intraweek trader like me, will get frustrated as the pips that I initially obtained lose all out just like that. Thanks, chaosbun, allow me to learn more in this thread Anyways, for your sl do u usually put your sl above the trend line + 15 pips or so , or above the horizontal resistance or support?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I don't set Stop loss. I close them myself. Most of the time, 90% of my trade won't make me panic. If I playing a risky bet, I will transfer e.g $500 to 1 of my account, assume I Play 1.0 lot which is $10 per pip, the account will auto wipeout at 50 pips, so its okay. I have 8 mt4 account at fxpro to perform my money management. When I win, I just transfer the money back to my FxPro Vault. Yes this days, the market don't move as much range as what it used to be, we need adapt to changes. Scalping can be pretty profitable. For this week I already make 50% of my equity. Its pretty a large sum to me. There still more to go, the probability to win at trend line and heavy support/resistance is quite high. Sometime when you hold a trade for too long, your gain is gone, and it reset to either 0 or a loss. So I tend to close trade in 10 - 30 pips, I hold longer if the trade seems good. And 0.2 lot , when you have 20 pips profit, its $40 , multiply by my 8 accounts , its $300+ dollars in a very short duration. of course if lose, the 8 accounts are all affected, but I only do the same trade at all accounts when the win rate is higher. Then winning a few of those trade in a day, will make a thousand dollar earning in a day. My account equity is roughly keep at a same level, surplus are keep at the Vault for backup. Most of the time if a trade is good, I will mimic the same trade across 8 accounts and 0.2 lot - 0.4 lot each, which account to a few lot. and when I close them, all my accounts equity is higher than what it originally was. Having more equity means you have more financial freedom to entry more good positions. Inserted Video

Euro is showing weakness. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It slightly breach the uptrend line. A break of 1.3790 should see further downside. However try not to short now. Because its seem very risky. Euro/Usd seems to find some bid at 1.3810 I might want join a long position at 1.3790 , depend on situation. When EURO and Pound Fall.

Trading for the New York Session My Bias: USD Bull 1) ADP Non Farm Employment Change - Not sure if its reachable, but if possible, USD will be strong. 2) Advance GDP q/q (easy achieveable as the expected is really low) - Expect only 1.2% when prior was 2.6% 3) FOMC Statement - Market expect 10b cut and I don't think is price in yet Lastly - Euro did gain strength , but its weakness will surface when USD is in favor, because no matter what , EURO Inflation did not reach as expected , the Core CPI was fine, but the overall CPI is still weak at 0.7%. Not to forget the rise of Inflation was partly due to Easter Sales. The trendline for EURO daily downside is still intact. I favor a EUR/USD short for tonight. I might be wrong, but this is my position ahead of upcoming heavy impact USD releases. -------- There are also market rumors going on -------------- Leveraged accounts sell EUR/JPY There are sellers in EUR/USD 1.3830-40 (high 1.3836) so it makes sense. -------------------------------------------- We will either see 1.3870 first or we will see 1.38 break again. This is not a good trend line play or a heavy support/resistance play, just my little small entries for a small profit in supportive of USD news tonight.

EURUSD 1.3800 (EUR 673m) 1.3815 (USD 691m) 1.3835 1.3850 (EUR 800m) ​This could be maybe 1 of the reason why euro won't fall. We might see some actions after option expiry at ISM Manufacturing PMI release hour and the party squaring up their position and its friday tommorow. Just a extra piece of information. Trade safe my fellow traders

Not seeing any heavy support for this USDJPY trade to go long......

--- 帖子 #253 ---
USD JPY heavy support was at 101.9x near 102 zone. It was push up as you can see in the past 24 hours happening to that chart. USD/JPY also up about 20 pips in the past short few hours because of US yield touch support at 2.60 and bounce to 2.63 now. Well they are related - US Yield &amp; USD/JPY pair &gt;&gt; http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/10_year --- Positioning --- I just close some of my eu short open @ 1.3884 on price 1.3861 to reduce my exposure, now my SL stretch as far as near for the rest of my positions 1.4 and I am confident for tonight play because of the wide SL and E/U trendline play Lets earn some profit. I got no idea if NFP will be as good as expected, but its always better to trade safe. Don't over trade than what your account size can tolerate.

So tempted to short eur/usd now. Trend seems good I scalped yesterday for small profit..waited 2 hours no big movement down..

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Chaosbun good call on the EURUSD I jumped in at 1.3865 and stayed with it till the NFP for 50 pips you sure do have a great eye for the trend lines, support and resistance, I am hoping to learn from you and I thank you for being so generous to show what you do in your post and like to wish you all the very best

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Thanks for the compliment. I look forward more people joining the thread to post chart of heavy support/resistance paired up with trendline More poster = more opportunity reveal Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
position close in small profit. not keeping for weekend news.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Question...as you can see AUDUSD broke the support "officially" but jump right back...so that is a plus.. Do you care that support was broken and it may go lower to the next support at 9163? Could of been brokers hunting stops, but still broken...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
The support was firm at 0.9200, even if breakout, it can provide another move up then down again. Just like what you see now. 30 pips from the chart.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Added usd/cad long, usd/jpy long, eur/usd short USD/CAD and USD/JPY is base on heavy support. EUR/USD short is base on trendline. I WANT to have a peaceful weekend. seems hard !

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Okay all close again. totally 0 positions now, close in around 10 pips profit each haha.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Look at the reversals lol.. I had aud/usd short open, eurjpy long , usdjpy long before nfp.. but i prefer not take risk and close all for small pips.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I had aud usd long open at 0.9220 which is a few post earlier but because its friday so I close, you can trace the thread lol. I knew it will go up, just that I am content with my week performance. Now i got 0 positions, just open that 3 positions and close in minutes lol. quite happy with the profit. Adding position at key support/resistance (HEAVY not small s/r), and trend line will really increase your win edge dramatically. Learn to take profit and not be over greedy. Once you used to it should be fine.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Conclude my weekly performance: This week I made over 100% Return of investment, it was a week of roller coaster. I made some mistake, such as open position base on my own speculation without trendline &amp; heavy support/resistance , but this trade luckily was close today in small profit. There was also period of time where E/U going near 1.39 but I did not falter although I did have some fear and did more planning. I believe in my trendline &amp; support/resistance system, I been adding positions up there when the price is near break out. I also did some withdrawal at different period of time on my accounts to reduce my equity , in case my account blown up due to unexpected fundamental reasons, my damage will not be too intensive. This week I open more than 150 positions, and lose 0 position. Some was close for few pips profit, some was close for more than 40 pips profit. The range is quite limited, but the earning is awesome as the price keep bounce around in a small range. Trend line is pretty reliable, and I did some money management too. I hope you guys win some money and see you guys again next week . Its tough to be a dollar bull !

Added USD/CHF Long - H1 Trendline play. Attached Image (click to enlarge) H4 Trendline is just 12 pips below.

USD Yield facing heavy support Attached Image And how is this related to any pair ? Yes it is related to USD/JPY long I open a UJ long - small position. I intend open 1 more at trend line 102.06 approx.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
This thread does not promote market speculation or market maker theory. We look on Trend Line &amp; Heavy Support / Resistance. We don't have to know why market move, we just need to know when it about to move, we join them. Keep it simple stupid This technical skill using trend line &amp; identify price action using Heavy S/R should be easy to adapt. Hope some of you guys have a better profitable weeks after look carefully at chart.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi Chaosbun just like to ask if you do not mind, my Broker is AxiTrader in Australia and I notice that it does not match up to your charts so can I ask who is your broker so that I can look up to see if they have Demo accounts , also it seems that you look at longer time frames and than work down to 60 min, to open trades is that correct regards Allan

--- 帖子 #274 ---
My broker is FxPro . I normally have a glance and remember roughly the key entry price &amp; the trend line at, for major pair like EU,GU,UJ,AU,NU etc. If there is a big movement, i will check h1 first, if h1 trend is broke, I will check if h4 got a trend, then d1. I also look for heavy support / resistance, the term heavy is because at high timeframe, previous support/resistance that result in large pips on the next candle are mostly some zone that buyer &amp; seller hiding at. You will get to know more about this kind of trading scalping strategy that I am using after posting chart often here and we can pin point each other entry and make the best out of it. The range is very tight for the past 2 weeks, but it make me very good money. at least 200% roi for just 2 weeks. I open over 300 positions and 0 was close in loss. 20%-30% was close in profit less than 10 pips. The rest was close somewhere higher. 10 - 50 pips I been trading for 3 years 3 months, my consistent earning start 3 months ago, and this heavy support/resistance system initially rely on just Support &amp; Resistance, but after refine and adding trend line, the entry got more precise and beautiful. Result in very good money. ---- This system is very easy to use, all you need do is draw trend line and and draw s/r line at heavy support/resistance, read some fundamental news and do your entry, its work very well for me, and able to adapt to tight &amp; wide trending / ranging market situation. Some system only work for certain market condition, such as those system that hold positions for hundred of pips will not work for such tight market situation and lose potential profit. Just see last week chart, euro got hit down, went up, hit down again, went up. Repeatly. and other pairs too, just grinding on those movement and all those little and small pips crumble together will form you big fat money. Joining trend is important, at least 1 thing is you won't lose money , as most trader lose money for going against the trend . Second thing is you can actually make a lot of profit if you on the right trend.

Hi Chaosbun, nice to see somebody from singapore here too !!, hope i can learn trading forex with you cheers !!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Chaosbun, I support your way of trading and tread wholeheartedly , and read every post to learn from everybody. I had a look at your USDCHF trade (post 270) and after putting TrendLines on it looked as if price is moving in a channel, so i made the 4H chart a LineChart and added the "Equidistance Channel" indicator to it and as you can see from my Screenshot, everything just fell in place, for the down trend as well as the present trend. Thans for all your effert.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi FibFork, thanks for this chart. Yeah I do agree that now is a good time to add a USD/CHF long as its fall at the good price of a trend. I draw manually H1 and H4 line for USD/CHF on friday, the price is around your line too Look forwards for more trend and support/resistance player to join this thread Weekend news: France pm say euro is too strong. &gt; http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/0...0DJ0H420140503 Ukraine says heavy fighting in Kramatorsk, war descends in its east &gt; http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/...0NP08T20140503

--- 帖子 #280 ---
hi, where can I get "Equidistance Channel" indicator?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
USDJPY possible buy at 101.6 stop at 101.15. But not sure where is TP.. either it goes back up or coming down in new channel. So i will be careful this one

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I went in USD/JPY base on heavy support at the current price. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The better level to entry will be 101.54 - 101.6 zone for a trendline play. ------------------------- I also added a usd chf as it break trendline and it retrace up due to the buying there . Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another 1 I add is EUR/USD short as its near the heavy Resistance at 1.388x zone with stronger 1 at 1.3906 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart Entry is just for technical analysis of the market movement, fundamental can still change the way the chart suppose to be. Trade with SL and trade with what you can afford to lose.

What i see on GOLD

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Your gold trend line seems wrong. You seems to create that trend line high merge with current price which is not settle down yet. I think that high is not consider trend line point 2 unless it open new candle and fall some amount. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Gold seems bullish in the case of break out, adding short at near 1327 zone seems a better high probability bet than adding now The only issue is with the trend line high merge to the current price, other than that your charts seems okay. Your resistance line seems okay also. I can't predict the future too haha Trade safe Base on the nature of pattern 1,2,3 . To form point 2, it likely form near 1327 (nearby resistance of notable volume), whereby then it will fall and then uptrend again. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The key trend change for Gold will most probably battle out near 1327, however gold rally quite an amount after the break out, 1318 and 1324 could be the resistance to form point 2, which near 1327 will be the deciding factor for trend change. Higher up would be 1342. the next key resistance Expect more movement at new york session as london market close today .

I am in the NZDUSD long maybe only about 20 pips

--- 帖子 #296 ---
basically you look for a line so strong, the price bounces off, and you go the other way with it. I look the other way at a price so strong it pushes through a line that previously held it. A pattern is only broken for a good reason. Just watch out for the first break it could be a "trap". Let it come back to the line and "kiss it good bye. Its just the opposite side of the same coin. The more pairs you watch , the more often you see these things. When a pair comes into profit, scalp it. Let it come back a bit, and when it turns again, scalp it again. (do not try to scalp a pair not already in profit) Does this make any sense to you or am I just F.O.C.?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Your trendline seems wrong. you don't have point 2 But a long at that position aiming for near 0.8700 could work out, but I would maybe add short near 0.8700

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I would draw trend line connect high or low together using H1 , H4 or D1 chart. Next I look for heavy support / resistance, and when the price get near, I look for the reaction, does trend line hold the price in range, is there a heavy resistance/support there, if it does , I will add my position. I also look out for nearby heavy support/resistance to see if the price does break up, what will happen.

You are correct I went short from the 01/05/14 due to pullback from 30/04/14.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I think you should not include the current swing or current price to construct the trendline. Use the last two older swings that already have finished to form, because you current swing is still in the process of forming.

--- 帖子 #308 ---

--- 帖子 #312 ---
USD is very weak now. Market don't like the toilet paper. Trend breakout and rebounce should be near, GBP/USD short seems high probability with USD/CHF long EUR/USD i am unsure, NZD/USD short is also another pair I looking to short.

hello Chaos, im from malaysia. i like ur trading method, clean and easy. i'm a stock trader,exploring to forex.. market downturn kind of boring lol. my question is: approx how long for each time you open a position? what is the duration? few hours? few days? on average please? I m not familiar with forex so I need some guidance, especially about what time is more suitable to trade in forex? (I searched a little bit and try out some different times...) Our Time: Lunch hour: boring...nothing to see I noticed usually after 4pm it's more active (london open) and throughout evening till .... is still active? kindly shed some lights for me.... many thanks...

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Also, I had tested on a few positions using ur method...here it goes. 1. tested on EURJPY TF15m (Screenshot5.png - sorry im not sure how to rename the screenshot upload???) position: Short size: 1.00 EP: 142.00 TP: 141.73 SL: 142.14 It was a 27pips won position. &gt;&gt; I wasn't sure bout what TP to go for so I set it at the immediate Resistance area (highlighted with Oval). &gt;&gt; The Blue-colored rectangular are the extreme Support/Resistance area right?(In your context) 2. tested on EURGBP TF 1Hr (screenshot 6.png) position: Long size: 1.00 EP: 0.8198 TP: 0.8223 SL: 0.8180 still open and have unrealised P/L up n down. &gt;&gt; again, Im not sure where to set the TP except the congested area where prices lie heavily. &gt;&gt; Also, My EP was just depending on the reversal area where I see it's a Extreme support (the rectangular area) and I simply enter the position when I see there's some bull/bear in the area (probably i'd went to lower TF to seek entry, i've forgotten ) ---------------- Hope you can comment and give me some guidance. My few new questions are: 1. Am I getting your ideas right? 2. If yes, how should I determine the EP? 3. How to determine the TP? 4. When you do the trigger, will you go into lower timeframe to seek entry or just depending on the same chart (eg. 1hr or 4hr chart to seek entry) 5. How long you leave the position open? 6. Does it work well with lower timeframe or too much whipsaw?(probably i should try out by myself lol) so far these are what I can come up with... thanks... note: the vertical line in both screenshot is when I do the trade. the red slope line in screenshot5 is where my position hits the TP... took about 2hrs... SF

EUR-USD is giving maturing sale sign, you should expect to confirm a false start, accompanied by strong bearish divergence

Ahh yes...I did a short position earlier but got wiped out. just re-entered another short position with this pair... where should I set the TP ? (I'm on demo, no worries. I just need guidance :S)

Hi All I was in the nzdusd short now out for 56 pips ( heads up from chaosbun thank you ) was in gbpusd short due to heavy resistance but out now for 8 pips due to pin bar hope good trading for all... I am still struggling with it but getting there I hope the boss is ok and not unwell

Did anyone win euro/usd ? Its make me a fortune this week. I just close at 1.385x, I added 2 positions at 1.3970 earlier on , a batch of positions at 1.3930-40. Happy week I also added a lot of usd chf. I closed my 2 lots GBP/usd and change to eur/usd before the news. Luckily Draghi jawbone it down.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I am busily withdraw money. will post charts soon There few charts for you guys to play if you interested EUR/GBP long - near heavy support USD/CAD long - near heavy support AUD/USD short - near heavy resistance.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
As short as 10 minutes, as long as a few days or 1 week. I normally keep it short &amp; simple.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
If you entry there you probably win now.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
EUR/GBP Weekly Chart , we can see there a heavy support at 0.81541, not far from current level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I entry at the current price as I am comfortable with the entry and I have a stop as big as 100 pips. I aiming for a 30-50 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
AUD/USD Short Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am comfortable with this short. There is a heavy resistance just not much higher. The other thing is Governor Steven always jawbone down AUD and say AUD is overvalue when AUD is at the current price or 0.9400, I don't expect AUD to be very strong . Taking in this entry with heavy resistance as my key reason. My stop is as wide as 100 pips for safe trading. Nobody knows how the price going move, be careful trading.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
USD/CAD Long Attached Image (click to enlarge) I not sure if anyone saw this. But it does show that previously when price touch this zone, it rebounce up. This is a daily chart. I play this chart in anticipate of the heavy support at this level.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Lastly the key thing is, always trade within your means . Don't over trade and don't trade what you can't afford to lose . Following strict discipline with entry base on heavy support or heavy resistance with Trend Line(if exist) and understand the fundamental behind it, will help your trading journey be more smooth and profitable.

--- 帖子 #326 ---

--- 帖子 #333 ---
can you tell us what is your TP for this??? Are you looking at 102.75 extreme Resistance ?? or are you looking only at the nearest Resistance area 102.00 zone? kindly advise

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Trade that I going carry over weekend - EUR/USD long - EUR/JPY long ( just added at 139.94 ) - GBP/USD long - NZD/USD long ( just added ) This week was a eventful week for me at least. I was losing most of my trades open last friday and then win back on ECB press conference yesterday with bonus money, making this week a profitable week. Currently I not doing quite well with my EU and GU long, but I still like the price as of now. Only GU seems a bit problematic. I like my NU long position as the price is nice, I believe it will move up next week. I just don't like USD for this moment. No matter what, my trades might not work, the key thing is to open base on heavy support/resistance with Trend line, lacking any of them will lead to some unforeseen losses. Have a good weekend. This will be my 3rd profitable week since adding trendline, and my 3 months 3 weeks of winning since my 3rd year of trading.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
101.9x - 102.10 seems a resistance zone, you might want tp near 102. Depend on your appetite for JPY pairs, and how much you wanna earn for this trade session. I close mine at the current price and went to long NZD/USD instead.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
As an example EURJPY broke all of the support so playing it long is a bad idea.. I am trading same sort of technique, maybe will go long at the monthly resistance 2 I do have Long USDJPY, much better trade....

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I think UJ was a better long because its have a trend line too as the reason for long. EJ was quite plain speculate that support will hold. Just praying support will hold will kills your account, just like it did for my GU as I "thought" the support will hold but it keep falling. But luckily I wasn't playing big enough to make an impact to my week performance, its my leftover money at accounts after my withdrawal. --------------- I love NZD/USD long at least for the next week. I can't be sure things will work out well, but NZD/USD have a pattern if anyone realize it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Reason 1 was that it is near heavy support - h4 chart The other reason is this Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you notice, price touch support, then it might break a few resistances or so, then go to pivot again. The next day, price might be attract to previous day support/resistance, it keep going in a loop. As for the friday close, price was at support 2, my general idea is price will either go to monday pivot (high + low / 2 of friday) around 0.8630 or price will go to Resistance 1 which is 0.86677. However my key reason is still I like this heavy support ( base on chart 1 ) . And holding NZD/USD is rewarding for its interest or swap to some people (carry cost) If NZD/USD range is intact, it will go back test the 0.877 high. Should downside prevail, the next KEY support is at 0.8510. I playing 200 pips for NZD/USD at my singapore broker which is 50x leverage, so this trade is pretty good for me. And holding the trade make me free holding cost in daily basis.

Chaosbun, trend lines can be tricky but supports are obvious...but I agree, just S/R will not do it...... Do you or anyone has a good indi for automatic trend lines generation? And Yes, I have searched....

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Did anyone test this indicator and see if its work? I not very sure if one should use trend line indicator. Anyway for today my positioning is NZD/USD long ( same . heavy support idealogy ) EUR/USD long (37-49 zone got some moving average with heavy support) EUR/GBP long (support broken but seems fine at 40 zone) I close my EJ long at 139.94 - 140.00 last week at 30 earlier on.

My position ahead of Euro CPI release in less than 24 hours time.. EUR/USD long &amp; EUR/JPY long. EUR/USD had some decent support at 1.3680, EUR/JPY had strong support at 10 to 30 zone.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I had EU short @ 1.3687, still n profit. waiting it to trend lower as downtrend is strong (EU did have a strong support @ 1.3680zone but i traded based on continuation breakout )

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Personally long GU at low 50 and EU at low 50 also. Both close for around 40 pips each. I now longing USD/JPY, buyer spotted at 101.30, might be a rebounce up when yellen speaks later or fall might resume till near 101. I favor the upside, I also added USD/CHF long as the trend breakout earlier on with heavy support at 90 zone.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
if you want a sudden rush of risk:reward do this trade Support is within 50 pips - 2 heavy support. Trend is touch 4 times, I suspect a breakout soon, perhaps to the upside after such a strong downtrend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) E/J long, the trendline is not clear cause I zoom out, you can draw it yourself and you will understand what I mean. Another support chart is UJ Attached Image (click to enlarge) Heavy support at 30 zone, which is 20 pips away. I think jpy crosses like UJ , EJ seems nice to play. I am on it, with tight stop loss.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
This week was my first losing week . Reason was because most of my trade was base on speculation and not on trendline etc. This week was full of fundamental news that bring down risk pairs and causes large amount of risk aversion . I cut all my positions at wednesday and then did some trend line &amp; heavy support position. Then I won some at thursday and my loss was minimize, my saving did not reduce but my trading balance reduce by 1/4, the loss was cut much because the loss suppose be 1/2 of my trading balance. But glad I cut my loss and bet big on trend line and heavy support such as my GU and EU position at the low which bag me 40 pips each, and the lot size was big because the SL was tight too. Have a nice weekend guys. Currently for the next week I look forwards for UJ and EJ position to make some pips . A Example of UJ Down trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A test of the trendline will bring price close to 102, which at current level will be quite rewarding, a break through will breach 102 resistance. The support hold quite well for several instances as you can see on the chart . A break lower will test 100.6 Another JPY crosses I took is EJ long which can be seen here Attached Image (click to enlarge) The support also holding. and it seems the trend line is tested 4 times. A reversal will breach trendline and test 139.40 which is the closest resistance follow by 139.70 then ultimately 140.70

Hello, On the chart more S / R lines are shown as black arrows. Do you have they draw by hand or use an indicator that it draws automatically?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Receive 2 personal message over the weekend regarding my system. To make thing simple, my chart candle is Heiken Ashi, because I think its more beautiful than normal candle. But if no heiken ashi, I would go for Japanese Candlestick. 1 of the private message talks about support &amp; resistance could be draw any places. Yeah its true, the same chart, given the same drawing, could be depict differently by different traders. I use trend line to know how the price is moving, 1 thing I realize for this week and the past few weeks of success trading is - Never speculate, assume you draw a trend line, price going touch the trend line and you expect it to "bounce", actually no. You can only expect it to bounce when there sort of support or resistance at that price previously, you need to set "Stop Loss" of limited amount of pips, prefer 20 - 30 pips or below to limit your risk. For case of Trend Break out, if price stay out of the trend for a while, in ranging market, after that price will decide the next move, most probably towards the downside if its break out of a uptrend so vice versa. Most positions that are lost in trading are mostly due to lack of discipline. I start to realize patience is important, money should be keep and use on the best opportunity. In the past, I like to open positions and make sure there something running in my account, not to waste the time. But better than keeping a position in red, its wiser to wait for the best chance and get a position in green. 1 more thing is Risk:Reward is quite important. Assume my account, most of the time i keep it at $300 usd, i got like 5 to 6 accounts. When I got a good entry, I will enter that use like 90% of my equity, and I will set SL to lets say 20 to 30 pips, and if I lose, I will mostly down 40% equity. Most of the time my risk is amount of $100 - $200 usd. My reward is about 0.7 to 2.0 of what I risk. Actually how much I risk is not the issue because as long I set SL and accept the risk, and get a proper entry. Red pips won't even appear, the only fear is when a trade is losing, the stop loss is extend, causing the risk to double or triple or even blown an account, very typical mistake of my past which I stop doing.

AUD/USD broken out of its downtrend, and is poise for more upside gain. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will wait and monitor price movement before doing a long entry. Take note of upcoming aud related news like monetary minutes etc could cause big movement. A good entry would be at price near 0.9380 and not near 0.9400 with SL stretch to the 60s as the 70s got strong support with trend line support. This pair could be very dangerous towards risk or rewards as the aud news could shake 1 off.

Thanks for the kind words. Together we learn and correct our mistake, and most important is to be consistent in making money.

I closed my short at 1.7134 earlier on before post the chart at around 18 or so , taking a mere 15 pips profit as I need leave for dinner and prefer not to leave the trade running. &gt;Anyway a couple of minutes ago GU touch the low again and bounce. It could be a warning that buyer is spotted at there and GU could rally much higher. &gt;I initiate a long on GU and EURCHF at current price. with limited stop loss around 30 pips each. Both carry certain level of risk, but EURCHF should be safer. 1 thing I do most of the time is i will switch to M1 chart to watch price action at the level that I monitoring. But my trend line &amp; Heavy support/resistance is mainly base on H1 or H4 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)
