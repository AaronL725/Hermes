Happs combines price levels derived from the Historical High, and Low of a given pair, with phase levels derived from Fib ratios. Happs is different from any other phase type system in the sense that it requires no new adjustments from the month to month. Its levels are static, unless a new historical high or low has been made in a pair. In this case, it would need to be recalculated. Happs also combines concepts of Supply and Demand with S/R pivot trading into one system. I believe both of these concepts need to be understood and taken into consideration in order to make consistently effective trades. There is a little bit of a learning curve here, but its not rocket science. The complete explanation of the system, including its process of development, is provided in the text document below. This is a newly developed system-but I hope people will find it interesting, useful, and helpful. If it makes sense to you, and it works in demo-then great! But always demo trade first! To make your own templates for different pairs follow this process: 1) Place Happs V8 indicator on your chart. 2) If you want to use different values for the Hist. high and low than appear in your Monthly data, you must input them manually. Otherwise your monthly high and low will automatically be used by default. 3) Choose if you want secondary zones and fibs to appear. 4) If you want to increase the number of Happs levels, then increase the "Factor" setting to 64 or 128. If you want bigger levels for viewing on Larger TF's such as weekly, monthly, and possibly Daily, then lower the "Factor" setting to 16 or 8. 5) In Properties, change the chart background to either Dark Kahki or Steel Blue for best visibility. Then turn off the grid. 6) Readjust the colors of your Happs lines and levels in the V8 indicator to optimize viewing. 7) Save as template. You're done. (Make sure you are running MT4 build 500 or higher) Summary of Trade-ability/Usefulness: Happs was originally designed to be an open-ended system which could be used in numerous ways to find trades. It still is meant to be that. With that said, I can also admit that when the system was first designed, I really didn't have the best idea how to use it most effectively in trading. I just knew that I was onto something that was pretty good, and potentially very useful. So now after three years of practice and development I can give some better advice on how to use it most effectively in trading, or at least share what has worked best for me. The most typical kind of trade I take with the Happs system includes confluences of technical elements with the Primary Zones. As in, a Primary Zone + a Trendline + Divergence on the Stochastics. These types of trades are easy to identify and have worked out well for me. Follow the link below for a very typical example. This is a trade that I took on GU yesterday. Hidden bearish divergence was confirmed on the H4, then price retraced into a confluence of a Primary Zone and downward sloping Trendline. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...65#post6713765 I consider the Mids and the Secondary Zones to be generally weaker areas than the Primary zones. So in order to trade out of these areas I usually want to see a little better technical setup than I would need to see if the confluence was occurring in a Primary. This is how the different technical areas of Happs color my thinking when considering trade opportunities. Troubleshooting: If you're putting the Happs_Phases_Add indicator on your chart and you know that the values it is giving for the high and low of the pair are wrong, then chances are that you don't have good data loaded into your platform. This will happen especially if you are just downloading a new platform for the first time, usually demo. So what you must do is: 1) go to Tools&gt;History Center&gt;Currency Pair&gt;Monthly TF, in your MT4 platform. 2) Then highlight Monthly TF, then click download. 3) It will give you a little pop up blurb, so click OK. 4) Then the new data will take about 4 or 5 minutes to download. That should correct any problems. **Happs V8 requires MT4 build 500 or higher to operate. Always happy to answer questions. Thanks, enjoy. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Important How and Why it Works Posts: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...79#post4882879 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...47#post4886947 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...10#post4887210 Good Charting Examples: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...85#post4892985 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...04#post4960904 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...19#post4893519 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...99#post4904299 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Updates: 10/09/10: Due to differences in the hist. opening price of various brokers, to make things more objective, and to keep everyone on the same page with their values, instead of using the historical opening for the middle value, we're simply using the average between the high and the low price. The basic harmonics at work come through just as well this way, and it elimates a great deal of confusion and problems. Pat has created a great Indicator for this system, which is still a bit of a work in progress, but its working fine. Just place it on any pair, input the high, low, and average of the high and low, where you see the "Open" value on the indicator. I'm inlcuding the indicator below, as well as the preset templates for the EU and the GU. Thanks very much to Pat for the great work! 8/30/11 FerruFx has contributed a great add on to the Happs V4 indicator. It does the following: 1) It extends the SD zones (colored rectangles) completely across the screen so you don't have to flip back and forth between time frames to get the rectangles to update themselves. It also just looks better having them go completely across. 2) It gives you an option to display the high and low price of any pair that you apply it to. This way if you want to make your own templates, you don't have to go through the hassle of tracking down the historical high and low for the pair. These are both great conveniences and exactly what the indicator needed. So a big round of applause to Ferru for his great job! I've included the indicator below. "Happs_Phases_Add" Just put it on your chart in addition to the regular Happs Indicator. Also, I've updated the EU template to include the Happs_Phases_Add Indicator. 6/15/2012 Introduced the concept of secondary S/D zones and provided a few templates to illustrate the idea. See this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...66#post5765766 5/20/2013 The Happs Indicator has been updated to its final version V8. Thanks to Pat1 for an amazing job in producing a very robust version of the Happs system in a trading indicator. Changes Made: 1) Automatic Search of Historical High and Low based on your monthly chart data. No need to manually input the high and low any longer. 2) Capacity to manually override the automatic values with values of your choosing. 3) Secondary Zones will appear if you choose this option. 4) Factor Setting: This controls how many levels deep you want the Happs system to go between the high and low prices. a) 32 is the default standard Happs chart. Leaving "Factor" at its default of 32 will produce a regular Happs chart. b) Setting it to 64 will produce 2x as many 50% levels, thus making the levels half the size as the default. Setting it to 128 will give you 1/4size levels, or micro-Happs. Some traders like to use this setting for scalping on the 5 min chart. c) going lower than the default to 16 or 8 will make the levels larger, for viewing on the weekly TF, for example. 5) Total control over the color of all lines and levels on the chart, for optimized custom viewing. 6) Rectangles now stretch all the way across your chart without the need for an additional indicator. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

thx stevex i appreatiate your work and sharing.... thanks i will study this regards lodol

Your very welcome lodol. Happy Pipping!

Hello stevfx, Is this development an inspiration of aboonaci?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi, In the loosest sense, yes. I was very clear and explicit in my text document the exact extent to which Aebab inspired this template. That is just in the sense that he made me aware that a phase system would work well with the historical work I was already doing. He just got me thinking about a phase structure in general. The actual way the structure was derived has basically nothing to do with his work. It is different in just about every respect. And both he and Old Dog are credited in the text document for helping to provide that bit of insipiration. Thanks for your question!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
A good start Steve!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
So here is a simple breakdown of the system, which I will post in a series of charts.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Using Fibs.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Good work steve we may need .. to make some indicator based on .. this it would be very helpful.. Looking forward to this Cheers

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi Steve i just read the txt file .. is there anyway u can explain all things in a simple manner i know u tried hard in the text.. but may be again step by step? thanks

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Also how do u determine the Hist High LOW Open?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Hoichoi, go to your monthly chart to get the hist. high, low and open of a pair. I'll try to flesh out the system a little at a time, and make it simple for people. Its basically a price analysis system, which makes it easy to spot good trade opportunities, and also which trades to stay out of. I'll be posting more on it soon. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
An example how the happs lines make it obvious.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Happs price patterns.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Happs organizes trades.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Anyway, as complicated as the set-up seems, this is all this system was really made to do. It just organizes price into meaningful levels and patterns to help you more easily identify profitable trading opportunities. Thats basically it.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Stevefx I understand the part to look for monthly chart to get historical high and low but how do u find historical open? do you refert to last month candle or historical high of few months/ few years?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi Steve What a wonderful tool for trading this is. Areas of high demand/supply already set out..... areas where price may reverse / continue set out ......... any time frame we like.....no need to worry about these areas until price reaches all time high / lows. All we need now is a little price action......maybe trend lines and we are done....can't get easier then that Many thanks Steve, really looking forward to give this template a go. Cheers Ezzy

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hey Ezzy, I'm happy you get it! Was feeling a little lost there for moment . Best of luck with it-let me know how it goes!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Its the first monthly candle on the chart, all the way to the left. The 4rth month of 1989. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Steve Trendstar &amp; Breakout EA fit well into this price structured by HAPPS. Fibs is one area I have not learned about at all, but now with trading with HAPPS I can learn as price interacts with all the different levels to determine the areas of confluence more clearly. "I concluded: behavior within the basic structure may change based on this or that, but not the basic structure. To trade most effectively, the changing behavior of price should be viewed in relation to the basic structure, not the other way around." I like your conclusion, it makes sense to me. Great work. I think you have a natural gift to create. by the way: This EA I found on another forum is simple, but it contains supertrend nrp new as the only indi for trade signals.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hey Ian, thanks a lot! Yep, happs is good in the sense that it doesn't take anything away-you can add whatever you want to it, and it doesn't mind at all. We all have a natural gift to create, you too. Create away!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Steve The points of confluence are excellent here Oct 4 04:00 IBFX chart : S/D Pivot Zone above Red ATR line above weekly pivot supertrend green : settings 34,0,1 21ema A nice example of many weeks to come.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Steve, Thanks for sharing. I can find the High and Low on the monthly charts but how do you find the open between those 2 values (the High and Low found are not in the same month) ? And you need this value to calculat the 50% first rank values. Thx for helping. Regards Erik

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Erik, I'm guessing your asking this because you want to make a happ chart for another pair? Thats cool. I was going to do 4 all together, GY, GU, and EJ, in addition to the EU. They're just a lot of work to do so I'm taking a little breather. But to find the hist. open go to the first candle on your monthly chart. You've got to scroll all the way back to the left so make sure the "auto scroll" is turned off. If its a bull candle the opening price is the bottom of the body. If its a bear candle the open price is the top of the body. But if you hover your cursor over the candle the info for OHL of the candle should pop up.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Steve, nice work! Erik, also you have to go to Tools Menu, Options, Charts, and in the Max bars in History and Max bars in Chart drop menus, you have to input 250000, to be sure you are getting all the bars. regards G

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi G, Thanks very much! Glad to have you here.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Steve Hope I am not asking to much, but I am wondering, how to have the red/green areas across the chart...they see to stopped where I have marked with a horizontal line. Any help will be greatly appreciated. PS. By the way, I am 140 + pips from yesterdays 4hour bounce of the red S/D line. Cheers again Ezzy

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Forgot the chart...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Ezzy, To make the rectangles current, zoom out to the 4hr chart. Then double click on a rectangle until you see the dots show up around it. (double click on one of the corners) Then right click on it. Then select "rectangle properties" Then you just change the date in the lower box. Great to hear about the positive results!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Great to see Ian. I hope you got out when price hit the bottom of the green box. Unless price is in a real breakout, on first approach sellers are going to step in there. Then you saw how it got bought up right above the lower pivot. All good trading opps. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Steve, Appreciate the tremendous work you put in this. I only want to understand and reproduce your work. But is the first monthly candle the same for everyone ? On my Alpari-UK chart this is : High = 1.6035 Low = 0.8219 Open = Bullcandle 1989.07.01 = bottom = open = 1.0079 50% first rank values = (1.6035 - 1.0079) / 2 + 1.0079 = 1.3057 Can't find this line on you chart. Sorry but I'am only try to understand the basics. Kind regards Erik

--- 帖子 #33 ---
All fixed, thanks Steve. It will be interesting to see how price reacts to the next S/D zone particularly given it will be just over 1.400

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Erik, there may be some discrepancies between brokers. I use IBFX which shows me the candle going back to the 4rth month of 1989. The open price it gives is 1.0446. I noticed that one of the pics Ezzy posted showed the price shifted off about 5 points from mine. Sometimes things just don't translate from one broker to another with different GMT offset times. But you have the math process right. Subtract the open from the high, divide by two, then add the remainder to the open, and you get the first rank level. You can't find the 1st rank line on my chart at the price you mention because we have a 400 point discrepancy in our open prices. You might want to go with the earlier data price. (our high and low prices do match)

"Great to see Ian. I hope you got out when price hit the bottom of the green box. Unless price is in a real breakout, on first approach sellers are going to step in there. Then you saw how it got bought up right above the lower pivot. All good trading opps. Cheers!" Hi Steve On that example of a start of the week trade, I was out at the blue ATR line as I had entered at the red ATR line. For weeks to come though I was certainly encouraged to see how well happs integrated with Monster Muncher &amp; Trendstar. All your excellent creative hard work is making a trade like the EURUSD one possible with a high probability of success. Now it is time to practice, practice &amp; practice. I am making a template for AUDUSD here it is so far, but I need to work on it much more. By the way, if you would like, then I will be happy to pay for an .ex4 indicator to be made up of happs. For example ,I really like the coding work of professional coder FerruFx who is here at Forexfactory or Steve Hopwood. Steve is even one of FerruFx vouchers. (Members who have vouched for FerruFx, earliest first: smjones, Piters, FOREXflash, SteveHopwood) please PM me if you would like to proceed in this direction.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I guess you got answer Ezzy- you called it, in the basement. ----------------- Little review, we've had some good hits so far. It got sold off on first approach of the lower SD zone. Then it got picked up right over the Mid Pivot. Retraced at 38.2 of the higher area. Caught support right at 100/0 SD pivot. Got brought up to the next SD zone, and sold again. Again, these are good results, but so far as trading goes, remember all Happs can do is make you aware of places where things are likely to happen, so you can be ready if it does. You always need the market to let you know, and then follow along. As a trader, I'm a follower. So just important to remember this is not a signal machine, but just a tool to help you look at price and make sense out of it.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Glad you got out on that in the right place Ian. No troubles about paying for an indy. No reason to spend money on it. The charts can be made 1 by 1 over time. And maybe eventually a coder will take an interest. After we've banked 10,000 pips, lol. Thanks though. I went over your template for the AU. The first thing you have to do is set your H-lines right, before adding a lot of other stuff, or it gets too confusing and makes it harder to be accurate. In the case of the AU, the low is almost twice as far from the opening price as the high. So the best thing to do here is to use only 4 ranks from the opening to the high, and 5 ranks from the opening to the low, so you get roughly evenly spaced levels. We also had a difference in our opening data prices. I have .8006, from the 3rd month of 1989. Anyway I got you started. Just fill in the rest of the levels from the opening to the high, and you'll be set for a good while.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Steve I appreciate your help. Please bear with me as I learn to construct the happs template. It is a big learning curve for me. I will read through the instructions again &amp; ask questions as I go along. I can see the result of learning this will be very helpful for understanding &amp; identifying points of confluence more accurately. Our mind can be like a missile once it locks onto a target. 10,000 pips you can certainly get them.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Steve, Nice work...well though out and objectively determined. Subscribed. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks for your encouragement Cunuck!, glad to have you here.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I look forward to you posting some trade setups within your framework....and some templates for other pairs. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Just taking a look at the Daily. You can see some patterns change. To me this reflects some loss of cofidence in bulls at these levels. Doesn't mean the bears have it-but this a genuine struggle for control. For the time being smart money bulls are still good. If the lower Mid Pivot gets broken, then you know something might be going on.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
How come when I load the template the green and red stripes stop back on October 6th? Thanks so much for the great thread...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I see the same thing. Can someone please comment? Thanks! Dennis

He replied to this in Post #30..here you go: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...4&amp;postcount=30

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Steve, very impressive indeed! Areas of Supply &amp; Demand stick out like a sore thumb on your template. I must say however I haven't yet been able to replicate this myself (though I haven't given up yet). For example the historical open is 1.0446, which I don't see ploted anywhere. The for historical High &amp; Low do we should be using the absolute H &amp; L ever? I don't think it is the H &amp; L of that first month's candle? Already challenegd by the first steps I am already scratching my head. Anyway, perhaps step by step instructions how you construct this illustrated with screen shots would be golden. Thanks for sharing your insight! t

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi teemo, I'm not sure about the way the open was plotted on the first template I posted, there should be a red line there. I made some small corrections over the past few days even though the original I posted was pretty straight. Anyway, this one definitely shows the open price in the right place. Red lines show open high and low. I also had the ultimate fibs upside down which I corrected on this template. These are also updated with the rectangles through to the 10th. --------------------------------------------- Ok, Instructions for making the happs charts -------------------------------------------- Yes, historical high-highest high ever made in the pair, and lowest low ever made, along with the open. There's been some confusion about open price due to data differences between brokers. The value I used is: 1.0446. Those are your first three lines. 1)So just plot those lines. 2)Then put lines half way between those three. That gives you two more lines-those are your 1st rank 50% lines. Make them a different color than the ones you used for the H,L,O. 3)Now put a line half way between each line on the chart. You will get 4 new lines. Those are your 2nd rank 50% lines. Make them a different color than HLO, or 1st rank lines. All second rank lines should be the same color as each other, but different than HLO, or 1st rank 4)Now put another set of lines halfway between each line on the chart. These are your 3rd rank 50% lines. Make them a different color as the others, but the same color as each other. 5)Do this once more to get 4rth rank 50% lines, 6)and once more again to get 5th rank 50% lines. So, get your H-lines plotted right, HLO, and 1-5th rank 50% lines. Then I usually insert a text blurb so I can remember which color stands for what rank. ----------------------------------------- Now you have to make the SD Pivot Zones, these are the colored rectangles. Only the H,L,O, and 1st through 4rth rank lines get these rectangles placed around them. 5th rank 50% lines do not. To determine the correct distance which the rectangles should be placed away from the 1st through 4rth rank lines-you must first determine the base phase height. To do this, just place your fibs from any 1st through 4rth rank line to the next nearest 1st through 4rth rank line, 100% to 0%. Thats the base phase height. Now starting at the 17% and extending to the 23.6% away from any 1st through 4rth rank 50% line is where the colored rectangle goes. Place a rectangle in that area-then change the dates so it extends from way back when to the present. Now your rectangle should be placed 17% to 23% base phase hieght away from your 1st through 4rth rank 50% line. On the lower side of your 1st through 4rth rank line, you need to do the same thing. Put a rectangle 17% to 23% base phase hieght below your 1st through 4rth rank 50% line. Then adjust the date. When placing a rectangle below a 1st through 4rth rank line, the easiest thing to do is-when you determine the base phase hieght, instead of putting the 100% on the higher line, put the 100% on the lower line, and the 0% on the higher line. This will show the ratios upside down, to make it easier for you to place the rectangle below. Now that you have your rectangles placed around your 1st through 4rth rank line, all you have to do is set your fibs inside of it. The 100/0% S/D Pivot Label goes right in the center of one rectangle, and another 100/0% S/D pivot Label goes in the center of the lower rectangle. The 50% fib line should hit your 1st through 4rth rank 50% line. Label the 50% fib line, "50% Mid S/D Pivot" Now you've done a level. Repeat this process at the next higher or lower 1st through 4rth rank 50% line. In the large space between the lower rectangle of one level, and the higher rectangle of another, is where you place your larger phase fibs. Just start them right at the center of the lower rectangle from the higher level, and end them right at the center of the higher rectangle from the lower level. Change the 50% fib label to "Mid Pivot", extend the dates, etc. Now you have done a complete phase. Thats basically it. Just repeat the process until its all filled in. ------------------------------------ attached below is the template with the small corrections.

Here is an indi that will draw the phases. As of now it does not draw the fibs between phases nor shows Historical high ,low, and open but will include that in the next version if required. The input is obvious. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Wow, thanks Pat, it looks great. I only see two problems. It erases the fibs if you place them manually when you switch time frames. And its not placing the levels from the open to the low. I know thats a little more complicated, because you have a different schemes spatially from the open to the low, than from the open to the high. Maybe the easiest thing to do is just make a separate indicator for the levels from the open to the low. Anyway, I very much appreciate your work. If you want to update it so it automatically fills in the fibs that would be great. That would take care of the problem of its erasing manually placed fibs. However you want to go about it, or not at all... What you've done already is very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Here's a screenshot from the GU using the indy. Can't get a pic of recent price on this yet because GU is ranging between Open and Low right now, and the indy doesn't yet make those levels. But here's some past data, looks nice.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
That's great thanks...

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thank You Kindly Steve - Great Explanation &amp; Support! Looking at that chart you can truly see the levels where all these big block orders have been executed. Various time frame candle patterns clearly show how price literally races away from those areas due to supply/demand imbalances (too much demand in relation to available supply &amp; vice versa). I really liked the levels created when Historial High &amp; Low were divided into 50% segments all the way to tradeable phases (+/- 120 pips on EURUSD), disregarding Historical Open. Definitely a chart set-up I will be looking at in the long term for my trading. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Pat, thanks for creating this indi. Steve, how are you determining the "Open" price. I see in Pat's indi that a value of 1.04608 is used as the Open. Is there a certain date attached to this? Regards, Marc

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Marc, I'm using the data I have from IBFX. The earliest candle on the Monthly for the EU comes from the 4rth month of 1989. Gives the opening value as 1.0446. Its hitting all the highs and lows very nicely, but if someone has an earlier or somehow better value, they can certainly post it. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Ok. I understand now. I do have data back to 1/1/1989. Open for the month was 1.173

--- 帖子 #56 ---
With your suggestion for the "Open" price I've used Pat's indi to create the chart for A/U. Wow! You are definitely on to something Steve.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I only see two problems. It erases the fibs if you place them manually when you switch time frames. And its not placing the levels from the open to the low. I know thats a little more complicated, because you have a different schemes spatially from the open to the low, than from the open to the high. Steve, Based on your previous post regarding au where the diff between the open and low was twice that of between high and open, you suggested using 5th rank instead of 4 for below open vs above open so that the phase range of the above and below are close. Using the indi below("v2), enter the value of "0" for H_Open and the phases will be plot from high to low. The reason for this suggestion is that the currently the selection of H_Open is arbitrary, due to, I am assuming here( and everyone knows what "ass_u_me" means) , of the limitations of data availability. If for instance if we had data from DEC 1997 for a particular symbol we would have had to use that as H_Open and not June 1989 as we do for EU. However, the H_High and H_Low are defined by the market. Another solution maybe to establish a minimum value of the phase range, say 100 pips( this makes it arbitrary again), and the factoring of the space between High - Open and Open - Low should be done such that Max factoring would be upto the fourth rank while the minimum would be "0' such that the minimum factoring phase range is always greater than the user defined value, 100 pips in this example. This has not been programmed into version 2. The following indi will draw some fibs, 23, 38, 62 and 77 based on the period of the chart. for example, if the chart is daily or above it will not draw the fibs. If the chart is H4 chart, only the 38 and 62 fibs are drawn. Anything below H4, all of the above mentioned fibs will be drawn. The Fibs around the 50% of the Large phase are all magenta while the other ones are white. 38 and 62 are dashed style while 23 and 77 are dotted lines. All colors however, are user selectable. In other words, all you have to do is Attach the indi to any chart with approriate input data and you can switch the periods of the chart and the indi will draw fibs based on the period of the chart. IMHO, it reduces clutter. Just try it on EU, and randomly change the period of the chart to know what I mean. The indi does draw H,O,L but they are is not quite visible at the moment. You can see them in the Object List of the chart. I will address that issue in the next version. Have not come up with a way to indicate the rank of the phase lines either, such as what you have suggested with different colored lines, but that will implementedi in future versions. Another suggestion that comes to mind is making the colors of the congestion/buysell rectangles same instead of red and green as red typically indicates sell, short, stop, reverse etc and reverse of the green. Any darker or lighter shade of the background should work well. Cheers Pat PS Did the Euro come to being in 1989?

Steve If the Historic High, Low, and Open values of all currency pairs can be tabulated, than it can be programmed into the indi which would eliminate inputting of those values. I am not sure if different broker feeds would have variation in values? Either that or just post a table of values in the first post so everyone is in the same page so to speak. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I knew it wouldn't be long before tools for this approach would be developed. Kudos to Pat. I would suggest that Steve either indicate what the values are for each pair and program them into the indicator or save some templates for each pair and add to post one...just do something so there are not 12 different variations for the same pair. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I hear you Canuck. Possibly the best solution is to switch to something more objective than using the Hist Open. Check out this picture of the EU, where for the middle value I simply used the average between the high and the low. It does just as good, if not a better job than using the open. And with this there can be no discrepancies-everyone has the same high and low values.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You need to work it out...and then trade it for some time going forward...but you need to decide what/how to use to build the zones...so that everyone who might follow the thread is looking at the same charts. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Steve, with your suggestion about using the avg of the high and low for the "open" I created a new chart below for A/U. A/U because that's the pair I mainly trade. Looks good!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks Marc, I think so also. It picks up the underlying harmonics on all of the pairs I've used it on. So, in the name objectivity, to get everyone on the same page with their values, and to resolve the coding issues-lets use the high, low, and average.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Might I suggest you update the first post with this information...and place a few templates there. Cheers CanuckCT

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks Canuck, I wasn't planning to neglect that. I thought I'd look over the work pat has done on V2 first, to see if I can come up with some constructive feedback. I'm working on it, my friend, thanks.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Pat, I just first wanted to say thanks very much for your great work. I think changing the color of the rectangles to a neutral color is a fine idea. The way you've alternated the views is also fine, very ingenious. The main difficulty I see is that the indicator erases any object placed on it, such as a trendline if the user switches timeframes. This is sort of key, since it takes aways people's ability to customize their chart to their liking. If there is a way you could fix that, that would be great. Aside from that, its all working. Thanks again, very much, great work!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Ok, front page is all updated. Thanks very much to everyone for their input. Rome wasn't built in a day! It'll get there. Now I need some rest. A good night to all.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It looks even better on a 15pips rangebars charts 2- senerio 1. When green on top sell when red on bottom buy 2. when red on top sell when green on bottom buy

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I am neutral at the current price -- I will sell at the red line above or buy on the red line below

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I think thats a sensible view, zamanib. You always have to be careful entering a position right above or below these colored areas, as price can tend to reverse right around them. Demand falls off, and supply steps in, even though GU is above its buying support ATM. It looks good, but can be a trap. Thanks for sharing your outlook!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Steve This looks great the old EURUSD template has the SD pivot zone above the red ATR line this past week, but this new template lines up the SD pivot zone nicely with the red ATR line on H1. ............................................................... post edited as I removed my idea.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
could you please clarify - are you referring to price bars, horizontal lines, I'm just not sure what you mean - pls help out 1. When green on top sell when red on bottom buy 2. when red on top sell when green on bottom buy thanks alot traderdp

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks very much Ian, but I'm not sure that these two systems really go together very well. When you try to do too much sometimes it creates more of a clutter than a clear view. A better bet might be just to use some stochastics along with indi, to get aligned signals working in accord with the movements off the different levels.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I learn as I go. You are correct. I am doing too much. I will give stochs a go on demo.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
First posted trade with this system. Shorting EC. Target is 3368.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Version 3 changes: Removed H_Open Calculations are based on 4th rank factoring between midpoint and two end points. Only objects created by the indi would be managed by the indi. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thanks Pat. Here's the difference between the two on A/U. The 1st chart is v2 with the avg of the high and low as the "open". Chart two is of v3. I actually like the v2 chart better on this pair using the avg of the H and L as the O.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Can you post the numbers you have for AUDUSD for entering into the indi with version 2 indi please

--- 帖子 #79 ---
9917 7346 4775

--- 帖子 #80 ---
The version 3 was for 5th rank factoring Version 4 is 4th rank factoring. Thanks Marc

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thanks very much Pat, great work as always. I'm not going to tell people if they should use 4rth or 5th rank factoring-I'll let them decide what they like best for themselves. Can you please post the version with 5th rank factoring that doesn't manage all the objects on the chart? Then I'll post those two versions on the first page. Superb-thanks! -One last change I can suggest is to extend the rectangles out two to five days into the future, if this is possible. Sometimes prices outruns them, the way they are set right now. Thanks again.

50 pips in this sluggest market today -- the resistance and support is clear -- But I have not seen a detail explanation how to trade it

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Glad you got some good pips Zam. I've already expressed my ideas how to use the Happs system, both in the text documents, and in the various posted charts. This is an open-ended system to be used for price analysis. There are no strict rules as such. It was not meant to be that type of system. Good job again with the GU trade.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Anyway, I'm out of this trade +75. Missed my target by 13 pips, chickened out.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Tonight's trade, long on the EU. Chart explains my thinking. But, for all I know, I could lose.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Steve, I'm already making good pips by keeping the Happs chart up on one of my screens. Pat, thanks again for creating the indi. You have a special talent I can only dream of having.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Very happy to hear Marcum, thats whats it for -though not on my last trade in particular- stopped out -8. Will try again later from lower.

I should have spotted the rejection off the pivot, and traded it for that. Mud in my eyes. Or I could have bought the bounce off the lower pivot when it occured, if I was awake. I am not so sleepy though as to forget to say that this is not the thread to be advertising your proprietary software in. You get away with what you do in your own thread. But unless you want to post the MQ4 file for everyone to download tradewin free of charge, I suggest that you don't post the results from that system anymore, here. You'll also notice that I post my trades before they have won or lost, not after the fact. This way they are of some edifying value. Only warning Zam.

Thats fine by me-good luck with the side business.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Well, lets see if I can redeem myself from my 8 point loss on the EU trade. Here is a Short on GY. Selling at supply, plus pullback behind 21 EMA, plus trend direction. Target the 100% retrace, 230 points. Partial profits at the nearer pivot, and lock the whole thing positive there.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
+40 ATM. 129.70 is going to be a tough nut. Could bounce here. TP some and resell bounce is a thought.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
It did in fact bounce where I thought it might. Got out safely in profit. Here is some extended analysis for GJ. Bearish flag. The technical target for a short position would be 405 points from E, wherever that finally falls. Could be 130.49 to 130.91. Pushing past 131.10 is bad news for a short.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
EC broke its trendline, but the daily picture is still bullish. Just coming out of a demand area, pullback behind 21 EMA on daily, tends to drive up the price. Not a very good buy in its current position either. Will be looking to see how it reacts off its lower levels, maybe get in near lower pivot.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Au is in a meaningful pullback area for longs. Bottom of H1 channel. H1 stochs in the right place. Middle of H4 channel. H4 shows how it got bought right up under 21 ema. 30.9-38.2% area of current zone.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Broken LTL on GJ. Selling should begin. Have one short open, but could retest upper pivot. GBP/CHF rejected at 62.8 of current phase. Also near top of H4 channel with stochs at top and ready to descend. Should retest bottom. Short open there. Profits taken on AU +45.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Stopped on GC -25. GJ short positions running, doing fine.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
+20 taken on GJ at bottom of range. If it breaks I'll kick myself, but I don't like holding over the weekend. More likely to hit the top first anyway. Been an OK week.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Bearish pins on Daily don't tell the whole story. 4140 is a key level for EU and there is bound to be some selling off it. EU scraped the bottom of its H4 channel on test, but held. The top of the Daily Channel has been scraped more. Bearish expanding pattern in place but need to see some rejection off lower level in order for it to be carried out. As long EU keeps making higher highs, buyers will keep buying. Safest bet right now is long to 4031. *error on H1 chart, should read test area 4031-4081

--- 帖子 #102 ---
GJ Bear flag pattern is moving along pretty nicely. Expected spikey has occured, and formed bearish wedge around it. Here are some ideas for entry. 130.27 might be the sweet spot for selling a bounce. I will be looking for shorts here for next week.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Long EU target area 4021-4031. Short UCAD target area 1.0069. Short GY @ 130.12. target open. Based on H4 my entry on UCAD could be early. Might push up to 1.0150 to complete its movement in the H4 channel. GY also might feel some pain for entering early. Market has come out a lot more bearish than I expected. I try to manage my money to accomodate these situations. EU is in the right place at the right time.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hello Steve, Nice and interesting thread. I like it. I don't quite understand why this thread isn't getting more posts, the concept seems great to me. I have a question : We could identify historical areas of S/D based initially on the High / Low / average of the trading range. These ranges will stay the same unless historical high/low is broken. Well, if this high/low is broken, then the S/D areas will change, and the historically proven S/D areas suddenly could be NON S/D areas. We could get complete new areas of S/D and S/R. How to deal with this? Greetings Edja

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Edja, The only way you need to deal with it is to adjust the high and low values on your indicator. It will automatically readjust the zones. Thanks for your question.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Stopped -30 on EU and UC. Profits taken on GJ +115. My conclusion from these trades is, unless what you have is supersolid like the flag signal on GJ, don't trade against Supertrend on the H1.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Mostly I'm going to be posting pullback trades from here on out. This is a system came up with some time back. Happs enhances it by giving meaningful entry and exit points. The idea is to trade with the main trend in a given time frame, by getting in on pullbacks behind the 21 EMA. One way would be to buy or sell at the first meaningful Happs level behind the 21 EMA. On the posted chart for GJ, the ideal short entry would be 129.30. I made two small entries just short of that. On very strong bearish moves, it might be neccessary to switch to a lower time frame to get a pullback entry, because you won't get one on the H1, due to the way bears tend to sell of fast. Bulls almost always offer an entry on the H1. There's no magic here, you can drawdown. Aim small, miss small.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I'm out on GJ +30. It might go, but it looks too much like accumulation under the weekly S1 for my liking.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I'm long on EC at the pivot. I'm trying to do 2 things in posting these trades. First, limit my exposure by only being in one trade at a time. 2nd, make sure that both the H4 and H1 time frames support the trade. In the case of EC, they do. There's a higher low, near pullback on Daily behind 21 EMA. I basically don't see why it shouldn't hit the top again.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Steve And many thanks for the new template (GJ). It is great to see how price reacts to these levels. Also just wondering if you have a template for EJ. Cheers mate. PS - Loving your work!!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Ezzy-thanks! Somehow the V2 got included with the last template posted. This one has the V4 with EJ prices. Also included is Weekly Pivots. Everyone should be aware of weekly pivot and support levels. You can put this template on other pairs. Just change the High and Low on the Happs Indi to match the high and low of the pair you want to put it on.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Alrighty, I'm out of EC +30. I'm actually +40 on the pair cause I took a 10 point scalp earlier. This one probly has a lot more in it, but I'm too tired to stay up and watch it. I made 70 pips today! No losers . One trade at a time. Really is important.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi Steve I am having a few weeks off forex well I am working during the weekdays until mid to late November. Some nice charts you have been posting. Excellent work. Here is a couple of useful indicators. If the pivot auto pirate still has any loading problems then Pivot points multitime frame indicator is the same one without any bugs. The supertrend nrp alert indicator. Finally here is a stoch indicator that includes momentum. (Blau - double smoother stochastic) It is just a little smoother. MarcVUM trades exceptionally well. One of the indicators MarcVUM uses &amp; kindly shared with me is SMI(2) . This one I have posted is exactly the same just a different name with one additional setting choice. All the best with your trades.

Not too many great opps tonight. Basically we have a lot of pairs that have moved down to their weekly or daily support levels. Or Res. levels in the case of UCAD. So unless you want trade against the H1 and H4 by picking tops and bottoms, it needs waiting for pullbacks. Only trade I can find is GC, long. Doesn't look too bullish to me, but H1 and H4 agree I should be buying off this level. Will keep posting them as I find them.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Steve Going to have lots of fun with this one. Cheers

why is this thread dead because this is good imo

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi Steve how are you doing ? I hope you are keeping well. I have been learning a lot from Sam Seiden lately. I started trading again at the start of December. Happs has been invaluable. Your idea is extremely effective. It is giving me a sense of market price action structure. I mainly post over at Saxon thread. Nearly Naked (Simple Trades). MarcVUM and some other excellent traders post over there too. All the best to you. I hope your having a good hoilday season. Ian

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi Steve, Hope you are well, and also hope this thread comes back alive some time as I think there is more to explore. From so many threads I read this one has impacted my analysis profoundly. In the early posts of this thread I kinda struggled to clearly understand a few of the steps you use to build HAPPS levels. So I came up with something which I truly don't know is what you intended it to be or not - but looks good to me. My Euro Futures chart looks like this....don't get mad as I know you have something a bit different.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
No problem teemo. Whatever works for you. My intention was always just to give something to people that they could make their own. I'm happy you have been able to do that. Keep your chin up!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hmm, don't see V4 on the front page. Will fix that soon.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I guess a few people may have noticed that I took a little time off from trading and from FF and from this thread. Some people have PM'd me over the past few months to let me know that the Happs system has really helped them or otherwise deeply influenced their views on trading, and still others have wondered why the thread died, given that the substance of the Happs system seemed very good and promising. To the former group of people I would like to say sorry I haven't been able to answer you straight-away, needed some time off. But I'm glad that you've been able to get something good out of it, and sort of humbled and touched in a way. To the latter group of people, and to traders in general who have had an interest in this system, I can only say that most likely I'm a 10x better analyst and systems developer than I am a trader. So partly due to personal frustrations, and wanting to do other things, I took some time off. But also because it seemed that I was pretty much carrying the thread on my own. I figured if the interest was substantial enough then things would carry on without me for a while. Anyway that about sums it up. ------------------------------------------- Happs Review The Happs system isn't a stand-alone system, and wasn't meant to be. Its more of a helper system-it helps to highlight critical points of S/R and make a trader more easily aware of potentially profitable trading opportunities, and turning points. By applying the indicator to the chart, inputting the historical high and low of a given pair, it should become obvious how it can help to do that. You can see how price works off the levels it produces. So individual traders need to bring other skills to the table in order to make effective use of it. I'm definitely interested in seeing and hearing people's ideas of how to apply further analysis to a Happs chart in order to formulate trades. I have a few of my own, but the floor is open.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I am sorry Steve - I didn't realize some activity started on this thread again. HAPPS is one of the most fascinating models I have ever seen, largely also in it's simplicity. As you mentioned a few posts back this is not a trading system - it is a Concept. I do not trade on an MT4 platform; so I can't use the Indicator and do it all manually. In fact I haven't even traded Forex for quite some time; I only trade Futures and within that market only trade three currencies (sometimes a 4th - Swissy). I realize you may say: this guy didn't get it? But the only area where I struggle a little is while continuously plotting 50% down the TF's deciding which of those 50%'ers are the more significant ones. So besides considering major ones from larger TF's more important I use my usual trading tools (TL's, S/R, Fibs, Patterns) to find good confluence with all HAPPS levels. Though I am probably not quite using this concept the way I should be, it has been on my screen since this thread started and I love it - it has added heaps of confidence to my trading! Thanks Steve!! I am re-subscribing to this thread; perhaps we can do more with this.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi Teemo, Thanks for showing your support for the Happs idea. It seems to me like you've found a good method for using Happs. There really is no right or wrong way to use it as such, since its main purpose is only to point your eyes to important price levels where turning points may occur. I think using other tools along with Happs, as you are doing, is basically essential. You really can't use it on its own (I guess that would be the only wrong way), any more than you can use Murrey Math on its own. It just goes along with other techniques to help reenforce your ideas, find confluences, show important levels, etc.... To me that seems to be how you are looking at it, so its good. Finding which are the most important levels at a given time will always be the challenge-even minor levels can play important roles sometimes. Again this just comes back to integrating other tools and methods of analysis to help you figure it out. Lately I've been doing a lot of work with TMA's, wonderful indi, but I guess you can't get that on the futures platform either. Hopefully I can get back into Happs to explore some more fully fleshed out trading methods at some point not too far down the road. But feel free to post your charts and ideas here with your own cool version of Happs. Thanks, Stephen

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Though I have years of experience with various Fib tools, your concept has lit a bulb in my head that the areas at &amp; surrounding 50% are the most significant ones - imho more important than the over rated 61.8% I'll be glad to post some charts Steve! Cheers, t

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Is there any further development of the system?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Pol, thanks for your inquiry. I'm working on some new stuff, which is sort of Happs related. Complete system without indi's except for MA's to help with exits and filter entries. Mostly its just a price movement system though. Don't want to release anything yet til I do some forward testing. Backtesting looks really nice so far though. Maybe details to come at the end of the week. Take Care-Steve.

Those are the symbol names for the pairs. Euro/USD=EU, Euro/JPY=EJ, GBP/USD=GU, GBP/JPY=GJ

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thank you! And that means the line white, red, green, yellow, magenta ?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
No, sorry, it means just what I said it means. They are symbol names for the currency crosses. The colors that you refer to are the various colors for the different lines on the Happs chart-totally different things. I'm afraid I can't be much more to help to you on these matters. Just make sure that you apply the Euro/Usd template to a Euro/Usd chart, a GU template to a GU chart, and so on. Best of Luck-

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hey I haven't posted here in a while. I made a Micro-Happs chart for EU, and its good for either scalping or taking 20-40 pips off the 5 min chart. The regular happs levels have been miniaturized to about 1/4 the normal size. Intra-day levels hold up pretty well. I also use the TDI indi with the 5 min chart for catching bigger moves. For smaller moves just look for price action off the mids. Practice first! -Good Trading All

Hi Steve, I have been reading about your system and would love to work with it. I have been trying my best to convert over a ex4 file into my metatrader but I am having no luck. I even messed up and do not know how to fix my mistake. I opened the ex4 file with a local program on my computer Word doc and now when I try to save the ex4 file to my desktop it saves as a Word doc. Any help would be appreciated. Sincerely, ASCLARK1

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I'm not the best with the techy stuff. Try right clicking on it, then click "save target as". Then the box which allows you to name the file should pop up. Below that it should show file type with a dropdown. It should say EX4. If it doesn't, and the EX4 option doesn't show up anywhere. Then try putting in the .EX4 manually in the name box. If that doesn't work, then try renaming the file to .EX4 once its been saved as whatever. Other than that, once you have it saved in EX4 format, all you have to do is to cut, or copy and paste it into your experts&gt;indicators file. The only difference I believe between EX4 and MQ4 is that MQ4 can be recompiled, and EX4 can't. I didn't code the indi, so it wasn't my choice to put into EX4. Pat did that. But I don't really know enough about it to comment further. If you still have problems try "platform tech".

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Steve, Is it normal for the Happs EA to show in gray? Does it have to wait for the market to start before you can add it to the chart? On my computer it is gray'd out. just curious if you have had this happen before. Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Its not an EA. Its an indicator. Make sure its in your indicators file, not your experts file. It can be applied at any time, during market hours or non market hours. It will show up in color with colored lines. The indicator settings must have the right high and low which correspond with the historical high and low of the pair which you have applied it to. This is not hard. Put the indi into your experts&gt;indicators file. Then save the templates which I've provided above in post #136 into your templates file. Then just load the appropriate template onto the appropriate chart. EU template onto an EU chart, EJ template onto an EJ chart, etc. Bang, your in business. *note if you want the fibos to show up on the chart, then go to your indicators list, open up the Happs indi, and select the "true" under draw fibs option.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks Steve, I finally got it to work!!! I am excited about trying your system out. I understood it when I read it and I really like to watch for setups so this works well for me. Thanks again!

Micro chart for all you GU lovers. Works with the TDI indy. On this chart entry lines are yellow lines, and red lines are the harder mids. A lot of the yellow lines are not yet filled in on this chart. I'll update the chart later when we approach those areas. Should be just fine for now. Long is TDI=green over red, both lines over TDI mid (highlighted with blue horizontal), and price hits yellow line on chart from below Short is TDI=red over green, both lines under TDI mid, and price hits yellow line on chart from above. TF is 5 or 15 Min.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi stevefx Whats the precise difference between the levels drawn by the happs indi and the micro happs template. If One is using the indi will all the micro happs levels be present. Could you pls elaborate on what yellow lines and the "harder mids" in the micro happs correspond to in the happs indi levels. Thanks

--- 帖子 #155 ---
On the EU micro template, the difference is that the levels have been made 4x smaller than the full size Happs levels. On the GU template they are half the size. This is done to facilitate reasonable intraday trades. The red lines on the GU template are directly derivative of the Mid from the historical high and low for the GU. The yellow lines between them are 40/60% boundaries levels. If you look at the large happs charts, the phases are broken up into 40/60% splits between small and large phases. (on the EU micro chart the red lines are the boundaries (entry points), and the yellow and goldenrod lines are the mids) It stands to reason that over time the mids should be more difficult to penetrate than the boundaries between the mids. This is why it is suggested to enter at the boundaries (yellow lines) and not the mids (red lines). Does this mean that entries made at the red lines can't work, and entries made at the yellow line will always work? No, of course not. Its just more advantageous in general to enter at the softer levels. If you enter at a yellow (talking about GU template now) and get reversed on very quickly, a lot of times what it will do is pullback to the red line, and you can make another entry there if price action isn't too severe. Entries on a pullback offer better RR and I usually take them if I get the opportunity, unless price is moving against me with too much momentum. Hope that helps.

I tried the micro-happs GU template it works well please what are the rules for EU micro-happs template, REMAIN BLESSED.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Thanks. The rules for the EU template are basically the same, but the colors and the phase sizes are different. EU levels are twice as small as the GU template, and so it should only be used on the 5 min chart. On the EU template, the red lines are the entry lines, and yellow and light brown lines are the mids. So for EU, Long: TDI must show green over red, and both lines over TDI mid, then price strikes red line on chart from below. For EU Short: TDI must show red over green, both lines below TDI mid, price strikes red line on chart from above.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
ok, so here is the GU chart made 1/4 regular Happs levels. This chart is the same size as the EU microhapps template. This chart should only be used on the 5 min. Entry rules are the same. Just remember, entry lines for GU are the yellows, and for the EU are the reds. Don't forget to save the TDI indi into your indicators list.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thank you sir i will try it.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I don't know if this thread is still going or not, but I have read it all and can't wait to start to use this. Thank you for all your work. You have given us a tremendous resource. I hope the thread continues to build on your concept. thank you again.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Thanks for posting here E-Money. This thread is open for anybody who wants to talk about Happs. I'm not going to close it, so it will probably be on-again, off-again for some time to come. I think the basic idea and the indicator functionality are strong enough to endure the test of time. Best of Luck-Steve

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi Steve, I like HAPPS a lot. very nice for my swing trading. OB/OS conditions together with MACD/Stocs divergence are a mean combo with support confluences. nice one mate and well done. Gaz

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thanks for saying so Gaz-happy to have another satisfied customer! Yep, MACD/Stocs are good combos with Happs. Also TDI Red Green, posted that one somewhere in here.... Best Regards-Steve

--- 帖子 #164 ---
no probs mate, think you deserve a lot more credit for all this work. as you say, its not a 1 stop shop and does reqire that the user has PA knowledge and some screen time behind them. although i'm a higher tf man these days I do love your micro template also and believe one could grab a guaranteed 10pips a day with it if one wanted to play on the safe side. nice setup on eu this morning. you have trix divergence (cheers cobra for that indy) and stochs (set 5, 5, 5). would have been easy to pull the trigger on that one had I been watching. cheers again!!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Just like that-that's how to trade it. Very nice call and illustration. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #166 ---
nice long setup on GU today on 1hr chart: first off you have a nice uptrend line (in red), then you have an oscillator making new lows whilst PA is making new highs within the uptrendline AND touching touching a red zone of the HAPPS. nice confluence wouldnt you say? clear divergence too. no brainer!! I would have taken this type of setup just based on the TL touch alone together with the divergence however the happs red zone gives extra conviction.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
there is also an exact same type setup on EU 1hr right now - PA is right on the up TL. Divergence on Oscillator (hidden) etc etc. take a look. good for long now id say. stop on real close below TL. cheers

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Gaz- Looks like you called them spot on in both case-EU went straight up and hit the top again! I was sleeping when you made these posts, sorry-that was 6AM here on the East Coast. But yeah, really great analysis and use of confluence. Sticking with the trend, using pullback areas, great stuff! That's really how the indicator is meant to be used, so thanks for giving some good illustrations. In the hands of a capable trader, Happs can be a deadly weapon. Best- Steve

--- 帖子 #169 ---
we had a nice Divergence and subsequent bounce (to the downside) on EU 1hr chart off the 1.45203 S/D line. we've now also broke up trend line on 1hr and had a nice pull back to 1.44477 which also meets with what looks like the new down trend line (nice confluence again.) - I will short on next 1hr closed bar as oscillators are also pointing to downside now in agreement. agressive traders would have got in on TL touch which also met with the 1.44477 fib. good luck. GBP same story. nice initial eu targets are 1.43256 then 1.4276. get out on break of down TL.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
may be worth booking some profits now as first TP reached then move stop to BE as big news at 3pm (GMT) - thats what i've just done ;-) Good luck market talk of stops below yesterdays low of 1.4325

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Good calls. You made some bank on those trades. We got a little retracement off the lower SD pivot back up to the mid. Bear still in play. Technical target for the broken rising wedge is much lower, at 4151. Just a question of where to re-enter the short.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
This is kind of the continuation scenario I'm looking for on EU. The lower green dotted line is the technical target for the wedge.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi Steve, Great thread you have here. I have read it and I appreciate the fact that you are sharring your ideas here. I am using some s/d too in my analysis. I use Sam Seiden's way to look at the s/d zones and this has nothing to do with the historical high or low of a pair, so this is why I studied the eur and it is quite obvious to see that the levels you have marked are mostly also levels that I would have put on my chart (with my normal analysis). So I was just wondering why you decided to name your lines supply and demand lines? Is it because you came too the same conclusion or is it because of something else? Thanks very much again, Mel

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Mel, Thanks for a good question. My original conception of these SD zones, (which are the colored rectangles) are defensive areas placed at ratios of 17-23.6 percent away from each white mid. So they are defensive areas of the thick white mids. The white mids are target areas. They are derived from 50% levels of the historical high and low going a maximum of 4 levels deep. The thin pink mids are the 50% levels that go 5 levels deep. I had to draw a sort of theoretical line-you keep cutting up the chart into smaller 50% levels and some point there is a drop off point where the next level down is going to start falling off in terms of importance. So after some observation I concluded that between levels 4 and 5 is where that drop off point occurs. This is why the thick white mids (levels 1 to 4) have these defensive S/D barriers, and the thin pink mids (level 5) don't. The placement ratio (17-23.6% away from the level 1-4 mids) is just derived from fibonacci studies, seeing that the area of 17 to 23.6% is usually the hardest area of penetration in a given price structure. So I ask myself, where are most of the buyers and sellers likely to be hanging out? I concluded that most of the time they will be 17 to 23.6% away from the level 1-4 mids (thick white lines), because these are the important price levels. (Where 100% is the distance from one white mid to the next). I conceived of these areas in terms of Supply/Demand, because if that's largely where people are loading and unloading-it made more sense to me than S/R. Hope that makes some kind of sense... Thanks, Steve

[quote=stevefx;4882879]Hi Mel, Steve, It makes sence. I understand what your point is. Thanks for the reply. Mel

--- 帖子 #176 ---
morning Steve, yeah its been an ok week....if only they could all be like that lol re reloading the EU short im waiting for pull back to new down trendline then will see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
nice chart mate, think you are on the money with that.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Talk of sell stops through 1.4260 this ties in nicely with HAPPS S/D level of 1.42760

--- 帖子 #179 ---
price pulled back to TL and went through it on 1hr - no position taken as stochs still going up. negative divergence building but will as I say wait for stochs confirmation. 1.44477 could cap this thing yet. will post when position taken and why. Gaz

--- 帖子 #180 ---
is that a head and shoulders I see before me on the 4hr? I'm done for today - nothing grabbed me. nice weekend all!!

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Nice weekend Gaz. Thanks for the calls while I was sleeping- Yeah bulls protecting that lower SD pivot level-I was expecting at least 4241. I didn't have anything in it either way. I can't stay away awake past the first hour of London anymore. Maybe just more ranging in this area for the first part of next week. Or maybe the bear will follow through to some greater extent. We'll see. Price still over support right now so I'm out-

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Steve, sorry for a trivial question and hope you may be able to clear up my blind spot. I read your notes many times over how the levels are calculated by sub-dividing 50% levels from 1st level down to 4th. That seem clear enough. In that case I expect levels ploted on the charts to be equi-distant (between the Green and Red bands), but this is not so.. why is that? Did I miss out something. I have a few points still a little fuzzy about, best I pose one a time. Thank you for your patience in reply.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes you missed something, but that's OK. I did kind of explain this in post 174, and also in the .txt document on the first page. I'll go through it one more time. Basically you have 3 kinds of lines on the chart: The thick white mids, the thin pink mids, and the colored rectangles. If you look at the thin pink mids and the thick white mids, you will see that they are all equidistant from one another. Those are all the 50% levels. The only difference between between the thick white mids and the thin pink mids is that the thin pink mids are the last derived mids in the chain. Thin pink mids = level 5 derivation. Thick white mids = levels 1-4 derivation. Therefore in theory the thick white mids are more important than the thin pink mids. Say for example you were to keep placing 50% levels on the chart until you placed them 16 levels deep, and there was only 3 points between every level. You wouldn't give the same level of importance to some run of the mill 12th level line as you would to a level 2 or 3 line. This seems obvious. So at some point theoretically the levels get a lot less psychological consideration the deeper you go. After placing the lines, and studying the charts I decided that that dropping off point should be between levels 1-4 (thick white mids) and levels 5 (thin pink mids). Here is where the colored rectangles come in: these colored rectangles and the lines at the middle of them are not derived from 50% levels of the historical high, low, and median price. Instead they are placed at ratios of 17-23.6% away from each level 1-4 line (thick white mid) (where 100% is the distance from one thick white mid to the next one). You can see post 174 to see why I chose to place them at those ratios away from the level 1-4 lines. So level 1-4 lines (thick white mids) are getting these fibonnaci derived barrier areas (colored rectangles, or SD Pivot Zones), and level 5 lines (thin pink mids) are not. This is what creates the staggered effect that you are speaking of. This is why the Happs phases are of two different sizes. However, if you look at the chart closely, you will see that all the 50% lines, the thick white and thin pink lines are indeed equidistant. -

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Here's a little more visual explanation. Should be 2,000 words worth.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Now if you look at the same picture with the Draw Fibs option activated, you can see that the indicator picks up nearly every single turning point.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thank you so much Steve for your kind explanation and illustrations. Everything is crystal now.. I could make good sense of what you have wriiten now. My blind spot was mistaking the Pivot Zones as the 1st to 4th rank 50% lines. Thanks once again. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
No problemo-use it in good health! Cheers-Steve

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Is it possible to have the indicator in the .mq4 format, please ?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
so tired!! went to music fest at the weekend.....the coffee isnt even helping! still waiting for something to grab me on EU - no trade as yet. although stochs are OS on the 1hr chart just as price is touching down trend line so there could be a good short opp cooking here. will watch and run with it on confirmation - will post if I get it. oh and there is a hidden negative divergence on the 4hr chart too. nice.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
hi guys, just waiting for stochs to confrim before pulling the short trigger. first TP 1.43256, 2nd 1.4276. cheers and good luck

--- 帖子 #191 ---
STM = short that motha!!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Not unless you know how to convert ex4 to mq4. Pat Patel coded the indicator, I just designed its brain. Don't ask me about advanced techy stuff, dunno....

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Good stuff MrTrendy. Looks like you nailed that one nearly to the pip. I swear you make your first post the minute I shut my eyes. I caught some pips going north and called it a night. Good trades this week!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
morning mate!! made no coin on that trade lol. just logged in and have found that my BE stop was taken out. was hoping to make that first TP at least. strong news out of China I think. lets try to get that coin today!! cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hey Gaz, Sucks, you went for a bit too much. Know the feeling! Just made +50 EU longs, pretty easy stuff. Good news is its pushing some tough levels, lets see if shorts set up nice.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Got some reference points for this upper SD pivot level. Gotta give price a chance to do what its gonna do off this bull.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
well done mate. yeah greed in my case was NOT good lol loving this swinging market though!!

--- 帖子 #198 ---
yeah 1.452 looks the target doesnt it!! stochs starting to enter OB already so 452 could be a stumbling point but as you say, will let PA do its thing. get the coffee on mate. Gaz

--- 帖子 #199 ---
another point worth mentioning, when I took that short yesterday I did feel uneasy. dont get me wrong, it was the right trade at the time but i'm always loathed to put new stuff on late in the London session. my fav time and most productive is between say 8:30 and lunchtime in London as I get the best moves what with this period being the most liquid and before all the london fx guys go out on the beer for lunch and prob dont come back!

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I hear you. Right before NY consolidation and you don't know what you're going to end up with.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I'm kind of hesitant here. Not that I'm going to do anything until PA supports it. But on the one hand there some bearish confluence at the upper SD pivot level, and on the other its a possible break point for the massive cup and handle pattern on the H4. So I'm going to sit back a bit and see how it plays before deciding on any trades.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
now i'm really annoyed with myself. didnt spot this one. drew new TL on 4hr as it seems the break down of the prev one has been short lived and we get this on the 1hr chart....stochs making lows whilst PA making highs around SD zones right at a TL too....took my finger off the pulse. I dnd't stand back and re-evaluate enough after the weekend. had it too easy last week I think and the market needed to remind us of some stuff ;-)

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Good chart. Don't worry you'll get em back. Anyway my outlook right now: We got some stopping volume on the long bar, and there's bearish confluence at the top. That could play out as the chart indicates. But I'm just keeping an eye on the red TL, or any close over that SD zone, and the sky's the limit. See how it goes. I'm slightly favoring the bearish outcome but sitting tight.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
i'm with you mate. bearish divergence building on the 4hr oscillators.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
been a nice bearish divergence on GU 1hr followed by stochs confirm for new short.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
That's a good bit of confluence on GU. Hard rejection off the TL helps. I'm just waiting for EU to crack this support level before shorting any dollar pairs.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
GU, looks promising.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
agreed, should move quite quick too.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
will take partial profits @ 1.64852 ish and move stop to BE. 2nd TP is green s/d area in the 1.64142 region. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Shorted EU at 61, level cracked.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Good job buddy. I'm not looking for too much on the EU. 4422 or so.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
yeah i'm out of EU today - just not grabbing me. GU had blatent divergence at the S/D level then the stochs confirmed so I was like fill my boots!! if I have to squint at the screen I wont take it. good luck with the short mate. eu is deff looking on the heavy side - cracking that level!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Lol, yes that's usually my motto also-no squinting. Anyway I just grabbed the easy 20 pips and called it a day. +70. Works for me. Had to work for it though. See you next time.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
great stuff!! you must be so tired about now lol. hit that sack and cuddle up to those 70pips!!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Will dooo. I am tired. Here are the trades.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Steve, Nice thread, easy to follow system and directions in your text. Easy to see why you have the rating you have. This sure makes it easy to figure out where to place your stops and take profit! Will try to post trades as they happen. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Thanks for the good words Mike. The more the merrier-looking forward to seeing your trades and ideas. -Steve

--- 帖子 #218 ---
new recruits, I like it!! sry I aint been around today, had a few jobs to do. anyways!! EU looks V interesting. I have placed a sell limit 1.45131 (just below red S/D zone) as there is a divergence building and EU looks OB in the short term and is due a little pull back. we shall see. I wont hesitate in getting out if she runs against me!! first TP 1.44472 - 2nd is 1.43744. hopefully I will get a fill. made out on the first tp of my GU yesterday but hit on my BE stop on the pull back which is annoying seeing as it would have hit the 2nd tp today. still, i'm glad that I am strict as if I dont apply a BE after first tp is hit the Pa would deff run against me and take back what it gave!! tomorrow i am going to go into a little more detail on how I take my trades. hopefully some newbies will find it useful. all the best Gaz ps, re the EU short limit order I have set, although I have set reasonable PA targets, going by the way she is setting up I believe she could make a run for 1.43256 &amp; 1.42760 also and maybe quite quickly. as usual though you should let PA and indys confirm. we're not in the business of making crystal ball calls after all!!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Steve, I like running your TDI indy on the higher TF's alongside my stochs setup to identify nice swing trades/formations coupled with OB/OS setups in line with the S/D zones. nice one. Gaz

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hey Gaz, Sorry your posts came through when I was sleeping again. Didn't get your fill on the EU. Actually that was my target for the high of the day, a little surprised it didn't hit it. I just traded some scalps early on for 25 pips and called it a night. Anyway multiple misses up top for EU, I guess we could see some lower numbers soon. Still gotta break this lower zone though. GU, stingy b-stard, finally broke hard. That's forex. Sounds like a great idea to show your trading process in a greater detail. I'm sure there are many folks who will appreciate it-including me. Best-Steve

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hey Gaz, I am looking forward to learning from you guys. Just a question I have just been trading the one hour time frame only. Sounds like from the previous few posts that the larger time frames work as well. I prefer the 4Hr and Daily. Thanks Mike

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hey guys, Looks like the GBP looking good for a buy. I will be looking for an entry soon, at the 50% fib line. Mike

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I don't happen to trade off the Daily charts directly Mike, but I do reference them from time to time, when I feel like I want to get a better sense of the long term picture. You know its all tradeable though. You just need some reference points, TL's, indicator agreements, fib confluences, patterns, or other reasons to take the trade. That holds true for pretty much any TF. 4hr TF is also good many times for finding indicator divergence. Babypips.com gives a good explanation of the different kinds of divergence that there are if you're not familiar with that. -Steve

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I'm not sure which line you mean {Edit: I got you, 50% fib of the upmove since the low of AUG 11}. If you mean the white mid pivot, that might work out for you. Murrey Math has it main 4/8's SR line right below that point and its bottoming out on the 15 Min. I just don't usually like to be the guy thats trying to grab the first pip in a new upmove, or downmove for that matter. You want to make sure that its really bottomed out before getting in on it. One way I do that is to use supertrend support levels to make sure that its broken in my favor on at least the 15 min TF. Or for long trends a break on the 30 min ST line is even better. But yeah that level is definitely worth a look.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Here's some regular bullish divergence for you on the 30 min GU chart. Price is making lower lows while the oscillator is making higher lows.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
STEVO!! morning mate!! may get the EU fill yet! was hoping to wake up to a nice fat fill!! lol yeah i'm deffo going to post some more stuff in due course on my FX thoughts etc like i said on my pm to you before, I have found your HAPPS indy has brought on my trading so I wanted to put something back in the thread. your're tech knowledge far outweighs mine. anyway its just nice to have some decent company will take a look at GU in a sec. just logged into MT4. Gazza

--- 帖子 #227 ---
nice call mate. I was looking at that yesterday before packing up also. PA O/S, TDI extreame (in short term) OS also. good eyes.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hey Gazz sounds good buddy. Not much trading today but a little frustration trying to scalp AU for -9. Mostly I'm in mad scientist mode playing with charts. Looks like another reject up top for EU so don't know about that fill. We shall see. Look forward to the charts. Going to Starbucks to juice up. Catch you later-Steve

--- 帖子 #229 ---
lol I get the mad scientist days too - think its when my usual setups aren't showing up and I need something to do....enter the 5min chart of doom hahaha Just done my first coffee. teeing up th next

--- 帖子 #230 ---
meanpips, getting pull back on your gu long call. with positive divergence buliding but not confirmed as yet. one to watch....

--- 帖子 #231 ---
you coffeed up now mate?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Lol, yeah I'm good and juiced now. The noose tightens on EU, getting interesting. Any trades on the menu?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
still watching gu with interest. positive divergence pretty much confirmed however I like the stochs to turn up and cross, then get a 1hr closed bar. I often leave pips on the table like this (like the GU trade yesterday) however at least I can be sure i'm in the right direction (hopefully!!).... you? Gaz

--- 帖子 #234 ---
No, I think I'm going to spectate for the rest of the day. I'm working out some new methods. I don't blame you for waiting for some real solid confirmation on GU. All the the USD pairs are very iffy right now IMHO, but right now GU is the most bearish of them all. If you look at the initial down 1hr bar off the top-its a big bar. Then the sucker bull rally before the big drop. Just signs of potential heavy movement down. Still, good pins of the mid pivot, maybe accumulation happening here. Could happen. Better to stick with your confirmation than to gamble, as you say.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
yeah i'm out for now....you dont have to trade every day after all. Still think EU will see 1.452 again before next dump. feels like a Fri today - had a few beers last night for a friends going away party. early night for me....after some Black Ops action that is (my missus hates it lol) Gaz

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Sweet. You mean COD? And yep, EU could do it. I'd love it. Its a sell I'd want to take. Its got some tough support to break before making any new lows, that's for sure.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
yeah COD, havent had it long so still getting creamed but getting better. need a mouse like the good ol days on my pc playing counterstrike and Rainbow6 (the first one).... Gaz

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Man I played both of those. Counterstrike multiplayer owned. Rainbow six too when you could still plot out the missions, and before it began to suck in the later games.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
yeah counterstrike Multi was BADASS hahaha 56k modem sucked tho

--- 帖子 #240 ---
56k lag Funny. OK, thread officially derailed.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
at least we dont have to trade with a 56k modem!!

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Truly, might as well give your money away to the poor than do that. Anyway GU slipping, I got two potential down targets, 6231 and 6184, if it keeps slipping.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
yep, its just appraoching first SD zone now. could hold here seeing as there is also divergence building still.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
not getting the easy opportunities today are we!!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Well it did get a good bounce when it first hit on the 15 min. But I wouldn't get in front of GU right now with several elephants. The best opportunity at the moment is to sell small retraces if you can find a good entry.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
yeah deffo, will wait for pull back to TL which will hopefully give some nice confluence at the same time. both eu and gu look heavy though.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
EU....a pic says a thousand words. well didnt pay attention to this. so there WAS in fact an easy opp. i was just asleep lol 3 taps and its OUT!! for those who are breakout traders you could short on the close of the current 1hr bar which is breaking a nice long uptrend line

--- 帖子 #248 ---
i've shorted the breakout - target 1.4276 - got in @ 1.43527

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Well I joined you at 4376. My target is 4278, with about a 48 point SL.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
nice one mate, I reckon it may take til tom to get there (but you never know) but we will get there!! I shorted as soon as 1hr bar clsed - sometimes it carries on running and other times you get the pull back. nice entry mate.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thanks Gazz. I'll guess we'll see soon enough. Gonna catch a few Zzz's. Hopefully when I wake up we'll both be in the green! Good chatting buddy. Catch you next time. Tomorrow might suck after this crazy Thursday... -Laters

--- 帖子 #252 ---
we'll be fine mate trust me!! have a good one, good chatting. Gaz

--- 帖子 #253 ---
morning mate, just logged in to find i'm 80pips down so far....nice!! lol was about to close but notice that we have a potential short cooking. pa right at down TL and 1.44477 which is mid level SO i'll wait for a sec and may add second short. also divergence on stoch. if PA closes above down TL i'm out. you in still Steve? Gaz

--- 帖子 #254 ---
watching waiting

--- 帖子 #255 ---
hit COD hard last night lol hours pass like minutes on that bloody game!!

--- 帖子 #256 ---
GU is lining up to be a cracking short by the looks of things....will post if/when I short.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hey Gaz, Sorry been watching the charts. No I closed that EU trade manually when I saw its continued momentum over the SD zone. EU can still go either way right now. I'm watching it try and fail to close over 4436.5 on the 15 min chart 7 times in a row. You'd think the bulls would have given it up.... But still watching and waiting for a rejection or bull at this level. We'll see. More COD huh?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
GU yeah, I'm thinking at the white mid pivot or just a tick below there, shorties to be in play.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
yep more COD. the missus is wishing she never got me the ps3 now hahaha what did she expect!!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
once both my stochs are in line and have crossed i'll be in the short trade like a rat up a drainpipe!!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Ok sounds good! Let us know...

hows micro happs going for you mate?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I haven't traded it lately, thanks for asking though. I've had my nose buried in some other stuff. Maybe at some point I'll come out with it, but right now its kind of developmental. I do hope those charts get used though. I particularly like the half size GU chart. It lines up with price really well.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
almost there, almost there! if my stochs cross and point down before current 1hr close bar then I will add to existing short. I think Jackson Hole will not match up to expectations and we will see BIG $ rally. talking about EU btw re extra short to add. still watching GU with interest though. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #265 ---
stating to turn but no cigar yet. need that 'proper' cross followed by 1hr close.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I just wanted to point out this bullish confluence area as price starts to move down. I've been using this fib fan from the low established on the 19th to the various peeks, and it gives some good information. In this case you can see the rising support line along the top fan line. This falls into confluence with the green SD zone, and 1 hr supertrend line which has opened up bullish right in the same place. So this is going to be down around 4382, just an area to watch.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
thoughts on Jack Hole today guys? hard to see congress allowing any big QE3 plans while the dow is above 10k?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
cheers Steve

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Awesome work on this thread Steve. Will definitively look closely how things are doing on charts. Keep up the good job. FerruFx

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hey thanks very much indeed Ferru! Your input is certainly welcome here anytime. -Steve

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I wish I could give you an intelligent answer on that one. The news just confuses me.... I do know what the QUE3 is, and I guess you're saying that its unlikely that Ben or the powers that be would print more dollars if the economy seems well enough along. Most of the gossip I've heard about it seems pessimistic as well. How this would effect this price of EU or other currencies is another question. I'm guessing flight to the dollar type thing?

--- 帖子 #272 ---
agreed, I think the $ could rally today and Gold will pull back until which time in the near future they will announce QE3 for real and it will go 2000+

--- 帖子 #273 ---
You're most than welcome! FerruFx

shorted GU @ 1.63142 on 1hr close as stochs finally cross down. havent touched eu as they didnt look properly crossed and now its gone down too quick Gaz wrong chart!!

Gaz

It was man, but you got out of it. Good weekend. Thanks for the info on CHF.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Dear Steve, Can you please provide Happs template for Gold and Silver.... Its really usefull and dot on when it comes to forex ... Need to see for metals ... Thanks a lot in advance .... Regards, Ganesh

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi Steve, How do you calculate the Intraday Happs zones? Pat

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Sorry but gold and silver are not available on my IBFX charts. Its pretty easy to make a template if you have the charts available to you. 1) Mark the historical high and low of the metal with two horizontal trendlines. 2) Apply the Happs indicator to chart. 3) right click the chart, open your inidicators list 4) open the Happs indicator 5) input the high and low of the metal into the indicator 6) choose the draw fibs option if you want the fibs to show up 7) change the background of your chart to steel blue for best visibility That's pretty much it-then save it as a template GL-Steve

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hi Pat, I think you are referring to the micro happs charts? I did those all manually. Essentially I made the charts with levels 1/4 the size of the regular Happs levels. I also made the the one GU chart 1/2 the size which works out kind of nicely on the 15 min chart. Pretty easy, to get half the size just go 6 levels deep with the 50% levels instead of 5. To get 1/4 size, which are 5 minute charts, go 7 seven levels deep. If you go 6 levels deep, then levels 1-5 show up as the key levels (thick white mid), and level 6 shows up as the less important alternate (thin pink mid) If you go 7 levels deep, then levels 1-6 show up as the key levels (thick white mids) and level 7 shows up as the less important alternate (thin pink mid). So then where the colored rectangles are on the regular Happs charts I just placed a single H line. To determine the placement for those lines just depends on how many levels you add on the chart. If you are adding 7 levels then placement is 20.3% above and below each level 1-6 line, where 100% is equal to the distance from one 1-6 level line to the next. Obviously, if you are adding only 6 levels to get half size charts, then the placement is 20.3% above and below each level 1-5 line, where 100% is the distance from one level 1-5 line to the next. That's pretty much it. Thanks-Steve

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Dear Steve, Thanks a lot for the explanation..... IBFX has introduced Gold and silver trading .... I mean IBFX Australia ... Thanks ... Ganesh

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Steve-OOOOOO!!!!! morning mate and all. so your house didnt end up on the other side of the rainbow then (re Hur Irene)....!! had great weekend with the family, now looking forward to the EU tug of war this week!! lol Gaz

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hey Gaz, Nah, live on the west coast of Florida, didn't even get close. Was just a bit propped up in the news-never know with that kind of stuff though. Yeah, EU. Was focused more on the CHF pairs earlier and managed to pull 71 pips out of those short moves. As far as EU, think its getting into buying range. I see the potential down to lower SD zone 4375. Having broken new highs you'd expect the bull to be lying in wait somewhere between where it is now and there. Summer is closing and the big shot traders are getting back to their offices from the beach homes in the Hamptons, so we can see a break of this range and some movement soon, me thinks.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Nice one mate re the CHF pips. reckon you are right re EU - looking like Bullish Divergence is building. watching - waiting. GL this week mate. Gaz

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Thanks for the chart. Your the king of stochs brother. Time to get all Rambo this week-think Black Ops GL to you too-

--- 帖子 #296 ---
interesting... http://www.zerohedge.com/news/how-ec...m-payroll-numb Gaz

--- 帖子 #297 ---
lol dude, I lost 3hours on that damn game the other night - had to get a hold of myself and turn it off before I ended up pulling an all nighter!!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Wow good report, that last chart is a little spooky..

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Anyway, the box shows bullish confluence. You have the Daily TL aligned with SD zone, and also the lowest retracement level of the fib fan from the low on the 19th to the recent high.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
yep, that looks the potential place to lock and load the longs!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Attached a small tool i've coded for an easier use of the Happs_Phases v4. There was 2 things which are a bit boring : define the historical high and low of the monthly chart, and the colored zone not update in real time. So as I didn't have the mq4 to modify directly the Happs_Phases_v4, I did a small tool : 1. When applied, you can now find in the top left corner the historical values of the High and Low of the Monthly chart. Once you set these values in the Happs_Phases_v4 indicator, you can disable the display. 2. The tool update automatically the colored zones plotted by the Happs_Phases_v4 indicator. They are now longer and go past the current time. Hope that will help ... FerruFx

--- 帖子 #302 ---
nice one mate! works like a charm!!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Excellent Ferru! Thanks a lot my friend. I'll add this to this front page. This definitely cuts down on the annoyance factors. (just tried it out, it works perfectly, really cool. I'm going to redo the templates with the indi included as well) -thanks again, Steve

--- 帖子 #304 ---
You're most than welcome. Steve, you gave more than what we all can give back. FerruFx

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Well Cheers Ferru, my aim has just been to find a way to help myself and others succeed a bit easier at this tough game, and make some good pips for ourselves and families, and its certainly nice to be appreciated. But without great coders like yourself and Pat, I'd still be making slightly inaccurate Happs charts by hand. So thanks again. -Steve

--- 帖子 #306 ---
What do you think Gaz? We're getting some pretty good reaction off the SD zone. Possible for another dip. Waiting on your stochs to line up?

--- 帖子 #307 ---
GU also looking interesting. bullish divergence right at SD zone - stochs have not as yet confirmed but this is one to watch. would have been great if this played out during London prime time liquidity. coming into lunch time UK now so to be honest i'll probably spectate today but we'll see. Gaz

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Got you. Thanks for the GU chart. It is nice. Will be watching.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
yeah mate waiting for stochs to line up. hopefully sooner rater then later as i'm going to stop putting on late afternoon London time trades as signals are often more dodgy in my experiance. still waiting.... trading can be boring lol Gaz

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Somebody said good trading should be boring, I think. Considering that it seems like I should have a better ROI We should crack out the paint drying videos on Youtube.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
GU blown through SD zone - this is why I always wait for stochs to make their divergence then cross up/down to confirm....stops me catching that falling knife! newbies, just because PA is oversold doesnt mean you should buy/sell with it. it could stay that way for xxx pips. wait for PA and indys to say hey i'm blatently turning you fool!! then pull trigger. Gaz

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Absolutely buddy. Couldn't agree more. Wait for your technical confirm and pull the trigger as per. That is one major difference between new traders and experienced traders. Another is that when a big trend is underway, experienced traders will look for a way to get in on it, while new traders for some reason always want to counter trade. When a pair is ranging, looking for turning points and waiting for techs to confirm is the way to go. When trending, its looking for retracements (and re-entries with the main trend).

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Agreed. I used to want to counter ALL the time. newbie mistake. although if you are experianced you would have took the short this morning on EU or GU (London Time) as you had negative divergence on the 1hr at SD zone, then stochs cross down to confirm at time of the best liquidity so although you are against the main trend, this would have been fine to take. if I was up early enough I would have pulled the trigger on that one. now i'm just waiting for decent signal to go long with trend again. Newbie tip, go up to 4hr chart and see if you can draw a trend line (free hand) that goes up to current price bar. if you find something that resembles a good TL (trend Line) with more then 2 touches, go down to the 1hr and see if you can get any entries on pull backs to TL - make sure that there is something more to go with the pull back - for instance divergence on an oscillator. if you get a pull back to TL, and confluence withe an indicator such as macd/stochs etc and it is also at an important resistance/supprot level (like on the happs indi - SD zones)_ then pull that trigger and pull it hard!! you could use the TL as your stop loss ie if PA on the 1hr closes below that you get our. take profits at maybe 20pips for half then go for 50 with remaining OR go for next SD or Mid point. loads of possibilities. anyway i've posted some charts prev with good examples of what I mean. there will be a day(s) when you see no setup but if you stay true to an approach like the above you will be well in the game and make some decent coin. obviously this is only 1 way to trade and is one of the ways I do it - there are many other short and long term ways which may suit. better to experiment with micro account to get the hang of it. stay away from demo. learning curve much slow with demo imo. also there will be days when you 'dont feel quite right' - I dont mean sick, I mean thatyou just dont feel in sync with the charts. dont fight that feeling, instead use it as a reason go get out of the house to do what ever you like to do with your free time. do not put trades on unless the chart grabs you and says OPPORTUNITY HERE!!!! the best trades are obvious ones. you will of course put bad ones one (you're not a machine after all - Arnie aside) but dont beat yourself up about that for as long as you follow the plan you'll be ok because you know what a profitable trade looks like and you can also recognise when you are being stupid and get the hell out of any crappy trade you've done. cheers for reading. Gaz

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Excellent stuff Gaz! -Cheers

--- 帖子 #316 ---
cheers mate, just updated as I made loads of typos!! lol cheers tho

--- 帖子 #317 ---
EU hidden divergence getting BIG now although not confirmed. this has potential to explode upwards soon. maybe within NY, ASIA then back to London (3 sessions).... we'll see - still waiting watching and getting bored....

--- 帖子 #318 ---
It's also close to setting off one of my trigger templates, like a hair away. Try this bad boy if you want. Its not something I use to scout positions, but it is something I use to trigger positions that I've already scouted out. 15 min chart. Cross on the RSI-EMA (will give an arrow) + break and close on the supertrend 15 min level is trigger. (assuming entry level has already been evaluated) 90 or better on the CCI is also a good sign, but not required

--- 帖子 #319 ---
as Borat would say......I Liiiiiiiike!!!! nice one mate. picked this mornings dump pretty damn well

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Lol, cool man, glad you like it. (Just for new traders to keep in mind)-its not an auto take every signal template. Its a threshold template to trigger positions that you've already looked at and deemed worthy at a shot for entry based on at least some other criteria.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
long EU @ 44154 - stochs crossed and pointing up.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
will get out if stochs dont agree anymore and TP at Mid level 1.44477 (then move stop to BE) then 1.5203 ish for second TP. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #323 ---
this is the main Oscillator I use on 1hr for finding divergence and confirmation of fast/short line cross (it has alert function built in). Cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I think its going to happen, but the Dow is down a bit this morning. Otherwise this thing would already be skyrocketing. Trapped under the weekly pivot for the time being. (thanks for posting your indi-will check it out)

--- 帖子 #325 ---
have put on a BE stop now as trade has been 20 or more pips in profit. the best trades dont look back anyway so if my break even stop gets taken out this will probably go back down to SD zone and potentially give a better entry chance. but so far soo good. dont like first day back after bank holiday so hence the caution. Gaz

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Well Sinister just triggered so I'm joining you long for a spell.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
GU looking like its finally finding its bottom too so thats a positive. Gaz

--- 帖子 #328 ---
booked profits at the mid. hopefully we'll get up to the next S/D zone now - move stops to BE for those that havent done so already. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Just to shoot the breeze- I have a new stock trading strategy-I mean this is real weekend warrior stuff, since I know jack about trading stocks. But my demo portfolio is up 2.7% since opening it on Sunday. Basically, my strategy is to buy either tech stocks that I know a little about (5 year or older companies) or too big to fail stocks that are priced somewhere around where they were after the market crashed in 2008. So I bought Bank of A, Nvidia, AMD, Cisco, Intel, and this real dog Avid (msn has it on their sell list). Everything is up, even after today so far. I'll let you know...:nerd:

--- 帖子 #330 ---
lol I got creamed many moons ago with the old stocks. though to be fair I didnt know jack about TA then so maybe one day i'll re-vist though I feel that manipulation happens on a massive scale in the stock market. FX is that much harder to manipulate due to the size (during the liquid sessions that is) thats why I prefer it. will be interested to hear how you get on tho mate.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Me too- Warren Buffet invested 5 billion into Bank of A, I know its not going out of business, and its near its 3 year low. Its been up near 60 and I bought it for less than 8. That's about the whole extent of my rationality. AMD, I like this one because they got their ass handed to them by Intel for last few years, but now they have this new APU (CPU + Graphics card on one chip) technology on the market which I think is really promising and could be sort of revolutionary in the CPU market if they make it a little more powerful. Aside from that the price was right. Its just demo for fun, thats why I'm winning.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
yeah I guess Warren must know something to put that kind of coin into BofA. I tell you though mate, he is a braver man then I!!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
i'm off mate, got my remaining trade open still with stop set at BE and TP @ 1.4520. GL and cu tom!! cheers guys.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Take care man, see you then.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
morning guys. let me start off by saying that I hate month end trading sessions as much as I hate the day back after a bank holiday....had to get that off my chest. anyway, market whisper is that todays ME flows could be $ positive. not expecting to much today. didnt get the quick swing up in the end did we (yesterday). made out nicely on first TP then PA took out my BE stop. anyway i'm happy to have got something considering I missed the morning bear run!! maybe I should start getting up earlier!! Good luck all! Gaz

--- 帖子 #336 ---
$CHF catching the eye as potential long candidate. keeping eye on it. Oscillators brewing some divergence (unconfirmed).

--- 帖子 #337 ---
whisper re $JPY - apparently there are large bids in the 76.50 area (right at a HAPPS S/D zone......just saying

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Steve, it is just one week that I am reading your forum on HAPPS Trading System and something it is not clear to me. I would appreaciate a lot if you could help me in the questions below: -which is the difference between Phase1-and Phase 2 in terms of trading opportunity. It is clear how those are build but I do not know if those can give a different piece of information. -as entry setup you consider just the SD pivot zone ? -white/pink mid line are used just as Target/stop zone? Thanks, Teo

--- 帖子 #339 ---
.80492 could be a nice potential entry on $CHF - right on SD zone with positive divergence cooking away - if oscillators confirm it later then pull trigger!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #340 ---
short GU @ 62866

--- 帖子 #341 ---
there was bounce off SD zone @ 63255 with stochs divergence (stochs made new high whilst PA didnt then they crossed to downside and we just had the 1hr closed bar confirming that. first target Mid zone @ 62544 then 2nd target next SD zone @ 61347. will stop out manually if my stochs start changing their mind. or PA looks like blowing through 63255 SD zone above. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hey Gaz, Morning. I've also been watching GC. Staked out some potential long levels. 3197 and 3110. Will be watching today. EU is stuck in the mud with mixed techs. But the lower TL is still untested and the lower SD zone is still a potential buy area.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
morning mate, yeah agree re EU - didnt grab me at all this morning....

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Nice one on the short. Big diamond on GU right now on the H1 H4. The bottom of the diamond is just below the mid at around 6233. Gotta watch the bull there.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
comment out of another news site re GBP.... Recent comments from BOE’s Posen (QE2) and the BIS (UK debt concerns) seems to have left a nasty taste with traders with the quid slipping down towards apparently good bids towards 1.6250. There are large stops below here which could see a further drop to 1.6205/10. Guess we’ll just have to wait and see but have a sneeking suspicion there’s bad data out later from the US, which may prompt further QE3 banter and weaken the dollar again.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
cheers for heads up mate. will split position at the mid and as usual apply BE stop. if stops trigger below 6250 we may get a run to green SD zone....who knows!! ;-)

how do you see CHF Stevo? Gaz

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I've been watching EC and GC pretty closely-they're all moving together pretty closely though. EC and GC both hit my projected downtargets for bullish resumption. But as yet I haven't seen enough of the bull to place a trade. All still under 15 min supertrend lines. So watching and waiting just like you, and for the same reasons. NY consolidation right now, will bore the tears out of you. See how it looks about 8:30 EST, quarter to 9.

$CHF blown down through SD @ .80492 - Stochs pointing south so still no sign of any turn in the breeze! still obvious positive divergence in place. wait wait wait!! Gaz

just booked some profits....30pips hard to pass up on a month end day!! mid within reach!! keep on truckin

--- 帖子 #367 ---
newbie tip - the most important thing in this game is to try and grind out profits on a daily baisis. dont be afraid to take 20-30 pips here and there. you cant got broke taking a profit as they say. you will get your home runs (only last week I took well over 100 pips on a trade as posted here) but its your little and often winners that keep you alive. the big ones will pay for the few small losers you may get. home runs = ememy and little and often profits = Friend.... dont get me wrong, there are big hitters on FF but they have a lot more skill then you and I - I hope to me like them one day but for now I will take my pips when I can get em!! cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #368 ---
$JPY powering up - and EU sliding. I think this $CHF trade has every chance of hitting the Mid pivot @ 81205 hope some of you got in on it. cheers again HAPPS but mostly Steve. Gaz

--- 帖子 #369 ---
GL on that one Gaz. I think I've seen enough CHF shennanigans for one day. Its going to be hard to reverse that daily bearish bar past any strong resistance point. If GC can close on the hour above 3201 then can happen. Thats it for me today though. I'll see you guys next time.

morning all. nice moves this a.m I see!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
so, EU downtrend on attached 1hr chart - look to enter short on pullbacks to the down trend line i've drawn (if indis also support)....

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Morning Gaz. Yeah, and GU broke the bottom of the diamond. Retesting level now. Gotta get some coffee. See you in a bit.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
good idea re the coffee.... its Indy play time....

--- 帖子 #377 ---
My system doesn't like that one. It made it freeze. Had to delete the indicator to get it unfrozen. (No big deal though.) I think I have an older MT4 build and sometimes it acts funny with certain indis.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
One of the posters in the GU thread remarked that the diamond on the GU isn't valid because the lower TL only got two touches. And its just expanding its lower line instead of actually "breaking". I suppose this is possible. However he is long to the hilt on it so maybe its just wishful thinking. I suppose only a break of the lowest point (diamond bottom) would disprove his theory.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Newbies, this is what I was talking about re drawing a TL on a 4hr....as you can see there was nice opportunities to re-enter longs....anyway EU (per chart) has broken uptrend so look to short pull backs.... Gaz

more order flow re EU this time BIS was seen buying below 1.4310 (nice job), but we eventually saw stops through 1.4300 give out on our way to session low 1.4261.

Back. Yes price at some critical levels on a number of pairs. GC for one. It has slightly pierced its interim support level. Now teetering. That could go another leg down, possibly a full phase sell off. Its on the brink so just watching.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Here's a chart for GC.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
nice confluence mate.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thanks buddy. Got to see though. I'm not a genius so its hard to sell at 0/8th's Murrey Math level without some pretty good confirmation.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
more EU whispers Good support is seen in the 1.4260 area but stops are gathering below that level, it should be no surprise. Our Asian central bank friends have been buyers ahead of that level, rumor has it… Talk of US central bank sales in the 1.4280s persists. EUR/USD stops down through 1.4250/60, bids below towards 1.4220. Offers above at 1.4320 with more around 1.4350 and stops up through 1.4360 EUR/GBP sell stops down through 0.8790/95

EU stops taken out - 4276 SD zone blown through....looks like the mid is a gimme at the moment. still waiting for the dust to settle on the 4hr TL break on EU - wanna see a pull back for more short opps. im out today. Gaz

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Well I took a 25 point short trade on GU to the good. Then when I checked EU hit 4228. Close below that on the 15min I expect some continuation. Otherwise retrace to 4258, then possibly 4299.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Don't blame you. EU is tough trading right now.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
this vol is crazy! well done! on the gu short m8 - glad someone is getting some today

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Thanks buddy. I just saw the bar take off and figured the mid where the previous low is, is the likely target. I know EU though, its all highly technical trading and it can be a nightmare on these kinds of days unless you really study the levels before hand. I generally stay away from it unless I got a lot of homework done or can spot something very obvious.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Newbs, yet another example of the power of the pull back trade when going with the trend. clear down TL on the 4hr GU chart here. look at the pull back on the 29th @ 14:00 (UK time). PA kissed the TL and there was a perfect divergence on the stochs. note HAPPS SD level at 64226....nice confluence.... Gaz

--- 帖子 #402 ---
this is what i'm waiting for EU to do btw after its initial break of up TL. cheers

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Excellent example bro, cheers. I do expect to see some more selling going on here. My own down targets at this point for EU are 4206 and 4169.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Anyway I'm checking out for today, or at least a while. Need to eat. Will check in later to see how its going. GL all.

Straight from the horse's mouth, in this case Goldman, which agrees with Zero Hedge that the ISM was weaker than perceived below the surface, and also provides an NFP goose egg for tomorrow: "ISM stronger than expected in August, although details of the report are softer than the headline suggests... We are lowering our forecast for tomorrow's nonfarm payroll report to +25k, from +50k previously. The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak hiring in late July and August: a sharp deterioration in perceptions of job availability in the latest Conference Board survey, a drop in today's ISM manufacturing employment index, another drop in job advertising, and a soft ADP report. Layoffs seem to have remained low, given steady jobless claims in the 410,000 range, although even here the recent pickup in layoff announcements is a concern. " As everyone knows all too well, the difference of 25K people when you are dealing with a sample of over 100 million has just one name: policy. Full report: SM Better Than Expected; Cutting our Payroll Forecast BOTTOM LINE: ISM stronger than expected in August, although details of the report are softer than the headline suggests. Construction spending report also solid after revisions. However, we are cutting our forecast for nonfarm payroll employment to +25k from +50k due to signs of weak hiring in late July and August. US-MAP: ISM 5 (5, +1) Construction spending 0 (1, 0) with 4 point upward adjustment due to positive revisions KEY NUMBERS: ISM index 50.6 in August vs. GS 48.5, median forecast 48.5. Construction spending -1.3% (mom) in July vs. GS +0.5%, median forecast +0.2%. MAIN POINTS: 1. The manufacturing ISM declined less than expected to 50.6 in August, down only 0.3 point (versus 2.4 points expected) from July. The details of the report, however, were softer than the headline suggests: while new orders held up (49.6 after 49.2 in July), the production and employment indexes both declined (by 3.7 points to 48.6 and by 1.7 point to 51.8, respectively). Inventories rose (by 3 points to 52.3), pushing the new orders-inventory gap down to -2.7. The prices paid index declined 3.5 points to 55.5. 2. Construction expenditures fell by 1.3% (month-over-month), in contrast to consensus expectations for a small increase. However, the weaker than expected growth rate in July was more than offset by an upward revision to earlier months. The level of total construction expenditures was revised up by 3.6% for July-a large change compared to typical month-to-month variation in this series. We therefore interpret the report as a modest positive. Among the components, the release showed more strength in residential building (once revisions are taken into account), but some weakness in private nonresidential construction and state and local government building. 3. We are lowering our forecast for tomorrow's nonfarm payroll report to +25k, from +50k previously. The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak hiring in late July and August: a sharp deterioration in perceptions of job availability in the latest Conference Board survey, a drop in today's ISM manufacturing employment index, another drop in job advertising, and a soft ADP report. Layoffs seem to have remained low, given steady jobless claims in the 410,000 range, although even here the recent pickup in layoff announcements is a concern.

Talk is the 1.42-1.46 dnt expires today. whats the betting one of these gets taken out today ......they always do.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
this isnt going to end well.... cheers ZH chart of ES vs Credit btw

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thanks Gaz for all the great information. Its much appreciated. Woke up late today, no trading. NFP is not my thing. Wish everybody a good weekend. Steve

--- 帖子 #410 ---
same mate, waiting for pull back to TL's on GU and EU for potential setup. although EU just posted a short off SD zone with stoch divergence. Cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #411 ---
It sure did. Though I can only read the divergence on the 15 Min TF. That lower line it hit 4186 was one of my soft reversal targets. The lower SD zone 4131 was more of hard target, last chance for a reversal. 4 black crows, as if three wasn't enough.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Here are my own screwy levels, from the private stock (don't trust these ) dotted white are very soft reversal warning. dotted green are more serious reversal warning. solid gold are hard reversal warning, last chance before continuation.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
im out mate. got family time next week so may not be posting much. will post when I get the wonder setup!! Cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #414 ---
OK buddy, thanks, see you then. Good weekend.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
one last thing, looking at the 4hr on EU ive identified (using fib retracements levels from last uptrend from 4056 to 4549, that 4162 (78.6%) could potentially offer support which could see us retest the new down TL with potential to either short (should indies confirm) or trade a break out? Macd has already made new lows at the current level relative to when EU macd made 4056 last....divergence cooking but not confirmed. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #416 ---
pictures are better lol

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Yes it certainly could. Chart shows the picture of your setup. Another thing I usually look at at the start of each week is how far price opens in relation to its 50, 100, and 200 EMA's (on the 4hr chart). If the distance is great then I consider that the pair has the potential to be in a distressed state and reverse. In JPY pairs that state of distress can usually last longer than USD based pairs, unless in a strong and proven trend. So yeah its a good look for next week IMO.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
deffo mate, lets wait for that TL kiss.... have a great weekend. Gaz

--- 帖子 #419 ---
-Cheers

--- 帖子 #420 ---
had a nice break!! now back and cant believe the PA!! How you been getting on Steve??

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hey Gaz. Welcome back. I've been getting on pretty good. Got some good GJPY longs before for a cool 55. Positions got more potential in it. Now I'm hanging onto a couple of UCHF shorts and dealing with TL bounces but we'll see. Up and down you know, same as always. I don't know CHF should go south, and if it don't I guess I'll cry myself to sleep tonight. How about you, any trading here and there last week?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
glad the beast (GJ) is treating you well lol nothing done at all last week...dont think my other half would have been pleased but I had such a nice time with the kids that trading was the last thing on my mind. nothing done today - just getting my bearings again!! any charts re UCHF you could post? i'm loathed to short the $ at the moment - risk off etc etc

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Yeah I got some stuff on CHF. Some grids with Happs lines embedded, nice ones. Hold on. (I just closed my positions on those all good.)

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Ok so here are the charts, UC and GC.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
nice lines mate.!!

--- 帖子 #426 ---
ok, this is what i have with the limited look ive taken today....potential short cooking - awaiting stochs confirmation....neg divergence on histo HAPPS SD level @ 1.36453 btw = confluence

--- 帖子 #427 ---
if this TL on the 1hr gets taken out then i'll wait to lad the short on the 4hr TL touch (should I get confirmation)....

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I see where you're coming from and take em where you can get em. EU is at stiff resistance on the H4 but I have a feeling that it might just move down a bit to test support. The potential for a larger retrace does loom is all I'm saying. For myself-well I just haven't traded the EU in a while. But I'd be careful with shorts unless you got your good signal.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Here's a closer look at GC. I've circled this minor line where its found support presently. The larger pattern here implies a greater move down.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
short EU @ 36115 - sl above 1hr TL

--- 帖子 #431 ---
will look to take some profits @ next SD zone of 1.35462 cheers &amp; see u all tom....

--- 帖子 #432 ---
STEVE Thank you so much for this stuff! It was years I was trying to have a similar indi for the metatrash....So thank you again!! Can u pls tell me how I can apply it on Gold?What do I hvae to modify?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hey Scalper- Your welcome, glad you like the indi. Just put the Happs_Phases_Add indi on your gold chart and make sure the high low display is set to true. Then you'll see the hist. high and low for gold appear on your chart in the top left corner. Then add the Happs V4 indi to your chart. Where you see the high and low inputs, which are set to EU by default, enter the data for gold which is displayed in the top left. Turn the draw fibs option to true if you want the fibs to show up. Click OK. Thats it. Change your chart background color to steel blue and turn off the grid display so you can see it better. Save as template, and you are done. Let us know how it turns out. -Steve

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Done!Ant thank you so much! Are you on skype? If yes please add me "crueltrading" I'd like to exchanghe ideas with you during the day.... If u want logically...LOL

--- 帖子 #435 ---
No sorry, I'm not. I got yahoo and msn messenger. Shoot me a PM if you want that info, otherwise you can post here. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Nice Long EU setup on 1hr - divergence and right at Happs 37903 SD level.....stops below up TL

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Morning Gaz, thanks for the setup!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I just want to point out this potential wopper on GZ. Lower TL break on the H4, with technical target pointing to new lows. Perhaps a retest of that TL, and could enter when selling away from it. Anyway its not safe to trade at its present level, need a pullback of some kind.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
you could be onto something there bro

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Could be. Entry's tough right now. Damned if I do, damned if don't. So can only sit back and wait for an op. to present itself.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hey Gazo, are you watching the under for the shorty set-up? Or um, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I guess I don't post that many live trades. Well here's one. GJ sold. Rejection off Happs mid, under-under, stochs lined up. Not that complicated. Now watch it go through the roof.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
That's it I'm already out. +13 and +10 after spread. Up 2.5% on the week. See you next time.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
long EU still the trade imo - main up TL still intact and confluence is in place. close longs on break of this up TL then look for shorts on pull backs. G

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hi mate, not ignoring you btw!! not at my screen all the time at the moment so i'm just nicking some time here and there! i'm still waiting for break of current uptrendline on 1hr TF. will short any breaks of that after a pull back. long for now.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
2.5% every week will suit me just fine!!. i'm 20% away from doubling my account for the year. (not a big account btw) been a lot of 2 steps forward and 3 back but this is turning out to be my best year ever. never had this return up to date so i'm really pleased. but dont get me wrong, I could give this all back in a month if I dont stay humble and keep my wits about me!! stay focused.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
rallied 30 odd since I wrote this lol....go on the EU!!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Good job with that buddy, its not easy. But yeah just a small percent every week will get you rich inside of 5 years on a 10k USD account. That's how I try to do it. If I make a percent in a day I'm pleased as punch. Nice little rally on the EU too. (its hitting the under on that TL so careful...)

--- 帖子 #449 ---
wish I went long from there!! currently in @37957 in teh SD zone - dont mind giving a bit back so long as I never hold onto a falling knife!! like I said tho, the TL is still intact so i'm keeping this one for a bit. there is a good chance of making the next SD zone IMO.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
There ya go

--- 帖子 #451 ---
will take half off @ 38374 and put BE stop on. (if we get there!!) gonna let the rest run as we could get nice quick move to nex SD in the 39320 region. Cheers and GL doing anything nice for the weekend Stevo?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Sounds like a plan. Nice for the weekend? Maybe take in a flick. I guess the beach is always a possibility. Jellyfish season though. How about yourself?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
mate those Jellys s*** me up!! doing stuff with the kids. park etc etc c-r-a-z-y!!!! Rugby world cup on so I'll be watching England land another Victory on Sunday!! Love the beach, but theres not one near me unfort !! do you surf or anything? Gaz

--- 帖子 #454 ---
No surfing man. I tried and failed miserably in Hawaii one year. Just swim, been swimming since I was 5, and waterski, but not in a long time. Good luck with the world cup and the park! Lol. GZ hit the floor and I'm crying my eyes out cause I didn't get a bigger piece of it but the initial sell down off the trend line.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
mate taking something is better then nadda!! I know what you mean though. but just think of the days when you went for the extra pips and got stung. enjoy the swim bud

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Thanks dude. Re GZ, there's still time. Even next week. Here's the technical target 700 points below its current level.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
would like a piece of that!! will take a look at the chart with fresh eyes and let you know. first TP hit on EU....get in!! SD zone here we come!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Have a good weekend Gaz. I'm gonna sign out, get some coffee. Relax time. Maybe I'll post some charts tomorrow or early Sunday. Good weekend all.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
me too. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hit BE stop on Fri remaining piece. oh well at least I got something. Just gone long EU at green SD zone - waiting for Gap to fill!! then will look for short entries.... Cheers

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Yo Gaz, Morning. Hope your weekend was good. I'm trading GC short. Drawn down 20 points on a small position. Have a small short on GZ too. We'll see. GL on the gap fill. Need some coffee. BBL. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
hi mate!! yeah good weekend cheers. i'm long EU @ 36429 - as you've probably seen there was a nice gap down so i'll hold long until this is filled. free money!! the up TL on the 1hr was broken when it gapped so will look for potential short when it gets back up there again to the 4hr down TL which is still intact.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I read somewhere that there is an 80% fill rate on these retail gaps-I guess that means filled in the same week. This one is quite large. Not quite sure about free money though ( ). But it makes sense to me anyway that EU should try to carve out some kind of gradual bull, maybe at some point with a bottom a little lower than its present level. Then either succeed or fail. Something like a bull flag is still in tact on the weekly chart. Its not really technically valid as far as I can tell, but that don't necessarily matter.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Actually scratch that about the bull flag. Its really even lost its shape at this point, and you can see a (partial) rejection off a retest of the lower TL. Or make of it what you will.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
yeah ur right of course, no such thing as a sure thing.....well, not all the time lol just thought it was not a bad RR from current levels. well over 100 pips to fill this bad boy. if EU starts tanking down tho I will get the hell out!!

--- 帖子 #466 ---
out scratch 35......no gap filing at the moment lol

--- 帖子 #467 ---
You'll get em next time. Looks like the mid at 3592 could provide some support though. But better safe than sorry when you're just running down hill. My two positions on GC and GZ are still drawn down about 30 points (including big spread). Mondays suck, lol.

--- 帖子 #468 ---

BTW, gold and silver mysteriously appeared on my IBFX charts yesterday. I guess I can trade those now. So here's the gold template for those that wanted it. Or no, this is funny. They gave me the charts but I can't trade off them. Oh well, template is still good.

i say take it mate - positive stochs divergence on 15m

--- 帖子 #476 ---
attached - just got in myself.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks buddy. We got sort of a negative reaction off the TL. Little crack. If it beats the mid I'll get in. Could hit near the top. But that dotted line just below the mid is its retrace level. If it beats that then will probably go. Otherwise back to the green zone.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
i'm aiming for 377 - got in at 36859

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I'm out +21, wait for the reaction off this confluence. Tis too nasty looking to stay in. My rule of thumb, take their pips before they can take yours.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
My broker has a 13 to 15 pip spread on GZ right now, those idiots. Anyway I sold it again around 9132. Target around 8985.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
UCAD has turned out to be a real cluster-cuss. You can see that's it caught in this sort of vortex between the two happs levels in bright green and the grid intersection. I really don't know which way its going to play out. If it goes to the top it should carry out its expanding pattern, maybe building a diamond with the top at 1.0060. Or if it heads down will target 9765/71. Maybe these extremities make better entrance points than this mid..

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Yo Steve! you've been a busy boy lol confluence building on EU for potential long. PA at SD zone, stock making new lows whilst PA isn't. one to watch. 1hr chart btw - wait for stochs to confirm

--- 帖子 #486 ---
good job mate!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hey Gaz-thanks. Been doing good this week. Made out on the GZ short yesterday too. Then took my first loss for the week on a GC long. Was buying the pennant-stupid mistake, it kind of just scraped a little below where I wanted to see it go and I closed my positions manually. Then it went up and hit my profit target within 25 points, lol. Huge position (huge potential point gain I mean, not a huge loss). Lost cause I got skittish about my stops. Newbie stuff. 2/3rds of a percent- cheap for a good lesson though...Still very positive so far this week.. good morning to you -Steve

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hey you're getting some good action on this long-well spotted! Did you take a position?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
yeah in @ 36520. will take some off @ 36788 (pivot), then move stop to BE. 2nd target 37078

--- 帖子 #490 ---
bounce confirmed....very wary though as QE day!!

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Got you, sounds like a plan. Got to love it when it comes back down to the SD zone then sticks a pin in it and moves back up.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
yeah all i've had thus far this week is a 35 pip loss. was doing ok yesterday then PA came back and hit BE stop so nothing there either. been a tough week so far. today looking like I may get Monday back. we'll see. glad you are making out mate.

my EU short currently 15pips in the red (was worse) however I will hold whilst PA stays below the recent up TL it broke earlier. (on the 1hr TF) also there is negative divergence on the 15min - stochs oversold as PA kissed the old up TL. holding short.... will hit the buy back button if PA breaks recent high (35593 ish)

Hi just dl the template and indicators and looks much like the original blue image on page1. However, subsequent images are with the light brown background which are easier on my eyes. Is this another template or how is that done? Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hey Gaz, bit of a late morning for me. Trying to catch up. No trades for me. Might take it easy, got to see.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
If you want that color on your charts, just load the template then change the chart background to dark Kahki, then re-save the template.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Yeah that sounds about right. You still got cloud cover for now. Could be building a bear flag. There is some bullish divergence on the daily though, plus pins.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
hi mate. we've just stayed below that broken up TL with the last closed 1hr bar so still short for now. so much panic in the market at the moment that I wouldnt fancy going long eu after an 80pip bounce anywayz. you been busy with other stuff mate? any plans for the WE? Gaz

Yeah been busy with taking it easy. Just needed a little rest, family responsibilities plus trading can take it out of you. No special plans for the WE, maybe check out that new flick Killer Elite. P.S. I caved in and bought Black Ops after not buying it all this time, and played through the single player campaign. Pretty good. Not quite as polished as some of the earlier ones. Anyway, here's my look on EU. See the descending red line has been the value for shorts. If the bulls are drawing a line in the sand then you might expect a push higher back up to 3837, and that can form the top of the channel. If not then resistance can play out lower at 3669. But the higher number might be the better bet for shorts.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
yeah Black Ops is good., have a go on Multi Player. gonna buy battlefield 3 as soon as thats out!! cheers for the chart mate. yeah I've also got that down TL on my chart (on the 4hr). would you want to hold EUR over the coming weekend though? will keep a close eye! in the mean time, COFFEE!!

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hold it long? Not in this mess, no way. Wouldn't want to hold it short either. Only jump in on opportunities when they present themselves, early next week most likely.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
didn't think so lol! could we be turning now?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
yeah that new film Elite looks good. let me know if its worth seeing (if you go)....

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Lol, will do. Rotten tomatoes critics gave it 27%. Audience gave it 81%. Hilarious. Should be good.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
always the way! fcuk those critic haters anyway!! i'll make my own mind up as always!! theres guns and action in it....all good!!

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Precisely . I'm gonna grab some lunch. Good luck with your positions. Wish you a fun filled weekend. Happy weekend everyone. -Steve

--- 帖子 #526 ---
recent high held and first tp hit!! get in! 2nd target 1.33068 Stop moved to BE now. GL. hope u had a good WE Stevo. Film any good?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
EU 1hr chart attached. potential reload on EU shorts. MACD making new highs - PA isnt....PA within reach of established down TL. Stochs negative divergence.... thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
btw my 2nd target is a HAPPS SD zone as was the first. (forgot to mention) - this ties in nicely with the bear flag pattern which has played out- ie the amount of pips from the bottom to the top of the flag is pretty much the same as between the break and of flag zone and 1.33068 (those familier with flag patterns and potntial TP zones will understand what I'm talking about - to those that dont, read up on these patterns!!) Gaz

--- 帖子 #529 ---
BE stop hit. waiting for new signal.... Gaz

--- 帖子 #530 ---
next SD zone @ 35432 could hold EUR rally. (R1 pivot just above that level) Neg divergence building on 1hr. have now gone down to 15min to look/wait for any confirmation which could trigger short. will post if I get it. EU although it has dropped a fair way recently still looks v weak and bang in trouble. newbies, remember that just because something is oversold doesnt mean it will turn on a dime!! it doesnt turn until it turns!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #531 ---
chart to back it up.....1hr

--- 帖子 #532 ---
c'mon Steve, out of bed!!!!

--- 帖子 #533 ---
heh, hey Gaz! morning. coffee....

--- 帖子 #534 ---
on my 3rd coffee now!!!

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Yeah film was fine, thanks. Everyone did a good job. Not your standard action flick, more of a real story to it. Nice job on the short, finally came through.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Well this is E, if this is a flag. I'm in short at any rate.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
cool, cheers for heads up. i'll try catch that one this week. just waiting for my 15min to confirm before i enter short but it looks like its going that way. would like a 2nd chance to get in nearer that SD zone it kissed. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #538 ---
ok i'm short now also!! GL

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Cool. I just took half off at the mid +40. Letting the other half run. Stop at BE+1.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
nice one master Jedi!

--- 帖子 #541 ---
enjoying the ride!!

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yep +70 and still rolling!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
wish we could have these everyday!! i'll take off half on any kiss of this next green SD zone coming up!!

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I just took off 2nd half at +88. Waiting for a bounce. Could come at green zone or could come a little higher. We got reference points for an earlier bounce.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
well done son! got a chart re your bounce level pls? nice one. Gaz

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Yeah, these two elements are what I was watching.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
out for +25 - this bounce is sweating me and something is better then nothing!! hat off to you today mate.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks buddy. Get lucky sometimes. Still could go the other way. Lets see how this upwards TL holds up.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
my thoughts are the other way still as conditions are still in place.... we'll soon see! anywayz i'm off. have a good one mate.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
OK Gazo, good trading with you!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
morning Steve!, wouldn't be suprised if you take the day off today what with that coin from yesterday! I smell a breakout in the air!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #552 ---
short triggered

chart

--- 帖子 #555 ---
how annoying - missed that one!! when the PA hit the pivot @ 34781 the stock on my 1hr made new low but obviously pa didnt. screaming buy!! so pissed I didnt see it. anyway down 23 on the day and the boat is missed for the long so i'm gonna take a break. will wait for pull back. may see nice rally in GBP and EUR going into qtr end due to squaring up of positions by the big boys. have a good one! Gaz

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hey Gaz, Sorry I couldn't post this morning. I'm getting run around with family stuff, just not a minute to myself. (not taking time off by choice) Thanks for posting your trades though. Hopefully I can get some stuff up tomorrow morning. Should be able to. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #557 ---

--- 帖子 #562 ---
selling EU and GU at these levels. they broke 4hr up TL last night and now they are testing that up TL again - there is negative divergence at these levels. right at HAPPS SD zones. chartd to follow.

GU 1HR

EU 1HR Chart

575 key resistance for GU - if we blow through that i'm out!!

--- 帖子 #566 ---
36909 on EU - stops above there - if we blow through that GET OUT!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
ok so GU has pierced through the old up TL however i'm waiting to see where the 1hr bar closes. can it breach and close above 1.57046 Happs SD zone (and recent high)? if so then we could be going higher however i'm still on the short side. thoughts/opinions most welcome. Gaz

--- 帖子 #568 ---
My pos in EU is now in the Green....c'mon GU, dont let me down!!

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hey Gazo, I got the same level. Entered at top and took profits near bounce point. Double or nothing from 3666. Pointing to lower SD zone. Stops at 3701. Good RR.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Nice mate!! both in the Green now!! going to hold GU for the ride all the way down!! looking for 1.5225 zone!! smell blood ;-)

--- 帖子 #571 ---
mmm, blood.. , hehe

--- 帖子 #572 ---
EU needs to close below 3631 on 15 min. Looks like just a matter of time.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hey guys, I got to take my 50 pips and run. Can't stay up anymore. But my target projections say we go lower, to 3566 min. H&amp;S seems to be forming on 15 min so could be a bit of a circuitous route. GL. Trade safe.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
take care mate!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I would be interested in seeing your analysis for the 3566 projection. Everything I read on our thread so far, doesn't really show how you use this tempate. For example, I see the fibs, but how do they fit in with the S/P zones you show? Just trying to learn this. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Pls interested to learn more about your indicator. Add me on your trading list. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi dedon, Everything that I know and think about this indicator is located in this thread. If you read through just the first txt I supplied on the first post titled HBPS, (not the Supply Demand txt which is just more philosophical), then read through the actual thread, you will find a complete explanation of its technical design, how it works, why the levels are placed where they are placed. You'll also find good examples in the later part of the thread of how it is used along with other technical indicators such as Stochastics to locate good trades. Gaz posted a lot of good charts, and I've posted some also. So just read that stuff, practice with it, join in and follow along. No holy grail, just a very helpful technical indicator. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #579 ---
It is explained in one of the first few posts how the fibs are placed. They are just standard 23.6, 38.2, 62.8. 76.4 fibs which extend from one SD pivot to the next one. They are used as ways to isolate more minor levels between the SD zones apart from the the 50% mids. I also use the Supertrend NRP new indicator and watch the 15min line along with H1 line to spot further important S/R spots. So the bottom line about the fibs is that you watch them as you watch S1 MR1 R1 etc, lines on a standard S/R indicator. The mids and the SD zones are generally more powerful, but anything can play. How I project price targets is another matter. I could tell you, but...you know the deal . Lets just say they are very educated guesses after a lot of chart time-I don't have the holy grail, no worries. -Thanks

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Looks like a potential sell setup in the making on EU. Diamond is breaking to the downside. Chart shows ideal scenario. Best entry is after retest of the LTL. Down target around 3453.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Getting tweezed on the Daily open/close. I'm stopped out +3 right now. Gonna let this bull do what it has to do and look for possible reentry.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
(hint, look for another rejection off the same LTL, or around 3566/76 to get rejected)

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Frankfurt special, welcome to the jungle.. Hopefully London offers something smoother.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I'm out another +18 on this short, and now I'm done trading this junky PA. But probably, more down.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
your making up for the last couple of quite days son!! hahaha i'm like that too, a couple of days not posting much then go crazy! smell the blood btw ;-)))) still short GU and EU from those highs I pointed out on the old charts yesterday. love days like these....help pay for all those small losers!! like I said tho, especially in the case of GU i'm holding short for a while....wanna take a few hundred out of each of these bad boys!!

--- 帖子 #586 ---
today is ME/QE AND Jewish holiday so PA is gonna be all over the shop today!! (correct me if i'm wrong re the Jewish holiday btw)....

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Congrats on the long holds Gazo. Those are nice positions dude. No idea about the Jewish holiday. I want to say that we might be getting into bull teritory with these lows, but it already passed my targets and I don't really know how deep its going. 3391 is a possibility. Wish I could have got more out of it, but that wicked PA frustrated me a little, so I got what I could and gave up. Happy weekend. Cheerio-Steve

--- 帖子 #588 ---
One thing to ponder over the weekend. Here's a good example of a potential bottleneck trade on GC. See how it's been stuck under this upper yellow line on the Daily, and now after several rejections its broken through and made a close over it. This could result in a wicked bull. If I had been watching for this kind of situation on the UCAD last week I would have been on the right side of the trade and saved my 30 pips.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
cheers mate, took just over 200 on Eu and closed......went down so hard i have to admit i flapped a bit and thought grab it!! hope ur having a good weekend mate. still in GU as I'm expecting more out of this bearish move down. 89 to the good at the moment on that but as a GBP permo bear (fine talk for an englishman) I love to short any weakness in the pair when its with the trend so like I said i'm in this one for a min of a few hun pips +. I will take some profits (if we get there) at the recent low of 5327 then get out the rest @ 5055ish - will get out of the whole thing if the current down TL on the 4hr is broken (by a hr closed candle) to the upside. if you are wondering of which TL I speak up just open a 4hr chart and stand back....you cant miss it!! markets getting nice and trendy now which is a great after the usual summer ranging crap!! OCT good month for that which is giving me extra conviction in holding the GU short.... HAPPS is really really helping me in fine tuning my entries which is improving month on month. broken record time but cant thank Stevo enough for all his hard work on it and then posting it for all. selfless as in this game people tend to keep the good stuff to themselves.... Cheers again Gaz

--- 帖子 #590 ---
hi mate, being the boring old fart that I am i'd be inclined to wait for a pullback to the up TL on the 4hr and look for opps there....

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hey Gazo, Sounds like a plan. I assume that you are speaking of the TL established from the peak on 9/15 to the peak on 9/29. All the rest before the 15th have been broken already.. There is some small bullish divergence on the H4. A close on the H4 under 5531 would negate that. Anyway thanks for the kind words. As long as others such as yourself come along and keep contributing good stuff, then it makes it more than worth it for me to keep contributing. I am continually trying to learn and improve as well.. -Good Weekend

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Yep, that much of a pullback may or may not come. First thing to look to is a retest of the bottleneck line (around 4082/6). If failure, then look for that pullback. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Here's a closer look at that setup. Dotted yellow line is bottleneck.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
BTW, talk about old farts. I'm 41. Sometimes I think about myself at 70 years old playing COD #34 and getting beat bad by some 14 year old kid on multiplayer..

--- 帖子 #595 ---
same here mate, mid thirtys and playing COD (and really getting into it) - how funny!! (or sad lol)....dont think 14 YR's would believe the shit we used to play on (Spectrum 48k with the rubber keys or the commadore 64!! is trading just another game for us? oops can of worms!!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
what TF is that mate?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
That's zoomed in a bit on the H1.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi mate, GU 4hr TL attached.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
OK gotcha, thanks!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Anyone else get long on GC where I suggested? Anyway I'm +115 on these positions. Nice way to start the week. Hitting near the upper SD zone. Maybe we can punch through. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Anyway I got half off at +105. Setting the other half to BE +15 and letting it run.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
thats the way to do it!! good job mate, those pips keep rolling in for you. wasnt familer with that type of setup you showed me the other night but it most deff works!! still sitting on my hands at the moment (short GU).

--- 帖子 #603 ---
That's cool Gazo, bottom line is trade what you know and what you feel confident in. GU is working pretty darn good for you anyway! -Cheers

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Here's a potential setup on GZ. Rising wedge + 50% off the fib fan from the high of 3/13 to the low of this present bull. Showing very good bearish reaction off this level. Chart tries to show that when price hits LTL may give a little bull and kind of stick to the line. You want to see it on the other side of that LTL and selling a little bit away from it before entering short. So its all got to come together that way for a valid entry, most important part-price is on the other side of LTL and selling away from it. Good price targets.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
i like the way you get the confluence on your chart analysis... keep posting man... good job.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
OK nazimu, I'll keep at it. Thanks for posting yourself, and thanks for the encouragement. Cheers-Steve

--- 帖子 #607 ---
morning mate, thought you may find interesting.... A bearish butterfly pattern is currently forming on the GBP/CHF 2hr Chart. The price symmetry is really solid, and so far the the CD leg is moving with with a slightly slower slope than the AB leg. Although this trade idea is against the recent trend, I believe it is strong enough stand on its own due to its time symmetry. The trade is invalidated if the pair drops to 1.4076 before reaching the entry. We are looking to sell the GBP/CHF if it rises to 1.4219 (Point D). Point D is located at the convergence of the following points: 127.2% Fibonacci extension of XA. 161.8% Fibonacci extension of BC. ABCD pattern. To recap, we will look to sell the GBP/CHF at 1.4219 with our stop placed at 1.4271. Our initial profit target is 1.4141 (38.2% of CD).

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Interesting Gazo, thanks for the update. Anyway, I closed 2nd half of GC about an hour ago +50. Don't trade butterfly's, gartley's or bats, but am familiar with the techs. Sounds pretty solid. Anywho, still watching and waiting on GZ. Takes patience to catch the big fish-they like to fight and flop around.. Speaking of, more breaking on the LTL-stay tuned. Cheers-Steve

--- 帖子 #609 ---
nice one dude. just exited half of my short GU 320+ to the good!! love it!! got near the prev lows and I couldnt wait any longer lol.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Cha-Ching

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Its go time for me on the GZ short. LTL has proved to be a difficult entry. The shape of the wedge is sufficiently broken to me, many rejections at the top etc.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
hi mate, word on the street is that there is a lot og EURCHF buying of out the money calls due to the expectation of peg raise. i'm going to grab a piece of that action.... Gaz

--- 帖子 #613 ---
long GU scalp

--- 帖子 #614 ---
PA on 15min - Stochs making new low and PA isnt, (from last touch of 1.54167 HAPPS mid line to present) plus there is up trent line confulence (main trend still down) - stop below 1.54125 - target recent high @ 54920. cheers Gaz

--- 帖子 #615 ---
stopped out scretach 27. NEXT!!

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hey Gaz thanks for posting. Sorry I couldn't be here this morning. More personal stuff. GZ is rolling good, took some off at +100 and the rest is +150 ATM. See if it can make it the long yard. I'm a little annoyed that I couldn't be home to trade the UCAD short. I had it pegged but that's the way it goes. If GJPY can climb more then there could be a real pretty sell trade on the horizon. I'd like to see it approach the weekly pivot at 119.59. Doesn't have to get all the way but that's the area of interest to me. Best, Steve

--- 帖子 #617 ---
BTW this is a pretty interesting area for UCAD. Between 9/2009 and 9/2010 the pair made no less that 11 complete passes through this 400 point corridor. Maybe some more to come?

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Sold GU @5410. Target is 5291. (but watch out @ 5328)

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Stopped out -25 at the TL retest. Missed that bit of divergence on the 15 min. Oh well.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I closed the last part of my GZ trade +305. I'm not taking the bounce again on this fib fan. I think I'm done trading this week. Honestly I'm up almost 8% on my account between these two big positions. I'm a bit worn out so likely to make mistakes. Don't over-trade, protect your profits. -GL All

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Nice short opp on EU. I'm in! near HAPPS mid level btw which adds extra concluence. I attach a lot more trust to these types of setups on the longer TF's....

--- 帖子 #622 ---
mate great work!! also well done on decision to quit while ahead. separates the winners from losers imo!! have a great weekend with the family!! Gaz

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi Gaz, Thanks very much, I wish you a happy weekend also. I do have a bit of analysis on the EU. Interesting picture, basically a flag within a flag, but only one of them can be true (although both of them can be false, possibly). This recent bull forming the C point on the larger H4 flag does itself have a decent 5 count top. Once that LTL is broken then that will become invalid, and its an easy sell down to the lower red SD zone, where its a very easy buy. That potential long at around 3298 is the best looking trade in the lot. Even though that smaller bull flag is still possibly valid I think your entry is fine considering your RR. Have a great weekend. -Steve

--- 帖子 #624 ---
nice charts mate, i'm with your second one. potential to fall further tho imo. if this does bounce off resistance, )basically where we are now, then i will look to TP at last low (3143ish) and then 1.29 (near weekly low of 2873ish)....

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hmm, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. I mean of course the potential is there. But that bull at 3300 looks very technically strong and probable to me, assuming price were to fall off down towards it soon enough to keep that confluence in tact with the lower zone. Guess we'll see. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #626 ---
GU at established down 4hr TL....nice potential short op imo. added to existing. will exit on hr closed bar break up of said down trend line.... also right at HAPPS midline (55363) btw

--- 帖子 #627 ---
agreed mate. difference of opinions makes the world go round!!

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Confirmed break on the UTL. Targeting upper mid, 3592.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
gonna wait for the 4hr closed bar then see. Gaz

--- 帖子 #631 ---
are you long then mate? Gaz

--- 帖子 #632 ---
still holding short. nice divergence on 4hr

--- 帖子 #633 ---
hope everyone got a piece of this action!! grinding higher!!

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Sorry I screwed up that target. Its 3580, a little below the upper mid. I'm not saying it has to go there, but that's the technical target for the flag.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I took a little bit at the retest line for the Daily TL, @3466.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
forex crunch analysis: Technical lines from top to bottom: The swing low of 1.3838 held the pair and after EUR/USD fell to a six month low was a distinct line separating ranges during September and is important resistance on a recovery attempt. 1.3750 managed to cap the pair on a recovery attempt during September and is minor resistance. The round number of 1.37 is is now stronger after preventing further gains. It also served as resistance early in the year. The low of 1.3630 seen in September is weaker now, after being run through. 1.3550 provided support early in September and then switched to resistance after the fall. It worked better as support, but is now resistance. The round number of 1.35 was a trough early in September. The break below this line was significant and it is important resistance now. It is followed by 1.3430 which provided some support, and had a greater role at the beginning of the year. The new bottom at 1.3360 is the next line. The pair is very close to this line, but it is important to remember that it was reached at the late hours of the week. This is a pivotal line. More important support is at 1.3250 which held the pair early in the year. It’s followed by 1.3180 which worked as significant support in December 2010 and is now weak. A key line before the round number of 1.30 is support at 1.3080. Towards the end of 2010, it prevented deeper falls. The round number of 1.30 is eyed by many. Although it wasn’t a significant line of struggle in the past, a break below this line will have a big psychological effect. The ultimate trough of 2011 at 1.2873.

nice one mate. NFP days are always very screwy aren't they! I thought it would print negative....anyways!!

--- 帖子 #638 ---
They are indeed. And this is a complicated little area. Two flags, two channels, and 3 trendlines.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
good job i've no hair or else i'd be pulling it out!! lol

--- 帖子 #640 ---
not far now Stevo!!

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Haha, Thanks man. I'm closing up shop right here at 3505. Getting tweezed at the weekly open price 3515. I wasn't planning to trade today..got sucked in.. See you next time.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
nice one mate.....still holding short due to OB and divergence conditions on the 4hr. think we will see a big move down over next few trading days (maybe starts next Tue).... enjoy your weekend mate and no more trading today!! did you get involved in EURCHF long? could go 1.27 zone....i'm up 105 so far - still at attractive levels. Gaz

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Nope I didn't grab that one. Will check it out over the weekend. Good job on the long and thanks for the reminder. -Cheers

--- 帖子 #644 ---
hows it going mate! nice weekend? thought you might be offline today for the holiday... what about this PA hey. getting creamed on EUR and GU however ECHF long has taken the edge off that. still holding as I believe we are seeing the highs of the week and the way is down!! at least my 4hr chart is telling me that!! I have some pain threshold left so holding tight. you trading today? Gaz

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hey Gaz, No I'm not trading today, though I've been following some pairs closely. Nothing has come together for me is all. My initial speculations for the week were off, so it just made it easy to stay out and watch until I see what I like somewhere. It will be interesting to see if GC makes it to its ultimate pullback area, now in confluence with Happs zone, along with all sorts of divergence. But maybe won't make it. We shall see. Don't know how soon the EU will be turning.. Well, good luck this week. -Steve

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Confirmed break on GZ H&amp;S, with about a 600 point profit target. Retesting now. Still plenty of time to get in there..

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Lots of bearish divergence building up on H4 on EU, plus oval or diamond-like toppish pattern on H1. Could be heading down from here. Just a note of caution to the bulls. (Also seeing stopping volume on the previous bullish H4 bar..)

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Bring the HAPPS back

--- 帖子 #649 ---
OK I had a request for a micro-happs template for AU. Anyone can make a micro-happs template for any pair, and I'm going to explain how to do it in 3 minutes. 1) We will use the indicator, by shrinking it to 2/8ths size. 2) Put the Happs Phases add indicator on your chart, mark show high/low to true. 3) Place TL's on the hist. high and low that appears. 4) Insert 8th's levels on your fib tool. These consist of 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, 62.5, 75, 87.5*, 100. 5) Place fibs from the hist. high to the hist low of your chosen pair. 6) Mark each 8th level with a TL. 7) Remove the fib tool. 8) Apply the Happs V4 indicator: For the hist high: Input the 8th level above current price action. For the hist. low: Input the 8th level below current price action. 9) Make sure that you use at least 2/8ths. That's 1/4 of the chart. This will give you perfect harmonic Happs levels 1/4 the size of regular levels. 10) If price action ever moves above your high or below your low, just change the 8th levels that you are using to accommodate current price. That's it. I'm including Aud/Usd template as an example. Make sure that you have the indicator downloaded, obviously, for it to work. GL. (*edited, mistakenly put 82.5, should be 87.5%) ** you can also use three 8ths or four 8ths if you want them bigger. As long as you are using the 8th's levels for the hist. high and low inputs the harmonics will work.

I just want to post a little commentary about the way the Happs chart often work. This is not meant to be some all-inclusive blanket statement about what must happen or will happen every time. I'm just pointing out something that does and will happen often enough that it will be good to have an awareness of it if you are using these charts. If you notice in the posted chart I've manually placed some extra rectangular zones in the large phase area: I've done this in order to illustrate that very often when price moves out of the smaller phase area, and you think that it has beaten its supply/demand zone, it will reverse on that first fibo in the larger phase area. There is a reason for this. If you follow the logic of the way the Happs charts are constructed, you will understand that the supply/demand zones are set up at fibo-derived distances from the thick white mids. The thin pink mids never got these zones because they are considered to be less important price levels, and they are. But even though this is true, you still see the same dynamic of reversals occurring in the larger phase area at the point where the large phase zones would be if they had been placed. So what does this all mean? It means that you can think of those first fib lines in the large phase area as weak supply/demand zones. Most of the time, when price is moving from within the larger phase area it will react at the regular zones printed on the chart, as the chart I've posted shows. But when it is moving from within the smaller phase area out into the larger phase area, you have to be careful at the first fib line in the larger phase area, and watch out for reversals there. Again, this isn't a hard rule- it won't happen every time, but it will happen often enough that is worth mentioning and explaining. That's it, happy trading.

As always, great contribution. Thanks Steve.

Hey Ferru, Thanks for saying so, and great to see you!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
There's a strong negative confluence at 3290 on EU. Supply + Previous reference + under TL.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Keeping post #650 in mind, if you were in a mind to sell and executed an order at 3300, then presumably: your stop would be above 3322....say +10; and your profit target would be somewhere between 3188 to 3130? Does that sound sensible Steve? Chngster

--- 帖子 #656 ---
The confluence is getting a bit sketchy with all this delay. I wouldn't enter at price but give it some room to drive up into the zone (if it does), then check for reaction. 3300, 3307. Stops behind 3322, and targeting maybe 3210. Something like that. So yeah looks like your thinking pretty much matches my own.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi stevefx, would you place a sell limit order at the place you draw the circle? or that's the place which you'll pay attention to, for a short position?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi Kedridder, at the time I posted I was thinking about placing a selling limit order at 3290. Then it got delayed so much that the confluence was lost and I was thinking to wait and possibly get a better price. In the end I think what happened was that Asia took the price too high too early and then London wasn't willing to make an investment in longs right under supply. So it got left a little short, 5 points. If I'd stayed awake I might have made an entry on its second failure to touch 3290 but I fell asleep. So every trade is different and its also a matter of personal trading style. Sometimes I trade price and sometimes I watch and wait.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
i see. a lot of times, this happen for me too. thanks for the explanation. Cheers

--- 帖子 #660 ---
This does appear to be a very valid H&amp;S break on EU. My plan would be to sell the retrace/retest of the neckline between 3178 and 3188. With about a 22 point stop and a 100 point TP. If the retest doesn't happen its too risky to enter otherwise.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Alrighty I got my shorts in at 3173. 5 points early but what can I say I'm hard up for a fill...

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Very interesting thred Steve.. look forward to reading in detail.. i play with fibo pivots year to week.. a sort of mongrel version of the Amy C method.. yours look like perfect add on..

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Thanks for posting danc. Its a chart for those who like to trade price action and have some skill with it. Trade with the levels and observe price action around them and it will help. Best of luck. -Steve

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Possible short on UCAD. Parity + UTL + Supply Zone + some unproven but potential negative divergence on the stochs.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Looks good Steve, but i think easter holidays are now starting to have an impact on the market. I'm going to wait till next week for more opportunities. Had been quite successful the last 2 weeks playing the EUR/USD 3153 to 3398 broad range with the assistance of a momentum indicator for timing, except got done yesterday for about -1% buying against negative sentiment trying to pick a bottom around 3188 and again at circa 3153. Oh well, serves me right for being impatient. Have a good easter break.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Thanks chngster. Hope to post some more setups in the coming week. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Sorry couldnt help myself with a cheeky short before I head out now to dinner. Saw a sell at the 3153 level again post-London open, shorted. Took half position off for 15 points for risk control, remainder move to break even coz that's it I've had enough for this week. Remainder half to gun for the orders sitting at the april 4 daily low at 3108 hopefully take profit ahead of asian barrier protection interests at 3100. Another random 1/11 of a position left to target the happs at 3054, but I'm not hanging about to find out... I'm off, enjoy your Easter...

--- 帖子 #668 ---
It wasn't that cheeky. You also had the 200 EMA on the M5. It was a good trade. 3054 is questionable right now IMO. But I think you have the right idea taking most out at the mid. Should be tempting support there or a bit lower for some shake. Good show buddy.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Well I guess 3054 wasn't so questionable after all..Tremendous bearish pressure!

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Anyway, UCAD sold. Just peppered it up in the zone. Hopefully I can get around 90 points out of it. We'll see..

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Boom, out +60 on the long bar. Now time for sleep.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
You're right about that, that's more about managing our own psychological state as much as it is money management. Seen too many days where a +30 or +40 turn back to breakeven resulting in follow-up tilt trading. Congrats on that lovely last trade!

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Thanks chngster. Yes more "normal" technical days and you could have seen support being enacted at that level. Or the long bar on my UCAD trade could have snapped back and retraced. So I just try to take the pips I'm happy with, and as the situation warrants. Heavy volume and movement in the markets now, though.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Here's something on AU for a short term possibility. Longer term I think that the support in the lower part of the zone might be good, and I'd like to see a stronger movement up to up to 1.0403/6, where there are stronger bearish confluences. For now though, there is just so much negative confluence happening around 1.0326 that its hard to ignore for a short term trade. Maybe 40 or 50 points, if price were to hit the confluence area, that is. See how it goes.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
This is kind of a complicated and risky trade. Shorting GJ at 130.30. Reasons: 1) Immediate Resistance of Broken Neckline, UTL, Happs Mid, and 23% retrace level from top. 2) Technical target of H&amp;S implies a potential 300 point reward. My main concern is on the H4. Positive confluence at demand with the 200 EMA. This can sometimes really fuel a pair. However, with the markets being what they are, insanely risk off, and the RR involved, I figured what the hell. Anyway, if its going to work, this is the place to sell (at the neckline retest).

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Got stopped for -23 (including spread) on the GJ trade. Got dumped from higher. But, I made about 45 on the AU. Did OK this week. I think in the future I'm going to stop trading off of H&amp;S patterns. The throwback rate is too high. And trading tighter technical confluences is a lot easier and more profitable. So happy Easter everyone. See you then.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Maybe something upcoming here on GZ on the Daily. Clear and proven bullish divergence + TL + Demand Zone.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Looks like the long followed through on GZ. There's a nice clean level for a short right in the upper zone around 1.9553. Three tap + zone + active range. See if price can make it up there..

--- 帖子 #679 ---
This is a very powerful break on Daily UCAD over previous resistance in upper zone. This should make it vulnerable to long continuation (resistance becomes support) in the same area as previous resistance, ie 9995 or so.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
One more for the road. AU, lots of resistance happening at 1.0325 to 1.0330. Isn't trading hard?

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Takes a lot of patience to get a fill sometimes.. Anyway, sold AU avg. 1.0320

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Buying UCAD @ .9998 according to previous chart. Selling AU @ 1.0401. TL + Divergence + Whole number + 200 EMA on Daily Looking at Selling GJPY @ 129.37. 200 EMA on H4 + Divergence + Supply Zone + TL (chart posted is potential GJ trade)

--- 帖子 #683 ---
I'm out on all of my positions. Everything worked out except UCAD, which I mostly just scalped anyway, then lost about 10 pips on the 1/3rd of it I didn't scalp. It might still work out in the long run. My level was just off. This is the problem with taking trades off the Daily chart very often, its difficult to find a precise level. At any rate, I'm up 11% for the week, and I'm done til Monday morning. Maybe I won't post so much next week, since I'm the only one who's posting here and its starting to feel like a chart service. Guess we'll see. Have a good weekend...

Is it possible for some coder that the HIGHS and LOWS in the "Happstrading"-indi will be fix and drawn automatically (and not drawn by the Trader himself ) for a certain amount of period ( lets say for 1 or 5 days i.e.) ? Great if that could be done. Greetings Zack

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hi danc, Sorry you posted when I was sleeping. As for your trade, yes you shorted a few points right below the upper red S/D zone, together with a UTL, and previous tops (If you follow the zone back to Nov 2011), also close to the top back on April second which just fell a little short of hitting that same supply area. If I was onto it I would have posted it something like: Happs Supply + UTL + Previous Top Seems to have caught the mid for the time being for support. Nice trade though.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Great .. Thks Steve for reply .. mite go up and fail again at yr red line?? Good to know i was some were near your area..I am in Aussie.. and usualy shut down abt 1 hr before NY open..will keep posting as per what i see as possible S/R areas.. an will be keen to hear your OPN.. I follow Cable.. EUUD.. USDX and EUx..thats about all my head can stand..

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hey Danc, We've already seen a couple of good rejections at supply on GU, plus a LTL break. So yeah I think it has a good shot to move down to the lower zone area, 5950 or so. Must break 6045 to get started. Will be great to hear your views.. -Steve

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi Steve thanks for contribution such an interesting concept. Just a quick question on how you define the all time high/low of a pair. it seems reasonable for most pairs but for USDJPY for example, the high is 300+ and low is 75, with history extending all the way back to the 70s. What would you do in that case?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Hi Felton, Most of us, including myself, don't have history which extends back past 1990 on any pairs. So with UJ I'd use the high that I have which is 147.70 or so. That's a 25 year high, so I'm not too worried in that case about not having significant enough levels in order to produce good harmonics with the Happs indicator. You can also always shrink your levels in half by just using your median price for a high or low (depending on which side of the median price is trading on). If you use significant levels you will get good harmonics. But the point is, observe the action around the Happs levels for yourself throughout the history of the pair with whatever settings that you use. If you are happy yourself with what you see, then you might choose to utilize it in your trading. Hope that helps. -Steve

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Very good call Ian. I'm still working on that 100% accuracy.. Hope your week is going well buddy. -Steve .......................................................... Sorry I just checked in again here. There were some important levels on EU at that level area too shown from the levels system I use. Happs, trendlines and levels equals $$$$. I hope you had a good trading week buddy. Ian

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Just wanted to say thanks to Steve, observed the levels today and the PA around it and i liked it a lot, for that i am not a indi type of trader. Again, thanks Steve

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I've made a couple of templates for au and eu, including secondary supply/demand zones. I'm beginning to feel that they are too important to completely ignore on the chart. So I tried to make them a color that mostly blends into the background, to emphasize that they are secondary to the primary S/D zones, but visible enough so that you are aware that they are there. This is all manually added so if you get to a point on the chart where they are not complete you may have fill in a few yourself. Basically you can decide for yourself whether you want to use them, or they make the chart too busy for you, or whatever. Just to use them for a little while so you get a good mental idea of where these areas are located might be a good idea though. ---------------------------------------- Secondary Zones are just S/D zones which relate to the thin pink mids, as the regular colored zones relate to the thick white mids. Since they relate to levels which are considered to be less important, in general they should be less powerful than the regular S/D zone levels. Be that as it may, they do and will continue to come into play in powerful ways, and so shouldn't be totally looked over....

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Ok, ThisPip, glad you are having a good experience with the indicator. Thanks for expressing your appreciation and take good care! -Steve

--- 帖子 #705 ---
For those who have, or who will in the future download the templates with secondary zones, I'd be interested in getting some feedback as to whether or not you find them helpful, obstructive, or just generally an improvement or not... Thanks in advance. -Steve

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Thanks for HAPPS and the new secondary zones ... Its really usefull ...

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Ok man, glad its working for you! Secondaries do seem to fill in the missing link, eh? Later I'll try to update with some more precise templates worked out with fib tools, but these should be pretty close for now... -thanks for the feedback, Steve

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Here's a live case on AU. Before adding the secondaries, you'd just see price turning in thin air. Now it makes a bit more sense...Maybe it will push through but at least you know where the resistance is coming from and can anticipate it..

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Hi Steve thankyou. the 3 new happs templates look good. I downloaded them all. lets see how they go.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Ok Ian. Thanks for posting buddy. Let me know what you think when you get a chance...

--- 帖子 #711 ---
This chart shows perfect placement of the secondary zones. Not all the templates have the secondary zones placed perfectly, because I didn't use a fib tool to place all of them. I will be correcting that later in the week. But for now, you can see, all you have to do is add, 17%, 23.6%, 76.4%, and 83% to your fib tool. Then put the 100% at one thin pink mid, and stretch the fibs down to the next thin pink mid. The secondaries will go between the 17% and 23.6%, and 76.4% and 83% areas. Then just put the mid with a horizontal line in the middle. You should see a small space between the regular fib line which the Happs indicator places on the chart, and the top of the secondary zone, and a larger space between the bottom of the secondary zone and the top of the primary zone.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Corrected template for EU.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Great work Steve, thanks for the update. Surely there's a whizz bang coder out there that can adjust the indicator to automatically look for the historical high/low of a currency and use those values instead of us having to input them ourselves? There's some amazing minds over at Steve Hopwood's forum if you are interested in joining us and sharing your Happs ideas. I'm sure one of the coders there would jump on the bandwagon and help code the automatic lookup. http://stevehopwoodforex.com/

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi Jemook, In terms of the coding, I'd be more interested in just a 'show secondary zones' option, even if it could programmed into the Happs Phases Add indi, or something like that.... As far as having the highs and low automatically put in-you know it doesn't really bother me to input the high and low myself, especially since you can save a pair as a template and only have to do it one time. Also, the indicator can be used in different ways, to accommodate different levels, as in 1/4 of the chart, or half the chart, so putting in an auto look-up would basically eliminate those options for people, and you would no longer be able to run micro-levels if that's what you wanted to do. I am actually familiar with Steve's forum and am a member. So we'll see how it goes. But anyway thanks a lot for your input. But also I don't have access to the Happs Indi Source code any more than anyone else. Only one person does, which is the coder, Pat.... -Steve

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thanks for the reply. Happs always boggles my mind and I always have it on my charts. Thanks for introducing it to me

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Ok, no problemo , and thanks for posting your ideas.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
I have been following this thread with lots of interest. Steve, can you post the revised indi alone seperatey pls. Thanks. The candle colour in the template some how i am not used to, so this request.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hi Navk, There is no revised indicator. The indicator is the same as it has always been. The only thing that is new are the secondary zones which I have added manually to the EU template posted above. A few posts back I have also shown how to add these zones to your own charts if you want to add them for other pairs. I will myself be posting more of the templates for the main pairs, GU, AU, EJ, etc, in the coming days. However, if you have a problem with the candle color in the template that I provided, you can right click the chart, go to "Properties", and then change the candle color. Then re-save the template, and that should solve your problem. -Steve

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Oh yah sorry to ask you such stupid question. I changed candle colours as per my wish. Steve, I have to really appreciate your efforts for such wonderful template. The price respects the levels in the template with great dignity. Hats off to you.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Ok nav, thanks very much for saying so. I certainly wish you many good trades with the indicator. Have a good week! -Steve

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I am now looking at 1.2566 which will get hit too. Good. Right now 1.2570 Well, 1.2566 done. Next according to template is 1.2543.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Steve, The FIB levels between S/D pivots. Are they 23 %, 38%, 50 %,61% and 76 % ? It would be nice if those numbers are written in template for easy identification. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Nav, yes the fib lines are those standard numbers, with the 23(.6), and 38(.2), included. The 50% isn't really a fib level in this case. It is, but more importantly its a mid, a derivative of the historical high and low. Its also a 50% fib level of the particular zone that its in, of course. The fibs can be identified by just counting from the bottom, or the top...

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Steve, another level I noticed in your revised template. The blue box, which was not there in earlier revision?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Nav, the first revised templates I posted had the secondary zones (blue box), they just weren't placed perfectly, which I why I posted a corrected version for the EU yesterday. I've already explained the nature of secondary zones in previous posts. They are just weaker but still important versions of the primary zones. As the primary zones relate spatially from the thick white mids, the secondary zones relate in the same way to the thin pink mids. The spatial relationships are derived from fib ratios, so I'm not just guessing where they should be placed. You can go a few posts back and read my initial explanation. There is a chart included there.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Thanx for your explanation Steve. I am done today with trading. I got out at 1.2568 witht he help of your template. Fantastic and thank you very much. I live in Toronto and this afternoon I shall read the whole thread and in doubt will ask you. Once again I say I t is fantastic job.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Ok Nav, you're very welcome. It sounds like you had a good trading day so that's a good thing. You are more than welcome to ask questions in the future. But also please do read through the thread, especially some of the posts that are linked out to in the first post. -happy reading, Steve

--- 帖子 #728 ---
As and when I read i put my questions here. My first question after reading supplydemand txt in first page. ; The blue box is the one which you say 11 - 25 %. ? For example, today the eurusd price hit S/D pivot ( Red rectangular box ), 1.2565, underwhich there is blue box, this is within 11 to 25 % from mid of red rectange box?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
First of all the secondary zones aren't mentioned in the original txt file posted on the first page, because I hadn't included them into the system when I created that document. If you look at the distance from one thick white mid to the next thick white mid, or one thin pink mid to the next thin pink mid, that is called the "base phase height". To determine the placement of the red and green primary zones, it starts at 17% "base phase height" away from the thick white mid, and ends at 23.6% "base phase height" away from the thick white mid. To determine the placement of the secondary zone, it starts at 17% "base phase height" away from the thin pink mid, and ends at 23.6% "base phase height" away from the thin pink mid. So you have two different zones with the same exact spatial relationship from their respective mids. The only difference between them, is that primary zones are in relationship to more important levels, the thick white mids. Secondary zones are in relationship to less important levels, thin pink mids. Therefore, in general , primary zones will be more powerful. However, at any given time, on any given Sunday, you might get an extremely powerful reaction out of a secondary zone. So you must look at what price has done in the past around these levels and add that into your own understanding of what the Happs levels represent in general...

--- 帖子 #730 ---
were do u put u r stops and how do u set target? do u enter white the fractals on the zone?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
...

--- 帖子 #732 ---
watch the white line. Equally important line and turn bearish from there. 1.2604 - 1.2615 are important as they are 200 and 100 HR MA.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
I can describe for you many general trading methods to use with these S/D zones, mids, and fib levels. But what you are really asking me is how to trade-period, and this question I am not prepared to answer at the moment. If you have some trading experience, some awareness of the natural course of price movement and corrections, Support and Resistance, Supply and Demand, Volume or order flow analysis, then the Happs levels will enhance this pre-existing awareness and make your trading that much easier and effective. Happs is not all-in-one. It is meant to supplement and enhance your current trading methods. It provides a background of information that is far greater than say, a standard Daily pivot tool. Personally, these days I lean toward using volume (order flow) analysis in addition to Happs, and I find this to be a very effective combination. There are some very good Youtube video's on order flow. You might check those out.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Here I will show you a little of how I have come to look at these charts with volumes. You see here on the first chart it shows that all peak level activity is occurring on the bearish bars. This implies that as price moves down the Eur is being bought. And then on the bullish bars, you see most of the time volume relaxes, so this means that there is less interest in selling the rallies. You can see this pattern repeating all the way up to closing on Friday. So this tells me that the bulls are serious about a correction at this point, and most likely we are not going to see a break of the low before something more follows through. Therefore I want to buy around the crux of support if I can, which I've identified on the chart as the Happs fib level at 2532. If I pan out on the H4 I can see that price is hovering right over is 50% retracement point from the lows established on June 1. So this point is in close confluence with the next Happs fib level down and behind there is probably a good place to put my stops. If I look to the H1 then I can spot some likely targets using confluence points with fib retracements and the Happs fib levels. I also mind the descending trendline.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Yah steve, 1.2604 is 38 % of the last drop. It it retraces 50 % ( 1.2628 ), I would say the PA is more balanced between bulls and Bears. I hope 1.2604 will play role. Let us see what happens.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
could be speaking too soon....interesting pattern forming on 15bar renko - hope I dont get a wedgie lol

--- 帖子 #745 ---
pop ;-)

--- 帖子 #746 ---
am bearish this morning - see how pmi turns out though....watchin PA like a hawk....any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
oooo bad pmi figure dobby!!

--- 帖子 #748 ---
ok, so 1.56554 mid target hit. will she have the legs for 1.56068 - i think probably yes.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
good trade Mr. Trendy. watching this thread with interest!

--- 帖子 #750 ---
thanks mate, cheers for dropping in. I have seen plenty of lurking and no talking lol would be good if more people pitched in to keep the thread interesting,. Steve welcomes all input and ideas (so long as its constructive). MT

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Actually, I am only paying attention to the big lines...Makes my trading a lot simpler..I am using 5 minutes charts just for a quick entry...Place my stop at the other side of the line . But that's me. In all respect of Steve, of course.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
fair play to you, it is interesting to see how other people are using Happs. have you checked out the micro happs template? better suited to 5m tf.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I took the first short trade on the charts. Right now I am waiting as the market is hoovering inside the red lines..

--- 帖子 #754 ---
nice coin you made there!

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I will check that out..

--- 帖子 #756 ---
it works pretty well. I dont use it myself as I dont use short term charts but i did have a play with it and thought I could make some pips with it - I added some stochs etc to help fine tune entries....also make apply the THV Trix to it.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
late entry 1.2584 target 1.2611 stop 1.2566....let's see what happens.. (long)

--- 帖子 #758 ---
GU is very choppy in current zone isnt it!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
anyone else have any recent trades based off Happs levels?

--- 帖子 #760 ---
yes it is...hope can follow EU..

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Target hit +25 pips...I got out before my predicted target for a few pips..

--- 帖子 #762 ---
well done mate

--- 帖子 #763 ---
well bias is still to the downside for me as PA still hasnt properly broker above the 1.57040 s/d zone. also i'm getting bearish hidden divergence building up on my stochs (1hr tf) - that with the fact PA broke through the most recent up tl is reason enough for me to stick with the downside trade....my mid term view is to look for longs below (PA confirming) at and below 1.56068 down to the 50% fib @ 1.55191 which ties in nice with a HAPPS mid support - looking at med term bias for a moce up to 1.58. cheers and laters!! ;-))))

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I take my trades off the red and green bars and profits are close to the 50 or center line between the red and green bar. i take any where from 30 to 50 pips trading off the hour charts i love the happs template ive been using it for a while 80 to 90% successful i just dont post much busy trading this is what my chart looks like plain and simple no indis just supply and demand thanks steve

--- 帖子 #765 ---
wow nice success rate m8! yeah its deff a great help in looking for S/D zones. to be honest it is the best template I have ever used on MT4 and I have used them all!! lol just my opinion btw, i realise this wont suit everyone. so GU is making its assult on 56554 mid HAPP as we speak. will post chart shortly. gl all....

--- 帖子 #766 ---
as promised....

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Google 'Tales from the Trenches', the rising wedge breakdown which is on the investopedia website for details on how to trade it....

--- 帖子 #768 ---
ok so S/D zone @ 1.56068 is being touched - good place to take profits!! might even be an idea to take partial then put BE stop on for potential move to 1.55357 Mid....just a thought.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
short term trend still down....(obviously lol) nothing much else to say at the moment....

--- 帖子 #770 ---
chart update - pa pulled back to down Tl and HAPPS S/D zpne whilst stochs display hidden divergence....

--- 帖子 #771 ---
1.55357 (mid HAPP) hit....i'm out!! (of short that is)....

--- 帖子 #772 ---
attractive long levels at 1.5519 support area - will wait for PA to confrim by at least breaking current down TL and then retesting before going long.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
chart

--- 帖子 #774 ---
zzzzz price stalling but still in downtrend while latest down trendline is still valid.....no longs yet although i still feel PA will have trouble getting a lot lower from this level....HOWEVER we are not in the game of making crystal ball calls so I will still be watiing for confirmation....on the fence still (for now)!! thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #775 ---
watching the trendline!!

--- 帖子 #776 ---
mng all! so, GU....breakout approaching? kissed 154646 s/d zone - stochs divergence - just need t/d break to confirm - if ur are agressive go long on break or wait for pull back after break (if we get it) - or split position and do both also interesting is that 1.54646 s/d zone is also 61.8 fib retrace on my chart....,(1hr)

--- 帖子 #777 ---
where you at Stevo!?!?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
down tl pierced....

--- 帖子 #779 ---
morning, ok we've hi the 1.55357 mid after breaking down tl - 1.55357 - 1.54646 is the range for now by the looks of things. hopefully pa will breach 1.55357 to the upside....look to buy pull backs over the course of the week on such a break. as said yesterday, aggressive, buy down tl break, or wait for break then buy pull back or split position and do both. stops below bottom of range 1.54646 - I would be inclined to put stops at or slightly below 1.54160 Mid pivot and use 1.56068 as first tp, 1.56554 as second, then 1.57040 for 3rd - if you break your position into 4 you could trail stop remaining piece. be aware that stoch is Overbought

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hey Gaz. Wow long time no see. You happened to come back when I was taking some time off to attend to other matters in my life. Haven't checked the boards in a while... Well, glad to see you back and still trading. I hope you can make use of the new secondary features. I've found them useful myself. talk later. -Steve

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hey jvh- you are certainly very welcome, and I'm glad to hear that you're having such fine success. Take good care, Steve

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Hey wp, If it works for you then work it. Trading exclusively off the main S/D zones, Mids, and secondaries (for entries) while also watching the fib lines for possible exits is a pretty good way to go IMHO. But bottom line, do whatever pays for you. Happs is open-ended!

--- 帖子 #783 ---
What I mean is, if you were to get in long on the GU because you're looking for a reaction off the main zone at the bottom. And you've already seen a previous reaction at the upper fib line, it would be foolish to ignore it if price is making pins again in that area. Maybe you don't want to use it for entry, but at least to get out and not give back your 60 pips. I did take this trade on the GU, btw, but only to the mid.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Thanks for this system brother I sincerely wish you nothing but the best!!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hey no problem man, thanks very much for your well wishing-right back at you...

--- 帖子 #786 ---
EU seems to be giving that DTL a lot of respect. I don't know what's going to happen but it seems like also there is some increased congestion going on and maybe some accumulation at these levels. So maybe later there will be an opportunity out of the lower SD zone. Just something I'm looking at, awaiting some kind of reaction from those levels if even price reaches them.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
yo steve!! hows it going king! hope all is ok with you. yeah still going at it. had ups and downs but getting there. whats are these new features mate? think i'm still using original?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Here's the template for the EU gaz. Basically, all I did was manually add secondary SD zones which relate to the thin pink mids spatially in the same way that the regular primary zones relate to the thick white mids. So these are potential S/D areas also, but just considered secondary to the primary ones. Generally they should be weaker than the primary zones over time, but can still be powerful and are worth watching. They are printed in light blue on the chart. Of course its up to everybody if they want to use them, but I have found that it's worth it, and the change is a positive one. (You can see them on the chart posted above.)

--- 帖子 #789 ---
And yeah I'm good man, thanks for asking. Hope all is cool with you too-may the pips continue to roll in your general direction!

--- 帖子 #790 ---
cheers dude, will have a play. i've been using renko bars with happs recently with good success, after all, they are both price action indies so i think they complement each other well.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Yeah renko with HA, why not. I've looked at that in the past also. Just fooling around though. But I'm sure it can work if you work it... Good to see you back on the board, Gazo.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
not much to say really....GU still ranging (currently at bottom of range) - was suprised it didnt kiss 1.56068 S/D zone.....anyway will let the chart do the talking... still with same plan i posted the other day....

--- 帖子 #793 ---
cheers dude, good to be back.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
mate lovin the new template, very easy on the eye!!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Thanks man. Glad you like it! Here's the one for GU.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
INTERESTING: EURO Reversal on way?? EURUSD has a 13 count buy countdown on TD Sequential today, with the weekly chart up to bar 12 of a similar basing signal. The last 2 weekly 13 counts in EURUSD have occured in July 2008 (SELL) which was the highest weekly close before a 22% decline, and April 2009 (BUY) which was the lowest weekly close ahead of a 15% rally. There has been plenty of talk this week about a sizeable barrier at 1.2200 that has just given way with technical support seen below there at 1.2148/1.2120. Signs of at least a short term base in place if we can close back above 1.2295, with a subsequent break of 1.2424 opening a move to 1.2639. Note from recent fixed income commentaries, we have sell signals completing in Bunds, Bobls, Shatz and also today in ERZ3 futures. Euro fixed income has traded in a reasonably tight inverse correlation to EURUSD over the past couple of months. I am scratching my head a little as to what could be a catalyst for a reversal - and I imagine most people would be in the same boat. That said, it is precisely in those environments where TD Sequential and TD Combo appear to work well - when everyone is convinced the market is headed one way and you actually debate whether you should be highlighting the signal. As noted earlier today, equities look worryingly like they are turning over. We had a buy signal in EURAUD yesterday and that has rallied very well today and would look very progressive if we were to close above 1.2060 tonight. Isn't the EUR now everyone's favourite funding currency? Wasn't that once JPY?? What used to happen to JPY and JPY crosses when things got ugly? How well positioned are people for a big spike in the Euro????

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Ha, nice and timely. EU fidgeting around the lower part of the primary demand. Let us see if it blossoms into a bull or fizzles into more bear...

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Steve, that new blue line caught the recent top of GU so sweet....

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Yeah Gaz, they are useful. Many places...its just reasonable...its the same relationships, just with other mid. So those opps will pop up from time to time for sure. Also catching overshoots when coming out of the small phase. Kinda adds a new dimension...

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Stevefx - the new templates look sweet. Thanks! In previous posts, you mentioned that you manually added the secondary levels. Does this mean that these secondary levels will become obsolete in the future? And that we have to request newly updated templates from you?

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Hi Kokopelli, If a change is made in the historical high or low of a pair, we all already know that the indicator must be readjusted to accommodate the new high or low. So that means that the secondary zones will also have to be manually readjusted. So these templates may at some point become obsolete, if that is what you are asking. But no, you don't have to wait for me to give you new templates if that happens. You can add the levels yourself. I have shown how to do this in post #711. Its easy to do. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...70#post5773970 Glad you like the new template!

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Anyone else buy the last dip into demand on EU? Or am I the one and only fool?

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Not me (because I'm new to the Happs system and don't have the confidence in it yet). Will need to read this whole thread, and ask you questions afterward for clarification. Regarding your long - IMO, the chart looks awfully bearish. If anything, I would be looking for an up bounce to short.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
You could be correct. My reasons, primary demand has stopped price. Price didn't just tear through. The big DTL is busted, and price is still supported over demand. So there is at least some kind of probability that the 23% correction will be made. This takes it near the top of the large phase area. Then its just a matter of R/R. I can make around 80 points while risking 25 points, and have the whole demand space between my entry and my stop... Its Ok.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Anyway I wound up closing my long for +10 after seeing that bearish two bar on the 15 min about 5:30 AM. Went to bed and woke up to see the break-out. Price is tricky sometimes. Probably some good short opps coming up early next week. Have a good week-end..

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Leaving this template by request. Micro levels (5 min) for AJ.

Thanks

That's called scalping into Support/Resistance, nice one--

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Hi Steve, Thanks for the fantastic thread, I'm reading from beginning,,,,I have a question ?, regarding the hist High/Low, i'm getting data which is different to what is mentioned in ur indis which I understand because of the hist data from my broker, so what I want to know is, is there a historical high and low database of all the pairs available with you or on the net, I tried googling and most of them have a max from Jan 1st 1999 (since the euro start) and my broker has data back from 1971 for euro with Low:0.53650 and the high is close to what u have mentioned and the historical start data completely vary from pair to pair with my broker..............Now since historical high &amp; lows are the foundation of Happs I'm unable to implement this without getting this doubt cleared...... I'v also read ur answers to similar questions earlier in the thread but couldn't find the exact answer ,,,,,,,sorry for the long query and sorry if this is a closed issue............ ur guidance would be greatly appreciated.. Regards mahnooj

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi Mahnooj, All I can tell you is that there is no magic about the high and low price. Its about using high/low levels which are significant. The idea that the "historical high/low" is the foundation of Happs is somewhat wrong. The foundation of Happs is really the basic mathematical relationships that indicator applies after you have input high low levels of significance. Its just about the harmonics being derived through these basic relationships. Any strong starting point will do to produce strong harmonics. So most of us have data going back to 1990 on the big pairs which gives us a 22 year high low. That will do it! Trust more in your observation of the history of action off the happs levels that get produced through your inputs, and what is happening off them now, etc..., practice then decide for yourself. Good Luck, Steve

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hey, new to the thread your system seems very well thought out and your explanations are wonderful. How did your trade work out? Your prediction was definitely correct as price shot up, but it seemed to test the low again how did you decide whether or not to take a stop loss.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hey Legace, I closed that out after I kept seeing repeated rejections at the upper fib line. Specifically after priced produced that bearish 2 bar on the 15 min. Was +10, then I went to sleep and woke up to see the break-out... It would have hit my stop by a couple of points if I'd just left it. Sometimes I think its best to put the stop a couple of points below the fib line below the S/D zone, to avoid getting stopped through hunts or minor dips. But then you have a different R/R situation, and this is something we all have to figure out for ourselves, I guess. Glad you like the thread! -Steve

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Hi Steve, Thanks for the reply, I'll work on that and will see how it goes. regards mahnooj

--- 帖子 #816 ---
stevo!! hows it going bud....just had long weekend off, (daughters school sports day etc) - now ready to go again!! well peed off - got taken out of last long postion by a few pips!! then pa went on to hit first then second tp....dont you hate that!! to be fair tho though my TL was drawn all wrong. anywayz went long yesterday on subsequent break then retest (with hidden divergence) of down TL (this time drawn correctly).... did you get this one? hidden divergence came with touch of 1.55357 mid Happs point so was confident of taking it. whats your GU thought mate? i'll get out on break of new up TL or add if it touches up TL with some added confluences (the usual diverg, Happs point etc). Gaz

renko chart - like to use normal and renko to confirm....

--- 帖子 #818 ---
apparently bias is still towards 1.58 for Gu - have to wait and see! anyone have any GU charts/opinions to share?

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hey Gaz, No all I've done this week is take some off the previous down move from the Primary S/D, which happened just previous to the up sequence you are talking about. And tonight scalped EU short off the highs near the upper red S/D primary. EU is testing the upper zone, I'd say watch the corollary to get another perspective for GU.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Other thoughts, both pairs are at range limits of one kind or another. But both also display a bullish expansive pattern in their moving up. So maybe some temporary failure and correction...then resume..

--- 帖子 #821 ---
ok mate. you getting bullish on EU?

--- 帖子 #822 ---
This what I'm talking about when I say expansive pattern. See how it kind of arcs up in a curved fashion. That's the kind of thing that can turn into a nasty bull that just keeps going..

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I guess in medium term I am kind of, for now just taking the short scalps.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi Steve ! Thanks for a really nice thread lots of useful information. I'm still in the process of going through it and learning though. I'm fond of candelstick patterns, particularly engulfing and pin bars. In conjuction with Happs, that seems to be powerful. Took a short this morning at the bearish pin bar near the SD level. Closed half at mid point. Second half set at BE targeting lower SD. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Pins off the S/D's, can't argue with it. Looks like a nice trade you got there! (had a piece of it myself) Keep posting! -Steve

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Second half out at 2220 as PA bounced from RN. +40p on first half and +70p on second one. Will keep posting. Nice thread Steve..!

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Thanks Phiksalamuk, Good trading buddy.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Looking at the H4 closes with the Happs S/D levels has some value. I'm not saying you'll win every trade if you made a system out of it. I'm just saying there's some value there...

--- 帖子 #829 ---
I short EU on the breach of the bearish pin bar. IMO, not a A+ trade here as the pin bar was not perfect and not located at a S/D Zone. However it made a lower high and stoch suggested going short. Currently at break-even. TP1 at 2xRR and TP2 at the lower TL. Will see how PA will react at mid point. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
TP1 reached. Closed half position for + +30pips.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Second half out for +31 pips. Price bounced from ADR low and pink line forming a bullish pin bar. You've got to love pin bars and you 've got to love Happs...!

--- 帖子 #832 ---
I had a pending buy order on EU just above the bullish pin bar but cancelled it as it was not triggered during the following candle. Now going up...!

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Wow, you're cleaning up this week Phik! Good going. I took the night off cause the positioning looked lame last night showing both bullish and bearish signs and moving slow. Went to the casino and won 400$ playing blackjack, lol. Keep up the good trades! Cheers-Steve

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Hey don't worry about it, maybe it will still make a better bottom and give some long ops.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Eeey Steve ! 400$ at blackjack is good as well.....!!

--- 帖子 #836 ---
If the uptrend keeps on during the rest of the day, we will have 3 rising successive pin bars on the daily... There is strong buying as we are at a historical support. May be soon we will be ready for an UT and higher volatility...

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Ha ha, yeah, it doesn't suck...

--- 帖子 #838 ---
If price keeps moving up its going to have a challenge at this bearish confluence area. Descending trendline, secondary supply, and previous top.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Good morning Steve...! A nice place to look for pin bars...! Edit: Trendline now broken...

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Hey Phik, Yes that was scalp territory only, penultimate highs/zone. Was sleeping when it went down. However, I am getting some from the rejection of the primary. Seems like a pretty solid first rejection. Lets see how it holds up.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Yeeeh, tigh stop there. Nice pin on the hourly, but too big for my taste...

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Yeah, went in on the 15 min. I've had a decent week but only a few trades so looking to get a little more.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
This is also what I mean about looking at H4 patterns with supply/demand zones. Pin on H4 left in primary supply with body left in secondary supply. Very bearish.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Out half +30. The other half set to BE. Letting it run.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Nice trade Steve...! May go down to the TL...

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Thanks Phik, 2211 would be the ultimate target for this. Let's see...

--- 帖子 #847 ---
At 1.2230/35, there is a confluence of intermediary TL, pink line and projected ADR low... Watch closely there...

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Thanks man, Price retesting high. Possible second chances...

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Will pass on that one... Don't like the TL Break...

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Its not the only TL in play. I understand your hesitation though. My thinking is just to keep punishing the weakness at limit levels until it doesn't work anymore...

--- 帖子 #851 ---
While reviewing other pairs, I short USDJPY on the break of the pin bar off the SD zone. Clear downtrend + pin bar + SD zone made good reasons IMO. It is a slow mover but I got a very tight SL. Let see... Edit: Sl at BE now.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Out at BE... No cigar this time...

--- 帖子 #853 ---
Hi Steve ! You're still around...? Could'nt trade for some days but back to business today. Took long that big pin bar on USDCAD right through thick white line and DPV. SL quickly at BE without heat. If it could break that resistance, would be a very nice trade.... Let the market decide.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Nice and easy trade. Half out at 1:1 RR (+22p) and half out at SD level (+34p).

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Hey Phik, Of course I'm always around for Happs Don't always post my trades though. Starting slow this week like usual. One trade, the initial bounce, or the retest off the initial bounce off the lower S/D zone on EU. (Which is now broken) So one trade to the good. Good going on the UCAD. I'll post some more of my outlook on the EU later as I see the H4 picture evolve a bit. -Steve BTW-I alway frequently use LC pivots in addition to Happs. Just to get an idea of where the DP is, and where the R2 and S2 levels are. It does make me feel oriented a little better for intraday trading.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Happy you're still around ! Fully agree with you... Happs and pivots give a very good tool to read the chart and set entry/exit.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
So here is how I think: When I look at this picture what I see is a potential opportunity. Clearly there is a downtrend in place, and also clearly another big support level has been broken. Usually when these levels are broken there is a retest on the H4. The EU is particularly good about respecting the mids on the SD zones when it restests on the H4. What I mean is, you look for a bar on the H4 which confirms a close below the SD zone mid on the retest. This pumps up the odds on downward continuation. And not only on downward continuation, but downward continuation in a big way. This is observable throughout the history of the H4 chart. You don't always get the perfect retest situation and entry opportunity to play out, but they do indeed come along pretty often. Anyway this is one thing that I look at for potential set-ups.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Also its worth mentioning that this is kind of a special area coming up from a larger technical standpoint. You have the thousand level at 1.2 and you also have a major league TL on the weekly coming in at 1.1965, which is a confluence point with the top of the secondary demand area in the lower large phase. These levels must be watched if you get into a short position and it goes.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
No trades yesterday. Retest failed, and I was sleeping anyway, otherwise I would have gotten long after the break. Here is one thing I'm eyeing. Keep in mind, I never know. But it seems like a possibility. Would be fine RR. 4 to 1 min. Top of the channel, 200 SMA on the H1. Symmetrical reactions off secondaries. 1.2200 Round number. Etc, etc...

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Nice rally. Second trade of the week, selling EU at 2296. Target area 2222.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Basically, these are the trades that I could personally see this week. The first was just buying into a retest at the S/D zone where respect was already shown. The second one, which was a big one, I was sleeping when it happened. It was a break back up through the SD zone, then buy on retrace. The break was powerful and I would have taken the trade. This third is just a price has reached a limit at the S/D zone and shown sufficient reaction. There's no time to wait for further retest on this. The pin on the H1 is too dramatic. Gotta watch out at the mid though, 2250.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Seeing some setup on UCAD, TL + Demand + Parity defense. Also some mild divergence on the h4 and Daily. 1.0013, and 1.0003 are two possibilities. This is more like a real setup than one of my more speculative ideas. Waiting patiently to see a reaction off the bottom isn't a bad idea either.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
AU is showing the exact opposite setup. Overshoot is always a possibility. Then good to wait for price to get back into channel. Is it possible to go from below the mid? Yeah, but I wouldn't be interested. Catches support lower, fulfills its upper target and your trade is toast. So see how it goes on this one.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Sold Aussie 1.0515 and Bought UCAD 1.0008 as per my charts. Reasonable stops, fat reward.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Too much involved. You'd need an indicator that can create reliable trendlines-there aren't any. You'd need an indicator that can spot divergence reliably-none can. You'd need to recreate the Happs Source code since only the coder has it, and the indi is EX4. Then you'd need coordinate all of these non-existent things into confluences reliably through code...

--- 帖子 #866 ---
This is true and confirmed bearish divergence on EU H1, right at supply.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Hi Steve, do you put the SL on the other side of the zone? TIA for your answer G

--- 帖子 #868 ---
It depends on your view of the trade and of price action. If I am trading near a zone and I think I can get 2 to 1 favorable RR off the trade, at least 90 points say reward, then use around a 45 point stop, or try to get stop behind the first fib line the next level up or down past the zone you're trading. That's the best defense against overshoots and stop hunts. You have secondary supply areas above the main areas, in the large phase, then you have a fib line just past that. Those protect. And you know if that first fib line is blown then your trade most of the time is definitely smoked. But you have to have some kind of reasons why you think price should turn at the zone, other than just that there is a zone there. If I don't think I can beat the mid when I take a trade then stops have to be tighter, like just on the other side of the zone. Right so on Aussie and UCAD I have what I need for RR so I'll use the bigger stop to protect. Other trades like last week's sell off supply on EU, I was pretty much gunning for the mid and would have taken no more than 25 points... Hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #869 ---
One more thing about that. I adjust my SL as price keeps moving. Ex. for AU, the top has been tested for 5 four hour bars. So now I want to see price moving away. This is plenty of time for testing. More tests I interpret as price will probably break through, so I lower my stops some at this point, and reduce my risk.

Hi Stevefx, Just a quick note to tell you how much I enjoy using Happs along with my Keltner bands I have posted my chart of Au trade taken today many thanks again for the use of your strategy it has helped me identify these critical zones. Thanks Micvon

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Hey Micvon, Thanks for posting-I'm glad you like the system. I think your chart is showing that you went long on a break of the mid and took profit at the upper zone... Looks good! I just posted this chart in AU thread, so people wanting to short AU can consider. Doesn't have to play out but is reason for caution with shorting AU now...See if it gets bought around 1.05-1.0495 on retest of this confluence area that it just broke through...

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Here is my AU trades for this week with very limited entries although I managed nearly a trade every day not big wins but all positive-Luv this system

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Very Good Micvon. Glad to see your making the chart your own with your indis. I know what you mean about the small take profits. I fall into that often myself. Then you look at the chart and ask why you didn't hold to the other side-then again On the other hand, if you get good enough at doing something, and just trade the situations and setups you know to be highly probable, even taking small profits you'll beat the market black and blue. You will take the occasional stop of course but as long as you stay balanced, don't overtrade, you'll keep winning. Small TPs, no overtrading, fairly aggressive money management but still sensible, sticking to trading what you know-this way you can keep winning... (just one way)..my 2 cents :nerd: keep posting-Steve

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Actually now that I look over your trades it looks like you're just trading from the mid to zone, or near the zone to take TP, so your taking profit in the right place..interesting..

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Thanks for the reply steve yes I have been trading in that zone all week with success and yes my money management is aggressive I have been locking in my stop at BE around 10 pips and de leveraging also and pull out at the S&amp;D zones I trade like this with 2 other pairs and it makes for a profitable week thus far in the last 2 months I have had 17 wins and 2 losses using the break of the Keltner channel,it is very conservative trading but very safe and positive for me any way,as we speak I pulled out of the AU trade to early it has just hit the green zone ,ah well its friday and NFP day spooks me a little.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Shorting me some Aussie. Bearish Engulfing pattern out of supply..

Closed +16 quick-forgot about NFP craziness.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
UCAD at support. Could put an end to dollar weakness for a while.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
The EU is now totally bullish. This is an excellent example of a bottleneck broken out on the Daily. I posted a chart previously on the GC which was on the H4 which was the same technical set-up and was a successful trade. If you can find a line of resistance or support which has multiple rejections over a long period of time, then you get a powerful close over the rejection level, the usual outcome is that price comes back to test that level and then gets bought back up. So usually there is a sequence of two-bars which make a close right at that level, then after that there are just pins which show further rejection. The entry point for the trade becomes the top or bottom of the bodies of the initial two bar sequence. In this case its the top at 2317 from the Daily close on July 9th. This is also in the Happs demand zone.. Just some thoughts for next week..

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Trying my hand at a short on the EU. Previous top + primary supply + under TL resistance. I took a number of little ones to equal a medium sized one but the average is around 2560.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Hi Steve, nice to see you again! G

--- 帖子 #886 ---
maybe a short coming

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Hey G, yeah you too. Hope your trading is going well.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Yep maybe, I hate when they leave price hanging up in the zone..Usually that leads to a reversal but of course its uncertain. I took about half my risk off anyway, cause I'm only really drawn down about 4 points on the aggregate. Just don't like it when the bulls are so persistent.. (Unless I'm trading long )

Yeah she cleared out nicely...

--- 帖子 #892 ---
what do we have here

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Lol, It looks like ab's power template for august. This one? The levels do seem to fall into close confluence this month... But nobody knows how he determines his levels. The hackers maybe. Anyway, I dealt with ab's influence to the Happs system in the first document I posted. The rest is just the normal confluence that all these kinds of things are bound to fall into... Or is Ab copying Happs. I seriously doubt it. He's a smart dude, no need.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Yeah I know its weird man. I noticed that last night. I copied the happs levels onto my platform because I don't use mt4 took much requotes its not that stable to me so I just use fxcm platform for trading. But adebab I have no clue on how he gets his levels I prefer happs its historical with abedad you have to wait every month for the template god forbids something happens to him again and then he's not able to post.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Yeah even though the levels look the same, especially this month for some reason, they really are very different systems. Happs is really a visual charting system, and every bit of information about how its levels are derived is available for everyone and anyone. Ab's system is all about the esoteric math. But only he understands it, so...Its not exactly something you can grow with as a trader. All the same, no disrepect to the guy. He's done some really ingenious and cool things. He wants to share but he also wants to hold some commercial interests in reserve. That's totally his right. It just doesn't work that well for a lot of others. Still I follow what he does. He says he's coming out with a new calculator soon..super accurate..

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Yeah his stuff is good I've had good and bad trades with it. The only thing I don't like is the calculator its to confusing for me. I'm totally satisfied with happs its so clear I don't trade as much like I use to with numerous trades a day now I average between 3-6 a week and I'm satisfied. Have you every spoke to him via email or facebook. Because ive sent emails and he doesn't respond back.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
No, I never did speak with him at all. I know he cleared out his forum, so I think there is very little public interaction with him. He had some health concerns with an accident of some kind, and he's probably just a busy guy who thinks its easier to have less online interaction. Glad you're doing good with Happs. Less can definitely be more if you're patient and just take the very good trades. Sounds like you're on the right track. Anyhow, I'm dog tired. No trading tonight. Take Care-

--- 帖子 #899 ---
[quote=jvh2811;5970895] Yeah I'm thinking about selling another possible rally up to 2565. Seems to be some volume drop on the smaller TF, and just too many rejections from the top already. Anyway, don't know, you have to sell high in the range cause the bulls are being pricks and not letting it fall. But thinking late in the week and the month probably no new high targets will get met. Better for some fall for bulls to step in lower. 2400, 23xx, etc. Could be wrong but of course there are no risk free trades..

[quote=stevefx;5970973] In the last 2 hr or so I bought gu at the supply and demand zone for 20 pips

--- 帖子 #901 ---
[quote=jvh2811;5971269] I was long on GU from the start of the week. I posted the trade in another thread. Bought at 5763, but closed it out just before @ +100 because of the 76% retrace + UTL confluence..

--- 帖子 #902 ---
[quote=stevefx;5971293] Wow awesome man

--- 帖子 #903 ---
[quote=jvh2811;5971349] Thanks buddy. Its not that hard. All you have to do is spot 3 things and put them together, sometimes 2. So on GU we had Channel Bottom + Previous S/R + Hidden Bullish divergence. Also 38% retrace. If the things are quality things then the trade usually goes.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Btw I am in on this drop.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Here's a list of the usual confluence elements to look for: 1)Retrace: 23, 38, 50, 62, 76 % 2)Upper Trendline, Lower Trendline 3)Stochastic Divergence: These are good but don't take slight divergence for real divergence. Real divergence should jump out at you. Also H1 is min TF for finding Divergence. 4)Previous Support/Resistance shown at potential entry level. 5)Whole numbers, or half numbers. 100's or 50's. 6)Big Moving Averages, Usually 200 EMA, but also 50 and 100. 7) Happs S/D levels can be worked in with any of these, or you can use a blank chart.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
I'm not trading this one, but this is something I found earlier in the week just to give another example. EUR/NZD: Simple 2 part confluence, 38% Retrace (in this case 37.5% which is an alternate) + Previous Bottom/Weekly Closes.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Nice drop. You think a continuation

--- 帖子 #908 ---
What a drop in Gu missed that one

--- 帖子 #909 ---
I think its quite possible. But also likely for a decent size retracement. Seems like maybe back to 2532 or 2543 for now, then maybe some more down. Or it could go straight down. But-its too risky to initiate a short position here. Low intraday targets have been met. So without a retrace, I can't see selling it.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
I was thinking the same will wait for retracements

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Selling the confluence. TL + Previous Top. We'll see how it holds up.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Maybe selling the top of the dollar who knows what Bernanke will say today. What it looks like the range is done for the dollar today maybe I will short

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I believe resistance is shot right there so I believe this will continue going up 2590

--- 帖子 #914 ---
I'm adding to my short position at 2590. I'm selling this area targeting around 2530. This is close to the risk, so OK..

--- 帖子 #915 ---
eh, overshoot, got stopped for 20.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Yeah man I had the feeling and saw it broke 90. 25 pips closed

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I got out between 38 and 50% level

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Nice going. I just got in too early this time. I had my upper targets projected but it was too much bull. Should have sat on it. Oh well, I'm happy to report I'm not right 100% of the time..

Hi Steve and everyone, Nice thread based on how the market really works. I put horizontal lines on EURUSD &amp; GBPUSD charts at 40 &amp; 80 e.g. 1540 &amp; 1580. It's surprising how often price will bounce off those values. Not tried it on other pairs. Cheers, Mike

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Hi Guys, Just posted my charts for the EU/Jpy and EU/Usd plus the au looks like a bearish move the zones are holding,just need the 4hr to help and we are away. Regards Micvon

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Hey Micvon, Yeah I was just looking at EU, H1 bullish divergence still playing out, perhaps just a glitch, and seems like correction is needed before any more meaningful move up. Lower 2735 area is a danger to shorts, and below that 2695. So should be good for something, lets see...

--- 帖子 #934 ---
This could be something on AU. IF it gives the retracement back to at least 1.0449-then in that little 4 point area between .0445 and .0449 you have a 50% retracement on the smaller part of the move, a 17% retracement on the larger move, and an S/R break and retest area all right in the middle of the demand zone. So could be good for 60 points or so up til you start to hit more serious supply. Top must hold and give the retracement.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Oh well, doesn't look like AU is in the mood for giving any retracements back ATM...

--- 帖子 #936 ---
EJ short @ 101.03, could go to 101.10 50% fib + 200 EMA Daily + Round Number + Previous S/R + UTL Happs not required...,this one has em all already...

Hi Happs, Just stumbled across this thread. Really like what you're doing here. I like the indicator. I've been playing around with it, and am finding that it can be very powerful when the green and red phases line up with strong Supply or Demand zones. I'll start posting some charts here. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Anyone still using this besides me? Steve?

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Lots of people still do, I think. But there isn't much more to say about it that hasn't been said already. I haven't been on the site in a couple of months, but I still use it in my trading, even more than I used to. I have one Happs chart and one blank chart open for each pair I trade. That's it. In the past few months I've worked on narrowing down the field of trades I take to just a couple of particular types of confluence set ups. That's about it, doing fine. I hope others are too..

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Stevefx, Glad to see you back! First of all, many thanks for the Happs Indicator... A long while ago, I wrote you a PM (similar to this post)...but had not heard back from you. Anyway, I had a chance to study the Happs in further details - a simple concept...a pre-determined price range is broken into 32-equal "white" parts, and everything else (pink lines, red, green, secondary areas) is based upon these 32 white lines...Brilliant!!! I wonder if you could spend some times to make this indicator even more user-friendly... a) add the code for the "Happs_Phases_add" into the code of the "Happs_Phases_v4"...have the historical hi/lo displayed in the upper left-hand corner of the chart b) the historical hi/lo will be the default values for calculation (but also allow people to enter in different values of their choice, the way you have it currently set up now with the "Happs_Phases_v4") c) add the calculation of the "secondary S/D zones" into the "Happs_Phases_v4" code and give it a true/false display option (the same way you have with the Fib display option) d) add an input field for the equal parts...you currently have it at 32-equal parts, now give the users an option to enter a value of their choosing...for example, I could enter 3, and the code will divide the hi/lo values into 3-equal parts and display white/pink/red/green/secondary/fibs accordingly... This way you don't have to manually add secondaries to each template, don't have worry about different hi/lo values from different brokers, and (most importantly) don't have to set up separate Happs templates for each individual trading instrument... Please let me know what you think, and whether these requests are possible... Again, thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Hi Kokopelli, Your analysis of the Happs system is almost correct. The only thing I would say is that you can group the pink and the white lines together as one basic type of line on the chart. They are all 50% levels of the high and low that you've put into the indicator. (Normally the historical high and low). A distinction is made between the whites and the pinks, which is that the whites are considered more important. There seems to be a drop off in importance as you move from levels 1-4 derivation (whites) to level 5 derivation (pinks). That drop off in importance is to be understood in a general sense, as you can tell by looking at the charts that the pinks can still play an important role in turning price around. Any line on the chart can-its just good to have a sense of which lines are more powerful most of the time. The primary zones are formed from fib ratios in relation to the white mids, and the less important secondary zones are formed from the same fib ratio in relation to the less important pink mids. So, the 50% levels are the backbone, yes. That includes whites and pinks. The zones are the secondary layer, the green and red recatangles, and the less important blue rectangles. The fibs are the third layer. They are formed by stretching regular fibs from between the mids of each primary zone. That's all it is, 1, 2, 3. As far as your suggestions for the indicator. Thanks. Many folks have made suggestions of how to improve the indicator, and many of those suggestions have been good ones. The problem is that the coder is not around anymore and the code is protected-its not open source. As its against site policy to decompile code, there it will stand unless Pat the coder returns, or another coder steps ups and offers to recode the whole thing in an improved fashion. Myself, I don't find it that big of a hassle to enter the high and low just using the Happs Phases Add indi, or to draw in the secondary zones manually. If its done once, the template gets saved and that's it. Anyway, best of luck with everything, and thanks again for your interest and suggestions. -Steve

--- 帖子 #942 ---
HI All, This S/R system sounds interesting. I loaded up the HAPS indicators on a chart and all I see is the indicator names but nothing else. See pic. Is something amiss here? Should I be seeing some horizontal coloured lines? Mike

--- 帖子 #943 ---
It seems that you applied only the "add" indicator. Am I right ? Did you set the indicator with the value given on your chart (high/low) ?

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Mike, you seem to have the Happs Phases Add indicator loaded up, but not the main Happs V4 indicator. OR- You have both indicators on the chart, but you have not changed the values of the High/Low in the main indicator to the UJPY high low values. By default the indicator is set to EUR/USD, which is like 1.6 something and .8 something, which would just show up as a blip on the UJ chart. If that's the case, right click your chart, go to indicators, open up the Happs V4 indicator, then input the high/low values printed at the top left of your UJ chart. -Steve

Hey Ferru, good to see you buddy!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Great to see you back!

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Hi Steve &amp; ferrufx, Thanks for your prompt reply. Wow..entering those highs/lows certainly made a difference! I must have missed the bits about setting up the indicators in your txt explanation. Another thing I don't see on the chart are lines labelled '100%/0% SD Pivots'; should these show? Mike

--- 帖子 #948 ---
The names of lines don't show in the chart. Those are just the mids in the center of the green and red rectangle areas. Supply/Demand Pivot...

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Thanks Steve. Green/Red rectangles..are these the broad lines on the chart below? Is all I need to know about interpreting this method in the texts on your first post, or are there some other nuances? Basically, price moves from Support to resistance &amp; vice versa? Mike

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I would highly suggest you to read the whole thread. Worth your time ...

--- 帖子 #951 ---
As far as using the system to formulate trades, things have developed over time, and so I wouldn't bother with the texts too much in terms of helping you to formulate strategies. Its more important at first to understand the basic meaning of the different levels, which isn't too complicated. The green and red rectangles are the primary Supply/Demand zones. These are generally the most powerful areas on the chart. The thick white mids are 50% levels of the hist high/low, and the pinks are also but less important ones. When you turn the fibs option on in the indicator this further sub-divides the areas between the zones to show more local support and resistance. The easiest trades I have found are just using trendlines in confluence with the primary S/D zones, and also looking to see if you can find some divergence on the stochastics to go along with it. People however use the indicator in a lot of different ways. Its meant to be open ended. There are chart examples in the thread. Also more explanations in the thread. Refer to the first post for charts and important posts about the system. Not so much the texts, except to understand how it was developed. -Steve

--- 帖子 #952 ---
And yeah like Ferru said, just read through the thread, especially after the first ten pages, which was just a lot of still developing and figuring stuff out type posts. There's a lot of info out there.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Ok Steve &amp; Ferufx, will do. Many thanks. Mike

Hi Steve, Been a while. Here is an enhancement you have been discussing Auto High and Low based on Monthly data. Custom High and low. Overrides the auto.

Hi Pat, Its good to see you back. Thanks very much for your efforts in posting an updated indicator. Right now, when I apply the V6 indicator, I'm not seeing any change on my charts. Anyway, here are the instructions for the secondary zone placement: If you place a 100% fib line on any thin pink mid (5th derivative level mid), then place a 0% fib line on the next thin pink mid down, so one pink mid to the next is 100% distance, then- the secondary zones will be placed between 17% and 23.6% of that distance, and 76.4% and 83% of that distance. I hope the chart provided makes it clearer. If you have any questions, please ask. Thanks again, Steve

This newer version has everything I requested for... 1) Automatic high &amp; low - no need to create a separate template for each currency 2) User specified high &amp; low 3) Secondary zones 4) User specified factoring - lower factors for higher time-frames, and vice versa Many Thanks to Pat!!!

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Hmm, not working yet. Maybe its my MT4 build. I'll try downloading the newest one later after I get home from work. Maybe others can post if the new indicator is working for them or not also... I'll post the error I got when I tried to close my chart out with the indicator loaded up. Many Thanks.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Ok I got it working by updating my build from 445 to 500. So anybody running less than 500 may need to update their MT4 builds also. Pat, thanks very much-this is great. Its got everything everybody has requested. If possible, can you please make two small changes? 1) Place horizontal mids in the middle of the secondary zones. 2) Change the default for the Factor setting back to 32 from 16. Buts really that's all I would request. Otherwise its as good as it can be, amazing job. Thanks so much, Steve

Hi Steve, Still using happs have been for 12 months now new v7 is great can I ask if you could provide a scalp temp for GU and EJ I am using 15 min charts for scalping this will complete my pairs I trade I already have your EU and AU microhapps. Many Thanks Mike C ps great to see you guys back

Hi Steve, Should have your request coded. What's "microhapp"? Pat

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Pat, Micro happ is a scalping happ temp steve some time ago posted scalp temps for eu- au aj for 5m and 15 min charts the levels were adjusted for scalping. Mike c

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hi Pat, No need to worry about micro-Happs- you already covered it by including the Factor setting. Micro Happs is just 1/4 size Happs levels, which means you'd go to 7th level. IE, 5th is standard Happs, 6th is half size, 7th is quarter size or micro. In "Factor" terms, factor 32 is standard, factor 64 is half size, factor 128 is quarter size. So, since you can alter the factor, no need to do any more than that. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Micvon, Pat's new V7 covers Micro Happs, as explained above. Just load V7 onto GU and change the "Factor" setting to 128. This will be far more accurate and better than anything I could produce by hand. This is a seriously robust indicator. Thanks-Steve

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Hi Pat1, First I would like to thank you for this wonderful indicator which I use in my day to day trading. I would like to request you for one small modification that would use less of CPU memory when the happs indicator is loaded on multiple currency pairs. I would like you to have a user option to just draw the zones for the happs indy based on the current price. By default it should the zone boxes for just two immediate levels. 2 Zones above the current price and 2 Zones below the current price. User option to modify this to any number that he chooses. This would also help in making the chart look less crowded in case it is used with higher time frame charts with default setting of 32 without changing this default. Your feedback and help is requested for this small change. I would also like to know if the mq4 file is available anywhere as I have not been able to locate the same in the Happs trading strategy posts. Thanks in advance. Fxx Trader

Lets trade Happs.. So I took this long on GZ at 2.0080, off the retrace, right above the primary, cause of bullish divergence on the H1, and bullish looking price patterns off the floor. Confluence of retest of the descending TL and the top of the Primary. All trades posted live in my trade explorer for the time being. Shame or glory lets find out.

Maybe something for later on GU..

One way to evaluate Happs levels is to first evaluate the levels by themselves in a standard Supply and Demand fashion. Here are some basic criterion for determining if a Supply or Demand level is a good one to trade off of: 1)Are there 7 or less candles in the swing formation? Too many candles in the Swing formation show too much indecision at the level. 2)Is the level fresh? This means: Has price touched the zone yet? Less touches are more desirable. 3)Is the level original? This means: Is the level a reaction from another zone, or did it just form on its own? Original levels are more desirable. 4)Does the level show strong departure? A stronger departure from the level means that there was more interest in buying or selling there to begin with, and so when price returns to the level there should also be heightened interest. 5)Is the level accomplished? What has it done after price left it? Did it break a previous high or low? More accomplished levels are more desirable. After a level has been evaluated in its own right, if you apply the Happs indicator, if the Happs level is overlapping the Zone, you can tell more easily weather or not there is likely to be a good reaction off the confluence of the two. Then consider the larger trend, and add other technical factors such as Trendlines, Divergence, RR, and so on...

I am really glad you came back, Steave. A few years ago I download your indi, but forgotten about it. Now I want to make a new strategy and hope your work will be the base. Your indicator is very strong in its idea. I have a few questions. Every level describes us key market levels (zones). But 1. Can we identify the strongest level? 2. Can we say that green zone is better for sell and red zone is better for buy. 3. How to understand where the best place to take profit? For axample, from green zone to green zone or from green/red zone to pink level? 4. How to understand how to control the risks, where to put stops? P.S. Sorry for my english.

Usdjpy. So I have the pink level (middle). I decided to put sell limit and short stop But I have more questions about green zone. Today its a strong zone of support. And If it will be broken it will bacome a zone of resistance. So the next steps. On retest we should sell , stop above the high and the profit on next pink level (119.55) Its all a prior trading plan

And more boring questions. Can you comment the picture. I have too much variants. Please, share your opinion

Hi Goldminer, Thanks for your support. I'll do my best to answer your questions-they are pretty broad. 1) Can we identify the strongest level? 2) Can we say that green zone is better for sell and red zone is better for buy? For number 2, no. There is no simple way to buy on green and sell on red. The colors are just there to make the levels easier to see. In terms of what the indicator does, you should just know that the mids, primary levels, and secondary levels are generally the strongest. Not every time, just in general. Think of the indicator like a heat map, it just shows areas that are more probable than normal. For question number 1, the answer is yes, maybe, or maybe not, it depends on you. I can sometimes use the indicator to find turning points in price, but I never use the indicator by itself. You must find areas of confluence between the indicator and technical elements involved with price-divergences, price patterns, trendlines, etc... This thread is full of posts which talk about that. 3) What's the best area to take profit? Answer: On what kind of trade? You can look at the trade I suggested on GZ yesterday. It took off, from a little lower than I wanted, but it took off. So that's bullish divergence based on the H1 for GZ. In a case like that I would look at the higher secondary level around 2.0225 to take profit. Because there is a previous turning point there that is in confluence with the secondary. Also because strong H1 divergence can produce that basic range of movement on GZ, 250 points or so. If I'm just scalping then I look to local previous turning points which are in confluence with a fib, secondary, primary or mid. Where is price turning? 4) How to understand risk? Risk is a function of what you think you can get out the trade. Do you want a 40 point stop loss on a scalp? No. Is a 40 point stop loss OK on a move that you think you can get 200 points from? Yes. Also ask yourself, is a 40 point stop loss necessary, even on a move that I can make 200 points off of? Can I enter at a level within 10 or 20 points of where I know price should hold up, or else invalidate my trade? Trading price action means that you are connected to price movement through your own understanding-and this is just a result of experience, study and practice. You just have to learn to put the different elements together to make trades. I am also still learning in this and trying to improve myself. Hope some of that is helpful. -Steve

Thank you, thank you and one more thank you. Thats the way I think but decieded to check myself with the author. About the map - I liked. I've got your idea. The posts about usdjpy and sp500 as you like, may explain or not. The main idea I cought. Thank you for clear instruction

Following the numbers I posted on the charts below: 1) You must realize that you are considering selling the pair in a strong bullish trend that is still in tact. The ADX shows all up. Yesterday I considered buying GZ in a strong bearish trend, but I had good technical reasons to do so. What are your technical reasons for wanting to sell? 2) If you're thinking about selling after a break of the lower primary, then a retest and rejection of it, then look at the chart and see how tricky that can be. Look what price has done in the past when the lower primary has been broken. Buyers are coming in just below it and buying it up. 3) If you do manage to get a good short entry in-for TP I would very much be concerned about price turning back at the lower white mid, as it has done once before. 4) If you want to sell from the highs, then OK, I think that is a better idea than the other one. There is a confluence there of previous turning and the upper mid. But also consider that the level is not that accomplished. It has not broken any significant lows, and the trend is still strongly bullish.

Sure thing. Thanks for sharing your questions. -Steve

I can't really comment on SPX, because I don't have it on my broker feed, and I can't look at it from a multiple time frame perspective. The one thing I can say from looking at the chart, is that you should turn on the Show Secondary Zones function in the indicator. Price has turned on a Secondary in your chart but you can't see it because they are not turned on. Secondaries are powerful levels.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Thank you for your answers. Secondaries - are too much information for my eyes. Just for this reason I have turned out it. I decieded to combine happs with my trend strategy (macd, clouds and smothed ashi + price levels.) 1. UsdJpy want to sell according to the price analysis. Untill the pair under 122 its sell. If 122 will be broken, I will not sell the pair. But happs shows very strong levels. It makes clear the power of point. I've got the understanding where my trend indicators are strong. Here the same pictures of sp500 and usdjpy but with trend filters.

I can't the see the weakness in the UJ right now, myself. One thing I can say is that it is retesting a big Supply zone on the monthly chart. The Zone on the monthly is very accomplished as it created an all time low. However it is also more than 300 points high, and price is just at the bottom of it. There is not yet sufficient rejection off it to make it tradeable, at least to me. Your stop is pretty tight in a bullish scenario, usually a few points over the swing high or low is better than right at the swing high or low. Regarding your SPX chart, I think that the sell levels are very good, especially the sell level 1. Price made a previous high there, with a very strong departure-confluence between a standard Supply zone and Happs supply zone, as I was trying to show in one of my recent posts. The zone at sell level 1 is also fresh and original. Its a very good level. Sell zone 2 is a little weaker, you have previous lows in confluence with a mid-price can go from there also, just not as good as sell level 1.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
Here's a detailed trendline analysis of UJ from the Monthly down the H4. The monthly chart also shows the Supply Zone I just mentioned.

So, what do I have and what I expect. GBPUSD (4h) The key price level 1.46. Its a price conflict price between buyers and sellers Possible divergence on MACD Huge volatily drop down without any correction more than 800 pips for small period of time Murrey Math level 0/8 (Daily, 4h, 1h) And the main happs red zone. Order: Buy limit - 1.4652 (yellow line inside the primery zone) Stop - 50 pips (under secondary zone) Profit - plans 250 - 300 pips but dont have exact point Notice: The price touch the boarder of the red zone and doesnt get yellow line inside. Think it will make one more move to limit order. Question to the plan: how to act with the order before FRS meeting

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Here is yesterdays postion. Red zone enter - red zone exit. Opened one more buy at green zone.

Hi Steve, Just found out about a guy from Ukraine selling the indi. gbudy beat me to this by 9 hours. What a coincidence. Pat

--- 帖子 #990 ---
A true gift for all my friends.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Hi Steve and Pat1, I would like you to please refer to my post @ 971 and see if it is possible to make that small modification that I have asked for. I thank you for providing this wonderful indicator. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Hi steve, thanks for sharing this indi with us I was able to grab some nice pips now during Frankfurt Open on the M5 Chart using last month high/low. Many greens to you! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Hi Mr Ma, Nice catch! Looks like you got the factor setting cranked up. Been away working on some stuff. I'll try to post some more here. Thanks to you and everyone else for posting. Cheers, Steve

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Hi Pat, Too funny. Really its your indy, you coded it... Guess the scammers gotta make a living too...

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Hey gbudy thanks for bring this to everyone's attention, and thanks for your compliments about Happs. Best wishes for your trading. -Steve

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Testing different parametrs for happs on various tf came to decision , that factor 21 better than 32 for 1h tf. It"s just my conclusion

--- 帖子 #997 ---
And its really better from green zone - to sell, from red zone - to buy.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
OIL 1h tf Just test, how it would be in this zone

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Steve, I cant understand to the end the role of mids. How to read them

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
interesting indicator by stevefx, leme get something str8? do we draw HH and LL levels inside parameter of indicator n then follow its SupDeM? or we can work with 0 levels HH and LL (default setting) If anyone is STILL using this method profitably, can you summarize the best use of this system/levels, it should help all.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Steve, looking at converting Happs to MQL5, any chance of getting the MQL4 source code. Would really appreciate it, thanks.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
