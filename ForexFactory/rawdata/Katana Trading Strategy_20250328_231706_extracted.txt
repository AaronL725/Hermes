http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/8145/katanajg.jpg -- Welcome to the Katana Trading System -- Named "Katana" because it's the weapon of choice of the Japanese warrior class, the Samurai followed a set of rules that later became known as the " Bushido " In trading having a set of rules is paramount to success. This system is based around using price bars, not time based bars. Price bars in my opinion are far superior in a few ways when compared to time based bars. Price based bars represent price movement, they will not close until price moves a predetermined number of price increments. Where the time based bars close as we know after a set number of minutes, but we're not trading minutes, we're trading price and price is what will pay you. The main advantage of this is that the bars are all the same size. Traditional candlestick charting methods like, outside bars, inside bars and doji have no place on a price based chart, some may consider this a disadvantage. To understand the logic behind this trading strategy, understanding how price moves first will help. Determining the direction of price is the number one priority. In the currency market, price will typically move like this. Consolidate between set levels, then move to the next set level. That is basically how price moves. These set levels typically are bound by price levels. These levels are formed around whole price numbers. The strongest of these levels is the xx00 and xx50 levels. That is for example 1.3600 1.3650 1.3700 etc. Mid point price levels like xx25 and xx75 also affect price, those being 1.3625 and 1.3675 for example. This is how you must view the market. Price consolidation and price moving from one price consolidation level to the next price consilidation level. To determine the direction of price look back on the chart and determine what price is doing. If price is going top left to bottom right it's clear that price is trending down. To make things simple, use a moving average of price to simplify this. The period and type of moving average is of little consequence, what is important is the direction of these moving averages, and where price is in relation to these moving averages. Once the direction of travel of price is determined, then the direction to trade in is then determined. This is the number one priority, determine the direction of price. Now I don't want this thread to turn into an EA construction and testing thread. This thread is designed to show a simple and effective strategy to trade and make money in this market. Next understanding how price reacts to price levels and the signs to look for to consider entering a trade. As I outlined earlier price moves in congestion zones, moving from one congestion zone to the next, typically bound by xx00 xx25 xx50 xx75 levels. Price also will move between these levels frequently. Once we have determined if price is trending and the direction of the trend, the next thing to do is to wait for price to retrace against the trend direction. Once a retracement begins and is recognised as a retracement, the next thing to do is to look for a reason to enter either short or long. To keep things simple I'm not going to talk about price patterns, bar patterns or anything like that. I'm just going to say look at the Stochastic Indicator as a guide as to whether the retracement is a retracement or not, and then look at another Stochastic indicator and use this as a guide as to whether the trend is likely to continue. This is about as simple as it gets. Determining where to put your exit positions, is easily determined by the price bars. Using a fixed number of pips as the exit is also an option, the reason being is that the price bars are all the same size, and as such it's easy to use a fixed number of pips once you have identified a bar to use as the entry bar. Finding a place to exit is also quite easy as well, typically the next price level in the market is where price will react to next, hence this is the region to use as the take profit. I will be posting some charts soon to assist in the understanding behind the logic and the reasons behind entering and exiting positions.

I don't paticularly like indicators too much, however they have their places for making the chart more simple for the new trader. Even for some experienced traders the use of indicators can certainly assist in controlling emotional decisions, removing emotions is what a trading strategy ultimately will do. This is the chart showing the logic behind entries and exits. As you can see moving averages all pointing in one direction indicating it is time to look for a trade. If not pointing in the same direction then no trading. Histogram showing Stochastic Levels, assisting in the identification of possible retracements against the direction of the trend. Price Levels highlighting areas on the chart for exits. By far the best way to show a system in action is to show live charts and live trades as they happen, with some analysis of the charts after the fact. This is what I will be doing in this thread.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
very interesting! I will be watching this thread.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
thanks for sharing, sounds interesting and simple strategy, i would give it t a try

--- 帖子 #5 ---
thnx looks very interesting ,one question how do you get priced base charts on mt4 ?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
are you going to be posting the templete on here with indies ?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Nice to see you have started your own thread. I am a user of Range Bars, so look forward to this thread. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
To answer questions about range/price bars regarding where do obtain and how to generate them, you may need to purchase an Expert or a Script that generates them. I do not paticularly want to answer questions regarding stochastics and what they are and how they are used, it's best that you do some research regarding them and their uses. However saying that, Stochastics are useful for finding retracements when the levels exceed 80 or 20. As for providing indicators and templates this is something which I have yet to decide to do.

Price is a the low of the day, this is always going to be a take profit region espcially when combined with low levels from the day before. Price has moved past the xx25 level, so next level is typically the xx00 levels. Price found resistance at the xx50 levels, and price tends to move from xx50 to xx00 and so on...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Take profit level reached. Now do nothing but wait for another chance to enter after a retracement has presented.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
A potential retracement has started....

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Count me in Musashi... Pete

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Getting some indication that market is currently not in trending mode. That is must wait until it is in trending mode.. At which point will then look for a retracement. Until then do nothing.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is the price moving in congestion, from one level to the next. Typical price movements. Strategy is telling me to do nothing.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
hi musashi, thank you for sharing your ideas with the forum. range bars are a good way to eliminate the noise of time-based charts and s&amp;r at round numbers idea is one I favor (although I couldn't find much opportunity to evaluate in practice up to now). I hope your explanations will guide some of us to better trading. However, if you do not provide any indicator name or the indicators themselves and/or their settings, your thread will not be helpful to any of us. Googling the indies is not problem, but we don't know even know from which pair your screenshots are (apart from the price info). if you be more transparent, I think that will help all of us including you. just my 2c. thanks again and good luck...

--- 帖子 #16 ---
:-) How you know if is there a continuation pattern or a tracing ?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
What size RB's are you using on the chart examples? Looks like about 10 or 12, but I can't match them exactly. Different brokers,of course, probably. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Yes I can understand that there is a need to have such things as trading templates and indicators to copy or imitate trading in such a way as I am describing here. Developing a methodology for trading is one of the most complex tasks that anyone can do. Imitating what others are doing can be even harder without clear instructions. Knowledged gained from such instructions can be very valuable. I'm willing to share methodologies, and I think I have described it fairly well. The use of moving averages, and the combination of stochastics to assist in the identification of retracements against the trend. If I share combinations of indicators and settings and the like, it's inevitable that an EA would be developed and all the associated problems would arise from such things. I think that by sharing the ideas and methodology will inspire others to follow the same path and search out and design trading systems that are right for them. I hope you understand.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The size of the bars is not that important. Currently the chart is set at 10. The reason for 10 is because there is about 2-3 trading opportunities everyday on average. When using bigger bars you potentially will not see a signal for a few days. Which is not really a problem, but what appears on a 25R chart looks very similar to what appears on a 10R chart, the only difference is the time in between setups. I hope this makes sense.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Once prices retrace above any of the moving averages, then I'm not looking to enter trades, I'm only looking to enter trades if price is below or above all of the moving averages and all of the moving averages are set up in the correct way. That is for example 50 ema is above the 100 ema and the 100 ema is above the 200 ema and price is above the 50 ema then long trades will be considered. Opposite for short trades. In this way I will be kept out of ranging markets. If you look at the Stochastic Indicator it can stay above the 50 level for quite some time... in which instance prices are going up... and the Stochastic Indicator can stay below the 50 level for quite some time.. in this case prices are going down...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
That is do nothing in this instance...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Now prices are starting to potentially trend again, at this point I'm starting to look for a retracement, as prices are very close to the moving averages, any sort of retracement at this point will be pushing prices back up above the moving averages, making entries non valid in that case. As you can see I'm not interested in picking tops or bottoms a such... just looking for potential retracements in a trending scenario.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Highlighted areas on the chart to show how price reacts to price levels. Which is the reason why these areas are used as Take Profit regions. Still nothing to indicate a retracement has occured.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I like introduction to the thread..

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Starting to get some movement now... price in trend mode until something lets me know it's not... looking for sufficient retracements and then some continuation signals.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Still shaping up for something... nothing yet...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
hi musashi tankyou for sharing this theared please give me indicator and tempelt thank you so much

--- 帖子 #29 ---
This is the pull back signals that I was waiting for, as you can see enough room for price to reach next price levels in the market and take profits. Some of us have to sleep so unfortunately could not trade this one live.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Nice thread you got here M. I will be keeping on eye on this one aswell as DW's thread.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
seems good . these ways of trading need lots of experiences ! back testing is piece a cake but in live forward testing you should be skillful and also very sharp ! any way the idea behind the method looks great . thx for sharing

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Certainly time to do nothing right now... need to wait for confirmation of some direction.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice strategy Musashi, I see you are an Aussie like me, do you take trades during the Asian session and which pairs do you trade. Regards Staghead

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Price barely moves in asian session, so it's best to avoid it and just wait for the european session to start. EU has the best spreads so that's what I like to trade.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Observe how price bounces around between the levels in the market. Congestion levels, and price moving from one level to the next is how the market moves. Patience is required whilst waiting for the right set up. No need to try to predict which way price will go, just wait for a direction to present itself and then wait for a retracement.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Just trending sideways for the moment, price being held by the xx00 and xx75 levels at this stage... Sideways markets can certainly be traded provided you do not hold outside of the range, but I'm not trading ranges.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Trend filter is not in alignment... no trading at this stage...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Trend filter has not started yet. Notice how prices broke out of that asian congestion bound by the xx00 level. The next level in the market that affected price was the xx25 level, at which point price retraced back to the xx00 level and price found support at that point. This is a tyical price movement.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Price back to the xx00 levels... no trend in place at the moment, so just observing price action as it bounces around between levels. Typically if price closes below the xx00 level it more than likely means that the orders waiting to buy at that level have disappeared and price will tend to head to the next level in the market... that is lower to the xx75 level.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Trending sideways and no trade signals....

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Starting to show signs of a trend now... so next step is to wait for a retracement...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Well the retracement has happened, jsut waiting to see if can get a continuation signal here...

--- 帖子 #43 ---
If this next bar closes down it will be a short signal... if closes above these moving averages then no short trade...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
No trade on that retracement.. as there is no continuation signal. Sideways trending market and still no trade signal... system is doing what it is supposed to do..

--- 帖子 #45 ---
GU is showing some decent movement on the chart, I will keep an eye on this one for a possible retracement... There was a continuation signal on this chart however price retraced past the moving averages making it a non signal.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Musashi, would it be possible to post a template or at the very least your indies, so we can contribute to this thread please, otherwise it's very much like a journal. I mean no disrespect but I'm sure there more people than just myself who would appreciate your system being hands on. Pete

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Not alot happening on EU at the moment... no trades for tdoay, I'll check the chart in the morning to see if there were any trades for the rest of the day....

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yes you are right, I will have to get back to you on this one. Right now it's bed time.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
If you read his posts and charts you can see that M's method is quite simple. He's basically playing the pullbacks WITH the trend. The trend is identified using 3 different moving averages. It doesnt really matter which ones - e.g. use 50, 100, 200. When price is above all 3 and the ma's are pointing up + nice seperation then long trades only. Vice versa for short trades. As for pullbacks, you use stochs to indentify if it is actually a pullback or not. If trend is down (below ma's) then look for a pullback and check that the stochs has pullbacked into the +80 level. Again the settings are not that important. Just stick on any stochs and play with the settings untill you find one that identifies pullbacks with price action against the lowest ma. Above all, look at price action. Indentify obvious sup/res levels (this includes xx00, xx50 levels) and use these levels in combination with the above to look for entry points and exit levels. Please note that I myself am not a successfull trader yet, I am just giving my opinion on what I think M's method is about. M will correct me if Im wrong. I dont think he wants to provide a template or specific settings because someone will create an ea out of it. Im sure M does not take cetain trades even when his 'system' indicates to do so. This is one of the problems with ea's and can only be solved with experience and chart time. Just my opinion though Dan

--- 帖子 #50 ---
GU did give a signal for a continuation, however price was below the moving averages at the time of the signal, making it a non signal. When the market does in fact trend sideways like EU did do today, having a strategy to keep you out of the market is always a good thing, because on those days when the market does indeed give a trend, you will be making money.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sideways trading day.... compared to a trending day... Identify a way to avoid trading on days when it's trending sideways and trade on those days when it's trending and then you will become a much more consistent trader.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
You are very spot on Dan, those that want to actually learn how to trade will put the time and effort required into understanding how price moves and the reason for what makes it move. You will get some losses on days when the market doesn't trend, cannot be avoided, using correct money management and SL : TP ratios it is indeed possible to be profitable. I'm putting my own time and effort into showing how to trade using a very simple strategy. You have given a brief summary of what the logic behind the strategy is. Once you understand the logic behind the strategy it's quite easy to build.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hi nice system. why dont you add different pairs since its a slower system. you are guaranteed to then get 1 pair that trends at least. there is a similar system on FF of course every system depends on the user - nexas intraday bar he uses 4 and 8 rg chart and moving averages also. basically u need a clear valid trend, identified by MAs, and price relative to them, and wait for retrace(but not too much) and candlestick continuation.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi M, Just having a look at your charts. I was wondering if you could explain what made you stay out of the market in the areas indicated below on one of your charts ? The retracements seem valid to me. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers Dan

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Yes you have a good eye for possible trades. Those price bars bouncing off of that xx00 level combined with a previous resistance level is what I look at when trading price alone without indicators.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Musashi, Can you post the indicators and templates if possible. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Getting a nice pull back against a possible trending scenario happening right now on EU... this is looking like a good set up possibly coming...

--- 帖子 #58 ---
GU showing some nice trending action as well

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Got a pull back signal, now just the continuation signal and it's a long...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi M, actually I was looking at the indicators on that chart of yours and it seems the indicators lined up with price. Thats what im confused about .. ?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Been out tonight drinking, just got home and checked the charts, there was a valid long signal on EU which would of turned a profit no problem.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
hmm ... getting a little confused with these charts and the indicator entry singnals. M, can you have a look at this chart below and explain if the the first setup (1) was valid. If not what are the reasons why. As far as I can tell it seems like everthing (PA and indi's lineup). Whats the difference between setups 1 and 2 ? Cheers Dan Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
No confusion there, if I was here I would of taken that trade, which would of resulted in a loss.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This is exactly how it would of looked..

--- 帖子 #65 ---
This retracement just too deep, no trading...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Can you explain this please?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Just means that price pulled back and move below the moving averages, making any continuation signals that occur non trades.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Dan89, the green indicator you are referring to, i think are not entry signals, but they show M if the MAs he is using are in the right order, just a thought, not sure, but since he uses same colored MAs, he needs something to tell him if they r in the right order. I think to trade the retracements, even the stoch is not needed here.., just pure price action would be enough

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Musashi, Could you post a template of your system so we can follow you're trades as they happen? Ian

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Musashi.., Congratulations.., i can only say that. I've seen only another person who used to speak with results and would allow others towards self-discovery.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I'm sharing my charts, but I'm sharing much more than just that, I'm sharing my thoughts as well, there is more to trading than indicators on a chart, I would like to write a comprehensive guide one day, however you must keep in mind that there are many people out there who would take such information and profit by selling it. Hence my reluctance to provide detailed instructions. You make the point that trading the retracements can be done using price action alone, which I agree it can, support and resistance levels in the market combined with price levels are great areas where price will react.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Musashi..., Yeah it is like trying to listen to the "one-hand clap". You are a wise man.., hope to receive more wiser things from you

--- 帖子 #73 ---
hey, nice thread, can you post a template? I would like to have my charts the same as you have! Greets

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Guys, M is unlikey to just post up his template for reasons he has given already. Read his posts from the start and you will find that he has given plenty of information that will allow you to figure out what he is doing/looking at.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks for the reply At least I know im looking at the charts in a similar way

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Mushashi Very interesting thread, Myself until last week I was trading with psychological levels and range bars, I did experiment range bar from 3 to 15, because I wanted to avoid the choppy markets that were bringing me losses. I think the idea to use the 3 emas would be good to avoid certain markets. I will try to experiment with different emas. The other problem I found was that often prices would go further than the next psychological level and I would miss to pocket at least another 25 pips when TP was set. Not sure what can be done about that, maybe you can articulate if you like.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Good thread Musashi - thanks. I won't ask you to provide your template ect. - but on looking at the reaction of price around even numbers - it appears to be as helpfull if not more helpfull than my MTF Pivot Points Indy. Could someone (or Musashi) please post an indy which will create lines at even numbers.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...482#post184482 This will most likely do what you need, and yes you can quite obviously see how price reacts at those levels. Very good area to look at price for entry and exits.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
That's a sell on EU, setting SL to 1.30214 TP at 1.2980

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Wouldn't you take TP at 1.30, the next level?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
All indication is that price will most likely continue lower... hopefully without hitting stop loss first... As I type this the market reversing..

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Not in this case as the next level was the xx00 level and it was too close to my entry, this would not be enough room to make a decent r:r trade. I'm aiming for a minimum of 1.5 x risk on each setup.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I see. Just got stopped out on my short, -9.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hi M, which candle did you enter the break on ? I cant seem to figure it out from that chart you posted. Cheers Dan

--- 帖子 #85 ---
The first candle that printed a red bar on the histogram.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
was it (1) or (2) ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #87 ---
The bar to the right of the one you marked at 2.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi M, Took the same trade last night. I actually entered just a few minutes before you posted. I am trading on IBFX. As I reviewed the trade last night I see on "MY chart" that the 4rb 20 ema was not under the 60 ema. But I was going with what appeared at the time the strength of the 8rb chart. Also, after the fact I noticed I was trading into a solid round number! But it was a good trade even though I was stopped out for a small loss. I say good as I planned my trade and traded my plan. Stop and all. On to the next. On your chart the ema's appeared stacked, I believe that was the difference between platforms and futures vs spot? Did you post a 4 or 8 rb chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi M You might be aware I have been a fan of yours for some time, break a leg with this thread. As much as people will want the template, as you and Dan have said its immaterial exactly what ma's you use, (they are obviously reasonable close given the angle they have on the charts) its probably immaterial what stoch you use (or if you use it at all). Good common sense trend trading with retracements between psych levels. Love it. I will be lurking despite my current sabbatical. A lot of people will benefit me thinks from following here.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I keep waiting for someone to say it but no one has yet... "The Emporer has no clothes" Sorry guys... I have to confess I am not buying into it. I want to be respectful to Mr. Musashi but I have to say that I think he is teasing us and flaunting his profitability. He hints at what is in his charts but won't name the indicators much less the settings that would (maybe) go a long way toward helping some other struggling traders (like me) along. I know... he says he will not reveal the indicators and methodology because someone may develop an EA for it. But that confuses me because there can be only two outcomes from posting the charts but hiding the method. They are... a) he thinks some folks will finally understand his method or b) he thinks no one will understand it. If the answer is a, then why wouldn't those people who finally understand it make an EA of it? Then his fear is realized. If it is b, then why even post at all (other than just to brag about being profitable). Am I alone in being frustrated seeing something that looks like it might work but I cannot figure out which of the thousands of indicator-and-settings combinations is correct for profitability? My bottom line is this Mr. Musashi ... why not just post what you are using (and give a hand up to us newbies) and to heck with what the robot-makers are doing since (according to most posters here) most EA's will likely fail anyway? And, if you think that the the EA-makers will siphon off bucket loads of Forex cash, then just make the EA yourself and put the massive profits in your own pocket? And one more observation please... I think the most appreciated and revered posters in this terrific forum are the ones who post their good ideas along with what tools to use and how to use them. Respectfully, Richard in Colorado

There are countless other threads with everything posted and open source - so why are you still struggling? - it is probably because you haven't yet combined all the best bits of what you have found to work and developed a system you believe in and works for you. This is one of the few systems threads that doesn't provide everything - but rather asks the reader to do some work for themselves. Lets face it - you have read countless threads and are still struggling - so why would these indy's and template suddenly make you profitable - They Won't . Its all good...work harder...the clothes are in front of your face.

always there are the detracters but they give nothing except critisizm but what can one expect these days one sujestion there is a free program called market browser where one can see trend price over any time you want therefore you can see price clearly and the slope of the trend i find it a big help in my trading but please dont let these useless coments from others distract you from giving us as im certain they are just as i can see the normal non contributer distractions one gets on this forum thank you for your ideas

--- 帖子 #94 ---
You need to find your own way mate, that is the only way. Most traders fail because they think they can adapt somebody else way. What works for M does not necessary work for you, you are not M. M is showing his way. Did he help me? Yes I think so and I am looking into it, investing many hours looking at possibilities. I was already trading in a similar way and I am adapting some of his ideas into my way. I hope it help.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
You do not need to use his indicators. The idea is to trade with the Mov Avg's using Range Bars. How you do it and what indicators you use is up to you. Here is a Snap shot of my chart and a trade I took earlier today. I actually entered late, if I had been paying closer attention I should have entered at the little Red arrow. Before you ask, the little Gray circles with arrows and red lines are not indicators. They are created when you drag a closed trade from your trade history into the chart. (MT4) Yes, it was a real trade from my live account. 10 pips on the first 2 units and 20 pips on the last. Just missed getting stopped out!!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi there Richard, No offence taken my friend, If you know anything about creating EA's, then you'll know one thing, they can be optimised, the inputs for each indicator can be optimised, as such it matters not which setting is used for those that create EA's, they will just optimise them based on the criteria used in the strategy. I have no financial interest in this thread, or this methodology. If you have a good read, you'll discover 3 things, trend filter based on moving averages and stochastics. 1. Entries based on pull backs against the trend using stochastics for entry conditions. 2. Exits based on using price levels in the market, previous levels of daily lows or daily highs, previous support resistance levels in the market, trailing the stop in the direction of the trade and average daily range levels (some of which I have not described) 3. Trading can take years to even come close to being profitable, the reason for this is vairied depending on the individual. Controlling emotions is the number one reason, the need to be proven right is the number one contributer towards this and not accepting the fact that you are wrong and not wanting to lose money. Once you identify this trait in you then you'll lose consistently no matter what. Stochastic Indicators using histogram to represent the levels, I think I have hinted at in previous posts, above or below certain levels price is going up or going down. If you know anything at all about indicators you'll know that mostly they just follow price, and at the end of the day if you look at price you'll eventually be able to determine where price will react without even looking at indicators (note this will happen with time). Stochastic indicator is one of the best for a couple of reasons, used in a sideways trending market it can be used to trade the top and bottom of the range, and used in a trending market it can be used to trade the pull backs and continuations. Also one thing to note is that congestion periods, or ranging periods is typically bound by round numbers. No it wont be bound by the round numbers to the pip, price will shoot past and stop and reverse and then there's times when it will shoot right past and head to the next round number. It's really difficult to make money in a ranging market, I know, I have tried. Making money in a trending market is really easy. Trying to stay out of the market when it is ranging, that is the bit that is not so easy. Pirces bouncing around above and below moving averages is a sign that prices are trending sideways, prices bouncing off of an area close the moving averages when they are all spread out and all pointing in the one direction is a sign that prices are trending up or down. Using the stochastic indicator helps with identifying probable areas where the retracements back to the moving averages is likely to stop and then continue, using price levels will also help identify those areas where price will likely stop and continue, and in a trending scenario, this is around previous support, resistance level and xx00, xx25x, xx50 and xx75 levels. If you want to develop an EA based on this method then go right ahead, I'm all for it. If you want to learn how to trade the market then an EA will not teach you this. If you think an EA will make you rich long term, then I'm afraid you'll most likely be dissapointed. If you think an EA will make you rich by selling one, then you are probably right. You are the only one who can make you profitable in this or any other market. If someone finds this thread helpful then great. If not, then you are welcome to look elsewhere. Criticism is expected.

Thanks Mr. Musashi. I did not mean to imply you had any financial interest in starting the thread. I am glad that some have spoken to say you have helped them. That's great. I have no reason to doubt them. Your recent explanation is welcomed as it has shed some light on your method. Thank you! And for you guys who have gotten your panties up in a bunch by my comments and questions... I am not a negative person. I was only speaking (and asking) from my current point of view (as a newbie to this stuff). If people can become profitable by ANY means, I am all for it. Good Day and Trade On! Richard

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Last couple of trading days have been difficult to trade, even for discretionary trading, this time of year it's expected.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yes I agree, yesterday I made 2 trades with this method risking 15 pip per trade during LO: -9 and -7. (trailing stop used). Not bad for a losing day.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Good trading my friend, can clearly see the 1.2.3 pattern evident on the chart.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Enough said, anybody that wants to add to their experience levels should be able to take aspects of this, run with it and see what'll work for them ie put their OWN indi's/settings on. That way you'll see its not the specific indi setting (ma or stoch) that will make, or break, your trading. Far from it IMHO.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
A bearish bar at this level, and I will be shorting, presuming this bar closes below the moving averages.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi Musashi..., Just one request.., when you post a chart, if you could also mention what pair the chart is for.., would be great

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Can you not see the price on the chart? Trading EU primary chart.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
As a matter of interest, GU on the daily chart is showing a farily significant 1.2.3 pattern. Bulls are about on that one.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
There was a pull back signal, however there was no trend continuation signal based on the stochastic indicator. Market ranging still, and no trade based on strategy.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Good thread Musashi. I believe a good trader should be able to trade off any line or MA. My 20pip chart attached, with 21EMA, 50EMA and 100EMA. Not too hard to see some entries, and why I've sat on my hands for the last few days.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Yes, the point being a good trader, or experienced trader or someone who knows how price moves with respect to levels in the market, support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
GU long trade. Moving stops up as prices move up and moving TP levels up as prices move up, based on swing points.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
When the market trends, that's when trading becomes easy...

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Are you paying attention Richard from Colorado?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
And no surprises that my personal pref for ma's 8 and 96 lwma's on 5 min also signalled easy buy trades on both eur and gu. Just showing that the ma's being the same as another trader is not necessary (as much as we may want to copy). Get the trend get the retracement away you go.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
From that chart it looks like your indi's did singnal a continuation. Im asuming the top 3 indi's when they indicate red = short ? Or is the arrow on the chart pointing to the wrong one ?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
EU looks set for continuation move here.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
It's days like today when trending markets make you money...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Pound long trade

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Just keep moving the stop up each time price breaks past those price levels in the market. In this way capturing a trend like this is possible. Once price reaches close to it's Average Daily Range that is a good time to exit your trade.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Probable resistance in this region, that will just about do it.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Nice trading Musashi. Great example of trade management. I like to differentiate between my money management vs. trade management.

Updated chart;

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Today was even better on Cable, again with 20pip range bars, and 21EMA and 100EMA.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Price stopped at a 50% retracement of recent move. This is a good sign of a trend.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry dan, If you look at the chart, you can see the bars which are printing blue, those are the bars used to indicate the pull back against the direction of the move. In an up move they will print brown and in a down move they're printing blue. The bottom histogram indicates the trend continuation, when it prints red that means short and when it prints green it means longs. Providing all other trade conditions are met. Is that a good enough explanation. Moving averages pointing in one direction, stochastic filter for trend, stochastic filter for pull backs, stochastic filter for continuation.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
You are totally correct Vantage, as long as you have something to define the direction of the trade, it really matters little which way you do decide to define trend, since all indicators use price data to determine such things, they are all basically giving you the same information with slight differences. Defining a pull back or retracement is what is needed, using price levels, fibonacci ratios, previous levels of intraday support or resistance, and previous day lows or highs is a good way to identify potential areas on the chart where price will stop, and then do something else. It's these areas that we need to concentrate efforts on. For example looking at the price action on EU there's a level it stopped at which is 50% of the move up. There's a previous intraday support level, also high of the day from the 16th Dec. Does it mean price will continue to the upside from here, quite possibly. Guess we'll soon see. 1.3050 is a good region to see how price reacts. No doubt about it.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
GU chart, some levels where price reacted. xx25 and the xx50 levels. Momentum of price is to the upside at this point. When market trends that when you make money.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hello Musashi, Although my trading style is a bit different from your Katana Strategy, I have found a lot of elements that I agree with and thought I should just drop by to say hello. This is no doubt a 5 start thread and I have voted accordingly. Since I can only be in front of screen for a couple of hours a day, I scalp around Euro/London open hours with a hard TP of a few pips, where I found Range Bar is a great help in erasing noise. Since it is a small TP scalp, I trade both retrace as well as range break out. The range in my case is 4 pips atm - may want to increase it to 6 or 7. Keep up the great work Musashi, and thanks for sharing your strategy. Akira

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Well I certainly hope it's helping others who are involved in this market. Because what I'm showing here following price bars and retracements, looking for key levels of price, previous support resistance levels, whole price numbers basically describes how the market moves, once you understand how the market moves, that's most of the hard work done. Controlling emotional decision is by far the most difficult thing to do. Which is why having a mechanical approach is of great benefit. I'm not saying it's the only way, just that it's one way. At the end of the day it's the individual trader who is in control of what he or she does and that's it. Learning about the way price moves and where it's likely to react is 90% of the battle. Trade management is 10%.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Price certainly did contine after finding support at that 50% retracement level. Combined with previoius intraday support level. All in hindsight though right.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Cannot hope for too much of a move in asian session... however bulls are about.. TP 20 Pips and SL 15 Pips. Trading is full of uncertainty, but it doesn't matter, you don't need to be certain, you just need to be following the direction of the trend and look for a retracement, have a clear exit spot and a clear take profit spot. Once you have them, there's nothing much more you can do. 1.3150 is possible, overnight highs could be a bit of a problem however. No risk, no reward as they say.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Price responding to that xx25 level, faily typical, seems a pull back agian is likely. Low probability entry trading right into resistance, combined with xx25 price levels. That's trading though and nothing is certain, all I know is that prices tend to move from xx00 to xx50 regularly and the next price level is the xx00 level.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Possible H/L formation after the close of that bar, not confirmed as H/L until a fresh daily high is made. Still bullish though. Moving stop up under that bar is not a bad idea.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
This is one method you can use to calculate where price could potentially move to, extend the length of AB and then extend this length from perceived swing low CD, and this will give possible TP region. AB - CD move is quite common. Just another tool you can use to assist in trading. One that is very useful.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Not surprised i got stopped out.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Difficult to stop price momentum like this... went long as soon as the first bullish bar formed bouncing off of the xx00 level.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
If all goes well 1.3180 could be reached this session.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Moved stop up beneath the xx25 level under that bullish candle.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Ok moved stops up again, but this time I've scaled out of the position by half. This wave up could be almost exhausted

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Decided to close the other half of the trade, some resistance around these levels on the higher time frames.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
There was a couple of chances to trade on GU according to the strategy. Trading on days like these is when you make money...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Masashi Nice method

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Yes indeed, notice how price bounces around the xx25 xx50 xx75 xx00 levels and moves between them frequently. Trending markets are easy, staying out of the market when it's not trendy that's the difficult bit. As you can see many opportunities to trade when it's trending, and not many when it's ranging.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
As you can see, it is indeed possible to make money in this market.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
what indicators do you uses for filter ??

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Moving averages and stochastics....

--- 帖子 #145 ---
ok ! thank you ! you very good ! very very good !

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Has anyone managed to figure out how to use stochastics as 1) to signal a pullback (2) to signal a continuation, both with the trend Ive been trying out various different settings and I cant seem to get anything that is anywhere near accurate. Cheers Dan

--- 帖子 #147 ---
could not resist taking this one for a quick 10 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Shanexx, have you figured out how M uses his stochs for pullback and entry ?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi Dan dont really use M's settings, came up with my own, but it matches pretty well. Just look for the trend, then make sure you have momentum to support the trend, wait for the pullback,wait for a bar that confirms a continuation of both trend and momentum. I enter on the break of that bar. If you know the retracementfinder indi use that instead of the stochs. Make it suite you not the other way around. Oh dont forget the momentum indi, you can use 8 for starters: sell&lt;0&gt;buy. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thanks for the reply shanexx. Any chance you could share you settings on your stochs ?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Dan With pleasure, 200 &amp; 8 the rest stays as is. Remember we are trading for the crumbs so you have to adapt.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Cheers Ive just tried out those settings on a 10 pips range bar chart and im getting something very different to your charts are you using %k = 200 %D = 8 Slowing = 8 ? im also using Color Stochastic v1.02 ... unless yours is different ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Looking at EU from the overnight session for me, there was one trade which could of been taken after a pull back against the trend was identified using the stochastic, previous intraday resistance combined with the xx50 level, once price signalled the continuation, price moved to the next level in the market being the xx25 level. Right at the moment prices haven't moved too much this asian session, and all indication is pointing to short side at this stage, just waiting to see how things go prior to european markets open.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
GU could well be going short... all pointing towards a good short this session.. Above xx75 not likely to be going short though..

--- 帖子 #155 ---
EU retracing back up above moving averages, and showing some signs of a possible ranging market coming up this session. Need a close below the moving averages and some red bars on the histogram. Otherwise no trading.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Sorry about that I gave you the wrong settings. Here is a picture with old skool it should clear everything up. Sorry. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Observe how price has responded to this xx75 level first as support then as resistance. One of the things to identify on a chart when looking for possible entries for a trade.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
That's it mate, you've got the right idea.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Shorting as prices are going up, is generally not a good idea, it's best to wait until they start to go down before shorting.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
This is how you can be kept out of the market when it ranges... initally it looked like short side was the way to go, however after the first sign of a pull back presented against the trend, blue bars, there was no sign of continuation.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Ranging day... prices starting to show signs of a down move here... Caution required though, see what happens if price retraces back up to xx75 on EU. Appears sellers are about though...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
why don't see the level XX50 ?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Yea it's stopping at that level and previous support level there, intraday reversal since prices couldn't hold the highs, rejection off of the xx75 level indicating a possible move down. Prices below moving averages and they've crossed down. All indication is pointing down, just waiting for some more confirmation and rejection at this level.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Cheers mate, Are those stoch settings (100,3,3) and (5,3,3) the same ones you use for the color stochastic bars. I seem to still be getting different results, especially the bottom one.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I have no clue why its doing that. See what happens when you check it against the old skool. I dont see a broker feed prob your bars are the same as mine - South African time zone. I'll try and see what happens if I use a different broker.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
That strategy looks nice. It looks like a combination of trend, momentum and support/resistance trading. I like the idea and will give it a try. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Price reacts pretty well to those levels..... well that's a sell signal for me... but could be risky with that xx50 level staring right in the face...

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi mate, Im using FxPro . Post up your color stoch indi if you can, ill check it against my version to see if theres any difference

There's a rising trendline in this vicinity.....

--- 帖子 #175 ---
GU coming back to xx75 and previous intraday resistance... could be worth a look at shorting it...

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Guess not, prices retracing past the moving averages, and stochastics turning up.... Clearly see why I use price levels and previous support and resistance levels as the take profit levels. Almost 50 pips right off of that xx50 level on the pound. Well that's it for me, hope these charts are helping you understand about how the market moves, and what to look for. Take care.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Looking at the chart to see what happened for the rest of the session after I went to bed, I can see another pull back against the trend occured, resistance was evident at the xx50 level, however trading that signal would of resulted in a loss. But that's what the chart should like like. Cannot avoid some losses all the time.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
M, Which broker are you using ?

Hi I tried to understand how you understand that the price is not able to break, say, 1,3000 resistance? I mean, when it is better to short in this case? Say, I wait for the 3rd bar to close down and I am in? or what? And, yes, could you please share your template and indicators? Onegai!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I'm not quite sure I can answer this question, however previous intraday support or resistance combined with xx00 xx50, then waiting for confirmation from continuaiton stochastic to indicate the pull back is potentially finished. This is the nuts and bolts of the trading plan, and using the moving averages and stochastics to indicate trend or direction to trade. That's pretty much it.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hi Musashi, Just wanted to ask you or whoever using the stoch bar, does it need refreshing when used in a range bar chart?.., coz i've noticed sometimes when i refresh the indicator panel, it shows different colors than what was actually there

--- 帖子 #189 ---
No, it wont change, only changes on open bar if it goes above or below the set level as the moves up and down, however once the bar closes, the levels wont change. Hence the bars don't change color. Not sure how you could of noticed a change in color unless the bars have changed after closing, not sure how this could happen, I haven't seen it happen using my range bar expert.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Yeah.., even i'm wondering about that.., maybe it does not happen when i use the normal stoch, but when it comes to bars, i've noticed it a couple of times.., i will still check and see if it really is the case.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Just remember range bar uses m1 to generate the bars. Only way for the range bars to change is if the m1 data changes.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Mushashi.., Please don't mistake.., i'm not talking about range bars, but the stoch bars..., i just saw one now, which had printed already and now the other bar was forming, as soon as i refreshed, the color of the previous bar also changed ..

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Post this indicator here for me to check please.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Mushashi, Here you go.., any help in this regard is greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I will try to replicate this on m1 time frame.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I screen captured an image of the chart showing the histogram bars using arrows to indicate green and red bars. I restarted the platform and then compared the bars. I found one bar that was not the same color after the restart. In other words after the data was refreshed from the broker after a restart the bars on the m1 changed slightly for whatever reason. This obviously has affected the histogram color as the level is different because the bar size changed slightly after the restart. Note the level that was used was 50.001 for overbought and 50 for oversold. So it seems that you are correct one of the bars on the histogram has changed color after a restart of the platform, based on the m1 bar variation.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Mushashi.., Yeah., that is what is bothering me right now.., do u have a suggestion please?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Sorry for my english...wat's the parameters of moving average and sthocastic? Thanks

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would not be too concerned by this. What is important is the level of the pull back against the trend, for example if you are interested in price once it reaches a level of 80 a change of 0.01 can potentially change one bar, and only one bar. This is not going to make or break a strategy. All this means is that you may or may not miss a single trade on visual backtesting, when in a live chart you may enter or you may not enter based on this level. I would not say this is a major problem. A major problem would be an indicator that after refresh changes more than one bar at a time, like some I've seen where up to 7 bars can change after a refresh. Repainting can be a serious problem, no doubt about it.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
It is of little consequence which moving average period you use to determine the trend. 50 100 150 or 40 90 140... do you see my point.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thanks....

--- 帖子 #202 ---
What's important is that the moving averages are in the same direction and that price is not above any of them if you are wanting to short.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Pull back occured and then continuation, this is what to look for..

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hi M, Just wondering .. do you trade other pairs other then EU using the 'Katana' method ?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Only dollar pairs. EU, GU or AU EU is the main pair I trade, only for spread reasons.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
It doesn't matter too much which chart you look at, they all look pretty similar on a price bar chart. Take this Gold chart... it just the same as any other chart, shows the same characteristics, price bouncing between levels, previous intraday support and resistance. Pull backs that are sold into in a down move, typical price behaviour.

Should get some sort of retracement to get a trade on this move...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Retracement starting... better play this one with some caution

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Not a deep enough retracement to signal a trade... certainly resistance was evident at the 1.3000 level however.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi M, Thanks for posting up the charts. Just wanted to ask, What would you consider a deep enough retracement when taking a trade. Since you use range bars, how many pips roughly would a valid retracement be. Dan

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Stochastic above 80 and below 20 is a deep retracement. In this instance I was hoping for a move back to around the xx25 level to coincide with previous support levels. Missing a move doesn't concern me too much. A valid retrace will always appear at some point. Where possible I'll try to post a chart before the trade happens.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
There was a signal to trade which happened after I went to sleep, and another signal after that one, which occured outside of NY market times, which is typically not a good time to be trading as it's what I call the dead zone.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
As you can see, quite a few opportunities to catch a trade on this Gold chart, when the market trends, that's when you make money.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
AU looks set to make a move this session.. was a pull back continuation signal. Definitely worth watching this chart...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
when the market trends, that's when you make money... price moved xx00 to xx50 levels... this is how price moves..

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Sometimes the problem with trying to trail a position and capture a bigger move, invariably prices retrace right back to the entry... which is why taking profits at the xx00 and xx50 levels is a very good idea... AU and EU charts both showing retracements against the trend... Resistance evident at these levels is a good sign of continuaiton..

--- 帖子 #225 ---
From profit to loss.... from xx50 to xx00 level in the market...yes it's painful to have this happen...

--- 帖子 #226 ---
This sort of momentum of price does not generally stop and reverse easily... Selling around here could well be a very good idea on EU

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Attempting to approximate Katana chart setup since found the price bars script has been disabled - that is, once you download it it doesn't open. This is Renko which is a kind of price bar. Renko is set for 100 on the M1 chart. (to get 10-pip bars on brokers with 5 places after the decimal point.) The ema's are set for 20, 40 &amp; 60, which might be too narrow. Of course this (the trades) is exactly the kind of thing you want to avoid, and can always hope that Katana will be the answer rather than just acccept fact of hopelessness after about four years now of demo-ing, though have gotten somewhere lately by checking longer timeframes first, if can remember. What you see is not an active attempt to use the martingale method. That's just the way it came out. Have at least learned intellectually that the way to trade is to follow the trend, not attempt to predict it or expect it to meet expectations, and am hopeful Katana will have a positive effect in this regard. Mushashi has certainly mentioned enough times that this is the way it's done. He is obviously an accomplished trader and teacher. Believe from reading the thread that checking several thing, like S &amp; R, trendline, Highs &amp; Lows, as he does, before jumping into a trade, is the way to proceed. Now if only could learn to do this. But having expressed this wish, go directly and enter something without remembering any of it! And ever again.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
If you want to use Renko, then use this file to make the Renko Blocks. I would not recommend using them, at the very least use them with the wicks enabled. The Renko Blocks do not give a true representation of price, unlike the Range Bars.

I have been following your threads from page.1 really interesting to read on, but i have to ask questions else i couldn't not follow up. Hi Mr M. do you mean lower low = short / Higher high = long? How do we see the color histogram? green = bullish blue = retrench red = bearish white = ? how can stochastic show's the two of the main signal? reversal sign / trending? im sorry if i got you confused. please correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
lol... I was wondering what you were thinking about with that position right about now... there was a huge doji on the 5 minute two three candles ago, I thought that might turn it around for you, but instead it just wants to bounce around... ohhh... heree it goes maybe.... edit: oops, i guess not..

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Appears that GU was the pair to trade and not euro.... might be a delayed move here for EU... can only hope so.. Unusual to see GU move so much and the other pairs not even move a bit..

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Probably a good idea to exit this trade with a small loss, seems that a possible Higher Swing Low has formed, giving reason to think about early exit. Nothing worse than being stuck in a trade going no where fast...

--- 帖子 #235 ---
The trend continues in the original direction... only just...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
What a jumbled mess... could just open random trades in this and close out when you see a few pips profit.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Jumbled mess to some... trading platform to me..

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Do you call this a jumbled mess as well? This is how you can make money...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Sir... I was in no way talking about your template or strategy or setup. In fact, I have a very similar one I use as for trend following as well. I meant the Eur/Usd market itself.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Moved stop down, just in case of a big move about to happen on euro

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Ah i see, yes when market goes sideways it is a mess, but the market does not go sideways forever, which is the beauty of range bars, shows symmetrical moves very well, unlike those time based bars... that's what i call a jumbled mess... it hurts my eyes to look at time based charts now..

--- 帖子 #242 ---
lol... yes I was referring to my 5 minute chart I have sitting here in front of me. Its like someone learning to drive a manual transmission car for the first time.... start to go, but oops, released the clutch to quick and the car shutters to a stop. I really liked your idea about just turning stochastics into histograms so I did that (I had actually already done this with CCI and RSI for my 1 tick chart). But it certainly cleaned up my 1 minute chart instead of 5 different stochastic lines in one indicator panel....

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Now watch the market move another 50 pips after it hits my trailing stop..

--- 帖子 #244 ---
5 minute outside reversal bar

--- 帖子 #245 ---
If I was you, and anybody else for that fact, I would get a range bar script and run it, and sit and watch how price moves using these bars for a few weeks. Do not trade using them, just watch them and watch them around key levels of price... Then after you've done that for a few weeks, go back and watch the 5min charts again..... then see what happens..

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Forget this way of thinking my friend, you will be better off... inside bars, outside bars, doji mean nothing on range bars.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
When you look at inside bars on a chart, basically all you are doing is looking at a range after a move in one direction, for example on a H4 chart you have a down bar, then an inside bar forms, basically this is just a ranging period of price after a move down. Why limit yourself to time based bars....it makes no sense to think like this. You constantly switch between time frames, always concerned about the higher time frames.. because they are more important you tell yourself.. But why are they more important? support and resistance, price levels is what is important... waiting for a H4, H1, D1 bar to form and then make a decision is to me just a ludicrous notion now.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I don't trade off of them. I have them up because its what everyone else is looking at. So unfortunately, they do mean something. A doji on a 5 minute typically means price reverses, at least enough for me to scalp it on my tick chart for 3-8 pips. A bounce on the 50SMA on a 5minute chart happens all the time, enough for me to scalp 3-8 pips. And that last bar I just called lead to a 10 pip decline which I took 7 from. I know what you're saying though - I do love range charts, but I'm just accustomed to viewing it in time. And so are a majority of traders, especially those who are on the opposite side of my winning trades. So I agree, range is beautiful and smooth, but I feel for me at least, I need to see what everyone else is seeing so I can react to what I think they're going to do. I trade off a 1 or 10 tick (depending on the data feed) line chart most of the time. All my trades are taken and exited by the time a 10 range bar forms typically. But I think if I were to trade longer positions, I would definitely want to use a range bar system of some type.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I agree to some extent. However, I think its important to note what so many others are seeing as well. Not to mention, there is a great deal of validity to the things I look for on a time chart. And in no way, by the way, am I trying to say range bars are wrong or anything. I'm just saying, I'm much more accustomed to something else and have ways of using it to my advantage. My 1 tick line chart tells me way more than these stupid 1 minute candles. In fact, half the trades I make almost make no sense on a 1 minute chart at all, let alone a 5 minute. But thats reversal trading. Trend following I've typically stuck with a 1 minute, but maybe I'll try a 3 range or something EDIT: 4 range with a Gann HiLo... when price breaks through the 250 and 50 emas, wait for a retracement that stays under the 50, then trade the gann cross in the direction of the emas. And sorry, that's it from me... thanks for the suggestion though, I might fiddle around with this a bit more.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
what is this Gann HiLo indicator, do you mind posting it here so I can observe it on a chart please.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Ninjatrader or MT4; I have both? If ninjatrader, I won't post here, but I'll email it to you if you PM me your email.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Mushashi, Here you go.., both on chart and histo version. hope this helps. Hi jmflukeiii, do you use the standard settings of Gann Hi-Lo or is there any other

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Thank you, I will observe it on a chart, I am always looking for better methods to exit trades, so far the best method I use is to exit based on price levels, and move stops in direction of the trade using these price levels as the support/resistance levels.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Yes it seems to be useful for entries, it is picking up trend continuation entries pretty well, I will do some visual testing using this indicator to see if I can incorporate it into trading plan. Any method that will help keep you out of the market when it is ranging very helpful.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I use a 5 period Gann on a 15 tick (or 150 tick for my IB feed) chart. I've yet to master it, but its there to try to help me stay in my reversal scalps off the 1 tick ( 10 tick for my IB feed) chart. I really think it works best when not on time based charts - for awhile I used it on a renko chart where I would trade only the gann crosses in the direction of the 50 EMA on 3 or 5 pip Renko chart. Or like I just posted, it seems to be great on a range chart.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
That is enough trading for today. Moving my stop down on that EU trade cost me... however it pays to move the stop down in the direction of the trade.... although sometimes it will be of benefit other times it will not... Equity

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Gann HiLo Activator showing similar results compared to the stochastics. Market really trending well now...

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thanks Musashi, will try this, and continue looking for Range Bars. Outcome was not favorable last nite. It looks easy to follow the rules re. the three ma's. Will have to try this but takes some patience. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Obtaining range bars is easy, just google search and you'll find the link to the mql service where you can obtain it. http://www.google.com.au/#sclient=ps...w=1416&amp;bih=810

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Just checked the chart from overnight session for me, I can identify one possible trade which if traded would of been a loss trade, after that the trend filter would of prevented any further trading.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Mushashi..., Do you think AU is giving trading opportunities?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Trend filter is saying yes to start looking for long trades, just need a sufficient pull back and then a continuation signal. So not at the moment, no sufficient pull back has occured.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Pulling back nicely...

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I'm watching EJ at the moment... seems that it's possible a pull back continuaiton is about to happen.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Short trade entered on EJ...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Reached the xx25 level, price is likely to react at this level somewhat..

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Mushashi, just wondering on the EJ chart that u'd posted.., was this the 1st entry that was traded or r there some others also previous to this (just trying to understand the retracements as you see them)

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Did Nova code stop giving away their range bar script?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
yes they did. Long time ago as I remember Peter

--- 帖子 #270 ---
This is the first time I've traded this pair using this strategy, as I see it the retracement has found resistance and it's likely to end. Of course I have no way to know for sure which way price will go... as long as you trade with the trend that is what will help put the probabilities in your favour.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
they didn't, but buy one instead I guess.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
One good thing about price bars, when you get a bar with an upper wick... it's a good sign that prices could potentially go down, especially if this bar forms at a key price level, like the xx50 xx00 levels..

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Slow going... almost there...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Just over 20 pips.. happy with that.... +2.5% increase to equity.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I see you're using the gann! How's that working out for you?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yes it works for me...

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Just on the chart for the moment.... still trying to figure out if it's worth using or not..

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I have the same feeling. Generally I'm trying to use it to hold me in trades longer once already in them, not so much as an entry signal itself. As per your advice (sort of), I've also been running an identical setup 1 range chart next to my 1 tick chart tonight. Really liking the look of it. Its much smoother. And my custom indicators I made specifically for my tick chart seem to be "working" more precisely on the range chart.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Nothing to trade on EU, trend filter preventing any trading, as you can see market is range bound... trend filter doing its job...

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Same for GU, no trading as trend filter is not in agreement.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
No such problem on EJ, trending nicely, notice how price today has bounced between xx50, xx25 and xx00...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
It is not an issue to post links to free things. They are a scam, as confirmed by Forex Peace Army and many other internet postings, and are distributing it illegally, from a Post Office address in Italy, so are hard to track down, again typical of a scam. They did not create the script, as can be confirmed by going to mqlservice.com and finding their shop, where the source code is also available. Anyone distributing this is complicit in an illegal activity. Anyone thinking that it's okay to take it for free because it's only an issue for the copyright holder and not for the consumer is morally bankrupt. As responsible, self-respecting traders we are all under a moral obligation to appreciate the work carried out by our fellow traders and coders, much of which is given away free on FF and other forums. By the same token, we are obliged to pay for material provided for a fee by anyone who makes his living from assisting us in trading profitably. I believe that Michal has produced a valuable tool which is clearly better than any free range bar indie and which, coupled with range bar strategies like Musashi's, can make many FF members into profitable traders.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I have been watching this AU for most of the session, as you can see it's in trending mode, and has supplied two potential trading opportunities after pull backs where identified, however I didn't trade this pair today.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Here is a picture off my try to build this setup. instead off 3 indis to show trend, I just have 1 Red= down Green= up Yellow= no trend then I will also see if Gann hi/lo can help Peter

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Looks good mate, nice work.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
GU started a trend now... just waiting for a valid retracement to be signalled before looking to enter this one long..

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi I took a small trade long on the break off res. area. I know the retracemant was not huge, but anyway took the chance. Peter

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Yes the problem sometimes when waiting for a retracement, none is coming.... In a strong trend, buying the breaks of resistance levels is a valid strategy.. I have learned patience now and I know a retracement will happen at some point so I wait..

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Looking at the EJ chart it's possible a short continuation setup could be setting up right now..

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Normally I don't trade this late on a Friday, but I couldn't help it with this excellent setup.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Nice work, looking at the EJ chart a perfect continuation setup and plenty of room to make money, this move occured after I went to bed.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thanks. I only really trade EU. There's been lots of movement this late friday session. I'm not a huge fan of buying the breakouts as was mentioned earlier. In fact 95% of the time I'm trading the opposite direction on any potential breakouts. By the way, are all your trend filters stochastics? I use CCI for pretty much everything so that's what mine are. I just edited them so that at a certain threshold they change color again to indicate potential end of trend reversal (which actually the only thing I use them for on my other charts)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Considering the low liquidity levels, the market has given us some good moves these last two days. As you can see the combination of moving averages and stochastics is of great benefit in keeping you out of trades when the market is in congestion, and does a good job when the market trends. It's the congestion areas on the chart that you want to look at and study for reason not to trade. edit : Yes I'm only using stochastics, CCI and RSI and all the other oscillators basically give the same information. It's totally up to you what indicators you use. As long as you use something to determine trend, and whatever you do, trade with the trend... it increases the probability of a successful trade greatly.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I trade those, but much differently. I love reversing throughout congestion areas and at peaks throughout the trend. I'm going to have this chart up also to give me another perspective and another option for trading with the longer trend, maybe get a few 20 or 30 pip trades instead of 15 1-5 pip trades. Anyway, here's a couple charts with my CCI exit strategy. Not trying to change anything, just food for thought. I didn't trade these, just going back over the past day and half.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
EU chart, as you can see the trend filters did a good job of preventing any trades, once a trend was identified, and a pull back occured prices went below the moving averages, typical of what happens in a ranging market, hence the reason why no trade is signalled.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Happy New Year everyone, doubt it's worth trading today. The whole world is on holidays !!!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
The only pair I would consider trading if I did trade, it would be EJ...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
That's a sell signal on EJ right here... not recommended to trade today though...

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Price reached xx50 level...

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Sent you a PM. Peter

--- 帖子 #301 ---
EJ provided another pull back to the xx75 level and gave another signal to trade, which potentially could of made money...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Of the dollar pairs, AU showing the most potential as far as defined trend in place.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
EU technically meets the criteria for a pull back against the trend, as indicated by the moving averages pointing down.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Price is above the moving averages, so no trade signal can be generated to the short side..

--- 帖子 #305 ---
AU trending well.... just waiting for a pull back against the trend..

--- 帖子 #306 ---
EJ showing a pull back against the trend....

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Gold Chart... as you can see the pull backs and then the continuations, I've not traded Gold using this strategy before, and I've been watching it these last couple of weeks, and it seems like a candidate for this strategy as it tends to trend well. The spread is a bit of a worry however...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Some resistance evident on EJ, a bearish bar closing here would trigger a sell signal....

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Nope it closed bullish...

--- 帖子 #310 ---
What is the timeframe you preferred for?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
"Time" Did you read this thread ?? No time.... only price... EU gave a good signal for a long which would of paid... AU gave no pull back signals until now... GU gave some signals but the chart was just a mess... price was gapping alot... low liquidity...

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi all so far today I have had 3 long signals in EU. Peter

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Nothing setting up so far for this session... sit back and relax

--- 帖子 #314 ---
fratelli can you post your ind and temp plz

--- 帖子 #315 ---
GU is showing some bullish movement... not a signal yet... but you could certainly get long for sure based on price alone...

--- 帖子 #316 ---
hey Musashi looks like we can see a short entry in GU very soon

--- 帖子 #317 ---
what do you think?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Only looking for short when the moving averages are in the correct order. Then only if there's a pull back, and only if this pull back has a continuation signal, and only if this signal occurs if price is above or below the moving averages, and they are in the correct order, otherwise ignore any continuation signals. This is how you will stay out of the market when it is ranging sideways... well at least most of the time..

--- 帖子 #319 ---
There was nothing to trade on EU today using this strategy...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Here is my cable chart. not any setup yet, but maybee shortly. Peter

--- 帖子 #321 ---
EJ starting to move again... you can see how filters help prevent trading when prices are consolidating.. Just need to wait for a pull back of some sort to enter...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
EU showing signs of trending... waiting for a pull back here as well

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Just about ready for a short on GU, if this bar closes bearish.... seems to be some bidding going on around this xx00 level however...

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Price moved above the moving averages.. no short traded signalled...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Entered short after a pull back was identified, target area was the next xx00 price level... however, I exited just as price hit the xx25 region for just under 1:1 trade.. roughly +2% increase to equity. EU pushing the extreme for the Average Daily Range.. Seems like a good chance it's going to go to the next price level... no matter...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Price retraced again, stopped at the xx00 level and retraced right back to the xx50 leve. Presented a continuation signal, however the bar which caused the signal is above the moving averages, so technically it is to be ignored. However saying that... price looks set to go lower still..

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I didn't trade this... however there was enough room to make a profit...

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi Mushshi I have read the entire thread a couple of times now and am really interested in it. I have even spent some money and bought a range bar script that works really good on mt4. Thank you for presenting your method to everyone here. The main problem I'm having with following this thread is understanding what's quoted above. I am understanding that you use stochastics for confirming the trend as well as defining the pullback. I like that and there is an old thread here (hope you don't mind me mentioning it) called "sexy stochastics" or something like that, that did the same thing on regular time frame charts. Anyway...I guess you are using longer term stoch. to confirm trend and shorter term stochs. to define pullback? I am really not sure and I think there are alot of other folks that are not sure either. No disrespect to you but it is very difficult to follow your thread when you won't post a template or indicators. I have no earthly idea how to make a stoch. histogram or whatever it is on the bottom of your chart but I sure would like to be able to. I'm not lazy or asking for a handout here. I'm sure your a good person otherwise, you would not have started this thread but if you would post your confirming indicator for us where we can all see the same thing you are seeing in real time it would sure help! I don't want to sound demanding and surely mean no disrespect. I know it is your thread so you can direct it as you see fit. I'm just trying to improve my trading. Thanks. Mark

EJ chart showing a potential pull back against the trend taking place... can not see any other potential trades setting up on dollar pairs just yet..

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Nothing as yet on EJ... there was a signal on EU which I did not get as I was away from PC for a short time..

--- 帖子 #332 ---
GU just gave me a nice short signal... You must understand that there is more to trading than just blindly following indicators painting a paticular thing... identifying levels of price is just as important... if not more important... The most important thing is to get a good exit... moves between xx00 and xx50 are quite common expecially on pound which moves quite quickly at times... Price has retraced right to my entry as I'm typing this... which could be a pull back before another thrust lower... or could be a full blown retrace and stop me out...

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Both short on EU and GU closed.

Bit early to be trading... but that was a sell signal on EU...

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I loaded up Renko Bricks today, as you can see pull backs in a down trend are great...

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Compare to Range Bar... according to strategy, stochastics just printing a valid retracement for a setup just now.. however need a close below all the moving averages for a trade to take place... otherwise ignore it..

--- 帖子 #344 ---
and Renko....

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Nothing yet... however you can clearly see some resistance is evident here by the way price bars are froming..

--- 帖子 #346 ---
hey Musashi Where can I find the attatchment to plot the horizontal levels please?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Here you go buddy.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
There was a valid signal just now, bit later than I would of liked, however it is there and the probability of a successful trade is in my favour..

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Also on EU prices tend to move is waves of 20-25 pips, so taking profits after 20pip moves is a good idea at times... more downside is certainly expected to at least xx00.. I'm not greedy however... Renko for comparison...

Hope you are all enjoying your weekend. Just started using a twitter account, and I'm going to try to link my trading platform to this account so you can follow along with my trades. Good idea or waste of time? https://twitter.com/#!/Fx_Day_Trader

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Definitely NOT a waste of time. Knowing when you enter/exit trades in real time would be a huge benefit to those of us learning your method of trading. Appreciate all the help your giving us newbies mate Just created an account myself so I can follow along. Username is dan89fx Cheers Dan P.s. Just a thought, have you considered/looked into using ForexFactory's own TradeExplorer ?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Great idea

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Actually just thinking about it, twitter seems the better choice as its better suited for real time updates. TradeExplorer is good for trading records/data etc.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Twitter, does that mean we have lost you here?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I doubt it mate, Im sure M will still be posting here aswel from time to time

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Not going anywhere. Take a look at this chart of yesterday on EU. As you can see the market is trending sideways. There's a pull back at the beginning of the day, and price pulls right back up above the moving averages, and not one short continuation signal. For the rest of the trading day, there's not one signal to trade a pull back, and then the continuation. This is exactly the sort of thing I've designed this strategy to do. Keep me out of the market most times when it's trading sideways, and provide ample trading oppotunities when it's trending up or down.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
As you can see, I took a trade on AU yesterday, which was a losing trade, at the time of the trade I was looking at the bar and I was thinking that once this bearish bar closed it would print a red continuation signal. So at the close of the bar I entered the order, however I checked after and realised that a red short continuaiton signal had in fact not printed, by that time it was too late. The lesson is, always check and ensure that the criteria for a trade is met.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
AU and EU and GU showing potential trading opportunities at the moment, now just waiting for continuation signals..

--- 帖子 #366 ---
EU broken past the moving averages, now cannot get a long signal here.. GU likely to do the same... AU looking like the best prospect at this point..

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Ok I got a long signal for AU, Stops set at 1.0273 and Take Profits at 1.0345

--- 帖子 #368 ---
As you can see, EU retraced to far to make any valid signals, however you can see how price has moved between the xx00 and xx50, prices will do this often, and once reaching these areas support can be found.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Full measured move based on intraday swing... this is the reason for target area, and the reason why the stop loss is beneath that swing point at the xx75 level.. Nothing is certain...

Moved up again...

Well I'm sure I wont be posting every trade I make... I sure hope that this is helping...

--- 帖子 #375 ---
You should follow M on twitter aswell. Great for quick realtime updates.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Sure is,I am not taking the trades, i just like to follow your postings....... I am still trying to find a method that suits me,this could be it, who knows? thanks M

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Good morning Musashi. I have read your posts with great interest, not only in this thread but also in Vantage's thread (and Medici's?). As a consequence, I have done something I swore I would never do, and have signed up for Twitter! Looking forward to following you. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I'm new to Twitter as well, I think that it's possible to receive alerts to mobile phones using Twitter, which might be helpful to some who follow and want to make money. I know it's difficult to believe that there's profitable traders in this world but they do indeed exist... trust me..

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Yeah you can get the twitter app on your iphone/smartphone and have the updates/tweets on your phone. https://twitter.com/#!/download

--- 帖子 #380 ---
hey M, what format do your tweets take, if you dont mind ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Looks like this...

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks M, thats nice size trading...........Whats your background?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
This is my first post read through and lot of good info thanks M

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Definitely helping mate. Will you be posting all your trades up on twitter ?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
My trading platform is linked to twitter now... so yes all my trades will be posted there.

M......... how can I validate your trade (or not) we I can't duplicate your chart. That's what really weird about this thread. As far as I know, nobody can match or use your indicators. Your retracement into a trend strategy is one I use every day in my own way, along with Vantage's HL/LH strategy. But I can't comment on your chart, because I havn't a clue what your MA's are or what the indicators below the chart mean. I considered that short ,but there was no decent break of the xx50 level. That was my reason for staying out. Great thread, BTW. Cheers.

Hello! I'm new to this method, and i've not yet readed all the topic. I trade live mainly 1h price waves (don't like it, but it pays), so by now i'm not really interested in trading this strategy.. maybe in the future. This seems to be a good entry on EU (the exit was awful), or i'm wrong? the rangebars are set to 10, the MAs are 50, 100, 200 periods. If i can ask (maybe somebody already asked it, and i will read in latter topics pages): what are your MAs and stock settings Musashi?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
good analyze. .

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hey , SteMag......could you post your stochastic indicators. i have been looking for them everywhere, couldnt seem to find them. Oh and by the way.........youll never go broke taking pips....

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Valid trade setups in the NY session, however that's when I'm sleeping.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Sure, here it is! This can be a good starting point for a template: -10 points range bars -MAs for trend and sideways detection -GannHiLo Large (100) for trend direction -GannHiLo Small (5) or .00/.50 numbers for exit -Stochastic (5,3,3) for pullback detection This trade will probably be a loss, but it's ok anyway.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
You are living in which timezone? If you set up during this session, meaning you are paying for the swap which can be waited after NY ended.?

The indicators at the bottom of the chart are various Stochastics, 2 are used for trend filter, one is for trend pull back identification and one is for trend continuation. I don't want to post inputs here because this may give the impression that this is the "holy grail" but at the end of the day it's just to be used as a guide, and I encourage others to experiment with combinations and look at their own chart and identify areas on the chart where the market is going sideways and identify what will keep you out of the market and what will get you in the market when it is trending.. Trading for me should not be about just following blue or red bars on a histogram, but also looking at price levels, previous support and resistance levels, and also H/L and L/H patterns. Using the stochastic indicator to identify the pull backs is just one method, RSI can be used for similar things, and I'm sure there's many other different methods. I have losses, I have winners, the key is to ensure that the winners are on average bigger than the losses. There's no mechanical method that I know of that will give good exits. Other than using price levels, 20 - 25 pips is a good number of pips to exit. as prices retrace once they reach the xx00 xx25 xx50 xx75 level, regularly. I'm sharing a methodology here, one which is simple to follow. 1. Trend Identification (moving average, stochastic combo) 2. Trend Pull Back Identification (stochastic) 3. Trend Continuation Identification (stochastic) I hope by looking at the charts that I'm posting will give you some idea on what to look for.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
A pull back identified, but not a continuation as yet...

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi M, Could you give me your thoughts on this chart of yours below. From your chart it seems that price retraced to the MA's and that the bar marked in red rectangle closes bearish with a brown and red signal on the bottom 2 indicators. Im assuming the brown indicates a valid retracement to the upside in a downtrend and the red indicates a valid continuation. Any reason you did not take this particular trade if it is a correct setup (assuming) ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers Dan

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I was not at the PC, also I would avoid most trades between NY close and European open. Why trade when you know it's likely that the market is not going to move too much. As I've said before, trading is not just about following blue and red bars on a histogram.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Enough room to make a profit on the EU chart after a valid retracement and continuation...

--- 帖子 #411 ---
GU basically went sideways so not one chance to trade again on that pair..

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hey Musashi. question for you. What is the first indicator below the chart that is used as a filter to keep you out of trades and what settings.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Just closed EU long trade after continuation signal presented after pull back identified...

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I believe the top 3 are trend filters and the bottom 2 are pullback &amp; continuation filters. As for the settings, M has mentioned numerous times in this thread that he wont be releasing this information.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi M I was wondering what TF are u look at those pullback thks

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Its not a time framed based chart mate. Its a range bar chart. Each bar closes after a certain number of pips is completed. In other words every bar is the same number of pips and time is irrelevant Dan

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Long signal generated here.... let's see how it goes....

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Moved the TP levels up and added an auto trailing stop on this one... just in case... Market seems to be somewhat bullish

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Anyone trading this method or following M's trades on twitter ? Hows it going for you ? Dan

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Im following this system and also twitter posts. Works perfekt. easy and clear way to make money

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Musashi, mate, why didn't you tell me you had a new thread?! I haven't really been tracking anyone or following anything other than Medici and Islander's thread for a while so I had no idea. Great to see more fantastic range bar charts out of you! As you no doubt know (think I saw you lurking in Euro Morning thread) I've pretty much converted entirely to range bars myself. Still a few time-based things I hang on to but not much these days. I'll hit you up on Skype one of these days so we can talk range bars again. Last time we chatted I think I was still trying to figure out a way to implement it properly with my own trading style. Anyways, it now looks like I have some new reading material for the weekend. Looking forward to it!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yeah im following him on twitter but it seems the system is not doing so good at the moment. Quite a number of losses since trades were made live. Still following though, loosing trades will always occur

--- 帖子 #423 ---
for me its still perfect. I found my own setup and take only low risk trades

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi, I would also like to build my charts on range bars but it is not working on my MT4. Do I need to change some settings within MT4 to make it work? Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi, the rangebar script needs to go into experts folder, open an MT4 1 min chart, load the script, set the range you want (5, 6, 8, 10 pips, etc.,), set the timeframe you want like m2, m3, m4, m6 (apart from the custom mt4 periods) go to file-open offline, select the period you'd selected.., like if u'd set the rangebar script as 2 min for eur/usd, search for" eurusd, m2" and open it and that is it. hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Great description paapi. Thanks! But where do I get the rangebar script? Thanks

--- 帖子 #427 ---
You'll have to purchase one if you want a reliable rangebar script at mqlservice.net

--- 帖子 #428 ---
pm me I will send y

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Or just simply type "s-constant range bars" into google.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
I use s-constant range bars as well

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Where is Masushi? Why stopped posting? Harry

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I'm still around mate. I've been having a difficult time trading at the moment, I haven't been able to put as much screen time into trading as what I normally would like. Hence my trading is suffering somewhat. This strategy doesn't give too many opportunities to trade in a day, and if you get a loss, then you miss the next trade which is a winner... well you know what happens then. Therefore I'm about to implement a very short term trading plan, which means I'll only have to be in front of the screen for the european open. This short term trading plan involves price closing above below moving averages around the open. Using Renko on very small bars. I'm still going to monitor the 10 Pip Range Bars for opportunities as well.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Thanks Mushasi, nice to see that you are still around. I like your strategy and have been tracking since the begining. Have a nice day. Harry

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Quite simply it will be called Wakizashi Trading System, and it will be using Renko Bricks, 2 Pips in size. Two moving averages and once price closes above or below both moving averages, then trade in that direction. The direction for the trade will be short if price approaches the xx00, xx25, xx50 and xx75 levels from beneath them, and long if it approaches the xx00, xx25, xx50 and xx75 levels from above them. In this way, trade away from the xx00, xx25, xx50, xx75 levels. Exit for this strategy is going to be using the next close above the moving averages, with an initial hard fixed stop loss of 15 pips. However the exit is going to be alot less than 15 pips in most cases, this stop loss of 15 pips is there to calculate the position size, and it's a hard stop loss in case you lose power and cannot access your trading platform. Both moving averages tuning red indicating a short, and both moving averages turning blue indicating a long. Once price comes back the vicinity of the xx25 xx50 xx75 and xx00 levels. I hope this makes sense. This will be only good when trading around market open times, as we know prices will move...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Price retraced above the moving averages but closed below them, so still stay short.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Just move the stop down to a level just above the price levels, to protect captial. Keep losses small and let winners run as long as potentially possible.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Closed...

--- 帖子 #438 ---
As you can see this is the type of move aiming to capture at the opens.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi M, hows things being going with your system lately

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Things are going along ok.. one thing will always remain the same when I trade and that is price levels...

--- 帖子 #441 ---
A bearish close here and it will be a short for me...

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Closed bullish... still waiting for a bearish close...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Seems like it's not going to breakout lower at this stage... a spike above resistance and then some bearish bars will be a really good sign to look for shorts...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Yep still going along nicely.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
excellent trader's discipline. I like your money management. Keep it up bro, have been watching u

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Yes indeed, correct money management is key, and keeping risk the same regardless of stop loss location is critical to success. I've setup my trading platform using Internet Trade Mirror, which can duplicate my orders over the internet. Some will soon be benefiting from my orders.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Good morning to all Musashi compliments for operability '. From Monday I will try on the Bund with candles 10tick How are set your sma??? Thanks ...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
It matters little which moving averages you use on your chart. I am using a 30, 50 and 100 EMA on the chart.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
When the market trends you make money, when it goes sideways you typically lose money. Keeping the size of winners bigger than losers is what helps you make money.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi M, Nice to see that your still around and still trading your method. I'm still finding trading difficult at the moment. Cant seem to get many winning trades (vast majority are loosers - price going in the exact opposite direction as my entry order) I tried your Katana method but couldnt get the confrmation stochs to work out. I've been mainly following DarkWolfs method (basically S/R, RN and waiting for price to create pattern e.g. pinbar at those levels) for a while now but still unable to get positive results. Very frustrating but im keeping at it.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Stick with those price levels, look at congestion around those areas, and follow the direction of the moving averages. You'll increase your chances of a successful trade if you follow the direction of the intraday move. Wait for price to move out of a congestion area, then wait for price to come to that region, if it pauses at that level and shows some signs of price reacting to it, then you have some idea on what could potentially happen. There is no certainty in trading other than that there is no certainty. Try aiming for the next xx00 level or xx50 level and stick to entries around those areas. Forget the xx25 and xx75 levels for a bit and just concentrate on the xx00 and xx50 levels. Use the xx00 and xx50 zones for entry areas and TP areas, use the xx25 and xx75 levels as the SL areas. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
This is a picture of what I'm talking about. Patience is what is needed, and wait for something like this to setup. Profitability doesn't come from making lots of trades. Only from good R:R and good Win:Loss ratios.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I'm not saying it's easy, it's not easy. It takes training and patience. Training your eye to see price levels and not indicator levels. Once you see the market as price moving from one congestion level to the next, look for what happens at price as it comes back to previous congestion levels. If it helps then draw boxes on your chart around those areas that are most obvious to you. I do this unconciously now. I'm that used to looking at a chart with those levels on it.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I've never used range candle bars. It is a little strange for me. But I love it. Thanks to the availability ' And sorry for my english

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Also on the bund are very important those levels ... 1/4 of the point. Good idea ....

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Here's an example of an acutal trade I took using this strategy of waiting for a breakout then observing price after this happened. I don't need to know what is going to happen, just that i know prices will tend to go to the next xx00 levels once price goes past xx50 and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
One more example of an actual trade taken, you can see prices making lower highs. This is the sort of thing that you need to train your eyes to see.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Hi M, Thanks for the charts, explanations and advice. Really appreciate it, especially on the weekend when you probably got better things to do. Cheers mate Dan

--- 帖子 #459 ---
just a quick question, do you mind explaining how you determine where you entry is and/or what bar patterns you use to indentfy an entry. Cheers Dan

--- 帖子 #460 ---
It's not too scientific I'm afraid, it could be a two bar reversal, that is one bull candle followed by a bear candle for a short and the opposite for a long. It could be one candle being a reversal candle that is one with a upper or lower wick. Or it could be a series of 4 candles bull/bear/bull/bear then a sell, where the bull candles each have lower highs, this would indicate failure to break higher and giving a hint that prices could go lower. This is a typical congestion pattern which you'll see quite a bit at the top or bottom of a run, or at the beginning of a new move after a pause in the market. What is important is sticking with the direction of the intraday trend. Observing how prices have moved in the asian session and then looking for a direction to present in the european/ny sessions and then trade in that direction. Candles that give upper or lower spikes which present at previous support or resistance levels give a great sign. It's something you'll have to practice and watch the market. There's no easy answers I'm afraid. Black box systems which describe every scenario just don't exist, you could try Nial Fuller's Price Action course. This might help you. Also I don't know if you've heard of a guy named Hector Deville, watch some of his old vidoes on youtube. How he talks about dynamic areas of support/resistance and areas of confluence. I've learned alot about price and price action from watching his videos in the past. Here's a link to some of them www.youtube.com/user/Yaguex http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...g&amp;feature=plcp

Going along nicely still.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Nice !

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Nice shooting Musashi ! This sort of flies in the face of those on this forum tooting 80-90% wins. As shown profitability is solely not about a methods winning %. but everything to do with R/R%...keeping losses small and wins larger. Well done Cheers Bluesteele

--- 帖子 #441 ---
You know what the most difficult thing is? It's taking those run of losses in a row and then the self doubt kicks in, however knowing that all it takes is one or two trades at r:r 1:2 and 1:3 to wipe out a run of losses keeps you going. Self Discipline to stick to your exit and to move your stop in the direction of the trade is what is needed to achieve those higher r:r wins. The market might range more than it trends, but when it trends, that's when you make money. Simple as that.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Identification of a possible trend is one of the most important aspects to any trading plan. We can anticipate the beginning of a trend by looking for congestion in the market, this can be seen on any time frame or on any price bar chart. Typically once price moves outside of a congestion area, it will move/trend to the next congestion area. This is basically how the market moves. It moves from one congestion level to the next. Identification of a pull back against the trend and then the subsequent continuation of the trend is one of the most difficult things to do. Look for factors that might indicate this could be the end of a pull back. Such factors to me are, 1. Price reaches a previous intraday support or resistance level, previous end of day support or resistance level. 2. Price reaches a xx25 xx50 xx75 xx00 level. 3. Price comes back to a 50% fibonacci ratio level ( 50% fib level in a trending environment will quite often signal the beginning of another wave in the trend ). 4. Stochastic indicator is indicating a level where price has pulled back enough to consider the end of a move is about to occur. 5. Price is above / below all the moving averages. Those are the main factors to me that will indicate a potential area on the chart where price may continue in the direction of the trend. This is but one strategy to use to trade the market. There are indeed others, such as breakouts out of a congestion areas, price pattern recognition, new daily lows, new daily highs and so on and so on.

Hi Musashi, ...Oi Oi Oi....... thanks for making time to share your strategy in this thread of yours. I just found it last night and still reading through the pages. The way I trade is quite similar with yours. My question is, do you only see chart setups in 1 timeframe only? and do you pull your fibs on daily hi n low or on the very last trend movement ? i'm gonna continue my reading cheers mate...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
i got carried away and forgot it's range bar.. the fib question remains...

err..has this thread move to somewhere else ? anyways, i'll just post and hope a samurai in here would share his thoughts http://i50.tinypic.com/4qq45l.gif This is EU chart today which happened couple minutes ago. This is a chart setup that i usually enter. Price retrace from A and open position on breakout at B. Would any of you enter earlier ? if yes, what's the reason on your entry ? If not, why ? I'm following M on twitter but he didn't trade this one.

Is anyone still trading range bars and found it profitable compared to time-based charts?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
just recently looked at price change bars. didnt understand them until now. esignal memeber so it is easy to load these charts, but they only supply about 21 days of historical data to back test strategy, but at a 10 price change bar setting, that is thousands of bars. looks more like normal candlesticks than range bars, which i have been using and feel that they give a better look at trend than time based bars. range bars do not present a visual of the consolidation of prices like price change bars do. a range bar might only print one bar over a two or three, four or longer hour time frame, depending on the activity. the price change bar does present a great visual of prices meandering around a small price area with many price changes, back and forth, until the required number of price changes has taken place. a 10p chart might print an hour of prices going back and forth around a few pips, showing the quiet before the movement in a new trend, (i do like to trade very small time frames, but i spend hours watching the markets). a range bar might show one bar with an open at the low and close at the high for a 10 pip range and take more than an hour to do so. a 10P price change bar would show several candles in the same time period with the price bouncing up a few pips and down a few pips, clearly an inactive market or simply consolidation around a price level. it is fascinating to compare a 5 minute chart to a 10P chart. an engulfing candle in a 5 minute chart might look like an orderly trend upwards on a 10P chart, with many candles formed with pullbacks (flags and pennants) to give opportunities to enter for 10 or more pip gains, or losses if it goes against the short term trend. incase you are curious, esignal costs me 190 each month, usd, and i dont have an indicator for the trading vehicle most people use with the free charts. possibly there is an indicator out there for that, but i dont have one.

--- 帖子 #449 ---

--- 帖子 #450 ---
trading vehicle... i was referring to a program such as metatrader. depending on your broker, some brokers use their own trading platform and some use metatrader. my error was in referring to it as a vehicle instead of a trading platform. a price change bar is a candlestick that uses a preset number of times a currency pair changes their price instead of posting after a set number of minutes or a set range of pips. in a 10P price chane bar, if a currency goes up one pip then down one pip, and does this 5 times, then price has changed 10 times yet it has only traveled two pips, one up, one down. a candle stick will post that has a range of two pips. some charts i look at have a 500P price change bar, which would indicate that prices change 500 times. that might mean that it fluctuates up or down a few pips, yet price changed 500 times. if this posts a doji, possibly a shooting star doji, then this is a good indication of a top of a swing since the price changed 500 times, yet opens and closes on the same price. an engulfing bar of 500P, would indicate that prices have consistently gone up for 500 price changes and open and closed at the extremes. price change bars have no relationship to time, since prices might take hours to change in a slow time, and have no relationship to range, since prices can fluctuate back and forth in a small range for a long time. one aspect of price change bars is that they seem to draw boxes and pennants much clearer than time charts and range charts, and range charts really dont draw flags and pennants well at all. other indicators, which i dont use, look clearer. moving averages seem smoother than time charts. esignal web site has a brief explanation of these bars.

By "gapless", I meant the gap between the previous bar and the next bar. On MT4 indicator/EA , there is always this 1pip gap. But for TradeStation chart, there is no gap between each candle. Thanks for the link, I will search for the gapless range bar EA there.
