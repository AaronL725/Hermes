[TDT] Reich System: Welcome ForexFactorianors, Reich System (Reich is German and means Rich) is a System build on the experience I have gathered through my over 6Years of Trading, that includes the Wisdom shared on ForexFactory and on other various Sites. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ How to use this System: I primarily Swing Trade Forex so I personally focus on the 4Hour and Daily Timeframe Chart. At first you might get overwhelmed looking at the Screenshot and the amount of indicators you see on the Chart, but dont worry. All of my Indicators are working in tandem. Meaning they synergise with each other, but are still different enough to filter bad trades out. Entry Continuation: First we have to understand the Trend direction. The Subwindow, Candle colour and the MA's help you with that. MA`s must have both the same colour The Subwindow must have same colour as desired direction Spike indicator is not allowed to show coloured spikes in your desired direction VMA Candle Colour must be same colour as desired direction Enter on Arrow Signal if everything agrees! Entry Reversal: The Spike Indicator must show a coloured spike The RSI (subwindow) must change colour The VMA Candle must change colour Enter on Arrow Signal! Entry Breakout: If you pay attention you see the VMA Candle changing to a Line, this is the Market pausing. This is the time you want to look for a breakout Candle, meaning VMA changing from a Line to a Candle. MA`s must have both the same colour The Subwindow must have same colour as desired direction Spike indicator is not allowed to show coloured spikes in your desired direction VMA Candle Colour must be same colour as desired direction Arrow Signal in desired direction Enter when VMA line turns to Candle! Exit: Here we have several Options, there isnt a best or worst. It solely depends on your personality and how long you like it stay in a trade Exit when the faster MA changes colour Exit when VMA changes to a line Exit when fast RSI changed colour Exit on Spike indicator coloured spike Exit on VMA Candle Colour change Exit on Donchian Channel ___________________________________________________________ Basic Explaination what you see on the Chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entry Continuation Example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entry Reversal Example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entry Breakout Example: Attached Image (click to enlarge) ________________________________________________________________ Indicator &amp; Template: Please put the folder, NOT just indicators inside the MT4 -&gt; Indicator folder Attached File(s) Reich System Ind&amp;TPL.rar 2.3 MB | 2,740 downloads Small Update for People that might have lag problems: Attached File(s) Reich System Ind&amp;TPLagfix.rar 2.3 MB | 2,146 downloads UPDATE TDT REICH SYSTEM EVO 11.10.2022 Attached File(s) Reich System EVO Ind&amp;TPL.rar 2.3 MB | 1,864 downloads | Uploaded Oct 11, 2022 5:44pm UPDATE TDT REICH SYSTEM EVO 17.10.2022 CPU Usage finally fixed !

so far everything is ok, the system hangs from time to time. The entry is identical to what I'm dealing with. my computer is not slow,

Thanks for letting me know, its working fine on my PC but it might be the Arzz indicator, I will check it out when I am home.

Hi, TDT.Coffe. Thanks to share trading method. In this picture, please tell detail reason of NO Trade. Best regards. thanks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
As a Continuation Trade it is not valid as the subwindow big line (DSL OBV) is not red. But as a R eversal Setup it is a valid Trade to taken. The RSI (thinner line in subwindow) is red . Why to make this difference between continuation and reversal trade here might not seem obvious, but you will take notice it when Trading this System for some time. It is important to differentiate though between a Contuination and Reversal setup, as you need to know the risk involved taking a Reversal. Hope it clears it up. Cheers.

Study Chart Pause Examples: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Market naturally needs to take "breaks" or "pauses" to refill their tanks or to make decisions where to go from here. If you pay attention the chart shared above, you will notice that the Market either continues its current Path or reverses . Thanks to the VMA line changing to a VMA Candle we can to a good degree understand whether the Market wants to continue or reverse after that Pause. Which is our breakout setup . The important thing you need to remind yourself of, is that the Marking was and might still be in " slow mode " meaning there is thin volume in the Market and the trade idea might fail because of that. Here is the same Chart with another Example Pay attention how the thin line is changing colours at times and how even after a breakout VMA Candle the Market still doesn't move from its Place. When the thin line changes its colours back and forth its a strong sign that we are in a bigger consolidation. Meaning the Market environment has changed from a short pause to a larger range as it currently isnt sure what to do ( you may call it also equilibrium). You may have taken the intial breakout Trade to the short side and took either a full or small loss. Thats Trading. You can't win all. You should take note though how the Market immediately goes into a Pause mode again (VMA line). Thats another indication that you do not want to take another Trade till you get a clearer Picture of what the Market wants to do. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

That was fast !!! Thank you. Its an interesting system

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Are there results for the system?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I have results, that's why I have shared the system here and put time into explaining it (hint: results are good). There is no point in sharing my results though, my positive results won't mean you or any other person will be able to replicate that. If you are interested in the system then try it out and figure it out yourself whether the system is something for you or not.

Hi TDT, Why not try something really "Radical" and just follow Price When Price Stops making New Highs/Lows look for a Break of Structure

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Stevepatt, Thanks for your hindsight... I mean price action chart. If that's what you like to trade and are profitable with it. AWESOME!! There are many ways to trade, many ways to make money and even more ways to lose money. Whether you use Price Action or a System based on Indicators, profitability comes from the Person that is sitting behind the Monitor and presses buy or sell. Trading is a Mental Game and never has been anything else. Indicator based Systems can give you the benefits of eliminating a part of discretion being used and also opens up an easy way to take consistently the same Entries over and over again. I also dont need to spend a lot of time on the Charts. I wait for an alarm on my phone and then I quickly check whether the Signal is valid or not and then move on with my life, either Scalping the Session opens on Indices or spending time with my wife. If you enjoy your Price Action that's great, but I suggest moving to another Thread to post that type of Charts (there are more than enough on this website) Cheers. Edit: In your Status it says "never stop learning" maybe you try to open up your mind and try things out once in a while!

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank you so much for sharing this awesome trading tools....I decided to trade it on the 4 hours and I am seeing great deal of results and I believe it would make more positive results in the future. Thank you once again!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hello All Thanks for sharing ,I have one question about the signals of the indicatores ..are the signal repaint it self ,and if yes which indecator and what do you suggest to do with this case

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi TDT, I've seen so many Indicator Based Systems, not to mention Price Action Based Systems being Posted and the majority of the time, if you are lucky, the person starting the thread and a few lucky Subscribers who persevere might make it work for them. What I have highlighted in Blue makes sense, the most important atribute to accuire as a Trader is "Independent Thinking" without it you are doomed to Fail. Anyway, I would recommend when Indicators become unclear that some attention to Price might be a Benefit. All the best in your pursuits

--- 帖子 #21 ---
That's the reason why most Trader fail, they give up and move on to another thing again. Agreed. Totally! I have deleted most discretion with the System, but more experienced Traders can of course turn on the normal Candlesticks and use Price Action as confluence. There is a reason why there are buttons for the on Chart indicators and why I havent disabled Candlesticks completely (turned off their colour) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, Thanks a lot for sharing this great gift I regret that I don't know which indicator considerably slows down the display on my PC ! Another new PC ? ... Where do you put the stop-loss at the start please ? And how do you move it after ? Sorry for my poor english Merci beaucoup Santé jf

Risk Management: Sadly this is something I can hardly put into a rule as every individual has a different way of Trading. Start by putting your SL above the Recent High/Low Put your Trade to breakeven once your Trade hits ADR pips. GU has for example an ADR of 314 Pips currently. Once your Trade hits that said 314pips from your Entry point, then move your Trade to breakeven. From there on you Trail each VMA Candle till your Target Point. In soon future I will elaborate and show it more detailed. I repeat myself here though, keep in mind everyone needs to find their way of Managing their Risk, as every Person Traders and prefers different ways of Trading. Edit: go to your MT4 -&gt; Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Charts - Now reduce both Max Bars to 5.000 (or lower) This might help with your lag issues. Also make sure you downloaded the "fixupdate" Template

Thanks jf

it looks very efectiv and interesting, i m happy that you shared this solutions. I will want testing today, when market is closed. Indicators repainted ?

The wavy symbol and the spike indicator repaint somewhat. But keep in mind both of those indicator are there as a warning sign for potential reversal signals.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hello Dear, Can u pls clear 3 and 4 condition a bit?? I am confused here: 3. Spike indicator is not allowed to show coloured spikes in your desired direction 4. VMA Candle Colour must be same colour as desired direction Here which one is Spike indicator and which one is VMA candle pls ?? and also explain a bit condition 3 and 4 .. This 2 condition and indicator a bit confusing for me .. pls help.

I will share charts that look interesting to me, but I likely wont share my live entries. I have a private discord for that. Before anyone asks, I won't share it here as I dont want to promote anything in this thread, hope you understand.

sure, i respect your view, maybe a few trades for example ,in the early stage of learning, this will be very helpful. After, think that every reliable users , will be ready on the start alone.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
and what , signal arrow was early, now you want join to trend, but i think that you need next arrow signal ? As a described by the author.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
You are correct! I recommend Trading the breakouts only with a recent Arrow Signal. If you take note of the RSI we are getting into oversold territory, this doesnt mean we need to exit a Trade. Not at all. It just might mean the Trend is getting overextented and trading a breakout without any significant pullback (as seen that we dont have a new arrow) lowers the probability of winning the Trade. Please remember that's just my Observation trading this System that I have created. I am sharing my View, this is all.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
ok, this is possible ? like in tihs example, arrow was last trading day, can i look for open position in after time, during europa session ? Or in your opinion, better option for trading is only after directly arrow.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
For me its only directly after an Arrow, essentially as a Rule.. you want an Arrow to appear when its a VMA line and then you trade the breakout once it forms the actual VMA Candle

--- 帖子 #40 ---
This Trade setup looks promising to me... wht u think bro?? It met all condition as i think

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Love the system. Whats your opinion on using this for scalping.Testing it out on the live market but missed few trades because my system keeps hanging. Are there similar indicators on trading view ?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Was this (purple line) a valid reversal entry? Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes, this would have been a valid Reversal Setup . Always keep in mind that Reversal setups are the most difficult to trade. I personally try only to take reversals if the Pair is near AWR or AMR.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I don't understand why in the case of reversal entry the VMA Candle must change colour. In your example below, the reversal entry will be a Sell, no? If so, why we need a green VMA candle? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
You understood it wrong. in the example shown we are in an UPTREND which means the VMA Candle is GREEN, so the VMA Candle has to change to RED

--- 帖子 #46 ---
All right, we are in an uptrend, so in the case of reversal entry we will look for a Sell. The sell trade correspond by your red vertical line into your chart example (if the VMA candle is red also), it's correct? Is it a right reversal set up in this chart below? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
There are no spikes, both subwindow lines show in the desired direction, this is not a reveral setup, but a continuation setup! Please keep in mind that today is a Bank holiday for US,CAD and JPY. I personally wouldnt trade on such a Day.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Ok thank you, I'm still learning your system And on this new example below, is it a right reversal set up (we open a sell trade on vertical blue line)? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Correct! Good job, that's a breakout + reversal setup

Hi TDT, I have a question in regard to Swing Trading. When Swing Trading H4 D1 I assume you look at multiple Charts. In the past I have tried to Swing Trade but I have found, at times, Several Pairs will Set Up at the same time. It can be difficult to decide which Pair to Trade, unless you are lucky enough to have a big enough Account to Trade several Pairs at the same time. For Example if the USD is Strong against several Crosses, at the same time, how do you decide on which Pair(s) to Trade and which to leave? I have never felt comfortable Buying the USD, or any currancy, across more than one Pair personally. I'm just interested to hear your approach to this.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Great question! First of all, I personally do NOT look at several Timeframes when swing trading. I only trade the Chart that I am currently watching. Why? Whenever I tried to add multi timeframe analysis I confuse myself. I do not want any confusion in my trading. I have enough confluences not to worry about other timeframes. About your actual question I personally use ADR,AWR and AMR to help my decision. I watch first if any Pair is closer or further away from its AWR or AMR. Lets take my GU short example. I had the option to short either EU,GU or NU NU was in the middle of its AWR. EU and GU were similar but GU was a bit closer to its AWR TO THE UPSIDE This means GU has a higher chance of making at least a pullback Now watch ADR which pair has a higher ADR EU or GU? GU had a much higher ADR in terms of Pips. Meaning it moves a lot more. To me -&gt; more movement = lower risk So I chose GU has my pair to trade. I never trade several Currency crosses, I dont like to split my risk as I see that to be very pointless and I dont want to increase my risk by trading the same currency. I wish I could give you a visual, but i am currently not at home.

Hello, Very interesting and promising trading system, thanks a lot for your hard work. Trying to learn and apply the rules, but i have a quick question please: where do we put the Stop Loss in order to calculate the Position size? Again thank you very much for what you do!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Dont think too much about your stoploss. Just put it above/below the recent high and you should be good.

Thanks for your quick and kind reply

Thanks for posting the method. "you need to put the folder in the MT4-&gt; Indicator section, not the indicators seperately" - after I do that, do I still need to put the indicators separately in the folder anyway? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Sometime there is very big difference between price of candle and VMA as on chart below (horizontal red lines). Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is necesary to display the candles on the chart to put correctly the stop loss and to calculate correctly the lot size. Even if in this example there is no set up entry.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
When the red and green crosses appear on the chart? It is necessary to monitor the orders very regularly to see if a cross has appeared, right?

It's just one more ZigZag reincarnation - no need to monitor (or to try to backtest) it at all because it will give you new signals on every HH or LL ))

The strategy is always under development, if I get an idea I will try it out and see if it works or not. For example most people that download this system will try it out and take 2 trades, they may lose both or just one and then move on. Never thinking about how to maybe change a few things to make it suitable for their easy of trading. People are lazy and fast to give up. I am not and that's why I am still here trading. I

#LEARNING A NEW STRATEGY To learn any new strategy takes time. One of my trading coach 30 years ago told us to trade the new strategy by forward testing first with 100 trades, then the next 200 trades, then 300 trades and at each stage do an evaluation at every 100 trades closed interval and study and take notes. TDI Reich System uses many technical indicators. First, some of you being new to MT4 and face some problem with your MT4 platform. This is your first struggle and you may give up because of this. Like all new systems, I start by learning and studying each indicator on a new price chart. After you have loaded the Indicator folder correctly and able to load the template, you will see the list of indicators. Load each of the indicator onto a new chart each time and start learning.

Afternoon Ellenbrook, This is an interesting system, your entry looks really good, according to my limited knowledge of his system, but as he says some folk will download it, try it, and if it doesn't work for them, discard it. Did you see this opportunity as a Reversal or Continuation, as he states, knowledge of that is vitally important as to how the trade is managed From page 1 I see that he allows a cross to happen as an exit method, it will be interesting to see how this trade develops from here. With your years of experience would you use one of your better known rules to exit this trade or allow this to develop based on his experience, which appears to be successful. Once in a trade TDT will review his trade 4 Hrly or maybe Dly, also he does not monitor intraday moves---with your years of experience in trading, I wonder if you will allow any of those rules to be applied here. Lets see what happens, and good luck with this trade. Kind regards Ben

--- 帖子 #113 ---
All of those Trades are fine, as most of them are Reversal trades, as far as I can tell the RSI always had its colour changed, which is one of the requirements needed to take a reversal setup. Again I want to emphasize that this System can be traded almost purely mechanically, but anyone is welcome to use as much discretion as they want to increase their chance of winning. That said I of course want to still see only Trades here that make somewhat sense with the System being used.

Your review on this chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Is it a good buy set up for the red vertical line #1? Is it a good buy set up for the yellow vertical line #2 (VMA is flat)? If no, is it possible to enter buy on the second yellow vertical line #3 (because VMA is now a candle)?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Well done! I see that you are using the TDI as an additional confluence.. something I am actually playing with right now as well. The TDI is an amazing indicator, as it can be seen on a different System called TMS.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes! Good job! You are correct. Setup #1 is valid Setup #2 is not valid as we have a VMA line Setup #3 is a valid breakout setup trade

--- 帖子 #117 ---
On the set up #3 there is no green arrow, this arrow appear on the previous candle, do you valid this buy set up?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
for a Breakout Setup, you dont need the Arrow to be on a VMA Candle. the Arrow shows you the direction you want to trade the Breakout (VMA line to VMA Candle)

Thank you I did management to get it to work. I am however having great difficulty running the template. As mentioned in other comments is hangs up and moves VERY slow. I have a very fast computer.

I highly recommend not to take a Trade when the VMA is a line. Here is where you could have entered on AUD/JPY, I was actually looking at that exact same Trade, but I didnt take it. If you pay attention to the size of the VMA Candle you see that they are very small. Compare previous breakouts that worked very well.. you will notice that the breakout VMA Candle usually has a larger body.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Sorry sadly it's difficult for me to help here as I dont have any problems loading the Templates on my Charts. (MT4 can be weird) I dont know if I wrote it to you, but try to limit the historic Bars shown on your Charts through the MT4 Tools option..this might help.

@ellenbrook congratulation for your trades but be careful do not open many trades with the same currency GBP (GBPCHF, GBPJPY, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, etc...) because if the market go against your trades, you will loose all this trades. I try to open only 1 trade per currency with a maximum of 2% of risk per trade. Good luck and green pips.

also did have in the beginning problems to load the template so did use a new MT4 and then did update all currency on the daily frame than in the options max bars 20000 or 5000 . did open only one chart to avoid hanging and loaded the template. also, make sure you load the complete file on the metal trader do not download the indicators alone and load on the mt4 ok same as the template ok did experience the template will load faster on some currencies grr GBP/JPY and EURJPY very slow hang for a long time do not know why but others currency no problems. hope that will help cheers

I'm really sorry to bring this up, but I'm still having difficulty with loading the charts I've placed the folder in the indicators folder. Go to the templates and the template isn't there. So I put the template file in the templates folder. Template is there but when I apply to a chart, its a black screen with very predominantly no indicators on Do I apply the indicators separately to the template chart? I'm sorry about this, but Iam really keen to get involved but i am really struggling to get the correct chart Thank you

--- 帖子 #156 ---
So you have to put the downloaded Indicators folder inside yout MT4's Indicators folder. And then you can open the template from wherever you saved it (desktop, downloads, doesn't matter). That should work normally i think...!

Hi TDT First of all, thank you for sharing this to the FF community. I have downloaded your system and I am focusing on practising one trade type at a time. I would like to ask you if you could expand a little on your trade management style. Both when your trade is winning and when your trade is losing. I am aware that there numerous ways to do this, however I am ininterested on what has worked best for you on this system. I generally don't like to ask too many questions or clutter threads with informatoin that has already been mentioned, so if you have already discussed this, please accept my apologies, as I may have somehow missed it. Thanks in advance. Ezzy

Hi, Same thing for me. I try by removing one or more indicators. Is it one or more indicators that would be responsible? Which do you think? As it is, in these conditions, it's very difficult to play Reich for me. Thanks jf Or may be the broker's MT4 ? Mine is Global Prime ...

Welcome to our Reich System Community in FF! I personally like to have my intial SL a bit wider, by that I mean it might not be just the recent high, but maybe even a bit above it! Once the Market goes into my favour I tend to scale into my trades. Meaning I am adding to my current Trade. Before I am adding a Trade I move the SL from my first Trade lower, decreasing my Risk. The Goal while adding/scaling into Trades is usually to increase your Gain but to lower or keep your Risk the same . Once I am about 1% or more into Profits I put my trade to breakeven. I personally do NOT Trail my Stoploss, I like to give the Market more freedom. I exit when I get a cross (exit indicator) or the AMR is reached.

did have the same problems did download a new fresh ATM4 did update all currency daily then only 20.000 or 5000 candles and open only one chart will work fine but one or 2 currency slow to open but that fine .

--- 帖子 #184 ---
You cannot resolve this problem during the weekend when the market is close. Wait till when the market is open then and test one each of the indicator one at a time and observe which one is CPU intensive. I am sure the indicators with MTF function is rather COU intensive. I suspect the templates provided in Post#1 has some 'broken links' and this hangs the PC. The initial startup of MT4 profile takes very long time. Best way forward is to create your own template new from scratch. You already have all the indicators in its own Folder. What you need to do is to load each indicator one at a time and then save that as your template with its own name. Important to load only the indicators you want to use. I did this and have 12 charts open with the same own created template and CPU performance is acceptable. My own created template : Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
yes, good to have a clean MT4 installed for the testing. I have a new MT4 instance installed and with maximum bars and no problem. Then build up my chart profile with the TDI Reich indicator folder and created my own templates.

Hi TDT. Thank you for sharing this strategy. I am trying to study how works your system because I have been looking for a time an EA like yours. Usually I don't have enough time to have a look to the screen in my VPS. Do you think if it is possible to make an EA following this strategy? The idea is to automatic the strategy following the rules. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Measured indicator loading. These seem to be the indicators which extremely slow down the loading process at the very first start. Without these indicators it worked much faster, at least for me. WeekDays&amp;Holidays EURUSD,H4: initialized00:00:00,765 Levels_PLUS EURUSD,H4: initialized00:00:00,172 metaToolBox-CW EURUSD,H4: initialized00:00:00,134

--- 帖子 #194 ---
I am sure there is a way to make an EA out of it, I personally have too little programming experience though and even less in mql4/5

--- 帖子 #195 ---
How do you deal with the redrawing of the indicator, do you wait for the close of the candle or do you prefer to trade directly on the signal and then quickly exit again when it changes?

--- 帖子 #196 ---
There is no redrawing, you just have to wait for the Candle to close

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Me neither but I was thinking to pay and to compile the EA. I don't know if someone can maintain the EA because if not, it will be expensive!

--- 帖子 #198 ---

Of course the latest.

wow lovely charts Michael. It looks fantastic! As I tried to reduce the CPU usage so the majority can use it, I had to trim it down a bit. If you notice, I have put the currencies in Pairs of 3. So for example I want to trade GJ, I also pay attention to EJ and UJ and use them as confluence whether its good to take a trade here or not. The Pairs I chose are also the most liquid Pairs in Forex, which means they move the most and most consistent compared to other Pairs. hope that answers your question. Good Trading!

hi in my opinion, the system is perfect we have to learn it and the entry are particular sets up are indicated, remember a setup is not a trade, up to you to do your homework if the setup is valid or not what the ratio how many pips you may get if the trade goes in your favour, so many decisions involved only practised, practised will make you an expert, been trading for many years with a little succeed but that system for me a winner. do not give up he takes years to understand Forex , years ago was jumping to a new system every month to get nothing, bought many of them but the most important good set-up where missing from all of them sure did get a lot of experience doing so but a realized to trade in 4 hrs time frame was the best,15 minutes too stressful .that my point of view thanks again from the master to give us a free system or work perfect but not every day the market can be up and down do not rush let the trade come to you if no trade try the next day patience, didn't trade for a week the market was unpredictable and no momentum . cheers

TDT, Great thread indeed here. Concerning the VMA,TV Template indicator, does one of the alerts activate when a new candle appears, after a period of being flatlined? Could be useful. Regards

Can we get a TradingView package?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Yea! The 500 Circles on your Chart really give me a clear visual! Thanks for sharing. I am sorry if I hit your Ego somewhere. I know a few things are difficult to accept! Good luck in your Circle Trading. Cheers

--- 帖子 #279 ---
We are currently working on it

--- 帖子 #280 ---
You don't need to rude, dude! Why do you think that luck is the important factor in trading? Is your trading based on luck?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The only thing you wrote here is that 99% of the System is useless and irritating and then show a Chart with a million Circles. Now you play the victim, saying that I am the rude person. Luck is indeed an important factor in trading. Doesnt matter if you have an edge or not, sometimes the Market just barely misses your stoploss and hits your Target right after. This is LUCK and sometimes that luck can give you a lot of Money! Nothing wrong with that. Trading is like a coinflip with hopefully a slightly weighted coin in your favour. I have been in contact with several People that have more Trading experience than I am old and they also openly share when they get lucky in a trade. Sometimes you can of course also get unlucky. Your Ego is the problem in your Trading. Drop your Ego a bit and you might get somewhere. This is the last message I write you. I dont need annoying mosquitos that pretend to know all in this Thread. Dont waste People's time. You can do that in the "trade made simple" thread, with those other Ego inflated People. Cheers!

Hi, Thanks for making this system available to interested persons. I have put the folder into Indicators and when I view contents it shows three more folders and a template. I am not sure which one I have to use to get it to work in navigator. I tried the temolate but that is not showing in the list. can you give guidance please.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
1. Download the file "TDT Reich System Final update.rar" from post 1 somewhere on your local repository 2. Unpack it - after this you will have a folder named "TDT Reich System" and a template file named "! TDT Reich System Final.tpl" 3. Copy the template file in MT4 template folder 4. Copy the folder "TDT Reich System" in MT4 indicators folder 5. Open MT4 6. Open a new chart and load the template Hope it helps!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I am forward testing your system. oNe thing i noticed, it's kinda heavy on my old PC, it works fine with my laptop though. I shorted XAUUSD on the first on the red arrow and right after price was rejected on the moving average around 1642.00 level. I'm still holding positions with stop loss just right above swing high. i will publish my results. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thank you so much for this. Very good system. I'm perfectly using the final version but I'm getting a lot of delay as the MT4 is very slow. Takes about 2-3 minutes to go from one chart to the next. Any way to avoid this? Am I missing something? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Try to delete the indicator "XUSemafor" this should help you!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Yes it works fine now after i remove semafor, thanks it seems my XAUUSD is in profit and still ridding it just move SL to recent swing high on 15min.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hello, traders check the post every day I am amazed why peoples try to set up different indicators god's sake the original system is a winner why not stick to the original so simple used my template with no lugging at all .you have to practise and learn it .do not expect the system to give you all, please learn it he won't happen overnight but if you are committed you to be a winner .just check all my winning trades so far very good .just enter the trade that let the winner run maybe 2 days or 3 days all depends the market can be slow then suddenly moving fast to your target, please do not give up.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
so make sure you have many winners on the demo and then go live the only way to go.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
ofc, i'm experienced trader i just love seeing new systems, i have a pretty profitable system myself. but im always lurking, because you never know when something comes a long better

Not sure why when I use this particular template the MT4 stalls and becomes very slow.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
oh very sad you must have a new platform only with that system on it , in the tools section update all the currency on the 4 hrs and in the tools again options chart put only 5000 bars history all should be fine .good luke

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #348 ---
hello again that me Okie traders, in my opinion, the best system is free. please stick to the system that the best one you buy $ 2000 or $ 3000 never come close to that one if you fail on the one you buy they will say oh was the wrong time or another excuse blabla a know been there. now forget to backtest that a nono is never accurate only live is the real game here . now when a started demo on 0.1 to be secured was lucky to have the most winner cause a am patient and enter the trade when all conditions are set, you have to remember for the beginner a set-up trade is not a trade yet until you check all possible what the trend if contre trend only experienced trader can do it too risky if you do not know what you are doing , how many pips to your target , make sure no crucial announcement from the bank or country update. your level is very important you may be taking out if you have stop lost .only a lot of practice will make you a very good trader remember discipline. Besides you enter your trade and no worry no need scalping let the trade run less stressed to easily. all the best

Apart of what ellenbrook said - which is crystal correct - you can try to remove Partizan Currency Strength Board - it's quite CPU consuming .... Or you can start from the hard core of the wonderful TDT system - which is VMA,TV Candles/Template and XU ma simple BT ( ribbon ) in window 0, and XU RSI MA and XU DSL OBV in window 1. Put only these ones - they alone perform a wonderful job in giving you quality trading information. And after that, try to add the other indies ( starting with TDI, which sometimes is very useful ) until you see that MT4 starts to freeze .... Hope this helps you.

No offense. One indicator has a 50:50 success rate, similar to a coin toss. Will the success rate improve with 100 coins?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
oh see I understand but I am very happy with the one user in another chart ,.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
You are the perfect example of someone that has barely looked at the System or any System even trying to truly understand why and what purpose certain indicators have and how exactly they are being used. The System consists of more than 1 Indicator. How did you come up with that success rate? with a 1:1? with a 1:2? I take a 50% winrate with a 1:2RR any day What stoploss did you take? A wide SL? A tight SL? Did you put your Trade to breakeven at some point? Are you trailing your Stop at some point? Did you try to use your trading experience as confluence to determine whether a signal should be taken or not? Did you try to use other Timeframes as confluence to determine whether a signal should be taken or not? Did you look at the current Market environment? Are we trending? Are the Charts messy? Are we Ranging? Do you have a Plan what you do in those 3 environments? I'll give you a hint, the System is flexible enough that you can trade all 3 of those. You need to stop just accept everything what People say and instead start thinking on your own. There is a lot of AMAZING free content available, including my System, but if you never question anything and just accept everything that a Person tells you without thinking on your own then you will be always one step behind. Not only in Trading, but also in your normal daily life.

I have managed to get the chart working live after re-reading some of the help posts. Thankyou. I have red and green candles/lines on black bacground . The current moving price line is dark grey so does not show up very well. I note a number of example charts use different colours. Is it possible to change the price line colour? The chart is also a bit sluggish and it has been mentioned to remove the XU 43 indicator. Will this help or any other suggestions?

Keep practicing using the DEMO, any indicator will display a similar view, your conclusion in manual trading will be able to understand what the indicator conveys, like a chef who is able to mix food into dishes, if you want to go up to the class of setting up a restaurant, you have to start learning management Likewise in FX, understanding what is conveyed by a combination of several indicators is a basic requirement that must be met, but if you want to level up like a chef in a restaurant..... you have to exert all your skills in FX and combine them in an EA as a form of management and your rules after that you just sit pretty while monitoring your EA and doing things that EA misses below is just an example, in just 70 minutes you can reach 258 Pips of course with management trading on an EA Really, you have good initial skills, stay focused on the indi/system that you are currently using, while slowly entering what is in your head in an EA, if you start now maybe in 1-2 years your EA can accommodate all your abilities Good luck Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks Abade because of you and TDT Cofee I found the formula to control my Robot, the EMA I use on "XU 5 XARDFX" is 3,6,9 on H1 and the Volume I use is dsl obv Today was really tiring, testing and playing trading on a Demo account, after a week before testing on a tester strategy And it turns out that 95% automatic trading can be applied if the target is large, and 99% can be fully automatic if the target is 0.4-1% can also be applied, 3128 Pips a Day is my highest achievement using 95% automatic trading Once again, thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I am always here reading and answering if there are any questions. A few guys here post their Trades and profits they make thanks to the ReichSystem, so I dont think I need to proof anything and post my Trades or post much more. If there are questions, you are more than welcome to ask! I will occasionally Post things in this Thread, but Trading,Mentoring and keeping my Wife happy uses a lot of time. Sadly the Day only has 24hours. Wish it had more!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Ask and it shall be given, knock and the doors will be opened. I think I got this correct

--- 帖子 #497 ---
.... and after that 24hrs it wont end thr! by God's grace another and many more 24hrs to come! Thank you Chris for the system!

--- 帖子 #498 ---
There is currently no EA out for the ReichSystem. Market's are constantly changing. So the EA's needs constant changes as well. an EA might be useful for giving you a Setup signal, so you dont miss out on a Trade, but trades should be in most cases taken manually for your own good.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Ok... Ok.. then.. What we want? EA for 'Signal Setup'.. EA for 'Signal Setup'..

I think more people are simply communicating via the telegram group vs here. I dont think its dying. Just people want faster communication/ responses.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Most Thread's "die" when there is no arguing. Look at 99% of the Trading Systems Threads. Its either the Creator spamming Trades or 1-2 other People who actually understood the Value of the System. You posting your Trades will end up helping you more than anyone else. You Posting your live Entries will give you at some point a big confidence boost in your ability to Trade. Keep it up! You are not posting for others, but you are posting for yourself. I dont need nor want a "Trade made Simple" Thread with 5 People harrassing each other for 6 Years straight every day. If People dont write here its either because they gave up before even trying or they are busy making Money with this amazing System.

PVSRA : https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...me-sr-analysis Hi, Traderathome in post 1 PVSRA, gives his very interesting version of the functioning of Forex (unregulated) and Market Makers thieves. And to be certain that we lose, access to the volumes is not given to us. This is why no strategy, no matter how very good like this one, can really win in the long term with an EA. 50% strategy and 50% analysis? Let's not dream, with a discretionary analysis, anyway, we only have a one in two chance of being in the right direction. At any time, the market can go in one direction or another. No one can predict what the market makers will decide Take care jf

Yes, I check MN and W1, trying to see what's going on

I've seen a tonne of indicator-based systems, not to mention price action-based systems, posted, and most of the time, if you're lucky, the person who started the thread and a few fortunate Subscribers who persisted might make it work for them. What I have underlined in blue makes sense; you must develop "Independent Thinking" if you want to succeed as a trader. Anyway, I would advise paying attention to price when indicators start to look hazy .

Hi thank you for sharing what looks to be a great system with us. I have 2 questions - the metal tool box button does not seem to work for me in as much it is fine whilst in the off position but if i try to switch to on it does not state on but instead shows the text beneath the button with a white backgound for the size of the button only. Also i am assuming the button, when switched on, shows the different currency pairs available which brings me onto my next question, if the button is working and on, would i be emailed by the system everytime an alert goes off? Thanks

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi AnitaNixon, Thanks for referencing my Post 20

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hey! Make sure the "Metatoolbox" Indicator is attached at all to your Chart. If you want to get alerts you need to check the individual Indicators. Many of them have Alerts you can turn on in the Settings.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Sorry for the confusion. No there is no paid Version for MT4. I wrote it as in "The MT4 System is completely for free"

--- 帖子 #511 ---
That's what the use of the template and indicators in the archive gives. Even the color of the candles cannot be forcibly changed, not to mention the absence of the necessary ones (and which ones are not specified). In fact, just a bare graph with non-verbal elements. The author apparently created and saved the template incorrectly, or the necessary indicators are missing in the archive.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Or you try to follow the Steps which the Author outlined. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Show me your MT4 Indicator Menu

--- 帖子 #541 ---
For the first time in many years I have come across the fact that the template refuses to load indicators directly from the \MQL4\Indicators folder. Indeed, you are right and the right way turned out to be \MQL4\Indicators\Think Different Trading Indicator Collection\T DT Reich System. Thanks !

--- 帖子 #542 ---
A problem no ? this is what i get when i unzip your rar file

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Nevertheless, "Metatoolbox" does not react to switching currency pairs, it does not switch them. There is a click sound when pressed and the "OFF" button works, but it does not switch currency pairs. What could be the problem ?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi TDT. i am new on this platform and to Forex trading in general. I wish to learn how to use this your system, but which of the versions do i download and how do i install the program?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Figured it out ! The suffix is not specified.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
this is not the zip file I have shared

--- 帖子 #547 ---
If you look at your Symbol from your Broker, then you will notice that your Broker uses a suffix ".rann" or something. You need to then go into metatoolbox and add there the suffix. There is no problem with the Indicator.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Sorry all right now Because it's a new PC Win 11 ...

Every think is working fine. I am so excited to try this strategy when the market opens. Thank you so much for sharing

Which indicator draws bubbles ? I don't have any. I want bubbles for Christmas ! In general , I figured it out . Everything is logical. The author is well done ! But I don't have bubbles on the charts, and I want these bubbles.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Also thanks to the author for an interesting idea and system. As a token of gratitude, I want to give you the address of a unique Broker. The broker allows you to make order execution settings. For example , I enter the market with a market order , BUT IT WILL BE SENT TO THE SUPPLIER AS A LIMIT ORDER , AND , IN ADDITION , I CAN CHOOSE THE AMOUNT OF SLIPPAGE ALLOWED FOR ME IN POINTS !!! Other brokers do not provide similar settings to their clients. Why? The answer is obvious. And u https://rannforex.com/en/?fprc=j2k6n2 these settings are available. Statistics on the total amount of financial assets, customer funds, the company's trade turnover, the number of accounts, accounts with a positive balance, the drawdown of the company and much more are open. The company is completely transparent. Liquidity providers are eliminated if they start to perform worse. In general, come in, get acquainted, you will not regret it. This is a screenshot from my account on which you can see these very settings. I use only one, someone more advanced will of course use more settings to protect against the lawlessness of liquidity providers. I forgot to say that this is not an advertisement. It's just that there are a lot of professionals trading there.

[quote=lipopos;14266169]Also thanks to the author for an interesting idea and system. As a token of gratitude, I want to give you the address of a unique Broker. The broker allows you to make order execution settings. This company is registered in the Seychelle's, with ridiculous leverage offers. You should be very careful about investing your hard earnt money with an unregistered broker in an offshore company, where there is no jurisdiction if things go belly up.

I will share with you my opinion until TDT will be active here again: I don't think it's the final update, only the last one. And concerning which version should use, I think it's the best thing to try them all, understand them and choose which one is best for your trading profile.

Except for the iclock bar timer every tool is working flawlessly within this recent version .The bar timer's output on lower time frames gives inaccurate readings. Is there a setting that I may have missed ?
