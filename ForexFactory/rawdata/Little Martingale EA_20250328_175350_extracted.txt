Hi, I made this litle martingale EA which survived Brexit, If Anybody thinks that it can be improved I'll be happy to change the code and share it. It opens a Buy and a Sell every desired interval at a multiple n of lots from the previous order. It closes the basket at a desired profit in cash. Cheers! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Yes.

Hello, what setting, timeframe and pair you use?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hmmm ... another Marti-EA ... survived the Brexit .... did that survival happen by chance ? I saw during the years a lot of these grid/marti EAs ... None of them survived ... sooner or later they all crashed ....

--- 帖子 #4 ---
hmmmm.......

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hmmm .... a back test ! Does that mean anything ? No.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I use every pair, 0.02 lots 80.000 quid.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
It all depends on the risk and the available equity. If you have a profitable system please share it, thanks.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
You can take any free Martin EA, to optimize it on any past time period, incliding Brexit, and to get some settings as result. These settings will lead your EA to crash, when you'll apply them to any other time period. This is the kid's trap.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
ok people we all know what martingale means, this thread only purpose is for people who have positive ideas about how to improve it. If you don't have any positive idea refrain to post BS. thanks.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hi mate , Thanks for posting the EA , i tested it and I have some Ideas to prevent from more DD by adding some more indicators filters. I wants to add them and make some changes and then take backtest of few years on EURO , But to do that I need source code. If you wish kindly share it to me by PM and if i got success I will share the same with you . Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
seem quite good EA, i will test it, thank bro

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Personally I am a big fan of Martingale EAs and I fully understand the risks involved. With the right balance of deposit, starting lot and multiplier we could greatly reduce the risks. Can you please explain the EA settings so that we can understand better how it works.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hello Can u please help make this martingale EA for me . I am already using martingale. But this is the improve version . I hope you will programme I have attached the ea instructions Thanks in advance

when trades closes?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
space, space1 and space2 are the value of pipetes between orders. spaceorders,space1orders and spece2orders are the number of orders that the EA will open using the space, space1 and space2 values. f.ex: according to ootb settings the EA will open 6 orders (Buy and sell) at an interval of 200 pipetes, 5 orders at 1000 and the rest of the orders at 2000. suspendtrades: if set to true the EA will not open any other new order when the basket is closed. cheers!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
what kind of indicators do you wish to add?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
trades will be closed when the basket reaches the specified value in the account base currency set as "profit".

--- 帖子 #18 ---
thx for sharing we will see could you please implement in EA free possibility for "comment"?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You're welcome Post #1 updated with comments on orders, a new layer of ordes, close all sells and close all buys now new setting. cheers!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Eg we have 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.02 0.02 these 6 trades open . First 5 trades will close at breakeven and last six will have its own X figure tp

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Demo , BrokersTime=GMT+3, no hedging allowed Attached Image (click to enlarge) edit: 09:21 GMT comment now works, thank you. Could you give the EA new Var in its name if you change it? edit: 11:17 GMT - comment no longer appears with new deals - close all (long) Close is only partial, not all deals

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Post #1 updated, comments fixed new variable (globalprofit) to close ALL trades when a user defined total profit is reached. " comment now works, thank you. Could you give the EA new Var in its name if you change it?" I don't fully understand. cheers!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Agree. I should give it a try in forward test...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
thx @Joan - Name of EA if you change EA UnNomGuai.ex4 please name it in#1 UnNomGuai_ Var1 ...Varx otherwise we do not know is there something changed, thx for your quickly work - closeall buys(sell)now what do you mean? I understood if I choose closeallxx that all existing deals would be closed. But it does not or in parts only will be done

--- 帖子 #25 ---
comment is not totally fixed if I close some trades manually following trades have no comment Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #26 ---
it seems you do not agree in DerBerliner but in Joan

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I adopted your suggestion, thanks for your feedback if you set closeallbuysnow it will close all buys from the pair you have the EA attached to. I'll forward test to see if I can spot the comment bug. cheers! updated post #1 adressing closeallbuysnow and closeallsellsnow bug.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Your EA worked really impressive while market was trending . Attached Image (click to enlarge) This time I used broker allowed no hedging. (underlying must bee the same. If bought long EURUSD (or other underlyings) allowed only to add long EURUSD not EURUSD short same time) Now EA starts with long . If market is trending short this does not help. Then to go to short. If markets goes sideways I would prefer broker who allowed hedge. (same time EURUSD long&amp;short) Do not know whether you want to implement the market trend into the EA. Maybe you have a completely different concept. Trades can also help themselfes with the choice of broker as described above.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I will like to see a CCI level indicator on your EA

--- 帖子 #30 ---
It's a fun EA to watch. What settings do you use? How large was the draw down during the Brexit period? What was the largest lot size traded on your account?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Updated post#1 with CCI cheers!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I use this setting, when brexit happened I was not trading live it survives backtests lots=0.02 space=500.0 spaceorders=6 space1=1000.0 space1orders=2 space2=2000.0 space2orders=99 multiplier=1.5 ratio=30 profit per 0.1 lots profit=5.0 magicbuy=34 magicsell=35 suspendtrades=false and testing this wich results in a higher profit: lots=0.02 space=100.0 spaceorders=5 space1=500.0 space1orders=1 space2=1000.0 space2orders=1 space3=2000.0 space3orders=99 multiplier=1.5 profit=0.0 globalprofit=10.0 hello=hello magicbuy=1 buycomment=buy magicsell=2 sellcomment=sell suspendtrades=false closeallsellsnow=false closeallbuysnow=false

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks for sharing, it's a nice EA, from what I have seen in backtests it's a not a set and forget system as every martingale EA should have manual intervention at some point. Nevertheless, excellent job you'made here, I'm gonna continue to test it and share if there is something i can add to improve the EA performance. Thanks again and good luck.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
works well @joan using broker who allows hedging too I will observe and post after some days

--- 帖子 #35 ---
helloo.. this is great EA , of course with a big margin and leverage, this EA will work well.. thanks for sharing, but how much balance that we must set that you suggested with yours setting?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I would suggest 100.000 per 0.01 lots Updated post #1 now it can be used with other EAs, closeallorders now bug fixed. I'm also testing this setting with 24 pairs and globalprofit set to 1000 it looks cool lots=0.02 space=100.0 spaceorders=5 space1=500.0 space1orders=1 space2=1000.0 space2orders=1 space3=2000.0 space3orders=99 multiplier=1.5 profit=0.0 globalprofit=1000.0 hello=hello magicbuy=1 buycomment=buy magicsell=2 sellcomment=sell cciperiod=0 ccimax=100.0 ccimin=-100.0 suspendtrades=false closeallsellsnow=false closeallbuysnow=false

--- 帖子 #37 ---
100.000 per 0.01 lots for 24 pairs? or only 1 pair?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I use 24 pairs but it's up to you. cheers!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Dear joancb You must have plenty of open position by trading 24 pairs. Do you close them all at Friday night?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Joancb, Thanks for sharing... backtest are very impressive... if I undestand "profit" close single order at single reached value, and "globalprofit" close all orders at reached value then if your are using 24 pairs, did you attached the ea to 24 charts? and it will "closeatprofit" all orders at the same time, isn't it? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #41 ---
probably he\she uses it on demo, otherwise wouldnt name it "Little Martingale EA " ......on 24 pairs?.....that is simply crazy and i know about EA s lol, not that i'm a coder but i tested tons of them. 24 pairs on martingale? come on.... by the way aside from this thread and this applies to any strategy and EA: BACKTESTING IS USELESS results never match the forward tests (demo or live). i will test this one too of course

--- 帖子 #42 ---
nope I don't, but that's an option to test. cheers!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Correct. That's what I do. p.s. well it is 28 pairs really.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I use it live. why not name it martingale if it is what it is? I know the possiblility to burn the account is real. Just minimize the risk not trading red news, small lots and funding the account properly. It is the only way I know to make money. If somebody knows a better way you are welcome to post it. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi Joan, great thread and thanks for sharing. It sure looks like your live trading goes well and "safe" with a max. DD of 8 - 9 % - bravo! How do you stay out of red news? Close positions before or? Also can I ask what lot size do you trade the displayed live account? Gracias! PC

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I would like to share my experience with multipliers here. The only useful multipliers I have found are those in between x1.01 and x1.05. The multiplier of x1.05 is a monster big multiplier. I use it only on daily LIMIT breakouts or when I "hedge" the x1.05 trades with opposite trades multiplied by 1.01. Leaving space/distance in between the trend and counter trend trades. Locking profits, shortly put. I also use it in my positive net pips strategies, usually trend following. It is quite heavy multiplier if used on more than just a trade a day... Here is the major thing. You must find positive net pips before you even start using multipliers. I will give you an example. You want to trade the trend. But the rate flips quite a bit. You have to have net positive pips AHEAD (with the trend), whatever the direction. Or just trade the set up (limit or stop orders) where the positive pips are . This is absolutely crucial. The net positive pips gained with a multiplier of 1.00 (no multiplier) - you have to find them before doing anything else. After you get them (the net positive pips), you can start planning what multiplier you will use. x1.05 can be quite deadly multiplier, especially when in use in negative net pips strategy. Most strategies are offering negative net pips btw. Thus the bankers just eat you for a breakfast.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yes, I close positions setting suspendtrade to true. Depending on the news, if they are very "market movers", I will close them all even at loss. I trade 0.02 lots for every pair. cheers!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks for the input! that's the key point, finding the positive pips, I've searched but not found them. cheers!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I've not yet test you ea. Question, how many level of position do you have on single pair? well.. I assume you already calculate beforehand, the margin requirements &amp; capital required (on single pair), to open those positions.. let alone 24 pairs! with 0.02 lot!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
these are really monster hard to find. it is useless to trade, if you do not have a system with at least +1 net pip per trade. the spread will eat it, but that is ok. it gives you a good foundation, where you can start building your stores... I could not find more than 8-9 positive pips per trade (on avg). They usually are in between 0.5 and 2.5 pips. That is very little, but that is all they offer, unfortunately. All strategies fail, because they cant find positive net pips. They use martingale to compensate this disadvantage... Don't trade if you cant find positive net pips. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
i found it hard to achieve with multiplier 1.02~1.05, rather 1.95~2.05 is a good number. it means that, we can close the whole sequence (in positive money), just above previous open order sequence. well..just my opinion, I have that ea system running in my account for more than 8 months now. 7 layers max.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Very few, magicians I call them, can make money with systems with negative pips disadvantage. I guess, most of people are just far away from making it into that special club.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
well.. I guess we both enter "different" special club at different country LOL. good luck brother.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I believe you. very happy for your results, will definitely test it, maybe on less pairs lol i see you have 1:1000 leverage? wow

--- 帖子 #55 ---
yes, this is a cent account, from 20$ to 100$ you can get 1:1000 leverage. cheers!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Joan, I make some trials. I set Profit=10 and Globalprofit 20. Profit is not closing my single order at 10 ? Maybe I miss something in logic understanding. Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Profit is not looking at single order. It is looking at all your trades on that pair. When the net value of all your trades for E/U reaches 10 it will then close.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes that's correct. I've spotted a bug with globalprofit variable, and I'm currently forward testing to adress it asap. be warned and use it only on demo. cheers!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Sorry if it has already been answered, but I could not find in the thread the time frame used. I saw only a chart with 30', but I am not sure it is the real one. I like Martingales and this looks nice. I am setting a cent account to try it.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
[Quote = joancb; 9899346] {cita} S que es correcto. He vi a un error con variables globalprofit, y estoy actualmente impulsando las pruebas para adress lo antes posible. ser advertido y utilizarlo slo en demostracin. saludos! [/ quote] Hi joan 1.- thank you very much for sharing I see interesting the ea and the thread, let's try to look for improvements in the robot if it can. 2. - I am testing the ea, default parameters, I do not find logic to the global profit, I say this because the ea will always be in negative balance and will be closing partial positives. Another person in the group and I comment.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi, it doesn't matter TF. It only matters if you use the CCI option. cheers!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
It will close partial positives if you set the 'profit' input parametre bigger than zero. If you set it to zero and 'globalprofit' bigger than zero it will close all trades in positive. cheers! P.s. updated post #1 with a provisional globalprofit bug fix. It will need more forward test to be 100% sure it works.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thank you very much joan I will try. My opinions are constructive of your work

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Fine Joan, thank you! I 'm doing trials on 3 pairs form monday on EURSSD AUDUSD and CHFJPY. Winngs are very stables for profit=10 (with your above settings). I didn't try "globalprofit" for the moment. But to avoid weekend open orders I think it could be a good idea use it before weekend: - from sunday to wednesday: "profit" strategy (which close only 1 pair each time reached goal) - thursday-friday: "globalprofit" strategy for positions closing ok?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thanks joancb for the EA, started in the morning forward testing on my ECN demo acc. After some hours I cut 2 pairs and continue with 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
current status ... probably crash will soon ..... Tomorrow will continue with same 3 pairs, lot from 0.1 to 0.05 and some new settings

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Joan, I started trying your EA that I must admit is really intriguing me. A question: from your experience is it useful to close some trades? The positive ones, maybe; or the negative? Yesterday I used it only few hours with only one pair and I was lucky and closed manually with some pips. I was surprised when I closed the trades and I saw that the EA started a new couple of trades immediately. I thought it would open new positions only with a new candle. So I had to cancel 'Allow live trading' and close again. Then I prepared 14 charts and started the EA when the market was closed. Stupid, as the spreads were high! The basket did not do a lot and it is now floating around even. I will update about results. A couple of ideas: 1. I miss a button that allows to close all the trades (and stop temporarily the EA) Useful after news that give spikes clearly not sustainable. Closing all the trades manually would be problematic and not fast enough. 2. Same, but only for some currencies, like: all the pairs with USD or EUR. 3. Again one button to close all the trades in positive (and another for negative). To avoid cluttering all the charts, maybe all the buttons could be put in a panel that can be made visible or hidden depending on a setting of the EA Thanks again for your EA.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi, I think it could be a good strategy, forward test it and tell us how it goes. cheers!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Sorry Babaji to make all this fancy buttons would requiere more coding hours than I currently have. If I have time I will code it as new imput settings. cheers! I've updated post#1 with new settings and finally adressing closeallordersnow bug. maximaloss: put a negative value in $ and all orders will be closed when total loss reaches that number opennewcandle: if set to true subsequent orders will only be opened at the start of a new candle

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Thanks for this EA which is working brilliantly on demo but I think may be nerves of steel would be required to go live. I have been trading at 60 minutes but has any one found it performs best on any other timeframe?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi Joan I tried " UnNomGuaiV1.6.ex4 " on an existing chart. With folowing settings profit: 10 globalprofit=16 and maximaloss:-50 it closed me all positions just with -6€ of losses and didn't re.open new positions.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Joan, Can you please indicate which EA revision are you using on your live account and what is the exact settings you use? I am currently forward testing the EA for about two weeks but all the opened &amp; closed trades are of the same size 0.01 There is no martingale function in my account. Thank you..

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I forgot to mention that I am using the original EA (UnNomGuai) with the default settings.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi, I'm using this version, with these settings, cheers! lots=0.02 space=500.0 spaceorders=5 space1=1000.0 space1orders=1 space2=2000.0 space2orders=99 space3=2000.0 space3orders=99 multiplier=1.5 profit=5.0 globalprofit=0.0 magicbuy=1 buycomment=buy magicsell=2 sellcomment=sell cciperiod=0 ccimax=100.0 ccimin=-100.0 suspendtrades=false closeallsellsnow=false closeallbuysnow=false

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi, I've tested this version and it works fine on my side, I don't know what could be the issue, anybody else is having problems with profit/globalprofit/maximaloss variables? what I've noticed is a difficulty on JPY pairs not respecting spaceorders. cheers!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi joancb I love your EA very much I have an idea : Add a lots setting after space Add a lots setting after space 1 Add a lots setting after space 2 Add a lots setting after space 3 This way there are four other lots can be set Also in the multiplier which side set up a switch (true or false) Choose to use multiplier &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; true Choose to use the new settings &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; false The whole new setting will look like the following lots=0.02 space=500.0 space_lots=0.03 spaceorders=5 space1=1000.0 space1_lots=0.05 space1orders=1 space2=2000.0 space2_lots=0.07 space2orders=99 space3=2000.0 space3_lots=0.09 space3orders=99 use_multiplier=false multiplier=1.5 profit=5.0 globalprofit=0.0 magicbuy=1 buycomment=buy magicsell=2 sellcomment=sell cciperiod=0 ccimax=100.0 ccimin=-100.0 suspendtrades=false closeallsellsnow=false closeallbuysnow=false Thanks again for your EA.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi, updated post#1 with all te changes. just set multiplier to 0 and the new lots settings will be used. cheers!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Nice EA, is it an option to add a max profit, and when he hits that profit the ea stops? i prefer to closed all my trades at the end of the week Many thanks for the ea Greatings from the Netherlands

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I would like to see someone building a reverse martingale adding when winning instead ... anyone ever heard about that ?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi, if possible to have StartHour and EndHour. Started v1.7 forward test on 2 accounts with slight different settings. Actually I want to aivoid Asian session.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
You can set globalprofit to max profit and suspendtrades to true so it will not open any other trade. cheers!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Nice MartG EA, Thank you for sharing it.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
updated post#1 cheers!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi, thanks. Please check it. If suspendtrades is set to true then EA does not start to tradeing (same with v1.6) Thank you, andres

--- 帖子 #86 ---
that is what it is supposed to do.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi Joan, thx for the EA, this is great, ive tested on my Real acc and slowly but sure its work great.. just a little ideas, can you put a Total Profit per pair? in NuomGuoai V1.6 its just Total For GlobalProfit.. so I mean, this is like a global profit but this setting just for a pair, and we can set this in all pair that we trade in, so when the difference between Buy and Sell reach the target, it will closeorder in that pair.. this setting maybe can avoid a long Floating that can be dangerous for our Balance, thats just some ideas, thankyou, your so Great!

--- 帖子 #88 ---
updated post #1 cheers!

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi joancb, first, thanks for your work :-) I have one question to the CCI option. What does it exactly do? Only trading within the range, or only short if cci &gt; 100 and long if cci &lt; -100? My current setup is: cciperiod: 14 ccimax 100 ccimin -100 Thanks in advance Best regards Siero

--- 帖子 #90 ---
You're welcome :O) when cci &gt;100 and crosses down the 100 line it opens a sell. when cci&lt;-100 and crosses up the -100 line it opens a buy.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
ok thanks. I will have a look. Do you recommend using the cci option? :-)

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I don't use it, what I would recommend is to set openewcandle to true. cheers!

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi joancb, the option "opennewcandle" set to "true" of cause makes the TF the EA is applied to more important. Do You have a suggestion therefor, too? Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #94 ---
What is it will do? Cheers

--- 帖子 #95 ---
With this option set to true, the EA opens new positions only at a new candle. That means 60 times the possibility of a new order on M1 compared to 1 possible order on H1. Of cause according to the grid size.. Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Thank for the answer Barlam. Which version is it that have this option, I use v1.4, it does not have it there. Cheers

--- 帖子 #97 ---
hm..i think this is rong, i worked with cci long time.. when cci crosses 100 level from down to up, it must open a buy order, not a sell, and viceversa for -100 level, if its crosses from up to down must open a sell order. if it posible to change this setting to what i recomend it will be nice, also if it is posible to add cci price(for change parametre), and if for exemple i whant to change 100 level and -100 level to 0 and 0 levels, when crose 0 from down to up, it must open buy,when cross 0 level from up to down, it must open sell.. rest of parametres are good, and no need change. sorry if i ask to much, but i think EA can be more powerfull with this settings.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Very good job. Can you put in minutes of the timer, because it will also be able to run news.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Updated post #1 with the changes required on the CCI and minutes of the timer, It has not been extensively tested so there can be some bugs, test it on demo first. cheers!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I started testing the EA, version 1.4/1.5 on a cent account, starting with some 170$. 14 charts, 0.02 lot. Settings like Joan's. After few days the balance is up 10 bucks (I closed trades manually most of the times), but the DD is around 20. Results in my Explorer.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks, but the minutes do not work. At start time 15:29 to 15.31 does not follow the assignment .. I'm sorry, but my idea is to enter only once for the news at 15:30, which means one entrance a day.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Joancb I traded Martingale last year and grew account from 3 to 15 k in 2 months just to lose it in 2 weeks. I have extensive experience in making money with MG and losing it. I started working on an idea on how to combine the strategy with another strategy and have some programmers working on it at the moment. The thing with MG is very interesting. The smaller the grid(combined with the bigger you grow your lots) the faster it grows, but the bigger the chances to blow your account. I dont understand your EA fully,but it looks like your grid is quit big and your multiplier slower than the one that i used. I traded gold and for that i managed to handle a 240 pip grid quit comfortably. Like one of the members said, that eventually it will blow your account. This happened when Gold moved 700 pips on usd interest rate speculation. The problem i had was that movement. It took me quit a while to realise that there is an opposite to MG which is called momentum. Now MG lose a lot, but make very little. Momentum lose little, but make a lot. Now by letting these two guys fighting it out amonst each other, but making the one stronger by decreasing the grid and increasing the lot to the winningside and making the other weaker by increasing the grid and growing the lots slower was my answer. There is some technical stuff that i would not reveal to you right now, because i want you to think. You have the losing trade with MG and you have the winningtrade with momentum how do you treat the winning trade?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
My strategy is based on your last assumptions, the way I manage the winning trade is to setup a stop loss in winning side positions, so they only exists to protect the account and reduce the drawdown caused by the martingale side. If a pair reaches really extreme values(this is on weekly and monthly timeframes, like euro range from 1.05 to - 1-15), and you still have the winning side open i close it manually, lock the profit, and then the martingale side will do the rest. This is the way I prevent the account to be blown. This strategy needs manual intervention and good money management, it's not a set and forget system. GL to all.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Ok, lets look at the beginning. The EA opens a buy and a sell. There is no identy to each the buy and the sell. As we do not know if it will be a winning trade or a losing trade. We will only know this if the second trade opens. What if in this example: the trade goes up and your buy trade opens a second trade on 20 pips, but your sell trade is only set to open on 40 pips. Your buy immediately moves a stop loss in place 75% of trade. Your sell is not open, yet. Your grid for increasing the buy grid looks something like this 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128.... Your sell grid 20 pips more apart looks something like this 1,1,1,3,6,9,12,15,17,21......... The buy grid can go up and retrace multiple times, but can not run away with you.... and if it goes up to fast your winnings will exceed your losses.. if it goes up slower and the buy retrace you get a second MG that must adhere to the losing trade parameters.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi Joancb, I have tested your EA and result is good but I think the above idea is better. Could you pls code EA with this idea? Rgds

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I think it works now, updated post #1 cheers!

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Yes, it is very interesting, I'll try to code it but I don't fully understand, I will need time to read and re-read the posts to grasp it. Maybe you can put it in your words and set some examples. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi joancb Suggest 1. About time control suggest you use world standard time, That is, GMT, Because the time is not the same place, this parameter is better set 2. I found that using "globalprofit" would be the same as using "pairglobalprofit", so what's the difference between the two? Thanks again for your EA.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
The time control is refereed to your broker time, you can see it at the market watch window. globalprofit refers to all pairs and pairglobalprofit refers only to the pair you have the EA attached to. cheers!

Благодаря, но протоколите не работят. В начален час 15:29 до 15.31 не следва заданието .. Съжалявам, но идеята ми е да се влиза само веднъж за новините в 15:30, което означава един вход на ден. Мисля, че тя работи в момента, актуализиран пост # 1 наздраве! Yes, the timer works for which I thank, but can a daily trading function be used - the number of operations per day that is related to the robot's work using a CCI filter with a closed candle input. thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi, I set CCI 14 but it does not work. Could you please see my input and point out if I have some thing wrong At present I define trend and have EA run with my control "long" or "short" and have good result Could you pls consider my idea: when price run right way and position is positive EA will add more orders after "xxx" point Thanks

--- 帖子 #112 ---
HELP? Can someone help me by telling me - why when I have more than 6 operations in a group with total profits settings, it closes the group to minus, and this minus represents 20-30% of the gain so far. What settings to give to have no negative result for a group. Greetings

Working on it...

--- 帖子 #116 ---
these are results (see statement and graph) in a bit more than one week with the Little martingale EA. i put all major pairs on 1 min timeframe (default settings) and an initial balance of 1200 euros (i ask now if this is this too little according to the author reccomendation?). results so far are good and equity is not too far from balance, there are -152 in open trades and the balance grew 322 (this is net of commissions and eventual swaps). I use a real ECN broker (Global Prime), relatively low spread , max 1 pip on majors usually on eur\usd only 0.4-0.6 pips commissions are 0.06 euros / 0.01 lot Thans for sharing this EA, i know its just one week but at least it hasn't blown yet lol any suggestions on minimum account balance or timeframe or else are welcome. this test is with default settings, no changes have been made the thing i liked the most is that max lot taken by the EA so far was 0.12(i think), not bad. whats the max lot that it will take? is there a limit?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
ПОМОГНЕ? Може ли някой да ми помогне, като ми каза - защо, когато имам повече от 6 операции в една група с настройките на общата печалба, тя се затваря групата на минус, а това минус представлява 20-30% от печалбата до момента. Какво настройки, за да се даде да няма отрицателен резултат за група. Поздравления Може ли да публикувате някои снимки на екрани на експерти влизат снимки и набор файл? This is a group with a negative result. There are many such cases for groups with over 6 operations. I tried it just one level with countless 300-distance operations, but the result is still the same.

ПОМОГНЕ? Може ли някой да ми помогне, като ми каза - защо, когато имам повече от 6 операции в една група ... може ли да публикувате екрана с настройки? I'm sorry but I do not remember the settings, I've done hundreds of tests for different purposes. Try Eur / $ with 0.02 on 1 level with 300 and 555 operations and all other levels are zero and total profits = 5, all others at default.I'm writing this because it did not let me upload the settings and photos files.

Hi Joan I have some drawings, but Forex factory does not support format. Can I mail it to you?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I will try to Explain it step by step though, in the mean while. I will use my own settings, but settings must be adjustable. Step1: EA opens a buy and a sell. Both at .01 Step2: Martain Gail for losing trade Grid must go up to 20 far. Set grid size at 40 pips. Increase .01,.01,.01,.03,.06,.09,.12,.15,.18,.21,.24,.27,.30,.33,.36,.39,.42,.45,.48,.51 (TP must follow trades and must take a TP of 2 pips per trade) Step3: Momentum for winning grid Must go 50% of Losing grid 20 pips. Increase 1,2,4,8,16,32,62,128,256,512,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10 (the reason for 10 lot sizes is that some brokers don't accept more than 10 lot sizes when trading Gold) The trade takes a 75% trailing stop between the last open trade and the new trade. After you code it I will help you further with the settings.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi Joancb, With your EA it is always good to have a little risk calculator in excell. It is important to note how much of a grid your EA can handle. It is dangerous to say that your EA survived Brexit, because it depends on how much money were in your trading account. I am not trying to be critical, but just want to share my knowledge and seeing that you are a coder I might consider using you in future. If you traded your EA according to your risk parameters with out a proper retracement, you would need $614 for your first 6 trades(120 pips), up to $7414 if you did not have a retracement yet for your next 5 trades. But that would have given you a risk grid of 620 pips. With most currencies 300 pips is quite safe so with your EA it is about 2880$. If you traded Gold last year, there was a run for 700pips so in extreme conditions it could wipe your account. It is also important to know your currencies when trading MG. Your JPY pairs is runners and you want ti stay away from them. Your AUDNZD EURCHF and a couple other is very small grids and you will probably not make so much trades as with others. If I look at your grid size some of your GBP pairs should be fine some USD and AUD and CAD crosses. But the best way to find the best pairs for your EA is still to load a couple on a Demo account and test them over a period. I dont believe in backtesting as it does not reflect true spreads at that moment. Thank You for your blog it is really informative and I hope that all of you guys find the perfect EA. I know that I am close, but it must still be tested. Maybe I share the final results with you guys in a month or two.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
dear Lucky123 , thank you for sharing your ideas, i find it very interesting, and i would like to know more on your systems, and about the drawings you mentioned. could you email me : mercilez@gmail.com ? i hope you can complete your EA and systems soon. stay green and happy pipping always

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I would also like to join here being a fan of MG i remember i used Blessing EA from JTA today it is free to try there thisis the one i find really the best . I recentlly again made lossess using MG .but i was on social trading site my leader was using MG and i was follower.Ok i will test this and post the results. Thanks

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Joan if I help you, will you write the other half of the EA according to your Little MG and share the code with me? I understand your EA and with a little coding we can get the enhancements done. I have other programmers working on it, but the multiplier in your ea interests me.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Yes go ahead, tomorrow on London open I'll start on this new idea. I would recommend turn off all GBP pairs due to the UK elections. cheers!

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Just explain: Profit 40.0 is that for every open trade after your TP were hit. First principle: When is your buy or sell trades direction confirmed? Answer: When the 2nd buy or 2nd sell opens &gt; Very important . Lets call them a Winning trade and a losing trade. Second Principle: Winningtrade is trading in the correct direction in a grid accumalating trades and lots, untill it retraces to hit Stop Loss or Trailing Stop. Losingtrade is the Martain Gail. (This you have) Third Principle: Your winning trade Stop Loss only opens after the 2nd trade opens and must be a % of the grid between the last 2 openings. Fourth Principle: If Winningtrade went up and retraces, hit SL, reopens, but retraces further, it can also become a losing trade. Now you will have 2 losing trades, untill 1 TP are hit.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Lucky, Here is a preliminary attempt of the EA, there is still no SL nor trailing stop. Please tell me if the lot sizes and space between orders are correct. I've noticed that with pairglobalprofit set to 5 works pretty well as it is now. cheers!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
What do you think about making a global TP(must include 3 profit per open order) for the losing trade. So open 1.0000, 1.0040, 1.0080... This will give you 1.000+1.0040+1.0080/3 =1.0040 - 9 = 1.0031 TP. The calculation includes all losing trades divided by the amount of open trades plus your profit. Include auto spreads. Winning trades just move Stop Loss to the 75% of opened trade. 1.0000 when 1.0020 open Stoploss for both trades move to 1.0015. Next trade opens at 1.0040 Stoploss for all trades move to 1.0035. Next trade opens at 1.0060 Stop loss for all trades opens at 1.0055.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I think for now let 2 run individually with own TP and SL. I must say I am quit impressed with you speed. I really like what I see.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
When I trade EA the space win opens for both the Winning and losing trade.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...1&amp;d=1494907464 Leave this as losing trade(let TP be 30 per open trade). Just add winning trade with 2 multiplier and own grid and 75% SL.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Thanks, very promising. Could you please share mq4 for this version. Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi, Joancb would you please modify profit to profit = OrderProfit() + OrderSwap()+OrderCommission()?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi, That's a new version with StopLoss added, inputs: win_multi is the multiplier for the winning trades lots looselotsum is the number of lots that will add to the previous losing trade profitpercent is the % of the trailing StopLoss is this completed? if not what is the next step? cheers! P.s:There are some 130 error that don't affect the trading algorithm and will be addressed later

--- 帖子 #139 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...06#post9947306 Perhaps the answer to your prayers PS guys, when you make this EA ...you will because it works WAY better than martingale... please post the mql source code here and PM me Cheers

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Updated post#1 As my broker don't have swaps nor commissions I couldn't test it properly, if you find any bug please report it back and I'll be happy to correct it. cheers!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi, Ill do it when I finish the QuinNomLiPoso EA. thanks for sharing your ideas

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I am impressed. There is a hick up when the winningtrade takes profit. It should re-open the original steps. Transaction Time Lot Take Profit USDJPY 1 SELL 13.43 .01 1 13.44 This part is correct SELL 13.44 .02 1 13.44 Re-opens Sell 13.44 .04 2 13.49 It should have re-opened the original 1 Sell 13.49 .08 2 13.49 Re-opens Sell 13.49 .04 Still open Sell 13.54 .04 Still Open Sell 13.54 .08 Still Open The Buy opened 13.43 .01 The losing trade should Multiply less than winning trade. There is also no Take Profit on the losing trade. 13.48 .04 Otherwise its looking great.$$$$$$$$$

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I can see if the trade reverses that the opposite side TP appears. This is cool.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Can we make the losing side .01 straight through. for now or to set it with a multiplier, but the first 3 trades must stay .01.. let it Break even with 30 points profit.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Cheers. we'll have to decide what to do after each profit.... my suggestion is simply go up the scale(fib sequence) then back down the scale(fib sequence).... until you are at 1 lot again... hope that makes sense so every time we have a string of wins we maximize our profits

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Send you email with pictures. Lets recap some principles. Winningtrade starts 1 and multiply X and say there is 5 trades opens it will take profit at 75% between the 4 and 5 trade. If it take profit it will re-open the original buy or sell which ever it was at .01. ( Currently the first trade works, but then does its own thing) If that trades retraces further and not continue its run it must adhere to the losing rules.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Losing trade must with every opening calculate the Breakeven + 3 pips profit per trade open. The winning and losing trade must have there own exit points.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
hi joancb thanks for your EA.i have a question,what is the difference between the EA in post 1 and this EA here? regards Fred

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Trading for 4 hours. The line is not right yet. But made 295 dollars for 4 hour. Must get the line right. Believe that can blow up account eventually.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Am i missing something with your MG. The EA opened buy.01 then buy .04 and then buy .02. The same with the sell. This is a perfect trapper situation. Red line top or redline bottom. I think that it should open .01, .02. .04..... There is no winning trade, but 2 losing trades. Looks great.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
This one I think should have a .01 buy and a .01 sell

--- 帖子 #152 ---
This one looks fine. Just waiting for TP or stoploss to be confirmed.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Dont understand why the different amounts. Would like to see 1 2 4 8 16 32 for winning trade and 1 1 1 3 6 9 12 for losing trades (or multiply 2 on winning trade and 1.5 on losingtrade.)

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Change loose sum from .03 to .01. Does that mean losing trades will go like this. (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) If I am right . I like. This will be losing trade settings. Like a lot if I am right. Or if I make it .00 will that mean it will stay at .01.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Look at profit for 5 hours. Still must get some little problems fixed.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Great work Joan and also great idea`s Lucky Lucky what pairs did you trade in the 4 hrs ? and wil you tell you`re settings ? Many thanks and keep up the good work Greetings

--- 帖子 #157 ---
At this stage I am testing different settings. I am testing so am trying to make grid as small as possible. Different settings for different Currencies. But what I do not understand is that JoanCB EA does some ,magic, which i dont understand yet. GBP JPY in big draw down, Suddenly it closes,

Looks like the pair global profit of 5$ kicked in minus spreads . If I am right. Very smart.

Have you ever thought about this. Double your account 10 times. 1000-2000-4000-8000-16000-32000-64000-128000-256000-512000-1000000. Now the most important things is the period. If you make 100% per day you can be a million dollars strong in 10 days. Last year I did 100% per month and double my account twice. 3000-6500-15000. So i did it two times I just needed another 8 times. But the idee to do it in 10 months and with MG on one side is to nerve wrecking. I made a couple of mistakes, but the USA interest rates killed me. The idee with the 2 functional EA is to do just that. If anyone have a n EA with the potential that can grow that much without blowing your account, i would like to help with choosing the right currencies. Its only 20% about the money, but its more about the challenge. I think the challenge and design of the EA should do just that. JoanCB EA made 500$(3000$ account) in a 8 hours, but is it safe the way I am using it know. I dont think so as I am trading small grid and am trying to put the EA under pressure. For testing purposes.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi Fred, the EA in post 1 is the EA based on my ideas and other people colaborating in this thread and the EA here is based on Lucky123 ideas. cheers!

--- 帖子 #168 ---
It is not OK! still using OrderProfit().

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Morning After. Made some changes to settings 600$ in profit. change settings of .03 to .01 and 0.00. less risk.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hi Lucky, Could you pls share your set up? Tks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Bergax, It doesn't make much sense to me right now because due the different lot sizes you could be winning pips but loosing money and vice versa. Maybe you could elaborate your idea a little more. cheers!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Hey Lucky, interesting EA. Which time frame do you use?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
hi I used: OrderProfit()+OrderSwap()-OrderCommission(); is your commission positive or negative cheers!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Joancb Can we set Global profit only to kick in when a certain amount of losing trades are open. We want the winning trade to run when the market is running to ultimate profit. So say we have a brexit scenario you want to make 60000$ for the run. We might even consider some increase of stop loss every 3 open trades.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Nice Results Lucky

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Or if it closes at 5$ it should automatically run there after. So as long as there is less than 2 losing trades open the EA should not take global profit in consideration.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
This is your results JoanCB. You are the coder. I just give the idee.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
It is not time frame dependant, but I use the 1 min for my testing. Especially if I make the grid small.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi, do you guys talk about the EA on the 1st or 7th page? :-)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
@Lucky, hi Lucky, How many Pairs you use it? and is OrderModifyError doesn't effect to your EA Work?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
You could add an MM feature that looks at the account size and places trades according to percentage of account. :-)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
OIC, you have to use + OrderCommission(). Thank you!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
hi, joancb now the grid is fixed + CCI in the EA by setting. I would like to try some other trigger: Sell: Close[1] &gt; Open[1] &amp;&amp; Close[0] &lt; Low[1] Buy: Close[1] &lt; Open[1] &amp;&amp; Close[0] &gt; High[1] EA will depend on TF.

Hello Joancb, I'm enjoying this thread very much, appreciate your work and lucky123 ideas, and wish all of MG, hedge and grid trading fans the most success. I just want to make a suggestion, if it's possible, to create a thread for each EA, cause it's really difficult to follow or suggest new ideas to the different EA's cause it's all mixed up. Nevertheless, If that's not possible I'll continue to follow up. Thanks for your work, good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
OMG Joan, what are you doing with this version? lol.. the upgrade Looks great on tested! can you add comment for Total Profit that has been closed, so we know which pair that has good result, so from that information we can try to push up the setting of EA.. thx,

1 l 1 l 2 l 3 l 5 l 8 l 13 l 21 l 34 l 55 l 89 ... if 99%? of the time you will not lose more than 10 in a row... that is 232 maximum micro lots that could be lost if you lose the 11 in a row....or 2.32 full lots if you potential loss by using the fibonacci sequence compare to the martingale 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 =2047 potential losses in a row or 20.47 full lots! YIKES! martingale is full of greed... More than Ten Times the loss there Just Musing Let's not be greedy!

Hi Nigpig Profit so far for one day.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Is it perhaps an idea, to get a total profit a day. I mean for example that you can enter for example € 25 a day And if you've achieved your goal, the ea turns itself off. The series of results minus the outstanding orders must then be greater than € 25, - If the EA restarts he starts again with the lower lotsize I think this is better for the margin and lowers a big draw down. This can with both EA `s I think this will work great and especially when you`re working with more then one pair. Greetings and keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Lucky, Could you show your setfile for EUR/USD as I am struggling to find profitable settings in a backtest. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Lucky123 Great name! :-) Yes could you send us a set file? Tell us what you look for in the settings? Would be helpful..

--- 帖子 #205 ---
If you tell me where to get the set file I will send it to you. Currently I loaded on GBPUSD EURUSD GBPAUD USPJPY GBPJPY EURJPY XAUUSD. I am testing and started on 2774$ account. I am not fully happy yet, but if you can give ideas that will be good. Originally the losesum was on .03, but i changed to 0.00. GBPUSD i trade 50.00 and 100.00. EURUSD 30.00 and 60.00 GBPAUD 100 and 200 USDJPY 100 and 200 eurjpy 100 and 200 XAUUSD 150 and 300. Remember i am just testing and try to figure out stuff. My original idea was to have the winning grid 50% smaller than the losing grid and my lot increases to the winning side 2 times 1,2,4,8 with a 75% TP on the last two open trades. The losing trade I know leave on .01. Pair global must sort them out. But in back testing it does not work. To make the EA make fast money you must try and decrease the grid, but still protect theee oooother side. I am now thinking of making the losing grid 3 to 4 times bigger with acceleration. But you must always keep Fibo in consideration so maybe increasing 1,3,7,10,13,14,17,20,..... So I am still a bit stuck..

Hi, is it possible for this martingale to work within a price range (e.g.: Start:144.00, End:142.00) so that if it touches these values then the EA is deactivated and any open or pending trades are closed immediately. Thank you in advance.

Nice work! And I am a fan of weekly Pivot level trading. Like this: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=588764 If we only start martingale after the price reaches 78 (setting) S or R level of weekly pivot. It would increase winning rate.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Ok, you can just save the set file on your desktop. Press save on the inputs section of your EA.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
hii can u tell me what setting are using and which verion thankyou

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Joancb Look at graph Buy 1271, 1276,1281, and 1286 Breakeven should be at 1278.5 + profit for MG. 1281 but yours is at 1291. I see that it moved down to 1284 after it started retracing, but why is it not doing it as the trades opens. Also if 75% SL are hit all winning trades must close.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
The EA is not right let us first fix then do opto

--- 帖子 #216 ---
i cannot keep up with all these versions , im lost lol. it seems a nice EA so far, making money consistently , so far dont see it taking big lots or i was just lucky or market didnt create the need? im using all majors on M1. im testing v 1.4 and v 11 so far , default settings

--- 帖子 #217 ---
13 years backtest, 20 pairs...don't work. Believe me.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
you might be right. problem is backtests are really useless

--- 帖子 #220 ---
version v1.11 did 409 € (euros) profit since June 2, default settings , 6 major currency pairs 1 M tf

--- 帖子 #221 ---
In my opinion I don't think Martingales work all the time. if you just leave it switched on, sooner or later you will blow your account. However, if you have a strategy already that you use and you have a bias towards the trend direction, then temporarily you could use this to bank more profit. You could have this EA work within a Range between the Stop Loss and the Take Profit. If any of these touch then you can have the EA switch off immediately and close all the trades. Hence the reason for asking for someone to code in a price range.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Forward tests are useless too, if backtest don't work. Don't waste your time. Ciao.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hi Joan we need to close all winning trades when SL are reach, but what is the possibility to have it trail from the first SL opening. On the chart you see the spikes up. we need to capture that. I can start to optomize and send settings through after that. I made 30% on day two of trading, but i know it can do better.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Optomize as EA is GBPUSD 1/3/2017 to 31/5/2017 1000$ account. Will look further into that settings on GBPUSD. But I like trading multiple currencies, normally un correlated, sometimes 2.

Hello, Demo or Real account?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
i noticed so far in more than 2 weeks testing i havent seen the margin go below 320 %. i use 6 pairs on M1 for the test but initial investment balance is relatively low, 1200 euros . so i think thats a good sign. also i havent noticed any trade over 0.12 so far. and that is super good is there a maximum trade that the EA will take with default settings? Please let me\us know profit in one week 550 euros on 6 pairs, 1 M tf , default settings, v.11 , see statement 1 week for this version. i have the v1.4 running too and very good results on that too also on another vps i started a test with v.12, same pairs, same timeframe and it made 209 euros in one night (mostly on gbp\usd), simply amazing and the max lot taken was 0.12....again my question is 0.12 the max lot that the EA will take or it s just a coincidence?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
martingale usually will trade small size... until it gets too large

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Dear Lucky, I have been reading about your Martingale+Momentum strategy. It seems very difficult for programmers to program. As such, would like to suggest a simplified version. Do you think it will work? Afterall, the aim is to make money. In essence, it will not have individual takeprofit, but will only close all position when both buy and sell EA is making money.

Thats fine , but that still doesn't answer my question. Is there a max lot that this EA would take? Anyone?

hii all friend which verion are u using i am doing on first post can u help me what lateast verion so its help me testing and suggestion u

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi, Just Ideas, calculate the average volatility of each pair, for 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, is up to you, with this data we can set which pair that This EA can handle to resilience of capital, for ex. when the UK Election, GBPCAD, GBPJPY, that pairs have a Big Big Volatility that we cant calculate, but like EURGBP, GBPUSD, thats work Fine, i Used UnomGuai V1.12, with default setting, and its work great, so, thats just my suggest, by the way, where is joan, I miss him, lol

--- 帖子 #235 ---
No max lot size from the codes.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
ok thats not good in my opinion. it must be rare i guess because it hasnt happened more than 0.12 or i have just been lucky

QuiNom V1.1 with default setting

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi Joan What broker are you using with no spreads and no commission.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
did I said no spreads? LOL I wish I meant no swap nor commission it is fortfs. cheers!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
thanks Joan, not a coder here , i appreciate your help. this EA at first glance seems good and i ve tested many

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Sorry my bad, you did say swaps.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
hi joan can the EA turn off the logging, it generated every second

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Live testing v1.1 right now. Update later! Both v1 and v12. Default settings.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Sure, open the EA with the mql editor and delete the line(s) where it says Print("OT: ",etc,etc....); cheers!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi Joan The EA is not opening the way it should. There is suppose to be 2 buys and 1 sell. But it opened an extra buy on the sell.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Can someone please help.. I pasted the ex4 and mql4 files on the expert folder, but i could not find it in the trade terminal.. can someone please help..

--- 帖子 #250 ---
close\restart or refresh mt4 , it will appear in the navigator tab on the left, attach to chart

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I am really getting no success in back testing i tried different setting and ways can you pls guide how to use qui(EA as per your idea)sorry if I wrote something wrong.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
of course you will crash with those settings. thats 0.1 initial lot and too low balance for that.....

--- 帖子 #253 ---
If a strategy can't survive in the long run (5-6 years) then what does it mean to have that strategy in the first place?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
a solution i see with martingale EAs s is to withdraw constantly the profits and leave initial balance untouched or just with some extra . lets say your initial balance is 2000 $ and your constant profits(that you withdrew to a subaccount) amount to 2000 $. now you re breakeven even if you lose all the initial balance and that doesnt necessarily have to happen often. leaving a lot of money in the account where EA is placed is good because you have more margin but also riskier because if you have a bad streak you lose it all 1)find a good EA (this one seems good) 2)put a decent initial balance 3) withdraw profits to a subaccount (these are free with any broker) 4)profit constantly we ll see if that works lol

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Just put my deposit on 2000,- as you suggested and tested in strategy tester with 0,01 lots.. What ever currency all always blow up my account. Within weeks.. Not sure what I do wrong? An idea I had is to add a kind of hedge after X position to avoid big drawdowns..

--- 帖子 #256 ---
are you also talking about this EA? this for me so far minimal drawdown and equity attached to balance (or almost)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Did you backtest it in strategy tester? Which settings do you use?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
backtesting never worked for me, lol i said it in other posts. somtimes some systems gave me amazing results in backtesting for 1 year and they failed the 2 nd day.... recently i only trust what i see, that is forward test (demo or live). i know it may seem extreme but thats how i think now but ask others here i use only a pure ECN broker (commissions + swaps + very low spread), its worth it, peace of mind and no conflict of interest

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Here. 01.04.2017 - 18.05.2017. Every tick test 90% accuracy. Account wiped out. Default settings of UnNomGuaiV1.12.ex4

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Luca1073, that is very good advice that you have given to withdraw the profits. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
you know what everybody should do? let a forward test run for 2 weeks- 1 month , then stop the test and go into strategy tester and test the same period, same condition on one pair and see what happens. you might realize the backtests results are completely different from your real forward test. it happend to me a few times. also on strategy tester you have to test with fixed spread(number 10 is 1 pip), if you test on current spread during the weekend while market is closed spread is huge(even 6 pips on eur \usd). my ecn broker has 0.4 pips spread on eur\usd also on strategy tester you cannot test two or more pairs together

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Will do this ! :-)

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi dont apologise. I did some backtesting and certain settings is better than other. Currently the EA is not opening the way it should. The other thing with EA and backtesting. Most EA should not be traded during News. Because of the increase of spreads and volatilty. This is something you would not see on your backtesting. Every currency is different and different settings should be used on different currencies. When we get the EA right I would probably look at winning trade 400 and losing trade 500 and multiply 1 loosesum0.00 ang global profit 0.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I agree, 1) is to become risk free 2) Keep on withdrawing 50% of profit 3) grow your account to reduce the risk and to earn more every day.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi Joan, i wanted to ask you a couple of questions if you have time to answer 1) since when have you traded "Un Nom Guai" on a live account? (on the myfxbook screenshot that you showed it appears since april 2017, is that correct? 2) are you still using the original first version on this live account now? Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hi joan, this is my summary from my real Account.. i must say, im impressed! i use every suggest that you give, and i've always Upgrade the EA from UnOmGuaiV.1.1 to V1.12!! of course with a little change in the setting, but overall this EA is awesome! the Only Big News that happened, is UK Election, but on GBPUSD and EURGBP this EA works fine.. on GBPJPY, GBPCAD, GBPCHF I dont know, I didnt trade in that pair coz of the volatility.. oh by the way, Happy Holiday Joan, and thank you for your Work! i'll be wait for your next Upgrade, and ill keep suggest a little ideas if it can help, Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
So you attach the ea and leave it? What deposit you must have? 1000€ is ok? I will attach it in my demo account on Monday to see how it will go. In a post I saw you have myfxbook Can you send the link in order to examine it more? Do you stop the ea in big events like Britain election on Thurday?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Simply fantastic, well done, happy for your results! Can I ask you what pairs are you trading and what settings are you using? are you each time changing/ putting the last updated version? from what i understood timeframe is not an issue with this EA

--- 帖子 #269 ---
care to share your settings? =)

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Awesome!! Can you share the set files for the settings? I would like to test it for the comming weeks.. :-)

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi, Wondering which broker are you using? They give deposit bonus? Is the spread high? Usually brokers with deposit bonus have high spread. I'm using icmarkets (good low spread, no bonus) and XM (50% deposit bonus, super high spread). @ zakgr 1000€ is not ok. Drawdown during good times is already $800. You probably need about $10,000 account size. ALTERNATIVELY, use a nano lot broker. @ unclemonk The default settings is good enough. But can start with 0.01 lots with smaller account size. Additionally, this real account reinforce my understanding that "profit, globalprofit and pariglobalprofit" works mutual exclusively. Just put in profit figure in one of these inputs, and leave the other two zeros. DEFAULT SETTINGS: PAIRGLOBALPROFIT: CLOSE BOTH BUY &amp; SELL OF A SINGLE PAIR EACH TIME IN PROFIT. For example, the default use "pairglobalprofit" so all the currency's pair trades will close everytime it is profitable. The account, as a result will always have negative floating P/L, so "globalprofit" can never truly kicks in. SAFEST SETTINGS: GLOBALPROFIT: CLOSE ALL CURRENCY PAIRS EACH TIME IN PROFIT. Safest because have a bundle of trades to minimize the fluctuation. But lowest profit. MOST PROFITABLE SETTINGS: PROFIT: CLOSE TRADES OF EVERY BUY / OR SELL SERIES EACH TIME THEY ARE IN PROFIT. This has the largest negative floating P/L, but is the most profitable. Adds most to equity the fastest. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I was thinking about a safety lock that could be added . example EA should be coded to avoid taking trades after margin has fallen below 250 % (just giving a number here , it could be modified in settings) what do you think? it would be to give a bit more safety to the smaller accounts? also so far i havent had trades for more than 0.12 and that was fine with only 1200 eur account, margin never went below 300 % on 6 pairs!! and we had some big movement these days. what was your biggest lot trade taken by the EA so far in your case guys? on v.11 default settings i have a whopping 700 eur + profit on 6 major pairs since june 2 starting from a 1200 eur (now balance is over 1900) Maximalloss in settings is related to initial balance? for example we start the EA with 3000 $ and we set as maximal loss 500 $. when the total account balance goes below 2500 $ the EA will stop trading? or is it related to equity?(dont think so).also it could be done related to equity sorry for all the questions lol but i like this EA

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Kelvinyun, If i attach the ea to only 1 pair do you think i will be ok with 1000€?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Just went through a thread on FF that discusses Martingale. Someone there attached a nice mixed martingale + grid + hedge trading statement. See attachment.. It seems the trader had 4 martingale steps and hedged the 5th step. A good suggestion from a forum member was to hedge after the 4th position example: buy: 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.8 sum 1.5 lots buy orders when the last 0.8 buy order is executed, execute a 1.7 lot sell order diff is now 0.2 sell lots, stop executing new orders (max orders =5) now you stopping further drawdowns, you have time to decide: - waiting if the markets is falling further, the hedge sell will equal all buy orders - waiting and exit at the lowest possible loss on all buy+sell orders - if the market reverses and is going up, close all at the lowest possible loss (not sure how to exit though) What do you guys think? Is there a way to use this for the EA?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Interesting EA, can i know which time frame is best for this

--- 帖子 #276 ---
author said timeframe is not important unless you use the CCI indicator in settings. im using M1, it works well so far

--- 帖子 #277 ---
if you set openonewcandle to true, then he opens just one trade a candle the timeframe is also important then. When you get big red news and he will moves a lot he just takes one trade a candle. Greetings

--- 帖子 #278 ---
yes its true, in settings i left it default, openonewcandle to false, thats why didnt think about it

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I'm running on cent account which have capital USDC 2000 with default settings. But order sets seems closing below the profit target of 5. is that possible. I attached a one screen shot of order bulk

--- 帖子 #280 ---
The above order set closed with lose even remain default profit target.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Don't try this with real money, are you crazy? M1 my god...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
It just a cent account with $20, no worries

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Who do you mean by this comment?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Just now i put the ea in demo account to see how it will go. Settings to default 3 pairs only Eurusd,usdjpy,usdchf Do you stop the ea before red news? If yes, you close all trades with loss for example?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Mean, long term (10+ years), martingale don't work, even M1.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
My "INSANE RISK" system/EA +500% (martingale) 10k deposit. My "INSANE RISK II" system/EA - 100% (martingale) 10k deposit It's not unlucky, martingale don't work, long term, simply, forward test (demo or live) done. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Who the hell would let a Martingale run for 10+ years ? Of course it will crash, it's a martingale ! Event though i'm relatively new to dealing with EAs, I could at least understand that much. Martingale EAs don't work for a long time, yes, but that's just not how you make constant profit with them ! You have to withdraw your profits on a regular basis, leave only the amount of your initial deposit on the account, and monitor the EA to be able to stop it on red news if needed. The point is to have a martingale that makes enough profit, and to withdraw constantly for your balance to stay low enough, so that when your account crashes (and again, it will crash), you've made enough profit to cover the loss, and still have profit left. You can't just let it run for years on forward test OR Backtest, it just won't work. That aside, This looks like an interesting EA, i'm going to test it on demo account and see if it works, but from the results on the thread it looks promising, so thanks Joancb for sharing !

--- 帖子 #288 ---
QuinNomLiPosoTest v1.2.mq4 MG is like putting weight on one side. What I am trying to do with this EA is to balance it out with Momentum. With MG you will eventually blow your account. There is no winning MG EA on the market that I know of. Hedging is a temporary solution, but also a MG strategy. If you can have a more agressive strategy on your winning side and a less agressive strategy on your losing side(MG) you can minimize your risk. This EA entry, currently is not working correctly. I am sure that it will reduce the risk tremendously. Last Year I also thought that I can not lose untill I got a 700 pip move. You see When you accumulated 15000$ from a 3000$ account and then lose it in 2 weeks. That can make you sick. This is the reason I am trying to help you guys. Never to feel the way I felt. When you in the beginning have a 7000$ account draw down, but you ask yourself. Should I stay in or will it trade itself out. You risk 15000$ or 8000$, Guess what i did. I withdrew my original 3000$ and lost the account. Do not just trade MG. Have a risk calculator. Make sure you can easily manage a 400pip drawdown.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
So, you run a martingale EA (this) only for 2-3 month and widthdraw (if you are in profit), but if you are in loss what you do?! This is gambling, not trading...you know this? This EA is interesting EA of course (little martingale), but put 2k real money for withdraw 2k to profit (risking a lot, this is a martingale) it's a dream, for me. :-) Again, good luck.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Yes 10 yrs is a long time for any system and martingale is risky anyway and everybody knows. If it was good for 10 yrs "only" it would the martingale grail Lol aside from jokes thanks for your opinion , im usually cautious too with things and am not jumping to conclusions good or bad. So far between the martingale systems that i ve seen this seems one of the nicest. Secret is to withdraw often all the profits constantly to have less risks. Of course if you fail at the start its not good. Thanks, grazie e Ciao vedo che sei Italiano anche tu

UnNomGuaiV1.12.ex4 have several bugs which I didn't find out before trading on real. 1) does not open position, sometimes. - a) buy trade with huge negative balance, and there is no sell trade. - b) buy trade with huge negative balance, and there is no subsequent martingale buy trades opened. 2) does not close position, sometimes. This two bugs are real killers on account balance. Additionally, this is not a bug, but is coded into the EA. "space1" "space2"... are accumulative. Eg, by setting the EA to opening trades after a candle opens, is useful to prevent opening too many trades during large news. But because of the accumulative nature, it opens large position very close to each other after the large news. (kinda hard to explain, so hope u guys understand).

--- 帖子 #292 ---
The Martingale I traded last year, could easily manage a move of 250 pips without retracement.(made 100% per month) But you can increase it to 600 pips without retracement. But your profit would be less. This is how you manage it. You switch it off before news. You close it early on Fridays. So it is all about probabilities. You can trade a MG successfully by managing the risk. But greed comes into play. If your risk appetite is lower, you can trade that EA for 10% profit per month. The problem is, I dont trade EA to make 10% per month. I want to make at least 30-50%.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
can i ask you where you found your martingale EA that you were trading? here on forex factory or you purchased it \created yourself. in case could you share it here or give us the link? im curious. its ok if you cant, thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I will be able to give you details. I do not want to at this moment as I asked the developer to make some changes to it. I do not want people to trade it the way I stressed. As soon as he made the changes I will tell you. I first will test.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi Lucky, Just like luca, as I asked before, I'm also really interested in your previous EA. I was wondering if you could share more details. Cheers

--- 帖子 #296 ---
ok Thanks Lucky!!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Interested as well :-)

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Also are you still working on (testing) QuinNomLiPosoTest v1.2.ex4 ? I keep thinking how to reduce risk with hedging and other strategies..

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I am waiting for Joan to come back from holiday. He need to make some changes.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
The martingale I'm using could sustain a 600 pip movement easily. Just use a 1H or 4H chart. Winning trades can open as much as it wants. Losing trades needs to wait until 1H or 4H (candle opens) before it can open a subsequent trade. Joan's EA can also sustain these moves easily. Problem is, I don't know the codes well enough to remove those bugs (not opening / not closing).

--- 帖子 #301 ---
i want to show you this screenshot, i dont know if this is normal. this is a usd\cad trade. i have the impression that the martingale sequence was interrupted and after 0,12 of buy trades it performs a sell trade at 0.02. is this normal. this is on v4 (an old version&gt;) but still would like to know your opinion. see screenshot if its supposed to be like that then it may be actually safer, lol

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Can you code

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Your EA can manage 600 pip. What is your profit % per month?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
hey lucky123, just backtested the ea, seems pretty neat. but i got a question for you, does the ea result has anything to do with the mt4 timeframe? because i tested on 1m and 1h timeframe, it came out different result. i thought martingale strategy should have nothing to do in what timeframe you trade in? thanks.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
See the results when it working properly. You can not rely on backtesting for profit. Spreads in real life are different. You can test your settings, but it does not guarentee Live results. I believe you should have a good strategy and you should be able to calculate your risk seperately. I use a excell sheet to manage the risk. You then know that if a move say 300pip happens i will blow my account. With MG your whole account is at risk. Or you can say what is the chances that it will make a say 300 pip move without 38% retracement. This nomlipiso is an EA where we try to reduce the MG risk by adding momentum on the other side. You see, the smaller your grid, the bigger your profits. So the guys playing it safe does not make the same profit than the smaller grids. But the smaller grids blow up more accounts than THE BIGGER GRIDS. By adding momentum We are trying to reduce the risk to have a risk free trade, to make faster profits. This is a continous balancing act. Nothing in forex works forever and the only way of getting things done is by experiencing it yourself. Understanding the EA you are working with is crucial.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
ya i have to agree with you. martingale is a method for fast recovery just in case the position go against our will. thanks for your input.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
i noticed same situation of the screenshot i showed above also on the first version shared by Joan(un nom guai v1). after several buy trades in MG sequence taken by the EA on usd\cad it takes a sell at 0.02 lots. it happened after a sequence of buy trades culminating with a 0.12 lot trade. thats why i wasnt getting more than 0.12 lots? but on another version (i think v11) i saw a 0.18 lot today on 2 pairs that approached margin risk in % (due to te relatively low balance)

--- 帖子 #308 ---
yes i suspect there are bugs in all versions. in v11 on usd\cad 0.18 lot is taken but the first lots are spaced between each other not respecting the distance in pips ( in settings) thats my impression

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Apparently the big move up of all CAD pairs was caused by one member of the bank of Canada who said yesterday that the bank could raise interest rates sooner than planned. result? Little martingale EA started trading bigger lots lol. Infact there was a consistent drop on usd/cad without retracement when i checked last time

--- 帖子 #310 ---
My coding skills are pretty limited. Small adjustment is ok, but when its complicated, then I can't do it. 600 pip drawdown no problem. Starting capital USD 2,000 Starting Lots 0.01 Martingale Factor 1.5 or 1.6 Return about USD800 per month. 6 major pairs. It was working well for over a year, until Brexit. Survived Brexit, but didnt make it to the second wave of pound flash crash (which they say is fat fingers). Now I'm reluctant to use it, as it needs 3 months to recoup the capital. Yesterday, I started on a nano account ( FBS ), running them on 19 pairs. Starting capital USD500. Wanted to run on all pairs, but somehow the EA don't run on some pairs. Starting size is 0.005 lots. Just realized i made a mistake. Should have used starting size of 0.0005 lots instead. But it too late to change now. Hope it can survive for two weeks. Cos it's yielding 10% yesterday. So two weeks, then it's capital withdrawal.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Let me\us know if you want to share it, we'll test it too about the gbp\usd flash crash maybe you refer to october? that looked like an algo went crazy in some dark building somewhere

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Why you did not stop your ea as voting for brexit was coming?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I always agree with you for sharing or at least introducing good EAs . Let's help each other

--- 帖子 #314 ---
can someone explain why there is always open one opposite trade, is that for reduce the risk or have another use of it

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Over confidence. It has been doing wonders for a year. Gotten too confident that it can tackle anything. After Brexit it already lost USD800 out of USD2000 capital. Thought the worst was over, until the pound flash crash. The EA is not mine to give. It's made by a friend, and he's selling it for a hefty sum. But anyway, it works nearly identical to Joan's EA. Joan has several improvement over it, such as being able to manually set the "space" thus Joan's yield is much higher for similar amount of risk. Now we just have to remove those bugs of not opening orders and not closing orders. Additionally the codes need fixing to remove accumulative trade sequence as explained more below: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I found that there are several trade orders (EURUSD) opened and closed immediately at 10:59:41 -10:59:47 as per the attached screen capture. (you can see the Screen.docx for clearer detail) Is this the bug?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi to all I need a little help I have attached the ea to a demo account The ea has opened 1 buy and 1 sell at start. As the price went down, the ea opened one buy trade every 10pip It made this 3 times with lots 0.03 0.05 0.08 Then it stopped. Shouldn't have made more openings? for example to continue 0.12 0.18 ect? Is there any setting that I must change? I use the default setting as I downloaded for the first post If any could explain?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I think i got it For the first 40 pips it opens a trade every 10 pips After that will open every 500 pips then 1000 ect They are in the options I use the default option as i dowloaded Does anybody has some different setting to propose?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
The EA trade in both directions. As the Martingale loses and try to retrace, the other side is still open.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Think about it....Why would you sell an EA that actually made money. Common sense says take the code and run...

--- 帖子 #322 ---
yes correct but i noticed it open sells also during the fall. Example we got to a buy 0.12 trade and then instead of taking a buy 0.18 trade (as price goes against us) it takes a 0.02 sell trade (sort of like hedging). Is that normal Lucky?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
You have found a different bug. See the whole list of trades without profit. that's not supposed to happen Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Yup, that's why he just distribute it to friends and family for free. Selling for super expensive sum to deter potential buyers. But anyway, it's martingale. All martingales are similar. They all burst one day. That's why I say we better find those bugs in Joan's and remove them, because the "space" "space" is quite good to achieve higher yield during ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
the bug\s present in the first versions (at least up to v1.4) helped the EA survive so far on my demo test with smaller account on 6 pairs , default settings (1200 euros initial deposit, now over 2000). infact the max lot taken by the EA is 0.12, then an opposite trade for 0.02 is taken instead of the continuing martingale sequence. i suspect this bug is present in the original version v1. i wonder if Joan shared a different version here or he didnt notice because v1 and v4 seems to have similar attitudes. all my tests with default settings on v11 and v12 blew up (margin stop out) except for a ranging pair test on 5 pairs. for a smaller account is probably still possible to trade this EA but the bug Must be officially left there lol im anyway convinced that for 1200 euro account 0.12 lots is really the max that the EA should take any opinion?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Dear Luca, Which pairs did you get better results and seems to be safer during your test?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
difficult to say. most pairs behaved similarly (the 6 forex Major pairs) &amp; in a good way until something happened with CAD that made two pairs behave in a hard trending way without retracement. 0.27 (i think) lots were taken and this destroys any small account

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Many thanks, DO you keep it running even during news time? Isn't it better to turn it off even if you are in small loss?In this case probably small accounts also can survive.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
you re welcome, being demo i left it running during all news to see what would happen. the CAD issue happened outside of news, based on a speech at moderate volatility expected when one member of the bank of canada suggested that canada may raise interest rates earlier than expected....boom....

--- 帖子 #330 ---
again meaningless in the long run.... how? here is a simulation: Initial deposit $2000 Profit $1000 after 10 days &amp; withdraw $1000 Result: Equity $2000 &amp; Profit $1000 [protected in different account] Profit $1000 after 7 days &amp; withdraw $1000 Result: Equity $2000 &amp; Profit $2000 [protected in different account] Profit $1000 after 12 days &amp; withdraw $1000 Result: Equity $2000 &amp; Profit $3000 [protected in different account] Profit $1000 after 15 days &amp; withdraw $1000 Result: Equity $2000 &amp; Profit $4000 [protected in different account] Loss $2000 after 7 days [account blow up] Result: Equity $0 &amp; Profit $4000 [protected in different account] Now, You invest $2000 from your $4000 protected balance &amp; now your reserved balance is $2000 Profit $1000 after 15 days &amp; withdraw $1000 Result: Equity $2000 &amp; Profit $3000 [protected in different account] Loss $2000 after 8 days [account blow up] Result: Equity $0 &amp; Profit $3000 [protected in different account] Now, You invest $2000 from your $3000 protected balance &amp; now your reserved balance is $1000 Now my question in here.... "Where are we going by using this strategy?" Nowhere... eventually our reserved balance which we have separated in different account will finish &amp; we will end up exactly same as we are supposed to

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Haha, well if you put it like this we obviously dont go anywhere. You tell me, how this strategy could be benefited? My question to you. How can this strategy be used / altered to being profitable?

--- 帖子 #332 ---
you might be right. withdrawing profits is more psychological and beneficial if then the EA will work, eventually. you say it wont work? probably, we are here to try and make it work. you have an idea of something that wiil work instead? forex trading is affected by many things and even the simplest strategy may not work. it depends on us and the market. if you leave with a negative approach nothing will ever happen. there are people that try hundreds of strategies on demo and then quit even before starting live because they re scared to lose money and they will invent tons of excuses with themselves not to trade. its fine. perfection definitely doesnt exist in forex (yet) and we are just trying to find that certain edge

--- 帖子 #333 ---
My opinion is if you have a big capital and you trade a few pairs it is difficult to loose. For example if you have 2000-3000 as a capital and you trade only 2-3 pairs, it is difficult to blow the account. The trend won't be over 200-300 pips with no some retrace I have usdjpy in demo account for the start of the week and it has reached 0,27 lots. I think the market will turn in a while. We will see. The martinagle in theory never looses just blows the account because there are no money left to open new trades. Thats my opinion

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hii here all talking about ea but none was share which verison working all just talk but nobody know which verison all using can any help me which veison now using

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Aside from the bugs you guys think that original setting (50 pips ditance between MG trades for the first 5 trades?) is better than v12 settings (only 10 pips) ? im still baffled of how v1 (or v4) is surviving with such a small initial capital on 6 pairs basically stopping martingaling and "going with the trend" at a certain moment. I dont know if its clear i explained it in other posts. Basically the EA after 0.12 will stop martingaling and it will take an opposite trade to the MG sequence at 0.02 . Im sure that that is safer for the margin for sure (not sure about the strategy though lol)

--- 帖子 #336 ---
wow , "yes all talking , none was share? all just talk". i guess google translate is really bad, isn't it? well it has always been like that. incredible that in this techno modern world , such a big company is not yet able to "provide" a good "service" yes we talk , it's a forum. we share opinions. maybe everybody is just waiting for Joan now. i said what i had to say and still have many doubts about the bugs and more. the version we are using is probably v12, v4 or whatever. you arrived now so use the last one, v12. find it in the forum, it doesn't take long to go back in the pages here.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
After examined the ea in many pairs I found out that the ea is going to blow the account if the price don't come back near the point of your first trade. if you see at audusd it is trading up from the start of june. If the price don't go down to 0.7450 the account will blow sooner or later.(if the account is small, if it is big it will remain opend with big losses and wait) The same with usdjpy. On 15/6 (before 2 days) it made an up trend around 150pip . if the price don't go under 110.400 it will be difficult to close the trades and will take time or blow the account. Pairs that ranging like usdchf are good because the prices returns again and quickly Is Joan trading a year? What did he do with these kind of situations? Somewhere I read the he is on vacations? when he will be back to enlight us?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
are these the setting Joan use?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
guys, the author and Luca1073 did mentioned multiple times, this is a martingale EA, which means, eventually blow up is possible on long trend moves. but the there is some way to manage the risk - by withdrawing profit constantly after reach X % , finding the right mix between deposit / risk / grid range / profit rate. how one do it is the secret of successful trading in martingale and i dont think anyone with a good mix would share out openly here. so try to do some homework, spent time to think and test for your own best fit. thank you for the generous sharing of EA joan , and others for contribute info results.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
he said he was using those when he posted the first version in the site

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I good way to start is by optimization, through the strategy tester.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
In continuation to above msg I wish to know how to set stop loss or come out if the long trend continues. Can john or lucky add hedging in this EA. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Its Inevitable to fall...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
i look at your banner below (signature) and i truly see no hope....lol

--- 帖子 #345 ---
LOL haha...

--- 帖子 #346 ---
After some posts he mentioned that he uses other settings more safe but not very profitable. (Make a new trade after 50pips) I backtested those and seemed better. I will test them again in real time on a demo account Anyone backtest audusd for the first of the month and and see : 1.the default settings will blow a small account or have a big DD 2.The safe settings are doing better. Is there anyone useing this ea in live accaount? I have decided that after making some tests the following week(and pass them) to go live but trade only 1-2 pairs in an account with2-4000€ account in order to have much space.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Going live gives you the real feeling and i always encourage it as long as you understand the EA and it seems that you do. The 50 pip safe settings is actually the first settings that he shared (500 points is 50 pips) on v 12 default settings are 100 points or 10 pips that's definitely more risky. An issue with going live is the bugs. What you should do (at least) is to use v12 and change pip distance to 500 (there default is 100)

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Hello! Is it possible to see your open source code?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hedging is a temporary issue, because you must still get out of the hedge.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Losipino is not opening the way it should,

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Well said, i used to like the idea of hedging but it can be as risky as martingale but without the profits lol

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Look well in the thread (some pages earlier i think) . he shared v12 in mq4

--- 帖子 #353 ---
what is your idea about this: https://www.forexfactory.com/dragonexpert

--- 帖子 #354 ---
What is this? What is the stragedy he does not explain

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I am reading your answer again and again and i can not understand what are you talking. Can you please explain me? Is it about a different ea? I saw a different version Jonas made, is it this you are talking about? Are you using it?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
tested it on demo (he wants money for unlocking it for real account) . dragonexpert user even posted on this thread if you go to the first pages here. his EA so far has worked well and made 1100 $ from an initial balance of 5000 $ in a bit less than a month. he uses 3 pairs. there s a martingale component in his EA. im testing lots of stuff these days(i have 10 Vps) so i barely looked at it but it still there and has not been binned and thats not a bad sign lol- EA took some big lots already which i dont like, so far biggest was 0.55

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi Luca123 Unfortunately when I was testing this EA on a demo account it opened up many trades above 1 lot size. I stopped using the EA as waiting for JoanCB to make the the changes.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
i agree with you. it is difficult to understand because of the bug i guess. in his original version tha he shared here :Un Nom Guai (v1) and on V4 basically EA behaves like that: after it takes a 0.12 lot it will take a 0.02 lot(instead of a 0.18 lot) BUT in the opposite direction of the martinglae sequence as if it wanted to hedge. if 0.12 was a buy the next will be 0.02 and only a sell or viceversa. this of course puts up in % the margin and EA has temporarily less chances of getting a margin call, but i supect it is just a bug

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thank You yes its locked but if you can, find the logic from my forward test: Forextime cent demo Login: 15114476 Investor: pubp7is I preffer to add an option of "ReverseTrading" to use Correlated pairs and those pairs neutralize each-other movements. the author says: use 5000$ , 0.01 lot on EU,EJ,UJ simultaneously . I want this combination: EU JE (reverse trade by that option on EJ ) UJ (each currency once in first and once in last letter) (Also I asked from the author) What is your Idea ?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
i will have to download a forextime platform to check your stats. what did the author tell you? as i told you i barely looked at it, anyway will see later, thanks

--- 帖子 #361 ---
In my demo account that tested the ea last week i had a pair (usdjpy) that took a 0,27 trade and did not take the opposite trade you told. Is it a bug only in real accounts?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
im testing only demo for now As i told you this bug seems to be happening only up to version 4 i didnt see this happening on v11 and v12 where higher lots were taken but there were other problems there too

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Thanks for the kind sharing. May I know if the default setting is the best set (for which pair and which timeframe)?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Dears didnt answer me. in case of martingale on 3 correlated pairs (EU,EJ,UJ), Its not better to reverse one of these pairs to make (EU,"JE"(reverseTrading),UJ) ??? (for neutralizing the movement of each currency)

--- 帖子 #365 ---
If you are asking me sorry i didnt answer you because i have no idea! And btw this is not the thread for the dragon expert EA, thanks

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Anyone can share the best setting?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
The best settings so far I think are the defaults. The bad thing with this strategy is that if there is a big trend it is difficult to close the trade. I have usdjpy from last week and can not be closed. And the bad thing of this situation is that my account is -750€ so it is close to a blow up.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
whats your initial balance and margin in % at the moment. What is the max lot that it took on usd/jpy. For default settings you mean range at 100 or 500? Thanks

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Now I am -1000€ which is very high and the maximum lot is 0.41 First trade was at 109.477 0.0.2 lot at 15/6/2017 03.30 Last trade wat at 111.580 0.41 lot at 19/6/2017 22.30 Default setting If the price don't go below 111.200 i think trades will not close and keep waitting and waitting. Imagine to be i a real account of 2000€ . You would be very anxious Don't you think we risk so much for a little profit? In the other hand yesterday i opened 2 new trades with the "safe setting" (trade every 50pips) and they are still there no profits only one buy and one sell opened

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hi... You cannot use martingale on a $2000 account with starting lots 0.02. Minimum $10,000 is needed for 0.01 lot size. What I'm doing is, use a nano account: 1) Deposit $500 (nano account shows $50,000) 2) Starting lot size 0.001 (nano account shows 0.10) 3) Yield about (2%) $10 daily (nano account shows $1,000) Another high risk reward method, also nano account: 1) Deposit $500 (nano account shows $50,000) 2) Starting lot size 0.005 (nano account shows 0.50) 3) Yield about (10%) $50 daily (nano account shows $5,000)

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Which EA are you using please share the settings and EA. regards

--- 帖子 #372 ---
John pls come back take this EA to next level .lucky your efforts and guidance was also impressed us. You are light for all newbie here.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
The EA I'm using does not belong to me as such cannot be shared. I've inputted the settings into Joan's EA as attached. Use it on a $20K - $50K account to demo. Timeframe: 1 hour or 4 hour, up to you. Other settings: use default in the file. Pairs: As much pairs as possible. Preferably 20 pairs. Use pairs with lower than 3 pips spread. Notice: The EA should ALWAYS open two opposing trades. A series of buys and a series of sells. If it doesn't do that, then that pair cannot be used. Some bugs inherent in the codes. So just detach the EA and find other suitable pairs. What the EA does: First the equity will be slightly negative due to commission. All profits will go into balance. Equity will maintain at slightly negative. Until about few days to one week later, then the equity will start getting more and more positive as the unprofitable positions are closed.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Your setting difference is that you open a new trade every 50pips and not enery 10pips multiplier 1.5 and profit only 0.80? You will wait so much and gain only 0.8?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Thanks for the reply! I wanted to ask you one last thing. how many pairs are you\were you using in the EA test where you have \had - 1000 $ in open trades?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi kelvinyun, only to make that point clear - as You attached a .mq4 - did You modify this version? If yes, plz rename it (e.g. *-modified or something) in Your post. Btw. what You did sounds very interesting! I'm curious about the results and will give it a try, once I'm done with my actual tests... Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #378 ---
No amendments. Only changed the settings. Give it a try

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Thx buddy, I think it is not unimportant to understand that ... and yes, now if I re-read Your post - "I've inputted the settings into Joan's EA as attached." - I could have guessed that... So plz forgive my stupid question anyone! Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Ideally, the higher the lotsize, the higher the profit you want to earn. For example, if you want to earn 0.80 for every 0.01 lotsize, and the series of opened trades is: 0.01 0.02 0.03 Total = 0.06 x $0.80 = $4.80 Unfortunately there is no way to do it via Joan's marty.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
i ve made different tests on many Ea s and i have to say that i'm amazed to see that they are all in profits lol about Little martingale EA here i pass you the statement of 1 entire trading month May 24-June 23 as usual my converter to pdf (this site doesnt accept html files....) is bad and cuts the edges but results are clear to see after all 6 pairs (Eur\Usd, Usd\Chf, Aud\Usd, Gbp\Usd, Usd\Jpy, Usd\Cad) 1 M TF Default settings of version V1.4 (space is 500 pipettes(50pips))this is an old version shared in this thread by Joan. i will share it here now so if you want to test it too let me know..... Initial balance:1200 euros. this is NOT a cent account. broker is ECN , very low spread, an leverage is 1:100 actual balance: 2191 euros ----profit : 991 euros only problem? Ea has a BIG bug, a bug that I explained in other posts but that nobody here has commented on so I'm not sure if they ever noticed. i will repeat what the bug is about.:after having martingaled in sequence up to 0.12 (max lot taken by this version) it will take the next trade in the opposite direction of the martingale sequence (as if it was hedging) with 0.02 lot i dont know if this bug is the cause of success, if its luck or whatever it is, but hey even Coca Cola was invented out of a mistake so ........LOL anyway aside from the jokes who said that it was not possible to trade with a 1000 $ account. maybe he was referring to 20 pairs, this is on 6 but it can blow at any moment not because it is martingale but because it is an EA and it s trading after all Thanks, hope there will be opinions about this

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Nice profit you got there. The lots size you probably been lucky that the price didnt reach more than the next step of 0.12. But I noticed that usdcad get into 0.18 on your attachment. Btw I also use this version of Ea with thigher settings and CCI filter for about 3 weeks now, maybe just lucky the price did't get to more than 0.12 lots so far and didn't have the behaviour that you described (probably because it's different setting ).

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Thanks for pointing that out Fixtrdb and for the CCI tip , i had missed that 0.18 completely! This changes everything because not even the bug is "trustable" then lol

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Fixtrdb if you have time to answer what CCI period settings and what oter changes in settings do you use for un nom guai v1.4? thanks a lot! also what was your initial balance for the test? How many pairs?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I can see that this ea closes the trades individually. For example in the start it openes one buy and one sell. If the buy reaches the profit target it closes the trade and does not wait all trades of the pair to reach profit. This is better I think! And Jonas might have to work on this version to make it better Does it open a new trade after new candle? So Luca1073 it opens the new trade after a minute? If I have timeframe 1hour it will opend the new trade after the 1 hour (if needed of course for example I might be a big move) I will also test it

--- 帖子 #386 ---
a page earlier you had said that you had - 1000 $ in open trades while testing the EA. how many pairs did you have put on that test to have such floating loss? also the distance between trades was 10 or 50 pips? thanks

--- 帖子 #387 ---
The version I used is the v12 with default setting 3 pairs only eurusd,usdchf,usdjpy But as I wrote above the ea in v12 bahaves completly differenet

--- 帖子 #388 ---
thanks, i think default settings of v12 with a low balance will surely kill the account then.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
i think default settings of v12 could work only on ranging pairs (example Eur\chf) with a low initial balance account

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Yes I agree. The 1.4 is much better as it closes all buys and sells individually. In some backtest that I made now I noticed that if you put the profit to 2 (will close trade every 2€) the drowdwan is not much. It close the trade with inly 3 scales. What is your opinion?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
im using the backtest tool now with eur\chf for example. result is similar between v1.4 and v1.12 if i put same settings but then again shall i trust backtests? ahah im sort of convinced that we have to use space 100 for the ranging pairs. it may work well. haven tried the profit 2 , it seems very little v1.4 has a bug in my case or im missing something, im torn then anyway in backtest results are slightly better with v1.4 but the bug (or supposed one) BUGS me lol

--- 帖子 #392 ---
8 For ranging pairs the version 12 is ok. But for the others it is not. The version 1.4 has a small bug that i think it will be fixed easily.(when Jonas come back) I will test this week the 1.4 version. Seems for me better. If this week everythings goes well i will start in live account.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I use eurchf CCI 14, space 100 (5) the other defult gp 5. Sometime I have audusd 200 (5) cci 3 both 15mnt and 0.01 lots. Start account $180. Cheers

--- 帖子 #394 ---
At the end i discovered that what i pointed out on v1.4 version was not a bug, it was just an old trade that the price had got closer to later! So, thats good! Other than that v1.4 is simple and seems to work feature to open trade on a new candle is not present in this version however, that could be good for a big flash crash, even 15 m could save a ton of trades to be taken. But for that we have to use other versions (that many say have bugs) space for the first 5 orders (500 pipettes(50 pips) and the rest from settings. EA seems profitable and it is working well hey dont let this thread die, ok?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Push! The EA and this thread is very interesting. So plz keep on pushing everybody. I will also come back to tests of Joans EA when I have the time to... Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Yes I also want this thread should not disclose

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Just joined very interesting results. I want to test something like this but on a very small account say 200 at a time. Any suggestions for a new person here who has not yet tested? will be backtesting at first, just need to know if the version 1.12 on 1st page is best or the 1.4 version for small amounts, and where I can get a head start on the set files to run tests and show results on many different currency pairs?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
For Sonic4051 Stoploss = maximaloss only put a digit with a negative sign, for example -6 this means a maximum loss of six usd. Nice day

--- 帖子 #401 ---
In my oppinain v1.2 is best. My account is only 1000$ so i think you can run this EA but start at 0.01 with 2-3 pairs. dont worry about low margin coz EA open order small lot and many pairs so low risk in your account and important is SL for pairs must set.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Thank you very much, bro.

On 2nd January 2015, GU fell 420 pips and as usual martingale blew the account with 1000$ balance, 500 (50 pips) gap .. so any future event like that will kill the account..hence I am out of this EA.. Regards

--- 帖子 #405 ---
People say martingale systems work better with ranging pairs but seen that you give a date here please go to EUR /CHF(ranging pair) and see what happened 13 days later (january 15 , 2015) , after a Swiss National Bank surprise statement Euro lost something like 3000 pips in a few minutes... any order and not necessarily martingale unless the account was VERY but very well funded would have blown with that movement. After seeing that many people stayed out of forex completely , many lost everything and many of them didn't have any martingale EA going on. This is to say that forex is very risky and the big risks in forex really happen on these big flash crashes martingale or not

--- 帖子 #406 ---
this very true forex is very risky and its depend how u trade and we do not know future.but when swiss news many pepole make million money also only forex we can make fast money even we do job or bussiness we cant make as huge money... so high risk high gain this rule of forex.......

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Big test for the EA today as many pairs are trending heavily. About the stop loss maybe depending on balance there ahould be a max lot that EA should take to avoid going fast in margin call... About some kind of stop loss it could also be a good idea

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi to all; first a great thanks for the EA! Its a great tool and I will explain how I use it ....it can be a help. I have a manual breakout system that I use for a long time and when ALL conditions are met I start to use the EA (1.11). But I use it ONLY in the way of the trend (buy OR sell). As you see my english is not that good but I will try to upload the system I use,give me some time and you can see for yourself Have a nice weekend greetings Gino Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hello to all 2 days ago a weird thing ... However in 7 days almost 50% of profit

--- 帖子 #417 ---
is this a bug? all similar trades? all 0.01 and 0.02? hmmmm what version are you using?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
In your profit column all are 0 how did you make 50% profit? Did you use an ea? For sure you did not use the little martinagle. To post here means that you want to share something with us. What?

@ Luca1073 and zakgr reply in an hour

For Luca I'm using the latest version v1.12 ECN Account Pepperstone Razor demo initial equity 500,00 The test was not very professional, actually I used two EAs, I left the MT4 only 7 days 24h on my computer (from 19/07 to 27/07), while the rest of the time I left the MT4 in the evening. For this reason some trades were manually closed even in loss. The TF was 1 minute for UnNomGuai, for the other EA at 1 hour. Set as unchanged. Next after EURSD I also put a chart on GPBUSD. All was to understand how equity and DD behaved. On Thursday (it seems to me) I also had a Margin Calling (I went to 83%). You have to work on the EA and use MM better depending on your account (and pick it up often) but in my opinion it's a good start.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Lele, i guess you re Italian Like me (guessed also from your mt4 statement note "profitto") but we ll keep speaking English seen that this forum is in English. 500 euros is too little for this EA and especially for v.12 (and even more if you left default settings at 100 pipettes) margin call is assured...... and thursday and friday was simply crazy. one of the worst days of the year for any martingale strategy unfortunately trends up up up or down down with no retracement. even so your statement has something wrong, dont know what it is even if you explained about the other EA. my advice is to use one EA per platform so you dont get confused with the results Grazie e Ciao!

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Yes Italian I agree with everything, so I created a "chaos" system (with TF 1 minute) not to see the profit, but to what extent would it show the signs of weakness and after adjusting a little at a time to have a stable system (As it may be a martingale). If I'm going live I'll use a cent account for sure. However, the bug is there, it should be understood by the EA creator if he has any idea why those open and closed orders. Hello

Hi to all again, I want to report something like a bug and a suggestion The bug is: I have the usdjpy from Monday 26th where we have a big trend. The ea opened a 0.08 lot which is the fifth step of martinagle (I use the version 1.14) When the trend stopped from up and make a movement down the ea closed with profits only the trades 0.08 and 0.05 where I think it should wait and close all sells together. Why this was happened. The martinagle is a system that in theory you never loose. All depend on how big is your account. (for this reason I think we must use a cent account) My suggestion is that the steps could remain as version 1.14 but chage the multiplier The multiplier must double the lots, not just the previous step but all together. In order to understand my logic here is the steps 1. 0.02 lots 2. 0.04 lots 3. 0.12 ((0.02+0.04)*2) 4. 0.36 5. 1.08 I think of this becouse you will only need a very small retrace. 10-15 pips where now you need over 50 I can not back test my theory as in this ea there is only a multiplier When there is a big trend like lasts week on eur/usd the martinagles steps must close quickly in order not leave it go further and make new steps In eur/usd that have it opened from last Monday 26th I have a dd of 300euros and I am in 6th step (0.12lot) which means around 350pips (5*50+100) up I am jaild now in this and wait to drop more than 100pips (I made a backtest this same week with bigger multiplier and the result is that all the trades would have been closed but I got 0.33 lots (2.5 multiplier)

--- 帖子 #425 ---
If you re using version v1.4 and default settings 0.08 is 4 th step seen that first step is 0.02 i think EA closes trades only when trades cancel each other with a profit of 5 $ what you say about putting up stakes in te martingale sequence can be done just that the risks will multiply exponentially but its true that 15 pips retracement is better than - 50 pips one

--- 帖子 #426 ---
for 50 pip steps you really need patience to see profits but it s a bit(or a lot) less risky than 10 pip steps. well for 10 pip step you need big capital for sure

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Luca1073 if you have to work with "multiplier =???" then you have to increase "spaceorders = 5;" for example on 10 or 15.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
no it was not a bug i had cleared it in another later post

--- 帖子 #429 ---
I'm not sure if Joan is still following this thread , if he s still on holiday, if he busted his account or whatever it is. I'm still interested about this EA. i tested it on demo and did 1000 euros on 6 pairs from a 1200 euros account in one month. then tried it on live account and since june 26 it made already 362 euros from a 2500 euros initial account. but at a certain point the DD was dangerously high, it reached - 900 euros . now its ok and 0.12 lot trades have also been closed. probably i shouldnt have started on 0.02 lots but i wanted to try to reproduce my demo test . one curiosity though: if i had started the live test with 1200 euros now it would have busted, so 2500 euros should be the real minimum and more than that much better. but last week was very trendy and very bad for any martingale strategy this is not a cent account, its a normal account, ECN broker , 1:100 leverage my test is on v1.4 default settings, no CCI option, 500 pipettes for the first 5 orders , first lot 0.02, 6 pairs

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Very good. I think you should keep the 0.02 lot because trades will close faster. Which are the 6 pairs you chose? I might go live as well next week. I am thinking eurusd, usdchf and usdjpy In my opinion you need at least 1000 euros for each pair you have So 6 pair 6000 About Joan, i agree why he dont say anything. Where did he go and does not have internet to say a word

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hi Zakgr, your idea of having 6000 $ (1000 $ for every pair) seems definitely safer....the pairs that i chose are not the safest either for martingale because let's say they're not the typical ranging pairs lol but for example last week usd/jpy ranged a lot and ao aud/usd while the others trended a bit too much so you never know. This is an ECN broker (global prime australian) so all these pairs have very low spread (always less than 1 pip) Gbp/usd might be the riskiest one for all the past flash crashes and the political situation there my pairs so far have been: eur/usd gbp/usd usd/cad usd/chf isd/jpy aud/usd

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Try not to use any JPY pair. Aside from the ones you use, try these pairs: EURCHF EURGBP AUDCAD AUDNZD NZDCAD

--- 帖子 #433 ---
thanks yes i put a demo test yesterday with 3 more pairs &amp; more balance and there was also eur\chf and eur\gbp in the group. i think these days CAD pairs might be dangerous these days for the possible soon rate hike( interest rate decision in canada)and the oil price issue....

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi joancb I really like your EA I have an idea: Use Trailing Stop - to maximize profits Add the TrailingStopStep setting If TrailingStopStep = 0.0, do not use Trailing Stop If TrailingStop&gt; 1, use Trailing Stop -------------------------------------------------- -------- Use the following settings Profit = 0.0 Globalprofit = 50.0 Pairglobalprofit = 0.0 TrailingStopStep = 5.0 When the globalprofit = 50, ready to begin to receive a single, the highest to 65, down 5,60 on all the single. The worst situation is 45 all received a single, (Profit, globalprofit, pairglobalprofit, all three modes can be used) -------------------------------------------------- -------- Steps to simplify: 1. 50 start 2. 65 highest 3. highest-5 4. 60 receipt -------------------------------------------------- -------- Thanks again for your EA.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
let me guess, the thread is dead because the author left...weird because he was always around before.....well it's like any other thread then, let's hope that the EA will stand out on top of the other EAs though Thanks for the EA Joan. btw if your EA busted it's only normal if you re using 28 pairs, cent account or not

--- 帖子 #436 ---
People are afraid to trade using martingale. The EA is good, but you have to be ready to ad money to your account in case of Margin Level is less then 2000. Or drawdown more then 50%. The friend of mine trades like this. He withdraw gaine constantly. Sometimes he busts

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Yes i agree with you. I think you mean to deposit more money when margin is less than 200% because 2000% is very good IMO.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I mean "Margin Level". You can see it on your terminal. Or use some indicator to see drawdown. Actualy, it is easy to determine it. I have been trading by EA's with martingale system for years.If your profit 2-5% a month- it's safe trading.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
yes margin level in terminal is in %. that's good that it has been working for you. It is definitely encouraging

Guys, maybe it would not be bad to subscribe to the author - if you expect something from him.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Fore...693243/1073263 - check it out, guys. This is the way, how good martingale EA should work. If you want to have more- be ready to risk your capital more... I am pretty sure that "lite martingale EA" can do same job. It depends on MM only.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hi Vitall, Thanks for sharing your fxbook link. Seeing is believing! Can I know how did the EA perform during Brexit, Flash crash etc..? Thanks..

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Thanks a lot, looking at the stats, it seems a low risk\ relatively medium low reward because it has been going on since 2014. am i right? also it seems to be on 3 pairs (eur usd- gbp usd- aud usd) your leverage is high though but i dont know the strategy behind. is it like joans EA? does it take trades every 50 pips or what? thanks

--- 帖子 #445 ---
i'm just curious if there are any new opinions from the EA author, since that he shared it here but of course i dont expect anything from him. he has already been kind in sharing it

--- 帖子 #446 ---
another thing that i dont want to do is interferring manually on the EA anymore, if possible. Last week there was a huge drop of usd\cad that brought the EA to take a 0.18 lot trade . it was friday night and i was afraid of a gap down on monday so last friday before the market closed , i closed the 0.18 lot trade when i was in a little profit of 10 euros. FYI you need approx 120 euros + on a 0.18 lot trade to close the other bad trades(0.12, 0.08 etc) in profit....now on monday there was a rebound instead of the usd so if i had left the 0.18 lot doing its course i would have already closed most trades in profit but the story is different and interest rate decision is coming too lol, but its still ok. moral of the story: better not to intervene and trust the EA and have enough money in account. anyway things are going good so far. have 497 euros profit in live account after 2 weeks so the demo test i had done with 1000 euros profit in 1 month seems confirmed on 6 pairs, so far

--- 帖子 #447 ---
That is not my monitoring I just found it. The guys sell that EA.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi, I'll be off until the end of August. The code is open for everybody to modify it. started 2017/4/17: https://www.fxblue.com/users/joancb/...date=2017/6/19 cheers!

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Good To know Joan! I\we started thinking you were not interested anymore . nice to see it s not true

--- 帖子 #450 ---
If your goal is to make 2-5% a month you shoul be ok for Brexit and other things like that. The thing is: if you make more money your risk to get busted is going up. It is just simple math. One can servive a few "Brexits" and starts to think ""that's the Graal"! And the next market storm blows everything out. I had this situation 8-9 times. I would suggest to everybody to become the investor, making 2-5%. To make big %% you should be the trader, but it takes time and a lot of efforts. Everithing I am saying is based on my experience working with EA's. It's about 8-9 years...

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Thanks for the insight Vitall!

--- 帖子 #452 ---
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/kelvinyun I've started the martingale strategy on two real accounts: a) ** FBS Low Risk : target 5% to 15% return per month. Drawdown expected is 30% - 40% max. b) FBS Normal Risk: target 15% to 25% return per month. Drawdown expected is 20% - 30% max. **I did not test fully / configure properly the EA prior to using it on the first account "FBS Low Risk" , so , so i closed all position, took some loses, and restart anew. Starting cap is USD1,000 - FBS gave a bonus of 100%, USD1,000 withdraw-able provided that 300 hundred lots is traded lol. Let's see how it goes. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #453 ---
it's good (as kelvinyun did) to share our tests (live or demo) with The Little Martingale EA and so i will do it too at least for now, then if i will disable it it will not be a good sign lol, but for now here it is. 506 Euros profit since june 26. initially the test started with a 2495 euro balance , then 1000 euros more were added out of "security".... this is my fxbook link. equity is still barely above initial balance but the first week was very trendy so it didn't start so well but its like that. profits so far mirror the test in demo on 6 pairs (1000 euros in one month) Global prime broker, 100:1 leverage https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Leverage 1:500 seems ok but is that with a standard account? The ECN accounts (1:500) have a minimum lot size of 0.1 so that's a no go. The real conditions with FBS are "hidden" in the "personal area" - after you register of course...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
maybe with FBS only? in general it s not true that ECN accounts have only minimum 0.1 lots. ECN accounts also allow 0.01 like in my case and mine is a real pure ECN, they even provide receipts (if asked) of the orders they send directly to the market Global Prime broker , top stars on forex peace army

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Well, that's what they state on their page (ECN &amp; Unlimited accs.) I have an account with GP also but only 1:100 is very close to the Damocles area here...

--- 帖子 #457 ---
you re saying that 1:500 is better than 1:100? well 1:500 can be definitely riskier , no?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
1:500- is a minimal leverage to trade martingale. In case of 1:100 the margin will eat the balance and the EA will not be able to open new orders. So, you can not trade with any broker if going to use martingale strategy.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Wouldn't that depend on how you use it? Starting with the smallest lotsize you have a better chance to survive with 1:500. Although many brokers have different margin requirements along different pairs (certainly metals) so one has to choose carefully....

--- 帖子 #460 ---
i found this phrase about a martingale discussion on forex factory. its actually not bad as a statement "To summarize: if you martingale each...20 pip you get more money but the chance of death trade is high.... If you martingale each 100 pip the chance of death trade is almost never going to happen but the waiting time will destroy your mentality." well Joan's EA at least starts with 50 pip space in default settings of the first version so its something in the middle. yes the space between orders is very important

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Do not risk your money, guys. It is not that easy to trade martingale. Learn it first- it takes time and efforts. Start with demo or 100% bonus- it's the best.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
See picture: Would it be wise to enter after 4th position (ex. 0.08) plus 0.04 buy. Then after (0.12) plus 0.06 buy. Then after (0.18) plus 0.09 buy etc. Does someone like to program it?

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Also i just noticed that the EA took a 0.18 trade on eur/usd 50 pips in advance or so it seems to me....also i cant find the first smallest trade of the sequence on eur/usd in the list of the opened ongoing trades. I dont know if thats related to the fact that the EA took a trade 50 pips in advance.....

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Very interesting and lightweight EA that trades both directions. Thank you Joancb!!! However, we should be careful with so many compilation warnings. It would be nice to have a good soul here , who would adapt this EA to the new 1000+ build.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
so i found out that if you close let's say a 0.18 trade in advance the EA will wait another 100 pips (if in settings next order is 1000 pipettes) to take another 0.\18 trade. it will not skip to a 0.27 trade. these are mistakes that you don't do when its demo because you dont care. so definitely if you use this in live account beware not to close (if possible) trades beforehand. today EA profited very well until a hour ago and so was equity, problem is the usd\cad that is dragging thngs down now so far. RSI now on USD\CAD on the daily chart is 18 , simply crazy how CAD is appreciating fast, so far

--- 帖子 #466 ---
unfortunately had to restart the live test due to my mistakes, so myfxbook link is temporarily disabled. its ok. EA seems good but it has to be dealt with well. will try to enable notifications by email or through push ( i guess there is) to warn me if margin goes below 200 - 250 % or so so that i don't go there to check all the time because that could damage the performance if i act on it too soon

--- 帖子 #467 ---
this is the tool i found to notify you of low margin and warn you by message just put it on any chart or on another blank chart next to your EA (that's what i did) indicator will not appear on chart but in settings (the only one) you have to put the margin that you want to be warned about(default is 300 %), when it goes below that number it will send you a message on your mobile\mt4 app Little Martingale EA is up and running again. Never give up lol, it cashed 29 euros already this morning sorry for the mess with myfxbook account. now its available again online ,calculating data from today. test from june 26 is unfortunately invalid due to my mistakes ( that i will not do anymore) https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Just ran with default settings on live account on USDJPY and CHFJPY. I didn't set a profit setting yet. How does it work ? Can't find it.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Why you say that? Did you backtest it, is it a pair that ranged or what else? thanks

--- 帖子 #470 ---
whoch version of EA did you use? The profit setting in default in my v1.4 is 5 and refers to one pair profit in the basket. Be careful that if you re using v11 or v12 the default settings for space between orders is 100 pipettes that in my opinion in a little bit of trending market is purely suicidal unless you have a big account (maybe 20000 $ + for 6 pairs). These are all guesses since that i ve been testing this EA for only 1 month and half but still i start having an idea

--- 帖子 #471 ---
backtesting with any JPY pairs crashed the account. That's the reason I closed ALL POSITIONS and started anew for my first "Low Risk" account. I did not test beforehand... and within two days, the negative equity due to JPY pairs was so high that i gotten shocked and quickly do a backtest.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
It looks like he can not answer. "Someone" shot him.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
You should never trade JPY pairs with Martingail as JPY pairs are seen as runners and can run a couple of 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Actually a couple of hundred pops with space 50 pips between orders is not so bad but the problem is that any pair can trend: look at CAD pairs these days. Look at the aus/usd these days. No pair is immune

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Unfortunately Found a bug with version 1.4 . In two three currency pairs the EA took identical trades (0.03 and 0.05) Always buy or sells(identical respecting the martingale sequence) at little in distance in pips and time from one another. This is not good because it accumulates unnecessary drawdown .and it could prevent a higher lot to close once the pullback is ongoing. It has to be monitored in case and the excess trade closed manually.also it could be closed manually when a bit in profit or a bit in loss..... This could (i say could) bring trouble

--- 帖子 #476 ---
i will go on posting more or less alone here lol because i think it s worth it. another forum member here (zakgr i think) said that to trade this EA with a standard account (1:100 leverage) we need 1000 $ \ currency pair traded. well i think his statement is not that far from reality. drawdown can get pretty pretty big and lets say you have 6 pairs. a move of 300 -400 pips if you use settings space 50 between trades and from trade 5 to trade 6 (0.18 lots +)you use 100 pips will set you back around 700 euros or more\pair. of course you must be very unlucky to have 6 pairs trending continuously but it can happen and one can trend even more and give you problems with margin. aud\usd had a huge move these last two weeks that seriously scared me. luckily jobs report was not so good and aud went down. if you have 1000 $ \pair you are surely assured to feel less choked lol. this is a style of trading not for everybody and you realize it when you trade it live. i still think it s worth it for the risk\reward ratio but it has to be monitored and you have to know it is indeed risky . MM is important and definitely you dont want trades more than 0.27 lots thats crazy.....Good luck everybody

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I agree Lucas, as a general rule of a working martingale strategy, the most crucial part will be the Money management, and 1000 usd per pair is the least you need for running live. non black Swan event effect expected. If you put 1000 on GBp most probably you won't get thru Brexit. Keep an eye on major event and prepare enaugh bullet to tank normal news, withdraw constantly to reduce risk, eventually every mart blows.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi luca, though You are posting almost alone - You are not alone here! I do follow this and Your postings. I'm just busy on two other EAs atm. I will get back to this and also post here. Just go on buddy! Cheers Barlam

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Sir you are not alone I am also with you.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Good to know Barlam!! Thanks a lot! Luca

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Luca At last the EA is done. Screen shot of back testing.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Is that the other project you were working on? Was the other EA joan had coded and shared here?

--- 帖子 #483 ---
This EA I paid someone to code for me. Joans one is a bit off. I see the results is quit similar to the strong Martingale, but we use different methods.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
well thats good then , hope it reproduces the backtests in real trading let us know if you want. I didnt really follow the discussion about your method , but i know you talked about it in the first pages pf this thread. Is it less risky?

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I use it without vps. The EA is discontinuous. When I turn on the computer again, it does not open a new order.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
if you turn off your computer (not having\using a vps) you will screw up the EA performance but why should it open a new order? does it respect the sequence? two orders will always be opened (one buy and one sell) if no orders are on that chart also if you are using a newer version with the "open on new candle feature" if you place the EA for example on H1 you will have to wait at least one hour for each order lol

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Thank luca 1073 I will test newer version

--- 帖子 #488 ---
so far the most stable (IMO) seems to be v1.4 (here attached but it has bugs from time to time) but doesn't have the open on new candle feature(it just calculates pips). scroll a few pages back (post 448) maybe joan coded a new first version (un nom guai) with that feature

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi guys, I am using the ea v1.4 My settings are : 1.50pips per step 2.multiplier 2.5 3.profit every 5€ I trade 1 pair for every 2000€ in order to be sure I am trading eur/usd only as my account has only 2000 In this big trend that have been on eur/usd I passed ok I went till fifth step but today it closed One thing - clue I am doing is: when i see a trend and i am in 3 step i say to ea to close all trades (once ea has finished) . With this way i start the steps from the begining. I might wait a day for the trend also to calm

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi Zakgr, wow, i see the safe part to trade 2000 $\pair but the unsafe part multiplier 2.5? wow thats risky. but you may be right it could recover faster. i ve had a huge drawdown on aud\usd last week on multiplier 1.5. now its much better for now . i have 596 euro profit since july 13, account is now 4093 euros \6 pairs(equity 3190), only 2 pairs are trending for real at this time the others are calm. let us know know your updates\profits of course you can close all trades on one pair but try to close them in profit even if little P.s V1.4 still has some bugs. it doesn't take all trades at the right level(it even took double identical trades), i've been forced to close trades beforehand manually and that puts the grid in "confusion" but still overall i like this EA. also when you have a pair that opened for example 0.18 trades (at multiplier 1.5) you will see floating loss changing hugely in a few minutes. it can literally go from - 700 euros to - 1200 euros in minutes. trust me i ve seen it. On multiplier 2.5 if you have a big lot trade ongoing (let say 0.30) if there are some major expected or unexpected news your equity and margin can suffer big we are talking about live account here, not demo, and Zakgr too

--- 帖子 #491 ---
You are right Luca, I just realised v1.4 have bug in it. My trading was open more grid when not supposed to. Funny thing that it kinda save my account from blowing but it did blow the other account (cents) thought.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hi guys, Luca is right. EA is unstable and I would not recommend it for live trading. The question is - how much is the new Steroid MT stable and whether is it even usable for EA trading. This issue applies especially to EAs using Global Variables from MegaTrouble (MT).

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hello! Yes all martingale EA is not stable and can loss all money in one time! So this big risk!

--- 帖子 #494 ---
On steroid is the AUD\USD ....did you see there? probably almost 500 pips reached this morning without a decent retracement..... Until Trump is in office i can honestly say that trading is even riskier and with a lot of unexpected moves even more than it used to be.....

--- 帖子 #495 ---
And what do you mean - why he tweets several times a day? And why we all get it as an @breaking news? He also trades ...

--- 帖子 #496 ---
EA may be buggy but it s intelligent : just now it took an identical buy trade(in total 2 identical) on usd/chf to counteract the two sell identical trades of usd/chf Lol. So 2-2 we are at parity now ahah Damn Aus/usd now luckily retracing a bit... The reserve bank of australia apparently will not raise interest rates just to try to stop its raising value. People keep buying it and trashing USD Covfefe

--- 帖子 #497 ---
I dont trade aud/usd but i did not see any 500pips movement today. Did you mean points? 50pips are ok for one day

--- 帖子 #498 ---
You all talking about that the ea has bugs. I have not noticed any bug Trades are opened every 50 pips and profits are 5€ I have opened now a cent account because i am afraid of big DD and i have 5 pairs only which they give me 1-2euros a day Settings are: Profits 5€ Multiplier 2.5 Starting lot 0.10 (because it is a cent account) Everything seems ok to be with no bug

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Please can you myfxbook the account to see the progress?

--- 帖子 #500 ---
no i meant Pips. I meant "500 pips until today" (yesterday) not in one day of course (even if that can happen). The movement withoit a decnt retracement started at 0.75800 and went up to 0.806 approx (that should be 480 pips )

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Amd about the bugs zagkr i found many but im happy if you didnt experince any, lets hope it continues like that

I saw the movemet you say. It is a trend for 3-4 days. Though after this there are some retracments for about 30 or 50 pips Thats why I use the 2.5 multiplier. With 2.5 multiplier i need a retracment of about 25-30 pips and trades close. Think about it. With defaults settings you need more than 50pips You can backtest my settings Also a tip that i have written it again. When you see a pair trending say the ea to suspend the tades. Wait the trend to calm and then start over.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I agree that with default settings you need more than 30 pips, often 60_ 70 or i guess even more if you arrived for example at a 0,18 lot wih space at 1000 pipettes...still i find that multiplier 2.5 feels too risky for my tastes but again its just a feeling , i may be wrong The trend on aud/ usd is more than 3_4 days, it has been weeks, also when these bad trades accumulate often even the negative swap fees accumulate . this gives credit to your 2.5 multiplier idea... Thanks for the tips

Since July 13 (start of the live test, 16 days ago) 858 euros were done(profit) but due to the big drawdown on aud usd equity is well below initial balance , but i have to say this varies greatly during the day, gets much better sometimes or even worse. luckily there were no extra trades or bugs until now on this particular sequence of trades on the aud usd so the drawdown on these trades is just due to the settings and the behaviour of the market.... EA is actually cashing in more in live trading than when i did the test on demo but just because in that month when i did a demo test(initial balance was only 1200 euros and final profit 1000 euros and 800 euros above initial balance, amazing no?) there was probably not a huge trend going on, which is weird because there were interest rates decsions and lots of news etc. and that is why everything seemed positive to me its always like that when you start live tests the action begins lol. anyway the fact that is profiting much faster is helping at least to counteract the drawdown. it basically did almost if not exactly double of the money for the amount of time of the demo test. the demo test, default settings, 6 pairs, did 1000 euros in 30 days. this so far did 858 euros in 16 calendar days. more to test, more to discuss for sure

--- 帖子 #505 ---
have you seen the huge move up on eur\chf? the so called "ranging pair" ? well definitely not ranging these days. gained 400 pips in the last 5 days non stop plus another 200 in th previous week\s. RSI is almost at 88 on the daily chart and 86 on W1 lol. this tells you there is no real "safe" pair to trade lol if you expect for a reversal. im not trading this pair though

--- 帖子 #506 ---
exactly luca1073. there is no real ranging pair and so all martingales will have same fate! that huge movement in chf/jpy last weak (bigger than 340 pips!) could blow up a very big account and the main fact to notice is that there where no red news on this pair!!

--- 帖子 #507 ---
i have 2 questions. i hope the author or someone else here can answer: 1) Can the performance\ slowness of a certain Vps affect the performance of Little Martingale EA (the bug or other issue)? 2) What happens if during the weekend (when markets are closed) i close all the charts on one Vps and platform (also reason it is expiring at the end of august) and re-sign in on another platform \ faster \better Vps with the same broker account? i know the trades will still be there but my question is : will The EA recognize &amp; take into consideration those old trades when taking new ones and respect the grid or start again with new fresh trades messing up the whole thing ?Lol ....well maybe the EA will recognize them from the codes those old trades (and act accordingly\respect the martingale sequence)but I WANT TO BE SURE...after all it s a Live account i hope someone can answer, Thanks!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
1- the slowness is ok. It should not affect working EA. 2- nobody can answer for sure, even the author. Theoreticaly the EA has to recognize the orders if they have same Magic number. But I had problems with that a few times. Check it on demo first- the best way!

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thanks a lot Vitall for the tips and the help!

--- 帖子 #510 ---
This EA reads Global Variables and It's hard to say how it will work when you open old trades on a new platform - but with an empty GV folder. I would rather manually close all positive and 0€ trades.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks for your opinion

--- 帖子 #512 ---
BTW i've stopped the martingale EA. For the risk is too great. I would have busted another two more accounts based on the current price action of several pairs had I not stopped it.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Take two tests for example: my live test and demo test both with 6 pairs and similar starting balance (demo had a bit more money) . I put demo on a better vps, yes i know it sounds weird but i discovered google vps theee days after starting the live teet and i discovered it was good only after a week or two. Lets go back to the two tests... one started july 13 with 3496 euros. At the moment of writing it has 4720 balance and 3120 in equity so a lot of floating trades but margin is still "ok".... Now let's go to the demo test started a few days later on a faster vps, where there was no intervention from my side and when there was a bit of luck because aud usd started trending a few days earlier and i didnt see much trouble with bugs or other stuff (at least i didn't notice) . Well the demo test started on 5300 euros last night when i chacked had 940 euros in profits , only - 350 euros in open trades and 1200 % margin. What does this tell you? That i probably made my live test riskier by intervening manually and adding to bug mistakes and then the slow Vps might have had its toll. Profit is still similar for similar amount of days but floating loss is greater. I still like Little martingale EA. You can check on it by clicking on the link in myfxbook will share it later again in case people here don't have it, thanks EDIT: this is myfxbook link of my live test: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946 and this below is my demo test on a faster, newer vps as i explained above started a few days later. as i said i never intervened on this one. but tests were not started at the same time so different market conditions have also applied https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...086501/2205656

The primary difference between a demo account and a live account, something which people never seem to take into consideration, is that its a simulation, there is no other party waiting to take your trade, you will always receive instant execution on your trades, no matter what (demo server issues aside). A live account may not, and when getting into higher position sizes most probably will not, have the same execution speed, and depending on your broker and how they process trades (STP or market maker etc) could make all the difference in the world.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
mine luckily is a good broker, pure ECN , global prime, they really send your trades to the market and even provide receipts if asked. i compared demo and live account in the past and it was the same but as you say issues may always happen maybe with slippage or else, thanks

--- 帖子 #516 ---
i put the myfxbook links in my earlier post, thanks

--- 帖子 #517 ---
also something else worth of a note is the equity curve in relation to its initial amount. min equity during the live test was - 23 % from the original initial equity now it stands at - 11 % approx. this varies constantly of course but - 23 % was so far the lowest i ve seen. the drawdown is something else and it refers to the actual balance. that in the live test was big, unfortunately - 44 %, now its less ( - 35 %) now EA is profiting an average of + 1 % approx per day (growth in balance) big risk in this kind of EA is the likelyhood of a margin call in case account is not funded properly. now for example margin is at 300 % approx. i ve seen it go down to 200 %. in case of margin call (and stop out as a result --that is at 100 % with my broker--margin warning call is at 125 % ) broker will close the biggest negative positions and that would basically destroy your profits and\or your capital. thats why margin is actually the most important thing to be monitored a way to avoid impending margin call is to add more funds in the account or try to close beforehand some big lot positions (even if positive). that will likely reduce the risk of a margin call\stop

--- 帖子 #518 ---
I'm also running this on a live cent which have $60 ~ 6000USDC, can i know your withdrawal method. ex- do you withdraw profit after % gain or daily or after 100%. Thanks for this EA

--- 帖子 #519 ---
i don't know if you're talking to me (maybe not) . i would withdraw profits every 1000 $ profit (maybe ) but only if ABOVE initial equity

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Thanks mate, do you use version 1.4 and can you please share set file when you got free time

--- 帖子 #521 ---
yes v1.4 and no need for set file, im using default. timeframe doesnt matter on this version because there is no "open on new candle" feauture im using 6 pairs with the lowest spread (ECN broker) eur\usd aud\usd usd\jpy usd\chf usd\cad gbp\usd

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi.. been great talking to you guys. I've decided to stop martingaling and hence there's no place for me in this post anymore. Cya and good luck.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Good Luck!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Great Thanks, do you also use globalprofit parameter

--- 帖子 #525 ---
You re Welcome! No, so far i only used "profit" and the setting is 5 (as default)

--- 帖子 #526 ---
lets hope , that in the long term , the withdrawal is bigger than total MC , thats my expectation when using martingale ea, im putting this ea to one of my portfolio. thanks luca.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Thanks mate, can you also suggest a good lot size for a account which have USD Cents 3000

--- 帖子 #528 ---
well i started with 3500 and 0.02 lot but to be on the safe side maybe do 0.01 but you could try 0.02 for sure as initial lot

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Dear Sir how can ni download it thank you so much

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Any one can explain i there any visual explain on this EA. Is it same like price retracements levels is there EA builder where i can use price action using Fibonacci ratio

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi luca1073 Inserted Code the drawdown is something else and it refers to the actual balance. that in the live test was big, unfortunately - 44 %, now its less ( - 35 %) Yes i can see vast difference using demo and live 1. In demo i use to get the orders executed on right price but in live it was not same. 2. In demo TP executed on right price not even one time failed. But i live i see more time, TP is crossing still it was executed. I have hit the SP also without giving my TP . I can't show my anger this is 100% cheating by the broker. Is it impossible to test all broker who is giving the right feed. more than 95% r fraud not giving the liquidity on right price. Most of the time TP was not executed if the lot size is more in MG. or we should have enough money for DD but i seen for 100$ profit with need have 10k DD. Still risking since lot size will be high. So we need to use same lot with MG with same lot size but wait for retracement

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Hi, Can this ea add feature by layer input? means it will open the position with the value we inserted.. for example current layer 22 as we input the layer 22, EA will open the position as layer 1

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi Luca How it is going? What is your biggest dd? Do you use cci?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
please dont pay attention to my numbers and my test due to mistakes i did, but keep them as reference, mistakes were closing earlier some trades and due to some bugs in the EA. on 6 pairs if you behave well and dont interfere you can have a drawdown of 600-800 € easily. if you make mistakes double that easily. you must have as you once said 1000 $ \pair as balance but you could make it also with less 500-700$\pair. in my case at the moment drawdown from initial equity is - 636 euro (drawdown from balance is much more) balance profit is + 1465 euros since July 13 (little over one month) i tested the change of vps during the weekend (on demo as advised) and unfortunately once you change platform the distance in steps is not recognized so it will take a step every 50 pips anyway and will not respect space order 2 or 3 of the settings you put. i dont use CCI how is your test going?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
The dd dependes on the trend. If there is big trend the dd will be big. In the cent account i had a dd 40.000 eur-cents in gbp/jpy and in order not to blow the account i closed manually the trade with some lose. 10.000 eur-cents I dont have a vps but i have a pc working all day and all night. By mistake i closed the mt4 and reopened and had same problem with you. In my standard account where i trade only eur/usd things went well Low dd but low profits. I close it for time to time because i am afraid. I am testing now the cci which seems to be good as filters some bad trades but i think have bugs as i noticed that the ea does not open trades when cross the -100 (Put 14 period on the cci option) As a conclusion the ea is good with some problems I wish the authur come back and help us.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
yes the DD depends on trend but also if you play too much with the EA (close trades beforehand manually for example and leave some open that you\or the EA should have closed). in my opinion you should have a vps. its also free for one year..... i agree with the rest. also gbp\jpy was considered time ago the strongest trending currency, i wouldnt use it

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Where did you find a free vps Would you send a link?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Im from mobile now check amazon aws but you have to look for tutorials on youtube on how to open one, you need a valod credit card (you will not pay its just to register) and one email address. You can open as many vps accounts with same credit card but change email address https://aws.amazon.com/free/

--- 帖子 #539 ---
But those VPS is for Linux not for windows to run MT4 we need window.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
NOT AT ALL.... look better in amazon aws options scroll in the options windows is there. At some point i had 11 windows vps and all free lol note: you cannot have more than 1 instance running per account oterwise YOU WILL GET CHARGED there is also google vps for free but that probably will last less than 1 year

--- 帖子 #541 ---
It tells me to give my visa number. Did you gave it?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Seriously??? Maybe you live in the usa? We live in a police state world. Answeing your question no they didnt ask me but my residence country is Italy

--- 帖子 #543 ---
best for this EA is never to touch it once you click "autotrade on" even with all the bugs or alternatively not trade it at all lol. my live account has been a rollercoaster of equity disasters and possibly due to my interventions, bad luck , and some bugs. but still there , alive and kicking. while the demo is really in good shape, worth of a forex prize for best EA of the year lol, never intervened on it, yes there were a few bugs (and equity went down temporarily but in a healthy way) showing up but didn't affect the end result. this particular demo test im talking about was started just 3 days after the live test global prime is a serious honest forex ecn broker and demo or live platform accounts behave the same. i compared in the past and they looked identical. difference in this test is the date it was started and my numerous interventions and initial balance was a bit different....learning from this for sure Live Test: started july 13 2017 : total deposits 4496 eur actual equity :3920 eur actual balance: 6178 eur gain in equity : - 576 eur gain in balance: + 1682 eur demo test started july 16 2017 total deposits : 5300 eur actual equity : 6904 eur actual balance: 7056 eur gain in equity : + 1604 eur gain in balance: + 1756 eur 6 forex major pairs v1.4 version, NO CCI , default settings

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I love Martingale systems because you can never lose... unless you get too greedy.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi luca1073, Could you please share the setting file what you use. Can i know which broker r you using and lot multipler and size you have used. And which pair you you ran this EA

--- 帖子 #546 ---
well "yes" but to be sure of "never losing" we need right amount of balance (huge?) and good ratio in pips between orders.....

--- 帖子 #547 ---
i use 6 pairs . timeframe is not important because this version i use doesn't have "open on new candle" feauture..... Eur/Usd Aud/Usd Usd/Jpy Usd/Chf Gbp/Usd Usd/Cad Broker is Global Prime (Australian) pure ECN , even provides receipts of orders sent to the market (if asked) . spread is low max 0.9 -1.1 pips on these pairs, often much less (0.3 - 0.7 pips). commission is 0.06 euro / 0.01 lot . probably when you trade in $ is 0.07 EA version i use is attached. i had posted it previously saying i was using it with default settings, maybe you didn't notice multiplier is default : 1.5. initial lot size is 0.02 , distance in first 5 orders is 500 pipettes (50 pips)

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Martingale will blow your account at last.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
you have any experience on this i have see real accounting with 60K deposit running more then 4 years and making 40 to 100K return. But i can see it was using very low lots multiplier

--- 帖子 #550 ---
what multiplier were they using?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
ok you r using default settings for. But how come you able to run SIX pair with 4496 eur. Can i know you max DD What chart r you using 5m or 1m. And what is distance in pips after 5 orders.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Due to my mistakes( wrong interventions) and some bad market conditions max drawdown has been huge so far it went approx to -3000 when account was already at 6100 though. After 5 orders 6 th order will be taken at 1000 pipette (distance :100 pips) and then next orders at 2000 pipettes (200 pips from last) sp far max lot taken was 0.18 in 1 month and a half which is 6 th order if you use 0.02 as first. If you use 0.01 it would be 0.12. There are bugs though ----sometimes EA will take a double order or not at the right level---- the demo test where i didnt intervene had a max DD of about - 900 approx

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Why you have chosen this EA you have compared with any MG EA. R you still running this EA or stopped or you testing any other EA.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
i have tried others but hadnt convinced me enough. Of course i have not tried many martingale EA s so i cannot really make a complete comparison. This attracted my attention because i tried it on demo only with a 1200 euro account and same six pairs initially and after 1 month it had made 900 euro and didnt blow which is amazing but maybe it was luck because initial balance was too low.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
martingale will work to a certain extend if you calculate the risks carefully and withdraw from the account consistently.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Thats what i thought too, of course withdraw only if equity is above initial balance maybe 1000 $ at a time lol margin is an issue too with the quantiy of orders and lots trades of course

--- 帖子 #557 ---
To answer your second question at the moment im using only this EA on a live account and its still running

--- 帖子 #558 ---
anyway in case people want to follow the results just click on this link for myfxbook live account test updated usually every 5 minutes and the demo test link. if you check the trades on the live test and the trades opened at the moment there is a bit of confusion due to some interventions from my side. today account has been reducing the drawdown considerably and now equity while i write is "only" - 273 euros from intial equity at 4223 euros (initial was 4496), balance is at 6216 euros. while if you check the demo test is doing way better (actually very good). i explained a few posts earlier why link for the live test: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946 link for the demo test: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...086501/2205656

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Can i know what VPS r you using and the cost for one month how many MT4 session you have opened in one VPS. R you using demo and real from same VPS You face any reboot issue. How you manage on that time

--- 帖子 #560 ---
using amazon free vps, never got rebooted. actually in september i will start getting charged around 9 $ a month(cheap slow micro vps unfortunately) because my 12 month free trial expires and when i started the live test i didnt pay attention to the vps expiring soon.... it will not reboot i will just get charged.starting sept 1...i cannot move the EA to a new free vps because i tried doing it on demo and EA didnt respect the martingale levels distance in pips and started taking even 6-7 order at 50 pips. tooo risky, i prefer to pay 9 $ a month for now....the EA has bugs, you should be aware on these free slow vps you can open only two broker platforms max. one broker platform with many charts is ok

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Well it has been a rollercoaster but it has been building balance (over 1800 euros in 1 month and a half ) and now i checked and equity is only - 80 euros from initial deposit. We ll see how it goes , but drawdown has reduced of over 1000 in the last 24 hs lol and whats important many bad trades have beem closed but still there are many bad ones that will need to be closed. While if i look at the demo test im certainly jealous but i have faith the live test will catch up eventually eheh.. We ll see margin is now at 370% which for 6 pairs and this kind of balance is not bad. When i see margin go below 200% is not a good sign. So far the minimum i have seen was 180% . At 125% with my broker it will stop taking new trades (i think) and at 100% the most negative positions will be closed until margin goes back over 100% again. When that happens usually a small big disaster happens also another thing has to be taken into account and thats the swap fees. On some trades negative swap fees especially on bigger lots go up quickly. Those with positive swaps increase less fast. After weeks have passed you can have quite high swap fees accumulating in debts and when trades are closed by the EA often they re not calculated by the EA sp cluster of trades emd up at loss but at the end for not so much. Its always better to close old bad trades

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Now im curious to know how many people like me are live with this EA and how it is going. Dont be shy and say it here lol

--- 帖子 #563 ---
My logic say to take 5$ to10$ daily profit, i need to keep DD balance up to 1000$ which is safe and don't multiple using 1.5 instead multiple with 1.25. And stop the trade when News happen wait for retrace or if it reach 100 pips per day

--- 帖子 #564 ---
i dont know multiplier 1.25 is not going to change much for the first lots . 100 pips retracement is a lot IMO dont expect it to happen so often . These days with aud/usd it has retraced but hardly below 0.79 , creating a big stall in open trades that at that level are taken every 100 pips with default settings and up to order 5 if it retraces 70 pips you close all trades but if you get to order n.6 you will have to wait for a bigger retracement. Thats what i noticed. Stopping for news? Not sure. Maybe if your margin is suffering yes disable if there are big news but that may not save you. Anyway try using what you said and see if you get good results. Its a long time thing. I went live after 1 month of demo testing with this. One good thing that the version im using doesnt have is the open on new candle feature so you put 1 hr chart and you avoid taking trades when there are sudden senseless movements

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Yes open on new candle is the best option to set, it will help to stop the EA if any news hit in middle of candle. Lastweek in one candle more then 50 pips move EURUSD. Are you doing one aud/usd what is max pip moved for last three moth. I am looking for daily,weekly, pips moved on all currency in one chart any one know any indicator please let know

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Aud usd\ moved a lot the days that i started the live test lol.....creating a drawdown from the start. it moved a lot . in a few days something like almost 500 pips.....im still struggling to close those old bad trades having made some mistakes at the start. yesterday i managed to close 2 out of 6 at breakeven (no loss) but thats not related to the EA but still. these day with trump tweeting even if he feels like going to the toilet and the korean nutjob you should expect any currency to behave in a sudden , "painful" &amp; weird way and for almost no reason. well actually reasons are there....

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Sorry my laptop has some technical problem will get that back next week

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I just saw it: my equity just a few minutes ago was 100 euros above initial equity ahaha, thats good and what also good is that balance is about 1912 euros up while i write . But margin is always an issue in general (still ok for me now) . If you screw up with margin you can lose all your profit in a second

--- 帖子 #569 ---
hello, i try this version with open new candle on demo, it seen no prob when you close mt4 and start it again, it will remember last opened trade it post by joan b4 if no wrong 1st 5 distance 100 after 6th 500 7th 1000 after all 2500

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Im wary of changing version dont know what would happen but thanks btw distance 10 pips for the first 5 orders is CRAAAAZY ahaha . I had tried these settings on demo and it blew up after 1 week. I would never do 10 pips orders , i think its simply suicidal, i dont know what other people think about it

--- 帖子 #571 ---
the set is test on 19th Jul till now multiplier 1 &amp; open new candle true H4 time frame attached open &amp; close order

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Thanks, i noticed you re using gbp/jpy that "won the prize" a couple of years ago for being the most trendy pairs of the year... Not that any pair is safe though but still

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Can you please explain the EA settings for small accounts like $1000 and $2000

--- 帖子 #574 ---
maybe with 2000 $ (1000 $ seems too small maybe) i would use 3 pairs(usd\chf, eur\usd and usd\cad) and default settings but not with 100 pipettes between first 5 orders, i would use 500 pipettes. check earlier posts for version im using and explanation

--- 帖子 #575 ---
I sincerely think this EA rocks..... look at my fxbook page again and especially look at the demo test where i didnt intervene, pure profits. the other one(real account) has equity struggling to go above , but still very healthy so far. i could stop the live test now but i dont want to burn 2100 euros profit volunarily(even at no loss) so i will let it run. if situation goes close to zero open trades maybe i would stop the test and start it right away on version that has open trade on new candle and put 30 m tf or 1 hr i would also never touch it , unless it takes double trades (that i would try to close right away) only issue i see with this EA that can blow your account?: 1) FLASH CRASH if you have big trades lots open and a currency has a sudden drop due to crazy algorithm trading or war situation or brexit type of stuff 2) NOT ENOUGH BALANCE and you get MARGIN CALL &amp; STOP OUT other than that this EA can seriously make you money in every month. i ve tried tons of EA , this simple one is so far my favorite ANy comment? edit: well just now while i was writing i lost 300 euros in equity due to bad US data(or CAD announcement).....but it happens often. 5 minutes ago my equity was above intial one usd \cad lost 200 pips in 1 minute...wow

--- 帖子 #576 ---
i will stop posting here because it seems like im talking by myself lol just to say that there was a huge Drawdown with the market last week and had to disable the EA to avoid "bankruptcy". if i hadn't done a mess with the trades manually this (at least this time) wouldnt have happened. now there is a good retracement so what im doing im trying to close all the bad trades at breakeven , hoping it retraces some more. when and if everything stabilizes at good levels i can restart the EA, now its safer to leave it off. my account is still with 2300 euro profit in exactly 2 months.. good luck everybody if you want to follow on myfxbook you re welcome

Would you like to put your hand in the shark's mouth for just 10$? And would you like to do that regularly every f. day?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
If you r doing martingale EA one day you have DD like this that time you need 1000$ has deposite not always. You need keep balance the account by moving it when it needs. Last few days both EURUSD and GBPUSD going mad.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
YeYe, I know, I'm not cons martingale. The point is, we should not leave such a robot in the market all the time. If we do that then we are easy prey for sharks. We have to analyze the market and release the robots only when we have a reliable signal. .... and only then we can wait for profit. ... minimum 300+ pips.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi to all I use the ea as mentioned earlier I use default setting for version 1.4 but changed the lot from 1.5 to 2.5 in order the trades to close quickly. With this i only need around 25 pips retracment. I also use cci 14 periods. With the cci i filter bad trades and i have a bigger winning percentage The account is 2000 euros and i earn around 20€/day I only use eur/usd usd/chf eur/aud The biggest dd i have seen is around 500€ I am using these setting for 2 weeks and have earned around 200€ witout any anxious because bad trades are filtered with the cci, trades closes quickly and do not have to worry for big dd as there are not many. These are conservative settings But are safe!!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Can you share the setting files

Since you have done only for 2 week and you seen 500$ DD that is very risk. I have chnage the setting to 2.5 LOT and CCI to 14 it went to almost 500$ DD in second trade itself. I dont think with this setting it will last Can i know how many pips you mange to retrenchment is it above 300 pips

--- 帖子 #583 ---
27-30 pips. What pair did you trade and you got 500€ dd?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Today it went to 800$ DD i am using "GBPJPY"

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Gbpjpy is the worst pair. It is the most trending pair It will burn you. Use those 3 I told you

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Also you did not understood the settings. The first lot will be 0.02 the multiplier will be 2.5 I saw your lot is 2.5 thats why you have big dd If this is your real account, get out as soon as possible with minimum loss

--- 帖子 #587 ---
thanks i will try this. Can you check my setting is there any thing i need to change. Currently i am getting only 6 to 10$ as profit i dont know why. I use to see it was moving to 300$ profit but TP closing @ 6 to 10$ only why?

--- 帖子 #588 ---
When The profit is set to 5€ this means that when you have 5€ profit the trade will be closed. You get 6-10 profit because you use big lot Close this trade and start again with the settings and pair i told you I assume this account is a demo right?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Yes it is demo right now i need to test this setting for 2 week period. If all goes fine i will do on real R you running this EA 24/7 or running only on specific hour. R you running all three pair in same time. How you manage the SWAP. It is more the profit And on what chart r you running the EA is it on 5M or 1H

--- 帖子 #590 ---
24/7 all at the same time. I watch 1h Dont forget the cci to set at 14

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Yes i was using CCI 14 i am getting profit but same i am hitting the DD also. I am using the same pair only and running 24/7 not monitoring no time to see. Need some advice if i want to monitor what i need to do i need to stop the EA for further taking potion once i reach 500$ DD

Martingale is the best strategy to blow your account, there is no martingale system anywhere I haven't tried but they all fail big time at some point. Don't waste your money and time guys trying to win against the market direction because this is what a martingale system is, it keeps trading against the market flow. Be logic.. you can't win against a whale swimming in one direction while you keep betting that it's gonna change course at any moment and come back, this is suicide.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
i will just give a quick update, i miss writing in this thread. as the person above said martingale is dangerous but so most forex trading even if you don't trade against the flow. part of the EA trades with the flow , the other part against. its an hedging martingale of some sort, or grid martingale at said number of pips decided by us as i said i had a big DD due to my mistakes of closing trades too early manually (and thus not respecting the grid) but at the moment i was able to close many trades because the USD had a big retracement. i plan on restarting the EA soon. so far my banked in profits have been 2260 € in two months (after that i disabled) now equity is above initial deposit for 682 € (see photo). this is on live account my demo test is way in the sky with profits and was never touched. of course for 6 pairs you will need minimum 5000 € im not sure of trading on H1 because sometimes it may open trades too far from other point and take ages to profit. maybe , i say maybe, it wuld be better to put it lower timeframe or no open on new candle feature my live test is on 1 mtf ps upper scrrenshot is live account graph where i said many times mistakes were made by me. second scrrenshot below is demo account never interfered with it, it has been over two months (2 1\2)

--- 帖子 #594 ---
So which version do you use? So you say you made 2260 balance and then blew up?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
No, profit is still there. now its 2170 euro profit in balance . i disabled EA because i had closed trades beforehand and it was a grid mess and now im closing most trades manually when they get closed to breakeven, of course they may not come back but so far i ve closed almost half the trades at almost no loss compared to what it could be. but i still have a big floating loss due to gbp\usd but i may restart EA soon. i was using v1.4 but im analizying a test with v 11 and next time maybe go with that initial balance 4496 euros actual balance 6666 euros actual equity 5240 euros

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Ok, interesting. How do you decide to close the trades earlier? Manually?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
ok this has nothing to do with the EA , i say it here but don't get confused. i have these floating trades , no EA ongoing.... these trades have no stop loss but have a tp at more or less breakeven. these days USD has been retracing consistenstly so what i did i waited until price gets to a good support (or resistance) and try to close an old trade if its at least close to breakeven (little loss). when all trades will be closed on at least 1-3 pairs i will restart the EA and monitor the other trades on the other pairs . infact if i started EA now and some old trades are at very far levels i would screw it up again. i could start on another chart and platform so it wouldnt detect magic number but i would still have those negative trades going on and margin suffering. i dont't know if i was clear

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Ok, so you are scaling in to a Martingale position? Can you give an example? What I understood. A martingale position is open several and the trend is going the wrong direction. So you manually open trades at resistance points and make use of retracement? ?? I guess I am a little confused. :-)

--- 帖子 #599 ---
ok i will try to make it simple eheh i have old trades going on opened by the EA time ago and due to my old mistakes they were not closed properly by the EA(due to my fault) when there was a retracement when i noticed drawdown was too big and there was likely to be a new retracement what j did was to disable the EA and hope that the price would come back to where it was. This is not a strategy but a guess or gambling its just to cut lossess . So basically when i see that my trades are back to the original price i dont wai for them to go in profit but i close them right away. I plan as i said of restarting EA soon when grid will go back to what it was.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Ok, I understand. Makes sense.. :-)

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Now i checked and my equity is 900 euros above initial equity which is good but until the positions are closed you never know : it may go much better or go much worse .but now for example the total quantity of trades open is 0.61 lots At a certain point it was almost 2 lots Edit: i was able to close one more trade at small loss now my total lots floating are 0.58 and my equity above initial equity is 1030 euros i will withdraw now to a sub account 500 euros because its over 5000 (5500) when sub account (not trading) has a minimum of 1000 euros i will withdraw to bank

--- 帖子 #602 ---
i just noticed when EA takes a 0.27 lot trade price has to retrace almost 200 pips for the EA to close other trades and take a profit of 5 $

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi Luca, I am from Rome. Would you just let me know if you have a moment if this, and maybe set otherwise, could work well with the indexes? Thank you very much and have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
didn't see your message notice of reply here, sorry. I can't answer your question but you should try if you have a broker that trades with indexes on mt4 . place the EA on demo and see it acting. Good Luck, buona fortuna. try with a few indexes, not only one and put a balance of 5000 euros here im using 850 euro \pair on average in balance, example 6 forex pairs minimum balance 5000 , thats 833 euro \ pair- ideal would be 1000 or more per pair though Ciao

--- 帖子 #605 ---
For 850 euro \pair. Can i know how much is your ROI and for how many month. What lot size r you running and how many stage MG level you will go for DD

--- 帖子 #606 ---
With 6 pairs you could make around 1000 euros a month or more, also a bit less but most likey around 1000. Estimate DD if you dont make the mistakes that i did by touching the EA you could have a total DD of 40% from new balance (from original balance maybe 30%) this is an estimate and there is no guarantee. you should withdraw profits when it reaches a certain amount ( i would do it at 1000 euros(or in pieces) to a sub account and then bank). I ve been testing this on demo for 4 months and live for 2 . I will restart live with a few pairs, maybe on monday . I want to go back to 6 pairs but im not sure about gbp/usd i start with first level at 0.02 i use default at spaces of 50 pips(500 pipettes) the first 5 orders and then 100 pips (1000 pipettes) for order 6 and then all the others at 200 pips (2000 pipettes). multiplier is 1.5 in my opinion with 6 pairs you should always have 5000 euros in balance (or equity) rolling and never to withdraw to sub account if equity is below 5000. every excess of 5000 in equity you could withdraw. this is for a standard account 1:100 in leverage and 6 pairs for those following me on my fxbook today EA is not on now i'm closing some old trades and i had a few losses today but my profit banked is still 1966 euros but i have to close all the remaining old trades soon. i still have a total of 0.32 lot total trades to go

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Finally closed all my old forgotten trades of the old live test where i had made mistakes. i could have waited more but it would have been a risk and i wanted to restart fresh probably next week. my earnings reduced of course to a total of 1475 euros (from the highest in this test of 2305 eur) . i will withdraw to bank almost 1000 eur and keep 5000 for trading next week. next week i will restart\reset myfxbook from next monday date. because during the last weeks there was no EA trading there so the stats would be unreal link for myfxbook with the old data . notice the last days are all in red. i was just closing bad trades. this same link can be used for next week new live trading follow up https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/mt4-975888/2173946 its worth a note to say that the demo test that was never touched or switched off and i never interfered , started only 3 days later, is still ongoing with a profit of 3259 euros link for myfxbook of the demo test: https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/mt4-2086501/2205656 initial balance\equity 5300 actual balance 8559 actual equity 7198

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Live Trading resumed, same pairs at the end, same EA , v1.4 this myfxbook link data below restarted\refreshed from today. ( 5 hours ago) https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946 i will not touch it. now it cashed 10 euros and has only - 11 euros in floating trades....ahhhh if it was always like this

--- 帖子 #609 ---
so far the EA is functioning correctly(V1.4) with this new live trading test, no double trades have been taken . also vps is a bit faster (better version of amazon aws vps and still free _subscribed again to a fresh new one valid for 12 months eheh) market has ranged these last couple of days. this is the optimal condition for this EA i realized i had posted previously in other earlier posts the wrong links for my demo and real accounts tests for this EA these are the right links: live test (data is very new . it has been reset recently for some reasons explained in other posts but still it went well in past and in profit) https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2173946 demo test: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...086501/2205656 here you have much more data available with almost 3 trading months non stop (24 hs a day)

--- 帖子 #610 ---
How you get the free VPS from my country they r not offering free. Can i know you r from which country

--- 帖子 #611 ---
im from europe. you need a credit card to register even if you will not be charged for the first 12 months. then before expiration you can cancel it https://aws.amazon.com

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I would like to know the best currency pairs to use with this EA.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
thats the 1 million $ question lol....im using 6 pairs but not necessarily the best (or the worst ones). don' t use gbp\jpy (that easily can move 200 pips in ond day lol) the best would be to find ranging pairs with a relatively low spread. saying that a pair is "a ranger" is often misleading. look at what happened to eur\chf in january 2015

--- 帖子 #614 ---
In setting space 2 order Ea open 99 orders ??

--- 帖子 #615 ---
No it means that the next 99 trades will be taken at 200 pips from previous. 99 is an extreme number put there just like that. It means nothing. Unless you have a trillion $ in balance i suspect you will not make it to trade 99 lol

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I've also started a couple of test (this time on demo) with different pairs that have the reputation to be more ranging. about these two tests will let them run for at least a month to see if there is a difference in profit and drawdown (probably there is) and how spread can affect results

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I am running live account last 2 month there was no ranging i was always make Small profit and trend moves in few candle more the 200$ DD. And there is no retracement. I need to stop the martingale wait for the retrace but it move in opp direction. Yes i am planning to do anti-martingale small loss more profit. Any one having experience in live account pls share your feedback

--- 帖子 #618 ---
whats your deposit or capital? If its 1000$ and you re using 1 pair 200$ feels a lot but its not doom yet.... If you have account at 3000$ , 200$ DD is nothing , if you have 5000$ and using 6 pairs 200$ DD is peanuts, trust me whats your account total in $ and how many pairs are you using and what are your settings?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I have two account both i am using cent live from XM and FBS . XM=400$ Opening Balance Account DD went 500$ when i was having profit of 300$ now i have 45$ profit with 120$ DD with two pairs active (GBPUSD ,EURGBP) FBS=550$ Opening Balance Now i have 120$ profit and DD was 440$. Open postion on three pair (EURUSD , EURAUD) opend by EA (AUDJPY) was manual

--- 帖子 #620 ---
even if its cent account (basically 400$ cent account are you risking only 4$??) or its a real 400$ and you have more in cent account. Im not familiar with cebt accounts but i think it will add two zeros right? anyway cent or not 400$ is not enough IMO , minimum should be 800$/1000 $ per pair what are your settings?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
For XM the micro account it will same For FBS =I Have 12K profit and DD was 45k.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
im running the EA on the major (USD pairs), 1M on Axi and H4 on FXDD, both in default settings. i also placed a "close all" EA when the profit reaches $20... We''ll see will it look like in the coming days

--- 帖子 #624 ---
never tried with profit 20 $. it s good that people post here otherwise i feel alone lol. these days the EA is doing great with minimal DD probably because the market is ranging but also because im not touching it lol....also no double trades anymore. vps is faster too. i have the impression that the vps was influencing the performance of the EA (not regarding the strategy but with the bugs). i wonder if a low speed not working well vps can do that. well, it seems it can

--- 帖子 #625 ---
i add another one, FBS, 1min chart..

--- 帖子 #626 ---
the $20 profit EA is of no use hehehehe.. FBS demo is moving a bit slower than Axi and FXDD... I leave my pc open overnight and : FBS closed 3 trades all in profit for $14 but the remaining trades are in -$28... net of - $14 FXDD closed 14 trades with $14 profit but the remaining trades are in -$31.. net of -$17 Axi closed 14 trades with $25 profit and the reaminig trades are in -$22.. net of $3

--- 帖子 #627 ---
5 $ in profit is a good balance. Less greed leas risk. While im trading this live with major pairs im trying two tests with more ranging pairs to see the difference. So far the difference is visible. Profit is less but DD is less too. There is no guarantee that a pair will range all the time. The real risk with this EA (aside from the trend) is the so called "flash crash" . Not having a stop loss risks can be huge a way to limit that is to put a timeframe at lets say 15 m i tried at 1 hr and didnt help because retracement need can be huge but risks of a flash crash affecting te account are reduced. trading with v1.4 that dossnt have the feature "open trade after candle closes" 1 m. Or 1 hr chart makes no difference. Trades are only taken at distance in pips from previous trade the rulee that "the more you risk the more profit you make" clearly applies to this EA. In november i will show here the difference between the tests and the Drawdon

--- 帖子 #628 ---
nice to hear that... I will update you with the performance of this EA maybe this afternoon (Phil Time), it's 8:00 AM here... Maybe at around 6pm..

--- 帖子 #629 ---
by the way Luca1073, what's the difference between the 1.12 v from the 1.4 v? what modification/s was/were made in 1.4 v?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
v1.4 is older. i started using it when the author here had got v1.7 the i couldnt keep up with all the new versions lol. but v11 v 12 have new features, one notable one is to take trades when candle of that particulare timeframe closed and other things. at the end i kept using v1.4 because some people reported bugs in the newer versions between the other things but also v1.4 seemed to have bugs. after changing vps to a better one though i have found no bugs so far

--- 帖子 #631 ---
axitrade 4h v.1.4 = net $11 fbs 1m v.1.4 = net -$21 fxdd 1m v.1.4 = net $3 trader's way 5m v.1.4 = net -$10 vipro 1m v.1.12 = net -$101

Im using pure ECN broker-global prime australia- very tight spreads and standard commissions (0.06 eur* 0.01 lot) very honest broker an thry re interested that you are profitable to keep trading and paying commissions so no conflict of interests

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I started using the EA the other day and it's done pretty well .. just wondering if there is a version that doesn't open a new trade automatically when the other trades close. I am in U.S. so can't hedge, thus I have a template that is to only buy and another to only sell .. would prefer to evaluate market once my trades close before jumping in again the same direction. all in all this has worked well for me so far. thanks to joancb for sharing it

--- 帖子 #634 ---
i have a complete dislike for all governments but the Usa one definitely tops my list (top 5) .... One of the least free countries on earth. Im in no way politically correct because they re not in the first place Aside from politics i think you need to code a different EA . You have the mq4 file and can ask a coder to make it for you but that will not be this EA because this is based on hedge

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Thanks Luca .. I can work around it, just wondered if any other versions had the feature . seems the original member who posted this doesn't really follow this thread anymore ?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
yes probably joan still looks at the thread out of curiosity but doesn't post anymore. maybe he doesn't believe in it. i don't know, pure speculation from my part lol he gave us a good simple EA and i can only thank him . even if in the future we will lose money is not his fault. im completely aware of the risks i don't think there is any version that has the feature that you talk about. it must be complicated for you to make it work like that, openeing two charts at same time. at the end you re hedging anyway. these rules are useless....people always find ways and thats how it should be , never be hostage of anybody or anything sorry i can't help you with this because i'm not a coder. but there are thousands of coders in this forum so maybe someone will pick up your wish\request i can help you with my tests, statements and feelings. this thing has a martingale component so many people stay away from it and name it the "devil" ahah at the end all forex is very risky anyway. let s hope for the best

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Personally, I dont mind using martingale systems. Currently I am testing a new one with 3 pairs. EURUSD, NZDUSD, AUDCHF 5k Deposit and decent returns so far. It opens in both directions and uses martingale systems to end a trade sequence.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I am running AUDJPY in FBS live account will update. But from my last testing EURAUD i stopped the martingale after 15 level so got lost 120$ because of DD. Now i going to risk up to 30 levels will see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
mine is running on the major pairs in 4H TF with AxiTrader.. so far, so good.... up by $30+ in 2days. default setting.. other TF are not that good..

--- 帖子 #640 ---
thats similar to this. Curiosity: whats the multiplier ratio ? X 2? Here i use default 1.5

--- 帖子 #641 ---
15 levels??? What do you mean lol? How often (at how many pips levels ) does the EA take trades? Do you have as a setting 100 pipettes (10 pips)? That s very bad 10 pips in my opinion is suicidal

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Maximum Lot=10.0 Lot Multipler=1.5 Maximum umber of positions=100 Pips Multiplier=10 Grid step, pips=30

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Thanks. that means that every 10 pips in the wrong direction it will multiply 1.5? i agree with 1.5 but i find multiplying at 10 pips very risky. just my opinion. if it works for you i'm happy

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Maximum number of positions=30 each side TP=4 pips Grid step, pips=8 pips (Open position on new candle)

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Is somebody using the EA on a real account? Is it safe? is it best to use 1.4 or 1.12 atached to the first post? thanks

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Yep, because im using it on a 15m chart and the selected pairs range so recovery is quite fast. But there is a built in function where it will not open 2 positions on a single candle stick. So if it trends fast then it will adapt accordingly.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Sorry i deleted my message question because i found the answer a few posts earlier , thanks

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I use 1.4 on a real account. Safe for what? The strategy or the EA as a program? As a program it seems reliable and also the strategy it uses, but saying it s "safe" in forex is a bit underestimating the risks

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Today i have risked 90$ to make profit of 7.7$ After one week of run i have made 7.7$ Number of positions opened=33 sell MAX Lot size reached is 3.42 LOTS (EURAUD Now all position closed) TP=4 pips Grid step, pips=4 pips (Open position on new candle using M15) Since i used Cent account the Draw down went to 9000$ to make profit of 770$ ~ i get 10% profit from the risk. So if i want to make 100$ i need to risk 10K to 20K if i use standard account. Any one provide your thought and experience. i can't imagine to risk in standard account.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
i dont know about your calculations, you talk about grid step but im using v1.4 and i dont remember if there was a grid step i can tell you my starting trade is 0.02 , default settings on v 1.4 i use 6 pairs, multiplier 1.5 (, i use a standard account of 5000 euros.) pairs are not the trendiest ones but not even the most ranging ones. my profit in balance usually are around 1000 euros a month. everything that goes above 5000 in equity i withdraw it to subaccount (not trading) when sub account reaches a balance of 1000 euros i withdraw to bank while EA keeps working on the trading account in your screenshot i see trades of 3.2 lots(??) thats a lot of money lol if you used a standard account you would need a lot of balance maybe 50000 euros. i think the dsitance between trades in your case is too tight, thats the impression i get, very very risky. am i wrong? even if you risk in cent account thats the same ratio but you re using way too much risk. i wouldnt use your settings, not even if the account was 5 euros

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Can i know what is your Grid size (i mean space) and chart hour you have used. Since i am using M15 and Grid is 4 pips for 150 pips move it was opened ~ 33 position

I think its more about pair selection... Mine is not bad https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/341891

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Can i know r you using cent account or standard account "EURUSDf" Why showing suffix has "f". I think broker is also key player. Can i know what broker r you using I am quite confused on selecting the pair. Which is best EURAUD AUDJPY or EURUSD GBPUSD EURGPB

--- 帖子 #654 ---
timeframe is not important in my case because it only calculates pips. v1.4 doesn't have that feature (open trade on new candle) 33 positions (martingale levels?)??? thats nuts. i wouldn't even consider it. your settings are wrong. of course even my settings can fail badly but yours are very very risky. im using default settings of this v1.4 attached here on 6 pairs. values are in pipettes (500 pipettes is 50 pips for the first 5 orders) 6 th order is 100 pips away from 5th order and 7 th order is 200 pips away from 6 th order. after that all 200 pips away from previous order.

37.07% DD of the account. Still within acceptable parameters. That's the point with martingale systems. If you want a low DD, martingale really isn't for your risk appetite. Because once it trends hard, you're in for a ride.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
True

--- 帖子 #658 ---
From the trade i can able to see it went to ~320 pips DD. If the trend goes more the 500 pips DD will it able to retrace back to Basket TP. Till what level we can manage the trend to run till 500 pips for 5K deposit

If you get margin call will you add more fund to the same account or level the account to blow and start with new account with 5K deposit

--- 帖子 #661 ---
This account is running purely based on profits that i initially started with. So to answer that question, I will just let it blow up. Its like playing black jack with the house money. Always know when to quit.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi Lucas I studied your myfxbook and i have made some notices 1. You have a dd of 1200€ which is much but not too much for you 5000€ balance (20%) 2. Some trades are opened for more than 5 days and the question is when they will be closed (i saw usd/cad from 18/10) 3. I liked lots are not too high because when you have high lot then you are in risk As i had told you before i use cci 14 and multiplier 2.5 Th advantage is that most of the time the dd is minimum 30-100€ and trades are closing quickly The disadvantage is when a pair is trending lots are going high and i have big dd. Last week on Eur/Aud the dd came at 1500€ (balance with the profits 3000€) and to tell you the truth i believed that finally it will blow my account. Fortunattely the eur went down and closed all trades. I need around 30pips to close all trades. When you are in 5th step how many pipis do you need? I am thinking to start over with the default settings as you. What is your opinion for all those i told uou and what is your advice. Are you happy with your settings dd and lots?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Zakgr, thanks for checking my stats and giving your opinion. i think both my settings and your settings are definitely not the safest anyway being a martingale strategy but personally i would go with mine. i have seen a drawdown of 1700 euros on usd\cad with my settings too so far and it can go worse for sure if other pairs trend too. if you then interfere with the EA by closing trades manually early the one in profits but not the far ones leaving grid too open (dont do it) your DD can easily go at 3000 euros on a 5000 account . that pair (USD CAD) trended like crazy for 7 days in a row with zero retracement. at the end a rumour about trump choosing a chairman for FED over another and finally USD went down a bit (hence "only" -1142 DD) but when you have a 0.18 or 0.27 lot open on a couple of pairs the DD adds up quiclkly and crazily. imagine with multiplier 2.5 that goes even worse but its true what you say that even a small retracement in your case will help but what about the margin in %? you can blow your account also due to margin call and with high lots margin goes down fast too .... i find my settings more balanced for the price swings but saying they re safe is not really true. i find them safer than yours maybe. and i like the settings i use and the lots starting at 0.02 and multiplier at 1.5(default). i ve seen trends in the past with aud\usd and usd\cad but other pairs can trend at any time , even usd\chf is trending a lot theses days , so you never know. Good luck

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I aggree with you. The default setting are a little more relaxing. But I back tested the usdcad with my setting and saw the trades would have been closed. The lots though came to 0.83 but closed . Take in mind also that I use cci (14 periods) and if i use my setting with cci the lots will be 0.13 I don't know what to think! My setting are risky but safe? Default settings not so risky but not very safe Take a look at my setting I don't know what to choose PS my settings: cci:14, multiplier:2.5, spaceorder for 50pips 4, 1 for 100 1 for 2000 and then pray hahah

--- 帖子 #665 ---
ahah we ll pray yes by the way i dont know why but backtesting never worked for me. Or i never had good data to start with or the spread affects result (spread on mt4 tester is autogenerated in set amount by you... That can fake real reaults too.. i agree that 0.84 lot goes fast in DD....thats why it recuperates so fast.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
i noticed a bug \error in myfxbook not related to the EA but to my fxbook. it says that in my test since october 9 i have had a drawdown of approx 50 % but thats not true(at least not yet). infact i checked an indicator of min max equity and the lowest equity was 3587 on an account of 5000 thats definitely not 50% even adding the profits that so far since oct 9 are 720 euros. there are other tools on myfxbook that are unreal like the risk of ruin. not really useful as they dont give the real extent of the risk. if i had to follow or believe whats written there then this strategy should be invincible lol

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Luca, I went through some hard experiences that I will spare you, but from what I understood myfxbook is reliable about DD, but only on the window at the left, with all other "Stats" "abs. gain" "Daily" and so on. There it registers the max DD that happened even if only for a fraction of seconds, not at the end of the candle or the end of the day (as it happens on the tab "Drawdown). I do not know if your indicator calculates the DD only at the end of the candle or not, but I have the suspect that yes.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Thanks for your reply my candle is one minute(only pips are important in this EA version: v1.4) and no it doesnt calculate at the end of the candle. its the actual drawdown. i will attach here the indi if anynoe finds it useful. i suspect myfxbook may have gone back in history and added a drawdown from a previous test on the same account "without my consent" lol. dont know. but im 100 % sure minimum equity since October 9 was 3587 euros. maximum balance including profit would be 5720 so thats not 50 %.....yes i know about the tab drawdown (the other one) and how it works, i noticed but thanks for pointing that out

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Been observing and analyzing this EA a lot and putting real money in it. If you start with 0.02 lots you will need 30 pip retracement for the first 2 steps approzx then i think from 0.05 to 0.08 lot you will need 50 pip retracement to cash in and if you get to 0.12 you will need 60 pip retracement (always if pip value is 0.10 $ / 0.01 lot infact some pairs pip value is lower so you will need a bigger retracemenr) for 0.18 i think you will need 100 pip retracement but i will need to analyze more all trades. I noticed once on a 0.27 lot trade (maximum ever taken so far ) a 200 pip retracement was needed to cash in. If you set profit at 5 $ as in default settings. Also commissions and swap fees are not calculated before close so you could end up with a small negative close

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Last two days i am doing two pair hedging not using TP setting let it run till i get basket profit. Take position only on loss after 30 pips getting profit will how it works

--- 帖子 #671 ---
comeback2000 its already set like this there is no tp in this EA only basket profit then closed automatically wow those are some huge lots. is that demo or live?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Inserted Code wow those are some huge lots. is that demo or live? I am using cent account

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Yes but i am taking position on one direction martingale (Sell,BUY,BUY)

--- 帖子 #674 ---
everything was going smooth on little martingale until a stupid shutdown of the vps im using caused the EA not to close trades and reopen others (when i renitiated) not respecting the settings. basically its as if you restart from first lot but it will open if last was a 0.12 lot after 50 pips only took a 0.18 lot. its a mix of a bug with a non working vps, so i disabled for now usd\chf and closed 0.18 lot with a "small" loss. still going great but these happenings risk of putting evertyhing in jeopardy. a good vps should be the norm in this case and never touching the EA. i had to touch it anyway because the platform had shutcown and had to do it. also maybe i will have to substitute if possible and when possible pairs USD\Cad and Usd|Chf with something else because swap fees on sell trades are too high creating loss when in profit when big sequences are closed

Right now my pairs are trending so I will be in a drawdown for quite some time. You can track all the accounts on my profile page

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Good that you share , thanks from what i can see at first glance we have sinilar balance but maybe your trades use the multiplier at less pips apart from each level? I use 50 pips distance for the first 5 trades then 6 th trade is 100 pips away and 7 trade is 200. I start from lot 0.02

--- 帖子 #678 ---
i fixed myfxbook page (now viewable in my profile page here). myfxbook said i had a drawdown of 50% since oct 9 which was not true. i just refreshed once on the custom analysis and my real 25% DD came up. that's how low it went since oct 9.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hi Lucas I am watching your fxbook. I think i will also start with default settings as my settings are very dangerous . Look at eurusd which trended yesterday. It is at 4th step. Tell my any news you have. What is the biggests dd? Around 1000€? I think you added 2 more pars audnzd and eurgbp? I have around 3000 in my account Do you think I should start with eurusd and usdchf or add one more and which? Wish you all low dd and big profits

--- 帖子 #680 ---
im from mobille cannot write well. Biggest drawdown was around 2000 euros in another test but if you make mistakes by closing manually before even 3000 be careful expect 30-38% drawdown on 6 pairs and 5000 account hi Zakgr, thanks for the message. Yes i would follow default settings so far it has been going good. I put aud nzd and eur gbp but eliminated usd chf and usd cad to avoid high swap fees that were eating profits. There are still two trades of usd cad just waiting until close but the EA is not active on that pair. I always have 6 pairs and would not put more on a 5000 euros account, Thanks!! Good luck to you too!!

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Guys ! Just found this thread and as i have a weakness for martingale ea's i was very happy to see that the author shared the source code. Is he back already and working on it again ?? If not.. i would be happy to see if i can fix any open bugs and/or add new features. If you guys could explain the current bugs/issues with UnNomGuaiV1.12 then i'll take a look at it and try to fix it

--- 帖子 #682 ---
thanks for your availabilty . Im using v1.4 but all versions seemed to have aome sort of issue. EA doesnt respect settings if restarted(platform crash or reboot) that means if you reload platform EA will take trades at levels as if it had just started but only at pip levels. Example you are at 0.12 step. And you have as setting that next trade will be taken at 100 pips. Well EA will take it 50 pips later only as if it was the first trade. Sequence in lot amount is respected. In the past i had noticed issues on double trades also . Thanks for the help, by the way as you may have guessed i like this EA!

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Ok here is a new version ! Fixed the following issues - cleaned up source code - Fixed issues that ea could open new trades outside time filter - Fixed issues when you have some other ea on another chart, but on the same currency pair - Fixed issues which happened if you had this ea running on multiple charts simultaneously - Fixed issue that EA did not remember settings after crash/reboot/restart - added small info panel so you can monitor the state of the EA - added feature where you can choose between fixed initial lot size or dynamic initial lot size, where initial lot size depends on a max risk % of your account And.. i've started work on a 2nd entry method. At the moment you can choose between - option 1) open 1 buy and 1 sell at startup and see which one survives, - option 2) use the cci for determining entry. What i would like to add is a signal based on the SMA7 and the parabolic SAR. When parabolic SAR &lt; SMA then we open a sell, when parabolic SAR &gt; SMA7 then we open a buy. Perhaps this helps to get a better entry Happy testing and let me know if you guys have more requests!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
AMAZING!!! thank you so much ebeckers will make some tests with it . Right now i have 1.4 running so im scared to change it wirh v12 i dont have source code for 1.4 not even Joan has it but i guess v12 is similar if you don't use those inputs at the start of the fixed lots at levels. Anyway will test, you are really good and kind Luca

--- 帖子 #685 ---
something else ebeckers i ve installed the new version you shared (v1.13) on a fresh new vps. if i put spacelot to 0 will it just calculate the lot from the MM set to true with 0.02 and multiplier 1.5 and basket profit of 5 ?. basically i want the EA to start at lots 0.02 and multiply from 0.02 at increments of 1.5 only(like v1.4) with no extra feature but i want to test yours to see how it behaves when platform reboots or crashes increments every 50 pips (500 pipettes): first order: 0.02 second order:0.03 third order: 0.05 fourth order: 0.08 fifth order: 0.12 increment after 100 pips (1000 pipettes) sixth order : 0.18 increment after 200 pips (2000 pipettes) seventh order: 0.27 ------------- after 0.27 i would disable the EA on that particular trending pair by unticking allow live trading and "wait" for price to go back....lol plaese have a look at sreenshot about the settings that i ve put and tell me if in your opinion the EA would perform like i said with these settings. probably not, but i ask, Thanks a lot again

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I like martingales will try and get back with results Cheers !!!

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Good question luca! Please set - MM = false - lotsize= 0.02 - multiplier = 1.5 and then your other settings like spacing etc.. Then it should work. But will test it myself just 2 b sure Only set MM=true if you want to use a dynamic initial lot size which is based on your account balance and the % risk you want. And please set lot digits when using MM=true

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I will do it now, so it will be ready for monday! Thanks

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Ok just did a simple test myself with following settings: MM : false lot size : 0.02 spacePips : 10pips space1Pips : 50pips multiplier: 1.5 As you can see in the screenshot it opened - 1 buy trade and 6 sell trades - sell trade #1-#5 are each 10 pips apart with lot sizes 0.02 , 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.12 - and sell trade #6 opened at 50 pips distance with lot size 0.18 So i think it works nicely :- Release notes of 1.131: settings.. Please note.. The spacing is now in PIPS and not in points anymore . So spacePips=10 means 10 pips !! settings... Added 2nd entry method based on SMA/parabolic (still beta and experimental) EA will now work ok on 3,4,5 digit brokers Fixed some small bugs where GUI panel show incorrect profit due to swap/commissions not being accounted for Added some more info to the GUI panel EA will now show error window if any of the settings are not correct (like trying to use a lot size of 0.0004) more code cleanup

--- 帖子 #690 ---
ok i had some issues with a vps, the new one i opened today is not working well. better to terminate the istance and put a new one with this version, thanks!!. will ask questions if somthing is not clear to me

--- 帖子 #691 ---
if i want fixed lots of o.o2 , 0.03 ,0.05 , o.08. 0.12 etc at my desired pip levels i have to put 0 in spacelots?

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Ok let me try to explain how it works now. If we can all understand this then we can see if this is what we want, or if we need changes. At the moment you have 2 options with this EA.. 1) Use a multiplier to calculate to lot-size 2) Don't use a multiplier and set the lot-sizes yourself manually 1) Using the multiplier to calculate the lot size Condition : multiplier &gt; 0 In this case the multiplier is used to calculate lot size for each trade So spaceLots (space1Lots, space2Lots, space3Lots) are not used in this case Example lets say multiplier=1.5, lot size=0.02, spaceOrders=2, space1Orders=3, space2Orders=4, space3Orders=99 then: -- Starting 2 orders since spaceOrders=2 -- Trade #1 : 0.02 (initial lot size) Trade #2 : 0.03 (=0.02 * 1.5) Opened spacePips from trade #1 -- Next 3 orders since space1Orders=3 -- Trade #3 : 0.05 (=0.03 * 1.5) Opened space1Pips from trade #2 Trade #4 : 0.08 (=0.05 * 1.5) Opened space1Pips from trade #3 Trade #5 : 0.12 (=0.08 * 1.5) Opened space1Pips from trade #4 -- Next 4 orders since space2Orders=4 -- Trade #6 : 0.18 (=0.08 * 1.5) Opened space2Pips from trade #5 Trade #7 : 0,27 (=0.18 * 1.5 )Opened space2Pips from trade #6 Trade #8 : 0,40 (=0.40 * 1.5) Opened space2Pips from trade #7 Trade #9 : 0,60 (=0.60 * 1.5) Opened space2Pips from trade #8 -- Next 99 orders since space3Orders=99 -- Trade #10 : 0,9 (=0.60 * 1.5) Opened space3Pips from trade #9 .... 2) Don't use the multiplier Condition : multiplier = 0 Lotsize is set only by spaceLots (space1Lots, space2Lots, space3Lots) multiplier is NOT used in this case Example lets say: lot size:0.02, spaceOrders=2 space1Lots=0.04, space1Orders=3 space2Lots=0.08, space2Orders=4 space3Lots=0.12, space3Orders=99 -- Starting 2 orders of 0.02 since lotsize=0.02 and spaceOrders=2 -- Trade #1 : 0.02 #1 Trade #2 : 0.02 #2 Opened spacePips from trade #1 -- Next 3 orders of 0.04 since space1Orders=3 and space1Lots=0.04 -- Trade #3 : 0.04 #1 Opened space1Pips from trade #2 Trade #4 : 0.04 #2 Opened space1Pips from trade #3 Trade #5 : 0.04 #3 Opened space1Pips from trade #4 -- Next 4 orders of 0.08 since space2Orders=4 and space2Lots=0.08 -- Trade #6 : 0.08 #1 Opened space2Pips from trade #5 Trade #7 : 0.08 #2 Opened space2Pips from trade #6 Trade #8 : 0.08 #3 Opened space2Pips from trade #7 Trade #9 : 0.08 #4 Opened space2Pips from trade #8 -- Next 99 orders of 0.12 since space3Orders=99 and space3Lots=0.12 -- Trade #10: 0.12 #1 Opened space3Pips from trade #9 ... Hope this explains it a bit

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi friends, on my weekend I wanted to make tests on this . Now on the last EA post in Gu 15 minutes has nice move on default. But I can not again trade with higher lots . I set to true MM it did not help. I set lot sizes manually higher it did not help. I played around with the LotDigits and did not help unfortunately. What I am doing wrong ? and can not go higher. I know I am not specailizst with this EA, since I am not a long time reading this thread, but increasing lot size wouldn't be so complicated ) I am diabetic, maybe I have much hunger and can not thing correctly.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Just use the default settings and then change the Lots (default=0.02) to whatever you want.. (If you set MM = true then lotsize is calculated automatically based on your account balance and the Risk..)

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Thanks, I understand you very well but the results are very different, please see the charts and sets of all 3 options, on the last 2 screens even spikes. There should be a big problem and can not increase lot size as same from the default BT result Default set :110 trades 115 usd win and DD 2.2% chart below Attached Image (click to enlarge) My Change form 0.02 lots to 0.2 lots : 335 trades 348 usd win and DD 48% chart below Attached Image (click to enlarge) My Change MM true others default started to trade with 0.1 lots by 5000 balance: 205 trades 297 usd win and DD 24% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #696 ---
If you increase the lot size you will reach your profit quicker and thus will open new trades quicker.. As an example Suppose with default settings of 0.02 lots and profit of $5 - it opens a trade of at 00:00 - it reaches a $5 profit at 01:00 But when you use a lotsize of lets say 0.08 - it opens a trade of at 0 0:00 - it reaches a $5 profit at 00:30 This means it will start opening new trades already at 00:30 and these could become losers and thus the quicker you will encounter spikes. Spikes are quite normal with martingale. I see them using the default settings as well. Just backtest GBPUSD from 1/1/2017 - 31/1/2017 on M15 and you will see them

--- 帖子 #697 ---
ok thanks again for the detailed explanation, amazing

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Voila, now all is fine. Thank you much

--- 帖子 #699 ---
ebeckers, sorry again me. I have the similar problem on Autop, if you please can help me out of that too it would be great, thank you much , it isnt the correct thread, sorry too all

Did some backtesting today with v1.132 using 99.9% modelling tick data with variable spreads , commissions and slippage currency pair : GBPUSD timeframe : M15 settings : see attached period : 1-jan-2016 / 11-nov-2017 Note that i used pretty 'save' settings for this test, thats why it survived a 2 years backtest. You can earn much more with more riskier settings, but then it probably won't survive 2 years.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
what is the pip TP and SL here?

--- 帖子 #668 ---
No SL here . Tp neither but in this case would the amount in $ necessarily for the basket of trades to close. Often it is 30 pips to 200 (in case of 0.27 lots) an default settings on v1.4

--- 帖子 #669 ---
what data do you use? I found that backtesting in the past didn't bring me anything good. Maybe i had bad data or don't know what. I had things surviving a year in backtest and blowing for real after 2 days (lol) and now im not referring about this EA or martingales

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hello "ebeckers" why the function-tradesperday when it is = 1 only takes Buy, = 0 does not take any operations, but with all the other numbers it just takes as much as it does. If you can fix it to take the specified number of operations per day and if it is set 1 to take one operation and wait the next day. Of course, during this time the robot is working on the operation taken to exit, then if it is within the day does not make a second entrance. The next entrance is the next day or the hours specified for the job, of course if you have left the last entrance. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Ok i will have a look. Anyway its always good to hear you backtested and it gave you good results

--- 帖子 #672 ---
i downloaded the trial version and im downloading data for many pairs. thanks for the tip ebeckers you seem a very helpful person

--- 帖子 #673 ---
sorry to bother you again ebeckers. i downloaded data in csv files (excel) as the program you advised does and i cannot import it in history center in mt4. it doesnt load it, it gets frozen. did you have the same problem at the start? how did you fix it? if anyone else also has this problem with csv files and knows a solution please let me know. i tried to convert it in another knd of file but it didnt work

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hello sir please provide me set files with multiplier and without multiplier Thanks

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Sorry but i have no idea luca1073 i just started tick data suite manager , downloaded data for several pairs and after that it magicly appeared in the strategy tester in MT4.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
ok thanks maybe there is an action i havent done and maybe it will appear here too, thanks

--- 帖子 #677 ---
For 'ebeckers", can the counter of the day's operations have a sub-count. For example: tradesperday = 2 / tradebuy = 1 and tradesell = 1 /

--- 帖子 #678 ---
let's make a survey: how many of you are trading with this EA live? if you are one of those please like my comment or reply. i'm curious lol

--- 帖子 #679 ---
thank you for EA + 'save' set ebeckers Because this EA use "Close on Profit" method for the basket of trades to close, i hope you can add some function to put TP+SL for open trade and "Close x pips after Break Even Point" function for the basket of trades to close. Thanks in advance. #sory for my bad english

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Not this version but a similar EA. I busted 1 account and now still going on the other 2.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Dear Sir I were using old version 1.12 from first page....today i got an problem that EA stops opening new trades..Please guide as that version suits me well

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi my friend Have you put on your live trade the new ea of ebecker? I put it on a demo account and seems ok Have you test it?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
hi i used this EA,result is good,but the only problem is some trades can not be closed because of FIFO violation, any solution for that? regards fred

--- 帖子 #684 ---
yes i have a solution. give up your usa citizenship (just in case you re american) or ...easier....chang broker . i use global prime but if you are american they will not accept you. now you know it. Usa is far from being a free country. luckily im not from there if this keeps making money as it is doing with decent drawdown if (and when) it will reach 5000 euro profit i will create a second account of 5000 euro with different pairs to diversify risk and try doubling my profits per month.

Hi luca1073 till now there is no major issue in DD. Can i know for 5K how many pair you r running three right.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
i was running : eur \usd aud\usd usd\jpy gbp\usd usd\chf usd\cad then i changed usd\cad and usd\chf with eur\gbp and aud\nzd these above are the 6 pairs on live account i have other pairs on test on demo account. a mix of ranging pairs in 2 tests going great with DD less than 20 % so far but less profits but it seems good i have a mix of nzd\cad eur /gbp aud /nzd. eur/usd is always in the tests

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi luca1073, I am using below pair. Current i am 400$ DD with 230$ profit. Waiting for retrace eur/gbp- BUY and gbu/usd-Sell. eur/usd, eur/gbp gbu/usd

--- 帖子 #724 ---
out of curiosity what settings are you using and what version? i now have -158 € DD only as i write

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Hi luca1073, I am not using the same EA i using differ but same martingale. I am going to use once i close all the with profit

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Hi Lucas Do you use the ea of Jonas 1.4 or the new of ebeckers 1.131?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
still using Joan's v1.4 for now

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Who knows we might just have been lucky with little martingale or maybe this Ea or settings are worth of a "little" grail prize i dont trust backtests mine is a pure forward testing operation done with real money having tested tons of stuff this is not boring for me its actually repetive results in a positive constant similar way. forgot to say im a really stubborn person and keep trying until my job or intention is completed lol

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Hi Ebecekrs The upadted ea is very good. I use it in live but witout your settings. I use the defaults of Jonas i was thinking if you could add the multiplier inside the steps For example I want the first 5 steps to have multiplier 1.5 and the next 2 step to have multiplier 2 and the next 3 steps to have multiplier 2.5 Can you make it? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hi ebeckers, I try your EA on multiple pairs with different Magic Numbers. Default settings on H1. So far, so good. First it started trades on every pair and closed most of them in the desired profit (8$). Since yesterday no new cycle is opened. Could this depend on the market conditions or is there any counter in the code, that could stop transactions? Thx for your help.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
My impression is that both Joan and ebeckers lost interest in this EA. Martingale scares or puts off many but at the end market is not safer if you don't trade martingale or any other strategy. Also i think most computer geeks (they probably are) rely a lot on backtests and "perfection". There is no " perfection" or better "there is perfection" and that is a market dance and we have to hedge up and down and thats what this EA does guessing exactly where the market will go is a dream but predicting where it may go and at what average level will /may retrace is possible

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi, I think it can be a good EA if money management is good and we play on specific pairs which are correlated with each others. I am testing it but the only problem is if market opens in gap this EA stops working. It puts several trades and stops. Can you help me to resolve it? Thanks Shivafx

--- 帖子 #733 ---
if there is a gap trades will be taken at different levels and so profita but it works. Now im referring to the original from joan. I dont know the new one i will check that out

--- 帖子 #734 ---
I use the new ea for a week and i have no problem ! Why you say there is a problem? Show us an exsmple

Hi zakgr, example till friday my grid on usdjpy was going fine but on monday due to some gap levels changed however i didn't removed the EA but i placed a sell on above level but yesterday after my sell hit TP another gap came so all my trades closed and around 10 trades of 0.01 buy sell were placed after that no trades on USDJPY was open and EA stopped working. Zakgr could you please also attach the latest one here I have worked for many brokers and have seen martingale EA always required some manual intervention if we want to make profit for a longer term

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Hello dear when I use this ea on my metatrader on 15chart with multi pairs, I get attached error. this page always running without stopping. what can I do to make it stopping ?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
If you put suspendtrades to true in settings/inputs it will stop taking trades on that particular pair when basket is closed

--- 帖子 #738 ---
My friend, you mean if I make suspendtrades "true" then it will stop give this error to me ?

--- 帖子 #739 ---
no that action only if you want the EA to stop taking trades on a particular pair if you have an error it could be for many reasons including (but not limited) to your broker (or residence country).are you american?

Go to #701 and download this ea The one you use has many bugs!! 1.132 is the last

--- 帖子 #741 ---
i have been using little martingale EA since before my son was born ( he's 6 months old now ) on demo and soon after he was born on live account and so far it has made only profits. only scare, so far, was when i ihad intervened in a bad way manually at the start . i used v1.4 and default settings. v.13.1 seems very good so far on demo but i use the very basic settings of v1.4. the screenshot here is on a fresh new test on live account that i started oct 9. drawdown has been minimal or not so minimal but for me a 25 percent DD is acceptable did other people profit regularly with this or its only me ?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi What broker r you using i have profit same time 50% DD not using same script.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I'm using Global prime , australian Ecn forex broker, very recommended

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hey Luca, I am on the demo run since beginning of this month. So far profits are good. I stopped two demo accounts after Manual intervention before. Now I wait and see. I am using 1.132 on 15 pairs and with the standard settings. Most positions and biggest DD I had on the pairs EURAUD and GBPNZD. Would you tell us which pairs you use? Thank you BTW: What is the difference between 1.4 and 1.132? I know there is an Explanation in the thread, but where?

--- 帖子 #745 ---
thanks for the info. 15 pairs seems risky to me unless you have a huge account. the difference between 1.4 and 1.13.2 is in its variety of settings and the code. v1.4 was one of the oldest versions with basic settings-and good- and there are some minor bugs. while v13.2 should be relatively bug free and with more options .i posted v1.4 before in this thread multiple times. if you find it , download it place it on chart and check my settings. i dont know what settings you re using. i would personally use v13.2 only because it has been fixed and free of bugs probably but with th settings of v1.4 and so i v placed it on demo on a vps and doing well so far. only problem with v1.4 is if you restart the platform due to a computer or vps crash the orders at grid levels are not respected . i did demo with little martingale EA only for one month in june 2017. aftre that in july i went live, then stopped in august september for some mistakes i did then restarted in october. it s going great

--- 帖子 #746 ---
sorry realized i forgot to answer one of your questions and that is what pairs do i use now i use eur/usd usd/jpy aud/usd aud/nzd eur/gbp gbp/usd

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Thank you for your reply. I have 15 pairs running on the demo account in order to have an idea where I have the biggest DD before going live. After this I plan to have a look where are the most profitable pairs and which pairs make me afraid the most. I will use 1.132 because till now ist running without problems, even after restarting the platform (I do this every Weekend)

--- 帖子 #748 ---
also in your test check about the spread that you re given for the pairs by your broker and very importtant are the swap fees even if on one side . One Example is the usd/chf where swap fees are very high and can eat your profits if trades are open too long . A bad pair is also usd/cad

--- 帖子 #749 ---
as discussed in message bullilulli i pass you here in screenshots the settings for v13.1 adapted from v1.4, its two screenshots

--- 帖子 #750 ---
I use the 1.1320 on live account and i had no problem yet. The best thing with this ea is that when you restart the mt4 it does not loose the trades. 1.4 had this problem 1.131 i think has some bug because one time in gbpusd did not close my trade when profit reached 5€ I only use eurusd,usdchf,audusd I use the default settings as Jonas first introduced and Lucas shows above!

--- 帖子 #751 ---
thanks for the feedback. If i put another live account at work it will definitely be with v13 version everything great with this EA , been testing it demo and live since two weeks after this thread was created

--- 帖子 #752 ---
I think i found a bug with 1.132 version. When you put true to suspend trades. The ea halts and does not close trades even if they are in profit. Can anyone confirm this? Can eblecker fix this please? With 1.4 when you put true to suspend trades. The ea trades until it reach its goal which is the profit. The 1.132 just stop calculations even if trades are in profit So if you want to stop trades you must either close trades in losses or trade manually

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Goodmorning everyone I can read in English but when I write I am a bad translator, so I will use the google translator, hoping that you can understand the meaning of what I think. First of all thanks to Joancb and Ebeckers, one for opening the thread and the other for the refinement of the EA. I like Luca1073 use v1.4 and I think I will use v13.1 with the sets identical to v1.4 (post Luca1073 # 749). I was on demo in October (deposit € 500 - Equity closing demo € 728 -GU / EU / EG original set) and in November (deposit € 5.000 - Equity closing demo € 5.702 -GU / EU / EG - lot GU / EU 0.03 EG 0.02). In both cases, very low DD, while the maximum floating DD of November was at most € -300 but with equity higher than the initial deposit. From 11/12/2017 i'm are in live account(ECN leva 1: 200) with an initial deposit of € 2.020 always with lot GU / EU / EG lot 0.02. Here I have always been with positive equity (or at most under a few euros), a maximum floating DD of around € -150. Last night I closed all negotiations DD undergoing a total of about € -37, I did it to avoid flash problems during the holidays, and in any case now I have a budget of equity = € 2208.15. I know that Joancb no longer follows the thread and maybe even Ebechers, but I try to launch an idea to improve the Hedge part of the system. The hypothesis with the original set with 50pips space for 5 steps (etc), TP at 5 € ($ £), with initial lot of 0.02 and multi 1.5. Now if we have a down trend, a series is exclusively regulated to perform the following steps with BUY orders of a size greater than 1.5 with respect to the previous one; 0.02-0.03-0.05-0.08-0.12-0.18 etc. The Hedge part will be of orders SELL with a size equal to the martingale (0.02) always closed with a TP € 5 which in my account corresponds to about 30 pips from the beginning of the sequence. When the SELL is closed, an order of the same size will be opened, of TP in cash and always closed below about 30 pips. But if I in the Hedge part had the possibility of having a SELL order that follows these rules: 1) If the Buy Martingale sequence continues, the Hedge sequence always closes orders at -30pips 2) The lots of the Hedge sequence increase by 0.01 (1st step 0.02-2 ° step 0.03-1 ° step 0.04 etc) 3) In case of tracing the Hedge sequence behaves exactly like the martingale sequence (for ex. order Hedge 0.04 tracing 30 pips, order new sequence Hedge 0.02 etc) with TP total (Martingale+Hedge) of € 5. 4) When the 5th step of the 1st space order is finished, the Hedge sequence resumes when the 2nd space order is activated What are the strengths: 1) Security: when the Martingale sequence goes strongly against trends, the Hedge sequence helps to reduce the margin required, mitigating the danger of the margin call 2) Greater profit: the Hedge sequence always closes at 30 pips, if in the 1st step I will have a TP of € 5, in the next the TP will be around € 7.50 and so on (increase in balance and relative equity) 3) Other? What are the weaknesses: 1) Market: if the cross is in a lateral phase for a long time = poor performance 2) Find some programmer who kindly make the necessary coding Does anyone have any observations to do with what I wrote? P.S. Merry Christmas

Dear Luca &amp; all i thank you for your contributions , and hope the best for all of you and great thanks to Joancb and Ebeckers i read the whole thread and will start to demo both versions 1.4 &amp; 1.132 for a month before i go live &amp; off course i will be following your life &amp; Demo accounts feedback thanks to all

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Good morning. I'm very interested in this post. Congratulations joancb, for creating a nice program. I ask if it is possible to change. I would like a simple, manual program. example before starting robot, I see a pair eur / usd start buying, put robot and open automatically buy, if eur / usd drops and resumes buy (every 300/400 pip) so on, when to go up and take profit and automatically close robots. can this be done? Next program - distant pip (each 300 or 400 pip opening depends on the pairs) - on and off martilanga - lots - profit (when it takes profit and stop robots) - just sell or buy with manual assembly this robot (one time profit and close everything) as I indicated above. since February 2018 I have only deposited 51 €, now almost 4000 € (over 8000%) as you see this picture. Thank you very much and best wishes happy new year 2018

--- 帖子 #756 ---
hadnt seen this post/s as i had unsubscribed to the thread by mistake. so i thought everybody was sleeping lol my tests as you can see are still ongoing and making money in real and demo, thats good

--- 帖子 #757 ---
good (or bad) to know , thanks I dont think ebeckers will fix this, maybe he s not interested in this thread anymore but i have to admit we have to thank him for everything he has done together with Joan. thanks to both im still using v1.4 on live account

--- 帖子 #758 ---
So far since my live test started months ago i took the decision of substituting a few pairs due to high swap fees and bad market behaviour for this strategy next pair i will substitute(when all actual trades are closed hopefully) and not use anymore is Aud/Usd. Huge swap fees and trends that are risky and last long lol, not worth it

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi Luca which pairs do you trade on now? I have also AUD USD fevers.... Big open trade 11 stes.. Patrick

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi, whats the version of EA that you use now? is 1.31 the best? thanks

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Eur usd eur gbp gbp usd aud nzd aud usd usd jpy

--- 帖子 #762 ---
This Ea with v1-4 default settings seems to like ranging pairs like for example eur/gbp that have a high value pip, so they reach profit in the trend direction after only 20-30 pips as opposed to aud pairs that have low value pips and take too long to reach tp, then creating a DD when the price goes in the opposite direction. worst pairs to trade this are in my opinion so far usd/cad usd/chf aud/usd aud cad is ok because it ranges well but profits are small these above are also pairs with very high negative swap fees, so they should be avoided.- swap fees when trade takes too long to close will eat all profits. very simple i ve observed this EA for quite sometimes now. it has been 6 month live trading and more on demo of course things could go wrong on other pairs too this is one of the simplest and best EA s i ve seen around

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi to all After making some tests, i found out that the last version 1.32 has no bugs. The bug exists if you put 0 on the profit. Lucas i think i will agree with you on aud/usd as it is trending since 12/12. I am on 6 step now 0.18 and does not want to turn down. What should we do? My dd is around 400-500€

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Hi Zakgr, im at 0.18 too on aud\usd. it s ok, its part of the game. problem is not the drawdown at -500, problem is how much you re trading with and your remaining margin in % . mine is at 816 % so its ok.. i have a DD of -834 euros (as i write )floating now but well ahead in balance(5556 euros) and profits so i let it run. my limit is 0.27 lot i may stop the EA on that particular pair even before it reaches that trade. i will let it run until it comes back and then eliminate aud \usd from the list and substitute it with another one. my profits since october 9 are 2409 euros and of those i withdrew to my bank 1853 euros. all is visible in myfxbook Good Luck! keep us updated, this thread shouldnt die, im convinced this EA has value aud\usd has a big resistance at 0.79 and is trying to break it with no success so far so it may turns back soon. if it breaks it then 0.806 is another huge resistance. but thats another 160-200 pips from now

--- 帖子 #765 ---
My margin is at 800% . All pairs are trending. It is a dificult situation. Lets see on Monday how things will go

--- 帖子 #766 ---
it definitely became a difficult situation for me too. drawdown is high now but i ve seen worse , my margin dropped significantly (350 %). it had happened the same thing (if not worse ) with my first live test in july 2017 but there i had made some mistakes that i havent done now. all pairs are now trending you re right. trump tweets dont help. maybe draghi will come to our rescue lol. in total this EA on the two tests (live) that i did in two different peiods has brought me good profits (3974 euros) but has its risks too. i got used to the drawdowns but the problem of course is if many pairs trend without retracement. yesterday profits were very good but the drawdown has reached medium high dangerous levels, its true. lets update

--- 帖子 #767 ---
confirm, I am at 613% of the margin, we hope for the recovery of the dollar. Luckily on Monday, I changed with 4 steep for 50 pips, 1 for 100 pips and another for the last 100 pips space I am convinced that what I posted here (#753) had a reason

--- 帖子 #768 ---
you and zakgr have a higher margin in % than me due to the number of pairs(but not only) you re using i guess(3 vs 6).. about the change of the steps is too late to do it now for me for the recovery. i may stop the EA if there is the risk of triggering too many 0.18 trades in several pairs and try to avoid the margin calls without acxtually closing the trades myself at a loss. about what you said in post 753 it could be good too , its an idea, grazie! lets hope for monday. we need the EA to close some counter trend trades before the feared margin call does it automatically (usually choosing the most negative trades). eur usd has had a huge spike aud usd reached a high key top price and overbought usd jpy is at a support level gbp usd is very high in price hopes are there but its also true that the trend may continue. we have to monitor

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I suggest, as the moments are very crusial, to write here any movements you do with the ea in order to have opinions and choices Lets descuss on Monday our future moves!! Goddnight to all

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I will , goodnight!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
aug only about 500pips up ,why you have so big lots?and have so much pairs. its dangers. my ways is change every spacePips just like space1Pips is 80-100pips ,space2Pips is 130-150 pips,....for 500pips is Normal band，so design when have 500pips ,bigest lots is about 0.08-0.12. goodluck for yours and sorry my english is badly

--- 帖子 #772 ---
yes 0.18 is big and it hasnt happened a lot so far and probably 0.12 should be the maximum,

--- 帖子 #773 ---
500pips 0.08-0.12must be design.500pips is Normal moves. every years 500pips moves would have about 10 times . and genera have once times about more than 1000pips moves. martingale ea must can be defy this situation。 then it can be use relax。 thanks

--- 帖子 #774 ---
big pip moves are of course common. problem is when there is no retracement. for these settings we need a retracement of only 50 pips for the first five steps but aud usd and usd cad have betrayed us more than a few times. what you say should be definitely considered of course.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
ok zakgr you had asked me to tell you what i was going to do. i observed the opening of the market and decided to change the settings of the EA on all pairs and making almost impossible to take a 0.18 trade ( 500 pips from the 0.12 one) and 2000 pips for the others to avoid disabling the EA &amp; hoping that other counter trades will be taken and the market will move a bit both sides so that margin would go up a bit. so this is not a permanent solution but just to reduce risks for now i noticed in these 6 months that 0.18 trades have been pretty rare. that means that there is usually a sort of retracement after max 250-300 pips but of course sometimes there isn't. it doesn't measn that this solution would suit you because your margin is higher and you have less pairs

--- 帖子 #776 ---
hi thanks for ea please share mq4

--- 帖子 #777 ---
My idea is in the 0-100 range，the market is mainly random volatility.， If there will be retracement，can be profitable without add lots， Martin added lots only to speed up the process，Increased profitability。but increases the risk if a trend is present。just like this time。 default setting，in my opinion，Profits are too high,maybe morethan 100%/year--It's too risky. I would like to see a system profit of around 20 per year or so，Can withstand fluctuations greater than 1000 points. Another idea ，frequently backtest ，Look at the curve ，if longtime Profits，just half year， then Improving risk preparedness， Increase space---before this time ，The market has a steady period of half a year,Under the default settings ，Most of the basic positions are in the range of 0.05-0.08. can make a profit and close your position. --So we need to improve risk preparedness recently----Balancing risks and benefits. thanks

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hi folks, Just found this forum. I've used martingale eas extensively in the past and really like the profits they can generate. You have to skim of course but if you get it right it can be a nice way to trade. I'll watch the forum with keen interest and play with the code that joancb was so kind as to share. Still haven't sorted out what the most recent stable version is but I'll get there. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi Everyone, Ive read the entire thread... I still don't understand why orders are placed or spaced the way they are. I don't understand the sequence of the amounts either. I have code that works well on the GBPJPY.... I believe its all about understanding the settings that go with the frequency of the currency. I have a number of forward tests going on at the present time. I want you to see how placed my orders... I want to learn more about how this EA works. Thanks Marty

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Good !!!!! . Can you share your set in GC. I want to backtest. thanks

--- 帖子 #781 ---
just scroll in the thread, you will find it

--- 帖子 #782 ---
So you changed the 6th step from 100pips to 200pips?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
no, so far i just made sure that no 0.18 trades will be taken so i left the first 5 trades at 50 pips each in distance and no trades after(well i put a 6th trade( 0.18) in settings 500 pips(5000 pipettes in settings) in distance from 0.12 almost impossible to be triggered ). unfortunately my margin is not healthy(311 %). this is just a temporary measure and maybe you dont need to do this. i hope that there will be a sort of retracement that will trigger some counter trades and margin will go up and probably more possibilities to cash in and not only with the trend following trades (you know the 0.02), when you see that you cash in profit the 0.02 lonely trades is not a good sign, it means that the trend is continuing strongly

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Hi, I've made a "little" modification to the EA and now it is reversed. cheers!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi Joan good to see you again here can i ask you what do you mean for "reversed" lol?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hi Luca, instead of opening new sells/buys when price goes up/down it will open sells/buys when the price goes down/up. cheers!

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I backtest and I have bad results. Sorry

--- 帖子 #788 ---
worse than with the regular version?

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Just ran a back test... could anyone explain to me why my settings did what they did. It seems the buys and sells are fighting each. In the end the series of orders loses money. In a range this will happen every time. Why not have them separate.... the series will work both ways.... if the settings fit the currency. I took a snipit of a trade... could anyone explain how it works.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
The results i posted were from my EA that I coded....I dont think my settings will work with this EA unless the code is tweaked

--- 帖子 #791 ---
space3orders should be 99 or higher.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I changed to 99... no difference

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Hi Joan Glad to hear from you again. Give us your lights here!!!

--- 帖子 #794 ---
0.18 are triggered . I have eurusd 0.18 usdchf 0.12 (changes the 6th step to 200pips to buy some time) euraud 0.12 and audusd 0.18 Margin call 500% How much space do i have? I dont know how to calculate I left the settings same except from last step to go to 500 pips (after 0.27) will be dead by then)

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Ok thanks, I think it was the version that was here

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Oops, wrong version. playing with settings Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) cheers!

--- 帖子 #797 ---
I dont understand why this order of trades closed out at a loss when there is no SL. I still think the hedging is fighting itself. This series first goes down 3, then up 2, then down 1, then up 4, then down 6 and closes at a loss of $27 and it was open for 18 hours. I think the hedging is holding up this EA.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
+27 doesn't seem a loss to me. the orders will close when the sum od buys+sells reach the input profit value. in the original version I still have orders opened since 2017 June. cheers.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Do you still trade with your first ea like me and lucas? If yes do you have myfxbook?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
You're correct.. I started at the wrong point.... I'm the idiot.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Here's a snip-it from my forward test today and the results.... i dont use hedging because i believe the orders end up fighting and trades take much longer. Im on the M1, GBPJPY, Leverage is 1:400.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Yes, it starts on 2017 April the 17th the two spikes (Oct. 1st and Nov. 15th) are caused by my broker messing with the History. https://www.myfxbook.com/members/cusber/fortfs/2158725 cheers!

--- 帖子 #803 ---
that's nice How do you choose to buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
1MA, 3MA with a pip difference between the two, 2 candles back.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
I tested on EURCHF but it stops with equal size like 0.18 buy and 0.18 sell. Why does it happen?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
you re still "ok" but it starts becoming risky. to know how much you have its easy. 1) TRY TO AVOID BIG TRADES BY DELAYING IN PIPS IN SETTINGS YOUR TRADES OR BY DISABLING THE EA 2) CALCULATE. EXAMPLE IF I HAVE EQUITY AT 3478 $ AND FREE MARGIN AT 1176$ I HAVE 295 % MARGIN . I STILL HAVE ANOTHER 2302 $ IN NEGATIVE TO GO TO MARGIN STOP OUT AND ACCOUNT WIPING.....(MARGIN IN % IS: EQUITY /FREE MARGIN * 100) MY BROKER LIQUIDATES TRADES WHEN MARGIN REACHES 100 % AND MARGIN CALL IS AT 125 %(JUST A RED WARNING)

--- 帖子 #807 ---
OK, thanks!

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Can somebody come and pull aud usd down by force? LOL it seems stuck at 0.796 ahah but IMO it should move soon and probably down

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Hello, Nice ! What VS of EA are you using here ?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
finally somebody decided to pull down the AUD a bit lol. also the dollar gained more strenght today. that's good for our opened trades, less DD, more margin, more peace of mind eheh. when the storm will pass I will have to re-assess the pairs to use. eur/gbp seems a nice one so far, ranging, big pip value, less DD. i will definitely ditch aud/ usd, don't use that pair, an advice. gbp usd is tricky for its price swings that can be risky at times for sure, will think if using it or not

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thats an EA I coded. Im going to give Joan some ideas ive learn over the years to help improve his EA.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi I thought I would skip testing. It would be a bad idea if I did skip. Really interesting how it keep some hedge and keep on doing martingale. here are my few comments Add Entry filter , I saw that the bot keep sending entry when there is no position. No sure what trigger but it seems like immediately. Adding filter reduce bad entries but you can add more pairs to trade later. Reduce martingale exponential number. Default martingale is 2. Which is double lot each time. Try not to increase lot size. Stay with initial lot. I knew it sound bad but look at my explorers. May be try 1.1 or 1.4 for head start. Make martingale filter and more selective . Not just making new position every 10 pips or so. Send order when the market is 'more likely' to help you. Do not give up.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Here's my trades from today from my forward test... this will be the last time i post results of mine... Im confusing people... i want to help Joan improve his EA My code needs 10,000 to work with. I use 1:400 leverage. If this were a live account I would be taking profits out and be playing with their money.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
thanks for your post. i noticed you used 1 lot trades, thats huge, of course it depends on balance but its too much and you use gbp\jpy, thats one of the fast trending pairs,,,,

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I agree with you. The object of this "game" is to have a grid as large as possible. I'm assuming you're using a 1.5x. That means your .27 order is the 8th trade in your series. Why not push the .27 out to the 15th or 16th order. I think I had a 31 level trade yesterday. I use a small grid space and also use a small TP which is only 14-15% of the grid. So retraces of that size come regularly. I've tried to get the starting balance under 10K... but my code needs the room to get going....and I like the faster currencies... plus my code goes with trend although its hard to tell at times, and it can blow the account... but thats the risk of using the martingale strategy. Some work better than others. I believe mine works well. I want to help Joan improve his...thats why we are all here. Thanks Marty

--- 帖子 #816 ---
i havent looked at all your statement so i dont know at what distance in pip you start. I start from 0.02 lot and my max lot is 0.18 . I use 6 currencies and in 6 months i usually have no issue and 0.18 trades are not common. But now for example all pairs are trending and i have been in a bit of trouble these days.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Check my statement, you can figure out the settings. I dont like the hedging side of the EA. If you get into a range, it goes back and forth. And like you said, now its trending and you used up your grid.... I'm guessing. Martingales suck...lol But we can make this work!

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hello to every one and thank you to have offered this opportunity to test this EA. I have only a little problem: how to adjust the brown window? I did try to change x and y display, for exaple 20 and 20, but...nothing! https://www.mql5.com/en/charts/81753...swissquote-ltd

USD initially recovered this morning but then at night got really badly hammered only to recover in great fashion after one hour. crazy market. aud/usd reached new highs and drawdown was simply huge. very scary. still EA resisted. a lot of forex accounts got wiped today, the moves on gbp usd and aud usd were simply huge. now my margin is again at 400 % much better than 300 % or 250 % (that i saw today) for those following my live test on myfxbook i want to tell you that i now united tests of july august with the one started in october. better like that to have more data. you will notice the curve of profit is a bit different at the start . this is because i was closing a lot of trades manually as i was scared about drawdowns. this EA to a better analysis should only probably used with so called "ranging" pairs. will see if i will reassess pairs in the coming future. so far i ditched already 2 and as i said aud usd will be the next, as soon as those ongoing trades close

Hi martypatty , Is this joan's ea or your personal development?

Hi furgz, It's mine....I'm sorry for the confusion. It won't let me go back and edit at this point. I'm talking with Joan and giving him ideas to improve his EA. Thats why we are all here in the first place ... to help each other succeed. Thanks Marty

Hi to all, We are in major problem. I have a dd of 2000euro. The account is 3800 The eur/usd is at 0.18, usd/chf at 0.12 (next step I made is at 200pips) and aud/usd at 0.18 (next step at 0.27 will be triggered at 0.80700) The margin % is 500% it is good by now but if the usd continues to be week I will have a problem I am thinking to deposit some more money Any thought?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I have loaded the EA on a cent account, I will post results soon.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hi zakgr, You should put some more money and change the EA inputs to make it low risk. You can try the below one, however problem with Martingale strategy is if market moves only in one direction for some time, it just blows the account 0.01, 0.02,0.03 each after 20 pips space 0.05 after 50 pips space 0.08 after 100 pips space 0.12 after 250 pips space Cheers!

Hi everyone, I have loaded this EA onto a real account trading 9 currency pairs they are: AUDJPY CADJPY EURGBP EURJPY EURUSD GBPAUD GBPUSD GBPJPY EURJPY This week it has traded making a net profit of $276 on an 0.02 lot size I have a question : Would it make sense to close all trades at the end of the week if this is the result ? or let it rock n roll.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
I don't think there's any need to close all the positions over the weekend.，unless you find make too rich this week,and happy do next week again

--- 帖子 #827 ---
You mean rock n crash?! No, but serious. What is your account size? How many trades did they take and what was the max DD? Just curious.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
My account was $731.00 beginning of the week Balance: $1158.08 AUD Equity: $1004.78 Margin: $702.06 Free margin: $302.72 Margin level: 143.12% Profit: -$153.30 Can't tell you how many trades were taken till Monday when the market reopens as the statistics are not showing on the charts.But looking at the results I think I will close all the trades and restart fresh on Monday. Would like to thank you for your comments "MAY THE FOREX BE WITH YOU"

Is that using the EA from this post? : https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post10673656

Hi johnsmith2nd, I use the settings posted by luca1073 at Post 749. Would like to take this opportunity of thanking luca1073 for these settings.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Close them and start only one pair. You have very low capital to have 9 pairs. You definetly blow the account sooner or later. This week was a ranging week. Thats why you make some money. Take my advice

--- 帖子 #832 ---
How are you doing with your account. I see you have dd of 4000. Any thoughts? I have disable the ea and i wait the 3 pairs to stop trending (audusd eurusd usdchf) if they stop I think the ending is near

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I swear if i ever get out if this situation i will never ever touch gbp usd again . It did 500-600 pips without even turning back 50 pips simply craZy and trump of course is not helping situation is now grim but we ahould have used only ranging pairs like eur gbp and aud nzd and others. Those have remained rangers even in this crazy bull market good luck

--- 帖子 #834 ---
I would suggest, to add in the EA the option to open trades following the trend in accord with the Ema as shown in this image of another EA.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I hope this thread is going on. This EA is very good. It does need to set in accord with the historical volatility of the pair and work time. One friend of mine use Adr to choice the best and quite currency. Today +132 gain and +2.9 floating on demo platform. Every day is going well. Pairs: E/U, E/G, E/CHF, A/U, U/J. Setup as default. I will add G/J with 20/50/100/200 pips of step. Thank you and regards.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
GBP/JPY? strongly but strongly advised not to use that pair....its suicidal.... in another post below i will give an update on my account situation and some measures i would like to take from next week....

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I thought i would give an update on my live account that has been suffering greatly these last 2 weeks. Drawdown has been huge and i felt it was worth to add more funds to save it. of course adding more funds also brings more risks. i also eliminated the pair aud /nzd temporarily not because it was not good but to increase my margin need and that pair had 4 trades open and with a floating loss of only - 4 $ so that helped me a bit to avoid margin call my margin is now at 399 %. i ve seen it going down to 190 % (100 % is the end ) from next week i will try to cancel out(close at loss) all faraway losers in pips on aud usd and gbp usd. i will use all the profits from the next week (and on) that the Ea will do to close even partial positions and reduce the risk on DD. this idea may help. what do you think? i still believe in this EA , i just think maybe pips in levels should be bigger (not sure) as another member here suggested and im trying that on demo now.(70 pips for the first 5 levels (instead of 50) and 6th level at 140 pips from last 5 th order. no more orders after... what i know for sure , try to avoid usd\chf, aud usd and usd\cad for the swap fees (and the resiliency of aud usd) and gbp \usd has swings in price that are too high, really risky and its very prone to flash crashes or incredible surges. even so until 2 weeks ago gbp usd was very profitable but when (and if) i manage to close all my trades i will not use this pair ever again for this system. im now testing on demo together on v13.1: eur/usd (the only major in the group , it goes high or low but not crazily like gbp usd) eur/gbp (the most profitable and good ranger so far) aud/cad (the most boring one) nzd/cad aud/nzd nzd/usd (not sure about this one)

--- 帖子 #838 ---
a nice read about drawdown issue, some solutions and how to look at it http://forexop.com/trading/drawdown-avoiding-mistakes/

--- 帖子 #839 ---
i will use 1,2,4,6,9,18,36....lots array The aim is to strengthen the previous profits and Solve the risk add up，Equilibrium interrupt risk，raise the end Martin coefficient and raise space pips by these to Significantly reduce risk

[quote = luca1073; 10714396] {quote} GBP / JPY? fortemente ma fortemente consigliato di non usare quella coppia .... è un suicidio .... in un altro post di seguito darò un aggiornamento sulla situazione del mio account e alcune misure che vorrei prendere dalla prossima settimana .... [/ quote ] Thank you for your advice. I did already think about this high volatility of this currency and for this reason to test this pair is the follow: is it better to choice a low volatility pair and let it work in quite hours of the market, with strict steps of trades, or a high volatility pair with strong returns of price movements, with wide and progressive steps of trades and very strict MM ? Sometime quite pairs may have suddenly movements without "comeback" and this, with tight steps and many trades may be dangerous because floating may increase very much. From July 2014 to February 2015 EurUsd did a downhill of almost 3500 pips. If we should have had this EA, what should have been the best setup to not go in margin call? I did read another suggestion but I don´t know how much it can be useful: to install the EA in pairs linked with correlations; for example eurusd, usdjpy and eurjpy and so over. Another suggestion is to work at the same time, manually or automatically, with a whatever strategy, in favor of the trend. So the trades may be always balanced.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
you re welcome, to answer your question IMO always better pairs with low volatility and lower returns for this strategy so avoid all trending pairs . Fear and greed are the enemies of forex and all of us are caught in the trap lol about the 3500 pips i know about it but the important here is the retracements not the change in pips. With no retracements 3500 pips is surely a killer unless you have a HUGE account about the correlation pairs i ve heard about it too and i tested an EA TRIO DANCER that was using these pairs and martingale very risky riskier than this Little martingale.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
sorry i had missed this post. What do you mean for lots array? 0.01 , 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.09 etc?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
yes.i.used 0.01，0.02，0.04, 0.06 ,0.09 , 0.18 , 0.36…lots array. it will be more lower risk than 0.02 0.03 0.05 0.08 0.12....lots array .

--- 帖子 #844 ---
For me 0.36 is anyway too much. 0.18 is really my maximum of course it also depends on the account size

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Usually not up to 0.36. and my account is less than you

Can someone add only buy or only sell option for this ea v 1.4?

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Try this when the market is opened

--- 帖子 #851 ---
in practice you would like to remove the main feature of the EA? the system does not have an entry based on filters to start the trade, you switch it on and he immediately enters a sell order and a buy, the one in the market direction profits immediately, the other accumulates as almost any martingale. and to think that I would like the Hedge part to be implemented (post # 753), to reduce the margin when the trades goes against the trend, obviously we do not have the same opinion.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
I re-read your #753 post and it could be interesting. im not a coder though but it would be nice to test it on demo for a month and see how it beahves on those terms

--- 帖子 #853 ---
an update :my DD on my live test has definitely reduced also due to my small interventions and some trades that i managed to close at a loss on aud/usd and more importantly on gbp usd. i say more importantly on gbp usd because the distance now from the last trade taken by the EA before i disabled is still very far while with aud/usd we are much closer and thus it is more hedged. the abyss is definitely far now but not that much and risks are still there with my account but significantly reduced. account is still there and so 90 % + of the profits but as i said DD is still high. gbp usd is really to be avoided

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Is your DD is above 90 % + Gain. What is the equity now.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
No i never said drawdown is 90% . I said my profits are still 90% there. My balance is now 8410 and my equity is 6058 . I had added funds on jan 26 to save the account and closed a few trades at loss during the ordeal. My profits are still 4000 euros (as of now) and my account is still there but i plan to eliminate gbp usd and aud usd once i close all the trades on those pairs. I will try in the future to use ONLY "realtively" ranging pairs

--- 帖子 #856 ---
What is total gain after adding the fund and current DD

--- 帖子 #857 ---
4010 euros all is visible (in my links in profile id-go to the first link-) in myfxbook of course if you calculate actual drawdown then my profits are less but drawdown( floating losses) varies every second

--- 帖子 #858 ---
also i plan to change the number of pips between orders(probably even 100 pips for the first 5 orders, then a 6th order at 200 pips and thats it!). so far in backtesting ( that i usually dont like) aud/cad , eur/gbp and nzd/cad perfomed really well with very decent drawdown for 13 months in backtesting with the above mentioned pip order ratio. im missing more data for other pairs but now i know famous pairs should be avoided for this strategy. the less political turmoil, the less fundamentals the better. pairs must almost be dormant (with low ATR) for this to work long term-

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I just found out the holy grail of this EA : Eur/Gbp..... i tested brexit with an account of only 1000 euros (starting june 22 2016 through a few days after that) and it doesn't blow....it blows with 1000 us $ though but with a bit more than 1000 $ it stays afloat i tested the flash crash of the gbp on october 7 , 2016 where most gbp pairs suffered extreme volatilty for an algo issue during the night (on some pairs it crashed 1700 pips) while on eur gbp the movement was limited to maybe 500 pips and the EA survived with a small account of 1000 euros. again these are extreme situations that happen rarely these tests were made with tick 1 minute data downloaded from the web plus un nom guai version v 13.1 spread used was 10 points (1 pip as my broker trades eur/gbp usually) very simple settings: first 5 orders at 100 pips between each other 6 th order at 200 pips starting lot 0.02 multiplier 1.5 profit 5 no more orders after that , 7 th order non existant, i put it in settings at 10.000 pips not to get triggered. profits seem good even with 100 pips orders, eur/gbp pips are more valuable and therefore reaches tp(basket profit 5) sooner on top of it. i had also tested yesterday the whole year of 2017 with an account of 2000$. it stays afloat , doesnt blow and makes good profit

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Well done Luca, keep up the good work ! and thanks for sharing, in your opinion what size account could you trade this with, for example - would a 500 euro account survive these settings on just this pair ? Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #861 ---
you're welcome! in my opinion to be on the safe side each pair should be traded with minimum 1000 euros /pair and sometimes even more. i think eur/gbp alone is ok/safe with 1000 euros, some pairs need more. probably the safest is 2000 euros /pair and avoid trending pairs like the plague lol. an account with 5000 initial deposit and 4 pairs could bring enough profits to start building up balance . i will test more pairs these days. i ve traded 6 pairs with 5000 euros and it went well for 6-7 months, 24 hs a day but my choice of pairs was a risky mix and it brought me "some"(big) trouble. the Ea has traded live on everything, interest rate decisions, trump tweeting, north korea crisis and more

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Thanks Luca i will test and let you know how i get on

--- 帖子 #863 ---
is this UnNomGuaiV1.131? or UnNomGuaiV1.13? there is confusion with versions of this EA

--- 帖子 #864 ---
HI Luca sorry to bother you again, but do my settings look correct ? i have tried to copy what you said, but unsure if it is right Thanks Luca.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
i never used v13.2 (the last) because i looked at the settings and didnt understand them at first. also the coder (ebeckers) didnt explain the differences between the two and because i was doing demo tests on v13.1 i went with that but im sure v.13.2 works fine

--- 帖子 #866 ---
you re welcome Montego. if you want the settings that im using now, copy them from these screenshots. where you see space 2 pips and space 3 pips settings you can put 10.000 and 20.000 (pips)(instead of 2000 and 5000) respectively so it will never get triggered. this screenshot is taken from a vps demo and forgot to change it but anyway even 2000 pips it hasnt triggered so far (lol) i use this on 1 min timeframe but it s ok any timeframe because i set open on new candle false. it workd only with pips

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Cheers Luca this i great

--- 帖子 #868 ---
I made test of v.13.2 in strategy tester with your settings on EG, M5 Also I made test on M1 TF, results are the same

--- 帖子 #869 ---
thanks for the test, only thing i can notice is that you put openonnewcandle to" true" while in my case open candle is set to false and that may definitely change the result (not so much after all in this case i guess). i think in my case it was slightly better. also in the test that i did i had put the space 2 pips and space 3 pips at 10.000 and 20.000 not to get triggered but i don't think the space 2 pips at 2000 that you have was triggered after all

--- 帖子 #870 ---
also the spread that you used for the test was current at 26(points), mine was 10(points), that also changes the result which is always positive, and thats great

--- 帖子 #871 ---
yep, results are a bit better this is default spread of my broker. I think, I have to change him thanks

I will share with you an amazing test i did on every tick with 2 full years + (Jan 2 2016 to Jan 17 2018) of 1 minute data on EUR/GBP . modelling quality says only 25 % but i found out all 1 min data tests return a 25 % modelling quality as you can see explained in this forum below (check post #5): https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/80927 you re very welcome to try my same test (or other settings) with your own data and share the results here if you wish. Thanks data source: http://www.histdata.com/download-fre...ute-bar-quotes i started with a mere 1000 euro the demo test and it survived brexit, the GBP flash crash of october 2016 and the american elections (well these affected less the GBP anyway) and all the ecb meetings and interest rate decisions and political turmoil. initial deposit 1000 euro , final balance after 2 years : 4431 Refer to my posts above for my settings and spread used will try to do/find data and do some other tests of similar time on other ranging pairs in the next days ps test says it was done until feb 2 2018 but i stopped it on jan 17 2018. it took so long that i got bored lol my mt4 is in italian, sorry, uplooaded at least the screenshot because most files are not supported here it seems

--- 帖子 #874 ---
good job, Luca I had got 25 % quality on M1 timeframe too and thought that test is bad. I tried EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURCHF and GBPJPG . All tests were good and i got good profit at the end. near 1000 - 2000 for one year

unfortunately the swiss national bank is not to be trusted lol. look at what happened jan 2015....ooppps 3500 pips down in one minute ....eur chf....but this is extreme and rare of course

--- 帖子 #878 ---
i just realized i did a mistake when i made my latest test on eur gbp. i put the first 5 orders as planned at a distance of 100 pips but the 6 th order(and supposed to be the last) was put by mistake at 200.000 pips where i meant it to be at 200 pips. so it never triggered. but it may not be a bad thing after all. now im testing with the 6th order at 200 pips and will report back. maybe 5 orders at 100 pips starting at 0.02 lot are more than enough, we 'll see

--- 帖子 #879 ---
following previous post: i tested: too much drawdown with the 6 th order at 0.18. i would keep it to 0.12 , 5 orders only ,starting lot 0.02, 100 pips distance , eur gbp and hope that the price goes back lol. see eur gbp is good because pip value is higher and closes basket earlier. of course it could play against us but from backtests it says its more in our favour

--- 帖子 #880 ---
EA works well with your settings from post #866 and 4000 depo but it earns money very slow. it is about 1000$ per year

I will never ever trade gbp usd with this system again lol.... Avoid all trending or better say "unpredictable high volatilty pairs". I ve been successful so far in limiting damages by putting to work two charts with eur gbp and im using those profits plus others from other pairs just to close old bad trades with gbp usd , aud usd and now even usd jpy who is in the hole. I was "only "-1800, -2000 € in DD and tonight (hopefully momentarily) it is at - 3000 ahah im laughing because a couple of weeks ago i reaxhed - 5200 in DD .i still have my 4000 euro profits intact and the account and I still think this EA is good. Just beware of the pairs

--- 帖子 #884 ---
1000 per year per pair i had calculated it worked even with initial 1000 on eur gbp or in 2015 it needed a bit more to survive. My results on test i think were a but better in profits though(around 1500 euro/pair/account)Anyway lets see where we get here eheh

I am doing opposite to martingale. Grid trading, semi automated i need Hugh trending pair i got stuck for last three days in GPUUSD for 40$ DD i only open position only when i reach profit. Yesterday it got closed. Since i ma testing it with ICmarket live with ECN account there was Hugh slippage of 2 to 3 pips some time in pending orders. I will update my study after one week how it goes. Till now i am 19$ profit using 500$ Deposit in one week. Current DD is 2$

--- 帖子 #886 ---
time ago i was trading with a similar system but probably it was not good after all. It would create a big gap between orders, margin was perfectly hedged but in the long run it was sure to lose. I dont know if your system is similar , probably no

just want to report that v13.1 too has bugs and should not really be trusted because it closed a trade at 0.03 at profit and let the other trade at 0.02 floating without closing the basket and without me noticing and forcing me to close it later the 0.02 at a "small" loss

--- 帖子 #894 ---
use version 13.2 is safe. I use it live since December 11th

--- 帖子 #895 ---
So what version was not having BUG. Also anyone know is there any EA to make any open position into martingale position with lock basket profit. I will open new position manual if it hit the TP no need open the martingale position if the position go on loss i need the EA to auto open martingale position with lock basket profit. EA Function needed. 1. open new position on loss pips value. (Distance) 2.Martingale factor (Multiple factor) 3. Trail the profit with lock pips basket profit for each pair buy separate and sell separate. (Close the trade)

joancb sir......Luca Sir,,,you did great job....awesome EA......Just one thing as per my understanding will make this robot best of the best..... Sir currently we are taking fix profit with one trade and multiple trades (for example profit is 5 then EA will take 5 with one trade and multiple trades).....i want you to add multiplier for profit too like multiplier added for lot size, when multiple trades opened by EA....Means with one trade it take 5 and with two trades it take 7.5 and with three trades in cycle it takes 12 and so on (if profit multiplier is set at 1.5)....it would depend on trader whether he want to use this as 1 or 1.5 or any other.....

don't want to put everybody off this system that i believed in in the first place but i have to say it is not worth it. i will just try to close all my positions at a "small" loss (not easy) or trying to use some profits to cancel out orders. usd jpy is in the pure hole for now its ok i will try to manage. Look at cryptos guys. i should have bought btc when it was at 200 $ in 2015. i bought another crypto back then that anyway revalued in the 1000's %% eheh bitcoin is probably the future and definitely the blockchain. we had (personally i did) enough of governments and its so nice to have no intermediaries like banks or govermnment entities for any transactions.it takes seconds to send payments now that there is the lightining network. soon you will scan QR codes at the supermarket. bitcoin will probably hit 1 million $ in the next few years and no im not joking lol. i just hope it plunges in the abyss now so i can buy more. bitcoin or the blockchain is unstoppable whatever the value will be. they cannot stop the internet. trump mumblings will be far away Good Luck to everybody ps by the way if you re new to bitcoin use this referral link of mine to sign up so you can get some free satoshi(cents of bitcoin) hourly https://freebitco.in/?r=1121883 . its a trusted site and im paid regularly if you want to create a wallet(bitcoin address and private key) go to www.walletgenerator.net . more info on bitcoin? www.bitcoin.org if you want a cheap good alternative coin "dogecoin" is a start for sure. research sorry for the off topic lol

Is there any risk calculation at all going on here? I don't see how you can realistically expect to win on some of these pairs long term. In order to use a successful martingale you need to be in a market with a definite bottom, or close to what is considered that and understand the total risk, and only use part of your account (or have more funds on standby to hold your positions).

--- 帖子 #904 ---
true about the pairs. Strategy worked for many months then it flipped out for many reasons. Many variables come into play but being a no stop loss EA it has its risks of course. Also on the way i ve realized the swap situation on some pairs even if the swap fees dont affect badly the outcome. EA was bringing every month 850-1000 euros then i had to disable it to avoid it from taking big lots (0.18 and beyonfd) with 50 pips distance it had made good profits but if i had left it runnibg as it is it would have blown already. 100 pips distance and eur gbp seemed to be a good candidate though

--- 帖子 #905 ---
The best pairs are going to be the ones that are more connected or stable so that the value doesn't stray far from the maximums and minimums something like EURNOR. You need to have a good idea you will be able to average out. Calculate the risk out and try it on ngas if you have access to a cfd, or even crude oil, index, stock on a buy. Tons of stuff where you can trade more like an actual professional (not retail) using a version of martingale but with proper money management - the profits are not amazing tho of course if you do it properly.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks, my guess is that EUR NOK must not have a good spread

After how many pips you will stop your EA when it go on loss is it above 200 pips. Why your not using swap free broker for this. I am looking for EA martingale position automatically after if it move 30 pips loss after i did manual trade for any pair i want do if you find any please let me know.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
for now i can tell you one thing i dont use swap free broker in this case because my broker is very good and honest so i dont feel like trusting other brokers right now and global prime(my broker) is not a swap feee but as i said it hasnt affected the EA profits that much at the end

joancb sir......Luca Sir,,,you did great job....awesome EA......Just one thing as per my understanding will make this robot best of the best..... Sir currently we are taking fix profit with one trade and multiple trades (for example profit is 5 then EA will take 5 with one trade and multiple trades).....i want you to add multiplier for profit too like multiplier added for lot size, when multiple trades opened by EA....Means with one trade it take 5 and with two trades it take 7.5 and with three trades in cycle it takes 12 and so on (if profit multiplier is set at 1.5)....it would depend on trader whether he want to use this as 1 or 1.5 or any other..... Sorry for bad English

thanks for "thanking" me even if i just tested this EA and reported back. Right now as i said in another post this strategy is dificult to trade it in real life. Its not worth it in my ipinion. Yes i took almost one year to understand but maybe i got to this conclusion. Right now i just hope i manage to close all my "lost trades"

Hello Gents, This is my first time to write here, I actually made an account on forex factory after in order to write this to you. For so long I always thought martingale would be so good on gold due to the fact that it's the most ranging market, much better than currency pairs. And also for long, i was after a fully adjustable MG EA and tried so many until I found this piece of art UnNomGuai. I am so encouraged with how I can adjust everything like the distance, the lot size for the re-buy/re-sell and the fact that it can close a group of SELL or group of BUY on net profit and not on TP pips. Thank you for this work Joan, it's really great. First thing I did, I backtested on 1 January 2018 to 27 April 2018 where ALL the EA's have failed miserably due to the few spikes that happened in gold in this period. UnNomGuai has managed to stay EXTREMELY safe (using my settings which I will show you) with a super low DD. All others EA's failed particularly on 25 Jan, 16 Feb and the super spike of 11 Apr with the bad news, due to the fact they use "lot multiplier" by default and I couldn't change that, which is the best thing I admire in Joan's EA because first thing I did is disable the multiplier and assign good spaces and pre-set lot sizes. This in my opinion can never fail in gold because unlike other currencies pair, gold is slowly trending (upwards of course) but very slowly, has the attention of the whole world so there are rejections at many price levels which makes it range, will never go IMMEDIATELY to like 1250$ or 1400$, it will have to be rejected many times before it crosses a new number. So, I am sharing with you attached the test result which yielded in 58% profit with only 18% max DD that happened at the spikes. Please see below the test conditions:- TEST 1: - time : 1 Jan to 27 Apr 2018 - initial deposit : 10,000$ - profit : 5798$ - Max DD : 18% that happened only at spikes (3 exactly), kept only for few days duration, other than that you will see in graph that 90% of the time DD = 0. - a DD of 18% is perfect fine for me, I would actually feel comfortable to double the lot sizing of all orders, with the same initial deposit, which would yield double profit and double DD, so that would be 120% profit in 4 months, trading only one asset with peace of mind. Settings : - multiplier = off - global profit or pair global profit = off - profit = 5$ - Sequence : this is a bit aggressive (a big bit), can be lowered down in real : * first space : 3 orders @ 0.01 lots space 20 cents (in gold cent = point) * second space : 3 orders @ 0.02 lots space 30 cents of price * third space : 3 orders @ 0.03 lots space 40 cents of price * last space : 99 orders @ 0.04 lots space 50 cents of price As you see, even with the space too tight (20 cents can happen within seconds in gold), yet the setup never exceeded a 18% DD during all the abnormalities due to the fact the multiplier is OFF. I am strongly against multiplying. TEST 2 : less agressive (you can see the settings in the image attached): - time : 1 Apr to 27 Apr 2018 - initial deposit : 10,000$ - profit : 1297$ (13% in one month) - Max DD : 7.68% - with this less aggressive spacings, I could comfortably increase lot size to maybe double or triple the tested lot size, Max DD is less than 30% which is perfectly acceptable. Please see the test results and please share with me your thoughts and comments: A- What do you guys think of what am doing? I am fairly new to forex (only 5 months), but I have many reasons to believe MG on gold is the most safe B- has anyone tried it on gold before? C- I am using version V1.12. Has anyone faced any problem with it? I havent downloaded the modified one which ebeckers made yet. D- I read most of the old posts and only one thing worried me, I usually like to reboot my EA on weekends, has anyone faced a problem with that? I saw some of you had a trouble when changing to a different VPS/platform that the EA didnt recognize the existing orders but I won't do that, the max i will do is just restart the MT4 occasionally during the week or on weekends. Will the EA perform normally after restarting? D- I am sorry Luca that you lost hope, but please don't, I was so happy of your way you write about how excited you were in the beginning, and let's work something out again together and test it. Regards, MK

Hi Mk trader, i was just going to write that i will close the test on myfxbook as i ve almost closed all my old bad trades and the vps is not reporting anymore because EA is disabled anyway so better just to close that myfxbook account that has ran for so long. so guys if you click on my account and see it s no longer there it hasnt blown lol. well at the moment there are trades opened for - 590 € and a balance of 7600 € . total profit at the moment is + 3200 € about your experiment on gold there was a user that said that he once used gold with martingale and it was a disaster but he wasn't referring to this EA, Thanks for your input! attached here is the screenshot of myfxbook account taken just before closing it

--- 帖子 #913 ---
very interesting. the only thing to do is opening a demo account in vps and try the settings provided by you for 1/2 months before to go live. i am running in real little ea but not this ea for eurusd 1m and for now i have good results.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Good evening friend, if you want to be sure you dont loose the settings of the ea its very simple: store the values of your setting in the inputs of the ea and recompile. For example i did the same with your test1. here is the ea: try on your vps. i am trying in mine.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Hello guys, Just wanted to update you on my above strategy of gold. Here is the profit made on the demo account with my above settings, from Monday 30 Apr to Thursday 3 May:- https://www.myfxbook.com/members/MKtrader1/mk11/2510569 3% gain, with 2.8% max DD, this DD happened of course on 1 May 2018 when gold dropped 16$ in a day without a slight retracement, however, the EA went out of it like a piece of cake due to the space settings and lot size I am using. If this was using a "LOT MULTIPLIER" at each space, you could have seen a 30% DD. I am so happy with the fact that I can disable the multiplier and assign specific lot sizes for each space/distance. The spacing/sizing used was: * first space : 3 orders @ 0.01 lots space 40 cents (in gold cent = point) * second space : 3 orders @ 0.02 lots space 60 cents of price * third space : 3 orders @ 0.03 lots space 120 cents of price * last space : 99 orders @ 0.04 lots space 150 cents of price I will continue to maneuver the settings as I see necessary by monitoring how the volatility plays with the EA. In my opinion, gold being volatile all the time, and most of the time non-ranging, is the best heaven for this EA. I am thinking of leaving the last space as a "reserve" incase of wide ranging, that could be a 99 orders @ 0.16 lots but spaced at like 1500 cents (15$ of gold price), incase it gets into a range without intra-retracement, this 4th space will catch it, but could take some more time to close.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Guys, would like to update, today was a heaven day for the EA, now Growth is 5% in exactly 5 days, Max DD is 2.8% happened only once on 3 may as you will see in myfxbook on 1 May (please press the DRAWDOWN on the top of the chart). Today even with the volatility, DD was well below the 1%. https://www.myfxbook.com/members/MKtrader1/mk11/2510569 I attach a picture also of how beautiful the EA is working. However, question to Lucas, as you know the EA closes at a "net profit" of the basket (either SELL basket or BUY basket), on the demo account, the closure of lets say 5 or 6 orders happens within 2-3 seconds. I am also testing the EA with less agressive settings on FBS cent REAL account, the closure is ridiculous, a basket of 6 orders closes in around 15 to 20 seconds total. In most of the times, this was favourable anyway because it was a spike, the first closure of the first order is actually the price the EA calculated the TARGET PROFIT at, so the delay of the closure of the other orders led to them having closed on better prices, which is good, but i start to worry if this happened on a certain price then the price retraced immediately from it, this delay could cause this basket closure to have a loss. Do you recommend any good broker with cent account and immediate execution?

--- 帖子 #917 ---
The EA is simply wonderful. I would appreciate the latest version and where to find it . Thank you.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
my broker charges a commission on top of the spread. I see that the cost of commission is not accounted in the profit calculator of the EA. anybody knows how this can be corrected? Also, are swaps accounted? very good EA btw

--- 帖子 #919 ---
i didn't understand your question , i'm sorry. trades will be closed when the basket profit has been reached.(5 seconds to close a trade? was it during a spike in price?) also i wasn't checking this thread anymore even if i think that eur gbp at 50 pips distance may still be worth trading(max 5 trades (0.12 lots) starting from 0.02 lots. with this strategy.it may not survive brexit types of market though (LOL). i will report back with more results.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
latest version is v.13.2, if i'm not wrong , you have to scroll a few pages back

--- 帖子 #921 ---
if you get charged a commission it may not be a bad thing: maybe your broker is ECN , like mine. so it will not trade against you.commissions on trades usually have no impact on profits. swap fees can ruin results a bit but it depends on the currency pairs that you use and your broker. some brokers have higher swap fees on some pairs. it depends. swap fees will affect profits only if trades are open for too long, otherwise it doesnt matter

--- 帖子 #922 ---
I did a backtest from June 26 , 2016 to May 1 2018 with Eur Gbp initial balance 1200 final balance : 3288 balance was way higher but strategy tester had to close a big chunks of trades artificially at the end of the test otherwise profits would have been + 1200 (4599 euros ) higher and the profit factor higher too settings are basic with no indicator intervention (CCI) ,multiplier 1.5, initial lot 0.02, maximum 5 trades (that mean 0.12 is the maximum lot size) prebrexit test blew(before june 24 2016) while with 100 pips distance and slightly less initial balance (1000 euro) didn't blow. i still think 100 pips distance is more boring and more prone to bring less profits and accumulate more swap fees but of course it depends. 50 pips distance between trades is very risky on many other pairs (gbp usd for example) less risky on eur usd. im personally going only with eur gbp. if you want to profit more , let's say you have a 7000 euro account. when you start your demo/live test, every day at different levels(to reduce risks) add a eur gbp chart and change the magic number for every chart in the EA settings. for this account size put maximum 5 charts backtest report is attached. it was done on 1 min chart thats why modelling quality is only at 25 % but it is ok. on 1 min chart it will say maximum 25%. there is an explanation online on why that happens -------------------------- one off topic note. im mining cryptocurrency from my browser by simply using google chrome (it works with firefox too.) i get paid in bitcoin, it is legit and they pay. you will make more money if you refer your own. use my link to install this extension if you wish. it doesn't slow your computer and contains no virus. you can also regulate the mining speed. already 1 million extensions were downloaded worldwide. potentials are there: https://getcryptotab.com/732945

here is my latest Live test started on May 22, 2018 with this EA (version v13.1) on Eur Gbp (5 charts). i changed the magic numbers of course. 578 euros profit to date. drawdown so far less than 3 % (maybe very lucky about that lol) explanation of the strategy is in the description of the system in myfxbook My myfxbook account is now completely verified otherwise with the new rules that they have in place they don't let you upload any results publicly. in case you want to check my stats or follow me there here is the link: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2545413 Ps forex factory doesnt let me upload setfiles, sorry

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Great to see the result Can i know what is grid space you have. How you manage if the DD goes above more than 300 pips Will you still open new position or you will open manual hedge order. What you Max LOT size for all open trades for one side

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Every trade is taken at a distance of 50 pips from each other Max lot will be 0.12 , no more. First trade is 0.02, 2 nd 0.03, 3 rd is 0.05 4 th is 0.08 and final is 0.12 Manual hedge order is what i have in mind for now but im not 100% sure about it.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
So if I calculate you will wait till 250 pips with max lot .12 and the total LOT of .30 . From your experience if it reach 250 pips DD you need to minimum of 100 pips retrace to close all trades in profit right. How many pair you trade for 5000 Euro. But having 50 pips grid size you need to wait long time when it stuck on DD this will kill monthly % increase. What you don that time you just simply watch the trade or you have another account to trade on other pair

--- 帖子 #927 ---
my account is 7000 and now i have 5 charts opened on eur gbp now So it is as if i had 5 pairs

--- 帖子 #928 ---
my account is 7000 and now i have 5 charts opened on eur gbp now So it is as if i had 5 pairs. I withdraw profits monthly. Everything in excess of 7000 is withdrawn

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Thank you for your replies and what is the difference between 3 level grid and 5 level.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
What is the MAX DD % for each pair and you will stop open position on other pairs when MAX DD reached.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
in one month of live test DD was very low , max 35 euros per eur gbp chart(-180 euros in total) but dont expect it to be so low. positions will be taken by EA until margin in % allows it. of course i may stop it during the way if i see that DD is in the thousands of euros. i ve seen big drawdowns with this EA on other pairs but statistically eur gbp resists more than other pairs but there is no guarantee

--- 帖子 #932 ---
So currently u r running only eurgbp for 7K account. Any other pair r you running which safe for martingale

--- 帖子 #933 ---
? so it means that you have beed using it for 2 years at least? in what timeframe it suits best?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
go see post #923

--- 帖子 #935 ---
when Joan talked about brexit, he meant on backtesting. he said it other times

--- 帖子 #936 ---
i'm using eur gbp only X 5 charts (identical pair started at different levels of price). I used other pairs for almost a year and it ended up in almost a "disaster" but i saved myself at the end lol. Gbp Usd can be very profitable with this but when it trends you're screwed big time. aud usd , usd chf and usd cad are not recommended due to high swap fees (well it depends on your broker too) From all the backtesting and forward testing that I did Eur Ebp seems the best pair for this EA/ strategy but i may be wrong. Eur Usd is also good though in my opinion (but with trump in office, his tweets and interest rates decision and political turmoils you could get in trouble pretty quickly. eur usd though doesnt have the swings in price that gbp jpy or gbp aud or even eur cad have . these last 3 are not recommended at all for this strategy

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Thanks for the input. You open position on the same side where the DD was happen or you open opposite side in another chart For eg If i have open position on EURUSD BUY and DD is 1000$. On the next chart you will open new position on BUY or Sell

--- 帖子 #938 ---
this EA (un nom guai) opens automatically a Buy and a sell at the same time. You didnt know? I think you are using a different syatem. This Ea wil always open two opposite positions about when to duplicate charts i will open the first chart with the EA at one level of price then the next day the second eur gbp chart at another level (and so on )Usually outside big news or market openings once i have at least 5 charts in a 7k account i will not add more or subtract(charts). i think i may add a 6 th chart but im not sure about it yet

--- 帖子 #939 ---
So Joan how long have you used this EA? how was your result? i find this EA is good to watch. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Hi, As this is a topic discussing about martingale, I just want to drop this here (something I've been working on for a few months). These backtests were run without optimization. It's a single EA with a fixed set of parameters that can run on any pair. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This EA uses a little martingale, hedge, averaging, trend tracking, etc, etc. It's a sum of hundreds of EAs I've made over the past few years. It's not ready yet, but pretty close. Making a martingale EA with controlled risk IS possible. While I can't share the EA itself (it uses external data, offline chart - custom renko, custom indicators, etc), I can share a few ideas and strategies to make your own EAs better. Best regards, Rafael

Its exactly one month today since i started my live account experiment with only eur gbp (X 5 charts) the result is : 690 euro profit. At the moment there is a - 70 Euro drawdown. maybe next week i will make another month experiment by adding a 6 th chart

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Please show how to change magic number, for use same pair multi times, same ea.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
I am really impress on your result. Still i don't understand the how manage the DD on first chart "it reach 250 pips DD". If the EA on second chart also go down for another "reach 250 pips DD" In chart one it will be 500 pips DD will more don't know what % of Equity

--- 帖子 #944 ---
in the settings for the first chart you leave magic buy 1 and magic sell at 2 2 nd chart) magic buy 3 magic sell 4 3 rd chart)magic buy 5 and magic sell 6 4th chart ) magic buy 7 and magic sell 8 5th chart )magic buy 9 and magic sell 10 6th chart) magic buy 11 and magic sell 12 and so on....

--- 帖子 #945 ---
im looking for a drawdown indicator that would calculate possible drawdown related to size of positions and equity in %. so far my experience on drawdowns has been more related to different pairs. for eur gbp i tried to put the chart at a day difference from each other to have a different price to reduce risk. but it has happened that during a big sudden drop or rise in price all trades were closed at the same time prompting the EA to take new identical trades at the same price. this is certainly more risky. i ve seen a 100 pip drawdown(not 100% sure) this last month and it wasnt a big deal even multiplied x 5 pairs . the lowest i ve seen was -180 euros(total). that is really nothing. the problem is that the more the price goes down( or up) the more it will take larger positions. for this reason the multiplier 1.5 is more balanced than a 2 multiplier for example. thats also the reason why 0.12 would be the max lot. but i have to admit that im looking for an answer to your question too

--- 帖子 #946 ---
The problem with backtest is the spread.The broker wides the spread up to 30 or 40 pips but on backtest we usually take a 2 pip spread. So backtest is very different from real life.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Inserted Code but it has happened that during a big sudden drop or rise in price all trades were closed at the same time prompting the EA to take new identical trades at the same price. How you manage identical trades happen when it close @ one time, will you close all trade manually and stop the EA on other charts if it night time all of them will running Running for one month could not come to conclusion. I used to do martingale on 28 pairs using trend detector and doubled the account with 30 days. But one mega trend will wipe the whole account.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
of course one month doesn't come to any conclusion. imagine if i ever stated that.... every system is risky and this is no exception

--- 帖子 #949 ---
Hi Rafael... Could you give a little more info on your backtest like, how many days, weeks months? Settings, what was your multiplier, order distance, TP? Thanks Marty

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Small query on every chart you start with same .02 Lot or different lot size Like Chart 1 - .02 Chart 2 -.03 Chart 3 -.05

--- 帖子 #951 ---
same settings for every chart, same pair, different magic number. the starting lot is always a 0.02 buy and 0.02 sell thats automatic . it is the EA that will take these trades did you ever use this EA on demo? you would have noticed that this EA works like this

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hi Marty, - Backtest were run from 2012 to 2017 on most pairs (some of them I only had data from 2015 to 2017). 100% quality using every tick. - As multiplier I use Fibonacci sequence! I tested 1.5x, 2x, 3x, etc. Once I tested Fibonacci (2x, 3x, 5x, 8x, etc) I had better results! But I am still making further tests. - Order distance it is not fixed! I use a % of DD. Once a trade reaches a certain %DD, it opens a new trade. I also have filters to avoid opening new positions on the same levels of previous positions - this is done to prevent opening too many trades on a ranging market. - TP is not fixed. I use the maximum profit reached -25%. For example, if profit reaches USD100 profit and falls back to USD75, it closes the trades. But depending on the number of trades that has already being opened, it closes at 0 for safety reasons. If you have any other question, let me know.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Hi Rg2 I have question on "Once a trade reaches a certain %DD" is this option is available opposite trade For eg if the BUY trade goes for 30% DD and it need to open SELL trade with % of the total LOT to hedge Is your EA has the option to open aniti martingale

--- 帖子 #954 ---
It works like this: Once a trade reaches the specified DD, it is ready to open a new trade (that is, a new trade using martingale - a new trade with a bigger lot). Let's suppose my first trade is a BUY. This BUY trade fails and reaches the %DD. Then, instead of blindly opening a hedge trade (SELL), like most EAs do, my EA will analyse the current market condition. It has 3 options: 1. If market is trending, it will open a hedge trade, SELL 2. If market is ranging, it will try to use averaging and open another BUY 3. If my EA can't decide what to do, it will do nothing and wait for a better opportunity From my observartions and from previous EAs I have made, I noticed that averaging is better at ranging markets and hedge is better at trending markets. In my opinion that is one of the secrets to use martingale in a more secure way.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
How you manage to analyze the trend using any indicator or price action. Will the hedge order will use different magic number, is there any trailing stop and auto open hedge option if it hit the stop loss till the trend stop.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Analyzing the trend can be done in any way. Either using indicators (there are thousands that can do this) or price action (for example higher lows, lower highs). Magic number must always be the same. Trailing stop could work, but that depends on the situation. I do use a kind of trailing stop, but it is not a fixed number of pips. As I said earlier, I trail the profit. About Stop Loss: In my opinion that is VERY important. It doesn't matter how secure your EA is, a SL should always be set. I am still trying to find the best value for this. PS - I am not here to tell exactly how to program a profitable EA, I am only sharing some things I learned from making EAs, specially using martingale.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hi luca1073, I have doubt once all five account reach the level of .12 LOT. And the hedge trade on all chart will be on .02 LOT how you manage the DD with your margin r we wasting time and money on this testing. I have doubt, from my experience to make the market move reverse we have to push the market with double the loss lot hedge trade. Once all the bad trade got closed we end up in margin call. If you have very good margin like more then 200k then we can play Or Once all the

--- 帖子 #958 ---
you do good to doubt this system. to be sincere you should doubt all systems. i still think that eur gbp is the only pair(if any) worth trading this strategy with because of its relative ranging behaviour. concerning margin im still looking for a position/margin in % , lot calculator for drawdown. does any people in this forum have one? the other day the EA took n. 4 0.08 trades and of course there were also 5 trades at 0.05 and 5 trades at 0.03 and 5 trades at 0.02 plus all the 5 opposite trades (buy at 0.02). total margin in % was 920 %...so not so bad after all.....drawdown was - 445 euros. account is 7000 euros. now drawdown is only -.80 because price retraced and made profit. exactly 823 euros since may 22 . 2018 of course with 200 k you could even trade the crazy trio dancer EA. i dont know if you ever saw it. once on demo i turned 3000 into 21000 on 3 pairs in 3 months but then lost it all lol but with 200 k it would have resisted making huge profits per month

--- 帖子 #959 ---
If you r using 6 six chart and 1000 pips below and 1000 pips above how much lot it will open how much margin is required rough calculation. If the We have the chart opened for every 50 pips move ~FUND required is 24K for six chart and the floating DD will be 11.5K

--- 帖子 #960 ---
im using 5 charts. the pips there put in the bracket is the distance from the last trade 0.12? im having a look at it thanks so far in the live test i had as i said 4 charts opening 0.08 trades each plus all the trades and total drawdown for 5 charts including swap and fees was -445 euros. i think price distanced about 20-30 pips from 0.08 in the red before turning back

--- 帖子 #961 ---
comeback2000 i also noticed a mistake in your excel calculator. you didnt put the 0.03 trades

--- 帖子 #962 ---
@comeback2000 not being too familiar with excel i tried to do a manual calculation of a possible drawdown assuming we are using 5 charts at a trading identical price level (unlikely) of eur gbp assuming im using a 1:100 leverage (my case). note that eur gbp value in pip is anyway higher than other pairs. this can play in our favour or against us lets assume a move of 500 pips without retracement: one chart will have : at lots 0.02 : 500 pips X 0.23(pip value) euros in value = 115 euros drawdown at lot 0.03 : 450 pips X 0.34 (") " = 153 " at lot 0.05 : 400 pips X 0.57 " " = 228 " at lot 0.08 : 350 pips X 0.91 " " = 318 " at lot 0.12 : 300 pips X 1.36 " " = 408 " ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL : 1222 euros X 5 identical price level charts (unlikely) : 6110 euros not that there could be some mistake in this , also i should calculate margin required for this also taking into consideration that the opposite trades of 0.02 reduce margin requirement a bit.

Out 6K DD from .02 we will make only 390 euros. And if you reach this position after 6 month and you make monthly gain of 500 euro and after 6 month you will be 500*6= 3000 Profit and DD of 6110 and Relative DD of 3110 So it will take minimum of 16 month to make 100% gain after that also we are in monthly profit. All this happen if market range on 500 pips If the market spike above this range then whole account will blow and again we need to start from starch

--- 帖子 #964 ---
i didnt get the 390 euro thing completely but of course if there s a drawdown and price is not retracing we have a stall in profit and a potential big risk of blowing the account.

here is a recent strategy tester report with dates picked completely randomly a starting capital of 1200 euros. period tested is 6 months. at the end there was a -200 drawdown and tester closed the bad trades otherwise profit would have been 200 more period tested is Nov 1 2017- Apr 30 , 2018 Eur Gbp 1 min tf my settings, max orders 5 starting from 0.02 50 pips distance between orders in this case drawdown was not big at all, so in these 6 months picked randomly, this strategy was a winner

I have one more method to try Sell .02 Grid of 15 pips each up to 600 pips. Each trade will have separate TP and trailing stop If the BUY trend continuous. For every 15 pips i will add .02 lot ie .02,.04,.06 till 600 pips UP. So i will always be in edged state. for this i need have ~3K has balance with hedging

is this automated with an EA or you re doing it manually?

You mentioned earlier that for you EURGBP works best with our beloved EA. I did so in the same way and the results are stunning. For my little real accounts only one chart EURGBP is working :-) On another demo account with 100.000$ (now with 600 trades) i found also some other pairs which perhaps could be very profitable. Please Luca, tell a bit more about your "statistical" results on the behavior of this EA. That would be very interesting! Thanks a lot, Pit arrr, can't make screenshots from remote vps still Pairs, sorted by profit (~ 700$) GBPJPY - 90 GBPUSD - 88 EURJPY - 86 EURUSD - 73 EURAUD- 60 GBPCHF - 46 EURGBP - 45 (!!) AUDJPY - 38 USDCAD - 34 USDCHF - 31 AUDUSD - 20 NZDUSD - 20 USDJPY - 16 EURCHF - 15 The maximal drawdawn was $538. Recovery Factor 0.47 Profit Factor 1.71 So, depending on the margineaters, which pairs should we use?

Did you find one? Later, Pit

Hi Pit-Lip, having looked at my several tests(demo or real(over a year), forward or backetests) i found out that big trendy pairs such as Gbp Jpy( for example) should be avoided unless you have 200 k or even 1 million lol. i found out that usd cad and usd chf are really bad (at least with my broker) because swap fees are very high and this eats most of the profits. aud usd ? i dont like it. somethimes the price trends and stays stuck for months creating a stall in profit and a relatively high drawdown. gbp usd is a very profitable one but you can blow your account in a big move (i almost did) if you don't add capital. eur usd and eur gbp seem the best for this and eur gbp is really the best. aud cad seems pretty safe but not very profitable for the pip value and other reasons. eur gbp has a high pip value so it reaches basket profit faster and tends to range. i didnt find the drawdown indicator yet but there are many ways to check (even manually but it takes time). hope that helps. if you have a real account with a lot of money(100 k?200k or more) in it then use the major pairs and add eur gbp and im sure you will be fine

--- 帖子 #973 ---
just to add one more thing . Since may 22 (start of live test with eur gbp) i checked the first trade taken by the EA and the opposite one (taken the most distant one in pips from the first one) and i found out that eur gbp ranged for exactly 200 pips from 0.87 approx to 0.89. These 200 pips created no issue at all and now i have only -70 in drawdown after all the closing and opening of tades and a total profit of 850 euros + but the reason why it didnt create an issue is because there were constant retracements which is ideal with this EA but this is of course unpredictable as with any system

--- 帖子 #974 ---
from about 3 weeks i am real with 3 charts and all 3 are in profit and all3 little drawdown. for the moment this ea is going fine with eur gbp. i hope for years.......

--- 帖子 #975 ---
great we all balance the price, if we all open in different price range.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
The problem is "hope". You should have a backup plan! For example: If price reaches a certain DD%, you could turn off the EA and open aditional trades so BUY lots = SELL lots. Then wait for price to go back to where it "should" be and close those aditional lots. Pros: Your DD% will "freeze" at the value you choose Cons: You will be paying swap and price could take a looong time to turn back, but at least you don't run the risk of having a huge DD without return. You could eventually accept the loss and close all trades.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
i agree about the back up plan for sure as im still thinking about one. I ve come across difficult moments with this EA on other pairs and it was not easy i ve never hedged but im thinking about this possobility for sure. Lets say we have a lot of sells and we are in the big red in DD, would you open a buy position for the same same amount of lots (or more) just to then "hope" in closing at breakeven all the other trades?

--- 帖子 #978 ---
If you have a lot of sells and price starts to trend up, your DD will increase, right? What you would do is define "20% DD is the maximum I will accept" If it reaches 20% DD, open some buy trades so SELL = BUY and your DD% you stop increasing. After price stops trending and reverses, it will eventually return to previous level (where you opened the hedge). At this level, get rid of the BUYs around break even and your SELLs, that were your inital plan, could give you the profit you were expecting. The problem is that during this time you will be paying swap, and if price does not reverse, you will be locked with the 20% DD. But it's better than risking having a bigger DD or even blowing up the account.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
now instead of having 20% DD i have a very low - 23 euros drawdown that is so low And probably the lowest since i started the test but we should always be careful and monitor and decide promptly on what to do

Please share input settings screen shot once

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I will later but i ve uploaded(also by screenshot) my settings many times in the past

--- 帖子 #590 ---
@ Ramana these are my settings, see screesnhots , in case you want to trade my strategy and put more eur gbp charts don't forget to change the magic number in the inputs when it says "magic buy" and "magic sell" for the first chart i use 1 and 2 (default), for the second chart 3 and 4 and so on.....i use 1 minute chart and open on new candle to false but if you want to use the feature "open on new candle" to "true" i advice you to use maybe 15 minute timeframe. this feature only saves you from big sudden movements (market crashes or major news (such as interest rate decisions or trump tweets lol) in my opinion but not much else. it may also screw up the grid a little bit(because orders will not be at exactly 50 pips) but it might be safer. screesnhot 1 is for settings, screenshot 2 is the rest of the settings because they didn't fit in 1 file but aside from the magic number in screenshot 2 everything has been left as "default" i use version v13.1 myfxbook link: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/luc...975888/2545413

Thank you luca

Hello colleagues. Can someone add UnNomGuaiV1.132 output time after the first login in minutes. For example, it enters a given time at 15.30 with one buy and 1 sell and no operation is taken within 30 minutes, then the output is triggered and the two operations are closed. Thanks in advance, then if I get I will explain my idea. Nice day

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Currently you end on opening all 5 chart on same range now it need close and wait for some DD and open another BUY/SELL

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Luca, as i am trading your strategy, may i ask, why you are using 1:100. Did you find out, that -according to your equity of ~ 7k$ - expected profit / risk / margin-eating is managed best? Did you try other leverages? Please tell us about your findings. Thanks a lot! Pit

--- 帖子 #595 ---
No, that was the leverage i started trading with my broker even before this system, never asked for more (or less) leverage.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
yes at the moment they are all on the same price(4 out of 5 charts). it happened in the past too, i dont know if it happened because it closed all previous trades in a sudden drop in price. when i had started my test in may they were all at different levels.....imagine when i started i waited one whole day to drop a fresh new chart at a fair distance

--- 帖子 #597 ---
what is your leverage Pit-Lip?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
actually 1:500 my calculation is for 1:500 04,70 USD for the first position 0.02 04,70 USD against it 07,05 for the "solving" position 0.03 16,45 $ as margin results risk / margin goes to 1:100 = 82,21 $ 1:200 = 41,10 $ 1:500 = 16,45 $ 1:1000 = 8,22 $ Sometimes a steady account, started with 30$ and leverage 1:500 goes further into save areas (in my opinion ~ 300$), sometime not. Several times the accounts get margin calls - we all know why this must happen. But, we have to prevent it... and we have to find tools for mititation. Sure, the 5 distances with greatest trade from 0.12 lot give some hope to overcome those situations. Luca, you once mentioned, that an account without manual closing action from user makes more profit. Therefore i am too very interested in drawdown or equity indicator to show such behavior of an account. Well, it is against the cool emotionfree trading rules, but sometime we all have a sixth sence for this, don't we? (When i look next morning to my vps to an blown account i repent not to have shut down the positions which i found in the evening before to be dangereous. Perhaps you know that. For those situation we have rules for number of trades per day, profit per day, profit per pair and so on. Indicator for balance/equity development would be great.) Pit

when i was talking about not manually intervening and its benefits it was almost at the start of this thread, that was. when i noticed about "the" many mistakes a manual intervention could create (it happened to me to be too "scared" at the start and wanting to close trades in advance or making gross mistakes by clicking wrong x buttons) making me regret to act manually . Some other times a manual intervention actually saved the whole account as so far (touch wood or iron) i havent blown up any account (yet and hopefully never lol) thanks for the stats relating to leverage

These nice moderately volatile swings in price in eur gbp are bringing some nice profits these days : yesterday only the system cashed in 80 euros. As usual moderation(volatility in this case) is the key. Because if the price kept a range of only less than 50 pips it would be boring and almost no profits would be made. But a swing of 100 pips with a retracement later brings much better profits and it is not boring . Well as long as the swing stops there , retraces and refuels again. This is why i think eur gbp works better with this EA but again these days are ideal it is not an indication of how this will work in the future. We have to build an exit plan for the "rainy days" if there will be
