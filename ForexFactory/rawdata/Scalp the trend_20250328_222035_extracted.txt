Hi community, inspired from this 3 threads: ( THANK YOU GUYS !) http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=276813 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=315572 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=325018 I combined a few of the ideas. Someone asked me to share it, so here it is. I will not answer any questions that have already been answered ! I think the rules are very simple!!! INDICATORS 1) Semafor (repaints) 2) LWMA 25 3) CCI 15 4) SnakeForce 5) Cycle Identifer (repaints) Rules LONG : - Semafor On BOTTOM (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close ABOVE LWMA 25 - CCI 15 GREEN (&gt;= 0) - SnakeForce GREEN - Cycle Spike On BOTTOM Rules SHORT : - Semafor On TOP (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close BELOW LWMA 25 - CCI 15 RED (&lt;= 0) - SnakeForce RED - Cycle Spike On TOP other description here Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London TF = M5 (M15) TP = +10pips (+8pips) &lt;- it is all up to you! SL = -20pips &lt;- it is all up to you! BE = +8pips (if you like...) Risk = 2-5% Only trade the first combination after Semafor! The repainting isn't an issue, because it is based on price action, but you know all that This is only another combination of indicators, nothing new. At the end you get the same/similar results as the other strategies. I hope it's understandable. English is not my native language. Cheers dynel14 UPDATE 27.11.2011: New template and rules here Update 26.12.2011: New template below Update 03.01.2012: -Snake now with alert (thanks @eric!) -New template

looking good Dynel, green pips Udine

CCI 15 SnakeForce have to match rite? in this image some times it doesnt eg trade 5 and 7 snake doesn't repaint http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...6&amp;d=1321630109

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Right, wrong picture. thank you. Update post 1.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hi dynel14, Systematic and uncluttered presentation! Keep it up. May Pips be with all of us. Roy

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Signals: 3 Wins: 3 Loss: 0 = +30 pips

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks Dynel. Looks very simple, but effective.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I want to add something... All 3 trades were counter trends, so the risk was higher! If you have basics knowledge about price action you also took the signals without considering the semafor, because the trend was clearly up! you see that this system give you a lot more great signals! So with all signals you had: signals: 6 wins: 6 loss: 0 = +60 pips nice weekend all

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yes, I looked back for a month or so of London trading, also a bit of New York as well and its surprising how well it works. I kept trying to think of something to make it even more accurate, but honestly, it doesn't need anything. Great system, thanks again for posting.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Yes, it seems a nice system. I'm going to test it next week. Just one question: Does the snake borders repaints? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Ha, that could explain why it works so well in hindsight.... I seem to remember using it briefly on another system and I don't think it does though.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
So this version does not repaint!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
will give it a try next week. how did you arrive at 10pips TP? was this due to back testing or just what you decided was your comfort level?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
is this still double the stop loss to the take profit, i noticed in the scripts its invictus, so i take it its only a 0.5 reward factor ? hope for some confirmation Dean EDIT: sorry its in first post, hold my hands up to that one sorry Dynel in that case i wish people luck but already seen too many get burnt with a very bad reward factor Good luck Dean

--- 帖子 #15 ---
IMO, that was caused by the system, not just the r/r.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks dynel14, We'll try for scalp next week It looks simple and clear, and we know that simple is the best..

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Agreed. Somethings are getting too complicated around here...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
If you are not comfortable with the R:R or TP/SL customize it for you. Only one example: Change the CCI period to 45/50. So you exclude the counter trade and can use R:R 1:1 (see picture below) The system can help you to see a good trade signal, but you must make your own decision what you will do with YOUR money. The system can't tell you that. Analyze the whole system, every each indicator. Learn how they work, use your brain! Read the threads mentioned on post 1! Green week for you all! Regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Dear friend, there is an EA called Visual Order Editor in your scalp the trend.rar file.. I check the lang and try to understand the logic of advisor, but I couldn't find.. I applied it into my real account and it sets 20 pip stop loss for me ? How must we use it? Thanks, gokalp

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I just downloaded the file and loaded up the chart in my MT4 platform and everything worked fine except for the SnakeForce will not load on the chart when I apply the template that was provided. Even when I try to manually place the SnakeForce on the chart, the indicator will not even attach to the chart. For some reason that is the only indicator that will not work. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
@StayFocused; You may open the editor and try to compile the indicator over there. If it does not work again; open a brand new custom indicator window in editor, then copy all of Snake Indicator into your new custom indicator, then try to compile it. This is not so complicated and may work

--- 帖子 #22 ---
You don't have to use it... but that is the default. 20 pip stop loss, 10 pip PT, 8pips profit goes to BE. You can edit those however, by right clicking on the chart, go to Expert Advisors, click Properties.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks friend, But I didnt understand 8 profit goes to BE ? It takes SL level to my cost (buy / sell level) ?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes, when you are 8 pips in profit on your trade, it should move the stop to break even, the price at which you entered the trade.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
+10 pips

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Well done!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
i sent you FB posts:-) is there a PDF for your system. It looks very promising to help with S&amp;R take profits levels...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I've seen it. Just copy all the information you can find here and create your own PDF. green pips...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
on aussie !

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Thanks. I deleted everything and then loaded the indicators up again and it worked. Thanks for the tip though. I will remember that for future situations.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I've read your system for a few days, and i'm downloading today. I wanna ask you, does this system works on all currency pairs? And does it works on 15min timeframe? Regards, OneLegend

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi, Where Is Semafor Indicator ?! Regards

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Look at the arrow. ps: first +10pips (and more...)

--- 帖子 #34 ---
dynel14, can you answer to my post? Regards

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hi Again, Thanks For Your Answer ... Why You Not Enter Here ... http://up.fxaria.com/images/hp5t2vtlul1tc34ku14.gif Regards

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi OneLegend sure. With this system I trade EUR/USD on M5 . I know that one member also trade AUD/USD with this strategy. Seems to be working. But demo it and you will know it Regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Because I've been sleeping On post 1 I wrote that I trade Frankfurt and London, so start is 7h GMT. If you took this trade well done! dynel14

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Where can i find the LWMA? cheers

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Dynel First trade -20,i must be a jinx lol

--- 帖子 #40 ---
LWMA = Linear Weighted Moving Average

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Show me your trade.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi Dynel I dont know how to do it but it was short on EU at 1.35169 and stopped out at 1.35369 looks like i was stop hunted cos it went straight back down to nearly BE,Did you not take the trade Dynel have i gone wrong ?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi, First Trade ... First SL http://up.fxaria.com/images/6dcjl0nggiv0c9lrass.gif

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Ah ok I see. No I dind't take it. Look at the picture why. On post 1 are rules, BUT price action comes FIRST . You had the possibility to go out @ BE (on my chart)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Because of support area or cycle spike ?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Support area. Risk was much higher. So if you are unsure don't trade.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Unfortunately Not Reach To 8 pips For Be ... Can You Please Upload Your Indicator That Show R And S Area ?! Regards

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Price came back to entry, so you were @BE. No indicator. Make your own lines/areas. dynel14

--- 帖子 #49 ---
On post 18 I have shown how to trade with the trend. +20pips (or more...) Try this at first.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Dynel Short trade EU 1.35438 correct?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Now closed BE

--- 帖子 #52 ---
On my chart was the 2nd red candle @35497 and reached +10pips

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Dynel are you using template from 1st post?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
@ dynel14; I see a economic calendar in your chart, could you share with us ? Thanks indeed,

--- 帖子 #55 ---
of course. here the chart

--- 帖子 #56 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks Dynel14

Ice cool system thanks dude. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
+10 for you well done

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I have noticed there are some more trades to made with this when price retraces to the MA against the general trend. this sets up to buy on a pull back or sell on a bounce against the line. also noticed there are retrace pips to be made when price is too far away from the MA. This is risky though if the market is running hard. don't want to encourage over trading , but thought id point these out ! Great system and setup!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
This is the way to be successful. Analyze the strategy/system and make your conclusion! Thank you for your contribution!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
no thank you for posting this great setup. i have been having a blast trading this along with other setups inside this strategy today . A demo of course! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #63 ---
nice, well done

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hey everyone, Thanks for the posts here. Dynel, thanks for starting the thread and taking the best of different systems and making something very simple and workable. I've spent some time looking back over some charts and I like what I see. I think I feel a little extra spring in my step for the holidays because of finding this methodology. I am also attaching my chart from today for review here. Let me know if I'm missing something. I have marked the signals with vertical lines, green for longs and red for shorts. One thing that I found from looking back is that there are many better entries right after the signal. I am using pullbacks for entry. On a big entry candle I would enter on retrace to about 50% of entry candle. In the case where the trigger candle is somewhat near the LWMA I am entering on retest of LWMA. These parameters for entry enable me to have more manageable stops. The downside is that there are some entries that I will miss, but it seems they are few. The chart is marked as follows: Trigger candle has vertical line. Actual entry is marked with arrow. My ten pip first targets were marked with little white lines. I also marked where the semafor was for one trade. Thanks again for everything. As I am typing this my last trade of the day is just about 10 pips away from my final target. PJ

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Wins: 4 Loss: 2 What was the problem?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nice trading Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
You took counter trades. If you have experience with it ok otherwise trade only with the trend and here the trend was down! all short signals yesterday gave you +10pips. I will update the template to prevent user take counter trades.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
psperos, very impresive results. Can you share with us your "other setups", please?

wow imagine that in your pocket each day im an honest guy, so ill be honest some kick ass trading right there, well done. I have admiration for those that print screenshots of everything with times and losers my credibility gos to you.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
My first post here and I must say this is nice, clean and simple system. My first two trades today and both of them were winners. It's a ranging day so both buy and sell trades will do just fine today in my humble opinion. Thanks for Your effort in bringing this magnificent system to all of us. All credits go to You Dynel. Cheers

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Nice that you guys have made some pips with this strategy

--- 帖子 #74 ---
which indicator gives the main confirmation?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I took the third one, of course with success again. 30 pips for today - not bad at all. Cheers

--- 帖子 #76 ---
the combination of all is the main confirmation

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi, Can you comment the attach entry? I think all conditions were in place, was there anything wrong? Thank you

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This is how I saw the situation. Hope this can help. regards

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I may sound stupid, but how do you "follow the trend" when using this strategy? How do you filter the bad trades? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
My first post with the system. My first +12 pips. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
We are not looking for BIG moves, fast in fast out. You try to scalp the little trend at this moment. As I posted before you can "ride" the main trend using other settings metioned in this thread. Use your knowledge about price action and your brain to filter bad signals. If you have ideas to improve the system you are welcome. But I will upload a "new" template. Then you will only take trades with the main trend. regards and green pips dynel14

--- 帖子 #82 ---
yes, the issue of repainting exists...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi, do you think it's possible to add some alerts? email alerts when all or some of the conditions are meet? Let us know when the new template is ready thank you

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Please read post 12 !!!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi migmac, unfortunately I have no idea how to do this, maybe you can ask some coders... Yes I will. welcome

--- 帖子 #86 ---
so are you saying they repaint or dont repaint ? because in my experience thery do...

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Had not thought that my english is so bad... This version does NOT repaint. If you and others do not like the indicator then change to MACD with 12,26,9. dynel14

--- 帖子 #88 ---
thanks for sharing very nice work keep it up

--- 帖子 #89 ---
The best filter to start with is time trading and frequency of trading. The hours traded need to be strict, it could be 3 hrs into London or just a few hrs in ny time. Whatever it is it must be th asame every day. Next you need trade frequency rules... Will you stop the day after one winning trade or one losing trade, or will you keep going during the hours you choose till you cut the day on a losing trade. These are just some ideas , but like any system, you need to regulate what happens after a loss or a gain. This is where everyone fails on manual trading. The biggest mistake is stopping on a winning trade but keep trying after a losing trade in the same day. This is how you lose 5 for every one win.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I took all trades using the setup in this thread but a lot of my trading decisions were based off of price action , buying dips and selling bounces against the "Ma in color" during the Ny trading hours. The market that day was very choppy so that type of trading worked very well in that environment. Other days i would have been murdered trading like this.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I managed 4 +post and 1-post (my mistake). Happy thanks Giving day guys... Sekian.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Guys, need some help to trobleshoot. i've downloaded the indicator, script and template that posted in #1 thread. however, my MT4 become slower when i start loaded the template. any suggestion to overcome this matter as it took few seconds delay to post a position, draw lines, etc in MT4.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Try to reduce - max bars in history (2000) - max bars in chart (2000) That will help your speed and You can also reduce pairs that you don't need on market watch window. Cheers

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi @ll, hope you had a nice weekend. Like I've announced, here the new template for you. Hope this works better and filters more bad signals. New rules INDICATORS 1) Semafor (repaints) 2) LWMA 25 3) Trendline (CCI + RSI Combination) 4) SnakeForce 5) Extreme Identifer (repaints) Rules LONG : - Semafor On BOTTOM (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close ABOVE LWMA 25 GREEN ( max. 3rd candle! ) - Trendline GREEN - SnakeForce GREEN ( max. 3rd bar! ) - Extreme Spike On BOTTOM Rules SHORT : - Semafor On TOP (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close BELOW LWMA 25 RED ( max. 3rd candle! ) - Trendline RED - SnakeForce RED ( max. 3rd bar! ) - Extreme Spike On TOP Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London (07:00 - 17:00 gmt) TF = M5 TP = + 15 pips (+10pips) &lt;- it is all up to you! SL = -20pips &lt;- it is all up to you! BE = +10pips (if you like...) Risk = 2-5% In the template you will find examples. Wish you a green week! dynel14

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hello Dynel14, Did You took the CCI 15 indicator off the system? Bye

--- 帖子 #96 ---
my opinion you should take off "Extreme Identifer", but not CCI 15. its really useless coz repainting often in 1m tf (i prefer 1m)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi Forex Girl and scalperlamer, no it is included in the trendline. If you want to see it add the CCI Histo from the first template. I know to handle it, but thanks. If you don't like it please remove it from the chart. Also I don't trade M1 with this system. regards, dynel14

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Oh, I´ve saw it! It´s ok for me. Thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
i noticed the lwma isn't in the new template. does the new trendline indi replace the lwma? so we now wait for the price to cross the trendline as the first signal? thanks

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Just a couple of points about the indicators. The color of the candles incorporates the LWMA. A green candle means it closed above the LWMA and a red candle means it closed below the LWMA. As for the CCI, it is incorporated in the new line that is plotted that replaced the LWMA. That's how I see it. Of course, I'm new here myself, but I hope that helps. PJ

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hello dynel14, Thanks for the update and thanks again for the awesome system. I just wanted to point out that I loaded the template and the examples you marked are not right. I think the vertical lines change with the broker times. I compared your image to my chart and the lines are off by a few bars. i can see the candles where they are supposed to be, but they are off slightly. Ok, I see that the vertical lines are off more than slightly. As I suspected, they are off because of broker times. They are two hours different on my charts. PJ

--- 帖子 #102 ---
fired off 2 shots and put some pips in the bag testing it out in early trade. +14 and +8 looks like LWMA has been removed, i added it back in to test things out. also, i think there will be some confirmation trades down the road using the 15 min next to the 5 as i have here. For example, we are in a strong downtrend bigger time frames, so the next buy signal would be better if it were confirmed some bullish areas on the 15 min system. Right now, the 15 min is bullish because of the gap. so from here we should wait to take more shorts off the 5min on pullbacks only when the 15 min is bearish to help confirm this gap is not going to turn into a big reversal . On the flip side, the next bullish signal on the 5min is already confirmed on the 15, so should be a good one if it goes bull from here. Just some ideas on how this setup can be used. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Here is the second trade tonight. Using 15 min as confirmation, took the 5 min long signal( green arrows on left chart), 2 bullets +16 and +10 also note here the daily open line, we can see strong resistance here but lack of a pull back on the 15 min chart and failure to break down the 5 min. There are probably more pips to the upside here but there is still a gap, it is only 10pm ny time on Sunday open and both trades already hit the profit target area of 10 pips+. this is a risky time to be doing this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thank you, right!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Ok I see. Will remove the lines and post some charts.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi, yes the visual LWMA has been removed, the candles represent the crossing with the MA like swingdjpj said. nice trading! regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi Dynel14 First, thank you very much your system. Why change a trade expert? TP and SL is not working. The TP and SL changed? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
You're welcome. I've added some scripts for BUY and SELL with TP and SL. Just drop it to the chart. If you don't like it, use the Visual Order Editor from the first template.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
nice signal this morning...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
at the moment there is a valid sell on E/U. I didn't take it because uptrend is strong at the moment, could just be a strong pullback.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I think it could help others if you show us some charts... thank you dynel14

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Ok! ps: seems now that it was a profitable entry :-)

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Jap this was profitable, but not according to the new rules. I also noticed that you change the trendline (RSIPeriod). Anyway congratulations for the green pips. Trade like you want to... dynel14

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks Dynel14 for sharing your method on FF. If anybody can help me, i am having difficulty with the Snakeforce Indicator. It is not showing up on my chart using the template or placing the indicator on the chart. I know this question was asked before earlier in the thread and answered however I tried to compile it to the meta editor without success. If anyone can give me a bit more instructions on the steps to make the indicator successful on my chart I would really appreciate it. Sorry for the technical question on this thread...Thank You.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Try this. dynel14

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Another signal...

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thank You Dynel14, it worked like a charm.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
ehmmm...scalping.... your setup Kind a remind me for the old times.... good work dynel.... Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
thanks for the nice words! OK guys, 2 signals today = +30pips (or more...) see you tomorrow! dynel14

--- 帖子 #121 ---
thanks for sharing this great system dynel... i caught the two trades you outlined on today's chart, but am i right in thinking that would also have qualified as a long entry at 15.25? - MA candle is green - semafor and symphonie on bottom - snakeforce is green - cci &amp; rsi line is green am i missing something? keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #122 ---
dynel14, Thanks for the pips. If your ever in Central Florida, I'll owe you a drink. Today was good. On that second signal of the day, I rode my runner for 60 pips. Just followed the MA with my stop. and finally closed it out when it got near the Daily Open Line. Good Trading All, PJ

--- 帖子 #123 ---
really nice I'm looking for the next flight...

--- 帖子 #124 ---
In backtesting the 4th bar/candle gave mixed results. so yes you could have taken this one, but I would not recommend it or you know what you do (price action etc.) regards

--- 帖子 #125 ---
This was my first try using "Scalp the Trend". Today, I have 3 GU entry with 2 wins and 1 BE. (Yellow vertical line is my entry) Thanks Dynel.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Dynel. Yesterday, You entered the short in your 2nd entry. I was a same position with you, but I thought that the main trend at that time was bull for short-term. How do you usually determine the trend?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I got the another +10pip in EJ. In asian session, I took small profit, but need to be cautious. So I like JPY pair rather than USD pair in assian session. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Well done!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi septell, read the 3 threads on post1. But look at the chart and you will see that there was a lower high and the bears defended 1.34000 regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Thanks for response. Dynel. One more EJ +15pip just right ago. Today's total +25pip only EJ. ^^

--- 帖子 #131 ---
First trade this week. With old setup though, +10 on E/U long. Cheers

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well done guys! Tried GU this morning, +15pips Looks like it works with EU, GU, EJ. More to test...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
dynel. I have one question. The one of the Rules LONG is "Extreme Spike On BOTTOM" Does it mean just extreme spike or extream spike with color ? In the thread of SEFC GoldSuperCycle , "Evaluator" said that just extreme spike with color is meaningful.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi bant, I use both, but it depends on price action. dynel14

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I took two trades today both were winners + 20 Cheers

--- 帖子 #136 ---
can someone tell me why my snake force indicator looks different than yours? Thanks for your answer Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #137 ---
settings

--- 帖子 #138 ---
great system, i have two question, while getting any entry, should i check the M15 or higher time frame too? and extreme indicator ver-2, bottom and top showed up with color, is that any advance entry signal?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
there is no set rule on checking higher time frames. but i am finding with signals i am not really sure about that checking the 15min and using it as confirmation is very helpful. if the market is not moving fast you will notices there is a lot of chop trades on the 5 min while the 15min may be holding ground in one direction.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
can you post the indicators seperately in mq4 or ex4 format. thanks

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I entered 2 short entries a few minutes ago. One is for EJ and the other is GU as below. And now...wait... UPDATED : 2 WINS +30pips ^^ (This is the 6th WIN in a row.)

--- 帖子 #142 ---
very good! do you use skype?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
what do you think about these entrys? all entry were corect? Thanks all

--- 帖子 #144 ---
What do YOU think?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Well done!

--- 帖子 #146 ---
you will need 10sek. to download and extract the file. if you have problems with some files tell me which one. regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #147 ---
i am interesting if was my last entry corect. thanks all

--- 帖子 #148 ---
+15 pips

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I took the same trade but i got SL. dynel14, how could you filter the bad signals or do you check the larger timeframes as a confirmation? Because there were 4 bad signals on my chart. Do you recommend 15m TF? happy pippin

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Excellent, simple system....kudos to dynel14 for sharing..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Exactly same trade with you. ^^ Thanks.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thank you! Welcome

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Am I the only one that took this trade? it's better to trade on 15m TF I think.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Can you show us all the 4 bad signals please? On EU I see 2 (1 more but not valid will explain later) signals. thank you

--- 帖子 #156 ---
When I checked that period again, as I see there was just 1 bad signal. The next 3 signals have not confirmation on Snake Indicator. 3 of them are my mistake, I controlled them again. 1 bad signal is maybe because of yellow support line. I don't know just want to filter the signals i attached the chart of this morning (5M EU chart) By the way thanks for this excellent system dynel14!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Sorry if the answer to this question is obvious....(you'll see this is my first post) I have been trying to understand this system (and forex!) over the last couple of days and haven't been able to make all of the signals line up so haven't made any trades (all demo of course!). The main problem seems to be that there is almost always a semafor pointing the wrong way on the latest open candle or sometimes the one before. See the first screen shot in post #141 as an example. The semafor below on the latest candle should mean that the rules for a short aren't met, or do I ignore the semafor on open candles. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #158 ---
can someone please post the indicators seperately !

--- 帖子 #159 ---
For all who had problems to "read" the semafor (if so you had also problems to see the trend HH/HL LH/LL) chage the settings to 40/100/200.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
well done mike1!!! do your homework! the 1 bad signal wasn't a bad signal...look at the left and look at the semafor/trend..HIGHER LOWS / HIGHER HIGHS

--- 帖子 #161 ---
1. no trade (see above) 2. +15 3. +15 2 valid signals = +30pips

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi dynel14, I am currently testing your v2 version and using the Buy/Sell scripts, can it be included to have a Move SL to BE after 8 pips as your strategy suggests? Thanks alot, Pix.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Dynel. What is the different between no.1 and no.2 trade? IMHO, no.2 trade might be considered as up trend. (There is HH and HL like no.1 trade, but at that time I had a same position with you.)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi Dynel14 The Symphonie Extreme indicator is very unstable. I look in parallel at the same time. Not the same sign. The broker both FxPro . How can I get a good signal? Help me, please.

Hi Huesa, here you can find everything about this indicator (all problems/solutions/tipps) dynel14

All right. I think that changed? You have ideas?

Hi, Dynel14 I think that changed? You have ideas? Thank you!

What changed? Please read the thread and you will also understand why and how the indicator works dynel14

--- 帖子 #175 ---
And the other rules are met??? Look only for the first or second or third candle after change. That is the result of your mistakes. Did you ever had traded before? Did you read the threads? Do you know the basics of price action? dynel14

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi,thanks for your answer. I had 16 trade, and I get 4 stop loss.my tp is 10 pip and sl is 20 pip, I read all threads . Excuse me can you explain my mistakes ? If the trend is up , and I get the TP OR SL can I trade again , if I get the new signal on the trend ? About the basics of price action I know , but not very good. Your system very powerful '!!!!!! Can you explain me to have a better trade "???? Please help me thanks . Can you help me about price action ? I only get 4 stop !! Thanks for your answer !!!!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
You didn't answer my question about the rules! You can find enough example here in the thread, also bad trades. Compare it and you will find your answer. You read all 3 threads? All the pages in one day? Ok if so your next "book" is http://www.babypips.com/school/ dynel14

I read all treats. I read it again . I have to see more trade and see when the result ,!! Very very nice !

--- 帖子 #179 ---
There was a perfect trade today after NFP . Looking at the chart below, even though NFP can be risky to trade, we had a clear 5 min signal after a spike high that was also confirmed with the 15 min chart. Not only that, before the euro broke down , it traded sideways and the 5 min signal managed to stay bearish as the 15 min rolled over further confirming the trade. There is a lot of discretion and trading experience needed using this system you can't take every signal. You must combine it with other trade setups( trends pivots, common sense), time of trading, choppy markets vs trending days.. I see some charts above with some bad trades, but there were longs right below R2 pivot after a failed high on a day that was slow and choppy etc.. These things humans can filter out with other trading knowledge . Its also why most automated systems fail and a great manual system like this with a decent trader can get ahead.

Thanks for your advise, dynel14 Does looking for HH HL LH LL in 5M chart is good enough for spot the trend? Do I have to look at higher TF like 1H or 4H? Thanks agian, your system is profitable.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Just read the 3 threads on post 1 and babypips and you will know what is necessary to determine the trend

So, you go for the 15 pips target,isn't it ? but what about your stop ? 20 pips? 30 pips ??

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Is the position correct ?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
In this case you were lucky. Please read the rules! dynel14

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi Dynel14, Thanks to share your knowledge with us. I understand how boring it might be to repeat and repeat again the rules. The thing is that I really thought I've respected it. Here's why : By respect the rules, you mean this : Rules SHORT : - Semafor On TOP (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close BELOW LWMA 25 - CCI 15 RED (&lt;= 0) - SnakeForce RED - Cycle Spike On TOP Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London TF = M5 (M15) Only trade the first combination after Semafor! The position I took: - Semafor was on top (even if against the trend, I've tried it because your first pic in the post is against the trend as well), - Candle cllose below "LWMA", - Snakeforce was red, and - Symphonie estreme inidcator on top as well. Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London TF = M5 I admit not to be sure to understand "REPAINT". Is it the reason why I'm wrong or something else again ? Thanks in advance for your answer.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Nice signal after failed top. This is how it's done!

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Dynel, either Mickael or I have the settings wrong for the snake because our charts are different. Here is the settings on my chart can you confirm are mine correct? Thanks HX

Hi there, Can somebody tell me if this was a valid buy signal? All indicators where pointing for a buy and also the price entered a strong support area. I didn`t go for a buy because i was afraid that it will be countertrend. Regards

--- 帖子 #271 ---
2 necre: valid signal

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thank you for the confirmation! It turned out that if i took the trade it would of been a Stop Loss hit. The 14:15 candle is a valid sell signal (i guess) and it`s going for TP. The problem is that i`ve missed it because i wasn`t in front of the PC. BTW - Can anyone please put an alarm on the MA Candles indicator so it will play an alert when a colur change occurs? Or maybe an alert on the snake border indicator... Regards

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Dear ImTooTrader, Thank You very much

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Here is a thought. This is what I do. You can set a price-based alert. I check the chart and see where the price will need to be to interact with the LWMA. (this is where the candle color change happens) I then put an alert to tell me when the pair trades at that area. It's not exact but it will at least tell me it's time to look at the chart. I know this level changes because the moving average changes, but I check my chart every 30 minutes or so if no alert sounds so that I can change where the alert is located.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
That`s a good advice! Thanx man, I will use this method until somebody will have the time to put an alert on the LWMA

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Ok, so I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. I had seen this alert but I didn't think it would work for what we needed because it alerted for a moving average cross. It never occurred to me to set one moving average value to 1 so that it would just follow the current bar. Thanks Dynel.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
??? You guys want an alert for the candle color change!? Just compare the 2 settings Ma Candles and Ma Crossover alert and you will get the "aha"-effect

--- 帖子 #279 ---
AHA!!!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
New buy signal. Please confirm LE: TP hit

--- 帖子 #282 ---
confirmed. the 15 min tf also looks to be turning here as well. signal is a good risk.

Hi Dynel, What is the signification of the grey rectangular area in the graph? I don't understand this frame. Thanks for your answer.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Market Session (London). Question for all: I can't understand how so many of you just load a new template/indicator and don't know or don't try to understand what they are doing!?!? It is your money!!! All the answers about indicators are in the settings. Will ignore every question about indicators (except new one). Sorry guys DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!! dynel14

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Sorry guy, you're right about this.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Dear Dynel, Just wanna ask 1 stupid question. How the trailing EA work which i've found in your 2nd version folder. the EA setting are : Profit Trailing : True Trailing Stop : 100 Trailing Step : 1 UseSound : true NameFileSound : cork_pop.wav

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Another question... Was this a valid sell or i schould of waited for a full red bar on the snake border? Also, please tell me what levels on TP &amp; SL are best to use on 5 min E/U. Regards

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Valid Buy LE: TP hit + 11 pips

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Necre, Well,If I can help in the wait of a Master.. For the sell signal,first note the price action.You can trace a strong downtrend and that was just a test of the upper band. I feel a lot more confident when the bar is bigger and crossed the zero line The buy signal seems correct even if I can't see your symphonie extrême indicator Because I see a lot of arrows on your chart before the trading session start, here's a remind. Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London (07:00 - 17:00 gmt) TF = M5 TP = + 15 pips (+10pips) &lt;- it is all up to you! SL = -20pips &lt;- it is all up to you! BE = +10pips (if you like...) Risk = 2-5% Happy trading, Mickael

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thank you. The arrows are just signals of the MA cross over alert. I use it because i cannot sit all the time in front of computer. On the exemplified sell signal i understand that it`s not necessary to have a full red bar on the snake indicator. Regards

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Necre, Where, may I ask have you determined that the snake indicator need not be a full red (or green) bar on the signal? It is not that way in the written rules and there are no examples of that in the charts that Dynel has posted. I understand that there are times when it is a good trade without our signal, as in your example, but that is the case with all trading systems and strategies. You will not get all of the good trades but you will get enough to be profitable as long as you stay with the plan. If you feel that you may have an exception that works for you, then by all means test and backtest to prove that it works and then add the exception to your plan. I think you will find if you look back over some examples of trades that you would have taken with that indicator not being one color, you would not win over the long run. all the best,

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi all, I'm short in a downtrend at 1.2972, but just to be sure, was that a correct entry ? Should I have close the trade when the green opposite pic on the extreme indicator appears ? Thanks for your reply Mickael

--- 帖子 #293 ---
My only thought on that would be to look to the left. You were right near recent support.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Again,is my buy entry correct ? Obviously, I don't expect just to have good signals but I want to be sure to respect the method. Thanks

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Read the rules about candles...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Three bars and Three candles maximum. Thanks Dynel and swingdjpj. Was there a solution to avoid the buy signal just after or it's just the loosing trades we have to deal with ?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
what i can see is the trend was down... With in first 3 three candle have to make the entry please?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I'm new on this thread, but i have a problem, loading the template i can't see Snake Force indicator, and i can't load it manually. It is on the same folder of the others indicators of this strategy...somebody can help me? Thank you

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Does anyone had this buying signal ?? I've opened another Demo account but with a different broker. Differences are a bit annoying

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Rules SHORT - Candle Close BELOW LWMA 25 RED ( max. 3rd candle! ) - SnakeForce RED ( max. 3rd bar! ) Rules LONG : - Candle Close ABOVE LWMA 25 GREEN ( max. 3rd candle! ) - SnakeForce GREEN ( max. 3rd bar! ) Rules here

--- 帖子 #301 ---
The indicator don't compile. Edit it and relace the "RED" value by "Red" and it will work.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thank you for help viddak, but i don't understand your advice. How i can edit it if i can't open it manually or loading the template? Sorry for my bad english.

Hi, I do not understand this rule: SnakeForce-GREEN or RED (max. 3rd bar!) I do not understand what I examine aa third candle? Candle color change after the third candle trade enter? Candle color change at the latest after the third candle of the color change SnakeForce good? Somebody help me, please

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hello Huesa, I´m sorry about the english, but I´ll try it. I´m not speaking for Dynel14, but I hope to help you. 1) RULES SELL: - CANDLE COLOR MUST BE RED . The candle color don´t change after 3rd candle. When Dynel14 said MAX. 3rd candle is about the TRADE ENTER. You have to enter only at the 1st, 2nd or maximun 3rd RED CANDLE , because after 3rd will be late! - SANEK FORCE MUST BE RED . You have to use the same understanding of the candles. Enter at the 1st or 2nd or maximun 3rd BAR. After this it will be late! BUY orders is the same thing, but the candle color and Snake Force must be GREEN. See the chart below. There are many others in this thread. Bye.

Chart is small to show the many entries using Dynel's system for last day or so. 5 wins, 1 loss(see red vertical line).

wrong entry. semafor was at the previous candle!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Please, be kind to explain once again my mistake. As far as i can tell, semafor was south of the 8:45 candle - that means BUY. Also everything else was on green. Thank you - have a great week Now i`ve entered a sell... ... LE - also SL

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I already said that before your entry there was a semfaor on top! (I saw it) And why you go short when the market makes new higher lows and higher highs!? Good week for you too but be careful.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
The semafor was on top on the next candle, it appeared only after i`ve entered long. In regard to general market feeling/sentiment, i`m not so good at guessing the trend. Also i have trubbels in controlling my emotions, this beeing the reason why i have a more mechanical aproach. Well, 2 losses on monday - hope for a quick recovery Regards

I must say that this system is very good, today I've opened only 4 trades and I'm $401.85 on profit

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Dyne, question for you, Can you explain the reason for your Daily OpenLine indi and how it affects your trading this system? Thanks ian

--- 帖子 #327 ---
quite a straight forward system, would like to see more examples

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Just use it to determine the trend, above -&gt; long...

--- 帖子 #329 ---
could you show me your entry in this day? please I mean dec 19 2011

--- 帖子 #330 ---
of course

--- 帖子 #331 ---
why the snakeforce indy doesn't work on my meta ? tnx

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Go to this post maybe it will work. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...79#post5198779

--- 帖子 #333 ---
as I said - this system is very good, but needs some changes... I'm talking about TP and SL levels... I noticed that during night hours it's better to set TP on max 5-8 pips and SL on 20 pips... during the daylight hours TP should be max 10 pips and SL around 30-35 pips... why? market at night is slow and during the day is dynamic, so price moves are bigger... setting SL is not easy - today on GBP/USD price hit my SL first and then went back and hit TP... but with more trades I think this system could be a one of the best ever made PS: sorry for my bad english

dynel14, I am always late to take a trade since my job dosen't allow me to be on the screen all the time, is there any alert that we can activate so it will alert us when a possible trade is near?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
The issue with alerts on this system is that an alert triggered by the indicators would still probably make you late to the game. If you get a signal that there is a buy, there would be some time that elapsed before you get to look, unless you are sitting at the computer. Here is what I do. Put a price level alert in at a price that is near the moving average, since it is the interaction with the moving average that causes the change in color of the candles and that is where the signals happen. The moving average will move, of course, but if you look every 30 minutes or so, you can move your alert. Happy Holidays everyone!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Use this

--- 帖子 #344 ---
guys, I would like to ask you something... when you are opening a new trade - do you use only candles and snakeforce colors or only extreme spike indicator? because I use the second method and sometimes price hit my SL levels and maybe this is the reason of loss trades... I will try to use the first method next week and hope that it will make good profits

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thank you for posting this thread I will try it beginning next week however I am not clear from where you start counting the candles and from where you start counting the snake bars. If someone can clarify this I would appreciate. Marry Christmas to all of you and maybe this is my Santa gift

Hello. Happy New Year, Folks. Dynel, I tried to make robot for your strategy. I added Bollinger Bands indicator. Folks, Plz, try this one for the test. Waiting for replies. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Dynell, Is this the same attachment from your post #94, or is this something else different? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Dynell, Also, can you tell me if support, resistance and pivot updated automatically or where must I obtain it from? I can't seem to figure out what M1 to M5 is. Thank you so much for the system.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
LWMA 25, CCI 15 and SnakeForce indicator combination are good. Better to trade without the other two indicators that repaint.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
guys, what's the best TF to trade for you - 5 or 15 min?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Does anyone have the LWMA indicator for download for MT4? I've looked everywhere. All I have is the LWMA crossover signal. There is a difference, right? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Going to try it, thanks. See post 1 . Auto update Use the best combination for you .

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Can you attach your version of the semafor indicator? It looks like it's alot easier to see. Thank you migmac.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Does anyone have the LWMA indicator for download metatrader4? I downloaded the new rar files but no LWMA indicator. Please give the set up for it with this system as well. Thank you greatly.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
What does this mean BE = +10pips (if you like...) ? Thanks dynel14 for this great system

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I believe it's "break even".

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I've never worked with robots before. Can you tell me how to set up with your attachment? Or is the attachment just an updated template of Dynel's system? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #373 ---

Hi Dynel! I have seen the opp. that You have taken on eu but did not enter because had no semaphore sign - it did not appeare on my chart. Thank You, Peter

--- 帖子 #384 ---
the best of all time strategy, thanks big friend!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
dynel14, om the attach graph, all conditions are meet at 1.30274 to enter at a long trade, after some time the semaphore appears at the top of one candle, will you get out of the trade as soon as you see the semaphore on top? Thank you

--- 帖子 #386 ---
gu looks interesting - according to me Peter

--- 帖子 #387 ---
This strategy is only for EURUSD Pair: EUR/USD Session: Frankfurt, London TF = M5 (M15) TP = +10pips (+8pips) &lt;- it is all up to you! SL = -20pips &lt;- it is all up to you! BE = +8pips (if you like...) Risk = 2-5%

So calm today what a nice move on eu and no signal - hmm, only one on gu, tomorrow the sun will shine again Keep smiling Best Peter

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I like the system. I did not have lot of time to trade this week and last week. Was infront of computer only for about 1 hour. I made one mistake on the $10 loss. I was looking at a different chart thinking it was the EUR/USD pair. Ignoring that mistake, with little time I spent on front of the computer it has yeilded good results. This is the live trading account. Was a bit nervous and very busy, and forgot to put the stop loss in some of the trades. Any way the stop loss would not have hit where I wanted to put it.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Sun is shining, isn't it Peter

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Thanks for sharing great system. Eur/Gbp was my mistake.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
thanks for you !! can you explain me about using the Price action ? which one you use it ? i 3 year trades . please help me , which one you use it in Scalp the Trend . please !!! there are a lot of thing that we can use it ! please help me , thanks

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I just love it, Thank you Dynel14, finally I got some positive trades, over +40 pips in two days. Made a few mistakes but that was ok considering I had a SL and a TS which some of them turned to be positive.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Can you post a screen shot please ?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi dynel14 , Your system/strategy has got potential!! I've read most of the posts in this thread but I'm a little confused with which latest versions of the indicators to use? Can you state or point out to any of your post that has information for this? Because I want to make sure that I've got all the indicators that are correct before trading. Thanks dynel14 .

--- 帖子 #402 ---
His 3rd and updated version(uploaded a few days ago) is located on the 1st post. It's a rar file.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Thanks SwissTrade! Btw, there are some indicators in version 1 that are not in version 3. Do I ignore this and just use ONLY the indicators in Version 3? THANKS!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Here are my latest trades all positive:

--- 帖子 #405 ---
hello dynel, how r U?????? i from India. I have one question i trading in Indian market for commodities so u tell me that this system is work for commodities. i try it but i see so many wrong signal

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hello, Dynel. Hello, Everybody. Are there any news about testing robot?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
You are welcome. Well done Yes. Well done again! Is this a question? Because I never have told something like this! But just respect price action and the basics and then tell us if this works.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
hello dynel i make new trading system on snake force but i get some problem with it. so please help to make it i send image tell when i exit and when i enter

--- 帖子 #409 ---
It is fine to make your own system with the indicator in this thread, but it is YOUR homework to make it profitable. So no I will not give a support for an other system, sorry. regards dynel14

--- 帖子 #410 ---
ok forget it. now tell me u identify this indicator which in this picture. please this time don't tell NO

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Dude, This thread is about this specific scalping system and how it is used. If you want to make your own system using this system as a foundation to your model, then test and perform your own due diligence instead of asking someone to do the homework for you. It's your system, for goodness sake. YOU tell us where the entry and exit points are, and how you derive at the conclusion. Just my .02 cents.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Hi anyone know where to get the buy/sell popup box which is posted on the pic by VegasFx on post#404? I'm looking for something similar instead of using the MT4 built-in buy/sell function.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
It is IBFX mini terminal indicator. Can anybody share it? Or similar one? Thanks! Frida

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Can any one help me to notice the signals, maby some one can mark the signals, that I could easier understand? pls

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Dynel, I am very grateful of your generosity in sharing your system. I am just curious in wondering what settings you have for the Symphonie Extreme Indicator? Reason I ask, I am getting a lot of signals generated from this particular indicator when testing, especially on the GBPUSD pair. Although I don't put much weight on this indicator as a stand-alone, getting a lot of signals makes me doubt the position at times. Appreciate your insight and time with respect to this. Warm Regards

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Not hard to find really good examples here in this thread

--- 帖子 #417 ---
You are welcome. I think your "problem" is: Tools - options - charts - max bars in history Tools - options - charts - max bars in chart I have the default settings: 512000 / 65000 Try this one. Regards

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I want to compliment Dynel for this marvellous system. Simple clean and .... profitable. I think it could become my main manual trading system. But me too really interested to mini terminal to enter orders. It could be a perfect add on for mt4 terminal order handling ....

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hey dynel, maby you can mark where are signals and post image ? it would be great

--- 帖子 #420 ---
dynel, Are you trading on 5 or 15 TF? You mention 5 in the first post but was wondering if you still use that or the 15 or longer? Danke.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
I did it the whole time M5

--- 帖子 #422 ---
EU short: min. 15pips

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Great trade. I saw that too but the extreme indi was not there. Do you sometimes bypass the extreme spike(colour) if we are ranging?

--- 帖子 #424 ---
The important thing is the trend and that comes first. The indicators are only for confirmation and entry and we all know extreme is moving with the trend. So sometimes you don't wait for the extreme (but you must have a feeling for it!)

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I know exactly what you're saying. Danke schon Dynel.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
This market are signals when to buy and sell ? sry for my dump questions I am newbie still.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Please read this post !

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Ok sry, finally understood i'll try it tomorow

--- 帖子 #429 ---
The Buy and sell Box is from IBFX it's considered an EA so you put it in the expert folder. I tried to put it on other broker account but it doesn't work it looks that somehow they make it to work only on their site only. If you have an account with IBFX you must download the latest version from their site which includes all these EA's, if your IBFX ver. is only updated it will not include them.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
60 pips today, but I can tell you you need to have a lot of patience with this system and don't forget to wait for 3 candles and bars

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Dynel, Good system. I have a question about scalp version 3, I downloaded. The Ma candles close bullish(lime) &amp; bearish(red). Not lime above 25 or red below 25. Version 2 is fine. I like having the alerts on the snake in version 3.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Dynel can you clarify the trading hours please. The templates come with 9-21 hours, but in the rules are 7-17 hours GMT. I use the 7-17 hours because my broker has the same time with GMT. Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
You are welcome. What is your question? v3 has the same Ma Candles indicator with the same settings.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
http://www.babypips.com/school/trading-sessions.html

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Semafor was on M3. Price touched the 1.2777 line support HH + HL. Everything turned green within the third candles. Did I miss something or is it just one of the few bad signals ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #436 ---
You need to follow the trend, it's new LL on your graphics. And you can see 1.2793 is big resistance. Sorry, English is not my native language.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thanks for your answer ! It's at least funny to see how for someone it's going up, and how the same thing is going down for others You'll see in the attached pic why I'm talking about HH and HL. Anyway, the 8.05GMT TIME buy signal was a good one !

--- 帖子 #438 ---
good sell

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I just got worried about the last semafor and prefered to wait...

--- 帖子 #440 ---
It is naver a bad decision Peter

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Great job. I made the same exact sell. I notice you're not using the extreme spike indikator? Is it not necessary?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
maybe, I simply do not understand how to use it, I do not know what it says.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
and here ? it's a good buy signal ?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hello my friends.... My trades for 9,10/1/2012... 21.26 $$$$$ all Green!!! Thank You dynel14

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I also jumped in as soon as the extreme spike disappear.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Dynel, In version 3 that I downloaded, the candles that that under the 25 line witch is not seen in version 3 are painting open &amp; closes as RED(bearish) &amp; Lime(bullish) BELOW the 25. SO, not all the candles BELOW 25 are RED like in version 2. And this is ture for the ABOVE 25 candles. This makes it hard to know when the 25 line has been crossed. They are not being painted RED or LIME as their position to the 25 line (ABOVE=Lime) (Below=Red). It's according to their Open &amp; Close prices. The verison 2 works fine though

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Dynel, I just loaded the version 3 to another MT4 account platform works fine. Maybe there was a problem because I had both version loaded to the same platform file. Oh well, all is good now! Thanks for the system. I'm putting more value in my pips(1pip=$100) to scalp 10 then shooting for 100 pip trades.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I didn't get in cause the PA was in a downtrend. According to you was that the right decision ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Yes well done, i was going to post that :

Hi everyone. Im just start the Forex "adventure" I read this topick and try this system and...its looks awesome!!! I will test this in the next days. THX Dynel for this system!!! Imperatorfr where did you get this INVICTUS Indicator? Looks usefull...

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I found the problem with my charts with version 3. It wasn't V3's problem. It was mine. I was changing colors on the charts. An example: Right click chart; properties; common; chart on foreground (this was checked causing the problem). Unchecked (Chart on foreground) and the MA candles are the same as V2's. Sorry for the mix up.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hello Guys... I have a suggestion !! What if start a workshop here and put every good signals as like this : Buy/Sell @ 0.0000 TP @ 0.0000 and lets share it together ... Happy piping ... smowafy

--- 帖子 #453 ---
If Dynel has no problem then I'm all for it

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I agree with you smowafy bro, it will be helpful at least if we can do it for one week...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Well the most of you now understand how to work with the trend, nice If you want to share signals...do it. I have no time for it and will not give any. EU 10.01.2012: min. +45pips

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Scalpthetrend V3 has snakeforce with audio alerts. Can someone add an Email Alert to this?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Nice pips Dynel. I didn't pull the trigger on the eur/usd long though. Makes me nervous as hell every time I'm long the euro, so i sit put and wait for the top and reverse. Great system though. Still having to refresh extreme spike too often. Any fix at all for that? I have the refreshfix version.

Try this

deynel hi I've been using the v3 system, and I love it but I have not dared to use it for a real account ... I want to ask .. how to determine whether up or down trand because I am often wrong in taking a position ..? and if any of the indicators in v3 that can determine the trand?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Is this a valid entry?

Try to understand and check the prices!

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi Dynel, Thanks again for sharing your method. "Scalp the trend"... What a Great definition now that I understood the highly importance of price action into your method. Because we are scalping a m5 chart in the direction of the trend, we are most of the time at the very beginning of a new trend. So, I got a question concerning the management of the trailing stop. There's at least 4 ways to manage the TP. 1. A 15 pips target and that's it. 2. A 15 pips target and the trailing stop in case of a reversal. 3. Just the trailing stop. 4. Support or resistance in a higher TF (Fib, etc..). Could you kindly tell us, what you personnaly use ? Did you have enough time to test each of those ways ? Regards and lot of green pips to you

--- 帖子 #479 ---
HI Mickael, this is all up to you and your money management/ risk reward! 15pips are the minimum profit after a valid signal but you can "ride" the trend longer if it is possible!

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Snake indicator has now alert (thanks @eric!) If Eric is reading could you add an E-mail option for the Snake. or anyonelse?

--- 帖子 #481 ---

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Nice !! Feel free to post your chart as well.I personnaly don't get that much entries as the PA was not that clear ..

--- 帖子 #486 ---
HI Dynel, I got 2 question for you: 1. Why didn`t you take a previous short on the 16th of january, before the first buy order? Is it because more then 3 snake force bars where already red when the price went below the rsi cci indi? 2. On the same chart you`ve posted, there`s no symphonie indicator. Why is that? Regards Necre

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Necre, 1. Reason is already in the chart (trade 1 ) 2. No reason for that. dynel14

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi there, Can you please post the scripts and the trailing expert and help me with some advice on how to use them? Thank you

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Thank you You mean that on m15 the trend was going north . Another question for you... If you already hit the 15 pip TP and after a bref consolidation, another long signal appears, do you take it? Or you only wait for a short setup at this moment? (For example, on the 17th, between your trades, there`s another buy signal that you didn`t take - and i`m trying to understand why)

--- 帖子 #490 ---
If the trend is up and a new signal appears why don't take it? Show me where?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Ive edited the previous message... sorry ... For example, on the 17th, between your trades, there`s another buy signal that you didn`t take - and i`m trying to understand why.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
On the orange line

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Look at it again and count the green candles...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
In those days with more volatility we must see the higher trend! M15 TF was in an uptrend! So we prefer longs ! Look at the second picture (M15) where our trades are EU: +60pips ( +40pips with the short) You like it or not

--- 帖子 #495 ---
OK, i`ve got it! Thank you for the effort. Regards

--- 帖子 #496 ---
You are welcome!

--- 帖子 #497 ---
I hope i`m not bothering you with all my questions. The last one for today... why the orange line is not a valid sell? I didn`t take it because i only took the buys today, but still, isn`t it a valid sell? Than you dynel.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Normally I would ignore this question, because I have answered it several times, but for you again: M5 higher high! Look to the left and M15 is in uptrend.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Well done Dynel, I stayed on the M5 and took the first sell at 12H05. Support 1.2320 breaked + previous HL breaked 13h05 was a good sell. 3rd trade on BE. And No more trade during a ranging day. -5 pips. All in all not that bad for such market. Any comments to help me improving again? Thanks

17 day 09:05 can u explain this sygnal, why you shosen to buy ? Rules LONG : - Semafor On BOTTOM (BUT follow the trend!!!) - Candle Close ABOVE LWMA 25 - CCI 15 GREEN (&gt;= 0) - SnakeForce GREEN - Cycle Spike On BOTTOM there was no spike on bottom :O

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Your counting/determination of the highs and lows is wrong. Focus on the semafor or add ZigZag.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hello,i found this thread,and i see this system are logic.But in some case i still don't catch the point of good and bad entries. In this picture i marked my short entry.As i understand CCI and Snake H2 must confirm each other by the same color.And Thierry with MA was the same color,in this case was red.And i decide to enter.My first enter with this system and -25 pips (SL was 20,but i change SL by moving above Resistance line). Thanks in advance for all comments and explanations.

Welcome. Read the whole thread and post 1 again and hopefully you will find the answer

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I have explained how the Extreme indicator behaves, you will find the answer in this thread and in the SEFC GoldSuperCycle Trading System thread.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
OK. I think I got it this time. HHHL,LHLL are defined by semafor. Let me try : to SELL, the last semafor as to be on top (but at the moment of the signal, the price has sometimes already break the last low, and on the signal candle appears the semafor.In this case only, there's no matter to go short, and to ignore the semafor,cause it's another confirmation of the new trend) that's exactly what you've want to explain by follow the trend. And that's why I've missed so many good trades !! I was afraid of the very last semafor when it was just another confirmation !!! Thank you so much !! reading this all thread and asking questions worth it.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi nasdakas, I think dynel mentioned (several times) that while the indis are there to aid us with entries/exits, we should look at the overall trend. In your case, at that point of time I believe EU is on an uptrend then. Taking a counter-trend trade is possible but riskier. Fyi I took a trade last night as well on EU but LONG instead. Any misinterpretation please excuse.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi ririz99, thanx for your explanation.I see that in the begining a counter-trend trade is not the best way to trade.For safety i changed CCI from 15 to 45.Maybe it will help to avoid mistakes. Have another question - what is the meaning of numbers inside 3 Level ZZ Semafor indie? 1,2,3.It shows some levels of what?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
It's already found in the V3 in Page #1 GL

Unfortunately I don't have the answer myself; must admit I didnt read up the 3 threads posted in the 1st posting but you should be able to find the answer by either: 1. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=276813 2. google for "semafor indicator" 3. Search for "semafor indicator" in this forum

Hi @ll, this is my last screenshot with explanations! I think you have enough examples how to trade the market with this system! Today was a good day EU: +60pips (+45pips without the re-enter )

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Thank You, peter

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I think: Anyone who wants to use this system, first theory about the trend, and price formation, etc.. Dangerous not to know the basic. This system is the basic rule + dynel14 rule:it works! If only you are looking for red-green change: loss will be long term. The forex market is not that simple.Several things should be observed simultaneously. That is know the human brain.Me only good intentions. do not want to offend anyone. Sorry for bad English.

Thank you for your share

hello dynle how r U????? I download your version 3 but indicator r not work only snake alert is work

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi,i think Dynel get to much questions about technical data. Everything works, you only need to look attentive and i think you will find why some indies does not showing or not working.You need put system data to right directories of your trading platform.Just check again.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Dynel, Are you not using the extreme indicator anymore? I didn't see it in your last screenshot. Looks like a much cleaner screen. Thank you. Also, can you post your default settings for each indicator? I want to make sure it's set up exactly as yours. Thank you once again.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
One more question. I know you trade on the 5 TF but what TF are you drawing your fibo? Danke

Hi, septell Why do we need to be cautious in Asian Session? Is there any particularity? Thank you

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Marcio, i guess you are totally new to forex... like dynel has already said, babypips.com is the best place to learn the basics of forex. I think you should try it ;-) Cheers

Thank you Cheers, I'm studing the market, and until I know in asian session there is low volatility, right? Thank you.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have a couple question about 3 trades today. 1.) 1st trade = perfect entry (no question) 2.) 2nd trade = Question, The SnakeForce turned up a 1/3 of the way, is this an Entry? or does the SnakeForce have to be a solid bar? 3.) 3rd trade = Question, Is this a continuation entry?

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Great system Dynel

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I find it intriguing that 2 different indicators with totally different settings can look the same on 1 chart. Dynel compare this indicator with your Thierry RSI and CCI i ndicator

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Trade the settings and template I gave you The same. But you can draw at every TF you want! Just go with the trend, no secrets!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
The same rules! Well done! Look at my examples and you will find the answer! Thank you Yeah interesting! You can also compare with the Symphonie Trendline or Supertrend indicator.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Dynel, What is your settings for the 3zz semafor and CCI/RSI? I'm using a new comp so I want to make sure I'm set up correctly? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
What does the SnakeForce measure? There are some bars that paint only half way or less. The alerts I get from this indicator are sometimes mixed. Example; Alert "snake turned UP" but the bar is still RED, after this alert it may be a few bars until it does turn UP "GREEN". Is there a place to read how SnakeForce works, I would like to learn more about it. I didn't find it in the 3 post on the 1st page.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I don't think the snake si needed at all. In my statistics of past trades there is no difference between number of lost and win (actually there are more wins) trades which were token when the snake did not show the right color yet. On the other hand, the rule of max 3 candles in the color of trade is helpful.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
thank Dynel i will go live tomorrow

--- 帖子 #544 ---
my dear friends i suggest you to beware from zulutrade , i am one of the biggest signal providers, (i was a while no. 1 rated signal provider) i did request my money 3 month ago , but they never pay me, when i chat to tham they are promising me - until the end of the day or until the end of the week, but they don't pay, it seems to be a scam !!!

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi. thanks for the great system. I wish to ask just one thing about the rule. The rule says "(max. 3rd candle!)" What does this mean? Does this mean "You need to give up entry if you didnt get signal before you get 3rd same color bar?" Sorry for my really bad english. I really wish to get an answer. I read the whole thread but my english is too poor to understand. If dynel is very busy, someone please answer this question. regards, Gothic47

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I'm so confused on when to actually buy/sell. 1) Do the colors of the semafors matter / mean anything? 2) the rules say buy at the "max 3rd candle." Does this mean that when a semafor says to buy, you must do so within the first three green bars that appear even if there are many red bars before that happens? Or does it mean that the very next bars must be green and then you trade? 3) Does an ambiguous snake signal count? What I mean is when one bar is both green and red.

Gooday dynel14,pls how do i put the e.a in the expert advisor?thanx a great deal.

I like the snake. Anyone knows if it repaints? From my experience on 1M TF, it seems not, but you never know if you are not a coder and look at the source code. The Snake does provide a view of the current mini trend strength. I am experimenting with another system but with Snake, it could filter out from bad trades

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi guys, After reading the first few pages, dynel14 said that the Snake does not repaint... But the settings (cperiod =24) does not work well when price is ranging in M5, but work great in trending times as all system does But with all the filters and we look at PA first before looking at snake for confirmation, i think it does work if patience is taken seriously... no haste for signals Will give it a test next week. But i will be using HA candle instead, the candle comes with the template gives me a headache thanks dynel14 for the system. Hope it will give me better trades

--- 帖子 #553 ---
hi, is this used better in smaller or bigger time frames? also, should i use it during the asian sessions? it seems to gives a lot of fake entries during the asian session. I was using the 5min TF at that time.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
try to use 15min chart - it works for me

--- 帖子 #555 ---
A/U trade from Asian market this morning. 8 lovely pips. rest of day off till Europe opens. ;-)

--- 帖子 #558 ---
This is one of the best system i have seen,i am also trying to use it to trade binary option.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi guys, does anyone still use this system? Do you think it is suitable for current market conditions in 2014? please share your results. Cheers

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Great work
