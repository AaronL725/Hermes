Having mainly lurked on FF for a good while I have decided to share my trading methodology to help my fellow traders. I have studied the art of internet forum trading for over a decade and think I have finally got the hang of it. I believe in Karma (and have also met his wife). In life you have to pay it forward, plus I think it's high time I got some gullible newbies to forward test this load of rubbish because, frankly, I can't be bothered. What else? Oh yes, some mumbo- jumbo about God always goes down well, so: God is my guiding light as the markets are divine and may the angels guide you in your quest. So without further ado. Here are the rules of the method. please feel free to comment, add questions, post charts, add indicators, whatever you wish. As you all know, 95% fail and that includes all of you and also myself. Did you know that there are maybe 5 consistently profitable professional traders in the entire world, against however many other market participants? ALL go broke in the end. Now, how many people have won the lottery? Yes folks, your odds of winning the lottery are in fact better than you a small time retail trader with a $10,000 dollar account EVER becoming successful as a trader. And yet you still try! Because somehow, against all the odds, you, a clueless retail trader with a free copy of MT4 and some graphs are SPECIAL. You are the one who is going to make it and become FREE. Free and more importantly, RICH! Free from the drudgery of the day to day of sitting in an office, staring at a PC for 8 hours plus every day, free from the rat race, your own person, not subject to the whims of anyone, in charge of your own destiny. Hey, I'm merely trying to spread the love. Plus, of course, if all goes well the thread will run to 2000+ posts of utter nonsense and confusion and I might be able to start some side vendor thing off it - maybe a private forum or something? At least sell some PDFs on Ebay anyway. While teaching full time on FF, generally pontificating, changing rules to please, posting hindsight charts etc and pointing you all in the right direction, I will also be working a full time job for my employer, running a successful business, operating as a property developer and entrepreneur and having an affair on the side. All of these are possible once the realities and freedoms of being successful in the Forex transpire. So rules: these are specifically designed to be ambiguous and incomplete. 1. Monthly charts for analysis 2. Entries based on yearly outside bars 3. Also take note of the 7 minute, 35 minute, 5 hour, 19 hour, 3 day and 5 week charts....that should do it 4. Enter when you feel like it in any direction 5. Use a stop loss of no more than 7 pips plus spread 6. Your aim is to keep taking losses until you don't, i.e. you must run your winners, you do this by closing losers at 7 pips and never closing winners, not ever 7. Once you don't take a loss, never close the trade, not ever, until the high or the low of the year in the opposite direction is reached. 8. Only trade in the direction of the trend. Define this anyway you like: I can then always argue you were trading against the trend when it all goes wrong for you 9. Any indicators can be used as you see fit: after all they are all completely useless. 10. Things such as margin, leverage, rollover costs, opportunity costs, scalability etc are all completely irrelevant. 11. You must sit and monitor your trading screen 24 hours a day for this to work 12. Psychology, discipline and money management are very very very important. Make sure you've read Trading in The Zone, Elder, Gann, Darvas, O'Neil, Dow, Wyckoff, Elliot, Nison, Ross, Mystic Meg etc then throw them in the bin. They're utter drivel! 12. Keep on dreaming Is that unclear enough? Good Charts to follow.

You made my day

--- 帖子 #3 ---
lol. the 7 pip methodology and yearly outside bar thing might actually work. maybe you just have to close all trades at the end of the year. haha.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
As many as you can get are also allowed for this method: we're here to realise that it's all a game and that there are no winners. Charts to follow

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I got bored LOL. P.S. GU was an outside bar last year, does it mean we get downtrend for the entire year!?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
brilliant

--- 帖子 #7 ---
OK. This is the yearly chart. This is your market map. Your aim is to always position yourself at the extreme of the market - that way you can get in and literally hold for YEARS off a 7 pip stop

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Of course, unless price hits the all time high. Then go short.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
No. You did not just share the holy grail with everyone, now how do I make my pips.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
you're selling something aren't you? I can tell by your tone

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Why short when the trend is up? Price is at an all time high. The greatest chance of entering with 7 pip stop is from where it's likely price will go no higher. Do you want to buy/sell retail or wholesale? Which direction has the greatest potential? Did you want to be long from the low? Of course. Can you afford to position yourself from the all time low and hold? Of course not. No one currency can go up or down against another currency forever, never going to happen. Maximum potential is from the high or the low. So when at an all time high, go short, all time low, go long. Other than that, trade the trend.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
not yet got to build up my customer base first

--- 帖子 #13 ---
It does work. I ran the stats.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
10 pips sl and 250 pips tp is the x-factor I backtested it for you master...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
What pairs did you back test this on ?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
all we need now is an EA...and we are all set for life

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Then add in money management. If you close a single position. Reopen from the high or low extreme on a min 75% ret, still only risking 0.5% of capital but resized with your winnings. You can have it ALL :nerd:

--- 帖子 #18 ---
All, there can only be one highest high and one lowest low. Price moves thousands of pips between the two. 7 pip stop, 0.5% risk, infinite gain.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You can't do it with an EA, they can't do visual comparisons and you can't program pinning the tail on a donkey while blindfolded and smashed on mocaine. Not yet anyway.

I've never felt the need before, and don't understand why people have to tell the world, but now I feel the need to say, "Subscribed"

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Welcome

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I'm very surprised there hasn't been a large number of posts saying 'thank you for this amazing method, I tried it today and won 10 pips' yet. Puzzled. In order to make this a success I need a few shills. Come on now. I'll even let you in on a profit take basis on the private group when it gets going in a few years.

You forgot working out at the gym on your six pack, attending boxing classes and walking the dogs (most likely rescued from the local RSPCA) along with dining at the finest restaurants and partaking of the best whiskey.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Were you referring to abs or beer ??

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Are you testing me Slim? Well if your gym has a bar, you can work on both, but gurus generally don't drink beer, it's usually whiskey that they will mention.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Done for the day, off to the gym: Back and Biceps Then followed by a game of golf: golf is of utmost importance to trading. I prefer getting smashed on Mocaine.

nunrgguy, if you play your cards right, your thread could become bigger than the "AMAZING Strategy" thread!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
With any trading method it should be plain as day in which direction to trade. Otherwise you're just gambling.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Why long from there? Price hit a line but did not close over it. Which line? The one I drew here Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When scalping I prefer to use the 34 hour chart and the 8 second chart

Thanks. Have you tried the method yet and won 10 pips?

Maybe this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Is price up or down on this timeframe? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #38 ---
No, not yet... You see, I'm pretty tough, I can sleep only 4-5 hours per day, but your rules say: So I'm tough, but not tough enough. When I'll be able to trade 24 hours per day without sleeping (I'm working on it), I'll start trading your system. I believe it is a great system and any follower could become a millionaire in no time!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
That's unfortunate - watching the screen is quite imperative: the market won't move if you don't.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes, I understand. I'm sure the thread participants can train themselves to watch the screen without any sleep. Of course some of them would end up in the mental institution, but who cares? It's their problem!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Tomorrow I think I might introduce my concept of 'HakiNarishi Doshimomo', which very roughly translates as 'Bends time with stale wind'. I don't know though, it may be too early.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
That's the spirit! You're the man! What is important - don't listen to anybody, don't let some smart alecks to tell you what to do and how to do it! It is YOUR thread! If you think it is the right time to introduce your groundbreaking concept "Bends time with stale wind" - go for it! If you think the traders' world is not ready for it yet - take your time!

Finally! THE thread is here! Also, I am fairly certian that you are aware of the powerful eastern chants that will move price in your desired direction. BUT please don't rush and introduce the masses to these yet. Wait for confirmation.

Forex Factory Traders, MetaQuotes Has Lied to All of Us! Warning to all Forex Factory users of MT4, Do not upgrade to v600 build of MT4! Fellow Forex Factory traders, MetaQuotes has lied to all of us. They claim this new upgrade runs MQL4 indicators in their proper runtime environment without any problems. This is a flat out lie! And once you have upgraded, you cannot go back! MetaQuotes has become uncaring about traders and greedy for profits. This is all about them making profits off of their "Store" feature, where they and others can sell indicators of new coding. And they have effectively prevented many of all the free and open coded indicators from running! Yes, they have published a long drawn out affair as to why some things won't work, but it is all a bullshit excuse circumventing the fact that they haven't produced a program to convert all of our old indicators so they will run. They expect users to figure out what the hell is wrong, and then become coders themselves to recode so their indicators will work,.........or they expect you to buy replacement from their F....king store!~ Call your brokers and demand that you be allowed to continue the last pre-v600 build or you will go to a broker that will! -tah

Hi, maybe can add in how u have reached nirvana with ur 20 plus years of trading, and now want to set the Gold standard in teaching forex and ur method. And later being coerced to start a private forum because u have garnered so much followers. And start creating some esoteric terminologies to define candle formation which simply have no proven edge. And create a veneer which extols positive psychology that u r the edge and such craps. This will work. Looking forward to more from u.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I can't imagine Metquotes stopping indicators working - after all if traders stopped using indicators they'd become more profitable and that would mean less profits for Metaquotes main clients?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Welcome my friend. I see you too have in insight into the inner workings of The XXXX. I started this because something has changed in my life and I wish to share what I know, pay it back if you wish. I will select a number of people from this thread to be groomed as students. Please do not ask how and why - it will become apparent who is worthy. All I ask is that everyone is polite and asks no questions about me and my motivations. Then we'll all get on cushty.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
When I started my MT4 today it upgraded without my approval or opportunity to stop it

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I know someone who knows someone who heard someone say that this was foretold in an ancient text. A guru would rise up from the fabled land of FF and put an end to world poverty. One day everyone will follow this system and we will all be billionaires. How do I become accepted into the inner circle ??

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hallo nunrgguy, Is that any possibility to be one of your student? What is the condition? Thanks and Regards, anton

--- 帖子 #54 ---
.....And btw probably the best First Post ever on FF.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Guys, nunrgguy already said: Guys, pay attention, will you?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The thread keeps getting better Stuff here is absolute gold.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Unfortunately you have not succeeded in your quest. Those who are worthy will become apparent.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Did you have another go of going long from the yearly low? Stop loss 7 pips? Or are you convinced the trend is still down?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
1 minute chart, first bar on record Which way is the trend?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
One of the secrets which will follow: momentum indicators on none time based charts

--- 帖子 #64 ---
So weird how much sarcasm is apparent, but u are still actually trying to portray something meaningful. Price moves hundred or hundreds of pips from the low or high, so why are you not making hundreds of pips?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
It is like a Christhoper Nolan movie. Different interpretations are open to all. All are right and wrong as well. Whichever version we find more convenient and "logical", we can go with that. Meanwhile the movie has already made shitload of money.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
"The banks use the 200, 100 and 50 MA, these are important MAs and price reacts to them" This is the first weekly bar of all time. There were no MAs because 200 weeks had not yet passed. So the banks didn't trade.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
If this was the first bar of all time, there was no preceding bar and the markets were only open this week and no bar would follow, how would you trade it?

No-one on a forum will 'teach' you how to trade. It can only be learned by experience.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
How many hours per day are you sitting, slave to a computer, staring and what you THINK are the markets? This is your 'freedom' Or is this just another form of slavery?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You wanted to trade so you didn't have to work. So you didn't have to answer to anybody. So you could be free.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Instead you work hours and hours per day, wasting your existence in a futile exercise using flawed methodologies, trying to overcome losses, trading costs and the spread. Every available hour is spent, watching the 'markets' Every free hour you waste studying the 'markets' You don't have free time, you need to be watching the market, slave to the market. You are not free, you are not rich, you are merely the market's b1tch.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
And even then, with all of that experience of absolute, diabolical failure, you'll still go on a forum and tell a beginner (how DARE you play with someone's life like that!) that xyz works (do you know???): check out this thread, the information is superb - it's what gave you YOUR grounding in losing That this method is superior to that method (you have absolutely NO idea) That it doesn't matter that one broker's 4 hour bar looks different to another as it all averages out(really - you have years of statistical data backing this up do you??). 95%. EVERYTHING ANYONE tells you on ANY forum is WRONG.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Incorrect. All are wrong. PERIOD. Only the market is right.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
BTW: Losing: what you all do Loosing: no idea, none existent word

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Loosing: to set free, or release... "I am loosing the hounds" I really can't be bothered to read the last 5 pages, so can somebody send me the EA? Thank you please. Oh, and then take me step by step how I install the files. You can take the subsequent silence as thanks, after you've painstakingly guided me through the process.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Don't forget to post a photo of either: (a) yourself (b) your dogs or, as it may be, cats (c) your workstation. You know, insert the human element. Then tell people that you really don't have the time to trade for them because you have so many big clients. The Madoff rejection. So the next time they come back, you can scoop even more funds. By the way, it's non-existent . Not none existent. If you are going to pull people on their grammar, at least get it right

95% of what you have said in this thread is Wrong? is this correct? (see above)

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The word does exist though. v. loosed , loos·ing , loos·es v. tr. 1. To let loose; release: loosed the dogs. 2. To make loose; undo: loosed his belt. 3. To cast loose; detach: hikers loosing their packs at camp. 4. To let fly; discharge: loosed an arrow. 5. To release pressure or obligation from; absolve: loosed her from the responsibility. 6. To make less strict; relax: a leader's strong authority that was loosed by easy times.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Not one example of loosing there m8y. loosed yes, past tense and all. loosing no, not one of 'em Loosing is an old Jewish word. Nought to do with tarding.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Quite right. Loosing isn't grammer though. It's just TOTALLY the wrong word. That's why no-one on forums lose, because they don't know they are, they are looking out for looses. All by the by though and good banter Pictures of cats - yes I'd like to see those.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
[pedant]It's the gerund of loose[/pedant]

Of course. It's all b0110cks But you also know that it's all so wrong that it's right. This is the internet: everyone's a winner.

Ok here you go. Attached Image (click to enlarge) My strategy (courtesy my dad) revolves all around our cat. I call it "The Eye of the Tiger". Everytime my "indicators" give me a signal, I show the charts to my cat. If he looks at it with interest then I get the final confirmation and I pull the trigger, if he looks away, then I walk away no matter how good the setup looks. Yes thats the discipline. Its all about the discipline you see. Works 9 out of 10 times. Also the 1 time it doesnt work, I get to blame the cat, so all good.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Is the bell part of the alert system? Can we get this coded in to the EA?

Using divergence as a leading indicator. it's extremely powerful

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Yes thank you very much. All the trading books I have read and the forums I have lurked kept saying that I need to find my "edge". Without that, even if I sit next to the best trader in the world and follow his/her trades, my trade will still magically end up in the red because I do not have their edge. I have finally found my edge now. Thank you Eye of the Tiger. I know now where the price is headed next. Ahem...It is basically any area where it does a reversal from, not necessarily the next plotted support and resistance.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
That's correct

OK, we haven't talked about psychology yet. Let's get back to basics. If this was the first bar of all time. Attached Image The market needs psychology to move. Without psychology there would be no market......oh, and discipline of course but we'll get onto kinky pictures later. For now psychology, although Freud would no doubt already be perusing the rubber boot erection of the catalogue. So, this was the first bar of all time. What was the psychology?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Price went down, so I suppose the next time price hits the open price of this candle, there'll be sellers coming to join the bandwagon. It was a good time to sell then, it must be a good time to sell now!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I see that, but that's logic; is the open of a random time slice in the past of any significance ? Also, are you talking about what you'd do on the next bar (I'm not sure)? Sorry the market no longer existed. What would you do on THIS bar. What about psychology: fear and greed move the market I've been told - without psychology the market won't move irrespective of a deluge of orders being dumped by a central bank.

Hey, WOWIZOWI. This bu11sh1t indicator I made up TELLS you where to draw squares With the added power of cats you just can't win.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I added my market profile indicator to answer your question. Both the market and psychology involve people (according to Google), so there must be some kind of a connection. It checks all price levels with 0.00001 precision (too bad I don't have level IIII tick data), between each candle's high and low, and draws horizontal lines to mark the activity at the specific price levels. There are also some hidden settings of the indicator I'm not at liberty to divulge - anyway, the lines turned out completely Tomato red indeed, so my conclusion is, there were only sellers in the market during that time, no buyers.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Who did they sell to?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Bombay Trader's cat

--- 帖子 #118 ---
The answer is so magical and mysterious I can't comprehend it myself.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I know you can't supply the secret code for the EA but if you could code it so the straight lines can be rolled up into balls like wool and then supply a locked code block we can add it into the cat code. Although I still don't know if that covers the psychology angle - it says they wanted to sell at all of those lines but it doesn't tell us their motivation or if they enjoyed it, if it gave pleasure, love, hope, succor....I don't know?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
When you find the edge you have to be careful not to fall off it. That's what makes a pro.......high vis jacket and tin foil helmet also required. Many pro traders edge is the act of forum trading, which is much more profitable and far more lucrative than trying to trade a synthetic market for pennies with a bucket shop: this is why it's secret and proprietory and no EA exists: idiocy cannot be coded. All are welcome in the private group.

But the lines are in very specific places, and I can't be @rsed to draw all of them. You have to learn to think for yourself.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
The chart to which you refer has 3 white lines. At some point price is no longer cheap enough to buy and at some point it is no longer too expensive to sell.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
yeah I noticed this a while ago, price goes up, and price goes down.... buy when its going up and sell when it's going down, you got a 50/50 if you get that bit wrong anyway.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I've very glad you chose 7 pips. 7 is a very auspicious number. There are the obvious connections: The seven deadly sins, which all good traders should aspire to. Then there is the Magnificent Seven, a thinly-guised plot which many thought was about a small mexican village being pillaged every year by an evil bandit. But anybody with an ounce of imagination could see the small Mexican village was in fact "the Market", Calvera was the epitomy of brokers, and then of course there was Yul Brynner who is not dissimilar to Bombay Trader's cat. Snow White - she made sure she had 7 dwarves (not 6, not 8). Three wise men... what did they ride on? Camels. One each. That makes a total of 6. Plus I think there was a cat in there somewhere too. That'll make 7. The connections to 7 are uncanny. As a result, I always split my trades into 7 smaller trades and then place them in quick succession. But I'm only allowed to press the button with my right thumb. Otherwise the trade doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Your numerology skills do you proud and I see you possess great wisdom - even more so as the market to which you refer was stolen from the Japanese which brings us back to Stale Wind... Everything is circular, including trend lines.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Oh, I forgot to mention. When utitilising Stale Wind you have to be VERY wary of Dark Cloud Cover.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Have they asked for it back?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Very true, well spotted, but also of note is it has to go down before it can go up and go up before it can go down. Then you buy when it's going up and sell when it's going down. it's so simple when you think about it

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I want to contribute if you let me. I want give to all in the community a useful indicator to catch the big moves. I gave him the name of STS. (Snoopy Trading System) And along with your strategy I think we found the holy grail. Very easy to follow, sell on red color buy on green color. Properties of the indicators are by default. I will remove the indicator soon, so hurry up to download. * Any questions feel free to ask PS: All what I have learned was with a Ex-Institutional trader, with a very good reputation, although anonymous (he´s very humble). And yes just like me he have dogs, and like me he goes to the gym too. Well, sooner or latter I will create a website too. And remember guys it´s all for FREE!! (for now)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
yep, so thats all anyone needs to know and then don't piss your pants once you have bought or sold and don't cry like a big girls blouse if you lose.

If you are wrong about direction more than 50% of the time stop trying to guess direction, keep trading in the same direction until you have a clue what you're doing. You'll trade less and you'll make less mistakes. The market goes up or down from where in which direction and how far is pure educated guessing. Make your complete cluelessness work in your favour. That's what the banks do, along with the 50, 100 and 200 MAs of course which don't correlate with anything because they're old stock market numbers from a looooonnnnnnnnggggg time ago and may just only apply when looking at a certain chart and not others (doh!) 286 might be the more accurate magic number for the XXX

You get what you give I seem to remember it saying in a self help book I downloaded of P1rateB@y, which was cribbed from my favourite book, the Bible, which I half inched from a budget motorway-side hotel once. I love how they do that: take something totally out of context and bend it to suit our base, greedy, self serving desires. Of COURSE it equates all the riches of the kingdom of heaven with $$$, what else could it mean?? So, it says in the bible that the more we give, the more we will receive in $$$. So I'm ALL about giving. So, I now want to set THE Gold standard in teaching Teh XxXX with my method.

And don't give me any of that 'didn't trigger nonsense', ever heard of bid and ask not being the same price? So to recap, traders entering using magic bars on H1 or shorter got whipped. If they then re-entered they may have won a pittance, or the 'wise' ones have just had their break even stops triggered. Now the H4 magic bar blunderers are being taken for a ride too. If you place a stop loss it means that's where you want to be stopped out. So if you're placing your stop loss at stupid levels... Geddit?

Short Attached Image (click to enlarge) Last night I had a very lengthy conversation with someone about a pair. He has spent literally 2 years seeing 'things' and developing a method that's so convoluted and complicated that I simply can't fathom it, and neither can anyone else. It's SO simple he says...and yet he just can't explain it to anyone, he draws, he writes and yet no-one understands....because he can't write in coherent sentences and his method of drawing changes every damn time . It's nothing spectacular though, just TA and making drawings. The thing is even though, he says it's all the same thing and yet, every time he presents it, it's completely different. Ring a bell?? He is incredibly successful, online, just like the rest of us. He's in the 5%, like we all are. And he's a GREAT teacher. His call, after MUCH drawing on the 5 minute chart with little of anything else supporting it apart from a fibo was to go short on a certain currency. Why? I asked when, if you look slightly, just slightly, further down the chart to what had more recently occured and used exactly the same rules, then it was going up and not down. He'd just decided it was going down and ignored all other factors, so any further drawings didn't matter, because he hadn't drawn them. His call was short at a certain price area. Needless to say, price has shot straight through that area by 40 pips...he calls himself a scalper! No doubt the result chart will not be shown or discussed, or there will be a magical reason based on some PA phenomenon as yet unforetold as to why he didn't enter on that one

You fell asleep at 3AM arghhh! Then you found the ideal 'setup' hit the trigger button with your tight stop and 1% risk and...lost 1%, and then lost 1% again, and then won 0.5% and then lost 1% and then won 2% and then lost 1% and lost 1% and lost 1% and then, here it comes it's up 4% I'll move my stop to b/e and let it ride and won 0%. No, not really, of course, like the 95% you actually won 30%......what? A 30% reduction in life? Wasn't work easier??? And more profitable??? And more fun???

The line from last night and where was an entry? Too much Attached Image (click to enlarge) Of course the downward magic bar may be of some concern but there again...not really. Did I get up at 5 am to watch the market? No. Was I sitting here waiting for a perfectly timed, perfect entry? Err..no! Did I enter at the line? No What did you do? Well I got up, saw the time and knew that London was open. I went for a pee and scratched my balls then went downstairs and drank a pint and a half of water. Then I opened the lid on my laptop, re-entered the password on my terminal and had a quick look. Yeah, its wicked the line, long it is then. Worked out size, position on, now for some food and some more bodily eliminations: you know..LIFE I'll check it in a while. Only of concern with this run since the bottom is that the pullbacks to buying areas have been relatively shallow and there's only been 2 so far: there hasn't been much chance to size up. The run may only end in a small profit this time.

Looking good The other thing: know where you'd want to be long from &amp; determine if your price is too cheap to sell. Market is always stuck in a range somewhere, you just need to find one big enough to trade. The other thing - I'd want to see the basis for the formation of that supply you drew - those indys can be sketchy - needs to have fallen from there like a stone, pref smashing through some supply levels on the way down BAM but that along with the subsequent action you've drawn, looks like it's going down doesn't it?

Thanks, I timed my entry from M15 supply levels. Maybe thats too noisy. First arrow was my entry @ touch of the level and it got stopped a couple of pips above the zone, in hindsight the level was mwah. Second arrow hit the target and made for the first trade too.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Stale Wind bending time allows us to make sense of the market Unfortunately, as Stale Wind is still based on broker bullshit bars it isn't 100%. H4 charts are just a quick shorthand to prevent thinking. On H4 look for combinations, blocks of things make it easier for our tiny minds to comprehend. On my EU charts, shows a clear failure of just relying on H4 charts: combined H4 longs had not been overcome on my charts - the last move up was only singular, which is where it unfortunately becomes art and not mechanical. It becomes apparent when dropping to H1 what is happening re broken demand.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
P rice is too cheap to sell @ 1.3575. For now. Next up 1.355 But that off course is just a guess.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
It's all guessing - 'about here' is about as close as you can get. What will make your call even more valid is a minimum of, say, 1 H4 bar closing up but price still remaining below your level. Because this tells you...what??? So you've got time to chill No need to sit watching the screen because if price comes back within one H4 bar there's a good chance of what??? But you've now got pips in hand, worst that can possibly happen is you lose your initial R. No caring No FEAR

Do you check multiple pairs? In the smaller time frames pairs move different. But because we're trading zones here, not time frames, it shouldn't really matter right?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I tend to not bothered with much below M15: that's more to see b/o zones for H1 and more likely to be when looking @ re-entry areas. Draw a line 'about here'. Re: mechanical and combining bars, you can be mechanical up to a point. If purely mechanical on my charts I'd have missed the EU move you traded: not a big deal. This is not a precise day trading or scalping method with close stops and 95% probability of going bust, more like 75% but those are better odds aren't they? Entries are 'about here' but of course, some things are observed to build a hypothesis. Note I'm now starting to use big words to make myself appear knowledgeable. This is one step further in my ploy to dupe some newbies. The blocks, or b0110cks as I prefer to call them are a means of measuring momentum: variable rather than fixed rate sampling. Bends Time With Stale Wind Sometimes, when blocking H4 the results are different if price is not moving much. On the example chart my last green 'up' block does not exist on the H4 chart. If you watch the H4 and price is in an area of potential supply or demand you may sometimes need to drop to H1 for a clearer picture........although sometimes it can confuse as much as clarify! But...if you have it wrong, your stop is where? 7 pips away...no, no, no, no, no. I'm being serious for once. In your example, H1 shows the break of 1 H1 demand zone (ok), then sharp momentum down (good) which pierces the next H1 demand zone too (2xH1 demand zones, hey that might be something of relevance), there's a reaction back to new supply with less momentum up than down - so price is going down. The day chart: 3 factors saying the daily supply zone may be a good one 1. Amount travelled from the area, 2. How quickly it left the area: hmm, not that quickly on daily, check H4 but also LOOK at the run of daily bars straight down, no pause. 3. It went straight through the lower level before eventually returning to supply All the above is just developing a shorthand for 'sell about here'.

OK. A little about reality again. Compound interest. Trade explorers. £000% gains b0110cks TINY accounts If I scalp I can sit at my screen 24/7, have no life at all and make a fortune....NO YOU WON'T, you'll go bust and make your broker a fortune. You're sat there labouring away under the pretense that you are working hard and as we all know you have to work hard for your money. And don't show me a ridiculous spreadsheet showing what you could make in theory with your daft gains, timing the market to a pip. bu11sh1t Reality check, with a ridiculous, but realistic compound interest calculation. I've just shown you 2 real trade sequences that have netted...what was it, trade 1 was 8U? (make it 6 then), trade 2, so far is at 4U?? I think. Let's subtract losers, say I lost 4U per week on average, and that is HIGH. So that's 6U (6 friggin' U profit per week and that's with seriously downgrading numbers) for doing next to nothing. That's 6U per week back into the pot, compounding. Even if you only use 0.5% per U, that's 3% per week compounding. If your account to start is only a lousy £10,000 That is £36,000 in year 1. That's too slow?? Not enough money for you? Well look at the numbers again, does that seem realistic? GREED is your problem my friend. Or continue risking 1% on a 7 pips stop (instantly giving 0.5% to your broker even if you win the trade!) and then losing losing losing anyway.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Provided you have a hypothesis in place, the logical place for a stop-loss order would be at the opposite side of the supply/demand zone. If your hypothesis is correct, then the market shouldn't go there. If it goes there, then you've got something wrong. However, that's just another hypothesis. Maybe I've got something wrong. How do you put a stop order on a forum?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Yeah - the daily zone, not the newly formed hourly one, put it there and you're asking for trouble. Put your stop where price has already proven where it does not want to be, out of harms way, outside of the current range.

Post 201 - purely discretionary. Trade 1 was 1R risk. Trade 2 was 1R risk still with 1R injected into the stop i.e. stop was in the same place: same position size (why this and why not increase size - shallow pullback meant it wasn't really optimum to do it). Trade 3 was still 1R risk with the stop moved nearer the market i.e. position size increased

That's a matter of personal preference I think. Home runs or steady profits, they can both work. Yes, you need to take profit at some point. Whether you take 20 times 50 pips on average, 5 times 200 pips on average or a single 1000 pips, it's the same. I guess it boils down to which is "easier" for you. Which style suits you better. Taking the small profits might be slightly easier as you can do it on any market conditions, while you can't take 1000 pips if the market doesn't move 1000 pips in one direction.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
You need an idea of when to exit. If you do not price will usually come back and bite you. It is more usual for price to retrace than to move 140 pips in one direction without pause. Buying back when cheaper requires a different mindset to 'punt and hold'. Hence 2 more badges towards 'guru' status - I present it to you as blanket fact with no proof to back it up whatsoever. The email list is building nicely. All are welcome What happened if you did not take profit on EU??? In that instance did I call the stall point almost to the pip (my haven't I got big b0110cks, of course it was luck!!! Of course it could have gone further)? How much of your potential for re-investment are you willing to give back in the name of greed when you are still small, when you should be re-investing in safety (your stop)? It is far far more difficult on single punts to win more 'pips' than you lose. Low win rate and constant stop outs will destroy most traders. Be greedy when you are large and able to re-invest in your position size, not when you are small. Because it's your job to be small when wrong and large when right but keeping risk constant. This is what gives you R:R, not just the simple notion of 'winning more pips than you lose'. But that helps too of course Risk 1, win 5-8 over and over but when the market has only moved 4. It's very very simple but a little more sophisticated than the tosser Van Tharp. Tosser of coins of course Take out the fear, take your profit if it is enough and re-invest when you get the chance. 100 pips off one entry wasn't enough yesterday? Market went 140? Did you know that before it happened? Coulda shoulda woulda? If your mechanism for getting out is not a trailing stop (by God it isn't!) then you get out when price is stalling or you have just had a huge move in your favour. Of interest to the EU short traders but only if you have already made profit, taken profit and can now re-invest profit.

It's much more than outstanding. Realistically even 50% per year is OUTSTANDING. Plus, if you are trading larger amounts and need to split your orders, with an 'about here' approach you can.

Woah there, forget to check the cats Attached Image (click to enlarge) They're not in agreement, may be too early to short. When does the H4 up magic bar finish? Maybe wait for that to close and then go short on the next one down

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Yeah, may as well add some random, arbitrarily calculated lines which are calculated from random price points from arbitrary random magic bars: bound to work. Can someone add them to the EA please?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
No as it's of no significance apart from what you put on it. Bank of Japan: Better get ready to buy some dollars - it's at the monthly pivot Bank of England: sell CHF - it's at the 33% fib what I have drawn here The Fed: Time to dump some currency - the 50 MA has crossed teh 100 MA , oh...hang on a bit, it's above the 200 still and it's pointing up, no then...BUY BUY BUY The Canadians: We don't understand this game??? So we buy when it's at the random line but sell when it's below the random calculated line but only if the random line we drew from a random point is at another random number and.......????? How are we to know when to buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
The bu11sh1t indicator isn't RSI, if you care to look past the end of your proboscis it was first derived from CCI, not RSI, making it doubly useless. Now, it's a special indicator made with magic number derived from RSI and I change it when I feel like it and the cats NEVER lie: and to boot, I'm only using them because one of the other experts told me to if you take a moment to check back... They're always out to screw you over. And, drawing lines, yeah, why not? They have as much bearing on things as anything else. Your magic pivots are only calculated from magic random data points and mean about as much as anything else i.e. zero: re-iterating, all they are are extrapolations of a mid point of 2 completely RANDOM data points i.e. they're a moving average HL/2 + extensions. Even though RSI is still complete bullsh1t, at least on a short setting of 3 it's telling you something completely obvious and of no use whatsoever - if price is above or below the previous close w.r.t its last random data sample. Something you can see by looking at the magic bars anyway. It's completely useless, pointless and redundant, so you can read whatever mysteries into it you so wish. But at least it uses 1 data point only, so you can see if price is moving up from it or down from it. Now look at pivots. It's above one line but below the other...so is price going up or down? Oh, one line arbitrarily has R1 written on it so you're going to use that as a presumption that price will go down from it? Unless price breaks through it and then obviously it's going up....but then there's a line above that says R2 so it must still be going down from that one right?? They have NO predictive power whatsoever. Only a complete fool would draw more than one line, one point of reference.......which is why I'm drawing LOADS of them. Your pivots: they're complete bu11sh1t m8, which is why I want them in the EA.

Firstly..... is "Owl" related to you is some way ? Not sure why I asked that. Those magic random numbers look like this on a chart. Fairly convincing to me (at times). When you release your magic cat indicator to the public I'm sure you'll make a bundle though How much do you plan to charge ?

I'm going to have to hammer this home. 95% FAIL Why are you believing what some numpty tells you on an internet forum? What 'works' for them or for you you on a forum Does not 'work' for reality. Stop lying to yourself and to everyone else. The stats do not agree with you and you cannot argue them away with pretty pictures of magical indicators, bars, lines, mystic runes or anything else. The market is tearing you a new hole, if not right now at this moment, it will do soon. Or are you one of the 'special' ones? Why are XXXX scams so prevalent? Because it is EASY to screw over someone who may not even be particularly gullible but is so DESPERATE to believe in the fairy tale that they'll just about go along with ANYTHING.

Hello Nunrgguy, I am not familure with the large red, green candels with no wicks that I see on some of your charts. Could you give a explanation and how you use them. from reading the thread so far, I am guessing that they are related to over bought or over sold ?? Thanks

You're referring to Stale Wind. Bend Time With Stale Wind. Must get the terminology correct. Overbought and oversold - not even close. Have another look

--- 帖子 #284 ---
You beat me - I've changed my post to be more helful. Corp Charts have an 8MA - I haven't got a frggin' clue m8, have they? You're getting closer with the squares. Its a measure of continuous trending activity, and I use the term trending loosely - "strength of candle": no, strength of move: yes. Where is it likely that traders went long or short from? There are no magic timeframes, no magic bar formations, Bend Time With Stale Wind gives a better visualisation of how the market is moving when all we have to work with is a fix sampled digital representation of an analogue entity. Fixed sampling + smoothing is no good if you want to see momentum. There are no timeframes, they do not exist, price is where price is on any chart. The fixed data compression showing past movement means...not a lot

So do we consider long EU on the retrace/stop stealing because the mocaine induced rally has short squeezed most of ff and for those now in profit who are p!ssing themselves and moving stops to break even are about to lose everything?

Depends on your outlook. No real momentum to position off the high yet. If you're looking at something provided by an indicator it's an old level that has potential. I'd sniff something very wiffy down first.

Long on retrace to the arrow. I dont want to look at anything below h1 cause i dont have the life to waste on shorter timeframes, and i believe u were showing the m1 charts just to demonstrate the lower timeframe bollocks.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I was mainly. If you're looking for break/retrace levels of a certain size with close stops to m1: stale wind on M1 equates to magic bars on M3-M5 ish, it gets very silly very quickly. And then all of that effort and hours of living wasted to get spiked out in an instant. Oh you got a winner? Looks like a massive move on that chart, measure it - 11 pips less spread So unless there's some insane leveraging going on Near term I might look at m5 but only to mark out levels when I'm waiting for them to be broken if trading from something apparent on M30-ish, which equates sometimes to magic candles on H1.

There were pips to be made from that line but between being stopped out or not entering or not taking profit could have I? at this stage no, cause i didnt. What would be a good way to approach next week? Should i have a shallow watch list of pairs like 4-5 so I dont go crazy and just look for htf 'somethings' that price is currently close to that could cause reaction next week? If that is a yes then I will take that as step one, and we will go with that for next week and I will post to the thread what I see.

Something that will help you become profitable: After you've won around 0.2% on a trade, immediately post it on a forum to show your success.

You have to have 2 views of the market. And they are completely opposite in logic. You have to believe something will continue to hold from one POV You have to believe that exact same thing will not continue to hold from another POV Then you have to watch the market to see which is correct.

Hey look, nearly 70% on FF have been short cable all week Attached Image (click to enlarge) I see long trades off the lows every single day this week From the highs? You do know that 'confirmed' resistance gets weaker ever time it is hit, NOT stronger. You do know that every move starts on the tick chart, not on the monthly chart? Say again? You're looking at it backwards. Any move starts on the tick chart. You see a magic H4 bar and then enter. Congratulations - you're going short because the market went short 4 hours ago.

Price moves between all levels until all participants are wiped out. That's what the market it does. It moves from size to size, in the meantime, smaller size must be assimilated. Know where size is.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Maybe - if you got caught short and it went long to the upper level there's no guarantee it's going to come back - that's the same kind of thinking you should be using when you enter: WHO got caught going the wrong way??? Everyone expects price to be resisted at a small near term level...to have a hope of being successful you have to try to think what everyone else thinks in the near term then presume the absolute opposite and then wait for price to show you the truth. The large level is just a potential level, nothing more (what does it look like on the weekly or monthly chart?) - it's not fresh now having been hit 3 times already - price can go way beyond it even if it is going to come down - see the pin then went all the way through before? A level is only valid once near term PA says it is....ALL moves begin on the tick chart. You choose your price areas from large charts and you make your entry decisions from small charts BUT you are still trading the large charts. So many do it @rse about face and then come out with cr@p like 'supply and demand doesn't work'....yeah, because you don't know what you're doing You need to be able to be able to manage 2 concepts at the same time. 1. Supply/demand is going to hold 2. Supply demand is going to break Supply and demand doesn't work.....think THAT one over...what a load of b0ll0cks. The entire market runs on supply and demand so I guess the market is broken then.... Oh It IS Wishing for price to come back is a gamble pure and simple but it MAY at least back down to the breakout level...caveat being it's the weekend etc etc Good luck.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Good points, thanks for your time-- question- I would like to understand this supply demand thing better - from all that I have read on it so far - seems confusing and it seems that some call pivot points supply demand and or support and resistiance levels, seem to be interchanged, so I have been confused about this.... Do you have any good souce for me to read up on it? well the pain is a little less and Im still on oxigen and the presure gauge is getting low... lets see how the week turns out.

Some much needed additions to the bu11sh1t template

--- 帖子 #400 ---
S/D levels and S/R are similar but not quite the same and they're not the same in their usage. S/R levels are generally drawn from extremes of market turning points. The more times a level is hit the stronger it is thought to be. Now stick a fractal indicator on your chart and sh1t yourself S/D levels - CAN be at pivots but can also be mid-trend. There are 3 things defining a level 1. Time at the level 2a. How fast price left the level 2b. How much continuous momentum from the level 3. Momentum broke through a perceived support/resistance level Plus one more point of logic, which is this: the times price returns to the level the WEAKER it gets, why? Because the assumption is that if there were N orders at the level, each time price returns, a certain amount get filled: obviously this is more relevant to nearer term levels. It is unlikely that the theory hold when viewing a level on the monthly chart from 3 years ago BUT there are other reasons then why price MAY react to the level (fundamental). Also good to note: say you see a large momentum breakout on the H1 chart and price moves 80 pips in 4 hours. Price then meanders back down to the level over a period of 8 hours. What does that tell you? Attached Image (click to enlarge) You draw your lines, have an idea then trade that idea Attached Image (click to enlarge) These are just for noting levels Attached Image (click to enlarge) The entry you do the complete opposite...or maybe you don't, maybe the logic is exactly the same but just happening a whole lot quicker? Momentum breaks something and price returns somewhere?? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Look for large continuous movements breaking out from 'somewhere' See a large bar from a swing high - look to a smaller chart to see the breakout area Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #401 ---
If it was you? That said you were using the supply demand indicator I recommend you do not use it - it will confuse the hell out of you as it draws levels here, there and everywhere, especially at the newest swing high/low when price is just retracing back to the level you intend to trade from - it will have you constantly going the wrong way in a 'trending' market. To get a better feel for things try trading between levels using stale wind on H1 or M30 and then M5 for entry. Always ensure there is enough space between levels. Look at Mondays disaster for most people for an example of when to stay out. Do not try to trade breakouts. That isn't the idea. The idea is to take the money off the people that took the breakout. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Remember I was saying short 2 weeks ago when most were long? Attached Image (click to enlarge) but last week was going long....because even though overall I'm still thinking short, there was enough potential to the upside to do it. Back to the mess. Why?? And why to stay out?

That means Stale Wind on the daily and above: weekly supply and demand levels. You look for something told hold: what? And you look for something to fold: what? And even then you can STILL refine it down to shorter timeframes: You think you're going to enter once with that strategy and then hold a 1U punt for 3-4-5 weeks? And move your stop about like a mug.....and get gapped at the weekend and generally screwed over? Or will price bob up and down on its way from demand to supply? In which case you can?????

OK, that brings us into 2 dimensions.

you make some valid points, but don't forget we all over estimate our own abilities. You make a statement here about being long and short the same market and holding indefinitely, sure your short term trades of current supply and demand levels is a valid approach, but it will never come close to making the exponential profits I have seen from position trading using the approach you disagree with. The key is knowing how to diversify your position to trade short, medium and long term all at the same time. So, don't fall into the trap of believing everything you feel, we all are almost never as good as we believe. also... risk to reward myth, well you need to be more specific, but as you like trading based off what has happened in the past, according to past results, higher the risk reward ratio more profit, of course you need to move out of the box of 1/2 1/3 and look much more towards 1/10 1/20... but as you know, that's bast on something that may never happen again... uncertain and all that good luck....

Being long and short the same market makes no profits and is not position trading. You have no idea what I'm talking about apparently because I am advocating position trading . There are other definitions to position trading than ''holding forever' and 'oops I've haven't got enough margin in my account to trade this fantasy' Talking of exponential profits when we are in the world of retail where nearly all fail is pure fantasy. Stop peddling nonsense. Exponential profits come from compounding. 'This method makes more money than that method' Most don't make ANY money with any method for any meaningful period of time. It's pure conjecture. Trying to get 1/10 etc - I think I showed a live trade only last week that did around that. What's the problem? What did my idiot trade on 5 min this morning do? 4:1 ish, would've been 5:1 if I'd TP when hitting the level rather than seeing if it would go further? Why did it start going the other way? Oh yeah big supply level, nope, lets move out stop to breakeven and hope - oops only it wiped us out for nothing almost immediately Giving us a negative R:R negative? Yes we foolishly risked 1% OF OUR CAPITAL to gain 0. = -infinity% R:R So what? 5:1. 8:1 it's bo110cks 1 punt in with 1% of your account, hold and hope it goes through all those market levels. Exponential gains come from risking as little of your capital as possible, getting your lot size up, maxing your leverage out and kicking the market in the b0110cks with its own money. Followed by compounding over time.

Think man, think. How do you get your lotsize up, max out your leverage and yet still only risk 1% of your capital? How do you do it?

We don't like having our cosy view challenged do we? I'm just the same. If that's where someone is presently with their understanding, fair do's. Just don't go pretending to be yet another GURU. Don't think I'm trading what happened in the past. The past just shows potential price levels..... Did an H4 engulfing bar happen in the present? Or did it happen 4 hours ago Ever wonder how sometimes the market rises from the low on your 4 hour chart but....there's no engulfing bar. How can this be possible?? Feckin Magic Bars. GIVE ME STRENGTH! The only thing the pages of Nison are good for is wiping your arris on. Note, yet again for the fekin stupid: I am only showing 5 minute trades LIVE so something can be shown. Not 'this would have happened if I entered here and held for 12 million pips'. Also: for the fekin stupid. Consider this: PROBABILITIES Also: for the fekin stupid: I advocate having a plan: a plan is not 'enter here, exit here' a plan is having a map of the market based on a hypothesis of how the market moves, then trading it on the basis of what is happening NOW. If the market does this I will do...??? If the market does this I will then??? I will know when it is prudent to enter given risk parameters, I will know when it is prudent to hold, I will know when it is prudent to get out. I advocate proper positioning I advocate safety I advocate minimal risk I advocate getting your lot size up until you get a migraine I advocate extracting more 'pips' from the market than apparent pips movement I advocate trading the large chart from the small chart I advocate trading between 2 levels, ON THE LARGE CHART but watching the trade develop on the smaller chart and knowing what to do if it doesn't go to plan I advocate knowing what the heck you are doing if you are going to trade very small charts: hey bullish engulfing hourly candle above the daily open, let's trade the breakout of the high straight into supply at London Close when price has already done its daily range....bound to work with 1% of my hard earned capital placed at risk exactly where they're likely to take the market to ..

I haven't got 12000 the wife won't let me have it. It all gets p1ssed up the wall on shoes, handbags and adding another 6 inches to her arris with chocolate.

The plan can be to a max out leverage and then hold for the big win etc. Space management is a head trick all stolen from someone else, also stolen from someone else by someone else who tries to sell it as a course. What a surprise It's exactly what sh1t for brains was spouting about : holding off on short term gratification to make large gains. It is, however, not about making random entries off H4 bars, holding and hoping for 10:1 R:R. You can keep hitting 10:1 outliers? Why aren't you doing it at max leverage? You split the trade account into risk and capital. The majority is kept in capital, always, which is required to fund margin: this is why 'enter 30 trades and hold forever' is nonsense. Margin requirement?? Or are you an over-leveraged fool using more than 20:1? Probabilities. The probability of hitting a number of trades that make smaller R multiples is MUCH higher than those making large R multiples. Teh XXX is predominantly a range market designed to f'k over all participants - see H4 chart I posted and say it ain't so...then go learn some more about WHY and how those pretty bars are forming and why and how they have wicks that go to certain places and why sometimes one makes an engulf and why sometimes it looks completely different. It's actually all written somewhere already in the load of old b0ll0cks called THIS THREAD A trade is not a trade What??? A trade is not a trade. It is but one part of a trade sequence, which is a trade. The first trade in a trading sequence is the one which carries the largest risk and the smallest reward. Whereas the last trade is the one with the smallest risk and the largest reward. E.G. You wish to risk 1% of YOUR hard earned money. On trade 1 of a sequence you are risking 1% of YOUR money. If you only view trades as risking X% of your entire balance this is BAD, because you are always risking YOUR own money. You are constantly seeking short term gratification by immediately putting the proceeds of winning trades into the 'mine' side of the ledger and giving yourself a nice slap on the back and a huge mental and financial handicap in the process. Rather you should be patient and leave the money with the market. The winnings belong to the market and in the risk side of the ledger until YOU decide YOUR goal has been met. It is much easier to put money that is not yours at risk. Is trading OPM not part of the HOLY GRAIL? Kick the market in the b0ll0cks with its own money! It deserves it. If you constantly put the winnings in the MINE side of the ledger, every time you lose, you lose 1% of YOUR money. This is BAD BAD BAD. You are constantly putting your capital at risk (bear with this!), it is BAD for your confidence, BAD for your account health and BAD for growth potential. You know based on past performance that you have a good win rate with your trading method and the probability is reasonable that you can get a run of 4 to 5 winning trade entries: this is on the basis of a stop placed fairly close to your entry....would it be higher still if the stop was placed further away? (But that's inverse R:R, sacrilege!) Now, assuming trade 1 goes somewhere near target - lets say it was today's 5 minute trade I showed which took 4R. OK let's say it made 3R. I now have my risk R + 3R of the market's money to play with. With this additional 3R I have choices - I can size and position for safety, moving my stop further away or I can size for aggression by increasing lot size. OK, the market is ranging presently and I need to increase my lot size before thinking of anything else - I go for safety. Going for safety I can keep the same entry risk of 1% and move my stop further away from the market - I have an idea where I wouldn't like price to go but I can to some extent mitigate against getting hit with a news spike etc. If it goes totally wrong I still only lose 1% of MY money. i.e. I am injecting winnings into my stop. As my stop is further from the market I can make better decisions re exiting the market before my stop is hit if the trade goes against me. I never physically move my stop, not ever. So trade 2: much less stress this time: same entry method etc but as I made 3R I've chosen to invest 2R realised into my stop and 1R realised into my position size. etc etc etc More on the example: After two or 3 trades I can, if I so wish, at the expense of larger size, take the 1% initial risk of my own money out of the risk side of the account and be trading purely with the market's money. Then, even if I lose it all, I will not lose a penny of my capital. So, I can continue trading for safety, OR I can use realised profits to inject into my position size and max out my leverage. Whatever I elect to do I am STILL only risking 1% of my capital. I can only increase size until I hit the maximum margin requirement on the account and am maxed out on leverage. That is ultimately the goal. Then and only then is when I consider holding for fantasy trades that go to 6-7-8-10 R. I can't trade any larger size, so now is the time to try to attain maximum pips. If it goes wrong and the entire position is wiped out I still only lose 1% of capital (unless I removed it from the equation prior, in which case I lose nothing) If it goes right a large number has been added to the account. If I'm not electing to go for those fantasy trades I have other rules in place for example: everything on the risk side goes back into the capital side on a weekly basis or I realise profits after N trades etc. If on the other hand the sequence was not successful, depending on how managed, if the 1% capital was lost then obviously another 1% of capital has to be utilised...but if money remains on the risk side of the ledger, that can be re-sized and re-utilised for another trade sequence. How and when money moves from one side of the ledger to the other is purely down to YOU. Shorter term trades with small size leading to longer term trades with large size. Holding off on gratification today for larger rewards tomorrow. WHAT is YOUR plan for the trade WHAT is YOUR risk management plan for the trade WHAT is YOUR trade management plan for the trade Or just keep punting H4 magic bars under the illusion you're holding off on gratification, when you're doing the total opposite. YOUR hard earned capital going (what's the probability on 10R punts? 20%? less?): -1%, -1%, -1%, -1%, -1%, -1%, lets be kind, +5%, -1%, -1%, 0, -1%, -1%, -1%, -1%, -1%, 0, +3%, +10%, -1%, -1%, 0, -1% etc. Can you see how this is going to kill your confidence? Can you see that you can read as much about psychology and discipline as you like but if you don't play tricks with your mind you're going to destroy yourself. Your margin is reducing and your mind will NOT allow you to hold for mythical 10R trades because you've got to win some money SOME time etc etc. You are not superhuman. Losing YOUR money hurts. it hurts a LOT. Going back to the pros. If a desk trader at CME has a bunch of orders to put through.......oh no....that's nothing to do with risking 1% and getting 10% in one go. 10:1 R:R Now that IS greed and that IS short term-ism. Your magical engulf looks like something on the M5 or M15 chart if you care to look. Just have a quick look, it won't kill you. In the interest of balance: Its all total b0ll0cks

The fantasy of putting on many positions , moving a stop to breakeven and then holding forever with no idea of when to exit With a 20% win rate and trading multiple markets at the same time How many positions do you think you're going to get on before you run out of margin? I could explain but most of it is in the thread anyway Then you say it is reckless for doing the safest thing possible and looking for safety of capital before profit. And to do so would mean blowing up, when in fact, when you lose....you lose 1R I suggest reading some more Elder and Van Tharp Those who have ears The rest become gurus Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #514 ---
So this week are u going to stay away from watching the tiddler charts? Did u exit with a close above that line or was a stop in place? I believe your stop was well away, so you simply closed because price disrespected your hypothesis short. Do you often take a position and move to another pair if u see something u like? Gain 2R on GU but see something u like on UCAD so transfer to that pair with new hypothesis?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Michael hi! There are a couple of questions for you, where you can specify the native language))

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Correct. I'm not going to be watching 5 minute charts next week. I had enough money in the risk pot to have the stop away, and I mean WELL away, it was Friday and every trade in the week had profited well enough to do that. Going into NFP is madness isn't it? The entry chart is NOT the trade chart. Exit was when the 5 minute candle closed above the line. Price may well have reversed and gone down but you do not think about profiting when you are not in profit. I could have profited from the trade but didn't. I'm not a scalper If the spike had not come back down and closed higher, that is where I would have exited. My stop was not hit and risk funds would remain and be re-sized for the next trade. In this case, on small charts, on NFP Friday, realising profit weekly, that was the end of the sequence, remaining profit going back into capital. If earlier in the week you would re-sizing &amp;/or or moving to a smaller chart: Trading H1/M5 gives no real option but to re-size. Yes you can transfer to another pair if you wish, mid sequence: as long as you have money in the risk fund to do so. YOU build YOUR plan around how much profit you want, or time period over which you trade and then realise profits, if you indeed DID profit back into capital. If trading larger charts it is more reasonable to do it monthly. By definition if realising weekly, you are day trading. If your timeframe is larger can can start with one or two day trades to add to your risk pot then move to the larger charts. Can you 'lose the lot'? Yes, of course. You can trade 'well' for 3 weeks, be over optimistic while increasing lotsize and position too close too the market and lose. In which case, you lose 1R Protect capital, lose small, win big.

"I think something about something (or you, or someone else, or what you have written), and have come to this conclusion therefore" Do you (mis) INTERPRET, look for MEANING when there is none and draw conclusions (which often serves you well, but not in tarding)......or do you OBSERVE, NOTE and ACT on OBSERVATION of WHAT IS? Do you see patterns when there are none? Do you see a 'head and shoulders forming, therefore xyz" or do you just see price going up and down? Do you see a general market drift upwards and interpret this as an uptrend, when in fact falls from swing highs to lows are sharper and deeper than any upward drift? Do you see a big green magic bar and INTERPRET that this is a bullish bar, that this means the market is going up and that the market is trending etc etc Or do you just note that price stopped going down and that from a point of reference in the past, price rose? Which of the two will help your tarding more?

You certainly can go that way yes: be aware of the price levels it has to bust through to get there but there's a target there for sure. There's always 2 directions to play it. Just know which one you're doing when and you'll be OK. OR Choose one way only and always stick with it - see bull and bear charts above. How many up weeks in a downtrend? How many down weeks in an uptrend? If you really want to believe in a concept rather than what is happening, fine, no problem with that, we ALL do to some extent, it's in our nature. See charts above choose a direction to trade and never change it, until you decide otherwise You'll be just as effective doing that as changing your opinion on direction ever other day. Pick one point of reference and trade away from it. What reference? YOU decide, no-one said tarding was easy, it's simple and for idiots but it's definitely not easy. OK for e.g. This years open, last years high etc. Every one of those places on the chart you see where you think 'I'll put my stop there' is likely to be one of those places. Price is always moving away from a point of reference: Some thoughts yeah? MONDAY, price is moving away from the weekly open (breaking out), don't tell me it isn't so where are you positioned from day traders? From the weekly high/low?? Yeah? OK, price went up, price then went back down, below the open and is going down, where are you positioned from day traders? The weekly high?? Or somewhere in no-man's land? So in this example, your reference for up/down is the open and you position from the high or the low??? Is there a trend, remind me again?? Or does price just breakout and when it has finished breaking out, retrace?. If you're looking to trade a retrace where is your price reference? The open? (NO) On the first tick EVER of the market did TREND exist? If traders aim to trade with the trend, how did the market move? Just random stuff for a random market to randomly open some minds a little. You already know all this stuff right? So why aren't you winning???

I'd want to see some indication that levels are going to bust on the way down and a strong push to start it off. Nice magic green bu11sh1t bar up would be nice too Many ways to play it. If you like to risk it with no fresh momentum apparent yet then it's good to short at the high of a high range green bar when it's at the high of its range (yeah I know I'm going 'digital' here) you get a better price but it is a risky play and you have to have a plan for getting out.

Been watching all the sam seiden webinar recordings most of the weekend, Wow now I know what those short horizontal lines indicate on those charts you have been putting up, base levels, and they indicate possable supply or demand levels that we wait for price to come back to. also getting the odds enhancing tid bids down. clearing up a lot of loose ends for me, and my understanding of this concept. Who needs to be buying retail prices, Im going to be a million air now anyone interested - here is a sh1t lode of free vids by sam seiden http://consult-fx.com/26-sam-seiden-webinars

--- 帖子 #569 ---
The videos are OK as a starting point. Some things they don't really go into (because XLT want to screw many $$$$$,000 out of you) Momentum from areas is ALL important. Momentum from areas breaking supply/demand from opposite direction ALL important. This analysis tells you one thing only: that there is potential there. What price does when it gets there is a whole new ball game. MTF - if you expect something to hold, something else has to fold. I'm not going to explain, it should be obvious: look at the H1 charts I showed where I said 'you could do this and nothing else...almost' understand that a break of something apparent on an H1 chart is being looked out for but all moves start on the tick chart, then the 5 minute chart, then the 15 minute chart THEN the H1 chart. YOU have to decide for yourself how much momentum in the present is enough momentum to overcome past momentum:most of the time, even if you are trading reversals, from one time perspective or another you will be trading a breakout. Also, to re-iterate. There is NO system. Every situation is unique because the creation of areas of interest and the smaller areas leading up to them from both sides is unique. Price will usually go in the direction of least resistance. And if you STILL believe in trend: look at your charts again. Aside from that, this coming week I'm going back to the bu11sh1t indicator. I can't stand too many more of these calls that do 200 pips in an afternoon. Sorry 2000 pips in an afternoon

He explained that REAL well. Trade the breakout.......unless you're 'Rat' trading, in which case you do the complete opposite.....buy when it's going down on the daily sell when it's going up, but then you can draw a line on the 5 minute chart and trade the breakout of that. And of course, price MUST pass through the buyzone. 7 pip stop plus spread. Statistical analysis of closed bars from the past is another peach 'Daily candles have a wick of 20 pips or more 2 out of 3 times, that's an edge.....if you have Merlin's time machine' 'Trading is SIMPLE.....when your trade is 3 pips in profit, move your stop to breakeven' 'You could have made profit on that trade, SEE' Yeah, is this on the bid chart or the ask chart btw? I don't think he has ever mentioned that it might work sometimes because he gets his @rse out of bed around London close Good ole PT Barnum I hear he's living in a hut these days.

The line is the same as before, I have not changed it. Hmm, wonder why it's reacting there. Maybe you can also see why I cut for 10 (not drawn) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade the trend Unless of course it's a load of bu11sh1t that doesn't really exist

Missed the E/J dam, and you gave it to use, I was busy with E/U got 14 pips, I noticed that G/U moves a lot the same. does that make you insane.

I cked out the P&amp;F charts, very interesting and never new there was such a thing. still reading up on the use of such charts.

Get used to losing. Tarding is a losing game

quote from nunrgguy, Momentum from areas is ALL important. Momentum from areas breaking supply/demand from opposite direction ALL important. question- I have the basics of the first part but the second part - Is it all important because it would invalidate the first point of momentum move ?

You can go 'countertrend' to the order zone as I've been showing sometimes but till you get the hang of it, go with the 'trend' - i.e. follow the near term momentum. There's at least one short into that but know when and why to get out.

Pulled both pending orders -- got taged into G/U Lost a few pips, got out quick. I see from your charts - Just cant take any S/D area (unless your a 7 piper) - must wait for the outer zones, higher probability areas.

Nice shorter term trade there for you if you took the UJ - bob on. You know where TP1 is too. I didn't, I don't trade it and am maxed out on EJ anyway.

How are those cable longs? And still 63% short on FF. Excellent indicator . As it gets nearer 50% the 'trend' may be changing. Over 73% saying short on FF is an excellent indicator for long.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I like to also watch the FF position, Has anyone seen this as a indicator put on a chart, where it shows the FF posions on your chart. Thank you

iamsovereign, can you post your indicators, What is the dot in each candle ? is that candle mid point or something else thank you

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi Todd the indicators that you see come from the thread called- Supply and demand in a nutshell by alfonso moreno. if you sign up for Alfonsos webinars he will send a link for the latest indicators, and how to use them is in the thread. hope that helps. The dot in the middle of the candles shows that it is a base candle or canles.

Thanks for that- I was looking at that, now you confirmed it. Im starting to SEE and not look There are many mistakes on those charts I have been posting - still learning, Lets say how to tade it... I got lucky, (those limit orders that went my way) I know that now that I know more.... with all your sarcasim and hinting, eastern phil, and of course humer, has led me on the right path. I think Thanks so much for your time.

I see there's a retard who still hasn't fathomed that an H4 magic bar is a view of the past and not the present THOUSANDS of pips a week...from a method that was calculated to make 34 pips a week on average Want to trade 'H4'? Split your chart into 25 pip segments (depending on currency ATR for the period). See which way price has been going, 12 hours minimum, then, in the next H4 period, if price goes in the opposite direction and hits a '25' line, enter. Stop loss size 25 pips. Only enter once per H4 period. That way you're not entering at RANDOM prices (what is the high or low of an H4 magic bar that is different for every broker?). It's just as 'reliable' as any other bu11sh1t. After you hit the button and what happens next is what makes/loses money. How are you going to manage the tard? Let me guess. Go long and short at the same time, with the same amount and like an idiot call it 'hedging'

20% hit rate apparently and THOUSANDS of PIPS (pipeeeeetes??) per week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Where do they find them? Tarders: please feel free to post MANY posts saying "Thankyou, I've had one winning trade with this method and I've seen the light, before I was unsuccessful (on my last trade) but now I feel I can go full time with my life savings, thankyou again" The private group will be opening soon. Entry cost only the miniscule sum of £500 per month. Very cheap for the comedy lulz that will ensue I think. BTW How can it be known what the hit rate IS when it's only been traded for...about 2 weeks with a method that advocates never closing positions And I'll say it again...MARGIN requirement?

EU for call for the morning open going short was correct re that level BUT Attached Image (click to enlarge) Another level just below yeah? Ain't tex XXX just a biatch?? Even on large charts if you're not on the ball teh market will screw you over BIG TIME. Whichever way you cut it there is usually a level right in the way of which way you think it might go. Which level is going to break...a complete crapshoot. You'll never know.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
No tardering here, Just gratefull for direction Its a journey that never reaches a destination and the maps are all wrong Yes, the tex xxx is a bitach as you say, a complete crapshoot- went right thrue the level - throw the dice and Im going to Vegas, at least I get free drinks.....

Hay- Is this thread dead or what? See what happens when you mention money, or is that pounds. Trying to stay with the plan- trading the higher time frames only- sure cuts down on trades, This is a good thing. Trading the lower time frames leads to addiction- (overtrading, mocain) I learned on the lower TFs - did not know any better, the higher TFs seemed harder to trade to me.

You see the thing is, is that I have been at this for just over a year and self taught, and I havent spent a dime on any training as of yet - and the thing is, is that I have been profitable from the begining. I have never blown an acount (demo or live) I probably have spent min 9 hours a day for more than a year and some days all day from get up to go to sleep... I have tried every indicator made by man and even some by an alian on this site, I think I have tried every type of method, system that man, alian, can conceive. (haveing said that, Im always surprized when I find some other method, system xx.xx as you say) I have seen every scam and signals out there (I think!!). But the honest truth is, I have been making money from the beginning, I started on the M5 time frame because I could see somthing happening (during NY sessions) with PA and it seemed easy to get in and out in the right direction, I like the less than 5 minute trades, I thought every body did this, this is trading. Then someone said that was scalping and I should not do that (that was stupid ) I did not know anybetter and it seemed easy to me and I still SCALP when I see conditions are right. I was brought up on E/U on the 5M and doing just fine. What I find hard is the longer TFs (I cant see anything happening) so I feel like I cant predict where PA is going. YEH I know all that S &amp; R stuff and TL and FIBs and on and on. Supply alnd demand was something new to me when I found this thread, As I got further along in my training, All I could find and hear, and read is trade the longer TFs -Your stupid to trade M5 and all it is, is noise... Heres were Im at - I like to SCALP, I find it easy and I make money.... but I have no life and would like to be able to trade higher TFs and so I have been on a misson to find the most valid crap shoot for that purpose... by Using my brain, I have come to many of the conclusions that have been expoused on (is that even a word?) in this thread, You know how most of all this sh1t we call TA is just that sh1t, and a crap shoot, and the best we can do IS put the odds in our favor, YAA Right, not so much but still bull sh1t...... I am in search for longer TF trading that can be as good as my taking money from the big boys on the 5M.. Oh and of course my search for the holy grain will never end, because its out there, right?,.... and for just $$$ you to can be a millon air...

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Tard higher from lower. You are not tarding TFs. You are tarding PRICE. All a TF is in the end is how long you think you'll be able to hold AFTER you enter. See price within a daily bar (which doesn't exist). What can you do on this, the first day and only day the market existed EVER? You can trade the breakout from the open or you can trade a retrace from the extreme. What else could there be? Maybe even your daily magic bar is complete and utter bu11sh1t??

66% short cable still - good enough reason to be long. After a move that quick and comparatively that large TP

Went short cable this morning for some random reason

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Hay Nunrgguy, Hope you are doing well, 68% here on FF say short on cable and 32% say long, I see price is in a monthly S zone - not a fresh zone but it is a monthly. Good luck Note- I am with Axi corp broker and they will not be providing usa with service any longer- I have to find a new broker, bummer.....

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Yeah, like any indicator it's not 100%

I think im going to try a short on cable - possibley seting up ?

Dear Nunrgguy, wonderful thread, thanks a lot. Do you have a special technique how you measure momentum? Enclosed a Picture of the H4 EU, is this a correct way on defining momentum? Or am I completley wrong? Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Has anyone managed to come up with the 'Bu11sh1t Baffles Brains' EA yet?

Hi nunrgguy. I'm one of the 95's%. Today I started to practice your 'system'. I hope at the end of March I could say I didn't lose money. Today I achieved it (and I earned some R's). Thank you for your teaching.
