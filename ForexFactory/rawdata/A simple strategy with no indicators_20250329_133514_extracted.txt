Hello all, This is another simple strategy that I am currently using. You only look at the last 3 daily candles of any pair. Trends are insignificant in this strategy The rules are simply as follows: For going long: 1- Body of the latest Daily candle is greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles 2- Previous daily candle must be bearish 3- Close of latest candle is more than close of the previous candle 4- Take profit for next candle at the psychological levels: 50 &amp; 00 For going short: 1- Body of the latest Daily candle is greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles 2- Previous daily candle must be bullish 3- Close of latest candle is less than close of the previous candle 4- Take profit for next candle at the psychological levels: 50 &amp; 00

Nice....like the idea! Keep us posted and I'll follow along....

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Are you trading live or on demo?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Ezy and interesting. Pls. show some charts for illustrations and better understanding of your trading method. tpat

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I read 3 of your threads / trading methods with interest. Just that which one your would recommend based on successful rate? tpat

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks for sharing! Please post a chart/example when you get a chance.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi That's a really cool signal that looks like it hits TP often depending on where the Stoploss is placed. What are your thoughts on stop loss? Thanks! Dan

--- 帖子 #8 ---
A pair is traded only once per day at the maximum. I have just posted an example of this strategy

--- 帖子 #9 ---
live

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Similar to profit taking, you place the stop loss at the psychological levels 00 &amp; 50. So for example if you entered a long trade @ 1.2734, you could place the stop loss @ 1.2700 and place the target @ 1.2800. This is all subjective

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Great! Thanks for your thoughts on the matter.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
hi asraf, it is a nice method to read. i have 1 question after saw the attached chart. when do we decide to go for long/short? is it at the open candle of the next day? or did i miss something for the entry rule? thanks

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Roughly, how often you get a valid set up? Thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi ashraf More charts for better illustrations are good, please. One question: the chart posted (I presume it is a daily tf) showing the "latest" daily candle is not greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles? Sorry I might not correct, please comment. tpat

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Here is another example to make it clearer

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yes you trade at the open of the next day

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I meant that the last candle - which is technically your signal candle - must have a body that is greater than the body of the previous 2 candles. And you trade at the open of the next day candle after the completion of that signal candle. I hope I explained it better. Look at the last chart I posted

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Here is a bullish example:

--- 帖子 #19 ---
So far it is almost like 7 out of 10. But again your target and stop loss comply with this strategy as long as you set them up at the psychological levels

--- 帖子 #20 ---
OK. You meant to locate candlestick patterns. Thanks. Now I understood.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Actually this is a very nice easy method. I originally thought it inolved trading outside bars but realise I was mistaken. Wonder if anyone could write a simple indicator which would simply state something like "OK to trade long" or "Ok to Trade short" having automaticlaly examined the last 3 candles.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Just read the following article Inside Candle Breakout. You may find it benefits. http://visionsofaffluence.com/2010/0...ple-technique/

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thanks for posting it. It looks interesting but it is different from this strategy. I am always fond of strategies that depend on nothing but price action itself

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Another example:

--- 帖子 #25 ---
It is also worth mentioning that you have to be very wary of signals that have very wide range because sometimes you could easily get whipsawed. So always use stop losses ...no matter what

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi. I want a simple and complete strategy that I am going to program it with ea.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Here is an example where it is possible to get whipsawed if you were not careful

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Isnt this nothing but trading the famous candlestick patterns - "bullish and bearish engulfing" ??

--- 帖子 #29 ---
No it is not. It does not need to have an engulfing pattern in order to initiate the trading.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
See this example. The last candle in the box is not engulfing the previous candle. Yet it qualifies to be a signal as per the criteria of this strategy

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Ashraf, Thank you for sharing your trading ideas with us. Brokers differ as to when their days begin and end. This could have a profound effect on trading results. Please share what broker you use for this strategy. What has been your profitability with this method? Or is this merely an untested idea? Thanks, BC

--- 帖子 #32 ---
My broker is "FX Solutions". I have been using this method along with other methods for two weeks so it is relatively new. The success rate as I stated earlier is roughly 7 out of 10

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is a very good idea if someone could possibly code it...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
hey ashraf999 what a very simple stratagy have here i will have to put it on test from monday/tuesday opening to see how good it will fetch me some green also to figure out ur bokers time. am happy i didnt have to read 40pages to get to the last page keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I just love simplicity in trading. I wish if our lives were that simple

--- 帖子 #36 ---
i like the simplicity and it is a very easy set-up to lookout for while keeping to my normal strategy. thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Ashraf999, I have just finished reading your other threads, I really enjoyed following your trades on the daily charts, very clear explanations and very helpful. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=226817 This very simple method looks very interesting too. I love trading pure price action at support and resistance so anything that makes me focus on candlestick analysis at the end of the day on the daily charts is a bonus. I look forward to demo trading it as setups arise. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
hey ashraf In your post #15 the chart,on your entry ...looking @ that candle from daily chart you dont think that it went negative for like 50pips against you before in your favour (I may be wrong but by your posted chart) Again can you please tell us the opening hour of your candle in GMT (based on the fx solutions that you use)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Very simple indeed! Like the method......I'm definitely going to watch for set ups this week.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
The stop loss you specify - at 00 or 50 - depends on your risk tolerance. I agree that it could go against you first before it turns in your favor and vise versa but that is the nature of trading..it is the ability to take risks without losing your nest. I live in Saudi Arabia and the trading day according to FX Solutions starts at 9:00 PM (GMT)

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Thanks for sharing. Would it be possible to make an indicator for this? And what about to check also lower timeframes, e.g. H4 or H1. For example after we get a signal on D1, then check if there is the same candle formation on H4 or H1 and if yes, then enter into the trade.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi There, I could do an indicator to scan 19 low spread pairs on each new bar. You will need to run it on one pair on the timeframe of your choice. It will then scan and alert pairs suitable for this strat at that moment. Anyone intersted please pm me. Regards ECFOREX

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Please post the indicator here...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Do you use the smaller Sunday night candle as a regular day candle...or do you simply skip the Sunday candle and use the last full day candle (Friday)? Then, what broker do you use as the candles will all be different depending on the individual broker.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Good that you brought this point..I use the last full day candle. My broker is "FX Solutions"

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I don't know how to make an indicator for this. I just observe and make the decision based on that observation. For this strategy, I only use the daily timeframe

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello ashraf How frequent such mentioned candlestick pattern appears? In a week vs. in a month? Thanks tpat

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I am not sure how many. But if you scan all the major pairs, you could find a valid pattern. For example, NZDUSD has a valid pattern today as per "FX Solutions". However, this is Monday so we don't have a complete full candle like the other days

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Check also EURJPY - although it is not currently a winning trade

--- 帖子 #50 ---
This is NZDUSD as per "FX Solutions"..and it is a winning trade ...until now

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi ashraf999 Do you use it for all the currencies? Also There's any indicator who can identify a candel bigger than the 2 previous? That would very useful, cause making backtest by hand its hard to see 20 pips diferences on Daily charts Thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I was backtesting a strategy just like this one last week, and then stumbled onto your thread. I didn't use the two candle rule you have, just the longer real body on the reversal candle. So far I have tested three pairs since the beginning of the year. All three show great results; wins are over 50% and the average for wins is higher than the losers. Here is the MM technique I have been using. S/L was set to 75. Once I open a trade, I didn't check on it until the next day. If it was profitable, I dragged my S/L to 2/3 the length of the winning candle. Then I would repeat this each day until I got stopped out, so the trade might last several days in a strong trend. I never used a limit, just left it open until it hit my stop. If at the close of a day the trade were negative but had not hit my stop loss, I would close the position for a loss and move on. One thing i have noticed about this strategy is that many times when you get losing trades, the losing candle ends up as a signal in the other direction and often gains back more than you lost by taking the new trade. I did just have 2 losers with this strategy overnight with EurJpy and GbpJpy, but if I had put my stops at 100 instead of 75, I would still be in both of them, the GbpJpy would be in profit right now.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yes I use it for all pairs. But I tend to be more cautious with the JPY pairs for any strategy I may use because of their high volatility. I do not think it is necessary to create an indicator for it. Just train your eyes and that will be sufficient

--- 帖子 #54 ---
thanks for the time clearification.i assume you mean 21:00 GMT

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Interesting method ashraf999 Thanks for posting. I'm backtesting your system before throwing money at it but it seems very good. I like KISS systems!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Can you give one buy or sell so I can back engineer, I am not all that good with candles? thanks if possible.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
to me i dont think that an indicator is needed in this ............is just a one time stuff

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes ..and you are welcome

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Sure...please see the attached chart:

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I will keep everyone posted on my results with this system. BTW, I am using FXCM , and my daily candles close at 5PM EST, which I believe is 10PM GMT.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
5pm EST is 9pm GMT and 10pm UK time

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Got it, thanks.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
what is the succdess ratio ? could you post some results for the past few weeks ? also, which pair it works best with ? does it work well on stocks and shares e.g. home retail group etc , and wall street (dow) ? thanks

--- 帖子 #64 ---
when you say 'greater than the body of the last 2 candles', do you mean the total length of the 2 candles added together, i.e. the signal candle must be greater than the total length, or just the length of each one ? thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
hi what is the minimum length of the 2 previous candles we need to have, i.e. how many pips in length must they be at least ? and if the candles are too long, then that is a false signal right ? regards

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I have finished a scanner indicator ... Install it as indicator and run on one screen on time frame of your choice. It will scann ALL low spread pairs on every new bar .. so if u install it on M15 charts it will scan every 15 minutes. If you change TF it will scan immediately and then every new bar in the new TF ... like H1 ... then it will scan once per hour .. I ignores the incompleted/last bar completely. Please remember it scans for the BODY of the candle to be inside the previous bar. I am also attaching a scanner for the Full candle to be inside the previous bar as per definition of real inside bar ... use which ever tickles your fancy.. Enjoy ECFOREX

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks. I dropped it on GU daily and it gives me a set up on USDCFH and Eurgbp, drop it on EU and it gives me a set up on Gbpjpy. Does that sound correct?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
OK - this all sounds pretty clear until you start parsing the words. Lastest, Previous, Next are pretty clear. When looking at post 59, you identify 2 clear trades, but they are surrounded by losing trades. I must miss the essence of your instructions. I have written a prospect identifier and tester with results posted for total Buy pips, Sell Pips, Win count and Loss count. BuTTT, I don't get any positive results. So - I am missing something. Here is the indicator/tester for what it is worth. When describing bars, I always use P0, P1, P2 to identify the current, current+1 etc. Indy display Blue Up Arrow = BuyProspect, Gold Dn Arrow = Sell Prospect, Lime Diamond = Win Trade, Red Diamond = Loss Trade. Enjoy, KingHigh

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I meant greater than the body of each one of the previous 2 candles

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Post the chart please

--- 帖子 #71 ---
There will be always losing trades. I actually posted one of them here. And your signals are correct according to the strategy

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Also note that the trade is not allowed to remain for more than one trading day...Post the chart where you don't have positive results

--- 帖子 #73 ---
could you tell me which pair it works best with ? does it also work on stocks and the dow ? also, when do we close out the trade ? what if the trade reverses hits stop before moving in the right direction ? i back tested it on one of the pairs yesterday, there are a lot of false signals. i found 4 false and 1 correct signal ! anyway, maybe i chose the incorrect pair ? lastly, to go long, the previous candle to the signal candle must be bearish right ? but what if the signal candle is also bearish but opens higher and closes higher. is this still a correct signal candle ? have you compiled any results ? thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It generally works on all pairs. But as I said before, I am more cautious with the jpy pairs than other pairs for any strategy I choose to follow. Can you post a chart of those false signals you mentioned?. Remember you do not need to wait for the close of the trading day to know whether your trade was a winner or not. You decide what your target and stop losses are and based on that you make your move. Sometimes, the price hits your target before it moves away in the opposite direction. So it is very possible you win a trade despite you decided to go long while the candle closed bearish at the end of the day. A signal candle must be opposite to the previous one. So if the signal candle is bullish, the previous must be bearish and vise versa I use this strategy for forex trades only. I have not tried it on stocks

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I love simplicity yet profitable method like this. Thank you for sharing... How many of you are currently profiting using this technique. May I have "a show of hand"??

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I got crushed trading eur/jpy a few days ago. I think some news came out over night which caused the trade to lose.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Sorry to hear that.. Did you set your target and stop losses, or did you just wait till the close of the trading candle?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
You are welcome

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I suggest to aim for the "next" psychological level if you want to play it safe. So if you went short @ 1.3289 , aim for 1.3250 instead of 1.3200

--- 帖子 #81 ---
iam looking for a pair with reasonable movements. not too volatile. maybe about 30 pips a day. can anyone help ? most major pairs seem really volatile and can move 100 or so points a day.

ashraff999 , The 2nd high-lighted trade ( circled ) does not appear to have been a valid set-up ? Am I missing something on that trade set-up ? I like the simplicity of the method and will follow it to gain confidence in the set-ups. Thanks for sharing it . Best of trades , EZ

--- 帖子 #87 ---
It is a valid set-up but resulted in a loss had you waited till the close of the candle. However, if you set up the target at the psychological level 88.50, you would have won the trade despite it closed bearish. Thanks for your input

--- 帖子 #92 ---
hi a few things still need to be clarified. when you say the body of the signal candle must be higher than the previous two. do you count the top and bottom wicks as part of the body ? by how many pips must the body be higher by at least ? in order to count a candle as valid, what is the minimum width it has to be, i.e. at least how many pips it has to be ? you see some candles are only about 2-3 pips in body, some are just a wick. so how do you count a candle as being valid. what is the minimum pips it has to be in body ? i see there is a set on the gbp / usd pair, short signal. do you agree ? regards

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I agree on GBP/USD. I am short on it since 5 pm EST. Also short EUR/JPY (already up 50 pips) and GBP/CHF (still around break even).

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Ashraf99 and all, Today (22.July.2010) spotted GU short setup, is it a valid short setup? http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/s...2_GU_Short.jpg If yes, would u think that the SL is too small for a D1 trade? Broker : IBFX

--- 帖子 #95 ---
no wicks...just the body which is the distance between open and close. If it is a doji then there is no body because the open would be the close itself. As long as there is a "difference" between open and close, then there is a body.. Yes there are valid gbpusd, eurjpy &amp; gbpjpy setups

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes this a valid setup as per this strategy. The SL is too small indeed. But I would take the risk and trade it. You may set your stop loss higher @ 1.5250. That is entirely your decision. But remember to always and always set your stop losses no matter what happens

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi max I read comments from some seniors advising that G-U has large pips swing everyday, easily &gt; 100. Thus SL should set more. IMO. tpat

--- 帖子 #98 ---
thank you so much ecforex for the indi, is it possible you can post the code ?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
ashraf99 &amp; tradpat Yes, I thought so, shd hv higher SL. Thanks http://i589.photobucket.com/albums/s..._GU_Short2.jpg SL : TP = 1:2 SL2 : TP = 1:0.5 SL2 : TP2 = 1:1.2 Just trying to look for better RR ratio. Let see how it goes

--- 帖子 #100 ---
i have gone thru all the pages. like this simple daily strategy. entry is good. only issue is sl and tp, we cant have same sl,tp for all pairs due to different volatility. also risk reward ratio should be 2, may be we can use ATR to derive the SL,TP , i like the psychological levels 00, 50 also but sometimes they are too close. if we have a EA then we can tweak the SL/TP values for each pair.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
also we need to name this startegy. some suggestions 3D Scanner BigBody Strategy

--- 帖子 #102 ---
the gbp/usd short set up would have been stopped out. so a false signal ? according to my research the gbp/usd pair is not a good pair to trade with this system ? too many false signals ? also, it appears the signals are very few. in the 3 pairs i looked at last night, i only found about 4 signals in the last 5 months ? so one has to wait a long time for the signals to arise. so is it a system worth using for regular traders ? regards

--- 帖子 #103 ---
hi the signal candle must be higher than the previous two but at least by how many pips minimum ? when you say the the close of signal candle should be higher / lower, do you mean the signal candle must close at a higher / lower price at the close of trading day ? regards

--- 帖子 #104 ---
how did your trades go ? i know gbp/usd got stopped out. as for gbp/chf, i think that pair did well. eur/jpy and gbp/jpy might have been stopped out ? regards

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Been trading live for about 2 months now and I'm a regular visitor on FF. This is my very first post. I really like this strategy but I think the SL/TP pts might need to be tweeked a little bit. Instead of setting the SL/TP based on psych levels of 00/50, how about using the pivot pts since they are calculated based on the price action for the previous day and would serve better as resistance/support pts? For EUR/JPY, you would've shorted the pair based on this strategy @ 111.03. The daily pivot was 111.44, which would've served as SL. The TP would've been the MS1 level of 110.75 or you could've let it ride all the way down to the S1 level of 110.06. I know the R:R for the MS1 level trade is not 1:1 but even with the psych level strategy, the R:R has to be dynamically adjusted. Perhaps for this trade, instead of using MS1, you could've moved it down another 20 pips for the TP. If the pivot level is too close, say within 20 pips, to the entry price, then use the next level. For this example, if the entry would've been at 111.30 then you would've used the MR1 level of 111.81 as SL. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I know people set their targets and stop losses differently than this one in general but for me the psychological levels for this particular strategy serve me well. And at the end, you set your stop losses according to your risk tolerance regardless whether they were around pivot points or psychological levels. I sometimes set the risk to reward ratio at more than 2:1. For some other people, this is a big no no. Thanks for your input

--- 帖子 #107 ---
One pip can make the difference. So if you were going long and the signal candle's body is more than the body of any of the 2 previous candles by only 1 pip, then it is a valid criteria. The close must be higher for a signal candle than the close of the previous candle when going long, and the close must be lower for a signal candle than the close of the previous candle when going short. It is really not that complicated

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Yes they were stopped out. GBP/CHF was a winner.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thank you for this scanner. I installed it today. It said it was scanning but never came up with anything. Am I missing something? Thanks for your help.

hi buddy plz what are the pairs that u checked also i think this couldnt stop u if u are a regular trader.is just a one time thing then u go about ur trading style.just my own suggestion

--- 帖子 #113 ---
also, what happens on a friday of the week ? say the signal candle appears on a friday, but the markets are closed over the weekend. and on the monday the markets open with a gap in price. how would you enter the trade then ? or is it best not to take fridays signals ? regards

--- 帖子 #114 ---
It is a valid entry according to this strategy but until now it is generating a loss

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Trade full candles. So avoid Monday trades if possible (for this strategy)

On my chart it was. I was able to close it for +11 pips.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
what signals did people have for yesterday ? i had a buy on eur/usd, and a sell on usd/cad. does anyone agree ? regards

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hi not sure what you mean by body should be 1/3 of the candle ? a body is a body, even if its 1 pip ?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
when body is less it shows indecision, when its 0 its called doji bigger body means the trend is good ,,,, always closing matters

--- 帖子 #129 ---
how do you determine body is 1/3 of a candle ?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
My rules for this strategy do not include that body should be 1/3 of the candle. As long as the difference between open and close is not 0, then it is a body

--- 帖子 #131 ---
The best way to know whether they are valid or not is to post their charts

Hi Ashraf, I never realised how powerful the engulfing pattern was, especially when it engulfs 2 or more candles. I have been applying it to the H1 time frame and lower (I trade just European open) It works a treat. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I am glad it is working for you

--- 帖子 #134 ---
This is my first post at FF. Thanks to all for the contributions to this thread. Attached is an EA implementing ashrraf999 strategy. This EA is inappropriate for live trading because it is coded very simply to test the theory here. The input parameter MinimumPsych sets the minimum pips from entry price to TP and SL psyches. The pair's spread gets added or subtracted to this value. To you Strategy Tester experts out there, you know how tough it's become to acquire good M1 history data since March, when MetaQuotes History Center began allowing the huge gaps. Using FXDD data from http://www.fxdd.com/en/mt1m-data.html I ran one-year back tests on EURUSD, GBPUSD and USDJPY. Sadly, these pairs seem to show little promise.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
It was here and then it went. "BarDirection Trades v1" V odd.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Anyone think that will be a good idea to put only a stoch on this Daily strategy as a confirm about overbought/oversold levels? but how to set it, i don't know...sorry.

what is a H1 timeframe and lower ? what time do you trade (british time) and what pair do you use ? are you using this ashrafs system only ?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
hi my signals for close of today are as follows: GBP/EUR - long USD/CHF - long USD/JPY - long EUR/GBP - short are these ok ? just making sure iam following the system right. regards

Your signal for UJ is correct based on the strategy, but I would hate to go long on UJ these days EG seems too much wick after candle body...maybe sign of indecision???

i have one more dilemma. the broker i use is igindex. thier daily candles actually finish at midnight (bst) , long after the markets close. and the next daily candle opens a minute after midnight. so any trades entered will have to be a minute after midnight (next day candle). bearing this in mind, as the candles end long after the markets have closed, are the candles still valid signal candles ?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
A trade using H1 engulfing bars this morning. Keep an eye out, they work well. sorry for the off topic (lower timeframe) post Ashraf

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Hi Jag, what is the engulfing bar? sorry am a newbee

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Your broker is different from mine. So if the pairs you listed above conform to this strategy, then they are valid. The only way to know whether they are valid or not is to post them

--- 帖子 #148 ---
how do i post my charts on here ? iam not very good with computers (even in this day and age !).

--- 帖子 #149 ---
ashraf999 uses fx solutions so u have to figure this out through http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/

--- 帖子 #150 ---
save the chart on ur pc the u follow the same way u post things here but make sure that u use the correct formats as listed on the attachment manager

--- 帖子 #151 ---
this is a kind of system am looking for. is another way of studying candle sticks. its nice. i am using alpari. its very ok on weekly chat too.kudos. my stop loss is closest swing candle.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
yeah you may have a point there.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Jag: These are great examples...thanks. Can you supply a little recent history of t/f's and pairs that are working good for you? I really love this simple system...I dont have to guess with indicators and that I don't really understand anyway, but I do understand momentum and price action.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
A work in progress losingtrades, but these engulfing bars / candles do work. Pure PA ,SR and candlestick analysis. I like the hour before Frankfurt open best. Like groundhog day again, 6 - 7 am UK time works well. Any currency with a reasonable spread will do.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
hi jag, i think its a good idea to start a new thread for this system, we can discuss more.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
H1 is the one hour timeframe, I trade 5.30 to 9am UK time, preferably before the Frankfurt and London opens at 7am and 8am respectively. I trade any pair with a decent spread but the targets are from H1 and the entries from m5 so most major currency pairs work well. I just trade pure price action using support and resistance and trend analysis Ashraf, sorry for the off topic posts. Your engulfing bars / candles are just so amazing.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
But I still consider myself a newbie at price action, Ashraf is the boss and trading the dailies is without doubt the best advice. I may start a thread when I have more experience trading these setups. Happy trading all.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
For those who are confuse about this method, though it is too earlier, but because of the price trend today, i think eurusd, audusd may have a valid setting according to alpari uk if it ends this way today. i will wait until close of todays candle to determine. the trend may continue tomorrow-

--- 帖子 #159 ---
what is engulfing bars / candles ?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
eur/usd is not a valid set up, as the previous candle was a bull candle.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I also would be keen on an engulfing bars thread, or perhaps a more generalized price action / candle-analysis thread, whichever. Also, I hate to see this thread running so off topic. Not fair to Ashraf or readers interested in his strategy introduced here.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...9&amp;postcount=15 It is what we are trading whatfx, in this instance the body of the candle is larger than the body of the two preceeding candles.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
My sincere apologies to Ashraf and all.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
This set-up does not require engulfing bars.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
from my platform, alpari uk, it may be if the candle ends the way it is now. i will demo buy at the begining of tommorrow candle if it ends this way today. mind you diffrent platform will give diffrent signal

--- 帖子 #166 ---
No biggie. There was a definite overlap of subject when ashraf posted the example that showed a powerful engulfing bar. You wrote, "I may start a thread when I have more experience trading these setups." Please don't hesitate. I for one would be keen on following your progress.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Wow, what a dyslexic thread. If I may make a few comments/suggestions... ashraf999: You have a simple, innovative method here. Nice job. I would suggest you post your trades as you see them with your suggested TP and SL and then also keep a running tally of your win/loss percentage and pip count for everyone to see. Then maybe people will quit asking the "how profitable", "which pairs," etc. ad nauseum. Others: 1) This is a daily method that uses round number levels for TP and SL. If you want to experiment with other timeframes or you want to use other methods of TP and SL, no one is stopping you. But if you have some success with your derivation of ashraf999's method, I think the right thing to do would be to begin a new thread with your idea out of respect for ashraf999, as the nature and profitability of the system will change dramatically when those those parameters are modified. 2) This is not a thread to ask for instructions on how to post charts or what an engulfing bar is or what pivot points are, etc. Sheesh. Look, I realize people have these questions when they're first starting out, but there are many places (both at FF and on the web) where you can get these answers without needlessly cluttering up this thread. Just go to Google and type your question in there. Scott

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Well said, Scott! Moving on, here's yet another indicator. This one marks historical signals in green and red, as well as a prospective white signal on the forming candle. Thanks goes to KingHigh for much of the original coding.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Engulfing Bars are a subset of the signals generated by this system. This method uses the size of the body (open and close) of the candles. A Bar is considered an Engulfing candle when the bar's high is higher than the previous candle's high and the candle's low is lower than the previous bar's low. Check out this link for more ... http://www.babypips.com/forexpedia/Engulfing_Pattern In the Attached picture C is an engulfing Candde to B C is NOT an engulfing candle to A This is a valid entry (just based on the candle portion) for this method. Because the Body(in pips) of candle C is bigger than the body(in pips) of candle B AND the Body(in pips) of candle C is bigger than the body(in pips) of candle A. Mark

--- 帖子 #170 ---
thank you for the indicator. it will be very good.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
To anyone... Are you ignoring candles that qualify but have big wicks either below and/ or above? thanks

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The indicator treats those candles you described just as any other qualifying candle.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
i think ashraf answered this question previously. no, wicks dont make any difference, unless it is a doji.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
only one set up today. aud/usd. long. i find, with this system, the signals are rare, lucky to get 2-3 signals a week and those could even go against.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
how are these indicators relevant to this system ? how do i download them onto my igindex platform (u.k.) and get them to work.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I checked out the signals generated by this indicator/system on all pairs and all timeframes; the results were no better than a 50% win rate. How can you make money with a system that gives only a 50% win rate?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Same as I've seen running tester with the EA. About 50% except JPY pairs show a little better.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
how have you concluded at 50%, do you have a EA ? what SL, TP you used ? with better RR even 50% winning system could be very good

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Yes that is right

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Ashraf, Thanks for sharing this system! I really like the simplicity of it! Leftcoaster ps. I sent you a PM.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thanks for your comments. I used to look for any indicator there is before I realized that price action is what I should have concentrated on. I have a journal called "Daily Charts" that posts actual live trades. However, it is not pertinent to one single strategy. The purpose of this thread is purely educational.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
hi ashraf would u mind posting the rules again in the first post with more clear language there is some confusion .. please do it again thanks

--- 帖子 #183 ---
What part of the rules you did not understand so I may clarify it?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
For going long: 1- Body of the latest Daily candle is greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles 2- Previous daily candle must be bearish 3- Close of latest candle is more than close of the previous candle Number 3 what do u mean by more than close of the previous candle?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
read for "more" higher the price at the close of the last candle should be higher than the price of the one before that

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi Ashraf999, Many thanks for your endeavours here. Do you find that trades run smoother during days were there is no release of economic data? I trade a variety of methods, all based on PA, but find that the macro fundamentals tend to override technical analysis....at least in the short term. I do not believe news, data etc. is already discounted in the price, not at our humble retail level. I would also tend to agree with qwertyfx, that this should not be viewed in isolation of support &amp; resistance, trending behaviour etc. especially not for those new to this. Keep up the great work and thank you for not being cryptic as a lot of thread creators appear to be on FF. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #187 ---
KingHigh, Possible filters to avoid the losses if you are not going to take profit quickly is of course to trade with the trend and upon the breakout of the signal candle's range. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #188 ---
The pattern is composed of 3 candles. If we can number them 1, 2 &amp; 3 (which is the signal candle), then to go long candle 3 must close higher than candle 2. And if we decided to go short, then candle 3 must close lower than candle 2

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Hi ChilliPipper, I do not count economic news as a criteria for this strategy. And the reason why I prefer daily is there is usually less noise and more clarity with the daily than intra-daily charts . It is just a personal preference. According to this strategy, you exit the trade within the same day of entering the trade. You do not keep it for the next trading day. So for me that is why the impact of support &amp; resistance, trending behaviour etc is minimal. Thanks again for your comments. I also find it hard to follow those "cryptic" threads. For me, they add more confusion than clarity to the reader.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Just an observation: If candles 1 &amp; 2 were spinning tops or pin bars (hammers) while candle 3 (the signal candle) was a long candle, you would have a better probability of success with this strategy. However this is not a rule.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
yeah. i noticed that and about to post that. hammer, morning stars ...give better trade even for days in the direction of the main trend in my own opinion.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
sorry, but what is a spinning top or pin bar ? do you have charts as examples ? thanks

--- 帖子 #193 ---
what were your results for these two trades ?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
i think i have mentioned this before. but can we please come up with a successful TP/SL combination that works best. i usually have my stop loss set at 100 pips. with quick TPs of 30 pips. the problem with this is that although i might have 3-4 wins in a row, the one loss (reaching stop loss of 100 pips) wipes out the gains made. so does anyone have any suggestions of how to tweak this system especially with regards to the tp/sl combination ?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
have you compiled a results table yet and do you have past results you can post ? also, out of all the systems you are using, which one would you say is your best system in terms of profitability ? regards

--- 帖子 #196 ---
No I have not compiled a result table. I would not call this system my favorite but it is one of the systems I am actively using

--- 帖子 #197 ---
which one is your favourite system ashraf

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi Ashraf &amp; All, I trade a similar style to this on intra-day. I think your entry's are good in that you are either taking a reversals or break outs based on price action also you do this at times when the market is undecided or consolidating (hence inside bars) However I think you will greatly improve your chances of success if you take into account where you are in the current market. E.g where are you in the current swing/Trend? where are you in the bigger price channel? and where is the recent S&amp;R. To identify the swings and trend I use fractals. If a up fractal is broken my bias is bullish and vice versa. To identify the channel you can use the equidistant of the trend line fractals or the zigzag indicator. Have a look at the attached.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
hi ashraf which one is your favourite system ? also, what are pinbars and hammers ? so far, what has been the success ratio using this system ? yesterday i had two signals from the majors: GBP/EUR - long, and EUR/USD - long. do you agree ? regards

--- 帖子 #200 ---
first of all, go to post 168, download the sds indicator, it will be helpful, i gained about 128 pips on eurusd long,hit tp on 2nd, aug. for kiwi, i did not trade it because by the time the candle closed, the arrow from the indicator on post 168 has dessapeared. now this is how i analyse my trade 1. i go to weekly chat, draw reasonable, major SR using fibonacci retracment, to know whats happening and what is the major trend... 2. eurusd is very strong buy at fibo 38.2 now. i now come back to daily chat. i dont trade counter trend. i will be looking for buy arrow signal using the indicator above or analzing it manually as explained by ashraff. 3. stop loss and tp, i consider minor support and resistance area for my sl initially then later adjust to resonable points when in profit. i use 70-80% of ATR 14 for my tp. simple. it will be around 100 pips daily if on my favor. i also put in to consideration, formation of HAMMER AND STARS before i pull the trigger. 4. as at 4th,aug 00.00am. SIGNAL SELL ON USDJPY. WEEKLY.TREND= SELL ARROW ON DAILY=SELL. I DEMO IT FOR 70 PIPS SELL COS IT IS VERY CLOSE TO FIBO 0.00 ON WEEKLY. I WILL SEE HOW IT GOES BEFORE NEXT CANDLE

--- 帖子 #201 ---
adeforex, Thanks for your contribution. Regarding the 4 August 00:00 USDJPY sell signal, and using only ashraf's psych levels, the trade hit TP three hours into the today's candle as shown on the one minute chart below. These SL/TP psyches seem very tight, but it is a winning trade. It will be interesting to see where price moves during the remainder of this daily candle. Attached Image Daily chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) M1 price action

--- 帖子 #202 ---
i closed my trades after i found out with 23 pips profit. many pairs are also retracing. am happy i did that cos many pairs will change direction. i can see a lot of hammer forming. devogel, please how does only ashraf's psych levels work,he said 0.00,0.50 .please can you explain in just a simple way. i didnt use before but found it very useful as you explained. thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---
This is an interesting system. It reminds me of something so simple that I still shiver when I think on it. One summer my 13 year old niece wanted to trade so I put up a demo account on a different computer of a daily 10 year bond chart. I showed her the ladder which she had no interest in. In the end she said buy red bars and sell green bars. I said you do it. So if the day before bond bar was red she would place a buy order above it's wick, if the next day was bullish she was filled and made demo dollars with a trailing stop. Her hard stop was below yesterdays low. If it was green she would put a sell order in below its wick and sold it with trailing stop. Granted not every buy red went up every day some days it went red for a few days and not get filled,but she did make money with a positive RR. It opened my eyes to how powerful price action can be. After a few months she got bored but I'll never for get it. Maybe we make it to complicated or maybe we like it that way so we can call ourselves sophisticated. Opps sorry i forgot to add the most important part:she was buying red bar if price was over 10ma and selling green bar if price was below 10ma. It was still so simple a monkey could do it and it still followed a trend. Which 10yr bond does well.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
"Body of the latest Daily candle is greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles" I've seen you give examples where this does not hold true, where the latest daily is only grater than the previous daily, or not even that. We are talking about body here right? Not wicks.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Maverick731, Thanks for your post. You pose good questions. Yes, we are talking about body. Not wicks. You have stated that part of the Ashraf candle pattern correctly, but I would add one word to make it clearer: "Body of the latest COMPLETED daily candle is greater than body of the previous 2 daily candles" Also, as stated earlier, if a broker time is different than Ashraf's GMT+3, the daily candle patterns will be different. So, some of the participants' charts here will disagree. Same is true with brokers who finish the trading week early or start late. Please tell me a post # where you see an example that disagrees. Kind regards

--- 帖子 #206 ---
well the body part is what was confusing me, you mean just the range of open/close I am guessing. Before I thought the body of the latest candle had to be greater (engluf) both previous candles

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Yes, that's exactly right: just the range of open/close. As far as the signal candle engulfing the previous one or two bars, that isn't a rule but it sometimes does occur.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Good move taking your profit when you did. To quote Ashraf from post #10, "you place the stop loss at the psychological levels 00 &amp; 50. So for example if you entered a long trade @ 1.2734, you could place the stop loss @ 1.2700 and place the target @ 1.2800. This is all subjective" My interpretation of that is, we place SL and TP by rounding our entry price by 0.50 for yen pairs or 0.xx50 for other pairs. In other words, round by 50 pips. If your trade platform uses fractional pip pricing, I suggest you ignore the fractional pip unless you are a math whizz and can deal with the complication. Sometimes this rounding results in a psych that is too close to entry, so we must then move away from entry by another 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
thanks. got it now

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Ashraf, Please, a clarification. If all signal rules are satisfied, but previous candle 1 and/or previous candle 2 is a perfect doji, do we still have a valid signal? Thank you

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Two signals to trade the new candle: GBPJPY short and NZDUSD short. The GJ just barely squeaked in on my feed due to body size of previous candle #2. Both are showing an inital move into profit.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
For those of you following the 6 August GBPJPY signal mentioned earlier, I find the following chart a compelling example of a core philosophy in this thread: the value of considering phychological levels when setting TP and SL. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi thank you for your great system.in this example you said we have to be careful to not be whipsawed. how we have to be careful? because it is exactly as you guided us in your first post. regards Fred

--- 帖子 #214 ---
This is the strategy I use the most. Pinbars are candles that have bodies near to top or bottom of the candle where the length of the body is about 1/3 of the total length of the candle. The rate is about 70%. Again, your broker is different from mine. So in order to know whether your pick follows this strategy or not, it is important to post the charts

--- 帖子 #215 ---
The engulfing pattern is not a requirement. Body is simply difference between open and close. So the body length of the signal (the 3rd candle) must be greater than the length of each of the previous 2 candle bodies. And for going long, the signal must close higher than the previous candle. And for going short, the signal must close lower than the previous candle

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Sometimes you get a candle's body that is 10 times larger (or even more) than the previous candle's body (like MARUBOZU candles). There is always possibility of going against that signal candle the next day if traders did not maintain the momentum. There is no rule for this case. So your next action here depends on your personal judgment

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi, This is an interesting post, have you ever read the Quarters Theory book by Ilian Yotov, he goes over the minor quarter points which are 00's and then breaks it down to 250 pip levels. So you have to be careful if going past a 250 or 750 level with target as a 00. Fred

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Ashraf, your strategy is smart. What HAPPENS if everybody will follow your strategy?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
oh ok i got it,plus before you have mentioned that this is not 100% system.its about 70% which is great. thank you Fred

--- 帖子 #220 ---
hi 70% on what tp/sl combination ? if it is 70% then will it make profit on the long run, as a couple of stops hit will wipe out any previous profits ? the broker i use , their daily candles close at midnight british standard time. so i would enter on the next candle at one minute past midnight. so iam not sure if these candles will give correct signals ? when you enter on your next daily candle what is the time according to british standard time ? regasrds

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Ashraf, Are you today trading our USDCAD signal? Regards

--- 帖子 #222 ---
I would stick with trading with the daily trend. I noticed that the signals going against the trend aren't working out that great.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes, I have also seen that happening. I did not want to mention this because it is not part of the basic rules. But we are all free to employ our individual spinoffs.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
i will rather follow a clear trend with the method.......not trading uscad. its not clear for me. the previous candle is too long...gbpchf forming signal with the trend...hope it will favour at the opening of tommorrow

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I like simple systems the best, and I stumbled on this thread today. Here's an indicator that signals the candle that meets the criteria mentioned. The signal arrow is on the candle that completes the pattern, so the next candle after the arrow is the traded one. It can be used in any timeframe. The parameters are: pipspace = a number that determines how far away to paint the candle usetrend = true; limits the signals to the ones in the prevailing trend, which is determined by: longavg = the long ema shortavg = the short ema If you want to see all the signals, just set usetrend to false. Dwain

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Dwain, totally great! Thanks much for the indy. Things are getting more and more interesting here.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
good work... thanks...

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I also was uncertain about the trade for yours and other reasons, but took it anyway. It did touch the .0300 psyche mid-candle, and I should have been satisfied with that. Now I'll be happy with a BE. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #230 ---
how do i install these indicators on my ig index broker platform ?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
i took it on live trading, because of great resistance on fibo 38.2. Before i even woke up (in less than 5 hours) it hit the TP with TP of 100 pips + spread. see also winners on usdchf,audusd ,nzusd, except usdjpy which may still turn to a winning trade(bullish) in couple of days ahead due to strong support IMHO. if you are careful with your analysis you may have a winning trade often and often.am waiting for more opportunities.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
gave a short signal on chf/jpy last night. i went short on chf/jpy. got out now at +30 pips. could have netted the 50 pips tp though.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
how did you manage so many winning trades ? and what is your method of using the fibos ?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I like your willingness to learn but it would be of great benefit for you to obtain basic forex knowledge by using the "search" section on the forex factory board while DEMO trading methods.Try to understand Forex basics and how or why a forex pair moves to one direction or another

--- 帖子 #235 ---
i use weekly,even a times monthly chat to judge my fibo and locate the trend direction and also to see previous candle formation. with this, i can even leave my trades for days cos i dont have much time to sit on the computer. usdjpy is now bullish. the method is cooooooooooolll. more piping a head

todays total pips= 144, usdjpy still running at a loss. dont care for now. will see how it will end

are you on live account now? trade with caution. tommorrow may be nice. gpbjpy is cool but too much volatility on the pair. missed chfjpy but its ok.

I'm still on demo. Thanks for any and all advise, it's always welcome. I see that the EJ is also showing a prospective signal, large fat-bodied candle, which I believe people here have cautioned about. Regards

--- 帖子 #242 ---
see how fast one can loose a winning trade without a TP today as many pairs retraced.lost on usjpy, but still make a net of 90+ pips. Do you relly know what caused this HEAVY RETRACEMENT? it is FOMC Statement, around 18.30 GMT...that is why you need to watch what is going on fundamentally before trading...trade with caution dude

Hi to everyone on this thread! This is my first post ever on forex factory! I have been using this site for about a year now, and this is the first thread that I feel most comfortable being part of, and will be trying to use this system. I went short today on AUD/JPY, I will keep everyone posted on my progress. Thank you [IMG]file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Fred/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.png[/IMG][IMG]file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/Fred/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.png[/IMG]Ashraf for taking the time to share your system with us!!! PS. By the time I have finished writing this, I am already in 30 pips Profit!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
pheonix, u are welcome,you are right, short on audjpy and its a winning trade,also gpjpy.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks Adeforex, I went short today from 77.838 ( i jumped in a couple of hours before the third candle was finished, but i saw the opportunity). Closed Profits at 77.500 Then went in short again at 77.331 and closed profits at 77.221 for some quick pips. I will try and post up some pictures(haven't done this before, but i will give it my best) when i get home, still at work at the moment. So far +44pips (including spread)

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I'm still assessing, but demo'ed the three JPY related pairs at the close, short on the EURJPY, GBPJPY and AUSJPY. Nice! Only wish I had put the take-profit out a little farther. Does anyone try to use any certain risk-reward in their stop and take-profit placement? I know you use the psych levels on the hundreds and 50's, I'm just wondering if you use any other logic to tell you which of those to choose.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
so if setup on daily near RN... target will be the next RN right? could someone post daily A+ setups (best) .. i find sometimes when 3rd candle is equal or just little smaller to 1st or 2nd it still works...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
that is what i enquired about earlier in the thread. i.e. a successful tp/sl combination. any thoughts from anyone ?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
here are the signals i had yesterday: eur/jpy short usd/cad long usd/jpy short cad/jpy short gbp/jpy short sgd/jpy short of which i only entered two trades: eur/jpy and sgd/jpy. i came out of both the trades with + 30 pips on each one. total pips + 60. i didn't hang around for the trades to reach the psych tp's of 00 or 50. being a learner i couldn't afford to take any risks. do people agree with the above signals ? regards

--- 帖子 #250 ---
From my FX Accucharts screens, AUDJPY, EURJPY and GBPJPY (all shorts) are BIG winners today according to this strategy...huge pips!!

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Agreed, it's a good time to begin discussing the lousy risk/reward ratios we so often see when adhering to the basic rules. The basics of this system are clearly discussed in earlier pages for newcomers to this thread. I've been placing two psych level lines toward target on my charts and entering (on demo) with the nearest target phych at a minimum number of pips from entry. I'm beginning to get the sense that this minimum may be quite pair specific, haven't yet sorted that out. As the daily candle advances, I watch all pair crosses on the M5 (JPYs in today's case) even if they didn't signal, to get a feel for which psych target is likely to get hit. I try to keep greed at bay, keeping in mind that this system is not a grail. I made that mistake a couple days ago when PA hit the first target psych. That cost me 30, had to settle later for a BE.

AUDJPY, EURJPY and GBPJPY, usdjpy are just too much today. am using alpari.uk with london time. many xxxjpy moved over 250 pips today. initially didnt trade them on live because personally i have being on carry over tradesanddont want to risk more.As per TP/SL. if you are a newcomer, stick to demo, use physco levels relating to asharfs method,learn fibonacci retracement ,from monthly down to daily if you are trading on daily chat.then use your head most.support and resistance matters.Never trade against trend if you are new.it my be dangerous. i love simple system and i majorly trade trend on daily chats.it saves my time and give me more pips..ratio 2:1,3:1 as the case may be.

do you not come out of the trades once your tp is reached ? or do you adjust sl and continue with the trend ? if not, what is your method of taking all of the pips ?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Prospective buy signals on the USDJPY and CHFJPY as we enter the final hour. Any comments, opinions about these potential trades?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I can't believe it -- I sat on the sidelines as both pairs went to profit, "against all odds", so to speak. Horrible R/R ratio, trend defiant, you name it, no way Jose, but they worked. Go figure...

i went long on both of these pairs chf/jpy and usd/jpy yesterday. however they are currently running at a loss of - 30 pips and - 21 pips respectively. not sure if things will improve during the day, and iam thinking it could be a good idea to come out early ? yesterday my daily candles closed at midnight (gmt). i opened the trades at 00.001 i.e. i minute past midnight, effectively the following day. ia,m still confused as to when to enter trades as each brokers daily candles close at different times. perhaps ashraf could clarify ?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
could you please clarify what time of the day your daily candles expire ? and what time you enter these trades. regards

--- 帖子 #260 ---
hi guys......i like,this strategy......but what TP and SL should i put when i want enter the market??? Can anybody member here explained??

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hello azzenn, Welcome to the thread. To answer your question, please read post #1 and search the thread for the words "psycological" and "psych". You could even read the entire thread -- it is not too big. Regards

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thank's devogel...but i confius what mean 50&amp;00 to put TP and SL can you give me a detail what price should i put on TP and SL with 50&amp;00

--- 帖子 #263 ---
The strategy is sound but i think you got caught in the volatility caused by bad released data and apprehension about the one to be be released later

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I back-tested this method using the indicator going back on nearly every pair. This set-up appears to win no more than 50% of the time. It seems very difficult to make money with this win rate. Has anyone else back-tested the win rate on this method?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes. I have run many one-year tests using an EA. Some pairs do better than others. The EURUSD is about the worst with 50% wins on both longs and shorts. However, the shorts-only win rate is 78%. These percentages are based on trades with an average RRR of 1:1. The yen pairs do the best. The GBPJPY is the best pair I have tested so far. If you are not familiar with MT4 tester results data below, the basic info is: 36 trades in one year shorts win rate = 80% long win rate = 68% average win rate = 75% average RRR = 1 : 1.2 Testing GBPJPY from 2009.07.26 to 2010.07.24 ---------- Bars in test 1265 Ticks modelled 23393008 Modelling quality 90.00% Mismatched charts errors 0 Initial deposit 10000.00 Total net profit 973.14 Gross profit 1363.26 Gross loss -390.12 Profit factor 3.49 Expected payoff 27.03 Absolute drawdown 56.24 Maximal drawdown 162.96 (1.52%) Relative drawdown 1.52% (162.96) Total trades 36 Short positions (won %) 20 (80.00%) Long positions (won %) 16 (68.75%) Profit trades (% of total) 27 (75.00%) Loss trades (% of total) 9 (25.00%) Largest profit trade 83.79 loss trade -67.72 Average profit trade 50.49 loss trade -43.35 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Thanks for the statistics. So basically what you are saying is that the most favorable pair- gbp/jpy- showed a return of 10% for the entire year from 7/09-7/10. A profitable return is always good; however, 10% return for an entire year is just not that exciting unless you are trading with millions.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hello finally, I have not yet coded money management into the EA. Consequently, the 36 trades were a fixed lot size of 0.10. However, some profitability conclusions can be projected. The average money management risk for the statistics above is 0.5%, far below the normal trader's risk tolerance. If we use a more typical 2% risk on a $10,000 account and multiply by the profit factor of 3.49, we can project a one year profit of $13,500. Regards

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I have only tested 3 of 5 yen pairs. GBPJPY shows best so far. I coded money management risk into the EA, not an activity I prefer on a sunny Sunday morning, but... One year back test results on GBPJPY, 07/09 to 07/10 with 2% MM risk: trades = 36 win rate = 75% profit on $10,000 account = $4300 These tests are conducted using only Ashraf's basic rules, with the following two refinements: - On the GBPJPY, TP and SL phych levels must be 20 or more pips from entry. If either is closer than 20, that phych is moved to the next psych level. - Again, on the GBPJPY, TP and SL are shifted 5 pips off psych opposite the direction of the trade. This permits hitting target just before price reaches the psych, and requires price to penetrate psych before taking a loss. Each pair seems to exhibit its own preference for these two refinements.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
ok. my chf/jpy and usd/jpy trades of friday. both pairs went against and i was at a loss of about -70 pips in total. luckily later during the day the markets reversed back and went up. i was able to come out at break even. although both the pairs did go into profit eventually by about 22 pips each. so far so good. overall balance still up.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
i feel that with a lower TP and a higher SL, the results can be vastly improved ? you may wish to backtest at a TP of 30 pips and SL of 100 pips and see what you come up with ? regards

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll put that on the coding list along with several other things I want to try. Meanwhile, perhaps you can try manually back testing your suggestion on the GBPJPY to get a sense of whether or not it works.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Once you set your tp at the psych level, you stick to it. So if it is hit, you are out of the trade

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Thanks. I am just a learner (trying to survive in this jungle)

--- 帖子 #274 ---
whatfx, Here are your test results using TP 30 and SL 100: Testing GBPJPY from 2009.07.26 to 2010.07.24 using TP=30, SL=100 and 2% risk of $10,000 account balance ---------- trades = 36 in one year shorts win rate = 90% long win rate = 88% average win rate = 89% net profit = $1600 (16%) The win rate looks great, however, the three big losses cost us dearly because the average R/R ratio is 3.3 : 1. Also, with a fixed TP and SL, we have lost the advantage of support and resistance provided by psych levels.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
thanks for the info. however, for a reversal system, it might not be appropriate to set TP:SL = 3/10. on the contrary, you should try at least 1:1 something, and did you try this: set NO TP, and watch the green line's movement (floating equity), you'll be shocked...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
can we not have a EA to test this ? manual testing is laborious and prone to mistakes. i appreciate your effort for testing this, we get more confidence in the system now

--- 帖子 #277 ---
charvo, Thanks for your suggestions. And back testing proves you're right for the most part. At the expense of going far off topic, RRR around 1:1 is a definite improvement over 3:1 on the GJ but fails to pull the EU out of the mud. Your floating equity suggestion back tests truely a winner with Ashraf's candle pattern if a modest SL is imposed . After several trades the candle pattern entries align with the pair and profit about 100% per year. Even with the EU. Good call! Regards

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hello roundrock. Welcome to the discussion. And you are so right: manual testing is laborious and prone to mistakes. I will gladly post the EA, however, I have some uneasiness. Accurate back testing with EA has become difficult with MT4 History Center broken since March with huge data gaps. Using History Center data yields false results but does not tell the tester there is a problem. Some or many people will back test and discover false results because: - they do not have good price data for EA testing - their broker is not GMT+3 with daily candles starting at 2100 GMT People who genuinely know how to use an EA for back testing will understand when I say: - you must have good M1 data - must generate daily history from the M1 - must know the Strategy Tester limitations when testing on the daily TF Also, it is bad to clutter this thread helping people to learn back testing with EA. This EA is for experts who truely know what they are doing. Roundrock, I am hoping you are that valuable person. Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading my misgivings. Here is the EA next post.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I have not yet had time to see if the EA works properly with fractional pip pricing (5-digit brokers). It works fine on 4-digit brokers. Watch your tester log. If you find bugs, please PM me. Input parameters explained: - MinimumPsych minimum pips from entry price for TP &amp; SL psychs; if necessary, psych is moved 50 pips further away from entry - PsychOffset pips to offset TP and SL from phych levels; positive value offsets psychs opposite the direction of the trade, negative value offsets with direction of the trade; zero = no offset - Lots fixed lot size if Risk input is zero - Risk money management risk percent of account balance; 0=ignore and use fixed Lots input; example is 2 = 2% - BrokerUsesFractionalPips tells EA whether broker uses fractional- or whole-pip pricing - PrintRRR Print each trade's RRR to log and calculate averages Attached File(s) AshrafDailyCandlesEA_v1.12.mq4 13 KB | 661 downloads

Devogel/Charvo Hi Guys Can you pls elaborate for a sloe learner what you mean by floating TP? Thanks Gerard

--- 帖子 #281 ---
many thanks, devogel! i'll have some fun with it, i believe. and hey, i sincerely suggest you spare some efforts/time on backtesting, but use a few minutes demoing it. the reason is that this system is not a 5-min crazy scalping EA that requires sharp entry timing. so you might not have to spend too much time on those 1-minute data...... but demoing, and keep TP as '0' (or say, breakeven after 100 pips, lock 100 pips after 300 pips floating....) you'll see many losers, but every 10 trades, you'll have 1 or 2 winners that win you everything. i believe that within 1 month of demoing (on a few pairs), you can find this. really, this system let you catch some significant trend changes (from the very start of a trend change). demo 2 EA, maybe, 1 with a fixed TP, the other without TP......(when you have 500, or 1000 pips floating, you will decide then...)

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hello, I'm new to this thread. Found it yesterday and think it's interesting. Put the EA on an FXOpen (5 digits) demo (GMT+3). EA should have gone short on USDJPY, but no trade opened.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
drag a chart of major pair, eurusd or gbpjpy, use our human eyes, we can easily see that some entries, (if we allow them to develop) may bring in hundreds OR thousands of pips. these kind of entries happens on "trend reversal" followed by a breakout/trend change. sometimes, there is even no retrace after these entries, so why do we set a TP? we should let it run till next trend change. and "floating TP" means that if you do so above, you will see your equity is growing significantly(due to those positions keep growing profit), but "NOT realised", because you have not "taken the profit and exited the position".

--- 帖子 #284 ---
NederPip, Thanks much for your feedback. I also saw the same problem at beginning of candle with FXDD (5-digit broker) but EA did open the short on IKON (4-digit broker). I will solve the problem, test to confirm, then post a new version. Best regards

--- 帖子 #285 ---
That would be very nice, thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
hi not sure what you mean by all this ? (iam a newbie). can you explain.

here are the signals i got today on the majors usd/jpy short gbp/usd long usd/cad long eur/jpy short

i am using fxcm uk gmt+1, none of these are signals on my feed. yesterday body is not bigger than prev 2 bodies. i am not considering sunday candle

--- 帖子 #289 ---
There could be an indicator running on a one hour chart that would show the proper daily signals for people not GMT+3. The user would only need to input broker GMT offset. Anyone volunteer to code that indicator?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
This might be a repeat question but I was unable to find it in past posts. What platform are you using and what time does your day end..

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Iplus3, I like your screen name plus it sounds like you are a coder. Many traders here are using MetaTrader 4 but some are on other platforms. This thread's strategy stipulates that the daily candle ends at 20:59:59 GMT and begins at 21:00:00 GMT. Regards

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Thank you devogel. Thank you for response..

--- 帖子 #293 ---
This thread's strategy stipulates that the daily candle ends at 20:59:59 GMT and begins at 21:00:00 GMT. i missed this part, can you point me to the post please ? thanks

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hey guys, first of all, want to say thank you to all who contributes to this thread. But want to remind you, that this system/engulfing pattern doesn't apply exclusivelly to that specific GMT+3 time zone. It works anytime, anywhere depending on candle pattern (on Ashraf's system conditions from 1st post). Once again, thank you all.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
is that 21.00 GMT which is 22.00 london time ? but i think ashrafs daily candles expire at around 18.00 gmt ? out of yesterdays signals, i only entered short on eur/jpy. currently running at -40 pips loss. lets see what happens during the day.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
strange. iam based in london and iam in the same time zone as you. my daily candles expire at 23.59.59 gmt +1, and next daily candle opens at 00.00.01 gmt + 1. this is what i based my signals on. the ones i listed earlier. my broker platform is ig index.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
roundrock, Ashraf's daily candle times are discussed on post #40 : ashraff999 wrote, "I live in Saudi Arabia and the trading day according to FX Solutions starts at 9:00 PM (GMT)" and again on post #54 : webglobe wrote, "thanks for the time clearification.i assume you mean 21:00 GMT"

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Times are confusing. I struggled with it for two years until a 20-year veteran trader showed me the easy way: Go to http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/ and find the current GMT time. Click the button "Switch to 24 hour display" example: 13:23 GMT Look at your platform to find your broker's current time example: my broker IKON time: 16:23 Subtract the GMT hour from your broker hour example: 16 - 13 = +3 (my broker is GMT+3) ---------- Now, to find your broker day start time, understand 00:00 GMT is same as 24:00 GMT: subtract broker GMT offset hour from 24 example: 24 - 3 = 21 (my broker day begins at 21:00 GMT ---------- This method only works for MT4 platform during the trading week. On weekends the broker time stops updating. I don't know about other platforms.

well folks, the eur/jpy short position that i had open (according to yesterdays signals), has not done well. it was stopped out at -100 pips ! this unfortunately means that whatever profit i made in the trades from last week, are now completely wiped out with just one loss. iam in the black. beginng to doubt if this system really will work or not.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
better off shooting dice!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I am also seeing two black days with nine signals traded on demo. I try to keep in mind that this happens, even with strong trading systems. But yes, it is discouraging. Many traders see potential outside the basic rules. More discussion tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
i entered two trades last night. gbp/usd sell, and eur/jpy buy. the gbp/usd i got out at + 30 pips. and the eur/jpy is currently down - 60 pips. not looking very good. this system really needs to be tweaked, as on its own it does not seem to be working very well.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
i dont think every system will work on every pair. you need to do some kind of test/verification before taking trades. someone mentioned it gave good returns on gbpjpy with 30 tp, 100 sl, can you try this ?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi round i think 100 sl and 30 tp is not good @ all. riking too much for very little. can someone really trade that on real money?.plz just suggesting,no offence

--- 帖子 #307 ---
13:00 GMT Your most recent posts are very constructive. Searching for reasons why a trade is not working helps us tweak the system. And I agree with many traders' remarks that this system could benefit by diverging from the basic rules. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's the current trade Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's the bigger picture All comments would be welcome!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I am in the EJ short trade too and have been since Monday. At one point I was down 110 pips and am down 50 pips now. I am trading live on a small account with FXDD. As the big trend is down and the weekly trend is down, I am going to stay with the trade. I believe a SL of 100 pips trading on a daily chart is too tight. Just my 2 pips worth!

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Your "2 pips worth" is most appreciated and welcome here. Normally I would agree with your assessment of the SL as does Billy Williams who opines that such a SL leads to Death by a Thousand Small Cuts. However, the rules in this thread require us to close the trade before end of the daily candle, so it is a sort of semi-scalping system that signals on the daily. That may change as we explore tweaks to the rules. So, again, thanks much for your contribution, welcome in here any time, and many pips to you! Regards

well, here are the pips i made in the last two weeks trading this system: + 30 + 30 - 100 + 30 - 27 (today) so overall iam down by - 37 pips. surely this cannot be a winning system ? just like the two other system ashraf has posted which have now become defunct and non tradable, this one seems to be heading the same way. especially when ashraf seems to have dissapeared.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
To all traders still viewing, This post is a bit off-topic but seems fitting. I agree with recent posts that Ashraf's system has been thoroughly discussed and is not much of a winner when traded precisely by his rules. Thus, this post will likely be my last here. I've learned a lot in this thread thanks to many constructive contributors. IMO, Ashraf's candle pattern shows potential when used in other ways. A prime example is charvo suggesting and explaining "floating equity" on posts 275 281 &amp; 283. He generously followed through by providing an EA that supports his remarks. Pictures being worth thousands words, see the interesting tester graph below. I wish you all many pips as we go our separate ways, and look forward to exchanging ideas in other places.

from what i can see, although the pattern does often hold up, it does require discretion on the trader's part.

woaaah, why does the curve go so steep north at the end?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
is anyone still trading this system ? what results have you had ?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Yes, still playing with it, but ignoring a couple of the system rules. Use daily and 4H. Change money management to floating equity, and move the stops on winning positions. Too soon to assess results. no TP is a long term strategy. Looks promising. Here's a long, interesting read: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=245149

Do you think this set-up wins more than 50% of the time?

which system rules are you ignoring ? and what is floating equity ?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
no finally, the set-up I described does not work that way. 4H E/U one year back test results: ---------- Initial deposit 10000.00 Total net profit 19574.55 Profit factor 2.22 Total trades 248 Profit trades (% of total) 56 (22.58%) Loss trades (% of total) 192 (77.42%) Largest profit trade 2159.00 loss trade -120.86 Average profit trade 635.69 loss trade -83.46 ---------- The set-up stops out losing positions at a small loss, and retains positions that are winning.

Hi, Thanks for the strategy. Is it possible to apply on other timeframe , such as H1 ?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
thanks for ashraf999 I think, The combination of these strategies with sentiment index, give good results.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
hello everyone. is this thread still active? scalping with this simple strategy with camarilla is also a good one. time frame H1. but we have a candle formation wherein the first two bars up and the current is down with big body but not close below low of first bullish bar. and we have calculated the body size in pips. if we add the two bullish bars = 17 pips and the body of the third bar is 19 pips. therefore we have big body. but still we need confirmation after the big body or the 3rd bar because price did not close below low of first bar. with camarilla levels price of the 3rd bar touched the sell zone with rejection that is why we have 3rd bar with long wick above. this set up was in the exact rule with 3rd bar has a big body. after the 4th bar close we enter the market (sell) with target profit L3 of camarilla level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) then... profit target hit L3 camarilla level Attached Image (click to enlarge) and currently hit L4 Level as of 12/08/2024 Attached Image (click to enlarge) pair: BTC timeframe: H1 order: short /sell trading method: scalping risk: 0.5% (up to ~2.0%) of account balance stoploss: camarilla level H3 lotsize: as calculated with risk and stoploss target profit: camarilla levels L3,L4,L5,L6 executed entry as shown in image Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #335 ---
follow up update in H1 BTC with camarilla, hence we have weekly taken the sell side liquidity, and as to daily we have the set up 3rd bar with big body size. the question is , which trend we go? or what order type are we going to execute? we have narrow after two days ago formed the set up with big body. sell at sell zone with camarilla. if still a narrow in H1, do again the sell entry at sell zone H3(H4) or sell zone below L4 for another sell entry. TP? you may follow the rules or make your own rules. or you may target the recent swing low of daily or the close of the bar has the recent swing low. stoploss in H1 at H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #336 ---
in this set up as long as the body is big than the previous two bars, even if not close above previous highs, still a valid set up.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i concluded that the set up is concrete if we use other confluence to avoid false signals. because some valid set ups are resulted in a loss, if we are using swing trading, you can use stoch in daily and camarilla in H1. use only narrow range levels. for scalping, you can use stoch again (5,3,3) for entry and exit at overbought or oversold vice versa. stochastic at oversold with the setup BUY, and stochastic overbought with the setup SELL. with camarilla levels for the target profit. and make sure its narrow day. because this is the day where the manipulation and sometimes distribution occurs. we have signals as an example. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) i used stoch 5,3,3 and divergences to filter out the concrete signals in order to avoid bad trades.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
scalping in H1 with the following: 1. divergence 2. the setup signal in narrow day (SELL) 3. tp as shown in image. and WIN. Attached Image (click to enlarge) what if theres no divergence? if the setup occurs in narrow and it is likely to happen with stochastic then go for it. and my apology to everyone , especially to the author of this thread for violating the thread name by mixing other confluences. it is up to the eyes of others to use it or make it more concrete by adding some tools with their trading. good luck to everyone. hope you have learned something.

Whole level, half level, and quarter level refer to price levels. For example, the current USDJPY price: 141.000 (Whole Level), 141.500 (Half Level), 141.250 (Quarter Level).
