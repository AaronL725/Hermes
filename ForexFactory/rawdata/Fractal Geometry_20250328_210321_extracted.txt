EDIT 6/13/23: I've restarted this thread now that I have some free time. Making videos is an easier way to communicate the strategy so feel free to check my Youtube channel. As time permits, I will be making more and more videos showing examples of what works and what doesn't. Soon I will also be live streaming on Sunday nights to go through some potential trade setups for the upcoming week. In the meantime check out this video explaining the basic strategy: Inserted Video Hello traders and welcome to the thread. This strategy is based on fractal geometry for lack of a better term. It might sound complicated but it's really quite simple and elegant in its application. (At least I think it is). My system provides a stress-free mechanical way of looking at price action. We use manual drawing in conjunction with a modified fractal indicator. I prefer a clean chart and a clean heart. The sole intent of this thread is to build a community of hard-working productive pip harvesters. Period. Rules: #1) Political/Ideological arguments will not be tolerated here. #2) Rudeness, racial slurs, or vulgarity will also not be tolerated here. Disclaimer: I t's assumed that individuals are responsible for their own actions. My live trades are not recommendations, they are solely for the purpose of illustrating this system. Trading incurs risk and should be taken seriously. It's advised that you test this strategy on a demo account. THE STRATEGY We use the " first touch" principle. This means we buy/sell based on the first touch of a fractal line. 1) Fractal lines are derived by using the midpoints of impulse waves. ***** The modified fractal indicator is the basis for these derivations ***** Before discussing certain rules I think it's best to post a couple of examples for visual reference. Of course, these are cherry-picked to illustrate the strategy and to make it easier to understand these simple derivations. CAD/JPY 1H CHART ILLUSTRATING THE FRACTAL DIAGONAL LINE DERIVATION. Attached Image (click to enlarge) USD/CAD 4H - ANOTHER EXAMPLE Attached Image (click to enlarge) RULES/OBSERVATIONS #1) Fractals A, B , C, and D must be alternating highs and lows and vice versa. #2) Major fractals are better than minor fractals but both are valid. Fractal D is the completion of our structure and can only appear after the 7th candle close (minor fractal). Major fractals appear after the 12th candle close. #3) There can be NO other fractals between AB, BC, or CD #4) We are looking for "uniform" impulse waves. We don't want to see messy, jagged price action between our fractal points. #5) When fractal D appears we can then draw our structure. At this point, we want to see "price separation" from our fractal line (FL). #6) Be EXTREMELY accurate in your drawing making sure your fractal line goes perfectly through each impulse wave midpoint. Entries are everything and can be remarkably different if the drawing is inaccurate. #7) Note that some brokers use New York candle close time and some don't. Also, different spreads may affect when or if a fractal actually prints so you can get different structures or no structure at all for the same pair. The theory is still valid as long as you are consistent with your drawings. #8) You do not have to buy/sell the first touch. If you feel that there is too much fundamental momentum when price is approaching your fractal line, then you can wait to see if price breaks through your fractal line with a convincing candle close past that line. Then you can buy/sell the other side of the line upon the first retracement back to the line. In essence, this would be like a trend continuation trade. #9) We aren't trying to predict some big trend change. We are scalping fractal lines using higher time frames. #10) Don't hesitate to enter a bit early with a FOMO trade. Maybe one entry a few pips before the line and one on the touch, then take profits on one early and let the other run if it's going in your favor. Be creative with your micromanagement.

This strategy can be used on any pair. I find it works best for me on 30M, 1H, and 4H time frames. For pairs with a large average daily range, I will sometimes consider a 15M time frame. What makes a good potential structure? I've found that the most important quality of a good structure is to have impulse waves that are fairly uniform and that are not too close together, not too short, not too long. There can be no other fractals inside any impulse wave. The structure consists of 4 fractals. The fractals can be minor or major. Minor fractals have a period of 7 candles. Major fractals have a period of 12 candles. I suggest scouring your charts and looking for some nice even impulse waves and then drawing your structure to see what happened. After a while, finding these simple structures will become very easy. How to set SL/TPs? This is a personal choice but this is how I do it. I use a percentage of the 20-day average daily range (ADR indicator). For example, let's assume our pair has a 20 day ADR OF 100 PIPS. M30 CHART: SL = 10-15% of 100 pips = 10-15 pips TP = 20% of 100 pips = 20 pips H1 CHART: SL = 15-20% of 100 pips = 15-20 pips TP = 30% of 100 pips = 30 pips H4 CHART: SL = 20-25% of 100 pips = 20-25 pips TP = 40% of 100 pips = 40 pips In this way, I can figure out my risk management parameters in advance and have them set in stone before the trade activates. This is only a general guideline. Each trader and each trade is unique so be creative and tailor your risk management in a way that works for you. What if my trade gets stopped out? No problem assuming you have used prudent risk management. If my trade gets stopped out, it tells me that price has strong momentum. If my trade was a sell of the first touch and I get stopped out, I just wait for a retrace back to the fractal line and buy on the retouch of the same line. And vice versa. ******************************************************************************************************************

Hello friends! Always interested in graphical trading methods. And finally, a new interesting method. Thank Expo33! I drew a little and experimented with lines. The results are interesting, I think) These experiments:

Hello well72. Welcome here and thanks for posting and for using the template. Your drawings are correct for the system. However, to keep it simple for everyone, we stick to the two basic methods (if you could keep the clones out of the drawings it would make everything neater and simpler to analyze, especially for anyone new to this type of method.) To be clear as to how we should post, I'll use the GBP/AUD chart. Well spotted!!! I'll put it on the watchlist for tonight. Thanks for saving me time scouring the charts! A nice clean structure with uniform waves with nice spacing and form. GBP/AUD 1H DIAGONAL FRACTAL LINE (valid and waiting to buy on the first touch) Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/AUD 1H TRIANGLE WITH CONVERGENT HORIZONTAL LINE (valid in 34 hours after our triangle converges at X) Attached Image (click to enlarge) All we do now is wait. We remain aware of the fundamentals/news events, etc. Fundamentals, order flow, dynamic traders, manipulation may all be drivers of price but we don't try or need to predict price movement. We only need to have our structure in place. Then we are ready for the first touch.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
From our watchlist, we didn't buy the first touch of structure #1 as it occurred right around the daily reset time where spreads widen considerably. Interestingly enough, a second structure developed at that time so we waited until liquidity picked up enough to tighten the spread. Price ended up on the sell side of structures 1 and 2 and so we initiated a sell. Updated chart from our watchlist below. We aren't looking for huge moves. Risking 13 pips to win 19. Kind of a scalping method for higher timeframes but can be used as a continuation trade. EUR/JPY 30MINUTE CONFLUENT DIAGONALS Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, Expo33 First of all, thanks for interesting idea. How long is valid our projected entry line...till new set up appear or other..? And some of mine entries if I am understand correct them..

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Expo33 interesting Thread. My compliments. But I donn't understand well when at Touch I CAN BUY or I CAN SELL. Can you please explain better with trades as example and pertinent scrrenshots. Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Gleam. Welcome and thanks for posting. Your charts are all perfect and you make some interesting points that I forgot to put in the first post. How long is an untested line valid? Theoretically, forever. However, I find that the longer it takes to test a line the less chance it has to be successful. Having said that, I find that steeper angled lines have a better chance of succeeding because the price has to travel further and further to reach that line. What do you do when the 7th candle close is near or on the line? Another excellent question that I forgot to address on post #1. I originally never traded in that situation unless there was a distinct price separation from the line. I'm still observing that situation and it seems that it may be profitable to buy/sell whatever side of the line the 7th candle closes on. Still a work in progress. In looking at you're charting, all correct. Using the 20% of the 20 day ADR for a stop loss principle, you're EUR/JPY AND USD/CHF would have initially held up with that size stop loss at least giving an opportunity to take some pips or move to break even before the line eventually was broken. Your AUD/CHF structures are both valid and the first touch sell worked perfectly and would have been a nice winning trade with full TP. Breakfast time here, back soon. Well done you are right on point with your structures and questions. I'll try to update the first post to address those issues I forgot about. Cheers.

Hi rosone and welcome here. I have added some rules/comments on post #1 From post #1. I'm not sure I can make it clearer. Just keep looking at the new posts that have examples and hopefully it will become clearer. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #10 ---
UPDATE #1) I have decided to keep the triangle horizontal line theory out of the thread to make things simpler. That way we can focus 100% on fractal lines derived from impulse wave midpoints. #2) We scrapped the watchlist on post #1 as it will be easier to post the setups we are watching on the thread on a daily basis anyways.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks, and keep going. I like Geometry.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Here is an example that has very short impulse waves that I normally don't like to trade. Also, there is very little price separation when fractal D appears. However, it illustrates the very nature of our fractal line which theoretically describes the plane of price action going forward.

Done trading for the day as the daily reset is near. I will post some new potential setups later for tonight's action. Please don't hesitate to post any setups or ask questions. No question is stupid and every question helps me be accountable and get better as a trader and as a person. It also helps us all learn when we consider different viewpoints. Also added rules/comments to post #1 and will add/update as I remember any other important points. Always a work in progress with everyone's help.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Another interesting illustration. As I said in post #1, I generally only look at the 15-minute time frame for pairs with the biggest ADRs. In this example we see a few things: #1) Fairly uniform impulse waves. Nice spacing and roughly parallel #2) Four major fractals #3) Good price separation when D appears This structure developed several hours before a major fundamental news event. The RBA rate statement. As retail traders, we don't have the advantage that insiders do neither can we predict fundamental outcomes. Dynamic trading entities may be the market movers and may have inherent order filling advantages during major events but that doesn't matter to us and it doesn't preclude us from being successful. Check out the chart and my little commentary. Hopefully, you can glean something useful from this setup. EUR/AUD 15 MINUTE CHART Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Watchlist for tonight There are setups all day every day. We don't need to trade everything we find. Maybe there are some other confluent factors that you like to use. Just have the structure in place so you are ready for the moment. These two pairs have been inversely correlated on the hourly for this week so if price is about to touch one FL make sure to check the other chart first.

Hey there friend. You're welcome and good evening in Lithuania. I live on the west coast USA. Possibly the worst time zone to live in to be a trader. I should move to Lithuania. London open is midnight here and I sleep like 9:30pm to 4-5am and like to do a home workout when I get up. Also raising and homeschooling my 9-year-old daughter myself. I miss so many setups overnight that's why I need the EA to buy/sell the trendline touch. Still looking for a better one. 730am now and liquidity will dry up for the day in a few hours. Still, many good setups happen when I'm sleeping. Both are valid. In the first example the 7th candle closes near the line and the first impulse wave AB is a bit messy. I wanted to use a nice clean example with price separation for the first post. The second one is completely valid as well. Not the cleanest structure however as the first impulse wave AB is pretty messy. I only drew the most recent structure as that is the one that will be tested first. I also didn't want to confuse people initially until they got comfortable with drawing a single correct structure. Here is that USD/CAD chart with a new fractal giving the most recent setup which of course was a nice winner that I missed while I was trying to be Arnold Swcharzenneger this morning USD/CAD 1H CHART (FIRST TOUCH SELL QUICKLY DROPPED 30 PIPS) Attached Image (click to enlarge) From last night's watchlist, another nice easy winner. Unfortunately, the EA didn't buy as price was 2 pips from touching the line. If was awake I likely would have entered manually. Sometimes when using the EA overnight I'll move the line parallel a few pips just to get in a few pips early so I don't miss a trade.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
One thing I like about this strategy is that even if price doesn't reach the full the TP it usually "pops" off the line a little bit initially so you can move the SL to break even if you want. Looks like price moved up about 18 pips on this trade before retracing back down so you get to take partial profits if you want. At least you get the option to micromanage.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Another scenario. In this one, the first orange structure would have been a loser as price blasted upwards through the line. I think this corresponded with the much better than expected NZD employment numbers. The second and most recent blue structure is still valid and untested. Notice how close the lines are to each other. For me, this shows a nice harmonic relationship between all of the impulse waves involved and makes buying the touch a strong option to trade. Even if the lines aren't as close, many times it gives us a small zone to buy/sell from.

Hi, thanks for adjustments...You are welcome to Lithuania . I myself have three little daughters...and I know responsibility very well. Yah some good setups caught today.

Hello sanaullah79. Welcome and thanks for posting. You have the idea correct as to where we would want to sell, however, the structure isn't valid according to rule #2 on the first post. #2) There can be NO other fractals between AB, BC, or CD Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS. It doesn't mean that it won't work it's just not how I tested this strategy or how we will do it on this thread. Cheers

You are officially an expert fractal geometrist!!! Yes, I agree, the entries can be very precise which allows for a small stop loss. Thanks for the link to the EA. Wow, from 2007. I'll check it out later to see if it still works. This is the one I'm using now. I paid $30 for it a couple of years ago but it doesn't have the option to move SL to BE for a selected number of pips. The owner made a new one with that option but it's defunct and he hasn't shared the source code otherwise I could ask someone on the platform tech to modify it. I'm sure it's not hard for the pro coders. I don't know if it's ethical to share a paid version of an EA but this is the one I'm using now.

Thanks, friend. I went back to the thread and saw the rules. I'm not sure how I missed that. Interesting that it has the same issue as the one I'm using now. If you put the SL or TP at like 20 it actually sets it to 2 pips. Not sure if that's because of 5 digit brokers but no big deal. If I want a SL of 20 pips I have to set it at 200. Same with all of the functions, just have to add another zero. It has the BE and TS function which is really important for me since I'm usually asleep when orders get activated. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Going to have to start using the new EA and entering a couple of pips early. Order missed activation by about one pip. Small ADR for this pair, easy 12 pips missed. Still, nearly 48 hours after the structure appeared, we got a perfect entry point. NZD/JPY 1H CHART Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi,Expo33 I talked about the EA to open position at TL and I'm glad you found the rules how to use it. EA works perfect for me. I think It has everything we need unless I would add EA working time to avoid big spread when daily opens. I had opened some positions with GBP pair and NEWS burned all the gains Today. Lesson learned.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
And always Welcome to Lithuania !!

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks! I know it's the middle of the night there. I'm wondering when you use the EA do you have to add an extra zero for your values too? Like if I want a 20 pip SL I have to put in 200. If I want it to buy 3 pips before the line I have to put in 30. It's the same for the EA I'm using now. Like I said in my earlier post, I'm not sure if that's because of a 5 digit broker or what the reason is. Rest well........

USD/CAD sell is still on our watchlist. In the meantime, a buy structure developed on the 30 minute. From a fundamental perspective when oil and equities are rising and USD/CAD is also rising then that tells you that the US dollar is bid for now. If equities off and/or oil sells off too then USD/CAD will explode higher. But we aren't in that guessing game, we are in the structure in the moment.

Looking over a few of your charts. I think that you can use Andrews Pitchfork, base it on the first pair of fractals and line up the median line on the middle of the second pair of fractals. Sure solves the problem of where to start your pitchfork. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other stuff on my chart are the standard Bill Williams AO AC and Alligator. The symbol changer is great for checking through all your pairs for opportunities, but you can't run an ea on it . I took the liberty of attaching the symbol changer.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks Wab. Certainly accomplishes the same goal but it would likely bring in too many other questions about median lines and channels, etc etc. I wanted to keep it super simple and there's already enough good teachings/threads on pitchforks. A few years back I was engrossed in Tim Morge's work. I also spent some time lurking on your Chuvashova's Fork thread as well as Winston Reed's fork thread. It's what led me to this simple strategy. I've also used the symbol changer as well. Anyways, if traders can't draw a line through two dots then maybe trading isn't for them j/k. Cheers and thanks for dropping by. Appreciate the suggestion.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
For that NZD/USD all we are doing is looking to sell the first touch of the median line or as "fractal line", provided there was price separation when fractal D appeared as a minor fractal at candle #7. With the 20 day ADR being 57, we'd be looking for about 17 pips TP, SL about 12 pips. In and out and done with the structure Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Blue scenario stopped out, waiting for white ... mmm the question is how to choose the right one or which one is better in such cases? Yah .......or maybe the answer is in that "#1) Major fractals are better than minor fractals". White scenario has more major fractals... , just my thought..

Well done friend

Thanks for the confirmation. I'll practice on a demo today to make sure I'm 100% confident before I use it full time. I was wondering if I don't want a trailing stop do I set it to "0" or do I just delete it from the trendline description? Later today I'll just do a bunch of practice examples on a one-minute time frame.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I tend to stay away from structures where you have one wave so much longer than the other, especially if they are close together. Ironically one of my brokers didn't print the D minor fractal because their price on the 2nd candle was like a 1/10th of a pip lower. FRACTAL D Attached Image (click to enlarge) NO FRACTAL D Attached Image (click to enlarge) Which reminds me I'm officially done with Oanda after 14 years with them. My USD/CAD 30minute pending order filled when I was asleep. Oanda got stopped out by a pip or 2 while the other overseas brokers didn't. When I woke up for my workout at the wonderful hour of 3am the price had made it back to break even so I got out with no loss on the overseas brokers. I always felt safe and still do with Oanda as they have been in the game for over 2 decades and as a B booking broker, they have made massive profits and are highly capitalized so I feel my funds are super safe. Not to mention the San Francisco office is a 4hour drive from here. Makes a man feel good. And they weathered the Black Friday Swissy event with no problem. However, I just can't justify the less than competitive spreads and 50:1 max leverage anymore. Plus their finance/rollover fees are not very competitive either. Also, to illustrate the strategy with a $500 acct you can only open one trade at a time if you're risking 3% with such low leverage so bye-bye Oanda.

Thank you. I'll test it today and be ready to go full-time next week. Having the TS and BE options will help tremendously. So 10am your time is the London open? Wow, that is a dream come true for any full-time traders. Lietuva yra geriausia!!!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
A big thank you to all who participated in the first week of this thread. Looking forward to next week now that we have some of the basics down. Since there are 100s of valid structures every week we can be very selective in our trading and only trade the very best looking structures. Avoiding news events is also important with small stop losses. The old adage "less is more" certainly applies here. Also looking forward to using another broker and using a new EA for entries. Enjoy the weekend. I'll be posting some of the best structures I can find over the weekend and adding to post #1 if any new and useful observations come to mind. Cheers all!

Expo33 Thank you for the thread. How to draw correct lines and correct mid point please? Can explain that for correct drawings please. Regards,

--- 帖子 #74 ---
You're welcome. Read post one and look at all of the examples on the thread. The midpoint is set by the Meta4 platform. Draw a trendline on your chart, then double click on that line and it will show the midpoint. Then you can move the line where you want. Then double click on it again to lock it in place. Cheers

Hello traders. Hope everyone is well. I am now set up with a new broker with 200:1 leverage so I can open multiple trades on a small account. Still waiting on a response from FF as it won't connect to a trade explorer. Say the word "liberal" in the story comment section and your comment will be hidden in 3 hours. Need technical assistance with a trade explorer and you will wait 3 days to 3 weeks to potentially never. requested help 48 hours ago, no response yet. Set up trade explorer on Myfxbook but not sure how to link it here. Anyways, today is the first real money attempt at trying the new trendline EA so hopefully I'm using it properly. Have 3 on the watchlist ready to go. AUD/USD 30MINUTE Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZD/USD 30MINUTE Attached Image (click to enlarge) USD/JPY 30MINUTE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, Wish you many pip with new broker.. What is the weather in your place right now? We have a lot of snow and everything freezes. Thank you for updates .. will see how it works.. How do you make notes on the line?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Thanks friend. The NZD/USD and AUD/USD both filled overnight and were both winners. The notes on the line automatically appear when I set the order. I live in the desert so our winter temps range can be from -18 Celsius to 12 Celsius. In summer we have temps up to 40 celsius. I'm at 1400 meters above sea level. We usually get less than a meter of snow each year but I grew up in New York so I'm used to blizzards and colder temps for winter. 6am here and I'm behind my normal schedule. Workout now then to the store and then homeschool starts. Cheers

One more my entry, not perfect but price responds to such support. Will see how it ends..

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I like steep FL's because it takes a lot of price momentum to reach the line so I feel that price will be "exhausted" when it gets there and give a better chance for price to bounce off the line. Looks like it's run-up 20 pips so far. Nicely done and it gives you options to micromanage or book profits. That's the name of this game! Rest well my friend

Hello Express and thanks for posting. This is not a valid structure because the fractals must be LOW/HIGH/LOW/HIGH or HIGH/LOW/HIGH/LOW. I hope this helps

If you look at your setup, you have a Low/High/High/Low sequence ... which is not valid ... you must look at sequence with alternating High and Low ... not with 2 following Highs or 2 following Lows.

What is the reference point for this HIGH/LOW/HIGH/LOW or LOW/HIGH/LOW/HIGH? Your explanations are subjective please. I'm sure i'm not the only one confused here. Kindly help with a labeled picture examples. Thanks Ferrux ad Expo33.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Please label this abcd with HLHL or LHLH respectively.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Not subjective at all. The 4 fractals used as reference must be alternate from left to right ... either ... TOP then BOTTOM then TOP then BOTTOM ... or ... BOTTOM then TOP then BOTTOM then TOP The point is you can't have 2 following TOPs or 2 following BOTTOMs in the sequence

Got up at 4am and changed my trigger from buy 2 pips early to 0 pips trying to get the perfect entry and the order never filled. The other EA could be set to trigger on the ASK or BID price.

Hello Expo33, You have a great thread. Thank You for sharing your trading strategy. Your examples and explanations are very clear. Can you say who your new broker is? Also does the weekend effect the accuracy of your trading strategy. In other words if for example the AB line crosses from say Friday to Monday or the AB line is drawn in one week and the CD line is drawn in the following week will this be less reliable than if both lines are drawn in the same week? Cheers

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hello Tyrannosaur and thank you for the compliment. I don't think the weekend affects the strategy, however, I definitely like to wait for liquidity to pick up when the market reopens especially if there are any real price gaps upon the open. The new broker is FXchoice (not a recommendation but I've used them in the past). Unfortunately, I can't connect a trade explorer yet. Forex factory tech support said Fxchoice "throttles" their connections (whatever that means) and said I should just keep trying. I'm going to ask someone at Fxchoice and see what they say. Anyways, thanks for posting, and best of trading to you. UPDATE: Asked FXchoice chat dude if he could help me with the trade explorer issue and he asked if that is an EA or an Indicator . Pretty sad considering you actually have to set the investor password on their back office login. Anyways, he then suggested that it is likely my brand new lightning-fast computer (sarcasm) or maybe not enough memory or too many indicators on my chart or....... Basically, he had no idea what I was talking about. But then again why try to find another employee who knows what I'm talking about. I mean what broker wants free advertising with their name seen by others on the biggest forex site on the planet, Forex Factory. Anyways just wanted to vent. I withdrew my money and will put it on Coinexx (again, not a recommendation). Just waiting for the bitcoin to transfer, etc etc and then see if we can set up a trade explorer with them.

Green is better than red Still studying the theory. What works what doesn't. Looking at different filters, confluence, etc. One thing I noticed is when the 7th candle closes right near the line we have no separation so we have no trade. However, can we wait for price to break up or down and then buy/sell the retouch of the line? It seems that we can in many instances. Example GBP/CAD M30 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thinking out loud. Another theoretical situation. Can we buy/sell the retouch after a failed trade? A pretty messy structure that I cherry-picked as an example. NZD/USD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Daughter's turn at the dentist today. Back later with some more examples of trades that we can potentially initiate after our fractal line has broken. Rest well and be safe to our friends overseas and thanks to all of the posters here. We will continue to get better and hone our skills. Cheers

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The teeth of a child are very important! .......Yes, my friend, I turn my head too, and I try to filter out the best entrances. And with your permission I would add the following observation from myself. If price from second pair of fractals goes the same side of center line( not crossed our center line with first seven candles or more), likely to be good entry. Of course I can be wrong, but just thought and some examples from today trades. Good night from Europe.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Of course, you are always welcome to post your ideas. I place a high value on other traders' opinions and ideas. The best way to learn! I like your observation too. Here is the other situation where the price goes through the fractal line before the "D" fractal forms.(actually is can’t go through a line that doesn’t exist yet, no D no line) In this example, we would be buying the first touch. Clearly, there was some type of fundamental event driving price. In 4-5 hours, price goes up 80 pips then down 80 pips. But we don't try and predict short term fundamental outcomes, we trust that our valid fractal line has meaning and we trade around that line. Technically, buying the first touch would have been a losing trade. Although, if we look closely, price actually bounced up about 7 pips before reversing and breaking down below the line. Maybe we could have moved the SL to BE after 7 pips? Hmmmm......kind of early to do that with a more volatile pair. But that's not the point here. The fact that price initially bounced off the line (even if only 7 pips) tells us the line has some power (or has been validated as a good line) and now we can potentially sell the other side. My words maybe are confusing so I'll try to make it more clear on the charts. EUR/NZD M30 - THE STRUCTURE - THE TRADE - THE FAILURE Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUR/NZD M5 - A CLOSER LOOK.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I just thought of something. What came first the chicken or the egg? Can the 4th candle really cross a fractal line that isn't actually there yet? "D" doesn't appear until the 7th candle so there is no line to cross? Hehehe, you have price crossing imaginary lines . Just kidding, I know what mean.

I was having a hard falling asleep like something was bothering me so I got up and went into my home office and looked at the AUD/USD set up and I realized that I had set it for a "BUY" instead of a sell!! Anyways, I fixed it to sell and it triggered. Looks like it was plus 12 pips before reversing so I ended up getting stopped out at BE which is ok. I'm happy to have that EA with the BE function otherwise I would have had a taken a loss. I had it set to 9 pips for BE so it was a nice protection.

For such a small pip trade we will move or SL to 3 pips after a 5 pip bounce up off the line and let it go for now. After all, this is a quasi scalping method on higher timeframes. If we get an immediate bounce then we tighten up. If the line is broken after a little bounce it's likely going to reach our full SL anyway so let's limit losses as much as possible.

Yea, looks like my "C" fractal was during the first hour after the daily reset. Low liquidity with bad spreads causing the spike down so it wiped out the extra fractal that you have. I'm not impressed with Coinexx spreads on the cross pairs.

Hello friend. I like the double line confluence. If it reached that area, what a good sell trade it would be!

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Well, I've made this mistake before and did it again. Most of you probably know, and if you didn't, you have to redo your lines after the weekend because the meta4 platform moves the lines off of their original plane after the weekend because of the two missing days of price action. I forgot to update my charts and entered two trades, both losers, that weren't valid if the lines had been updated. Trading is hard enough without making such foolish mistakes. Shame on me! Anyways, we just had a trade trigger and here it is. GBP/AUD H1 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Good evening to everyone and especially to you Expo33. I wanted to ask you something... On the first page I read your explanations but maybe I didn't understand correctly: A and B must be separated by about 10/12 candles? and so also, C and D must be separated by at least 7 candles? and then, how do you distinguish a buy from a sell? depends on point D? whether it is down or up with respect to C? Thanks for your answer

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hello cinciri99. The 7 and 12 are how many candles it takes to form a minor or major fractal. The fractal indicator that comes with the Meta4 platform makes fractals with a period of 2. The modified fractal indicator that I use has the ability to adjust the period to whatever you want AND to have a major and minor fractal. Note the settings for this indicator: Attached File(s) lastmanstandingindicatorv11.ex4 12 KB | 339 downloads Attached Image If you use the fractal indicator from the Meta4 platform the chart would look like this which I find is not useful. Here, a fractal forms with only 2 candles on either side of the high or low price. EUR/USD M30 Attached Image (click to enlarge) When I mention "price separation" on the 7th candle close, that is ONLY referring to the "D" fractal because we can't draw our structure until "D" appears. And "D" only appears as a minor fractal after 7 candle closes from that high or low price. It may become a major fractal if we get 12 candle closes below/above but it doesn't matter. We have no structure until that 7th candle closes and meets the requirements of what it takes to form fractal. Then, we are buying if price is above the fractal line AND price is separated from the line and selling if price is below the line. But we don't know where price is until "D" forms after the 7th candle closes. I hope that helps

Sorry to turn this into Expo's "searching for an overseas broker" saga BUT I just deposited with LMFX (not a recommendation). They accept credit cards too which is fantastic. No need to send Buttcoins all over the world waiting and waiting for clearance. They charged me NO fee for depositing AND I got an immediate email requesting the "selfie with credit card pic". NO problem. I sent the pic and they verified it in 10 minutes. BOOM!!!!

UPDATE: Terrible spreads!!! Bye Bye LMFX. Wow, all these brokers advertise such great spreads, not even remotely competitive. Back to Oanda . I can at least click a button and funds are deposited instantly and the spreads are actually far better than all the others I tried. Like a hamster running in the wheel.

Ok, I'm done whining about brokers and now.................. Inserted Video EUR/USD M30 Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think 20% of 20 ADR for SL may be too big for the 30-minute time frame in general. Personal preference for each trader.

Thanks for your reply, however in post 164 between AB there are fewer than 12 candles and between CD even less than 7, I realized that after the fractal "D" it is necessary to wait for the closing of candle n. 7, see the deviation from FL and then enter the market. Here, the only thing that escapes me is how to build AB and CD which is very fundamental, I think. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #176 ---
You're welcome. I'm not sure you understand how and why a fractal is formed. It doesn't matter how many candles are "between" point A and point B, it only matters that from the high price at A that there are 12 candles that closed below that price on both sides of point A (major fractal).

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Perfect, now I definitely understand, Thank you very much

Hi, traders Some of my entrances...today.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Morning friend. Is it true that the charts need to be open for the trendline EA to trigger because I had my charts closed during sleep time and my GBP/CAD never triggered? Usually I have the charts open because when I get an alert on my phone when sleeping I can get up and go in my office to do what I need to do and it saves time if the charts are already open but last night I forgot and had them all closed.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I'm glad to hear that.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yes, bro, of course you should leave it opened if you want EA do its work. I kept closed my MT4 overnight usually because of big spread at open new day. My broker IC Markets and spreads are very useable there.. You can try, my friend .

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Thanks that kind of what I thought. I think I tested IC on demo a few years ago. By the way, thanks for the EUR/NZD set up, I manually scalped 4 pips then got out Unfortunately, no brokers in Australia accept US clients.

Hello friend. It looks like your CAD/JPY was a full TP winner! Congrats. And the CHF/JPY looks like it is still alive for now. I don't think I would have taken the CHF/JPY just because the CD wave is really really messy. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
UPDATE: Our USH/CHF sell triggered during my sleep and was stopped out. One good thing about Oanda is they have their own mobile app that has audio alerts so I heard the stop out in the middle of the night and got up and placed a "recovery buy" on the other side of the fractal line and got back 10 pips. USD/CHF Attached Image (click to enlarge) Our EUR/USD buy triggered during the big US retail sales print which is inherently dangerous with such small stop losses. We got stopped out there as well and now we have placed a recovery sell trade on the other side of the fractal line.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Nice job! It looks like you are in profit on both. In both cases price followed the line before breaking which "validates the line. Wait for the break and sell/buy the retouch. That's fantastic. Also, I'm sure you know EUR/USD and USD/CHF are inversely correlated (move in the opposite direction) so really you could make your EUR/USD trade twice as big and not do the USD/CHF trade and save yourself a lot of extra margin as CHF pairs require a lot more margin. Especially for any traders using US brokers that only have 50:1 max leverage. Also, Australian brokers won't service any US clients which is a shame because I like several brokers in Australia. I'd use Global Prime in a heartbeat if I could. Cheers and thanks for posting My EUR/USD "recovery" sell trade missed triggering by 1 pip but it shows the power of the fractal line.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I agree brother. One thing I know is that if you don't trust the system then it really doesn't matter if it's good or bad. I usually don't do well on Friday so last night when I posted and entered into the USD/CAD sell trade, I ended up taking like 2 pips profit because I was going to bed and didn't want to have a bad taste in my mouth when I woke up. When I woke up at 4am the trade sold off like 70-80 pips . It was a very nice uniform structure that I didn't trust. I believe fewer trades per week = more profitable but I tend to overtrade like a lot of people. Anyways, we're done for the week and next week we will look for only premium structures. A trailing stop and some trust and this could have made for a big trade. USD/CAD M30 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes, you are absolutely right...two or three of good entrances would be enough a week to become successful ..Have a good weekend!

Hello traders. Super busy day, no time to post until now. Hope you all had a nice weekend. I've been hesitant to add another twist to the thread but here it is. I have always been fascinated by the wickless chart, particularly the 4H time frame. For this method, I will only use MAJOR fractals. We can connect two wickless points that correspond to the two fractals and then buy/sell the next touch. It's very simple and similar to what we are doing but remember I do this ONLY on the 4H time frame and ONLY with major fractals. Some examples below with their corresponding regular candle chart. NOTE: EUR/USD is a New York candle close broker while the GBP/USD and SILVER are not so you will get a different-looking chart. As long as the method and drawings are consistent it should be effective.

It really has nothing to do with our traditional fractal structure so it doesn't matter if there are other fractals in the impulse waves. I probably should call it a "wickless trendline" because it's not really a fractal line. The only rules are it must be 2 major fractals AND only on the 4H timeframe. I just use the two wickless points that correspond to the two major fractals, if that makes sense. GBP/USD H4 - FINDING TWO POTENTIAL MAJOR FRACTALS Attached Image (click to enlarge) DRAWING THE WICKLESS TRENDLINE Attached Image (click to enlarge) SETTING THE ORDER Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I'm really looking for two major fractals that will produce I wickless trendline that hasn't been tested. So we want to buy/sell the first touch after we find our first two points for our wickless trendline. Hopefully, that makes some sense. I also like to draw the traditional trendline using the fractals just to see if I can't use that as a reference for a stop loss or to see if I can use it as a "zone" for the buy/sell. For our example, we could buy the "zone" created by the green trendline and put a stop loss below. Maybe enter one order at the wickless trendline and one at the traditional trendline.

Good job friend. You're firing on all cylinders It could be because the system sucks or maybe because I'm not active at all when most traders are online. There may even be a little language barrier for some as I tend to speak a lot of English slang. I get up between 4am-6am and it takes me 2 hours to ice up and work out at home. Also, I have to get my daughter up at 8AM for homeschool so by the time I get online the trading day is pretty much over. London's session is over now and New York lunch break starts soon and liquidity will dry up for the day. I grew up in New York but moved to the west coast 20 years ago, truly the worst time zone to be a trader. So London forex open is midnight my time and New York open is 5am my time. I could get up at 3AM no problem, and I do many times but I need to work out first before I get any screen time. Otherwise, I'll be stiff and sore before my workout and I find as I'm older now that the screen time zaps my energy. Another thing is there are literally no US posters so most posters around the world are ending their day as I'm starting my day. I like the international flavor though, always have. Time to make breakfast for my little girl and then I'll have a look at some charts for tomorrow. None of my orders activated last night but like they say, "no position IS a position" Cheers and thanks for posting as always.

I see you're trading like a guru . Looks like your making it work for you! Just to break down that EUR/AUD trade. Even though it ended up being a loser which is part of trading, there was still the possibility of limiting any loss as the price did sell off initially about 14 pips. So you could move SL to BE. I'm not saying that you should have done that as 10 pips or so is kind of small to move to BE for such a volatile pair. But price did react at the line initially. But even if you didn't move to BE and took the full loss there is always the "recovery trade" on the other side of the fractal line. A look at the M15 chart just so everyone that's reading the thread can see what actually happened a bit more clearly.

Nice trading brother.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Well done brother. As long as we manage the risk each trader can find their own way of using this simple theory and be profitable over the long term. Yea, if I was at my computer when NFP was happening I might consider entering a manual trade because then I could see how bad the spreads were but it's too risky for me to let pending orders stay open while I'm sleeping. I got up at 3:30AM this morning and took partial profits on my EUR/NZD ( too bad because it eventually dropped 100 pips ) and cancelled my pending GBP/AUD order then went back to bed for a couple of hours. But it was a good week for us and I'm really REALLY looking forward to next week because I'll be starting my 100K FTMO "portfolio manager" account. Oh wow that sounds impressive

As a huge fan of mixed martial arts and the UFC, congrats to Jan Blachowicz, the beast with the Polish power! He retained his light heavyweight belt last night verse Israel Adesanya, the "style bender" and one of the best technical strikers/kickboxers on the planet. Israel was 20-0 and the reigning middleweight champion and stepped up in weight class to try and win a belt in 2 weight classes. Not an easy task. Jan is a beast with explosive power in his hands.

It seems trail stop is not working on our EA, BE ok. Or I am wrong?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I see your trading style only with trend exactly match second type of trade I posted earlier. So You can use theorytically 10% ADR SL all the time.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Interesting concept. I tend to look at how much power it takes, or how long price has to go to reach the line. If the line is very steep angle and price has to go a long way to get to the line I will use a smaller stop loss. In general, I now have been using smaller stop losses, especially for M30 setups. Example: Price here still has about 140 pips to reach the line and has been as much as 200 pips below the line so if I use 30% of 20ADR for the H4 timeframe I get a stop loss of 40 pips. For me, that is too big of a stop. If price moves 140 more pips to get to this steep line then I think theoretically it should run out of energy before a 40 pip stop loss is hit. I hope that makes sense. But in any event, I think each trade is unique and each trader should have a unique way of setting and managing their trade. However, it is good to know what everyone is thinking. We all learn and grow when we consider other ideas. This line has an angle over 61 degrees. That's very steep!! Imagine hiking a mountain with this angle and then reaching the top. You would probably have no energy left when you reached the top. But maybe if the hike was only 30 degrees you could still go farther when you reached the top.

No problem my friend. It's your chart and my hope is that you are successful however you do it.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I entered manually on last night's trades so I set my trailing stops manually from the Meta4 platform but from my demo testing, the EA trailing stop function worked fine. Note: The trailing stop does not activate until you are in profit that is the same size as the trailing stop. For example: If you set your TS = 10 pips then the EA won't do anything or show up on your chart until you are in profit of 10 pips. When you hit 10 pips profit the trailing stop will appear 10 pips from that price level and will either stay at that level if your trade starts to move against you or it will move with your trade if it continues with more profit, always staying 10 pips from the latest price. Also, note that if you set your BE=0 and your TS=10 then as soon as the trade is activated the EA will automatically initiate the TS at 10 pips. EDIT: I just did some more demo testing and this is weird. When I did a buy with SL=20 AND TS=10 when the trade activated the SL instantly set at 20 pips on the chart as it should, but when I did a sell the TS apparently took precedence, and when the trade activated, there was no SL at 20 pips but only a TS at 10 pips. I think I'm going to ask someone in the platform tech thread to see if they can modify this EA. Maybe make the trendline description shorter and check into this TS thing.

Well, I made a request for help in modifying the EA. Here is the request thread if anyone cares to read it or add any other suggestions. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...e-modification

Thanks for clarify. I did not use trail but who knows maybe it will be necessary in future. It would be great to facilitate our work process. I would add that would be great that line has all.... stop, BE, Profit, lot... calculate depend on 20 day ADR automatically But good programmer is needed.

I always want to keep this thread simple and only about fractal lines. However, I also would like to share a couple of different ways I use these fractals. I've mentioned them before so I thought I'd post two live trades to illustrate. Ironically the triangle method led me to investigate the fractal line method. Trading the horizontal level of a convergent triangle and trading a simple wickless trendline GBP/CAD H4 TRIANGLE Attached Image (click to enlarge) EUR/CAD H4 WICKLESS TRENDLINE Attached Image (click to enlarge) And as I mentioned before I am using much tighter stops than the 20 and 30%. Either the line is like a brick wall or it isn't so I don't need to see price go through it that far to know it isn't going to work. At the very least if a candle closes above the line then in my mind it is a loser at that point. It may retrace a little back to the line to recuperate some of the loss but I'd rather trust the line and use smaller stops. Again, each trade is unique and each trader should have a unique and personal way of managing their risk. The percent of ADR's was just a general suggestion.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
As I have said before these are not recommendations. I am just sharing my personal trading journey. I have signed the contract with FTMO to manage a 100K account and am waiting for them to process the administrative stuff and then I'll get my login credentials. I am really excited and look forward to this new journey. They do have a thread with a representative in the commercial section. Also, as I mentioned in a previous thread, I started two more challenges with two more companies. The5ers ( also has a thread in the commercial section ) and City Trader's Imperium (no commercial thread) The5ers - you must earn 6% with an allowable drawdown of 4% and have 6 months to accomplish. For funded traders, you can double your account size by earning 10% in a month after you receive your account (not easy with only 4% allowable drawdown). Payout is 50/50 split, not the best. My progress - 40K CHALLENGE Attached Image (click to enlarge) City Traders Imperium - same requirement, earn 6% with 4% drawdown but you have 1 year to accomplish. However, funded traders can double their account for earning 10% BUT there is no time limit to do that. BIG difference. Payout starts at 50/50 and can go to 70/30 if you earn well for them. My progress - 50K CHALLENGE Attached Image (click to enlarge) Both have similar stop-loss requirements and max positions. However, both allow you to hold trades over the weekend and to trade news, unlike FTMO. FTMO has 70/30 payout and 10% drawdown so there is bigger potential in the short term, however, it is much harder to pass FTMO's challenge. 10% in 1 month , then to be verified 5% in 2 months . I hope FTMO allows you to trade news in the future because if you have a swing trade open and forget the news event and you hit a TP or SL within 2 minutes of the event, then you lose your account. Anyways, this is my experience so far. just thought I'd share it here.

Closed out all of our trades in profit and we are done for the day. Thanks to our posters here (all 2 of them ). You have inspired me to work harder and to be more accountable. This is the best I've traded in 14 years of forex. Cheers PS. It's been 24 hours with no response in the platform tech thread to modify our EA. Maybe, I will look to hire someone on the MQ5 site.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Wait a minute with posting advertisement for this EA. I need to look at this. I've been programming MQL a little. Maybe I could fix this and add Gleam suggestions.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Well you’re already working 12 hours a day

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Yes but only 15 days a month so I have some time left

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Ok so maybe I know where is the problem that nobody replied to Your request. This EA is in .ex4 format so we can't modify it without decompile it. Maybe we need to do this first but I don't know if it is legal thing. Propably not.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
It shows mq4 when I posted it in the platform tech thread and it shows mq4 from the author in his original thread so I'm confused. On my first post here it is in "ex" format because if I remember it didn't work so I tried to compile it and it had some errors but it worked.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Ok. In platform tech You posted mq4 version Now I can analyze this.

Fantastic! Thank you.

Asian session action (say that 10 times fast ) Two fractal lines are better than one? GBP/NZD H1 FRACTAL LINES IN CONFLUENCE Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also, I think this calls into question always using 20% of the 20day ADR. In this case, it would be 33 pips which for this setup is way too far past the fractal line to consider the trade still valid.

Who's ready for some theoretical nonsense. Fantastic! Let's do it! I call this THE DOOR PRINCIPLE. Where the door "hinge" represents our 4 fractal structure. (the fulcrum) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This principle makes sense for a relatively flat angled fractal line like in this example that we just manually entered. GBP/NZD H1 - FLAT FRACTAL LINE WITH PRICE VERY NEAR THE DOOR "HINGE" NOTE: For this example, if price blasts right through our fractal lines, then this theory is absolute garbage Attached Image (click to enlarge) But, I think it's different when our fractal lines aren't very horizontal. 1) Fractal lines moving towards price get weaker the longer they go untested because less price momentum is required to reach the fractal line. 2) Fractal lines running away from price get stronger because it requires more price momentum to reach the fractal line. In this example, we have our fractal line trending down towards price so it should require less price momentum to reach and then break through our line. AUD/USD M30 - FRACTAL LINE RUNNING TOWARDS PRICE Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this example, our fractal line is trending upwards and "running away" from price so it should be harder for price to catch up and break through GBP/JPY M30 - FRACTAL LINE RUNNING AWAY FROM PRICE Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hopefully, this makes some sense but I know it could just be my lunatic brain on overdrive

--- 帖子 #319 ---
So our line held up initially on our GBP/NZD trade, however, it eventually gave way and once we had a candle that closed above our line, no problem, we waited for a little retrace to end our trade and mitigate some of our loss. Then we buy the other side because we believe and trust that a broken fractal line means price has good continuing momentum. This is our recovery trade. GBP/NZD M30 BROKEN FRACTAL LINE RECOVERY TRADE Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now that we recovered our loss we notice a new fractal developed with some really nice and uniform impulse waves and 4 major fractals. GBP/NZD M30 FRACTAL LINE NEW BUY SETUP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #320 ---
There was a bug in this EA with TS. Buy and Sell conditions was different. When we use TS we need two parameters: - TS activate value (number of pips in profit to activate TS, it could be BE value for example) - TS step value (number of pips for SL to follow actual price) Now the question is how we want to solved this. Set TS activate value to BE value or add parameter TS activate value?

Hello brother. Personally, I think "TS activate value to BE value" is good. So for example, if I set BE to 10 pips, then if the trade goes into profit of 10 pips, then at that point the TS would activate for 10 pips and the BE would go away and the 10 pip TS would follow the trade? Is that correct? And thanks again for taking the time to work on this EA for us.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thanks brother. Yes both have fees very similar to FTMO. For City traders Imperium to buy a challenge for 50K account = 400 EURO For The5ers to buy a challenge for 40K account = 378 EURO

--- 帖子 #337 ---
You are the "trendmaster"

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I like the idea of a TS because I'm asleep during so many trades. Actually, I've never slept well in my life so I'm usually rolling around every 15 minutes checking my trades on my phone with 4 different brokers . So it makes sense to get up before the sun to lift heavy weights TS just gives us another way of managing a trade. Again each trade is unique.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks brother glad you got it too!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Funny, news good, news bad I have to be super careful of the news. If I open or close a trade within 2 minutes of a designated "news event" according to FTMO, then I lose my 100K account instantly. The challenge you can do whatever you want but not the funded account. Also can't hold over the weekend. I don't like those restrictions. The other two prop firms don't have those restrictions. Good day at work.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
You welcome.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes, this is the question: NEWS bad, NEWS good

--- 帖子 #343 ---
It can work whatever You like. My idea is: Starting parameters: TS 15 BE 10 Till our trade is less than 10 pips in profit (BE) nothing happen. When we reach our 10 pips in profit, SL is set to BE and TS 15 is activate. So TS will start to change our SL when price get to 15 pips of profit. I hope I wrote this clearly. TS is activate when price get to BE value in profit. Right now it is activated right after trade execution so even if You set your SL to 20 and TS to 10 then right after execution SL is change to 10 pips. After modification TS will be activated after BE is hit. You can of course set if whatever You like ie. BE 10 TS 10 so after BE hit the TS will be follow price by 10 pips. But if You set smaller TS than BE, it won’t be good because after BE is hit the SL will be automatically change closer to the price and not to open price.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi, traders. Just wanted to share my results for the last week. There were to many orders. But I have no idea how to filter the best ones. I took almost every setup from 28 pairs all week. Used H1, H4 two SMA 200 and 120. All triggers according trend. Working time from approx. London opening till 1.5 hr after New York open. I think I will continue to follow this strategy and will see.. Thanks again our Guru Expo33 .

--- 帖子 #369 ---
You're welcome brother. You're doing all the work, I just put up a simple theory. Nice graph! Up up up.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
The big question is how do we filter trades? As I said, I think each trade is unique and each trader has a unique way of seeing a particular structure and then determining if that structure is worth trading. Of course, it's important to be aware of the surrounding fundamentals in a general sense and to be aware of news events. However, I never believed in trying to predict news outcomes or to attach much meaning to fundamentals when using this system. We are in essence scalping or more appropriately, looking for intraday impulse retracements/continuations. So, I decided to put together a trading journal specifically for the fractal line setup. (No triangle trades or wickless trendline trades, but they can be used as a source of confluence and noted in the journal comments) Anyways, if anyone is interested in using the template, here is the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets...it?usp=sharing Here is a screenshot with some explanations below: Attached Image (click to enlarge) TREND Y/N - If the trend for the next two higher time frames is in the same direction you are trading, then Yes(Y ) otherwise No(N) . For example, if you are trading the H1 , then for your entry to be "Y" the H4 and D1 time frames must be trending up, otherwise your entry is "N" EXPAND/CONTRACT - If impulse wave CD is larger than AB then the structure is "EXPANDING" otherwise the structure is "CONTRACTING". BC LENGTH - Number of candles for impulse wave BC. PARALLEL Y/N - Are waves AB and CD approximately parallel then "Y" , if not then "N" Everything else is self-explanatory and of course, some of these entries can be skipped if they don't seem useful. I want to log 100 trades and then see if there is any pattern that appears as to which trades are better than others then I will share my results.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Although I haven't been stopped out yet, I consider this trade as a loser because the H1 candle has distinctly closed above the fractal line. As such, we will let the trade go and wait for a small retrace before initiating a recovery trade. Manual exit for a loss of 10 pips after a small retracement.

Hello traders. No positions for the rest of the day with FED funds rate decision, NZD gdp, AUD employment, etc. Back later for tomorrows watchlist Be safe , be well

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I've been waiting on this one all week. FED funds "kick the can down the road" cheap money decision helped to obliterate the dollar across the board. BUT, we don't care, we only care that the structure is in place. We wait like a hawk then we attack when the opportunity arises. Using a super tight stop for this pair and time frame. Risking 20 pips to win 50. GBP/USD H4 - FRACTAL LINE Attached Image (click to enlarge) NOTE: The green line is the fractal line that is produced by using the midpoints of the wickless points that correspond to our normal fractals. I find that have messy waves or large wicks tend to produce a wickless fractal line that is potentially very different than the normal fractal line. I don't like to trade those structures.

--- 帖子 #390 ---

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Good morning. Up very early today. Workout, then going hiking in the canyons to do some bird photography. No trading for me today. Have a good afternoon brother. I photographed this juvenile Cooper's Hawk that hangs out around my backyard. He waits and waits and waits and tries to eat the smaller birds that come to feed. Like a trader, when the moment is right he pounces!!! Too bad he never succeeds because I built a brush pile as an escape zone for my smaller birds when they come to feed . I would never want to set up the birds for failure. The hawk will find a meal elsewhere. Attached Image (click to enlarge) By the way, my name is Kurt and it's nice to meet everyone

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hello brother. Again, thank you for your effort. This indicator has great potential. I tested this indicator and here are my comments. 1) This example you posted is an invalid structure because of Rule #1 and #3 from the first post of this thread. 2) This indicator does not draw valid structures. For example, this is not a valid structure Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is a valid structure that I labeled and drew myself. ABCD, low-high-low-high with NO OTHER fractals on wave AB, BC, or CD as the rules state on post #1. However, if you use the indicator and pick any one of the 4 fractals, A,B,C, or D, it draws an invalid structure. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3) When you apply the indicator to a chart, it has the wrong setting for the fractal periods (major fractal =12, minor = 7). However, if the user corrects the settings and then applies the indicator to a template, it will keep the correct settings when that template is applied to the chart. Attached Image 4) If you change the color and the line thickness for the actual fractal lines in the settings, the indicator will not keep those settings for the user. For example, the fractal lines will always stay as thick white lines even if the user changes the color and thickness in the settings. Attached Image I hope that makes sense.

Hi, traders! Looks like it would have gone well if you had left, my friend ... Well but how we say in my country "better sparrow in hand than eagle in sky" Had small losing week -3.5 % .. Decided to look entries more selective.. ...will see..... Be all healthy and creative !!!

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Yes.. it was difficult week for trading... First my entry for today If candle will close below trigger line I will revert entry....be safe..

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Candle closed below triger line ...reverted trade .... I hope to cover the loss -3.9 plus two pip

--- 帖子 #413 ---
And bingo, traders!! This scenario has the power as previously was mentioned by Expo ... A few pip for profit and calm. If I had done like that in the past week, I would not have loss. Let's wait for the next one. Be all health and safe.

Risk 10 pips for 14 CAD/JPY M30 - FRACTAL LINE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Gave back my one winner on this dumb trade. Remember expo33, it's a FIRST TOUCH system, not a SECOND TOUCH system. Looking at the 5 min chart of that losing CAD/JPY trade the first touch already happened. price got within 2 pips of the line and bounced up 10 pips. So for me, 2 pips is close enough to consider it as a "first touch". The 10 pip bounce for me validates the line. Now, if we didn't buy that first touch, the only trade we potentially have left is to wait for the line to break and then sell the backside of the line.

Today's GBPUSD action. Great reffer to, what Expo33 and Gleam showed couple times. First buy on FL touch then sell after breakout. Attached Image (click to enlarge) M5 perspective: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Very important element about this system because in my opinion we will be have many of this type trades and we need to maximize profit.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
This is tough one. Candle close perfectly at FL. When do You think to enter short trade? At the retrace to FL? You already loss full SL so the risk on recovery trade is high.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I've noticed you guys are trading the "second" touch sometimes which is fine but I personally am very worried about that for my own trading. I feel like the more price knocks on the door, that eventually the door will open and price will break through. Also, as I have said, I have been using much smaller SL's, especially for M30. In this case, 20% would be 14 pips which for me is just too big. If price runs past the line 7-10 pips then in my mind it's going to be a loser anyway. It seems to me that the first touch, when it works, reacts immediately and forcefully at the line so a smaller SL seems better to me. Also, a smaller SL gives you the opportunity to make a profit overall if you can be successful with a recovery trade. Instead of just "recovering" that 14 pips we can use a smaller SL and make a little profit even when our initial trade was a loser. I have also been targeting 20% TP for M30, so in this case, TP of 14 pips would be perfect. SL of 10-15%(7-11 pips in this example) I know it seems so small but I think it fits better for M30. Of course, these are just my thoughts and we each need to trade in our own way. CAD/JPY - M30 COMMENTS ON FIRST AND SECOND TOUCH Attached Image (click to enlarge) This isn't meant to be a criticism, just an observation. Also, Osa's winning USD/JPY trade was technically a "second" touch trade as well so it shows it can be fine. I just tend to try and pass on the second/third touch if I missed the first touch.

Hello brother. I just wanted to thank you again. This indicator has made it so much easier to scan through pairs and timeframes. Click click click to see not only the most recent setup but past setups as well. I find that pairs go thru harmonic cycles where they tend to react consistently to these fractal lines and this indi makes it so easy to check each valid structure. Then once I find my setups I can manually adjust the lines the way I like, especially so the EA description isn't cluttering up the price action. I forgot to add this indi to the first post. I'll do that now. Cheers!

Good morning/afternoon/evening friends. Neither order filled. I wasn't really expecting them to fill as the dollar is bid across the board for now. However, I have been playing USD/CAD like a fiddle and doing very well. Nothing to do with the fractal system. I've been studying this pair for 13 years in relation to oil and equities, in particular, US equities. Then using a mental correlation strategy to enter and exit trades. NOTE: Post #1 has been updated with some new SL/TP parameters. I also added the new auto drawing indicator made by our friend "arby1108". I still haven't fully tested the modified EA indicator that "O_s_a" made for us. So far the only thing I noticed was that it won't trigger if "trigger=0". I could be wrong but I'll try to do more testing before we replace the original EA on post #1. Thanks again to Oskar

I don't trade the US SP500 Index but I do use it when I'm using it for correlation with USD/CAD. SP 500 H1 - FRACTAL LINE WITH TRIANGLE CONFLUENCE Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I'd be buying USD/CAD when the index touches the line/triangle as USD/CAD tends to inversely correlate with equities and oil.

One of our 4 pending orders filled. A good example of the precision of the fractal line and the reason I'm using smaller and smaller SL's. Sadly it only filled on 1 of my 4 brokers. What a difference a pip or less can make, or a spread that's a half pip different on a different broker. Still, an easy 10 pips. In and out. Nonetheless, we won't chase the second touch.

UPDATES: Our GBP/USD and AUD/CAD orders finally filled. GBP/USD filled while I was sleeping but during one of my many bathroom breaks, I manually closed for +18 pips. Again a tiny SL was needed as price only went 3 pips past our line. We did not chase the 2nd or 3rd touch. The 2nd touch went 6 pips past the line, and the 3rd touch went 21 pips past the line. We are looking for a quick and violent rejection off the line. A quick in and out trade. This trade reminds me of my workouts. If I'm doing leg presses or bicep curls or whatever I finish each muscle group with the "exhaustion" method. I start out with a lightweight warm-up. Then work each set up to the maximum weight with a few minutes of rest in between sets. When I get to the max weight I start to decrease weight back to the original weight but with basically no rest in between sets so that the muscle reaches total exhaustion. In this trade, the Pound was chasing the fractal line that was moving away from price. Up and rest, up some more and rest, and eventually, after 2 days price reached the line with total exhaustion and got a quick 20 pip sell-off in 20 minutes. And that's all I'm looking for. In and out. Might not seem like much but 20-30 pips a day makes one very well off financially in a few years. GBP/USD M30 - FRACTAL LINE WINNING RESULT +18 PIPS Attached Image (click to enlarge) The AUD/CAD trade filled when I was awake this morning and I manually closed for -3 pips. It took 2 days for the order to fill. Since the fractal line was moving "towards" price it means it requires less momentum for the price to reach the line and breakthrough. With no real violent reaction at the line, I decided to close out manually for a small loss. I'm looking for more setups where the fractal line is moving away from price. That way price is chasing the line and using up more and more momentum as time goes on and will hopefully reach exhaustion at the line. And now you can since on the current chart that price indeed has broken through the line so we saved ourselves a full loss. AUD/CAD H4 - FRACTAL LINE LOSING RESULT -3 PIPS Attached Image (click to enlarge) And one more that I manually entered very early this morning and yet another example of NOT chasing the second touch and another example of a fractal line that is moving away from price.

Hello brother It looks like you had a chance to take 7 or 8 pips. If not, hopefully, you got the recovery trade. I noticed you have a lot of trades with CHF. I personally stay away from CHF pairs because for one it requires too much margin with US brokers and I find price action is really choppy with CHF pairs. And for any swing trades, buying USD/CHF is the same as selling EUR/USD and EUR/USD costs 2K margin per lot while USD/CHF costs 5K margin per lot . Another thing I have been doing is trying to stay away from some of the more volatile cross pairs like GBP/NZD, EUR/AUD, etc etc as they don't seem to work as well for me. Could just be my personal preference but I find the major pairs along with the YEN crosses seem to exhibit better harmonic behavior which suits this method well. Just thinking out loud though Ah, gardening, one of my favorite hobbies. Just got my tomato/pepper/tomatillo seeds started indoors yesterday. It's supposed finally to warm up to 15-20 Celcius this weekend. Probably a month more until the danger of the last frost passes before I can transplant outdoors but I can do some cool weather crops now like broccoli and peas.

One last mention. I have found that Bitcoin for me has worked extremely well, even on the 15-minute timeframe. Unfortunately, FTMO is the only broker out of the 4 I'm using that allows Bitcoin trading. Spreads aren't great but with such good volatility and small SL, it can be very profitable. This one happened while I was asleep but I'm not sure how to set the pip parameters with the EA yet. I'm going to test the EA with a demo to find out so I can set pending orders.

And........because life is more than trading I thought I'd share this. We live at about 1400 meters above sea level and we are only about a one-hour drive to the famous Lake Tahoe resort which is about 3000 meters above sea level. Anyways, through one of my bird lover groups, I found out about a place I've never heard of...Chickadee Ridge Trail. Apparently, if you put your hand out with or without seed, the local Mountain Chickadees will land on your hand. So on Sunday, it will be a warm Springy 20 Celcius, with lots of snow still at that elevation, so my daughter and I are going to plan a day hike/picnic up there and I'm going to bring my zoom lens and get some pictures of this experience.

Thanks, my friend. My daughter and I went up to the Lake Tahoe summit yesterday but there is still 5-10 feet of snow and since it was 15 Celcius we needed snowshoes which we don't have. But, we found the trailhead and will plan another trip when the snow melts. Sometimes the snow doesn't melt until June or July or later up there I have my tomatoes/peppers/etc started indoors. Probably 4-6 weeks before the threat of the last frost before I can transplant them outdoors. As for the trading, I look for good separation, smooth waves, and waves that have decent symmetry. Like anything, more time looking at examples gives us a better idea of what works and what doesn't. Also, I am taking profits earlier rather than later. If my SL is 10 and my TP is 20 then I'm setting my BE for 10 pips. I'm not taking a loss if price bounces 10 pips in my favor. Afterall, this truly is a quasi scalping method on higher time frames so I have no problem taking manual profits before the TP is hit. Off to the park for a picnic/playdate with my daughter's friend. The warmest day of the Spring so far! Cheers and safe trading this week.

You have a greenhouse. That is awesome! My grandfather who passed away 20 years ago was my inspiration for gardening. I'll never forget one day in 1972 when I was 5 years old. I would follow him around his big garden. He dug some big holes in a row for some tomato plants and then he said, "reach into that bucket boy and put some of that dirt in the hole for me". Well, the "dirt" kind of smelled funny because it wasn't dirt it was cow manure! He could of at least given me some gloves to wear! I had never seen a cow yet at that point in my life as I was born in the city of Philadelphia. Then we moved to upstate New York where I finally saw my first cow. So technically your first chart is NOT a first touch because theoretically, the fractal "D" had not formed yet as you pointed out. That situation happens a lot where price bounces off a line that technically doesn't exist yet. However, it shows that the plane of price action is valid assuming that D will eventually become a fractal. Your EUR/CAD trade was a masterpiece! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Manual close for +9 pips. Oil sold off as well as US equity futures. If they bounce up even a little at market open USD/CAD will fall and we will get stopped out at BE. That will put a bad taste in my mouth. So I decided to add a little icing on the cake for the day and take the pips. I might start opening 2 positions so I can leave one running and book profit on the other.

I'm wondering. Don't You consider the early price action as 1st touch? I understand Your point here but just want to now Your opinion.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
And I'm curious about Your opinion about this Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Yes, there was already the first touch for sure. This was just me trying to be creative and flexible in my trading. The fractal line described price so well for so long that I wanted to give this trade a try, especially after price finally had such a clear break away from the line.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Great question! I was hoping price might make it back up when there would be a confluence between the fractal line and horizontal triangle convergence line but that clearly isn't going to happen now. As such I would sell the fractal line on the first touch as usual. Then at a later time if price reached the horizontal line I would sell the first touch as well.

That is such a cool instrument and sound! I've never heard of handpans before your post, so thanks. Speaking of extreme talent and artistry, one of the best guitar players in the world is Tommy Emmanuel. I saw him in concert a few years back and he is incredible, though I have to say that the music I most enjoy is the more melodic and less "athletic". Still, I admire his technical skill. I saw an interview of him in which he was asked what he did with his free time when he was on tour, and for the most part, he said he just hung out in the hotel room and practiced for hours. This guy is an example of not only 10k hrs of practice, but well above that. (By the way, 10k hours is equivalent to 1.14 years, 24 hrs/day, 365 days/year of actual time. Put another way, if one spends 40hrs/week doing something, 52 wks/year, you'll get your 10k hours in ~4.8 years!).

Hi pips. You're welcome and thanks for posting. Yea, the handpan is a modern improvement over similar instruments of the past. They've really only been making them for about 15 years. There are about a dozen or so high-quality makers around the globe. I bought one from a well-known maker here in the US and it wasn't cheap! Well, I've got more than my 10K hours on the forex charts. Maybe 2K hours on guitar and about 200 hours on the handpan . I stumbled onto some of Tommy's stuff in my constant search for music that is more instrumental in nature. In particular, I am very fond of acoustic guitar, especially Spanish guitar.

We had to close this manually for -10 pips as the daily reset was approaching so it was either close or widen the SL to make it thru the reset. Another failed trade where the fractal line is moving "towards" price. For example, it takes less price movement/momentum to reach the fractal line. I am generally looking for setups where the fractal line is moving away from price. In that way price must "chase" the line more and more as time elapses, thus using up more and more kinetic energy. I am finding that those setups are more successful for me.

I wanted to show an example of an important concept that I think warrants consideration. I've blabbered on about it several times so I thought I'd put the words into the charts. It's the concept of price momentum and price exhaustion when it meets our fractal line. So we have the two scenarios. 1) The fractal line is moving towards price 2) The fractal line is moving away from price In these two theoretical examples let's assume that price ranges for 3 days. For example, in exactly 72 hours, the price is exactly the same as it is today for both pairs. SCENARIO #1 - After 72 hours price is only 23 pips from our fractal line and now needs very little downward price momentum to reach our fractal line. So, in theory, it should be easier for price to break through our fractal line = less chance of a successful trade. GBP/JPY H1 - FRACTAL LINE MOVING TOWARDS PRICE Attached Image (click to enlarge) SCENARIO #2 - After 72 hours price is 93 pips from our fractal line and now needs a lot of upwards price momentum to reach our fractal line. So, in theory, it should be harder for price to break through our fractal line as it would more likely reach price exhaustion at that point = better chance for a successful trade. USD/JPY H1 - FRACTAL LINE MOVING AWAY FROM PRICE Attached Image (click to enlarge) NOTE: More often than not, a fractal line moving towards price means you are likely trading in the direction of the trend. A fractal line moving away from price means you are more than likely trading against the trend. In a ranging market, it could be either-or. However, we aren't really trend trading or swing trading (not that those are bad), we are quasi scalping higher time frames.

Lol can't say I blame them. It's a weird but unique strategy that seems simple enough but would require some practice before one can gain the confidence to take first touch trades without anxiety and hesitation. Or maybe most just prefer to watch and see things unfold for entertainment, like myself.

I imagine some traders do get anxious. They can always wait to see if there is a reaction at the line(validation), then wait for the line to break, and then buy/sell the other side. Similar to what a trader using regular trend lines might do. BUT, the secret sauce is in the fractal lines. Just don't come complaining to me if you get diarrhea.

This is a real strategy. 10 rules and observations to follow. Thats a lot for anybody looking for the proverbial MA cross KISS strat and the like. A lot of work to put in here. But where one puts the work, one reaps the reward. Common ! I like the looks of this, but man the lines ! so many lines, its like when Im too drunk to put the spaghetti in to cook, and drop it all over the floor! One too many glasses of Pinot NoiRRR! apologies !

--- 帖子 #513 ---
This is for a sell ? I would think it was for a buy.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Would this be an option also ?

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Initially, it WAS a buy of the "first touch" as I've shown on the chart. However, if we missed the setup or were anxious about using the first touch principle, then we could wait for the line to break and then sell the retest of the line. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Absolutely, that is exactly where the "first touch" buy would be. I posted my chart before reading this post. Well played good sir

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Have you tried making the entries and exits and lines creation all objective? A lot of work, but perhaps it would be worth it. For now, I see too many possible trades. It's a truly cool discretionary strategy, but I am more of a robot type dude when it comes to trading. I like this though, will see how I can factor it in my own system of strategies.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Well, which structure you choose will always be subjective for me. Yes, there are many many valid structures throughout the day but most don't meet my criteria for good structures. For example, messy impulse waves, waves too close together, waves with only 2 candles, no real price separation, huge wicks at the fractal, fractals that form on the daily reset candle, and many other scenarios that I find are not good structures to use and will not model the plane of price action very well going forward. As I stated previously, each trader is unique and each trade is unique to their own perception of what makes a good structure. The example on post #1 for me is the kind of structure I am looking for because: 1) All 3 waves are nicely uniform 2) The waves have a nice spacing and aren't skewed in their direction relative to one another. (basically parallel) 3) The waves are fairly similar in length (not one super long wave with a super short wave) 4) The waves are not too far apart or too close together 5) 3 out for 4 fractals are major 6) Distinct price separation at the 7th candle close 7) No huge wicks at the fractals 8) No fractals formed during the daily reset hour Attached Image (click to enlarge)

First of all i would like to thank you for your amazing work, Second of all I LOVE FRACTALS, so when i saw this strat i fall in love immediately since my main strat works around fractals. I found this setup today on GOLD but i was too late to enter could check if it's a correct one

You're welcome friend and thanks for posting. This is how I see it. It would have been a perfect entry! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #522 ---
A valid setup for sure. As I always say each trade is unique and each trader is unique in how they see a particular setup. I'm always looking for other subtle forms of confluence. Maybe an untested fractal line on a different time frame coincides with the newest setup on this time frame. Maybe the entry falls on an important Fibonacci level. Correlations with other instruments. Supply and demand levels. Wickless trendlines. Pivots. Anything extra to give me an edge. Sometimes I just love the structure and go for it! Here's a live trade I'm in. I entered a manual "FOMO" position because there were two untested fractal lines and I wanted to make sure I got at least one entry. Two lines are better than one, right? Not the best-looking structures but the fact that they are confluent overrides their ugly nature NZD/USD H4 - TWO CONFLUENT UNTESTED FRACTAL LINES Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We had 2 of our 4 pending orders fill. We manually took +11 pips from our USD/CHF H1 (left lots on the table here as usual) Attached Image (click to enlarge) And we lost -14 pips on our EUR/NZD trade. Ironically, I was up for a bathroom break at 2AM and considered ending this order but didn't. Then of course an easy recovery trade missed as I was sleeping. Volatile cross pair with the fractal line moving towards price, a recipe for a loser. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm thinking that it would be better for me to only trade the "first touch" on fractal lines moving away from price. For fractal lines moving towards price, wait for the line to break then buy/sell the other side.

Pending order from last week getting closer. Love this type of setup. Fractal line moving away from price.

Losing trade that filled while asleep. Looks like price reacted +11 pips before blasting through the line. (SL to BE on EA was set to 12 pips ). No chance for micromanagement or a recovery trade when your sleeping. I think the other EA I was using had an option to buy/sell a trendline after it was broken with a candle close. I'll have to look into that as optimal trading hours our my sleep time and this method is surely more effective if you are awake during the order fill.

I absolutely agree with you, I consider fractals as a girl who she either love or hate you from first sight after that it's just mood swing from hate to love or hate to hate you even more, so it's better take the sure thing, which the first touch

I think those island girls are making you crazy

--- 帖子 #538 ---
For anyone that's interested here is the other EA for buying/selling the trendline. This one allows you to buy/sell the line on a pullback. For example, price goes past the line with a candle close, then it can buy/sell the retouch of the line.

Probably a cultural difference. In more direct language, your thread is a very good one. Your method has a lot of solid components to it. Most importantly, you are using it in real time on a funded account. You are not getting a lot of posts because everyone is taking notes who can understand what you are putting out, and those that cannot need to go back to babypips, so they cannot be trolls either. Okay, that's enough from me. Edit: In my case, for example, while I do not take entries the way that you do, the dynamic trendlines are excellent ways to evaluate any active trades to determine whether or not it is time to get out with profit, tighten the stop, or add to a position. I am never too old to add to my toolbox.

Hello traders, we have some setups to start the week but will wait to set any pending orders until the market has some liquidity. From here on forward I will only trade fractal lines moving towards price by waiting for the line to break and then buying/selling the other side. I will only trade the first touch for fractal lines moving away from price and will catalog the angle of the fractal line that to see if steeper angles lines are better overall. Of course, if I get frustrated I will go insane and just start clicking buttons and hope for the best AUD/USD H1 - FRACTAL LINE MOVING AWAY FROM PRICE (11.4 DEGREES) Attached Image (click to enlarge) USD/JPY M30 - TWO FRACTAL LINES BOTH MOVING AWAY FROM PRICE (LINE#1 - 25.1 DEGREES, LINE 2 - 21.3 DEGREES) Attached Image (click to enlarge) GBP/NZD H4 - FRACTAL LINE MOVING TOWARDS PRICE https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter...rom=GBP&amp;To=NZD shows this pair gapping up above the line on market open which is perfect as we can then wait for liquidity and then buy the retrace back to the line Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We took a manual entry on GBP/NZD. Pretty risky for a Sunday afternoon trade but we are sticking with the plan of buying a retrace back to a broken fractal line.

Oops. Packed up my tripod and zoom lens and went down to the local watershed to do some wildlife photography and forgot to set my pending orders for the setups I found. Missed the first touch on USD/JPY and of course, price perfectly touched the line before bouncing 12 pips. But it's only 12 pips, right? Wrong. Attention to detail is everything in trading. Why scour the charts for a few good setups and then miss the moment. I could have taken 12 pips profit. I could have tightened my SL and gave myself a really good risk/reward situation. Or, I could have moved my SL to BE for a risk-free running trade. But instead, I got a bad taste in my mouth and that could lead to some impatient trading. Maybe chase a trade that isn't a good setup. USD/JPY M30 - THE MISSED ENTRY UPDATED CHART Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hey there Expo33, Thanks very much sharing this system. I'm currently testing it out, hopefully I'm trading it correctly and will post some screenshots soon. BTW I noticed you also started the Wolf Waves thread back in 2017. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...et-in-the-zone If I recall correctly within that thread you mentioned something like 70% of your trades at the time were based on Wolf Waves. Curious to know if that is still the case or if you've moved on and replaced your bread and butter trades with Fractal Geometry? Also do you find if there is much correlation between the two systems? I was very interested in Wolf Waves years ago before I realized you started a thread on this. Much appreciated for all your efforts and dedication on doing so. On a personal note, hats off to you for being a single dad. I was one myself for many years and understand how tough it can be. Thanks, Timo

--- 帖子 #563 ---
@Expo33 - thank you for sharing the indicator and very simple methodology. The way I see it is that trading is about direction first then entry mechanism. This entry method of yours is very powerful IMO. To me, the whole market just consists of 1-2-3 patterns making new HHs and LLs. The exactly formation of the 1-2-3 pattern can be a bit messy but this is where the fun comes in ;-) https://pipbear.com/price-action-pattern/1-2-3/ . What I try and do is just see where we are on the current 1-2-3 pattern coming from the monthly going down the TFs. The 1-2-3 is only confirmed with a close above/below 2. No wicks. "As famous trader and father of the Turtles, Richard Dennis said: “I always say that you could publish my trading rules in the newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are 80% as good as what we taught our people. What they couldn’t do is give them the confidence to stick to those rules even when things are going bad.” – from Market Wizards, by Jack D. Schwager." Looking to kickstart this thread and hopefully swapping observations. I AM COMPLETLEY OPEN TO ANY CRITIQUE AS LONG AS IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE. GU Entry Screenshot Attached Below as per the thread. Structure: MN - Up (could be leg 2 retracement up but important to note it's going up and it's a monthly retracement) W1 - Looks like leg 3 Up and the high should be taken D1 - Looks like leg 2 retracement down for the next leg up and big wick rejection yesterday H4 - Structure Technically down (1-2-3 pattern down) but we came to fresh demand yesterday which could kick it back inline with the daily+ Based on that am only interested in longs. Watching the rejection. My trading style is my own. I very rarely take touch entries. I need to see price rejecting the line. I understand I miss the premium price but my priority is win rate. I like lines that act as dynamic SnR. So when price crosses the fractal line and tests is from the other side and then respects it. It must be a swift and powerful engulf/cross for me to consider it. In a few of your examples price kind of crosses the FL then accumulates then pulls away. I need a CLEAN break with big bodied candles as the ideal scenario. This example of GU is not ideal but can see the FL is acting as dynamic SnR and there is a QM zone to target with confluence. Wicks to the FL indicate rejection in my desired direction. The first time back also seems really good but I like to see some kind of zone confluence with it. Fresh Sup/Dem/QM or a kink of a fresh flag limit mainly. The way I see it is that geometry seems to highlight liquidity pockets in the market. I have NO IDEA how this works as all the market is, is buyers and sellers trying to complete their transactions at the lowest possible cost. Therefore essentially a liquidity seeking mechanism. However I have seen the reactions from TL's enough times to know, it would be foolish to ignore this theory even if the way it works makes zero sense to me.

GU Update, Entry was made on M5 after the first 1-2-3 formation and I went for the re-test of the 2 point. A M15 1-2-3 pattern would be nice to see now but as price is fractal M5 forms first then M15. ALL my trades are 1.5R. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Update on GU attached. :-) EU looks very messy to me, I can't see anything clear. It's a real shame as the price and time symmetry looked good to me as it was setting up.

Slim pickings today but watching this:

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Didn't see this in time but was clean

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Entry made on M5 Engulf. Need a retrace to get triggered. Possible M1 QM.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Another possibility. I'm watching

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Result: Win. 1.5R. Retrace triggered trade and then looked like it was going for the double top so I widened by SL a very little to account for spread. If that high was spiked by more than 1 pip, I would have been out and wouldn't have re-entered. Range I saw was a little tight so SL had to go there.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Next one will be this depending on H4 close. I will enter on H4 engulf. We can see that expanding Fractal Line channel that was holding price and we have had a nice breakout supported by the M15 supply formed + 1-2-3 M15 Pattern

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Entry made on H4 at the close. No need to look at Lower TFs on this one. SL above the swing high.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Last one for the week. Fractal Line on M30 acting as dynamic S&amp;R. We have a strong break back above. HTF structure strong to upside. Break &amp; Re-test on M5 is the entry.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Update - SL hit on this one. Am done for the week. Will re-assess the trade once I can see how it played out. Update - It wasn't the cleanest FL but I had a strong bias from the HTFs which is why I took it. Once we had a clean break on the other side with pricing creating 1-2-3 patterns it looked good to me. However, it looks like I got caught in some messy price action.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Next one, EU. We have intersection of Trend Line + Fractal Line on M30. The intersection of the two lines is a good horizontal level for liquidity. There is also a fractal line on M30 that I haven't drawn in the screenshot but it's where price rejected to the downside. M15 shows the initial rejection but then price goes higher. If it was going to reject back down, it should have done it from there so a push higher signifies higher prices. Entered after the M15 bullish candle with a slight retrace.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Result: 1.5R Win. Nice start to the week.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Next AU After the failure of the trade on Friday, it looks bearish short term. That triangle zone that is drawn from a H4 Fractal Line and M30 Fractal Line and seems to be holding price. Confirm is H1 engulf and I need a retrace for entry.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Update: Breakeven. The entry was on point &amp; price completed the H&amp;S pattern and made a LL so I didn't see the need for price to come back up. Later today we have AUD news and HTF we are still bullish so was a risky trade. I was looking for a clean move here and initially it looked good. Lastly I didn't want to be stuck in the trade coming into NY changeover and risk slippage with news so decided to take the risk off after the LL.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Next trade UCHF: Overall HTF Bearish We have two fractal lines. Nice 1-2-3 break on M5 of them both. Hoping for a re-test of the lower one for entry.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Missed entry so will cancel the order for now.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
GN Next, H4 engulf confirmed shorts. Price came down with momentum and broke the fractal line on H1. Entry was after M30 rejection of the line. The below zone is fresh so high chance of price to make it down there.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Update: Win. 1.5R. Price came down nicely to the zone that was fresh. I was looking for a move like this yesterday with AU. It was very unlucky yesterday coming to my breakeven point then reversing to TP but just how it goes sometimes.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Day Off yesterday due to FOMC. To kick things off we have EJ. HTF Bullish. H1 TrendLine + M15 Fractal Line intersection giving us a zone to play off. VERY nice break of the M15 FL &amp; M15 shows rejection wick of the zone. Entered on a small pullback. Today we have ECB and BOE announcing interest rates so a little risky taking this ahead of that but let's see.

Update - SL hit. Got caught in a fake-out. Will wait and re-assess. Re-entry possible.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
No trades on Friday, nothing clear due to NFP and huge momentum moves creating no structure. First one for this week, CADCHF. HTFs overall bearish but currently consolidating after a big bearish run. H1 shows break of structure to the downside inline with overall bias. Price comes back and rejects both trend lines and a M5 fractal line perfectly with a M15 engulf. We also have a zone there when price broke structure. Target is demand to the downside which is a conservative target. SL above the zone holding price.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Update - SL hit. Trade looked good when we had the first push down as the zone was holding and we had a Double Top + break of the neckline but it reversed before TP. Need to see what happens next now. No re-entries. Update - Trade looked good at time of entry. Engulfing candles further confirmed the move to downside after entry. It can be seen that price is just dripping up which was not possible to know at the time of the trade where momentum and price action looked good. There was good geometry and zone confluence and so was just a valid loss. Can now see the clean move turned into a complete mess and just got caught in some messy price action.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Didn't see anything clear yesterday. Here we have UJ. M30 structure has been broken to the downside and we have the Fractal Line (Red) + Trend Line (White) triangle at that point. All HTFs look bearish to me. We had the first break up last week but still early to tell if structure is shifting. Alternative scenario could be price coming for the third touch of the upper TL and if that happens I will look for re-entries there.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Update - Breakeven. I didn't like price action so put the trade to breakeven first chance I got and am out. Price has been somewhat erratic recently so trading cautiously and I didn't like how it was rejecting the Fractal Line with a M15 Engulf Up. I wanted to see a clean break of the fractal line back down. Will still look for shorts from upper Trend Line, let's see...

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Next one here we have UCHF. HTF is bearish. We have a big move up here right to a M15 Fractal Line that seems to historically hold price. We also have the confluence of a SnR zone there. On H1 there is a nice range to the next zone but I am just going for the lows here. We can see price rejecting the FL with a doji on M15 and the engulf was the confirm for entry.

Hello Traders and thank you to all of you who messaged me about this strategy. I've been far too busy with life to post here but I am officially back!! I've been working on a Youtube channel and will be posting some videos in the future. It's much easier to communicate some of the new wrinkles using video format. But, just to get the ball rolling again we have the dream set up for a USD/CAD sell. Two untested Fractal Lines that are relatively confluent are better than one. The EA is set to sell the green fractal line. Off to bed now, see if we get a fill over night. USD/CAD 1H - TWO CONFLUENT UNTESTED FRACTAL LINES. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Our sell order was triggered overnight and we got stopped out. No worries though as this strategy uses very tight stops, in this case, 12 pips When price smashes through our Fractal Lines we know that there is at least strong short-term momentum. In this case, likely from the uncertainty with the US debt ceiling saga along with the corresponding equity sell-off. However, this is just a good opportunity to initiate a recovery trade. We now just wait to buy a retrace back to the original fractal lines. USD/CAD 1H RECOVERY TRADE AFTER FRACTAL LINES VIOLATED. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Buddy, hello! Do you have a new version of the indicator with letters or is it an old version and did you arrange the letters yourself?

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hello! I arranged the letters myself just so people understand what I'm doing. When I'm looking for a setup I don't put the letters on the chart I just use the "fractal geometry" indicator from post #1 to quickly check many setups to see if I like any of them. If I do, I then draw the lines manually and then set the EA to buy/sell etc. I'm posting from my phone. Away from desktop until later tonight. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

One thing to note if anyone tries using the trendline EA is that it is set to "points" and not "pips". The thread discussing the rules on how to use it doesn't mention it but if you want for example your SL to be 10 pips then you need to put in 100 in the trendline description. It would be nice if someone could make this EA less cumbersome to use

This trade was filled and was a loser for 12 pips. However, if you look a little closer into what actually happened it reveals why I like this strategy so much. My EA was set with a 20-pip TP with a 12-pip SL and was set to move the SL to break even after 10 pips. As it turns out price actually bounced about 5 pips after the original first touch of our fractal line. So, if I was sitting at the computer at the time of the first touch I would still have the option of taking a 5-pip profit or of moving the SL to break even after the 5-pip bounce. As it happened, the trade was filled during my sleep time. Nonetheless, the theory that a broken fractal line shows strong price momentum gives us a chance at a recovery trade by trading in the new direction. Once we get a convincing candle close past the broken fractal line, we just wait to sell a retrace back to the fractal line.

UPDATE : We got our order filled overnight. The EA was set for a 16-pip SL with a 32-pip TP and was set to move the SL to BE after 16 pips green. It looks like we got as high as +25 pips in the green so now the SL is at BE. Now we are sitting at +6 pips and will let this run a little longer and will have to close it out before the daily rollover provided we don't get stopped out at BE first. I might start setting these trades up with two fractal lines within a pip of each other that way I can bank one trade with a smaller TP and let the other one run its course seeing as I'm usually asleep when these trades get filled.

Do your fractal points have any particular requirements to use them as ABCD? It's looks very simple construction but have the feeling is not really so simple

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Merka, sorry for the late response. The answers are all in post #1 RULES/OBSERVATIONS #1) Fractals A, B, C, and D must be alternating highs and lows and vice versa. #2) Major fractals are better than minor fractals but both are valid. Fractal D is the completion of our structure and can only appear after the 7th candle close (minor fractal). Major fractals appear after the 12th candle close. #3) There can be NO other fractals between AB, BC, or CD #4) We are looking for "uniform" impulse waves. We don't want to see messy, jagged price action between our fractal points. #5) When fractal D appears we can then draw our structure. At this point, we want to see "price separation" from our fractal line (FL). #6) Be EXTREMELY accurate in your drawing making sure your fractal line goes perfectly through each impulse wave midpoint. Entries are everything and can be remarkably different if the drawing is inaccurate. #7) Note that some brokers use New York candle close time and some don't. Also, different spreads may affect when or if a fractal actually prints so you can get different structures or no structure at all for the same pair. The theory is still valid as long as you are consistent with your drawings. #8) You do not have to buy/sell the first touch. If you feel that there is too much fundamental momentum when price is approaching your fractal line, then you can wait to see if price breaks through your fractal line with a convincing candle close past that line. Then you can buy/sell the other side of the line upon the first retracement back to the line. In essence, this would be like a trend continuation trade. #9) We aren't trying to predict some big trend change. We are scalping fractal lines using higher time frames. #10) Don't hesitate to enter a bit early with a FOMO trade. Maybe one entry a few pips before the line and one on the touch, then take profits on one early and let the other run if it's going in your favor. Be creative with your micromanagement.

You're welcome. So you're using the zig-zag and then taking the wickless points for your AB and CD. Interesting I will use the wickless points if one or more of my fractal points has a large wick. Then I'll draw the corresponding "wickless" fractal line to see if it matches up well with the normal fractal line. If it does, I'll use the setup. If not, I don't use that setup

Hi Goratcio. I'm not sure what fractal indicator you are using but it looks like you are using a period of 12. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Yes...I'm using line charts ( which do not show the wicks ). The bar " closes " have always proven to be of greater value than the wicks. Although many will disagree with this. See in the chart the rectangle ( price pivot zones ) as named by James 16 and notice where price has turned ...as of now at least. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hi Kadak and thanks for the post. There would not be any sell until the price has touched the fractal line. So on your chart I see you have a sell order which would not be correct until price hits the line. Or, you could wait for the price to break through the fractal line and then wait for a retrace back to the line to buy. Getting on a plane for vacation soon. Will check back later tonight if you have any more questions. Cheers. See chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #673 ---
You have to be careful with the indicator. If you click on a fractal dot that is not the start of a valid structure the indicator will still try to draw a fractal line. In your example this is not a valid fractal line. Fractals need to be alternating. Either high low high low, OR low high low high. Your chart has low, high, high, low. It still might work but it's not a valid fractal line according to this strategy and the rules in post #1.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Sorry for the late response. You can lock the fractal lines in place when using the FractalsGeometry indicator while working on the chart by hitting the "F" key and you make them disappear by hitting the "C" key. HOWEVER, the fractal lines will disappear when you close the platform. I only use the indicator to check a bunch of setups quickly to see if any of them fit into my plan. If they do, I will then put the lines onto the chart manually using the "draw trendline" tool on the taskbar. Then I lock them into place and they will stay on the chart even when I close the platform.

Nice thread and nice setup indeed! Especially RR if you check the higher TF. I also use fractal geometry but combined with dynamics measured by an oscillator model. It shows that the local top(or bottom across the board not only UC) is yet to be verified so there is serious risk of price taking it out. Probabilities for that outcome raise as it's NFP FRY-DAY where stop hunting is a tradition. Thanks for the insight, take care and if you can drop by my thread to check . Salute 7
